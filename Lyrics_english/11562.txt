I Saw You in a Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Said that we'd be friends
But broken wings just need some time to mend
You're trying hard to fly
Sometimes it's just better to lay down and cry
And you called me up
I don't think I was feeling happy now
Moving on
Isn't it about time somebody won?

[Chorus]
I saw you in a dream
I was letting you just float downstream
I saw you in a dream
I was tired of sending you out to sea
[Verse 2]
Love will win in the end
I've got a lot of faith in that, my friend
It's working now for me
Maybe not so much for you but soon we'll see

[Chorus]
I saw you in a dream
I was letting just float downstream
I saw you in a dream
I was tired of sending you out to sea

[Outro]
And I was trying to help you, help you get back
Now I'm just keeping our hearts aliveYou might also likeEmbed
