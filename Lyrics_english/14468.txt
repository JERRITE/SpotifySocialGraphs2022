Where are you lyrics ["where you are" letter]

[Intro]
(OHH-OH, YE-EH-EH)
Ah, Khea, Yeah (EH; Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I need something for the head (-reza)
Is that girl no longer kisses me (kisses)
I mix the molly with the beer and go to see if I see it
I threw my love without a parachute '
I took the passage with a trip only
I know that for my mistake you gave me out
And now I want to go back in
[Chorus]
Where are you? That today I am going to look for you
To remind you what we once were
And where are you? (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) that I'm going to look for you today
To remind you what we once were (you and me)

[Verse 2]
We were both (two)
I thought nothing could kill this love (Yeah-eh; this love)
And he who killed him was me, ey ​​(Yeah)
I curse that error (error), damn that rum (ron)
That took me to hell with the first devil that happened
And now I spend seeing your stories (stories)
Your body, ma ', I know from Memorry

[Chorus]
Where are you? That today I am going to look for you
To remind you what we once were
And where are you? (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) that I'm going to look for you today
To remind you what we once were (you and me)

[Bridge]
Our discussions were the clear reason to make this follow
I ask you to forgive me, that you forgive me

[Chorus]
Where are you? That today I am going to look for you
To remind you what we once were
And where are you? (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) that I'm going to look for you today
To remind you what we once were (you and me)
