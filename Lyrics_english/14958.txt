Lacquer Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes bored and sometimes lonely
Pimple faced and rather homely
He wasn't much for socializin'
The TV kept a mesmerizin'
In one ear and out the other
Picked up a trick from his older brother
Got him a can of sniffin' sauce
Pinned his mind up on a cross

[Chorus]
Lacquer head knows but one desire
Lacquer head sets his skull on fire
Lacquer head knows no in betweens
Huffin' on bags of gasoline
[Verse 2]
Sniffin' paint since the seventh grade
She was high on gin and gatorade
On turpentine she lost her luck
Fell in front of a speeding pick-up truck
He was a boy of soft demeanor
And he loved his carburetor cleaner
The vapor made a sweet aroma
He sniffed himself into a coma

[Chorus]
Lacquer head knows but one desire
Lacquer head sets his skull on fire
Lacquer head knows no in betweens
Huffin' on bags of gasoline

[Break]
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes pop
Keep on sniffin' till your brain goes, POP!
