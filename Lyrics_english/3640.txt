TranslationSromanizationEnglish even if you die (It's Definitely You) Lyrics

[Verse 1: V, Jin]
I like it with a beeping gold
Your sighs
Like a little bit of a flower that little by little
Heart down
Because of this love of the guy to kill
I can't stop even if I get hurt
Even if I die, I am you
Tears to penetrate the breasts that you don't have
Only black hell to fall
You are like that to me
[Chorus: V, Jin]
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Turn your heart back to me.
It's all my life because I want you to be eager
Take me to the scattered light, and to the end of the world
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
Wow uh uh
I Can't Let go

[Verse 2: V, Jin]
The key to my destiny left in heaven
In my hand again
Swallow long breath and burn souls
Trying to take you
Because of this love of the guy to kill
I can't give up even if I get sick
Even if I die, I am you
I don't have blood or tears
It's just a dangerous shadow
You are like that to me
You might Also Like [Chorus: V, Jin]
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Turn your heart back to me.
It's all my life because I want you to be eager
Take me to the scattered light
Until the end of the world
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
Wow uh uh
I Can't Let go
I'll give you me and keep you
I'll try it as if it were seen
I'm trying to make this crisis an opportunity now
You can't stop my best choice
Take me to the scattered light
Until the end of the world
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
It's Gotta be you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
Wow uh uh
I Can't Let go
[OUTRO: Jin]
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, NA
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na6embed
