[Enter: Lenny Tavárez]
Me'
She says: "Always alone, how bad accompanies'"
Na 'to explain, nobody scolds her
Pa 'go out with a harmful mind'
Puts "camouflage" since it bathes
Get over, get with my body (with my body)
Get over, don't waste time (This is the office remix)
[Pre-car: Bryant Myers & Jay Wheeler]

He disguises himself to hide his identity
Get what you want without any need
With that face and that sensual body (Yeah-Yeah)
And it transforms when the moon falls
If you don't know her 'well, he can fall in love (Oah)
Her flow does not have any
It always attracts attention where they see her arrive

[Chorus: Nio García]
I-I, I know
Which are little 'what they have put', but they know it much
She and like the moon, only goes night (eh-eh)
Which are little 'what they have put' but they know it a lot

[Post-Coro: Nio García]
Today he got pretty, he made his nails and hair
Premiered the new outfit
She sleeps with whoever wants
But not anyone can be his jevo

[Verse 1: Miky Woodz]
(Baby, let yourself be carried away by the og; don't vote for you)
Much 'know her (Yeah), little' have put her '(ey)
And that is the most 'that runs from it, and' that has not run '(you know it; uh)
He has to 'the' male 'on his Instagram Metio' (Huh-Uh)
Seeing how 'Video that has subdus' (EY)
Moving the 'buttock' went viral
All e 'natural, with nothing to envy (AAH)

And without movies, he likes the real (ah-ah)
When they talk about her to 'the world in the mouth puts a latch (ey, ey)
Because nobody has a poison of her in the corillo (hehe; oh-oh)

Although a vece 'e' the most 'sought (Miky Woodz)

And you ere 'like the ghost' and that at night it is not seen
Playing a game that I already know
And I don't leave the house without a half of the
I climb on top and feel the glope
She sees me and says she loves
With me a devil, with you a holy
He says that he hardly smokes, he only does it with her friend
He is with me and getting up he gets up

[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
I know
Which are little 'what they have put', but they know it a lot (eh-eh)
She and like the moon, only goes night (eh-eh)
Which are little 'what they have put' but they know it a lot (eh-eh-eh)

Today he got pretty, he made his nail 'and hair
Premiered the new outfit
She sleeps with whoever wants
But not anyone can be his jevo

[Verse 3: Lenny Tavárez]
(Lenny Tavárez, Baby)
And he wiggles (he wiggles)
Every time I see it looks like a fireplace
Fumetea and Chingotea (Fumetea and Chingotea)
Bellaquita, not to 'the world disrupts her (no; ey)
Get over, get with my body (wooh)
Get over, don't waste your time
[Verse 4: Jay Wheeler]
And wherever she stands out
It dress fine, has high self -esteem (Oah)
He doesn't want to relate '
He left the jevo because he doesn't need (Yeah-Yeah)
And everyone loves her (everyone loves her)
But she says she stays alone
Dangerous like a gun
And by no man she cries

[Verse 5: Bryant Myers]
Yeh
Arca told me that it was the same Susana, that it was healthy
That was calm and reserved
With me and the opposite, evil
Asks me that the legs' open him
Some 'call it "devil" and another' "goddess"
You invited her to smoke and said she didn't do that 'thing'
But with me he burned an ounce
She has a thousand envious, but e 'because it is well powerful
The 'other' cannot measure strength
Even women 'know it's good
His face cheats, but e 'well perverse
He told you no, that she was not like that
But with me beautiful
They write a lot, but Pichea
He says that he can, borders
Call me after janguea
Anytime

[Chorus: Nio García]
I-I, I know
Which are little 'what they have put', but they know it much
She and like the moon, only goes out at night
Which are little 'what they have put' but they know it a lot

[Post-Coro: Nio García]
Today he got pretty, he made his nails and hair
Premiered the new outfit
She sleeps with whoever wants
But not anyone can be his jevo
