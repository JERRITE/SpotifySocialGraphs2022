Cut it that goes without Jockey Lyrics [letter of "cocala that goes without jockey" ft. Daddy Yankee]

[Saying: Daddy Yankee]
Yankee, put him with Candela, Yankee, put him with Candela
Put it with candela, so that the gyons move
Luny, put him with Candela, Luny, put him with Candela
Put it with candela, so that the gyons move

Yankee, put him with Candela, Yankee, put him with Candela
Put it with candela, so that the cats move
Luny, put him with Candela, Luny, put him with Candela
Put it with candela, so that the cats move
[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Take it that goes without jockey
The girl asks for reggaeton from that Disjockey (Luny Tunes)
Tell me, what pa'ó, Broki?
At tip 'and caramel are those catskis, outside
CoGella that goes without jockey
The girl asks for reggaeton from that Disjockey (Luny Tunes)
Tell me, what pa'ó, Broki?
Sazon Pall Sandungueon Pa 'Put them Loquis

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
Loquilla, in a corner I have Pillá ', ah
You have to polish to make her shine, ah
You are foal, I'm going to saddle you
I am guillar, then it is going to escavillá ', ah
Loquilla, in a corner I have Pillá ', ah
You have to polish to make her shine, ah
You are foal, I'm going to saddle you
I am guillar, then it is going to escavillá '

[Pre-car: Daddy Yankee]
Mommy, tell me if we take Algaretoski
(Tye I'm going without jockey)
Shut up in a corner you like to be a dogski
(Ah; Think that I'm going without jockey)
I'm without fear in the street, mommy, because I walk with the fuloskis
(Tye I'm going without jockey)
You are not afraid, I am not afraid, this is Fuegoski
(Tye I'm going without jockey)
What what?
