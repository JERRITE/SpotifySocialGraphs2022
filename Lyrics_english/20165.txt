‎deathwish Lyrics[Intro: Bonnie]
You make my head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win, I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish
(To a fucking deathwish)

[Verse 1: Bonnie]
I don't wanna suffer on the stupid things that you said
Why don't you dig the grave big enough for us? Yeah, yeah
Think I'm losing something that I didn't know I could have
I'll be drinking your sweat
'Til we're fucking dead, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Bonnie]
Kissing the knife
A cynical and miserable high
Can see the end of this in your eyes
If you're staying, could you quit saying, "Bye"?
Bye

[Chorus: Bonnie]
You make my head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win, I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish

[Verse 2: Joe, Bonnie]
Yo, if it's real, we say it out loud
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how
Evеry single night, every singlе fight
Now I feel like I was right when I left, but it's too late now
Yeah, yeah, ayy, I know this won't last, yeah
You're not in my bed, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
(We're not fucking dead yet) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Bonnie, Joe]
Kissing the knife
A cynical and miserable high (Hey, yeah)
Can see the end of this in your eyes
If you're staying, could you quit saying, "Bye"?
(Quit saying, "Bye") Bye

You make my head spin (Hey, hey)
God knows I can't win (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know what I'm doing (I don't know what I'm doing)
I think I got a fucking deathwish (Deathwish)
It's got me headsick (Headsick)
If I can't win, I'm losing (Oh)
To a fucking deathwish
Watch my fucking head spin
God knows I can't win (I can't win)
I don't know what I'm doing (I don't know what I'm doing)
I think I got a fucking deathwish (Deathwish)
It's got me headsick (It's got me headsick)
If I can't win, I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish

[Outro: Bonnie, Joe]
Said I'll drink your sweat
'Til we're dead, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
