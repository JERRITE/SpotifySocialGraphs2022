Ash kisses Lyricsalgo happens to me I can't sleep
I take your photo and throw me into the sofa
I'm going to break it
The air is leaving

In front of your home you told you
You cornered you forgot about me
I ran I could not resist

She is my friend and I don't care
You do not care about me
She is my friend the best
You went to look for her to talk about love
Breeze Soul Ash Kisses
Innocent eyes
Heart that lies
Like bandits you slide
Breeze Soul Ash Kisses
Innocent eyes
Heart that lies
All derrepent is trizas
Ash kisses
They were promises glass stories
Fragile your mooring way of me
I have seen everything
You can't lie to me
Nooo

She is my friend and I don't care
You do not care about me
She is my friend the best
You went to look for her to talk about love
Ash kisses
Breeze soul
Innocent eyes
Heart that lies
Like bandits you slide
Breeze Soul Ash Kisses
Innocent eyes
Heart that lies
All derrepent is trizas

Ash kisses
Breeze soul
Innocent eyes
Heart that lies
All derrepent is trizas
