Kawasaki Lyrics [Verse 1: Nik Tendo]
Million+ Rookie (Million)
Wookie shredded here
Cigo already knows (already knows it)
No one tells me anymore, into life
I do everything after my
I have to turn like a carousel
HOES, COKE, BLOW
Mustang goes through the darkness, ou, oou
Brothers with me dou, dou, dou
Somewhere for fun
[Verse 2: Yzomadias]
Svih (Posh)
I will come as a bitrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Jakube are you iceberry like brrr (glacier)
And deck is a doctor like a drrr
What do you still do so hrrr
Then you frown like grrr
Because your booza makes a mrrrk on me
And your rap is not even a joke, it's just a frrrk (yeah)
Give me gold on my teeth and my krrrk (give)
Give me vodka with soda, srrrk
I (what) du from the bottom to the top, ej
Mix me Spritz
Crucify me
I guess I'll buy a brick
I close the bitch into the cellar like a fritz
She scratched me like a grip
Drove away (where) drift
And those who hate me so rip (swing)
Give me peace
Give me a drink, sip, sip
Legend (how) Rich The Kid
And 21 my number like mig

[Verse 3: Nik Tendo]
Dominic
My nick, the nik tendo
Say put it out
I say my time comes, it goes out
My life is bonton
And Pondondon is a mentor

A new time probably here fucked like a ruin
And here Czech as a local
I'll give it myself I don't need the second vocal
Brother's bitch i have never hocked
I did not motivate for half a year
I fly like rogalo when I smell I can't resist
Broko I did not motivate for half a year
I fly like rogalo when I smell I can't resist

[Verse 5: Nik Tendo]
SOURS SAVE SAVE
The brain works, the processor
She is the beauty I am here monster
Girls to the collection, collector
I teach them to live life, lecturer
The world is bad, I will protect you - protector
I burn bounds, wizard
Hammer, lightning, thor

[Verse 6: Yzomandias]
I watch the block, my sector
Here commander like hektor
You don't understand that so
Give from Restore again
With cutting I will look like fester
When I want to kill you I think about how dexter
I'm not a test as in a tester perfumery
Million+ My Sme Best of
He did not see such a set
[Verse 7: Nik Tendo]
Violation of the rules, from that they are
What do I say you do here a preacher
Capo di tutti, spaghetti, gnocchi
Lazan on yourself as money
And the door open sou
You'd rather not follow me your HOE
It might happen that he will leave with me, ou

[Verse 8: Yzomandias]
SE MACHINE MONEY Two first letters SOU Low (bottom)
And not high, in balance is my goal (goal)
I hate long loading, you don't have balls like ox
And you are luggage as BagGage
I have cats like Felix

[Verse 9: Nik Tendo]
I guess I fell into it like Obelix
From the fire was born here with a phoenix
I am here to Slytherin's heir

[Verse 10: Yzomandias]
I have you read (how) Teletext
She has a girl is the best as Helena (Troy)
I have three hundred in my pocket as Leonidas
To two drinks and a gypsy
