Bombay Lyrics [song text for "Bombay"]

[Intro]
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Ohh
Kippe Bombay
Yes, yes, yes, yes, ohh

[Hook]
Kippe Bombay (Ah)
Kippe Bombay in my glass
Give the mix oj (ah)
Mix oj to my grass
Yes, I tie Bombay
Tips too much of the poison, I don't care
Give the mix oj
Who wants to say what? Man, I live as I want, yes
[Part 1]
Half of the blunt away
Killer in a mood, Dicka, killer in a mood, ey
Drug abuse
Hotel room with woman, digga, only on it, ey
¡Hola, Bonita!
Bring me to the gin the cohiba
Boss Boss Totò Riina
Kanaks are already putting their films
The blood pumps on adrenaline through the Ven'n
My artillery remains forever
Patte deserve to count them afterwards
Simple mathematics, Digga, no problem at all, yes
Fresh, like Airwaves
Take what you are entitled to do without fairness
You say: “Make yourself
Go ahead with your nose like a sword fish "

[Hook]
Kippe Bombay (Ah)
Kippe Bombay in my glass
Give the mix oj (ah)
Mix oj to my grass
Yes, I tie Bombay
Tips too much of the poison, I don't care
Give the mix oj
Who wants to say what? Man, I live as I want, yes
You might so like [Part 2]
We bale like LeBron James
And I tie the Bombay
When I come, roll the knoll'n haze
24/7, Dicka, All Day
Don't make an eye, Bro, we're on it from the dope
Still too high
Shots Pow-Pow-Pow, fall like Dominos
The Fam stands like a one
Raid 'in Prada-Bandana
Rock like Carlos Santana
Pasa Mi la Cubana y Fuego
Another bottle for my ego
Na na
Well na, uh

[Hook]
Kippe Bombay (Ah)
Kippe Bombay in my glass
Give the mix oj (ah)
Mix oj to my grass
Yes, I tie Bombay
Tips too much of the poison, I don't care
Give the mix oj
Who wants to say what? Man, I live as I want, yes
[Outro]
Vay Vay, Vay Vay, Vay Vay
Vay Vay, Vay Vay, Vay Vay8embed
