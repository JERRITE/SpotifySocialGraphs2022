Consent lyrics [letter of "consent"]

[Verse 1]
Forgive if tonight I have fantastic
But tomorrow I get up unfriendly
Forgive for not having an attic
For having done that you are very fast
Forgive, smoke from my critical
I can't be analytical
Forgive whether for music
I forgot that you were the only
Who understands me and does not encode me
My brain making popcorn
I disconnect and you, beautiful inrrites
Like life, I'm a Sibarita
With how beautiful you are
Do not snick like toas' women
Look, with how beautiful you are
Why don't we get together and do some babies?
[Chorus]
And caressed me from the front
You know that for you I would give
The saint that you would like
To your brother, if you want, would give it to him
I don't care to kill myself
So I carry life
I wouldn't mind getting away
But I don't want you to be a consent
A consent (Yalo Yale)
A consent (Yalo Yale)
A consent (Yalo Yale)
A consent (Yalo Yale)
A consent (Yalo Yale)

[Verse 2]
The accounts get erratic
When they have always left automatic
I don't know mathematics
She helps me, I have it on practices
The amount tells me
It calculates what I have to enter
What you have to buy
What you have to look for
Money knows how to bleach
She is with me, she is mine
When we were always decorating me
I have told him that I want two girls:
One Mi Manuela and another Rosalia
I do not trust me
I have told him that I am not a desire
That together let's start a life
Mommy, don't make you surprised
You Might Also Like [chorus]
And caressed me from the front
You know that for you I would give
The saint that you would like
To your brother, if you want, would give it to him
I don't care to kill myself
So I carry life
I wouldn't mind getting away
But I don't want you to be a consented '
