Komi (komi) lyrics [lyrics "Komi]

[Intro]
Leezey on da Fuckin 'Beat

[Verse 1: Soda Luv]
No need to repair what works
Soon you will understand this from your experience (yes)
I love the smell of this new shoes (Slatt)
I am high, but I remember the smell of soot
This is my path, from it is lost (Kysch)
A lot of cache, as if I won it in Lotty (Cash)
Your bitch is my Property, she spends your royalty
But she will not let you enter (ha ha, ha)
I will not fuck you (I'm sorry), I already drink bars (fuzetea)
In one joystick, poison (bush), Bitch, You Gonna Suck My Balls! (Pussy)
There are a lot of pearls on the arm - bead
From you, the stink is like in Foot Locker'ee
I don't need an offer anymore
Any clothing on me sits well, like on the opera
All the bitches are silent with you, as if you are on the opera (hut-sh)
Do you want a Merce, but you are on Opel'e.
Did you take weight? (PS-shu) So what now?
You took weight and we took it (Gang!)
PUFF - And I am in the seventh heaven from Doniki
Fuck what gopniks think
Bazaru what I want, I'm not afraid of the public
Bitch, I'm from the Komi Republic (Ukhta)
Pale, white as out of dusk
Nine millimeters-amulet (br-r, br-r, br-r, br-r)
Poor white, believes in the best
Blend-a-Med to brush her teeth
On the back in Uber, the poor white is already angry
I am like Hitchcock, and I have birds (Sheesh)
My boys from the province
We look like young princes
We are here to achieve everything
Pow, pow - you are lecho (vegetable)
Choppa came to meet with me (Slatt)
Tu-tu-tu, in the body of the buckshot
Broke Boy, I won't meet you anymore
Sit at home, eat buckwheat
The bitch ate CD-ROM, and now it has become easier (discs)
Fuck it all? There is no question of this (not)
I do not like to touch these usable things (yes)
[Verse 2: Bushido zho]
Pop-up
(Gang, Gang) Gang Gang
Pop (on)
Whole Lotta Bang, Whole Lotta Gang, Whole Lotta Move
Whole Lotta in the way, for
Evaluating my musical taste (Yeah)
He filled you up with Edlibs
After all, all your tracks we dumped (likely)
White like sugar, you were scattered
From time to time fell (e), e
We work at night, after (Hold on)
Lil 'nigga, we are gang, Hold on (Gang, Hold On)
Young Bushido Zho
At the guest desk of Bushido Zho
Pop-for-on-on-for
My crooked face, does not smooth the filter on Instagram
This is useless, I cook in everything
To help your mother (by)
If you want such a sound
Buy a svega with a friend, but equally
You can't take it into solo - expensive, you like a magpie
I wanted to say that expensive is expensive
Ahead - a large road
I'm like Tobirama Senju
To hell with a zitsu, because I love my family
What do you want to say, nigga, like I'm a wizard?
This is my book, Nigga!
I'm talking about "black clover", you do not understand, nigga
Your trap, I have not seen, you drew, nigga
You are harmful in the one, I call you a siga
I am like Seemee-dad, and I shot'l wigg (like gang)
E-e, I will not fan you (sorry), I love crab meat rude (Crusty)
Gang, Hold on, in our way, yryou might also like333mbed
