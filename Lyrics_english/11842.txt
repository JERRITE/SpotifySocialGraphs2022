The hypo Lyrics [lyrics by "the hiccup"]

[Intro: Danny Romero]
Look at the eyes that I don't know how to live, I don't know how to breathe without you
Girl, hold on to the hand for dancing that I don't even know how to walk without you
Strange things inside 'and my entrails'
And spider me

[Chorus: Juan Magán & Danny Romero]
It takes away the hypo-po-po (ay)
It has me crazy-co-co-co-co-co
A kiss knows me
Oh, give me another, another and another
Po-po-po-po
It is crazy-co-co-co-co (ay)
A kiss knows me
Oh give me another, another and another
[Verse 1: Danny Romero]
I see you and start the cold sweats' (EH)
I have the mind and tongue made a mess (OH-OH)
Like a poison in the body I put '
Baby, that 'Nalguitas have me submitted to me' (OH-OH-OH)
I am a zero if you leave, a millionaire when it is'
My Cora E 'as Mandela screaming at Freedom
Oh, girl, have mercy, leave me to provoke
That in that mouth I need to dive

[Chorus: Juan Magán & Danny Romero]
It takes away the hypo-po-po (ay)
It has me crazy-co-co-co-co-co
A kiss knows me
Oh, give me another, another and another
Po-po-po-po
It is crazy-co-co-co-co (ay)
A kiss knows me
Oh give me another, another and another

[Verse 2: Juan Magán]
Knows me little with you
Stroke your feet to the navel
If you promise me that you dance 'with me
I will stay for meaning, woh-yo-yo
Give me, give me lu ', if I don't give me a band
I know you liked it, I know that I am missing
And that you do not have 'na' of Santa
And suitor 'you don't miss
