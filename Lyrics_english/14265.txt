Do You Really Wanna Know? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve been overthinking all of my life
They’ll ask me up in Heaven why I fell on my knife
All of my emotions ain't technically right
But I don’t wanna go there and fuck up your night

[Pre-Chorus]
No, nothing’s wrong, I just want to take a walk
Feels like you ask me every time we talk

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?
Do you really wanna know
Who’s been messing with my health?
We could get into my head
Or just spend the day in bed
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?
[Verse 2]
I go out collecting all of my thoughts
They start to hit my head with such a violent force (Hey!)
All of my emotions, ain’t  technically right
But I don’t wanna go there and fuck up your night

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms, so I’ve got somewhere to hide
The world is ending, so take me for a ride

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?
Do you really wanna know
Who’s been messing with my health?
We could get into my head
Or just spend the day in bed
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?

[Bridge]
I was lost going round and round
Asked for the truth, look who I found
I was lost going round and round
Asked for the truth, look who I found
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?
Do you really wanna know
Who’s been messing with my health?
We could get into my head
Or just spend the day in bed
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?

Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?
Do you really wanna know
Who’s been messing with my health?
We could get into my head
Or just spend the day in bed
Do you really wanna know
What I’d change about myself?

[Outro]
Do you really wanna know? Do you really wanna know?
(Have we made it?)
All by ourselves
(Have we made it?)
Like everyone else
(Have we made it?)
All by ourselves
(Have we made it?)
Like everyone else
(Have we made it?)Embed
