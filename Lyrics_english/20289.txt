I’m Delighted Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been fighting with the voice inside my head
It's been telling me that I'm not good enough
Doesn't matter how loud I shout
It always seems to shout much louder
Conclusions that I didn't want to draw
And feelings that I tried to push aside
Want to break the silence, I've been
Shutting down my own emotions

[Chorus]
So let me tell the world I'm not okay
Knowing that I will be some day
Been walking with a face that's saying
I'm delighted, I'm delighted
I'm delighted
[Drop]
It seems I'm delighted, I'm delighted
(Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It seems I'm delighted, I'm delighted
I'm delighted

[Bridge]
(I'm delightеd)

[Verse 2]
'Cause I know now I'm not alone
In feeling like I am alonе
Yes, I know now I'm not alone
In feeling like I am alone
Alone, alone
Ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
So let me tell the world I'm not okay
Knowing that I will be some day
Been walking with a face that's saying
I'm delighted, I'm delighted
I'm delighted

[Drop]
It seems I'm delighted, I'm delighted
(Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(I'm delighted)
(Ah, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It seems I'm delighted, I'm delighted
I'm delightedYou might also likeEmbed
