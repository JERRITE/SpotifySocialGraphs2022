Come Clean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's go back, back to the beginning
Back to when the Earth, the Sun, the stars all aligned
'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle was no life
I defy

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean, oh
[Verse 2]
I'm shedding, shedding every color
Tryna find a pigment of truth beneath my skin, oh
'Cause different doesn't feel so different
And going out is better than always staying in
Feel the wind

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean (Let's go back, back to the beginning)

[Bridge]
(Rain fall down) I'm coming clean
(Rain fall down) Hey, yeah
(Rain fall down)
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall, I'm coming

[Chorus]
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean (Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams)
Oh, I'm coming clean (Let it wash away my sanity)
Oh, I'm coming clean ('Cause I wanna feel the thunder)
Let the rain fall, let the rain fall, let the rain fall
(I wanna scream, let the rain fall down)
I'm coming clean (Let the rain fall down)
