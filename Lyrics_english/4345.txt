Chevere Lyrics ["Chevere" letter]]

Murate taste is a pleasure lady, I'm Kevin Roldan
I came to invite your little daughter to take with me a whistle
(KR)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Kevin Roldan)

You are already mounted in my car
Talk to me clearly what are we going to do
If you want we are going for my house to drink
A little guarite
A tequila, your calm, calmadita
And the negligence
And push her towards my bed
(Kevin Roldan baby)
I want to tear that pajamas
Until early girl!
(Pull!)

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Imagine that alone
We exist and Yoo!

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Something Chevere Maa
Something Chevere Maa

This is the crib of kr
My house is your quiet house we are already alone
Tell me that you want to drink
A little guarite
Tell where you want it
Go baby in bed we started, we pocket
After the bathroom we shift
You Might Also Likesubile to Music
Turn on the Calient Jacuzzi (Calient)
To make you very rich (very rich)
GIVE KISS
Maybe a ratic

I'm going to turn a bareti ...

In my bedroom
There is a hidden camera
To record all why
That we did all day
Call a little friend Pa Jhail
If you ask what we are going to do here
You tell you that ...

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Imagine that alone
We exist and Yoo!

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Something Chevere Maa
Something Chevere Maa
I know that only in photos and videos you have seen me
And ready
I am the same
Kevin Roldan who comes out on TV if you want to pinch
I want to give that bootysito a bites
Take you for my house and give you
And ready
(PHART)

Forget who I am
Leave the panicoo
You want me to eliminate you
Tell me I get your pants
In the armchair of my truck
A fin tube
Let's smoke hierabite to leave the planet

Much is a pleasure lady I'm Kevin Roldaan
I came to invite your daughter to take with me a whistle

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(The Audi Yeah)

You are already mounted in my car
Talk to me clearly what are we going to do
If you want we are going for my house to drink
A little guarite
A tequila, your calm, calmadita

And the negligence
And push her towards my bed
I want to tear that pajamas
Until early girl!

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Imagine that alone
We exist and Yoo!

Let's do something Chevere
Shorty Damelo Shorty move
Loose the booty ...
Something Chevere
Something Chevere Maa
Something Chevere Maaembed
