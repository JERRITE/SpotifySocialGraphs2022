La La Lainey Lyrics[Intro]
She was into hardcore, I was into rock and roll
She was into girls, it was her own form of birth control
She was smoking cigarettes and drinking before five
She was wild, she was fine with being hungover all the time
Come on

[Verse 1]
She was always at a party, disappointing daddy
Always dating dirtbags, everyone but me she had
Lyrics from her favorite song tattooed on her arm
She was rough, she was fine, she was way out of her mind
[Chorus]
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like hate, I love her like pain
I need her like a picnic needs the rain
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
She loved drinking whiskey, first thing in the morning
She would start a fight if you looked at her the wrong way
Every day was Halloween a reason to rebel
She was wild, she was fine with being bitter all the time

[Chorus]
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like hate, I love her like pain
I need her like a picnic needs the rain
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
She was smoking cigarettes and drinking before five
She was wild, she was fine with being hungover (Over, over)

I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I love her like hate, I love her like pain
I need her like a forest needs a flame
I love her like rage, I love her like shame
I need her like a victim needs the plague
I love her like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la3Embed
