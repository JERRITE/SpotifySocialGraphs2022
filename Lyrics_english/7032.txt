Come Over Lyrics[Intro: Jorja Smith]
Tell me what I did this time
Why is it I work so hard for you?
I wish I could read your mind
(I don't know if you want me to come over)

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask, really I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask, really, I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
This is something that I'm used to
I give too much but I choose to and you love that
Yeah, you love that
I don't know what you have been through
But I worked too hard now to lose you and you know that
Yeah, you know that

[Bridge]
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
(Mi a call fi you gyal, but you nah answer mi)
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
(Mi a call fi you gyal, but you nah answer mi)

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
Wish I knew what's on your mind
Then I wouldn't think it's something I've done, oh
If you gave more of your time, yeah, we both might just get what we want
Are you too scared to love me?

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Tell me what I did this time
Why is it I work so hard for you?
I wish I could read your mind
(I don't know if you want me to come over)

I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask, really I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Yuh d'even, yuh d'even, yuh d'even know that)
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask (Trouble!), really, I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)

[Verse 3: Popcaan]
You should, you would know
Marry you like Bruno Mars
Late night FaceTime call
Cyan work at di studio
It's been a while mi see you whine
It's been a while you smile
Yuh getting prettier, yuh pretty from you a juvenile
Whine up yuh body gyal, yuh fit, can go ah couple mile
You have a bad attitude, sometime you act recoil

[Verse 1: Jorja Smith & Popcaan]
This is something that I'm used to (Weh!)
I give too much but I choose to (Trouble!), and you love that
Yeah, you love that
I don't know what you have been through
But I worked too hard not to lose you, and you know that
Yeah, you know that
[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask, really I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
I don't know if you want me to come over
Don't wanna ask, really, I should know better
I don't know if you want me to come over
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)

[Outro]
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
(Mi a call fi you gyal, but you nah answer mi)
(Hot body gyal, gyal ah whine up pon mi)
(Mi a call fi you gyal, but you nah answer mi)6Embed
