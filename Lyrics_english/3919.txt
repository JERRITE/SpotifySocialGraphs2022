You are mine LyricsThere is no words to show you how
No song that's come from David's crown
I could take my sole and pour it out
At your feet, but I'll wait patiently, for you

Oh I will, forever and always
Put you before me, to the end of time
But until then, 'til my last breath rolls in
Oh I am yours and you are mine

My heart beats for you alone
No house can hold the love that we own
Everytime you fall from grace to your knees
I'll wait patiently, for you
Oh I will, forever and always
Put you before me, to the end of time
But until then, 'til my last breath rolls in
Oh I am yours and you are mine

Oh someday we'll see
What forever means
My love

Oh someday we'll see
What forever means
My love

Oh someday we'll see
What forever means
My love

Oh someday we'll see
What forever means
My love

Oh I will, forever and always
Put you before me, to the end of time
But until then, 'til my last breath rolls in
Oh I am yours and you are mine
Oh I am yours and you are mineYou might also likeEmbed
