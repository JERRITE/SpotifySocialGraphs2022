Something About You Lyrics[Chorus: Eyedress]
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh

[Verse 1: Eyedress]
Leave the car at the valet (Cash only)
Check me in, pop the champagne (Dom Perignon)
Pour me a glass, she's got good taste (So good)
Take off our clothes by the fire place (Sexy, yeah)
She looks just like a dream
The prettiest girl I've ever seen
From the cover of a magazine
[Chorus: Eyedress]
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh

[Verse 2: Dent May]
We stayed up all night and slept 'til noon
It's so nice to wake up next to you
Let's start the day with breakfast in bed
Think I'm gonna love you 'til I'm dead
I can't wait to buy you things
A brand new diamond ring
This is more than just a fling

[Chorus: Eyedress]
In the car, cruising around with you
And my baby, you know that I got you
Hit the road, I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry, there's something about you, oh
There's something about you, girl
There's something about you, oh
Something about you
