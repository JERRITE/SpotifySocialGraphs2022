EH-EH, EH-EH

[Chorus: Yandel]
Explain what you feel when you're naked (Woh, Oh, Oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart (Yeah, EH)
The bed begins and will be naked (Oh; Oh)
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
Explain what you feel when you're naked
Tell him only with me the heart naked
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
[Verse 1: cosculluela]
Yeah, Yeah
Tell him that I am your jay z, and that you ere 'my beyonce (yah)
That when I do it 'in the car
E 'from Humacao to Ponce
Despacito as Fonsi (hahaha)
In La Mercedes throughout the Monce
Explain that while I handle you throwing fire in the B11, uh (brr; brr!)
I set up 'a creepy and smoke' from night until the sun alums us
That if I am traveling, you touch yourself so as not to lose the habit (Wuh)
To listen to me, there it rains (hahahaha)
Mommy, I know that I drink it for me '
You tell what I lie down (prr, prr)
Most never move (Buh)
Tell him that for me you have the closet
Full of clothes, shoe 'and wallet' (chá-chá-chá-chá)
That sometimes I catch you and let you get away
Carolina Herrera suit (Oh shit)
Explain that I have control
But I do it 'in your own way (baby)
I fulfilled your fantasies, and you fulfilled mine '
Above the carpet with panther skin (BRR; BRRA!)

[Chorus: Yandel]
Explain what you feel when you're naked (huh, eh; oh, oh)
Tell him only with me the heart naked
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you (eh)
Explain what you feel when you're naked (Woh, Oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart (Yeah, EH)
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you

To see if one day you return 'to your home (I don't think)

And that he takes you by roof (aha)
And tell him that he now ended in love

Speak 'Of course, he knows us' (ha ha)
Nobody was suddenly what he does'
The vibes between you and me and an eruption volcano
It is common and never disconnected ', Yeah-Yeah (Wuh)
If being with you is a crime
That arrest me, I do not take away (wuh)
And they give me the death penalty

And with my mouth I make it back (auh)

That he who was before me already fell (ha ha)
Because I make you get 'listening to my voice' (guh, huh)
