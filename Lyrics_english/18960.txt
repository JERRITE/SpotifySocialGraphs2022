Dance of the Dead Lyrics[Intro: Richard Rogers]
I've broken my bones, suffered endlessly for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down, I hope you'll catch me soon
I hope you'll catch me soon

[Verse: Richard Rogers, Aaron Melzer; both]
Attention to love, to life, to all that's right
I'm wondering why you're letting me fall so far
From what I've chased my entire life
Through the darkest of nights, with no hope for a light
I bled for you (I bled for you)
When you were broken, alone and you needed me most
I bled for you (I bled for you)
So, please, give me one good reason
I should keep believing in a goddamn thing
When this thing inside of me, clawing at my seams
It's telling me to give up, move on and forget my life
But in the end you'll see
This is the difference between you and me
[Chorus: Richard Rogers]
I've broken my bones, suffered endlessly for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down, I hope you'll catch me soon
But you're not coming
I've broken my bones, suffered endlessly for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down, I hope you'll catch me soon
I hope you'll catch me soon

[Refrain: Richard Rogers]
Should I suffer now?
Should I suffer now?

[Breakdown: Aaron Meltzer, Richard Rogers]
I'll carry on, through the bitter days
I'll carry on, through this hell you face
I try to stand tall, I try to stand tall
But it's so hard to live when it means nothing at all
It's never enough, should I give up now?
It's never enough, I shouldn't give up now
Would you draw me a line? I'll carry on, carry on
Could you draw me a line? I'll carry on, carry on

[Chorus: Richard Rogers]
I've broken my bones, suffered endlessly for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down, I hope you'll catch me soon
But you're not coming
I've broken my bones, suffered endlessly for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down, I hope you'll catch me soon
I hope you'll catch me soon

(We struggle at best, but keep wanting more)
(You can't reach the top without feeling the floor)
We struggle at best, but keep wanting more
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor
I've broken my bones, threw my seams out the door
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor, fuck!
You can't reach the top, you can't reach the top
You can't reach the top without feeling the floorEmbed
