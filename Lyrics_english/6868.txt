Suicide Letter 3 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whoever knew I’d ever end up like this
All these drugs inside my system, numb the pain on my wrist
Yeah, the winter coming days are colder, times are getting shorter Bitch I’m twenty-one my dreams are fading cause I’m getting older
Oh shit, I think I’m running out of time now
I wish I knew how it felt, to make you mine now
I’m dreaming with a broken heart, but waking up the hardest part, so Imma take these fucking xans until my heart falls apart
You not in lovе until you take your own life, I slit my wrist, and then shе left me with a heart full of ice
Ooh, I’m kinda happy that we didn’t work out, but
Bitch I’m depressed because I’m stuck in my house
My nigga Victor, he gave his fucking shorty all he had, he left his friends and got a job because she made my friend a dad
I’m not goin tell your business, Vick I love you like a brother, but we both know your shorty brought you hell in the summer
That’s on my soul
[Verse 2]
Loves a myth, I’m only telling two stories
I keep my secrets to myself because you don’t have to worry
You hold her tight so she can bathe me in tears, she broke your heart and only left you in fear
I’m not a saint or a demon, I guess I’m something in between but when I say depressing lyrics, hoe you know just what I mean
Don’t follow in my footsteps, strongest might not be the smartest, I’ll fucking go to hell before she treat you like garbage
Loves a movie, this a page out my chapter
I lost my faith in fucking god I start ignoring my pastor, the devil watching and talking, hear him talk while I speak
He turn my dreams into nightmares so I try hard not to sleep
I’m depressed I’m upset, my eyes red I’m possessed
Cancer sticks in my ashtray bitch I want death nothing less
Life ain’t fair love is pointless so I just drown in my sorrow and I ain’t ever get you back just like the clothes that you borrow
My nigga Eli lost his life, my nigga Jaysoh lost his mind, your ex bitch used you she doesn’t need you, hope you feel it in your spine
You ain’t stupid you ain’t dumb, take your drugs and just some wine She don’t want you, she just need you, bruh I love you I ain’t lying
The past is the past, I hope you’re forgiving
The walls are really getting closer in the room that I’m sitting
But Imma hold you down like ankles weights the way I’m gonna make away
We go'n get rich and move up out of state
That’s on my soulYou might also likeEmbed
