Two Piece LyricsOne Two, One Two
[X2]

Lately things is seeming kinda crazy
All around, but I still take care of my baby
I gave her all of the right neccessities
She's always governin me
(Cus that's what's up)

We ain't gotta worry bout nothin (When we together)
We always handle our business (yeah-ee-yeah)
Just like a handing love
We fit great together
No need for anything extra
One Two, One Two (x2)
Don't add to this equation

One Two, One Two (x2)
There's no need for overthinkin

I don't need that (x2)
You don't need that (x2)
All we ever need
Is you and me
Like a two piece (x2)

I like nice things
And you like nice things
But we don't need them
To be happy yeah
Keep it simple baby
You and me
Are just
Like a two piece (x2)

We are the perfect combination
Like a new fitting-em
Like matching shoe laces
We set this whole outfit off
How we rockin makes people want to be
Like us like us
You know my style and I know used to
Two number ones equals to
I'm gonna stick with you
