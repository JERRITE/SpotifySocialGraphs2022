Psychotic Break Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel the fear take hold
Reside in darkness, thrive where most won't go
Adrift, I curse this gift
And hope you'll never know

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Snapping two by fours
Punching holes in dry wall
[Chorus 2]
Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Chalking up my dead friends
And loved ones long gone

[Verse 2]
I feel the fear take hold
Reside in darkness, thrive where most won't go
Adrift, I curse my gift
And hope you never know

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Snapping two by fours
Punching holes in dry wall

[Outro]
Feel like a psychotic break comin' on
Thinking 'bout my dead friends
Whose voices ring onYou might also likeEmbed
