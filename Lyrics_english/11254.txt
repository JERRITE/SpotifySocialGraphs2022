Our Love Will Still Be There LyricsI believe that in years to come
When the mountains have crumbled to dust
And all the oceans have all run dry
And the cars in the street turn to rust

Our love will still be there
Our love will still be there

When the rain from the sky don't fall
And the stars they don't shine at night
When all the nations have made their wars
And the soldiers have all had their fight
Our love will still be there
Our love will still be there

I'll always love you
No matter what comes in our path
I'll always need you
Like I have done in the past
I'll always be there
In your ups and in your downs
I'll even love you if the world stops going 'round

So when the days and the nights are joined
And the baby does no longer cry
When man has been to the ocean depth
And reached out his arms for the sky

Our love will still be there
Our love will still be there

I'll always love you
No matter what comes in our path
I'll always need you
Like I have done in the past
I'll always be there
In your ups and in your downs
I'll even love you if the world stops going 'round
You might also likeSo when the days and the nights are joined
And a baby does no longer cry
When man has been to the ocean depths
And reached out his arms for the sky

Our love will still be there
Our love will still be there
Our love will still be there
Our love will still be thereEmbed
