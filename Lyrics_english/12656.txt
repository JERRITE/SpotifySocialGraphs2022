All Of The Drugs Lyrics[Verse 1]
All of the drugs, she takes at night
Keep her awake, give me a fright
I don't know what goes through her mind
When she takes drugs
All of the lies she tells herself
Won't be believed by anybody else
And I can't buy just what she sells
When she tells lies

[Chorus]
And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word
But I still act sur-, surprised
[Verse 2]
Every kiss she gives away, might be a good time
But you know, the sad thing is the boys all say
She's something of a slut

[Chorus]
And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word
But I still act surprisedYou might also like6Embed
