Again Lila Lyrics [lyrics for "again Lila"]

[Pre-Hook: Samra]
Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again

[Hook: Samra]
Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again
[Part 1: Samra]
The dirt bull stops me, I haven't stolen anything
Plan an escape over Holland or Pol'n
I have alcohol in my blood, in the Levi's about sixty millions
And the police officer only lets me the last tilt
I boot 'antisocial, the voice, she is rough
Nose broken again, eyes purple, green and blue
Out the delivery van, balls are already in the run
Wallah, I'm going over corpses, but never back in the building, rrah
Milan's jogging suit
Lila in our pocket and we roll in the projector
Customers call and I have to supply them
True brothers fall, Lebanon, Ukraina - Rrah, Rrah!
Hundred grams of hashops in the pocket
But can't smoke, I'm just coming from prophylaxis
It smells of Olympéa Paco Rabanne
If I pay at the cash register in cash with Catalea at the cash register '

[Pre-Hook: Samra]
Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again

[Hook: Samra]
Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again
You Might So Like [Part 2: Capital Bra]
The tax office and the mafia (mafia) hunt me
But actually it's the same thing
Another use of the SEK (SEK)
All the wankers want to go to our notes (Brra)
Black Jack, horse names, Black Express American
IPhone-Handycam, Lamborghini Huracán
I like comfort, Gucci, Louis, Tom Ford
But can't sleep because the SEK comes too often
Distribute the stuff in the settlement
Meet me with the customers before the car rental
The suit is from Chelsea, Bratan, you see us (Bratan)
And get deep breath
He thinks he can play eggs because he has body (ah)
But I have 'Makarow as my bodyguard (yes)
Russian special unit grabs me in Stalingrad (where)
Because you think this Ukro is an oligarch (le le le, le le le)

Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again

[Hook: Samra]
Large families and the LKA hunt me
We are stars, but tick like dealers
Boards in the Camaro with 300 km/h
Capi, Samra count purple again
