[Verse 1]
I thought I died again in my dream (baby, I almost died)
Fighting for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm falling deep (oh, oh)
Without you I can't sleep (falling)
Because my heart belongs to you
I will risk everything for you
I love you by my side
This time I will never leave
I want us to have babies
We will not need protection
Your body next to mine
It's just a memory
I'm falling very deep, oh
Without you I can't sleep
Calmas the insomnia, oh
Tell me, because without you I can't breathe
[Verse 2]
In my darker hours
Baby, I felt only in this room full of people
Different girls on the floor, helping me to distract me from you
I became the man who used to be, who used to be
I forced myself to sleep
To in my dreams to be able to approach you
I didn't want to wake up unless you were next to me
I just wanted to call you and tell you, and tell you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I would give everything I have to hug you
I'm sorry to have broken your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
I never really arrived, uh
I was escaping reality, uh
Losing my time, making my fantasies come true
Spending money to compensate, to compensate
Because I need you, baby, uh
I will be in paradise when I am inside you
It was definitely a blessing to awaken by your side
I will never disappoint you again, again

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I would give everything I have to hug you
I'm sorry to have broken your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I will treat you better than before
I will hug you strong and I will never let you go
This time I will not break your heart, your heart, yes

[Bridge]
I know this is my fault
I let your guard down
I know I made you fall
Then I said that you were not the indicated
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (you)
I can't hide the truth, I stayed with her still thinking about you
You did things you regret
I would still risk for you
Because this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my love
Where are you now when I need you most?
I would give everything I have to hug you
I'm sorry to have broken your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I will treat you better than before
I will hug you strong and I will never let you go
This time I will not break your heart, your heart, no1embed
