Losing My Religion (Cover) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger, bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

[Verse 2]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
But I don't know if I can do it, do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
Just a dream

[Verse 3]
Every whisper, every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

[Verse 4]
Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me to my knees
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said, too much
You might also like[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream, just a dream
Dream
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

[Verse 2]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
I'm losing my religion
Trying to keep an eye on you
Oh, I don't know if I can do it, do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Outro]
But that was just a dream
Why do you try?
Why do you try?
'Cause that was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
