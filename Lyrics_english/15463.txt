[Verse 1: RVFV]
And huh, tonight I'm leaving the street to fuck
I already realized that you don't want to see me
What a bad time in you fell in love
But then don't look for me when you want to come back
Because we are no longer for yesterday
I knew you weren't a good woman
Now your friends are talking to the cell
I don't want to you, I don't want to know
[Chorus 1: Keen Levy]
And I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them
And I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them

[Pre-stribe 2: RVFV]
And now I'm going to enjoy my life
Don't call me anymore, I don't believe in your lies
You knew how much I loved you
I was for you, you in a fantasy world

[Chorus 2: RVFV]
Mommy, I'm not easy anymore
I don't want your kisses, don't tell me "dad"
I'm no longer imprisoned, now I'm Happy
You crazy about, I crazy about money, mommy
Mommy, mommy, I'm not easy anymore
I don't want your kisses, don't tell me "dad"
I'm no longer imprisoned, now I'm Happy
You crazy about, I crazy about money, mommy

And I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them
And I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them

[Verse 2: RVFV]
Go from my side that I don't want to see you anymore
Now look for the life that I already have another woman
You were bad, you used me and you screwed me
Look how then you came back and you regret
Bad, bad and brown
It has a heart that steals from anyone
I don't want your kisses, I don't want you to love me
I want you to go very far from my vera

[Bridge: Keen Levy]
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
The heart hurts
Damn pain
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
The heart hurts
Damn pain
[Pre-stribe 2: RVFV]
And now I'm going to enjoy my life
Don't call me anymore, I don't believe in your lies
You knew how much I loved you
I was for you, you in a fantasy world

[Chorus 2: RVFV]
Mommy, I'm not easy anymore
I don't want your kisses, don't tell me "dad"
I'm no longer imprisoned, now I'm Happy
You crazy about, I crazy about money, mommy
Mommy, mommy, I'm not easy anymore
I don't want your kisses, don't tell me "dad"
I'm no longer imprisoned, now I'm Happy
You crazy about, I crazy about money, mommy

[Chorus 1: Keen Levy & Rvfv]
And I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them
I don't want to see you anymore
Get out of my life
Leave lies
And I believed them
