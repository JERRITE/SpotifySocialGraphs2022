P*$$Y Fairy (OTW) [V-Mix] Lyrics[Intro]
(Yeah)
It's VEDO baby
(Level up)

[Verse 1]
You know I love fucking you (Yeah)
'Cause I stroke with intentions
Bet I, make you remember baby
How I made you cum for me, yeah
Well I guess it's looking like you're stuck with me
[Refrain]
This dick got you unfollowing exes
Double texting
Know that you're invested
The way you bless it
Damn, you make it so hard
Bet I make your soul talk
I'm gon' make you so damn proud
Girl, that pussy is a blessing
Know I won't neglect it
Make you wanna change your name
Shawty, this dick is a weapon
Hennessy ain't helpin'
Promise it won't feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I can be good or bad
Put my thumb in your ****
I'm taking it slow you're, making it grow, girl
I won't, let you down, down

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised, you know I'm freaky (Freaky)
Them double-hand motions, you gon' get a surprise
You way too fine, just for a quickie (Quickie)
So when I go down, I gotta take my time
You might also like[Refrain]
Now you're unfollowing exes
Asking who I'm texting
Your feminine hygiene
You know you excite me
I still smell your scent on my top lip
So when I say your name, that pussy speaks to my mind still

[Verse 2]
Girl it's my pleasure
Bringing you pleasure
Do it wherever
Kiss it however
Who do it better?
You gon' tat my name on it
I'ma put my claim on it
Well, I guess it's looking like you're stuck with me

[Refrain]
This dick got you unfollowing exes
And double texting
You're invested
The way you bless it
Damn, you make it so hard
Bet I make your soul talk
I'm gon' make you so damn proud
Girl, that pussy is a blessing (Oh)
Know I won't neglect it
Make you wanna change your name (Change your name)
Shawty, this dick is a weapon
Hennessy ain't helpin'
Promise it won't feel the same
[Pre-Chorus]
I can be good or bad
Put my thumb in your ****
I'm taking it slow you're, making it grow, girl
I won't, let you down, down

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised, you know I'm freaky (Freaky)
Them double-hand motions, you gon' get a surprise
You way too fine, just for a quickie (Quickie)
So when I go down, I gotta take my time

[Outro]
Now you're unfollowing exes
Stressing (Stressing)
Baby it's all yours, I'm invested
