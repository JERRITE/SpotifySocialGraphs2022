 Miscellaneous 
 Pope of Fools 
 Quasimodo 
 Young girls 
 You won't make fun of 
 When you see in the street 
 Quasimodo le hunchback 
 They read me 
 Pope of Fools 
 It is today the day of the FTE of Kings 
 And for one day it gives me all the rights 
 I love you 
 Esmeralda? 
 I love you? 
 But you don't care 
 Esmeralda 
 Oh! You do not care 
 That he read me 
 Pope of Fools 
 Young girls 
 Who are rciting rounds 
 By mimicking quasimodo 
 With his bump on the back 
 What did you do 
 That I am so ugly? 
 I hate the woman and the man who gave me the day 
 And abandoned me without giving me love 
 I love you 
 Esmeralda? 
 I love you? 
 But you don't care 
 Esmeralda 
 Oh! You do not care 
 That he read me 
 Pope of Fools 
 Pope of Fools

 Frollo advances to Quasimodo and tears off his tiara
