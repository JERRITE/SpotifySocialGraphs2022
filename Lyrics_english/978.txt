He got tired of being hidden
That was time, ah

Grab your hand around
And regardless of what they are going to say
[Chorus: Alex Rose & Lyanno]
Vamo 'to make it public
Come, kiss me in public
The thing about us is unique
Pichea, forget about to 'and
Vamo 'to make it public
Come, Kiss me public (OH-OH)

The one that likes when I post something (something)
Life is sweet but for another 'bitter
