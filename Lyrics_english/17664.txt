Moody Lyrics[Intro]
Look
Old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this (I bet you already knew this)
Look (Look), look (Look)
Look (Look), look (Look, Great John on the beat, by the way)

[Chorus]
My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody (Don't fuck around, we get moody)
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in directions like we making movies, look
[Verse]
Is you retarded?
This a function, not a party
I'm bustin' my moves, uh (Moves)
Don't get me started
We be finishing our problems
They know how we move, look (Move)
We get it lit, huh
Chopper bustin', they gon dip, huh
They get snatched and watch 'em six, huh
They get hit and watch 'em tell, huh, look
Run and tellin' 12
2012, name been ringing like bells
'90s baby, I was probably like twelve, look
Do a hit by myself
Ain't no college, I read books in the cell, look
Had to learn on my own
Couldn't teach me, felt like I already know
Felt like I already know, look, look

[Chorus]
My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in directions like we making movies, look
My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in directions like we making movies, lookYou might also like1Embed
