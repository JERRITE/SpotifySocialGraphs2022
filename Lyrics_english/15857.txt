I came to look for Lyricsletra from "I came to look for you"
[Verse 1]
I've never said you stay
For fear that you go, oh ay ay
You left and now I understand
What shut up does not lead to anything, oh ay ay

[Pre Coro]
And on the roof of my soul I have a hole where the rain enters
And the soul gets wet
Few things scare me and one of them is losing the light
Of your gaze
[Chorus]
I came to look for you why I dream of you
And I don't think to forget this time
I'm going to tie my sailboat to your mouth
And until you go crazy I will do it
I'm going to rain on your wet skin

[Verse 2]
There is a return map
Just follow the signs, oh ay ay
There is no love that is perfect
And affection is what is worth, ay ay ay

[Pre Coro]
And on the roof of my soul I have a hole where the rain enters
And the soul gets wet
Few things scare me and one of them is losing the light
Of your gaze

[Chorus]
I came to look for you why I dream of you
And I don't think to forget this time
I'm going to tie my sailboat to your mouth
And until you go crazy I will do it
I'm going to rain on your wet skin

Only you
And only me
We know what the river is dragging
And I just want you to understand why I love you so much
I love you so

[Chorus]
I came to look for you why I dream of you
And I don't think to forget this time
I'm going to tie my sailboat to your mouth
And until you go crazy I will do it

[Chorus]
I came to look for you, unpredictable as April rain
And so you slowly reached me
I have you
I'm going to tie myself, but promises I plan to meet
If you swear to me
I dream about you
I came to look for you, unpredictable as April rain
And so slowly you got to me
I have you
And next to me you will live
I'm going to tie myself, but promises I plan to meet
If you swear to me
I dream about you
I have loved you for a long time
[Chorus]
I came to look for you why I dream of you
And I don't think to forget this time
I'm going to tie my sailboat to your mouth
And until you go crazy I will do it
I'm going to rain on your wet skin1embed
