TranslationsEspañolGo Outside Lyrics[Intro: Jim Jones]
"But to me, death is not… death is not a fearful thing, it's living that's treachery."
"Don’t be afraid to die. If these people land out here, they'll, they’ll torture some of our children here. They’ll torture our people. They’ll torture our seniors. We cannot have this."

[Verse 1]
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and make it light all day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and not care where you lay
[Bridge]
Well, I know what's good
Exactly 'cause I have been there before
Yeah, I know what's good
Exactly those things night cannot behold

[Verse 2]
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I think it's good to go out
'Cause if you don't you'll never make a memory that will stay
I, I think that we should break up
I think I want to live my life and you're just in my wayYou might also like3Embed
