Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me LyricsJanet:
I was feeling done in, couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before
Clumbia:
You mean she

Magenta:
Uhu

Janet:
I thought theres no use getting, into heavy petting
It only leads to trouble and, seat wetting
Now all I want to know, is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more (more, more, more)
I'll put up no resistance, I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch, I need assistance
Chorus:
Toucha, toucha, toucha, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fullfill me
Creature of the night

Janet:
Then if anything grows, while you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down (down, down, down)
And thats just one small fraction, of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand, oh i need action

Chorus
