Hold Back The Night Lyrics[Chorus]
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)

[Verse 1]
When you left you took the sun right out of the sky, yes, you did
Wondered why you went away and never told me why
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
[Chorus]
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)

[Verse 2]
Loneliness haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book that I have read
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

[Refrain]
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

[Chorus]
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby (Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby

[Refrain]
When the sun goes down, the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby (I don't wanna dream)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights (No, no)
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby (No more, no more, no more, I don't wanna dream)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream, dream about you, baby (No more, no more, no more, baby, bye-bye)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights (So long, so long)Embed
