.weighted. Lyrics[Verse 1]
If we wait
It might be too late
We'll make everybody cry
We wouldn't even have to try
If we stay
We may over stay
Our allotted time
And it just wouldn't feel right

[Pre-Chorus]
But I only speak the truth
And I'll always bleed for you
[Chorus]
So let's laugh
Let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
Let's love
Let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do

[Verse 2]
If I try
I might have to try
My entire life
And that just doesn't feel right
But If I fall
Flat on my face
Then let my bones break
Under my own weight

[Pre-Chorus]
But I only want the truth
That's one thing you can't do

[Chorus]
So let's laugh
Let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
Let's love
Let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do

Sometimes when the world goes round
Some things just don't change
Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old
Sometimes when the world goes round
Some things just don't change
Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old

[Verse 3]
If we wait
It might be to late
We'll make everybody cry
We wouldn't even have to try
I understand
Why you couldn't stand
Another day
Just standing in your way

[Chorus]
So let's laugh
Let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
Let's love
Let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do
[Outro]
Let's laugh (Sometimes when the world goes round)
Let's laugh (Sometimes when the world goes round)
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
(Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old)
Let's love (Sometimes when the world goes round)
Let's love (Sometimes when the world goes round)
Let's hate what our love makes us do
(Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old)
Let's hate what our love makes us do
(Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old)
And I love what my hate makes me do
(Sometimes it leaves me feelin' old)18Embed
