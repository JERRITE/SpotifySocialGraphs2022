Good People Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's hard to pray
Sometimes it's hard to stay grateful
It's painful, hurts so bad
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Gets hard to keep goin'
We keep holdin' on to what could have been

[Hook]
But we'll get by
We'll see the light
In the morning
It's gonna be alright
The circumstance
Is in the plan
Even if we don't fully understand
Why the bad things happen to the good people
[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to pray
I know sometimes it's hard to be patient
Ooh I hate it
Yeah it hurts so bad
Sometimes it's hard to believe
So hard to keep goin'
We keep holdin' on to what could have been

[Verse 3: Yazz]
So much pain
It’s still a lesson
Sometimes it rains
It’s still a blessing
You never see the silver lining
In the cloud
And so you doubt it
You never know how much you truly have
Until you go without it
One day its gonna turn into another season
Your gonna see that
All your tragedy
You had was for another reason
Its just a temporary goodbye
So ya gotta keep ya head high
The rain is coming down and its pouring
But joy is gonna come inside the morning

But we’ll get by
(Bye)
We’ll see the light
(Yeah)
In the morning its gonna be alright
(It’s gon be ok baby)
The circumstance
(The lord got ya)
Is in the plan
(And I gotcha)
Even if we don’t fully understand
Why the bad things
Happen to the good people1Embed
