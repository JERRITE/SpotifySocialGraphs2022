SHE CAN DANCE (Brabo Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Betty Who]
Standing in the doorway of my empty childhood room
Wearing a shirt I've had since I was seventeen (I was seventeen)
I can see her curly hair and posters on the wall
And when I check the mirror, I see her in me (I see her in me)

[Pre-Chorus: Betty Who]
Always late and always loud
Couldn't seem to figure out a way
To be enough for them to notice (Notice)
Second choice and second best
Couldn't say the things she meant
Or find the missing pieces that were broken
[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]
But she can dance, dance, dance
Even when it's raining
When the sky is falling down
Yeah, she can dance, dance, dance
With no music playing
Like nobody's watching now
Yeah, she can dance
She can dance
Dance
Now she can dance
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Betty Who]
I've seen bathrooms bigger than my old fourth floor apartment
Where I lived the year that I dropped out of school (I dropped out of school)
Seven dollar coffees and the romance of the city
Where you think you won't get hurt until you do (Hurt until you do)

[Pre-Chorus: Betty Who]
Always tall and always proud
Couldn't seem to figure out a way
To keep the ones she loved from leaving (Leaving)
Little drunk, a little numb
Couldn't sleep without the hum of taxi cabs
To drown what she was feeling
You might also like[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]
But she can dance, dance, dance
Even when it's raining
When the sky is falling down
Yeah, she can dance, dance, dance
With no music playing
Like nobody's watching now
Yeah, she can dance
She can dance
Dance
Now she can dance

[Bridge: Pabllo Vittar]
Hi, DJ
You already know, I can dance
I'm fierce enough
I'm just feeling the fantasy

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]
But she can dance, dance, dance
Even when it's raining
When the sky is falling down
Yeah, she can dance, dance, dance
With no music playing
Like nobody's watching now
Yeah, she can dance
She can dance
Dance
Now she can dance
Oh, ohEmbed
