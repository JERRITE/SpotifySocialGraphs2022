[Intro]
Icon!

[Bridge: Christopher]
When you look at me like that
You don't know what I would do to you
A little here
A touch there
You would forget about the world
[Pre-Caro: Joel]
Don't keep it mommy
What do you want if you distrust?
Tonight
You give it to me
You take out the lottery

[Chorus: Zabdiel, Richard]
CAN MAMITA VEN THAT
I want you
I change my luck
This is something urgent
Come and I can't stand
Oh mamita see that
I like you so much
And he never lies

[Verse 1: Erick]
Ju√©cate your luck, always
There is a crucial factor
What makes you wear your best lipstick
Sure mommy, that you come here
I will shout at the four winds
Oh Mamita Vente!
