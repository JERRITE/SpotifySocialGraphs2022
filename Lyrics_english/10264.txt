This Time is Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
We ran away from each other
We grew up and grew apart
We thought we'd find other lovers
We didn't get very far

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it's more than just a feeling, a feeling
It's something to believe in, believe in
Cuz every time you're leaving, you're leaving
I miss you, god damn!
I miss you like hell
[Chorus]
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swеar we'll get it right
It's gonna be thе last time

This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
Gonna be the last time

[Verse 2]
I learned I can't live without ya
Trust me I tried to move on
But every moment's about ya
In every face, every song

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it's more than just a feeling, a feeling
It's something to believe in, believe in
Cuz every time you're leaving, you're leaving
I miss you so bad
I miss you like hell
You might also like[Chorus]
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time

This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
Gonna be the last time
(Gonna be the last time)

[Bridge]
I'll be there by your side
When shit gets crazy
And I'll be better this time
Woah
I'll be there by your side (Better this time)
When shit gets crazy
I'll be there by your side (this time I swear we'll get it right)
I'll be better this time (it’s gonna be the last time)
[Chorus]
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last time
This time is right, this time is right
This time I swear we'll get it right
It's gonna be the last timeEmbed
