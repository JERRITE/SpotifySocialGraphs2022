Lyrics disco ["disco" letter "]

[Intro: Eladio Carrión]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Saying: Eladio Carrión]
So long, hello, tell me what's
Why did you leave? WHY?
Do not mess with me
By second go ', Baby, Please, Don't Lie
You and I inseparable 'like Bonnie and Clyde
Now he has a cold heart like Açai
'Tar single' tá fashionable, Lunay said it
Now comes to 'lo' day ', she' tá rulay
[Choir: Eladio Carrión]
Give it, bébete all alcohol in the disco
But when the note goes down and feels' incomplete
And I don't call me ', I'm not going to take it
You have to talk to the recorder now
I wanted love and you wanted to fuck
That is why the situation never improves
Give it, bébete all alcohol in the disco
But when the note goes down and feels' incomplete

[Saying: Yandel]
(Eh eh)
So much time, hello, tell me what's (oh)
Why did you leave? WHY? (OH)
Do not mess with me
For the second time, Baby, Please, Don't Lie
You and I inseparable 'like Bonnie and Clyde
Now he has a cold heart like Açai (OH-OH)
'Tar single' tá fashionable, Lunay said it
Now it comes out to 'what' day ', she is Rulay

[Verse 1: Yandel & Eladio Carrión]
Baby, call
I wanted love with zero drama
He says he loves me, but e 'mouth na' more '(no-oh)
Leave the show, which I already changed that program, total
When you are 'I don't even feel you, like a hologram
He knows me ', Baby, this goes before' of fame
Of the 'car', the penthouse and the panorama view
But how you loved fighting, yes, only drama, yeah
Give it, drink the alcohol that the promoter brought you (OH-OH)
Says that without me she is better
Do not make me 'laugh, mommy, please (huh, h)
I didn't want to hurt you
But I did it, and I never wanted
You gave a job to my heart
That biceps, soul like freezer
And because of you now I'm a bastard

Yeah, feels empty
I am cold and your shit did not expect it -ba
Bye, Bye, don't tell me '"Don's Cry", Don't Lie (Don't Lie, Yeah)
Now I live in the disco
Your skin has wet me, now thinking about you dries me (I dry)
You answered my love, everyone here sins (sin, sin)
But I didn't think it was' like everything 'that' Feka, Yeah
And now I spend it on the street, at home, in bed
It no longer has a failure (it has no failure)
Better go, the 'detail'
If I want 'I show you how it feels like you fail you
