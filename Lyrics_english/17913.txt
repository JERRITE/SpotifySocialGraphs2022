Do not talk about love lyrics ["Do not talk about love"]

[Verse 1]
Even if you don't accept me roses
I want to find another way
With which I can fall in love, I-YEH, I-YEH
What amazing woman
I just yearn for someday
You give me a chance
Don't deny me your kisses
Sorry if I got romantic
Will not pass again
[Chorus]
So don't talk about love
She doesn't want to fall in love
Your heart is like an iceberg
Do not feel, no
So don't talk about love
She doesn't want to fall in love
Protect your feelings from an illusion

[Post-car]
No no no no
Don't talk about love
Is not interested in a relationship
No no no no
Don't talk about love
He doesn't care about anything, don't try, no

[Verse 2]
Hey, business have become
In your trap I have been wrapped
No, no, your skin is vice, make the sacrifice
Don't kill your hopes to love
I am imprisoned to your caresses
To fall in love there is no rate or price
Let me teach you from love
No pleasure tourism
Strip it of pain
And learn what it is to want

Yours, if you knew, I don't care about pride
My friends say I'm wrong
That I can't fall in love with
Yours, if you knew, I don't care about pride
My friends say I'm wrong
I want to fall in love with you

[Chorus]
So don't talk about love
She doesn't want to fall in love
Your heart is like an iceberg
Do not feel, no
So don't talk about love
She doesn't want to fall in love
Protect your feelings from an illusion

[Post-car]
No no no no
Don't talk about love
Is not interested in a relationship
No no no no
Don't talk about love
He doesn't care about anything, don't try, no

[Outro]
Even if you don't accept me roses
I want to find another way
With whom I can fall in love
No no no no
CD9, whom you want, want
Tell me, what do you want?
No no no no
Don't talk about love
He doesn't care about anything, don't try, Noembed
