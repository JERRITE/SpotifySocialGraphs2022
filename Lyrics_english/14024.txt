Dracula Teeth Lyrics[Verse 1: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
The Railway Arch Confessional
I wrote your name in white emulsion
I drift away with silver faces on display

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
Wake up in an ice cold sweat and my skin starts to creep
You’re hovering above my bed looking down on me
Haunted house sound effects, Dracula teeth

[Verse 2: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
The lover boy’s last resort
Secretly calls the getaway car
Lucky stars rattle the jaws as the drawing bow
[Chorus: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
Wake up in an ice cold sweat and my skin starts to creep
You’re hovering above my bed looking down on me
Haunted house sound effects, Dracula teeth

[Bridge: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
Dracula teeth, lipstick on my pillow via my cheek
The full moon’s glowing yellow and the floorboards creak
C’est horrifique!

[Outro: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
Threatening behaviour bounces 'round my mind
Enthusiasm paraphernalia all over the side
(Dracula teeth) Dracula teeth
(Dracula teeth) Pinball machines on muteYou might also like7Embed
