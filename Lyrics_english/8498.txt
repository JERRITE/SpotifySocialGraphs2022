The Sun - Klingande Remix Radio Edit Lyrics[Intro]
Follow the sun

[Verse 1]
Hop back to my home
The only place I feel alone
I need the foreign soil
Sun rising under my feet
These kids are out here
They are my family
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm gonna tell my momma
That I'm a traveler
I'm gonna follow the sun
Now I'm gonna tell my momma
That I'm a traveler
I'm gonna follow the sun
Follow the sun

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna tell my momma
That I'm a traveler
I'm gonna follow the sun
Don't stop, you got to move
Keep moving on, keep moving on
I'm never gonna stop
Follow the sun
Follow the sun

[Bridge]
Hop back to my home
The only place I feel alone
I need the foreign soil
Sun rising under my feet
These kids are out here
They are my family
Now I'm gonna tell my momma
That I'm a traveler
I'm gonna follow the sun
Now I'm gonna tell my momma
That I'm a traveler
I'm gonna follow the sun
Follow the sun
