Plankton Lyrics [Intro]
You know how it is!

[Pre-refrain]
Not get started, I didn't care about music
I'm embarrassed, I hate attention
But by dint of making me pay to do it
Farting the Booth is become my passion (we whipped)
I record, I make rations
My sound is the sound of our generation
What is the recipe

[Chorus]
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, chill God or I live
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, God chill where I aim

[Verse 1]
In quarantine, you hear your balcony shreez (Shreez)
Mr. Krabs, I have the recipe, I know he was told, little plankton
In his eyes, I see the hunger, I could look nice, but do not
The ambition in the veins, I will smash the ceiling
Free kick, ball, fag, I'm messi in my living room
Menti, brown, I said him that it was going back in a long time
I'm always on id, I could know what my first name
We never embarrass ourselves
If we want, we take (all)
Cheese and crust (I'm hungry)
I tear on a hole, I have a beam
A bat, not a shore (we hit)
Big x on all those who doubt
Antisociable, I'm still in my bubble
I am frozen like the crisse
Yet I'm Shreezy heat wave (ah)
You might also like [Pont]
Well smashed, I always boot with a pack
My bag, a backwood and a mac
A little more rap than typing
When I'm going to blow up the trap
I hurt them like the pope
I launch they catch
I'm a hero without cape
But I never go! (Nope)

[Pre-refrain]
Not get started, I didn't care about music
I'm embarrassed, I hate attention
But by dint of making me pay to do it
Farting the Booth is become my passion (we whipped)
I record, I make rations
My sound is the sound of our generation

[Chorus]
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, God chill where I aim
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, God chill where I aim
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, God chill where I aim
If it's in my way, I'm breaking the
If we grind together, I divide
Believing, but I don't go to the church
Ambitious, God chill where I aim
[Outro]
Not get started, I didn't care about music
I'm embarrassed, I hate attention
