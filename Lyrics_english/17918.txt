Come, tell me that not lyrics [letter of "come, tell me that"]

[Verse 1]
I can't help laughing without stopping
Every time I see you pass
With that guy again
I remember that you left without saying why
And now I understand well
Do me a favor and march
And I hope you do well, oh
[Pre-car]
Tell me that you feel anything when you are with him
And what do you imagine that I am when you see it
Even if you smile, I know it's not the same

[Chorus]
Come, tell me no (woah, oh-oh)
You die for me
You don't know how to pretend (WOAH, OH-OH)
I know you think of me
Even if you want to avoid it, you can't hide it
You want more kisses
I know you will never forget

[Post-car]
Come
Come

[Verse 2]
I remember you said
"There is nothing more to do in this relationship"
And you did not give me an explanation
You can forget about me

[Pre-car]
Tell me that you feel anything when you are with him
And what do you imagine that I am when you see it
Even if you smile, I know it's not the same

I know you will never forget
