SANTA MONICA Lyrics[Intro]
I'm homesick, I'm homesick
Mm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Your remedy
Hard to settle, I'll climb
Your canopy
To make it rain from time to time
Tell me things I don't wanna know (Wanna know)
Said, "Everything's fine, everything"
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I said everything
Where'd you find me?
Below

[Verse 2]
Run it overtime, it got cold as ice
Same overdose, who put a hole inside me
Highs and lows, catapult
Never leave your sights, v√°monos
I've tried, I could look around
See another one about mine
In a heartbeat, what it cost to me to turn right
Put that on my head, bounty hunter
Get you good price, have a good night
Again

[Chorus]
Won't stay long, what a ride, gotta run
This a toast, all my arms ain't up enough
Hopeless, take it all from inside
If all's lost, then how could I fuck it up?
Won't stay long, what a ride, gotta run
This a toast, all my arms ain't up enough
Hopeless, take it all from inside
If all's lost, then how could I fuck it up?

Hate pile in my memories
Fake smiles all it ever is
Take cover, no letting be
Hard to stay silent, hmm, yeah

[Verse 3]
I've tried, I could look around
See another one about mine
It was so easy the first, second, third time
Turned into a habit, kill my brother figure like Raditz
Take an O-Z to the alpines

Wait there!
Hahaha

[Chorus]
Won't stay long, what a ride, gotta run
This a toast, all my arms ain't up enough
Hopeless, take it all from inside
If all's lost, then how could I fuck it up?
Won't stay long, what a ride, gotta run
This a toast, all my arms ain't up enough
Hopeless, take it all from inside
If all's lost, then how could I fuck it up?10Embed
