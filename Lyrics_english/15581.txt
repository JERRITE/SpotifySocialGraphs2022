Dying love lyrics What is dying of love?
Die of love inside
It's running out of your light
Is to lose you in a moment

How can I
Tell you
That your absence is my pain
That without your love I die

Death of love
Slowly and silently without knowing
If everything I have given came to you on time
Death of love
Not to die alone in heartbreak
And not have a name to tell the wind
I'm not sure
What is happening
I have my heart dry
And it is to have cried so much

I have no more
That 2 or 3 memories
A letter to some flower
A very short goodbye and I love you

Death of love
Slowly and silently without knowing
If everything I have given came to you on time
Death of love
Not to die alone in heartbreak
And not have a name to tell the wind

Death of love
Slowly and silently without knowing
If everything I have given came to you on time
Death of love
Not to die alone in heartbreak
And not have a name to tell the wind

Death of love
Slowly and silently without knowing
If everything I've given you in timeyou might also likembed
