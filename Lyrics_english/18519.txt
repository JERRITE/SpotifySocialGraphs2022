Wasting Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wasted away again
Warm milk dripping down my skin
Your words running through my head
If I'm sick, I'm sad, I'm mad

[Pre-Chorus]
On and off and on with you
Off and on and off with you
On and off and on with you
Off and on, in love with you
[Chorus]
Wasted away with you
Taste it 'cause you want it too
On and off and on with you
Off and on and off with you

[Verse 2]
Wasted away again
Your words dripping down my head
Comfort makes me sick again
And I'm sick, I'm sad, I'm mad

[Pre-Chorus]
On and off and on with you
Off and on and off with you
On and off and on with you
Off and on, in love with you

[Chorus]
Wasted away with you
Taste it 'cause you want it too
On and off and on with you
Off and on and off with you

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You might lie and I might cry
I'll wipe my eyes, nevermind
You might also like[Chorus]
Wasted away with you
Taste it 'cause you want it too
On and off and on with you
Off and on and off with you

[Outro]
On and off and on with you
Off and on, in love with you
Off and on, in love with you
Off and on, in love with you
Off and on, in love with you3Embed
