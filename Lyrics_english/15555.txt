The favor of loneliness lyricslesoledad, the only one that comes
When everyone leaves
The only one I can cry with
That does not make me a reproach
Let me vent

Loneliness, I know for a while
Make me from you
And I broke the promise not to be unhappy
And now I'm here crying
For having loved him so much
Go and look for it where you find it
And snatch it from among the people
Take it hand in hand and lock yourself in your room
And keep it, get around, amalo, and if he wants to say goodbye
And make him feel what he has me here breath
Soledad Soledad Soledad
Do me a favor I beg you
Make him feel what I feel
Soledad Soledad Soledad
Do me a favor I implore it
And that he knows that I adore him
Loneliness!

Loneliness, dressed at night
Or clearly tell me to the ear
That he will not return you do not give me any comfort
But you talk to the truth

Yes ... amalo like none
I don't want to know more about the world
That does not recognize family
That life does not conceive without you
That for a kiss the endurance contemptions

And that dreams wrapped in sleeplessness
Let your joy be your crumbs
By knees crying thank you
So ... only then
What knows that he knows
What is it for me that you have
What is it for me to feel you

Do me a favor I implore it
And that he knows that I adore him
