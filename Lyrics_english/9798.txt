Paweł 2 lyrics [intro: Lil Eskimo & Lil Dryer]
Future to TWG
TWG is the future of the fuck
Fuck the microphone test

[Verse 1: Lil Eskimo]
It is not for fame but for fun
That I have something to sing when the fucked up
Paweł did nothing again a bit broken
Paweł, do bits, maybe we'll record something
Paweł Paweł Paweł Paweł Paweł Paweł
No, it was now it's time to change
Black trapfon rings Paweł brought drugging
They all know what will happen now
Welcome to kfc, not in Macdonald
Kentucky Fried Chicken Paweł makes food
I drink vodka again and it's pretty cool
I'm on safari and I have strange actions
This is not an application but a needed support
This state is impossible to go like goals on the waist
Paweł aircraft mode on board
Where is my internet, I lose the signal again

[Verse 2: Lil Dryer]
You won't know what Paweł means here anyway
Who you would not be, we fuck your biographies
If you want to know what Pawel is really
Let you explain you
Paweł makes a bit, does a receipt, a simple matter
TWG makes a hit, we have fucked up on you
You on the tracks you fuck
We have only honest truth
Paweł is a street druid
He never ends mana
Paweł is the king of the jungle
Pawel is my MUFASA COMPLETE
You don't want to piss him off
Because I will kick your dupala
You might also like Likedydyne what he cares is a fucking money
And a lame but not the one with a crooked nose
He has everything, but he will need a lot
Dziwko please, don't jump, Pawel has Horde behind him
He fucks your three groszembed
