You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere Lyrics[Verse 1]
Clouds so swift, rain won’t lift
Gate won’t close, railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain’t goin' nowhere

[Chorus]
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!
[Verse 2]
I don’t care how many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money and pack up your tent
You ain’t going nowhere

[Chorus]
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!

[Verse 3]
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to the tree with roots
You ain’t going nowhere

[Chorus]
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!

Genghis Khan, he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We’ll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it

[Chorus]
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!1Embed
