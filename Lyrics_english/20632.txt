Sky Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wanna feel electric with just one touch
Fall for somebody way too much
And no matter how high, it's never enough
Sky love
Sky love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna go further
I wanna be nervous so much
Won't know that you've found it
Until it feels like
[Chorus]
Sky love
It's insane, but you know when you've got it
Sky love
When you're wild awake with your heart out on the floor
Sky love
Until it feels like
Sky love

[Verse 2]
Not gonna find it down here on the ground
No one will hear me if I don't make a sound
And I know it's scary, but that's how it should feel
Sky love
Sky love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just want a feeling
Don't wanna be numb
A light above that makes me wanna look up like

[Chorus]
Sky lovе
It's insane, but you know when you've got it
Sky lovе
When you're wild awake with your heart out on the floor
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me
Sky love
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me
Until it feels like
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me
Sky love
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me

[Bridge]
I'm holding out for real love
I'm holding out for, I'm holding out for
I'm holding out for real love
I'm holding out until it feels like

[Break]
Sky love
Until it feels like
Sky love
(I'm holding out)

[Chorus]
Sky love
It's insane, but you know when you've got it
Sky love
When you're wild awake with your heart out on the floor
[Post-Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me
Sky love
Hold me, hold me, hold onto me
Until it feels like
Sky loveEmbed
