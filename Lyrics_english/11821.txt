THE LYRICS FLOW [LETTER OF "LA FAGA"]

[Intro]
Jiggy D, haha, Dj Sheky
Records rhythm, unstoppable, tell him

[Chorus]
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
[Verse 1]
Pass me the spher and start writing you
How a thousand liricas who want to leave
But some of them are heavy for you
So what do you do well clean, yes
I like it because you are divine
I would like to examine your Ba-Cteria closer
I know that you are serious
With that cucarrón, I'm going to throw my ve-neno
I go without brake
What do you think if my milk made you in your se-viche?
Nah, knows a bit weird
If you are in your 'day', then I enter the A-tico (haha)
Well slowly
No noise must be made
Dusty
I have two balls to get into the or-fanato
That has two court '
Eye with the towel that you are the man-las
To wash for sweat
That is not a dryer, rather it is your vibes

[Chorus]
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
You Might Also Like [verse 2]
I know very well that you liked the game
In the morning you like your gundery batch
Pure wild (I like, I like it)
When I enter, you feel it in the wind
Because I open the window
So that the smell of mari-sco comes out
Snail and shrimp
Sorry, but your ex has face 'e Mari-scal of the field
Football
And he likes that he likes to be given for the A -ñ
One thousand dollars per season
And from ñapa, it gives you a mother-site
What is you like
That is intelligent and that my se-mestre passes
Without difficulty
That is the most popular of the entire faculty

[Chorus]
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
[Verse 3]
This was pa 'everything' the 'bad thought'
What do they say that my album sounded a bit heavy
You thought badly
I just did the prayer, you had to fill it
Know me from all the rappers
With this I kicked them in the back
Update your flow and rhyme too
That this nardo to your girlfriend takes away the bra
Listen, meditate
If you want to help you, separate an appointment
What this Agree has, I have it in Flow
Accept that this skinny acts
OH-OH, again to the rumba
I grab the mic and give you a tunda
And you don't want me to get the trapo '
In case you did not know, I am the Pope of the chick '

[Chorus]
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
In my house, there is a gas and water leak
What do you want to see, a bad girl?
Do you want to see gas or see drops?
Do you want to see gas or see drops? Embed
