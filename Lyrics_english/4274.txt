Between you and me lyrics [lyrics between you and me "]

[Intro]
UUH
UUH
Aah
Aah

[See 1]
If there is nothing to say
Not anything to talk about
It is not necessary to explain you
If you keep all the secrets
From my life and my dreams
And you know
[Pre-chorus]
You are the only song
I will always write
Following my beats
Each word, every note
What do you give me makes me feel that I am with you

[Chorus]
It is a connection between you and me
In each verse of this song
Your voice and mine
In each chord, in each rhyme

It is a connection between you and me
In each verse of this song
It is so different next to you
I am what I am if you are here

[Bridge]
UUH
UUH
Aah
Aah

If there is nothing to say
Not anything to talk about
I give you silence
And I listen to everything you feel
What happens through your mind
Now you know
Aah

Your voice and mine
In each chord, in each rhyme

It is a connection between you and me
In each verse of this song
It is so different next to you
I am what I am if you are here
