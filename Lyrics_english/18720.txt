Sleepless Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Midnight, driving 'till my eyes give up
Headlights to your apartment
This ride, I done it 'bout a thousand times
But it doesn't feel right here without you

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to windows down in ocean air
Sunset eyes through messy hair
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights
I know that it's over, but it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer, I still see
[Chorus]
Midnight drives and summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Face up, watching all the streetlights turn
To shadows in my apartment
Ten months, I swear I should be fine by now
But it still gives me a head rush when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes me back to
Rooftop, moonlight, silhouettes
Purple skies and cigarettes
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights
I know that it's over, but it's haunting me
Like a ghost of the summer, I still see

[Chorus]
Midnight drives and summer skin
The taste of liquor on your lips
I miss chasing down the morning light
And all those sleepless nights
All those sleepless nights
All those sleepless nights
You might also like[Outro]
(I know that it's over
Like a ghost of the summer)1Embed
