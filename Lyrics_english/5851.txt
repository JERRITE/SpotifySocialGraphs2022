Shouldâ€™ve Gone to Bed Lyrics[Verse 1]
I only miss you at midnight
But when that lonely clock strikes
That's when I wish you were here
The angel knows it's not right
But the devil's in my heart tonight
Whispering things in my ear

[Pre-Chorus]
So I down my cup
And then I hit you up
Saying stupid stuff...
[Chorus]
Oh, I should've just gone to bed
I should've never called you
I should've listened to my head
When it said leave it alone

No, a few drinks in
Here I go missing you again
God only knows what I said
I should've just gone to bed
I should've just gone to bed

[Verse 2]
All day long I'm over you
Never really think of you
I keep you out of my head
But some nights when I'm striking out
You're all I can think about
Just gotta have you again

[Pre-Chorus]
So I down my cup
And then I hit you up
Saying way too much

[Chorus]
Oh, I should've just gone to bed
I should've never called you
I should've listened to my head
When it said leave it alone
You might also likeNo, a few drinks in
Here I go missing you again
God only knows what I said
I should've just gone to bed

[Bridge]
I should've turned the lights out
I should've called it a night
You should've never picked up my phone call
If you're not sleeping here tonight

[Chorus]
I should've just gone to bed
I should've never called you
I should've listened to my head
When it said leave it

I should've just gone to bed
I should've never called you
I should've listened to my head
When it said leave it alone

No, a few drinks in
Here I go missing you again
God only knows what I said
I should've just gone to bed
I should've just gone to bed
I should've gone to bedEmbed
