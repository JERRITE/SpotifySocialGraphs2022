Love Till It’s Over Lyrics[Verse]
Whenever you leave it's hard to hold on
This feeling is deep, I'm losing control
You're takin' my mind, now I'm losin' sleep
It's hard to breathe without you, I can't let go

[Chorus]
Let me hear your heart speak
I'm listenin' so tell it to me softly
It's all love, it's all love, it's all love
It's all love 'til it's over
[Drop Filler]
It's all love

All love 'til it's over

[Chorus]
Let me feel your heartbeat
I'm at it so just give it to me softly
Let me hear your heart speak
I'm listenin' so tell it to me softly
