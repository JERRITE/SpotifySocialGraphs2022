Troubled Wine Lyrics...(Lyrically Accurate! / Only on Lyric Wiki!)...

Take your time, time
Take your time, take it Mama
Take your sweet time
Take your time, take it baby
Lo', I'm gonna get to you, now...
Don't even try, ain't getting by Mama
Think ya can, but ya can't
No getting by babe
Lo', I'm gonna get to you
The bottom of the barrel, yeah
Where I've been, always be
It's where I find reality
I ain't seein' clear no, I don't wanna be
Let me drown in my misery, yeah, oh baby

Wine - Oh I'll make you mine baby
Serve you a glass of my troubled wine
Wine - Yeah I'll make you mine baby
Serve you up a glass of my troubled wine
...My troubled wine babe

Now listen... Tell me what you is
Tell me who you is, what you be
Lord I'll be your ship
Your ship sinkin' in the sea
Lo', just take my hand... When you hurt
When you cry, when you bleed
A little ship, a little bit's all ya need
Oh, I'm always here for you...

The bottom of the barrel, yeah
Where I've been, always be
It's where I find reality, now
I ain't seein' clear no, no I don't wanna be babe
Just let me drown in my misery, yeah, yeah
