Space Between Lyrics[Verse 1: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron]
I didn't know what you were going through
I thought that you were fine
Why did you have to hide?
I didn't want to let you down
But the truth is out
It's tearing me apart, not listening to my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron]
I really had to go
And I would never stop you
Even though we've changed
Nothing has to change
[Chorus: Sofia Carson & Dove Cameron]
And you can find me in the space between
Where two worlds come to meet
I'll never be out of reach
'Cause you're a part of me so you can find me in the space between
You'll never be alone
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between

[Verse 2: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron]
And nothing can stay the same
It's growing pains
Be proud of all the scars
They make you who you are (oh, woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron]
I know you have to stay
But I'll never really leave you
Nothing has to change
Even though we've changed

[Chorus: Sofia Carson & Dove Cameron]
And you can find me in the space between
Where two worlds come to meet
I'll never be out of reach
'Cause you're a part of me so you can find me in the space between
You'll never be alone
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between

There are no words left to say
I know you gotta find your place
But this is not the end (no)
You're part of who I am
Even if we're worlds apart
You're still in my heart
It will always be you and me, yeah

[Chorus: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron, Both]
You can find me in the space between
Where two worlds come to meet
I'll never be out of reach (I'll never be out of reach, no)
'Cause you're a part of me so you can find me in the space between
You'll never be alone
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between

[Outro: Sofia Carson, Dove Cameron, Both]
Yeah, no matter where you go
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between9Embed
