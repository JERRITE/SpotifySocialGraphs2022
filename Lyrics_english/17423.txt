Better Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
As all these people come and go
Like wind blows in and out of my life (Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo)
Right now, there's no one else I'd rather hold
Than you, oh, while the world is on fire (Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause as the days go
I know it's been getting too much
But now I'm here, so
You don't have to do this alone
[Chorus]
So, I say, "Hey
Don't ever change, don't rearrange
You're on your way, we'll stick together
I went through this rain and summer came
We're on our way to better days"

[Drop]
Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, oh-oh, ho-ho
You're on your way to better days
Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, oh-oh, ho-ho
We're on our way to better days

[Verse 2]
Took it all to fall apart
To let it show what really don't matter (Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo)
Wherever you are is my heart
So stay close and I won't let it shatter (Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause as the days go
I know it's been getting too much
But now I'm here, so
You don't have to do this alone

[Chrous]
So, I say, "Hey
Don't ever change, don't rearrange
You're on your way, we'll stick together
I went through this rain and summer came
We're on our way to better days"

To better days
