Goodnight Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a nail in the door
And there's glass on the lawn
Tacks on the floor and the TV is on
And I always sleep with my guns
When you're gone
There's a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor, and some cash on the nightstand
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
And I just can't stand
[Chorus]
What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door and followed me home
Well goodnight moon, I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon

[Verse 2]
There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching through the wall

[Chorus 2]
Oh what should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
I just hate to be all alone
Outside the door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
You might also like[Bridge]
Well you're up so high
How can you save me
When the dark comes here tonight to take
Out my front walk
And into bed where it kisses my face
And eats my head

[Chorus]
What should I do, I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside my door it followed me home
Now goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
No, it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon3Embed
