My Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Ugh, I don't even know you, but we text and
That turns into sexting, my mind you've been testing
The one thing I lack is a lack of affection
See, just like my math, I've been stackin' my exes
You ain't the one, since you I've been sippin' in some
And you and him ain't everything that you wish that he was
You hit Witt and then quit, so in the long run
You just fuck with my feelings for fun, say it!
You love me right now, well, then prove it to me!
"I promise I'm different," That's hard to believe
'Cause you talk, talk, talk, never walk, walk, walk
Guess a lame motherfucker is all you gon' be
Never want to be surface, I swim in the deep
Man, I swim in the deep
Hate on my music, hate on my concepts
Honestly, this is just me being me
So fuck your opinion, I stick to my vision
Makin' this music and all the decisions
I'm sorry, fake friendsâ€”I was always too driven
That caused a division, you hate but still listen, it's funny
Rappin' 'bout money makes money
Nowadays everybody wantin' something from me
You stealin' my style, gon' have to tear it from me
I would never dumb it, dumb it down for you dummies, ugh
[Chorus: Trippz Michaud]
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up

[Verse 2: Trippz Michaud]
What you hidin' behind that YouTube icon?
Wait until they kill that YouTube icon
Tried to make everyone happier, was I wrong?
People wanna see you fail when you've given your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life in the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I shoulda take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah!
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain, I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see it today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themself
So you hear about it's annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help
Look into my eyes and see what they reveal
I'ma be a legend, I promise that for real, yeah
You might also like[Chorus: Trippz Michaud]
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up

[Verse 3: Witt Lowry]
And I can't wait to go read all your comments
Like, "Mark only, Mark only talks about girls"
You listened to two songs, man, you are too wrong
Here is my nut for you internet squirrels
I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rocks and chillin' with Peyton
I'm waitin' on tables, but waitin' for tables to turn
It's TEAMWITT, motherfucker, 'til death on my urn
Now I'm next to the rest and y'all waitin' your turn
But they want me fail or to crash and to burn, so I
Pour gas on the fire
Motherfuck me? See, your mom is a liar
I'm probably workin' while you go get higher
You lookin' for real, well, see, I'm the supplier
You lookin' for talent, then pray for mitosis, you're hopeless
I'm hopin' you notice, your fan base is fake
And you hope I don't notice you're full of more shit
Than the back of a rodent, go act like you know 'em
Your rappin' is surface, I'm rappin' a poem
A trojan to catch poetry when she blow 'em
I told 'em, we we're gonna get it
Built up a team and a vision and always stick with it
It's funny my style, you bit it
But knowin' how phoney you are, you ain't never admit it
Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon
When I'm leaving my room, all you rappers are doomed
Witt Lowry, what the fuck you ever heard about me
Keep your bullshit from around me
Two fingers up, you know nothin' about me
And one finger up to a fuck tryna doubt me, ugh!11Embed
