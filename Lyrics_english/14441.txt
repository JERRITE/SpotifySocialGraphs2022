[Choir: Karol G & Mariah Angeliq]
I'm there with the usual, a bastard flow
Turning in a machine
Crystalloe 'G5 in a capsulon (in a capsulon)
And since I left (since I left)
To 'want to repeat (they want to repeat)
But I am in another, baby, I already left
And now I'm there with the usual, a bastard flow
Turning in a machine
Crystalloe 'G5 in a capsulon (in a capsulon)
And I walk there with the usual, a Flow bastard (EH-EH-EH)
Turning in a machine (ah)
Crystalloe 'G5 in a capsulon (Mariah, Baby)
[Verse 1: Mariah Angeliq & Karol G]
And the bus is G5, baby, pa `` I enter
Podo 'beautiful
I want to handcuff you as if it were a barracks (Yey)
An airbnb or no 'vamo' for a hotel
Wherever I like (how)
To escape 'you tell me how (oh)
Tell me if I know 'or not somo', none forgive
This booty goes trending and that e 'without giving it promo

From Chamaquita breaking the law (the law)
The dm explodes, but that there is no break (no)
We ate today, tomorrow replay (ah-ah)
To down from the seventeenth '
From Chamaquita breaking the law (the law)
The dm explodes, but e 'that there is no break (uy)
We ate today, tomorrow replay (now there is no break, daddy)

I'm there with the usual, a Flow bastard (AH-AH)
Turning in a machine (ah; ey)
Crystalloe 'G5 in a capsulon (in a capsulon)

I got bored of the jeepeta and took a machine (daddy)
That when I accelerate it they feel the pressure
Bellaquita by profession (-ion), put for problem (-ón)
My 'Devil' walk toa 'of mission
I walk in a Lamborghini who on the carpet says "Devil"
Pa'rriba the door if I open it
Baby, compare me with whatever, I child
My son is going to be a millionaire from childbirth (daddy; wuh)
Of my babie 'none lowers him
The New Jards' of Caja
And nobody pays for it (no)
You like them like me, don't do (come and give it, ey)

We met us today, tomorrow replay (ah-ah)
To down from the seventeenth '(Yeh)
From Chamaquita breaking the law (law-law)
The dm explodes, but that there is no break (give, give)
We ate today, tomorrow replay (now there is no break, daddy)
