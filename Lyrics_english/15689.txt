Good Lyricsla love we don't think or imagine
Everything that would happen
Only with a look

You approached in a mysterious way
And in that precise instant
I confess I liked you ..

You woke up in me the curiosity
Suddenly this love began to enter
But of that good love ..
And it was already written
That your kisses touched me
That one and a thousand ways
We would tell each other

Is that something so perfect
I can't put you buts
Any momentary is good
To give you a good kiss

And how not to fall in love
If you have what I like
THE PROCESS OF LOVING YOU
You will see how much you enjoy

The paths of your body
I go to the censorship
That they even look pretty
All my dirty words ..

We did not have it thought
But see how we are here
The two well in love ..

(And is 50 small caliber)
You Might Also Likey is that it was already written
That your kisses touched me
That one and a thousand ways
We would tell each other

Is that something so perfect
I can't put you buts
Any momentary is good
To give you a good kiss

And how not to fall in love
If you have what I like
THE PROCESS OF LOVING YOU
You will see how much you enjoy

The paths of your body
I go to the censorship
That they even look pretty
All my dirty words ..

We did not have it thought
But see how we are here
The two well in love
