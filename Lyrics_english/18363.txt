Vroom Lyrics Song Text from Famke Louise - "Vroom" ft. Bokoesam

[Intro]
Y-Y-Y-Yung Felix
Famke Louise, Aha

[Hook: Famke Louise]
Maybe I will buy a Bentley
Maybe I will buy a Honda
In my Jacka with fur collar
Driving to the Fashion Week
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Maybe I will buy a Bentley
Maybe I will buy a Honda
In my Jacka with fur collar
Driving to the Fashion Week
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Pious, pious, pious, pious
[Fresh 1: Famke Louise]
Maybe I buy some ice
Maybe I will buy your wife
I don't want honey with rice
Wants my champagne with ice
In the beginning it was nothing
But now I flex on your bitch
All those guys on my lip
Can't hate, I'm rich

[Hook: Famke Louise]
Maybe I will buy a Bentley
Maybe I will buy a Honda
In my Jacka with fur collar
Driving to the Fashion Week
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Maybe I will buy a Bentley
Maybe I will buy a Honda
In my Jacka with fur collar
Driving to the Fashion Week
Pious, pious, pious, pious
Pious, pious, pious, pious

[Fresh 2: Bokoesam]
EY, EY
Maybe I buy a new chain (ooh)
I have head again, that's a new brain (Vroom)
Famke says, she's coming here (Famke)
And she also knows that it will be a problem (yes)
Damn Bokoeyoncé, how do you do that? (you do that)
Is only sannie in my gucci bag (in my gucci bag)
Yes, I am the master, you the new class (ooh)
New jacket, new coupe
Have a new sauce
(Yoncé)
