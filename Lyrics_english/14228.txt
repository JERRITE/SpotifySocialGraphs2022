Latchmere Lyrics[Intro]
Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Just stay in your lanes
Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Just stay in your lanes

[Verse 1]
No bombing and no heavy petting
So just stay in your lanes
Verruca socks and not forgetting to
Just stay in your lanes
[Chorus]
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Madames and monsieurs please return to your cubicles
Latchmere's got a wave machine

[Post-Chorus]
Oo oo oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo oo

Came out of the changing rooms
Absolutely nothing had changed
So I stayed in your lane
Came out of the changing room
And absolutely fuck all had changed
So I stayed in your lane

Speedos, speed by

So I stayed in your lane
