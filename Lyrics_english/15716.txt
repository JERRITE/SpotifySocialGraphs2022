Lyricsletra is better like "it is better like this ..." [stanza i]
My brother deciding what is better
The kartoffle hurts, Dumbledore left
My queen with two, I with rum
J, without any of the two
Smoking a j in his car
She only vomited for love, I don't know if you keep doing it but Fuck ...
Like Bobby, to 'became twisted ...
Honey, call me, call me ... refile
He asked me to rot with me and now that I think about what I have made you
Honey, I just ask you to stay with the bad known
Fate, vahido
My lantern does not light the way
Vacuum, boredom
Sunk my ship
Nor from me I trust
A scamless scam
[Chorus]
It's better that way
It's better that way
It's better that way
It is better asá
IS BETTER Like This
IS BETTER Like That
It's better that way
It is better asá
It's better that way
You will already understand

Bubbling a Has
Rebujito and Hezbollah
Where the Bourbon, the Jaguar and the Guaraná?
Meanwhile, Diogenes eating lentils
I, throwing tiles to mountains of stones
You are not, Campana and Jet Lag
My mental Lenten, more television and hash
You don't answer ...
The legs tremble, after the war
But now another war will make it tremble
Salaralá
Will heal, they will tell you
But not even 100
Fill the hole you leave
They miss us in that hostel
For you I cried a river, mom cried a sea
You Might Also Like [chorus]
It's better that way
It's better that way
It's better that way
It is better asá
IS BETTER Like This
IS BETTER Like That
It's better that way
It is better asá
It's better that way
You will already understand

[Stanza 3]
Liters of coffee, MD and José Mercé
Cocaine diet, drinks and phalafel
One hundred thousand feet without harness
Delays in your rule, in my payments at the end of the month
I built you a neuschwanstein and you don't even see it
And I bound with hands and feet
Your face on my wall without being Belmez
My face between two whores, Baby Mayday
And of course I lied to you
But I loved you located
And of course I lied to you
But I loved you located
Clicking me heparin, silence in the attic
MY KATRINA, MY LOST CAUSE
When you said I didn't write you
My forty days of Valkiria, Gyal ... 1embed
