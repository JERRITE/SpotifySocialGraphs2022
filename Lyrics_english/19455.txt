​i don’t wanna party Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hate that I ever called you names
Like a quarterback you called the plays
I don't really wanna play those games
I don't really wanna stay the same at all
You can tell that I'm trying to change
You knew who I was way before the fame came
Way before the rain came
Way before the blame game
Back when I would hold you down
Way before I tried to hold you back
Oh baby, why is it always the same thing?
Got two damn phones, and never call you back
It's a damn shame
'Cause I built these walls up so damn high
Need an airplane and some champagne
[Chorus]
I don't wanna party, but I hate to think about you with somebody else, uh, yeah
Our love has gone cold, you left mine to find home with somebody else, yeah, yeah
Looking through you while you're looking through your phone, and you're leaving with somebody else, yeah, yeah
No, I don't wanna party, but I hate to think about you with somebody else, yeah

[Verse 2]
So I got this can and this smoke, uh
Bitch, I'm Nick Cannon, yeah, I'm wildin' out
And I hope you can handle the jokes, uh
I got my foot on their throat, no, no
I'm not the one who gon' choke
I got a Stone Island coat I don't wear now
'Cause I learned to handle the cold, yeah
All on my own, all of my dogs, yeah, we live by the code

[Chorus]
I don't wanna party, but I hate to think about you with somebody else, yeah, uh
Our love has gone cold, you left mine to find home with somebody else, yeah, yeah (Somebody else, yeah)
Looking through you while you're looking through your phone, and you're leaving with somebody else
No, I don't wanna party, but I hate to think about you with somebody else
Somebody else, yeahYou might also like1Embed
