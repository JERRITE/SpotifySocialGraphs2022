TranslationsEspañolMercury Lyrics[Intro: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
(Ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)

[Verse 1: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
Gemini
I'm a myth and I'm a legend
Whom never wins
And might not ever play again
Keep falling in (Keep falling in, yeah)
Love so fast and back out again
Speeding
When I should ease in
[Pre-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Oh, I know myself, my sins
Dug my pit, then I fell in
Pulled the trigger, killed us both
Lesson learned but truth gets old

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
Little of heaven, little unpleasant (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
Little of pleasure, little depression (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
Little of heaven, little unpleasant (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
How can I tell if? How can I measure? (Ooh, ah)
If I don't know (Ooh, ah)

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Woah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ah)

[Verse 2: Steve Lacy]
I lookеd up at the ceiling as I draft my "I'm so sorry" text
Don't rеgret the choice I chose but do regret the mess I made
I see you hurt, I wish I could just hold you tight and close
Don't need long, just wanna say, "I love you and miss you most"

Oh, I know myself, my skin
Rolling stones don't crawl back in
Daddy's faults fell down on me
Break that curse for sweet relief

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
Little of heaven, little unpleasant (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
Little of pleasure, little depression (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
Little of heaven, little unpleasant (Ooh, ah)
I don't know (Ooh, ah)
How can I tell if? How can I measure? (Ooh, ah)
If I don't know (Ooh, ah)

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)

[Verse 3: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
Mercury running amuck in my mind
Can't tell if I'm winning or falling behind
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Venus in retrograde got me in bed
And thinkin' 'bout all of the shit that I said
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Ba-ba-ba (Ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Gemini scope give me depth 'til I'm dead
But I can't seem to get the fuck out of my head
Well, fuck it, I'll just cop a Porsche instead
I do as I please and you see where it lead
Guess somethin' bad ain't 'bout to happen to me
You think I'm two-faced, I can name twenty-three
[Bridge: Steve Lacy]
My layers, all these sides
Could you stick by for the ride?
It's a thrill, and I don't even know how to feel
It might be too real
Might be too—
Real, might be too real, real
I said, "Might be too—"
Might, I said, "Might be too real, real"
I said, "Might be too real"

[Outro: Fousheé & Steve Lacy]
Excuse me if I lied
I forgot I said that
Can you forgive my tongue?
I'll show you where my head at
I don't think I'm the one
But I could be your girlfriend
'Til retrograde is done14Embed
