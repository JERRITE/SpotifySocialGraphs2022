Last Man Standing Lyrics [text of "Last Man Standing"]

[Intro]
And tell me you expect
Count if you give how many you take
But I stay up, I'm last man standing
Between fast food music, all trash and selfie

[Verse]
You gave me by finished after my post mortem
The audience went crazy to the cry of no comment
I turned with the hill inside the Walkman
My mouth rod of revolver acts as a problem solver, hey
Outside it is cold less twenty
Inside I go down to zero Kelvin
For this money it is sti concerts
We will die deaf but happy
Because I don't fill the glass me
If you don't believe me, then come and see
The money you keep in the ear
They should tell you that you have to change professionals
I was silent two years to feel that you have to say
The only result I have had is to understand that no one now wants to do the rhymes
I hear you and think: '' oh well ''
Maybe it's better to prevent and in fact I don't take it with you
I'll take it with who writes you, I have to intervene
They are the Todesking of the Moleskine
You can make the opening to my opening
What day is it? Chemenefottedì
And don't look at me if your mon for
It doesn't make pumps to you, the double yes to me
Nicolino I say straight in the face
That a recorded record is enough for me
And suddenly it is Wilson Season
I don't want advice no and not even children no
You don't know how much fear I have that resemble me
The Got Enemies, Enemies, if you want to ask me, ask me
I write only to repeat myself over the centuries and centuries
How come you tatui the euros, twenty cents
And your bitch fucks you and asks you: "Put me plealcheville"
Today that the world is already in the hands of the stupid
I have to lock myself, they only talk about numbers, numbers and numbers
There are those who try, there are those who dare
I remain the sensational test that is not just a question of fashion
Rap in Italy will still be able to say something
[Pre-Crs]
And tell me you expect
Matters if you give them how many you take
But I stay up, I'm last man standing
Between fast food music, all trash and selfie

[Refrain]
Oh My God, I'm Last Man Standing
Oh My God, I'm Last Man Standing
Oh My God, I'm Last Man Standing
What remains standing if you give up, you hear
Take me, take me so much you don't take me
I know that artists copy, these flows don't invent them
Take me, take me so much you don't take me
For me it is more fun if you offend yourself

[Outro]
I'm with mine, party boy, burns like a blunt
Who are you? Fuck do you want? What do you bring you here?
Baba Jaga, John Wick, this is not done, who is wrong pays
Don't snitch for eternity
I'm with mine, party boy, burns like a blunt
Who are you? Fuck do you want? What do you bring you here?
Baba Jaga, John Wick, this is not done, who is wrong pays
Don't Snatch for Eternitàoyou Might Also Like3embed
