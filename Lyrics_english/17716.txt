No Censor! Lyrics[Intro]
BIGGZ the Engineer, baby
Gotcha

[Verse 1: UnrulyBad]
If you don't talk 'bout drills (Drills)
They won't love no more (Fake)
Ned just wanted a cheeseburger
Max, what you do that for?
Knockout's juice gets spilled on the floor (Pussy)
Huh, now you done started a war
No ping-pong, gang cuttin' tru' Burgess back and forth (Ping)
In jail, smashed CDai's head on the floor
Frontline, nobody can cross it (But try now)
You can drive tru'
But nobody can walk it (Walk it)
L2, R2
Now GB in a casket (Dead)
Forensics settin' up tents
Now them haffi white chalk it (Deceased)
Bill him up and just rass him (Now you're fucked)
[Verse 2: Karma]
Incog got put in a spliff (Bill it)
GB got put in a spliff (Bill it)
SA got put in a spliff (Bill it)
Lil CJ got put in a spliff
OT nearly got put in a rizz (Ugh)
Paul nearly got put in a rizz (Ugh)
Naghz Max got bored in the wig
Gang love crash, bore and dip
Been Circle hella times on the road, we bored his bro
Couldn't find Biggz
Gave him like twenty or more, no fibs (Oh shit)
Pissed, should've got put in a spliff (I'm pissed)
Ayy, remember when I bored up uh
Had a smile on my face, that was funny as shit (Ha-ha)
'Cah I had the big man screamin' out, "mummy"
Nowhere near where his mumzy lives

[Verse 3: Trizzac]
(Trizzla)
My blade hit his chest-plate
Next day, swear, I had his best friend runnin' (Kevin)
I done beat up Rampz in probation
He shouldn't have pushed my buttons
Why'd you think that they call me Judas?
I laugh and giggle at my dead opp cousin (Incog)
Loose says that he chings, he doesn't (No)
Trust me, gang done cheffed up dozens (Ching)
I'm tryna see the opps get shot (Bow)
Same way GB done got-got (Bow, bow)
Or how CJ done got dropped (Ching)
Surely dem man has had enough? (They have)
But trust me, the beef don't stop (No)
So we're out 'ere tryna put another in the box
I done beat up Jimmy before he turn dust
Twins and Loski watched Naghz get chopped (Shameless)

On the ride, bro pass that hammer
Rock and roll 'til the drum Mick Jagger
It don't matter, twenty-one years
Free bro, a real opp blammer (Bow)
If I scratch this yout', no mask
Then it's back to the slammer, soc' and bang up (Scratch him up)
If I scratch this yout', no mask
Then it's back to the slammer, soc' and bang up (Get it)
Trizz, rise up things
Swing that shit, I know his intent was murder
Reverse that whip
It might be flizz, but I'll do it and burn that drip (Burner)
Me, LV, jailhouse pissed
Still cut a man up or we'll swing our fists
And I swear on my life, even govs got hit
That day that we got down Chris

[Verse 5: LR]
Rage got smoked like 'Dam
And his dad got splashed
Come ride, like damn (Splash)
Same day Loose got bored on his block
Loose tried dash, they shoulda got cramp
He ain't got one, how the hell's he rappin’?
He jumped off third floor, we got your lad
Ain’t-ain't got a suitcase when we be packin’
Like Tiny knows, had his flesh on our shanks (Yo)
Ask when I slapped that lead
They're lucky I missed, shoulda turned man pack
Fuck these ratchets, I need me a hot girl
Would've thought that her name's Katie Pam
Their boy got slapped and it wasn't with hands
Dingers or peds, what I'm into Milan
Rep 3x3, grab the .9, let it bang
If I see any graves, know I'm pissin’ on that
[Verse 6: Kwengface]
(Yo-Yo) Deqwan got bored in his arm real quick
‘Cah the boy tried to cover his tizzac
Mars-Mars-Mars got cheffed by the W Street
True say it was me that did that (Get them both)
Rage is dead, SK's dead
All now none of us man been packed (Ugh)
Ride for Latz
OnSight got on sighted
All now he ain't been back (Where you at?)
About five whole gangs man's beefin’ (Uh-uh)
They either been shot or stabbed (True)
I tried drill it on a Circle yout' up close
True say that the handting jammed (Lucky fool)
Yo, them man act for the Snapchat
Them man are nuttin' without their dads ('Low it)
PS just shot up the 9
Now man's doing up cheeky snaps (Bap)
