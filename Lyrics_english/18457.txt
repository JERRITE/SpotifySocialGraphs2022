TranslationsTürkçeMindset Lyrics[Verse]
Point blank mad man
Enter my mind and you'll see what's at hand
Thoughts of confusion my vision is bland
Under the threshold of darkness, I stand
Meaningless words from a dying man
Please won't you tell me if you understand every cigarette
Smoked as I cut at my throat
I'm just trying to cope in this world of the damned lost
Hope, can I find light?
Someone please help me I'm trying to fight
This ain't no depression
This is a recession
Just trying to find my way in life
Demons they dragging the light, it brags
Stuck in the middle, I'm feeling at home
Neutral belief's so my thoughts are my own
Just a being in his own zone
Happiness but still I feel pissed
This world is so fucked It`s just that we`re missed
Feel the kiss from the lips, the woman of death so now I feel bliss
Toned to my fucking dome
Never had friends so I sit in silence
This is what I have become so when
I die this will be my mindsetYou might also like4Embed
