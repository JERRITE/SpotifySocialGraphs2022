Nothing Is As It Seems Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nothing is as it seems
Caught in the in-between
Shadows disguised, and I don't know why
Nothing is as it seems

[Verse 2]
Something got a hold of me
Lying in a bed of thieves
What is reality? (ooh)
[Verse 3]
Bent and broken, left it wide open
Everything's crashing down
Standing here frozen, truth is showing
And I know now

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing is as it seems (ooh)
Nothing is as it seems (aah)

[Chorus 1]
Nothing (ooh)
Nothing (aah)
Nothing is as it seems

Nothing (ooh)
Nothing (aah)
Nothing is as it seems

[Bridge]
Bent and broken
Left wide open
Everything's crashing down
Nothing is as it seems

[Chorus 2]
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing is as it seems
You might also likeNothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing is as it seems

[Outro]
Nothing is as it seems
Caught in the in-between
Shadows disguised and I don't know why

Nothing is as it seemsEmbed
