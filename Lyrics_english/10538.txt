Silent war Lyrics[Verse]
I am running out of fingers
I am running out of toes
I wished (?)
I am down to little  foes
Future's gone ballistic
Because the past must take control
I'm calling order
I'm stealing back the soul

[Pre-Chrous]
Do you like me once a day?
(?) decay
? overrated
(we can make a deal tonight)
Shame and hate have copulated
Love should be reciprocated
Now let's see if you can take it yeah
[Chorus]
The papers never lie, the sweetest alaby
You sung with your hand, the man that could not hang
This is thе silent war, there won't bе any more
And though the water's gone, we're still the greatest one

[Verse]
Yeah you're running out of rations
While you're serving up the war
Sending out offashion
Tear it with your claw
With all this implication
Tell me what you're gonna do
Can you tell the nation
Can you lick what's in your wounds

[Pre-Chrous]
Do you like me once a day?
(?) decay
? overrated
(we can make a deal tonight)
Shame and hate have copulated
Love should be reciprocated
Now let's see if you can take it yeah

[Chorus]
The papers never lie, the sweetest alaby
You sung with your hand, the man that could not hang
This is the silent war, there won't be any more
And though the water's gone, we're still the greatest one
You might also likeThe papers never lie, the sweetest alaby
You sung with your hand, the man that could not hang
This is the silent war, there won't be any more
And though the water's gone, we're still the greatest oneEmbed
