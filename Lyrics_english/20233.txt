MTM, hit 'em with the heat

[Chorus]
Five six, grew an inch with them Timbs on
I need forty-five thousand to sing songs
Now they mad ’cause they bitch gon' sing along
You ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone
Five six, grew an inch with them Timbs on
I need forty-five thousand to sing songs
Now they mad ’cause they bitch gon' sing along
You ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I don't need nobody help but I feel like I'm dyin'
Beggin' for someone to pick me up and keep me thrivin'
If I said I love myself, I know I would be lyin’
Lookin’ up at the stars and I can't see myself survivin’

[Verse]
On point, no deadshot, bass drop like napalm bombs
Everybody swing arms, armed with a Glock 9
Left, right, left, right
Every red light, fuckboy wanna take mine
I just wanna see my baby mama livin' lavish and laughin'
Enemies wanna put me in a casket
For what though? I don't know
I don’t control what these grown men think about when they solo
I'm sick of the photos for people I don't know
So I put tints on that four-door
I'd rather be nothing than noticed
I'd rather be something than nothing, I come slow
I need the money, keep the fame and the drugs and the pain and the lames from my face
The waves in the lanes that I paved way back in the day
Keep me cruisin' away from the ladders and the nooses

[Chorus]
Five six, grew an inch with them Timbs on
I need forty-five thousand to sing songs
Now they mad cause they bitch gon' sing along
You ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone
Five six, grew an inch with them Timbs on
I need forty-five thousand to sing songs
Now they mad cause they bitch gon' sing along
You ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone

Yeah, I don't need nobody help but I feel like I'm dyin'
Beggin' for someone to pick me up and keep me thrivin'
If I said I love myself, I know I would be lyin'
Lookin' up at the stars and I can't see myself survivin'

[Outro]
I don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain
I don't ever wanna maintain, maintain
I'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay
Pray you never get lonely, lonely
I don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain
I don't ever wanna maintain, maintain
I'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay
Pray you never get lonely, lonely
I don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain
I don't ever wanna maintain, maintain
I'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay
Pray you never get lonely, lonely
I don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain
I don't ever wanna maintain, maintain
I'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay
Pray you never get lonely, lonely14Embed
