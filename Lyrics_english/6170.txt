Good Time - R3HAB Remix Lyrics[Intro]
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna a good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna- Hit me one more time

[Verse 1]
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna get drunk with my friends
Talk about some nonsense
With girls that we just met
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna go out, midnight
Low key, no fights
I'm messed up, man you drive
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna tell the barback line 'em up ('Em up)
'Cause the whole world needs some love (Some love)
[Chorus]
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna

[Verse 2]
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna catch vibes with strangers
Find out we're neighbors
From back in LA, yeah
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna call up my exes
Wish them the bestest
I'm that kinda wasted
I just- I just- I just-
Wanna tell the barback line 'em up (Oh-oh-oh)
'Cause the whole world needs some love

[Chorus]
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna

[Chorus]
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna good time, I
I just wanna good time, I
I got enough on my mind, I
Yeah, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna good time, I

I got enough on my mind, I
