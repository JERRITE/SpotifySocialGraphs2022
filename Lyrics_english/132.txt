If I have nothing -
If I have nothing -
One more, one more, one more
One more, one more, one more equals two

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, I'm saying something, they want it the old way (yeah)
I'm down the block, the windows are so blurred (Yeah)
Never said, "I can't", my bro, at all (at all)
Every time we go crazy, this is rock n 'roll, baby
[Verse 1: pusha t]
I'm back to the basics, I'm back in the matrix
I took Maybach back, back, now it's for races
They stapled Mеus phones, so I blushed the faces
The new David Ruffin, I just follow Temptation
When you follow The Rager, the money is outrageous
Look at me, I'm legally selling drugs in all these stages
Van Cleef & Arpels, has V in all bracelets
The keys and codes and I know where all the coffers are
We do not make mistakes here, we do not take breaks here
My son is like a work of art, his father is like Shakespeare
I did the impossible, I should use a cover here
A "c" in my chest, cocaine traffickers, come play here
The career is in the eighth march, nothing more to do but levitate
I'm David Blaine here, I could disappear, I swear
We have changed here, so what really changed here?
I'm still on the side of Ye HERE

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, I'm saying something, they want it the old way (yeah)
I'm down the block, the windows are so blurred (Yeah)
Never said, "I can't", my bro, at all (at all)
Every time we go crazy, this is rock n 'roll, baby
This is my story, and yes, you should pay me (uh)
I told her, "I'm not going to spend the night," she can hate me (no)
Life is where it has been, where not, it is so crazy
Every time we go crazy, this is rock n 'roll, baby

We are the only group at risk
I'm playing live, fuck your hits
Touch the skies when you are rich
Each release makes them go crazy
I would have directed every six
I would have made each wrist shine
Each plot has a turnaround, when you sink a warship
I'm confused by your list
Who are you to convince?
All the mules I sent
What I lose?
I have caught these coins while I'm leaving the brick
I jumped for each level, Super Mario exists
All spoons that were folded, all smoke by the openings
I don't care what they do, that's not it, that's not that
I'm the traffic, I'm the solution, I'm the broker, I'm the Joker
In the deck, Arthur Fleck, when he's pissed off, triple six

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I accepted your lie
Every time, selfish, thinking that you were mine
I appeared, then you arrived, I thought it could turn the game
How do I get Chi ', I come to you and almost die?
Finally I'm tired of coming and going
I didn't come to get the kids to fight
I'm leaving all the time, showing me all the time
Pushing me to the limit, I don't know if I'm falling or flying
How many nights do I pray, how many times?
No matter what we say, God will decide, God will decide
Call the divine, the stars will align, the stars will align themselves
I love my mother, but sometimes my father was right
Take his hand, hold with all his strength
When you are lost in the light, call the light
Follow the signs, walk in the shine
[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
See, I'm wasting time
See, I really want to live my life, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more
See me try, Yeah, oh, that never dries, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more

[Output: Beyoncé]
If I have nothing -
If I have nothing -
One more, one more, one more
One more, one more, one more equals two
If I have nothing -
If I have nothing -
One more, one more, one more
One more, one more, one more equals two -embed
