Tonight lyrics [lyrics of "tonight" ft. Alonzo]

[Verse 1: ninho]
She saw the sole (she saw the sole), red is the signal (red is the signal)
Stop on image, aboard the boat, there are only pirates (there are only pirates)
There are only pirates (there are only pirates), there are only Jack Sparrow (Jack Sparrow)
Seven, eight, double p (p), you know of j à l'érot (from j à l'Tarrot)
We send, we are ready (we are ready), it's my pocket that speaks for me (my place)
Anyway (huh), if there is one left (huh), we will reject them in the cellar (the cellar)
The 'Teille is the size of my brava (brava), ah, tonight, it's serious, huh (serious, huh)
And if it drools, I have the firecracker, it's your team that will speak Latin
[Pre-refrain: Ninho & Alonzo]
We Carré V.I.P. not us? (We Carré V.I.P. not us?)
Are we ten bottles not? (We don't have twenty bottles?)
Don't we send us? (We don't send us?)
We don't do Mala us?

[Refrain: Ninho]
Tonight, we are us, we, we,
Tonight, it is us (that we), we (that we), us (that we)

All eyez me like 2pac (ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2: Alonzo]
A vandal dance, vandal, like Van Damme
I Pécho des Kendall, Kendall, you: that slab
I take it for an idiot and you sing my song
I see that touches the bottom, me, the ceiling
What is the one called next to it (who)? Tell him to call the one next to it (who?)
Settle, put yourself on the aisle
The team is equipped it will be decapitated (oh)
