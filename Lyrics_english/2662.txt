Living Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
The milk truck hauls the sun up
The paper hits the door
The subway shakes my floor
And I think about you
Time to face the dawning grey
Of another lonely day
It's so hard living without you

[Chorus]
It's so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard living without you
[Verse 2]
Everyone's got something
They're trying to get some more
They got something to get up for
But I ain't about to
Nothin's gonna happen
Nothin's gonna change
It's so hard living without you

[Chorus]
It's so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard living without you

[Outro]
So hard
So hard
So hardYou might also likeEmbed
