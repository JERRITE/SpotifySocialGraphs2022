Joke’s on You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drag me to death like a lit cigarette
Took my last breath like the smoke from my lips
I've lied for you and I liked it too
But my knees are bruised from kneeling to you
I've had enough, but you're too hard to quit
We've had our fun, now your sugar makes me sick
I've lied for you and I liked it too
But my makeup's ruined

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm laughing through my tears
I'm crying through my fear
But, baby, if I had to choose
[Chorus]
The joke's on you
The joke's on you
God knows I've tried to be kind
But I won't just lay down and die
Wearing a fake smile
The joke's on you

[Verse 2]
My heart's gone bad, now it won't beat for you
You had your laugh, now I won't play the fool
I've lied for you and I liked it too
But I'm black and blue from bleeding for you
You struck the match, burned me out so fast
Look what we had, now it's turned to ash
I've lied for you and I liked it too
But my makeup's ruined

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm laughing through my tears
I'm crying through my fear
But, baby, if I had to choose

[Chorus]
The joke's on you
The joke's on you
God knows I've tried to be kind
But I won't just lay down and die
Wearing a fake smile
The joke's on youYou might also like10Embed
