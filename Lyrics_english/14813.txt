Swallowed Lyrics[Verse 1]
Warm sun feed me up
I'm leery loaded up
Loathing for a change
And I slip some, boil away

[Chorus 1]
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet
[Verse 2]
Just wanna be myself
Hey you said you would love to try some
Hey you said you would love to die some
In the middle of a world on a fish hook
You're the wave, you're the wave, you're the wave

[Chorus 2]
Swallowed, borrowed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, hollowed
Sharp about everyone but yourself
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet

[Verse 3]
Piss on self-esteem
Forward busted knee
Sick head, blackened lungs
And I'm a simple selfish son

[Chorus 3]
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything but my love
Swallowed, oh no
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not
I'm with everyone and yet not

Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here
Got to get away from here

[Outro 2]
I miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lot
I miss the one that I love a lot1Embed
