Lyrics monotony ["monotony" letter]]

[Intro]
OH-OH-OH, Yeh
(You will live forever)
OH-OH-OH, Baby, Yeh

[Verse]
My life is now based on monotony
My mind reproduces days where I had
And although I asked you not to release my hand
Your fingers were soft like a piano keys
I still do not get used to it and that has passed time
But there is no way to overcome it
My mind is already aware and this suggests (OH)
To my heart that erases you but he does not want (huh)
He begs me and says he dies (huh)
Give time to time and not accelerate it
But it refuses to start from scratch
I don't care to wait for seven sights
Notebook and pen, I dedicate another day (OH-OH)
I look at the photo on the wall of how you smile (Yeh-eh)
Maybe it's an oversight, if it is improper
The penalty is my favorite uniform
I need to see you at Christmas use my coat
God asks me to be patient, one day I will go with you
Where smiles are entry cards
Where you can fly free and not cut your wings
More or less similar to a fairy tale
But this is better because life does not end
Who have I cheated on being happy?
If my happiness is only next to you
You are in a place where flowers take you
Where they no longer feel sorrows and fears
Where one smiles if they say I love you
My comfort is knowing that you went to heaven
Maybe your body is surrounded by more people
You are in a place where you no longer feel
After a while nobody has you present
I swear that if it's for me, you will live forever
[Outro]
OH-OH-OH, Yeh
(You will live forever)
OH-OH-OH, Baby, Yeh
This is a real -life story
When you lose the love of your life
You can't recover it
(I loved you, be happy)
