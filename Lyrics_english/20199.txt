​you were my love, then you left Lyrics[Chorus: cøzybøy]
You were a smile inside my head (Inside my head)
You were a gun loaded on my bed
You promised me that we'd never end (We'd never end)
You were my love then you left

[Verse: Thomas Reid]
I don't know how to keep chasing you, love, my legs are growing tired
I don't know if could chase one more drink, love, my cup is getting full
And now I'm running back running back
Wondering if you're coming back coming back
I've been running til my legs break
I'll hit the floor, it's all going black
Now I'm lying here on the pavement
Wondering where it all went wrong
I don't know where it went wrong
Where'd it all go so wrong
[Chorus: cøzybøy]
You were a smile inside my head (Inside my head)
You were a gun loaded on my bed
You promised me that we'd never end (We'd never end)
You were my love then you left

[Outro: Thomas Reid & cøzybøy]
I don't know how to keep chasing you, love, my legs are growing tired
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
I don't know how to keep chasing you love my legs are growing tired
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
'Cause I just want you to love me
You to love meYou might also likeEmbed
