Sweet Carita Lyrics [Lyrics for "Dulce Carita" FT. Zion & Lennox]

[Pre-car]
Yesterday I met her today I feel that I love her, ehh ehh (woo ohh ohh)
I fall in love, his mouth, his eyes, his hair, ohh (wooo ohh)
And I was looking at her, she realized and looked at me
With that I was dreaming all night

[Chorus]
Oh what a pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh
What a pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh
[Verse 1]
I see it on the album, Wonder Woman as shines
'Tá that stilla, girl when dancing is guilla
She who, formerly dead that simple (chair) huh
Before dead than simple
Sexy girl, sexy
Unbelievable sexy
He has an I know that, that anyone becomes crazy
Supernatural body
Sensational tropical beauty
(Awake puts me to dream)
Sweet Carita Caramelo de Sugar Bombón
Temptation aroma that causes addiction
I swear if I could want to steal
Even if it is a piece of your heart-shade
Even if they accuse me of a thief
Even if they lock me for life
Perpetual chain in prison
I swear if I could want to steal
Even a piece of your heart

[Chorus]
You have to pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh
What a pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh

I am inspired to write songs like this
(Songs like this)
I like it, she is almost perfect
It is certainly the soul of the party
Very sweet when dances
All men would like to try their nectar
LEONA loose when it manifests
I would do my best to be my girla
How many words are there, to describe it
I get your beauty so hard that it impacts
I met her yesterday and today I can't forget her
I capture its beauty I can't forget it
I get very sweet when you dance
When he dances, when he dances
I would do my best to be my girla

Yesterday I met her today I feel that I love her, ehh ehh (woo ohh ohh)

And I was looking at her, she realized and looked at me
With that I was dreaming all night

[Chorus]
Oh what a pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh
What a pretty woman
What a beautiful baby
His sweet face
It's very special makes me sigh
