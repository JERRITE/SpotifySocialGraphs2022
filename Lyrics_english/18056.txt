AUGUST IS A FEVER Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in the parking lot
For the second time today, I'm
Thinking if I run away I'll change my name
To one that feels like mine
We listen to the same four songs
This town is closing in on me
Sometimes I forget to breathe
Not sure if it's subconsciously, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you like to say that you got it figured out
But I don't know
No, I don't know
Where the hell I'm gonna go
And I'm aware
That you found a place to hide
But I don't know
No, I don't know
How to make it out alive
[Chorus]
And oh, oh
August is a fever
'Cause we're too hot and cold and homesick all the time
And oh, oh
I don't wanna leave ya
So I'll pack my things and leave myself behind
[Verse 2]
There's always too much time to kill
I never pull the trigger like I plan
We wait until the moon gets high then cross that line
Electric while we can
You like to fill your lungs with smoke
I feel like I'm just stuck between your teeth
Poison spilling down my throat
But New York's underwater in a week

[Pre-Chorus]
And you like to say that you got it figured out
But I don't know
No, I don't know
Where the hell I'm gonna go

[Chorus]
And oh, oh
August is a fever
'Cause we're too hot and cold and homesick all the time
And oh, oh
I don't wanna leave ya
So I'll pack my things and leave myself behind
You might also like[Bridge]
The party's burning down the house
We're drowning in your parents' pool
I think you're tryna smoke me out
Who let me think you're so cool? And
The party's burning down the house
We're drowning in your parents' pool
I think you're tryna smoke me out
Who let me think you're so fuckin' cool?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
August is a fever
'Cause we're too hot and cold and homesick all the time
Oh, oh
I don't wanna leave ya
So I'll pack my things and leave myself behind
Oh, oh
August is a fever
'Cause we're too hot and cold and homesick all the time
And oh, oh
I don't wanna leave ya
So I'll pack my things and leave myself behind

[Outro]
(I cannot wait for this to drop, you don't even know)1Embed
