Solo Lyrics ["Solo" letter]

[Intro]
(Yeih, Dalex)

[Pre-car]
I told you that I love you for my life
Baby, I found you when I was' lost
You thought it was a game when I told you

[Chorus]
You will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who diverted yourself
And you will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who diverted yourself
[Bridge]
And his time has passed
As I spend it for the club 'inside'
Upload photo 'With me, says "My Love"
You are happier, that to 'the world noticed it, since I arrived

[Verse 1]
I gave it a weight 'pa' to spend
The Mercedes Tinti'a that I finished buying you
This outside Parque√° ', so that you are going to border on (border)
Do not worry, that nothing will be missing

[Bridge]
And his time has passed
As I spend it for the club 'inside'
Upload photo 'With me, says "My Love"
You are happier, that to 'the world noticed it, since I arrived

[Chorus]
You will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who diverted yourself
And you will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who deviates you (diverts, diverts)

I told you that I love you for my life
Baby, I found you when I was' lost
You thought it was a game when I told you (-Hey, -how)

[Chorus]
You will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who diverted yourself
And you will never be alone, alone
'Toms with me and my gun, or
That with you no longer fucks, fuck
That now I am the one who diverted yourself

[Bridge]
And his time has passed
How to cut the 'inside' the club
Upload photo 'With me, says "My Love"
Who is happier, that to 'the world noticed it, uh-yeh
