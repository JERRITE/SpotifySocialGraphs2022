Worthy of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would take a bullet
And you wouldn’t even notice
Til' the sirens come
And I will build a palace
But I know you’d probably rather just
A room for one
And I know
I never keep my promises
But you’re the one I’m breaking them for
So what’s the use in all this if
[Chorus]
I’ll never be worthy of you
I’m broken, and beat up, and bruised
I’ve proven all that I can prove
There’s nothing that I won’t do
But I’ll never be worthy of you, yeah

[Verse 2]
You could watch me drown
But I’d be six feet underground before you realize
And I’d go clinically insane just to meet all your expectations
Yeah, I’d lose my mind
And I know that I’m not always innocent
But every sin, I did it for you
So what’s the use in all of this if

[Chorus]
I’ll never be worthy of you
I’m broken, and beat up, and bruised
I’ve proven all that I can prove
There’s nothing that I won’t do
But, I’ll never be worthy of you

[Bridge]
I’ve tried and I’ve tried
Pure sacrifice
So come with me
Fallin' and fallin'
Nowhere at all
What do you want from me? Yeah
I’m broken and beat up and bruised
I’ve proven all that I can prove
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
You might also like[Chorus]
I’ll never be worthy of you
I’m broken, and beat up, and bruised
I’ve proven all that I can prove
There’s nothing that I won’t do
But, I’ll never be worthy of you

[Outro]
Worthy of you
I’ll never be worthy of you3Embed
