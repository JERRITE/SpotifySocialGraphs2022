Lyricsay details, I don't know how to start
No, I do not know
Dream, grow, start
Take the step

Oh, I don't know how to start
No, I do not know
Dream, grow, start
Take the step

Share my desire to help others
Give myself to this fresh and new opportunity
Work with illusion, firmness and respect
The light of my conscience that fills me with peace
Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Escape time and live without fear
Contemplate life and its mystery '
Listen to silence and get lost inside
Find Wind whisper responses

Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Project my joy and observe
And release my mind
Feel clearly

And of the present enjoy

Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Opening the eye '
Look at the details
Awakening my sense '
Melt with the air

Melt with the air
Melt with the air

Oh, I don't know
