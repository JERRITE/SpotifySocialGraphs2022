I'm for him lyrics with the street full of dead leaves
With my shadow I go down the sidewalks without seeing
Zombi half in automatic
The rain falls on my head
But I don't loosen my ideas, no
To the warehouse where I keep the sorrows
There is no room for one more (I'm for him)
Although they open the doors they don't leave

Faithful, to the same mar
That there are in my bones, in one thousand percent
I am for him
I sigh in silence, jealousy scratches me
I am for him
On the night of the year
You told me while we danced, no
I never wanted anyone like you
Upon the day we walk
Together from the hand and kissed
As if only a second
Before the world made explosion (I'm for him)
Everything was little so desperate

Faithful, to the same mar
That there are in my bones, in one thousand percent
I am for him
I sigh in silence, jealousy scratches me
I am for him

Spring and then summer
They were many ever (never ever)
What a night on that day that was declared

Faithful, to the same mar
That there are in my bones, in one thousand percent
I am for him
I sigh in silence, jealousy scratches me
I am for him

Waiting faithful
With all loaded and tense nerves
In case you want to go back
I sigh in silence, dying of fear
I am for him
Waiting faithful
With all loaded and tense nerves
In case you want to go back
I sigh in silence, dying of fear
I am for him
Waiting faithful
With all loaded and tense nerves
In case you want to go back
I sigh in silence, dying of fear
I am for him
You might also like him for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for him
I am for Ã‰lembed
