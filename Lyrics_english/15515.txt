PENDING ACCOUNT LYRICSLETRA OF "PENDING ACCOUNT" FT. Alejandro Sanz

[English Translation]

[Intro: Paty Cantú and Alejandro Sanz]
Mmm, ah
Don't complain, don't complain
Ahhh
Huh, huh, eh

[Verse 1: Paty Cantú]
Of the temptations that I have
I would swear that you are the best
I prefer that I give me a kiss to deny your heart
[Pre-Caro: Alejandro Sanz]
Damn the desire I have to see you
And that you rain on my desert
There are both an outstanding account
What do you think if we fix that?

[Chorus: Paty Cantú and Alejandro Sanz]
Oh, take me a little while to paradise
Put the stars on the floor
There is not so much commitment, without obligation
Remember that I have a dangerous mind
And tonight you look like a goddess
The thing is getting good, oh, the thing

[Post-Coro: Both]
I like I like
You have something that I like
I like I like
You have something that I like

[Verse 2: Paty Cantú]
You are the sin of the earth that my body needs
Remove the penalty and forgive, but first the shirt

[Pre-Caro: Alejandro Sanz]
Damn the desire I have to see you
That you rain on my desert
There are both an outstanding account
What do you think if we fix that?
