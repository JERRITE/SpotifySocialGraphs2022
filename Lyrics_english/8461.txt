Again Remix Lyrics [Enter: Frl]
A PICAZZO brush design you
In trending your figure is rankeo
For the others one threat
Tell me what's happening
I want to see you, I want to have you


[Chorus: osmerlin]
And I want to see you
To you baby again
And again and again
I want to have you
[Chorus: Eiespy]
And I want to see you
To you baby again
And again and again
I want to have you

[See 1: Osmerlin]
Is that you beautiful
My baby
Let me give you a kiss
In the mouth

Good face
But it's Malita
I know this is going to be
Your favorite song

Tell me babi what are we going to do
You remember all that I see you to pick you up
And your mother always calling you to the cell
She without knowing
That you are my sweet honey

Then it will lead you to eat ice cream
Of novel with his braided hair
The gold that Columbus had sought
I find you and navigated

I keep seeing your reflexes in my mind
I would give what was mommy to see you again

Is that in my life I have you present
And it hurts me to know that I can't have you

Let's do that possible
Because living without you has become impossible to me
Mami of me do not forget you
That for you I can become incredible

There are the two of rumba
I take you for the hotel and we lose control
If you want my kisses I give it to you and then slowly make love you
There are the two of rumba
I take you for the hotel and we lose control
If you want my kisses I give it to you and then slowly make love you


[Chorus: Oscarlyn Garcia]
And I want to see you
To you baby again
And again and again
I want to have you
[Chorus: Frl]
And I want to see you
To you baby again
And again and again
I want to have you

[See 3: Oscarlyn Garcia]
I know you try to hide it
But when we are together you can't deny it
I get wrong with just thinking about it
That there is little to see you, I can't assimilate it

Panas tell me not to softe
Knowing that you are the feeling of the block
With the look does not cause her
But it would not bother her that without wanting I touch her

And you know what I feel
I have waited for this moment
I want to see you dance very soft and slow
Very soft and slow

Dare
Give it to be mommy that dien the 12
Keep it lowkey here does nobody know me
Give it to enjoy it

[See 4: FRL]
We have temptations you and me
We do not want relationships both
I see your face and naughty
Sensual, malicious and flirtatious

She is my baby who likes
It's like Celia has her sugar
She is my goddess I call her my Athens
The baby is hard ta â€™novel

You have me not want to force it
I love you
Duo Killer as in the Fortnite
So let's play, here in my bed

You have me not want to force it
I love you
Duo Killer as in the Fortnite
So let's play, here in my bed

[Chorus: osmerlin]
And I want to see you
To you baby again

[Chorus: Eiespy]
And again and again
I want to have you

[Chorus: Oscarlyn Garcia]
And I want to see you
To you baby again

[Chorus: Frl]
And again and again
I want to have you1embed
