Smile For Me Lyrics[Intro: Loon]
Now mami, it's all about Loon and Massari
It ain't about SL5's and Ferrari's
It ain't about platinum ice by bvlgari
Shots of Patron, pineapple juice Bacardi
I need you to smile for me, movin' your body
It's gettin' late mami, what time we leavin' the party?
I'm gettin' restless, almost time for breakfast
Chicks is reckless so I'm headin' towards the exit

[Verse 1: Massari]
Ladies know me im a charma
So most of these girls that would be on me
Maybe because they know That I'm a balla
Thousand dolla bottles in the VIP
Plus i had enough of the drama
All of these honeys that would be on me
If you wanna lemme hear ya holla
And then if you wanna could you call on me?
[Pre-Chorus: Massari]
Baby could you be down for me
Could you be around for me (Im a lover)
It really don't matter ohh you gotta just smile for me
Baby could you be down for me
Could you be around for me (Im a lover)
It really don't matter ohh you gotta just smile for me

[Chorus: Massari]
You know you gotta (wha?)
Just make it hotter (ohh!)
Im stackin' dollars
Ain't no more drama for me
You know you gotta (wha?)
Just make it hotter (ohh!)
Im stackin' dollars
Ain't no more drama for me

[Bridge: Loon]
C'mon, uou know you gotta
Just make it hotter
Loon, Massari
Let's Go

[Verse 2: Loon]
What's the sense brushin your teeth when your not gon smile
I know I'm a bad boy but I'm not that wild
I might hang out late but I'm not that foul
These chicks be on my back like they got my child
Meanwhile you know my style, I'm high profile
Even though I be in the hood where the gats go bloa!
I got stacks and pals, rowin catsters wow, actin here ma thats not your style
I can tell by the Chanel you livin it well
But you ain't used to dealin with cats that livin in hell
Used to catch tryin to get in your tell, cats sniff your trail, stocky boots why you walkin those heels
Kinda ill how you makin it hotter in your Gucci and Prada
You the reason why a groupie you nada
Nigga never get seen in Nevada, sippin pina colada, not with me momma nah uh. (you you you gotta)

You know you gotta (wha?)
Just make it hotter (ohh!)

You know you gotta (wha?)
Just make it hotter (ohh!)
Im stackin' dollars
Ain't no more drama for me

[Verse 3: Massari]
Im comin in Gucci and Parda
And then they lookin when they pass by me
When they run up they run up they wanna holla
And they only thing that i say is "Hey Mami"
Then i invited shorty to a bottle
She said she didn't drink VSOP
So then i opened up another bottle
After that i took her home with me

[Pre-Chorus: Massari]
Baby could you be down for me
Could you be around for me (Im a lover)
It really don't matter ohh you gotta just smile for me
Baby could you be down for me
Could you be around for me (Im a lover)
It really don't matter ohh you gotta just smile for me
