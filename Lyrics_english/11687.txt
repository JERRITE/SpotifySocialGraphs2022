Techno Show Lyrics[Verse 1]
I really don't wanna go
Be at that techno show
It's not like me to go and watch
Some guy spin a bass drop

[Chorus]
I'm off it though
And about to say I'm for that bass
With you here, it seems okay
For me to be out of place in this dank room
Man I'm just screwed
[Verse 2]
I didn't know how to be
And got lit out of my tree
You saw me there at the back
And waved me up to come and dance

[Chorus]
I'm off it though
And about to say I'm for that bass
With you here, it seems okay
For me to be out of place in this dank room
Man I'm just screwed

[Bridge]
I'm off it though
And about to say
I'm for that bass

[Chorus]
I'm off it though
And about to say I'm for that bass
With you here, it seems okay
For me to be out of place in this dank room
Man I'm just screwed

Then lost it all, in a laugh
Then Adrienne, lit me up
You might also likeI've had enough to drink
To last me til next week
But it's so dark inside this club I can't see
How far I'm past done3Embed
