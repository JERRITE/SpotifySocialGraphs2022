To You Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cried out, to you alone
What's in you? Throw me a bone
Oh life, what did you know?
How do we ever decide?

[Verse 2]
Careful love, blow it away
Let's go there, what do you say?
Oh life, why did we wait
How do we get to the sky?
[Verse 3]
Called out, to you alone
What made you? Maybe you know
Oh life, let it all go
How do we get to the sky?You might also likeEmbed
