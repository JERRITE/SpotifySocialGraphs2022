Let’s Ride Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin]
Come on in and lean close babe
As I sing you this bonfire song
Close your eyes and hear the waves
Imagine what you’d see with your Nikon on

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Planning this trip for days now
Thinking of things that I want to do
Hop in the passenger seat now
Come on girl let me show you the view
[Verse 1: Justin]
Tiki bars, lit up hard
Glamourous beach bum movie stars
Grab the girl that could steal my heart
Dance all night to acoustic guitar

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew]
It's a steel drum romance
You had me at first glance
Spin you around like dance, dance
Hop in the backseat

[Chorus: Andrew and Justin]
And Let’s Ride
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight

[Verse 2: Justin]
You and me, headed down by the beach
We can kick it down south in the Florida Keys
We can cast a line, we can drink a beer
Dance all night like we don’t care

One hand on the Grady White
Isla Morada summertime
Goin' to the sandbar for the night
I see the sunset in your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Andrew]
It's a steel drum romance
You had me at first glance
Spin you around like dance, dance
Hop in the backseat

[Chorus: Andrew and Justin]
And Let’s Ride
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight

[Bridge: Justin]
Hop in the back of my truck, and we’ll be poppin’ bottles all night long
Reminiscing all the days, spent by fires on a mountain
Burning down the nights, dancing flames, watching smoke spin
Come on, come on, baby

[Bridge: Justin and Andrew]
We could have a little fun
Drinking in the summer
We get a little drunk
Kissing whiskey off your lips in the sun
The moment was won
And the bottle never runs dry
[Chorus: Andrew and Justin]
And Let’s Ride
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight
Come on baby, Let’s Ride
Leave it all behind tonight

[Outro: Andrew]
Come on in and lean close babe
As I sing you this bonfire song
Close your eyes and hear the waves
Imagine what you’d see with your Nikon onEmbed
