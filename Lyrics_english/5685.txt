Old Soul (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look at the fire as it burns out
Look at the time, where are you now?
I wanna be there when you get cold
You know

[Chorus]
I'm an old soul
You're an old soul
We are dreamers
I believe in us
[Verse 2]
Look at our love as it grows old
Who would've thought it was pure gold
I wanna be there when it's set in stone

[Chorus]
I'm an old soul
You're an old soul
We are dreamers
I believe in us

[Bridge]
I was scared
So unprepared for me
To fall in love
You were there
You were where I found
My freedom

[Chorus]
I'm an old soul
You're an old soul
We are dreamers
I believe in us

Old, old soul
Old, old soul
You might also like[Outro]
I'm an old soul
You're an old soulEmbed
