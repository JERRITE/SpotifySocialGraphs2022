TranslationEnglishla Half Lyrics ["half" letter "]

[Verse 1: Camilo]
Yes for things of destiny
One day you and I said goodbye
Oh, I don't know what I would eat
Or what would laugh
Because the world without you does not imagine

[Verse 2: Christian nodal]
Yes for life things
The man who finally deserved
And if he is your soulmate
I take off even if it hurts me
And up to two or three tips would give him
[Pre-car: Camilo]
Do not worry about me
I would fix them
To change my head for another other than mine
And not think about you, no longer thinking about you

[Chorus: Christian Nodal & Camilo]
And although they give you twice as
And the triple kisses I gave you
And although they give you 21 roses a day
And a thousand times say they die for you
Oh, if they give you all that I take off my hat
But nobody is going to love you half
Of what I love you

[Instrumental interlude]

[Pre-Caro: Christian Nodal]
Do not worry about me
I would fix them
To change my head for another other than mine
And not think about you, no longer thinking about you

[Chorus: Camilo & Christian Nodal]
And although they give you twice as
And the triple kisses I gave you
And although they give you 21 roses a day
And a thousand times say they die for you
Oh, if they give you all that I take off my hat
But nobody is going to love you half
Of what I love you
From what I want to have you might also likembed
