Hang in There Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
Today's all burnt toast
Running late and dad jokes
"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"
Close my eyes, take a bite
Grab a ride, laugh out loud
There it is up on the roof

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, I survived
So just take my advice
[Chorus]
Hang in there, baby
Things are crazy
But I know your future's bright
Hang in there, baby
There's no maybe
Everything turns out alright
Sure, life is up and down
But trust me, it comes back around
You’re gonna love who you turn out to be

[Verse 2]
Woo!
Home run, loud crash
Someone’s gonna pay for that
Why's everyone looking at me?
Trouble in paradise
Skating on melted ice
Please don't take away my TV

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, I survived
So just take my advice

[Chorus]
Hang in there, baby
Things are crazy
But I know your future's bright
Hang in there, baby
There's no maybe
Everything turns out alright
Sure, life is up and down
But trust me, it comes back around
You’re gonna love who you turn out to be

Someone who gets along
Can keep you moving on
That's what I’m here for
Say anything, you can say anything
'Cause I've been there

[Chorus]
Hang in there, baby
Things are crazy
But I know your future's bright
Hang in there, baby
There's no maybe
Everything turns out alright
Sure, life is up and down
But trust me, it comes back around
You’re gonna love who you turn out to be

[Chorus]
Hang in there, baby
Things are crazy
But I know your future's bright
Hang in there, baby
There's no maybe
Everything turns out alright
Sure, life is up and down
But trust me, it comes back around
You’re gonna love who you turn out to be
[Outro]
Take it from me
Hang in there, baby5Embed
