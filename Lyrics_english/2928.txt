Ashanti, Terror, Terror Squad
It must be about us, be about confidence
[Hook: Ashanti & (Ja Rule)]

What is love ? It must be about us, it must be about baby confidence
What is love ?

[Verse 1: fat joe]
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Woo! Yeah, slowed down, baby
I let you know from the start that I would not lower myself baby
I want a chick with my strong hips that licks my lips
It can be of the office type or affectionate the striptease
Girl you pruned me when you look at me in the eyes
But you talk too much, I swear you make me go down perched
I don't want to lose this feeling because my head is stir
It's on fire and you look ready to receive
I am, a vagabond, that this stupid under a hood or a linen canvas
A provider, I have to see jewelry on my women
And I take advantage of it, the squad remains filing the 4x4
With chicks who want to make a trip with us, Uh
You say that you have a man and that you are in love
But what has love to do with a small household at three
After the little jumping, you and me
I could just slide for a moment and she could enjoy too
This is love!

[Verse 2: fat joe]
Yeah, uh - yeah .. yo, uh, yo
Little woman I know you have some concerns; you have a boyfriend
But you must understand that you have something with you
Your ass is fatty, your pride is small
Tattoo on your chest with his name in the middle, Uh
I'm not a jealous I just flirt a lot
And the way you shake your ass I don't want you to stop
You need to approach me a little .. (approach a little)
And let me put you, under my arms come a gift is supposed to do it
Please believe it, you go out with me
We will strive overnight as if we are under ecstasy
You have to trust the god and jumped into the car
For a little hard eight game at the Casino Taj Mahal
What is love ?

[Verse 3: fat joe]
Yeah, uh, yo
Yo I gamba in the Night Club with my lowered hat
From the Michael Jackson style, I dance sexy tell me who is the mac now?
It's not my fault because he likes the kid that I am
It would be the chain or the box, I don't know what it is
We are just partying and absurdities, come and the lady
Put your body in motion, you attracted a black
You came here with the heart of deceiving
So you have to sing the song with me
All my ladies let's go there

[Pont: Ashanti & (Ja Rule)]
When I look at you in the eyes there is nothing that stops me
I want Don Joey Crack, above me (Uh-Huh)
I don't want your tickets to just break my back (yeah)
I won't be soft, because I'm in it like that (Uh, Woo, Uh)
Go (yeah yeah all you)
And put everything (yeah yeah all) on me (put everything on your girl)
On me (I'm going to get on you girl)
