Winners Lyrics [Winners' words "]

[Verse]
Twelve years that I am in rap, I am not surpassed
Don't worry, I go out my eyes if I see your sister pass
It rolls stunned joints, just to forget the past
I have too much broken heart, I forget my ex i'm going to hunt
The future of rap is me, I'm going to all shlass
Big breeding leaf firecracker, I like beautiful all shaved women
You recognized the phrasing, in a refreshment bar or gas
I come away from an Angelina, to move, to make sure
Motherfuck generation like Mortadon I am the time
Live from FONT GREEN, I wake up in the song of 'roosters'
2013, I shock you, Malamadré puts you in cleansing
Stop your rap is knock, I have lots of rockets in stock
I knew the galley, not one to go see a crazy
Not one to put my tn or put a brother in a jail
For my cassos' which spit the jogging
For nothing it comes out the kalash, i ain't joking
Jul Hop The King, Mc goes on the ring
Don't be hot in the box it will be in the parking lot
You have to double but by whom? Home jacking
Motorcycle khaki jacket, confuse it strikes like jackie
We want the ball to Shaki ', two million, a liner
I saw you go to club so with me do not the beautiful
Liga One is the base, you know who is the Winners
Brush we can slide at the Teddy Riner
A finger to the bouncers, who are playing
I am weak like every man, I escape under flash or hashish
In the tièk 'the cops are hidden, want to make our life of the mess
How many friends in the dungeon? All alone in crisis, waiting for a hot meal
Tonight I'm angry I do anti-facho sound
In Salon, Luynes, Fleury Prison Pourie
There's hate that sits behind the smiles
Do not make the sun on you there are all the eyes of the city
Respect to you if you have turned out of necessity
Your balls if you are, not a poto that has to encourage
I came to fart the rap, there I came to recycle it
It rises in cyclo, Charbonne even under cyclone
It doesn’t get a firecracker, no, it scratches six cigarettes
It rolls without a license because in code you made six faults there
I tear your garter on it if in front of me you scrapped
Total and Kalif there at my shoulder, Soso Maness the new Écoleyou Might Also Like8embed
