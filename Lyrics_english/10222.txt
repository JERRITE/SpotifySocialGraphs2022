Miracles Lyrics[Verse 1]
Should I take one more step?
Should I wait and regret?
Fall behind and live half alive?
Should I leap off the edge?
Breathing in, hold my breath
Take a dive, dive into the light

[Chorus]
Because I believe in something more
More than miracles, more than miracles
Oh, I believe in something more
More than miracles, more than miracles
[Post-Chorus]
I need you now
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now

[Verse 2]
Should I find my own way?
Should I stop, hit the brakes?
Keep in line and live half alive? (Half alive)
Should I force playing safe?
Should I fight, seize the day?
Take dive, dive into the night

[Chorus]
Because I believe in something more
More than miracles, more than miracles
Oh, I believe in something more
More than miracles, more than miracles

[Post-Chorus]
I need you now
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now

I need you now
I need you now

[Chorus]
Because I believe in something more (Something more)
More than miracles, more than miracles
Oh, I believe in something more (Something more)
More than miracles, more than miracles

[Post-Chorus]
I need you now (Need your love, I need your love)
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now (Need your love, I need your love)
'Cause it's merely only you and me
I need you now1Embed
