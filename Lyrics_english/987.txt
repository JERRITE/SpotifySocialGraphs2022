Equal or worse lyrics [letter of "equal or worse"]

[Saying: Dalex, Gigolo, both]
You told me (UH-YEH), that you would not be the same
You ended up being worse
(Hello daddy, trust me, please believe me, daddy)
Bubu
You lied and I thought that with you was going to be much better
(Daddy, Hello, do you listen to me?)
But-
[Chorus: Dalex, Gigolo, both]
You ended up doing what you were not going to do (no, no)
Infidelity you were faithful (unfaithful)
You no longer have that paper (paper)
Because you ended up doing what you were not going to do
Infidelity you were faithful (faithful)
You no longer have that paper (paper)
Because you ended up doing what—

[Verse 1: gigolo]
With another man, in another bed
And I think he still loves me '
Tell me your name, what is your name?
You are not going to find another just like me in bed
Did what he said would not, I thought you
Never say, look now, who would say
I took you with the 'hand' in the dough
For trusting so much look what happens
You changed China for bottle '
For later commit the bottle '
That is why I say that: "He who does it for"
Bubu

[Bridge: Dalex]
And that's why I threw my friend (what?)
That she tells you (well, why did you do that to me?)
How I ate it (ate)

Because you ended up doing what you were not going to do (do)
Infidelity you were faithful (unfaithful)
You no longer have that paper (paper)
Because you ended up doing what you were not going to do
Infidelity you were faithful (unfaithful)
You no longer have that paper (paper)
Because you ended up doing— (doing)

[Verse 2: Exce]
You believe you that with yours you got out
From the 'do', you were the one you lost
And did not forgive mistakes if you made them
Because I am like time if you lost me (in truth ')
Take a passage pa'l fuck (pa'l caajo)
And if you want to pay you
The world is round, in another life does not 'find'
Follow your path that I continue hesitation (ah-ah; the e ')
The shit ate it
The last thing you said was the first thing you did
You can die for me

[Saying: the exceed]
You told me that you wouldn't be the same
You ended up being worse
And for you, you listed me
I thought with you was going to be much better (haha)
But not
[Bridge: Dalex]
And that's why I threw my friend (friend)
That she tells you (say)
How I ate it (ate)

[Outro: Dalex & lace]
Because you ended up doing what— (what)
The towers
The e'
And since you don't leave you, 'I never leave (I never leave)
Ask your friend, tell him to tell you
Dalex
