Dangerous (Oliver Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
How could you know, how could you know
That those were my eyes?
Peepin' through the floor, it’s like they know
It’s like they know I’m looking from the outside
And creepin' to the door, it’s like they know
And now they're coming, yeah, now they're coming
Out from the shadows
To take me to the court because they know
Gotta shut this down
'Cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the warrant 'cause they know
[Chorus]
You understand I got a plan for us
I bet you didn’t know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn’t know that I was dangerous

[Post-Chorus]
(Danger)

[Verse 2]
How could they know, how could they know
What I've been thinking?
Like they’re right inside my head because they know
Because they know, what I've been hiding
They’re right under my bed, they’re on patrol
Here they come, yeah, here they come
Out of the shadows
To take me to the court because they know
Gotta shut this down
'Cause they've been watching all my windows
They gathered up the warrant 'cause they know

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve gotta get out of here
Sink down, into the dark
(Keep on runnin')
And I’ve gotta get out of here (keep on runnin')
Sink down, into the dark
You might also like[Chorus]
You understand I got a plan for us
I bet you didn’t know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn’t know that I was dangerous

[Post-Chorus]
(Danger)
