Visitation of the Ghost Lyrics[Verse 1]
You think, you think you're pretty smart
But I can cause a little pain
She wraps the cord around her arm
Tries hard to find the little vein

[Chorus]
Oh, she lines the pictures in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost
[Verse 2]
You think that I don't know your game
A pretty, pretty, pretty little face
Despite every book and every little kiss you took
She'll take your place

[Chorus]
Oh, she lines the pictures, in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost

[Bridge]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... (Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... (Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... (Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... (Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord) Oh my Lord... Oh Lord...
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah!

[Chorus]
She lines the pictures in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost
Of the ghost! Ghost! Oh yeah!
She lines the picture in a pretty row
To create a circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
And if you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghostYou might also like4Embed
