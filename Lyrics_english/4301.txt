Point and coma lyricsmagnate)
What you and I have
It already has me confused
It's like that someone who reads
A meaningless prayer
He doesn't know when he ends
If in the end there is no fixed point
Love that does not stop him
Neither a comma nor a prefix

Choir: (x2)
And I don't know if you set an end point
What together we try to form
Or a coma for time to have
If you are able to believe that man
(Valentino)
And notice it in your gaze
You were the friend
That in good and bad
Next to me you were
Without realizing that you fell in love
(Magnate)
Of this man who told you
From amorios to bad features
To which you confess
As in bed it was that you gave yourself

(Valentino)

And destiny betrayed me
And I understood
I fall in love that I was about you
But through there was much to lose
I was her and you were still

(Magnate)
But a drunk night without thinking
You gave yourself and you let you love
The other day you left without talking
You just left a note without sign
You Might Also Like (Valentino)
He said:
"Thank you coma for what happens three points
And at the end of the paper a goodbye
I don't know if it was something new started
Or simply that everything ends here ... "

Chorus (x4)

Magnate and Valentino ....
Mario, this is lyrics
This is a topic ...
We alone, breaking the schemes ...
This is its limit ...
