Life is a Tragedy Lyrics[Intro: Brennan Savage]
Life is a tragedy
Is this shit reality?

[Chorus: Brennan Savage]
Life is a Tragedy
Is this shit reality?
Every single thing I touch I turn into a masterpiece
People say they love you when they hatin', this shit bad for me
Nobody can help, but watch my back for me
[Verse 1: Brennan Savage]
This ain't no act from me
I might give you all my love, just give that back to me
I'll buy you anything, I said I got them racks on me
See me and you know I'm 'bout to stunt
Everytime I play they want it back
Do it unless I spin the block
Everywhere I go I make it hot, I'm in the (?)
Bro, they has been shooting, using a motherfuckin' Glock
Either way, that's why you won't get shot
I'vе been working way too hard, I gotta give it all I've got
Yeah, my og told mе, money make you lonely
Gotta watch the opps, even gotta watch the homies
I feel pain, but I keep it on the low-key
If you feel me, baby, come and show me

[Bridge: Brennan Savage]
Show me something you ain't never seen
Speaking on my name, I'm finna see you in your dreams
I'm not gone all the way, I'm in between
You really gon' see what I mean

[Chorus: Brennan Savage]
Life is a Tragedy
Is this shit reality?
Every single thing I touch I turn into a masterpiece
People say they love you when they hatin', this shit bad for me
Nobody can help, but watch my back for me

Yeah, my og told me, money make you lonely
Gotta watch the opps, even gotta watch the homies
I feel pain, but I keep it on the low-key
If you feel me, baby, come and show me

[Outro: Brennan Savage]
Life is a Tragedy
Is this shit reality?
Every single thing I touch I turn into a masterpiece
People say they love you when they hatin', this shit bad for me
Nobody can help, but watch my back for me
Back for me, back for meEmbed
