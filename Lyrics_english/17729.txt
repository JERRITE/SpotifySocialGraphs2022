[Unique verse]
It is barbarism in Burberry (gang), I agree that I have an outdated heart (BRR)
I didn't see temporary (pah), I couldn't rhyme (pah)
I didn't see Driller (BRR), the patients saw me dealer
The patients saw me on the ground, to shoot down the enemy is the base
I see them cracked, they want my good, they want my share, they want my place (gang, brr)
Grinder, G13 in the mass, there are no gifts, even on a pass (there are no gifts, even on a pass)
You should know that the coal, it leads to jail (it leads to jail)
You finished loser yet you were on the motorcycle, wow
No bluff, no mytho (wow), tp, no half-time, gang
You have to ask all these people, I'm true, I'm not legendary (nan)
I meet LP, La Tour (La Tour), R. Herv√©, rue d'Holbach (Gang)
My debut of smoking in the building (brr, in the building), my first bad when I was in the evil (BRR)
The condes know that I am too much in too much the lease, I am involved, I give no blase
I am always attracted by plav '(gang, gang), it's the slab that speaks (it's the slab that speaks)
There are people who speak, there are people who speak but it is only noise (but it is only BRR)
They know us well, we do what we say, proofing in support (BRR)
I don't count on him, I don't count on you (pah), each his life (pah)
Many of me, I am twenty years old, I am the prince of the city (gang, gang)
I do not count on him (BRR), I do not count on you, each his life (each his life)
Many of me, I am twenty years old, I am the prince of the city (BRR)
Still in group, still in pack (PAH), there are always five in the box (always)
We avoid checks, it's better to get to the right address (it's better)
I can't turn my jacket (BRR), when it's hot, who is the size?
When is it hot, who's left? (When it's hot, who? BRR)
Gang
