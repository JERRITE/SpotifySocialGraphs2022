Sometimes (From ”Fire Island”) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You tell me you're in love with me
But you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight, treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight, treat you right
Be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight, treat you right
Be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight, treat you right (Treat you right)
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is timeEmbed
