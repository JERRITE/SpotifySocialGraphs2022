Cover You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm looking down from the edge like I'm taking in the view
Surrounded by so many people in a crowded room
But all I, all I see is you
You're a step away from falling, I'm a breath away from life
In the middle of the dark storm, we're standing in the eye
And all I, all I see is you

[Pre-Chorus]
All is fair in love and war
If what you see is what you want, fight for it
All is fair in love and war
If what you see is what you want, fight for it
[Chorus]
If we go in, yeah, you know that we ain't going back
I will cover you, if I know that you have my back
If we go in, yeah, you know that we ain't going back
I will cover you, I will, I will cover you

[Verse 2]
Look me in the eye, get it all out in the open
There's nothing left to hide, let's leave our skeletons behind tonight
Leave them all behind

[Pre-Chorus]
All is fair in love and war
If what you see is what you want, fight for it
All is fair in love and war
If what you see is what you want, fight for it

[Chorus]
If we go in, yeah, you know that we ain't going back
I will cover you, if I know that you have my back
If we go in, yeah, you know that we ain't going back
I will cover you, I will, I will cover you

[Outro]
I will cover you, I will, I will cover you
I will cover you, I will, I will cover youYou might also likeEmbed
