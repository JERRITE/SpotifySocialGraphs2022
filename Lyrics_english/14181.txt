You Donâ€™t Understand Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't understand me
But if the feeling was right
You might comprehend me
And why do you feel the need to tease me
Why don't you turn it around
It might be easier to please me

[Chorus]
And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me
And I know you
If nothing is true
[Verse 2]
What do you think that you are doing
But who is the fool, the fool or the fool
That you are fooling
And maybe I just don't see the reason
But in the court of my heart your ignorance is treason

[Chorus]
And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me
And I know you
If nothing is true

[Bridge]
You think you know how I feel
It's not that big of a deal
There's no such thing it's not real
Oh-Oh

[Verse 3]
You don't understand me
But if the feeling was right
You might comprehend me
And I don't claim to understand you
But I've been looking around
And I haven't found, anybody like you
You might also like[Chorus]
And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me
And I know you
If nothing is true4Embed
