Stranglehold Lyrics[Verse 1: Derek St. Holmes]
Here I come again now baby
Like a dog in heat
You tell it's me by the clamor now, baby
I like to tear up the street

[Chorus 1: Derek St. Holmes]
Now I've been smoking for so long
You know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You best get out of the way
[Solo 1]

[Verse 2: Derek St. Holmes]
Road I cruise is a bitch now baby
You know you can't turn me 'round
If a house gets in my way baby
You know I'll burn it down

[Chorus 2: Derek St. Holmes]
You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
Got you in a stranglehold now baby
Then I crushed your face

[Instrumental break 1:44-6:14]
[Guitar solo 2: Ted Nugent]

[Verse 3: Ted Nugent]
Sometimes you gonna get higher
Sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news you never got to go

[Bridge: Derek St. Holmes & Both]
Come on, come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on up
Come on come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on

You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold baby
And then I crushed your face2Embed
