Sail Away Lyrics[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah
Beach boy in this ho
Beach boy in this ho, ayy ayy

[Chorus]
It's the beach boy, baby, time to sail away
Time to sail away, oh-whoa
It's the beach boy, baby, here to save the day, yeah
Come on and sail away, ayy-yeah, look
[Refrain]
Shawty wan' say she act selfish
I want a new diamond necklace
I know I did you so wrong before
She say, "Yung Pinch, you so reckless"
I'm stuck in my ways, I can't help it
Lately I'm living like Elvis
I know you ain't mine no more, but
You can't be nobody else's, yeah
You can't be nobody else's, ayy
You can't be nobody else's
I thought I told you before
I thought I let your ass know, ho-ho-ho
Straight from the jump
Ain't gonna tell your ass twice
Gonna tell your ass once, wait
All of them questions you asking
I thought I gave you the answers
Whenever you call me, I answer
I gave you all that you asked for
Now I can't pick up the phone
Now I can try to relax more
I'm puttin' stamps on my passport, yeah, ho

[Bridge]
She don't know what she gon' do, whoa (What she gon' do)
I don't know what I'm gon' say, yeah (What I'm gon' say)
We don't know where we gon' go, whoa (Where we gon' go)
Beach boy sail away, yeah yeah
