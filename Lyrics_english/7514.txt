Hands in the air lyrics [see 1]
You, who lose control, speaking loudly
You are hurting my heart
I, trying to listen, I can't explain myself
What a strange feeling

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You don't want to understand me
And you send me to shut up telling me
I shouldn't surprise myself
Because that's the reality of our love, and I
[Chorus]
I do not have a guns for confront you
I put my hands, hands in the air
I just care to love you in body and soul
As it was yesterday

[See 2]
You, who lost control, you let yourself take
Because insecurity
I have seen you grow, I can imagine
That everything will change

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Today, even if everything remains the same
And you send me to shut up telling me
That you have to master or will be the end
And I can't

[Chorus]
I do not have a guns for confront you
I put my hands, hands in the air
I only care to love you in body and soul
As it was yesterday
I do not have a guns for confront you
I put my hands, hands in the air
I only care to love you in body and soul
As it was yesterday
I do not have a guns for confront you
I put my hands, hands in the air
I only care to love you in body and soul
As it was yesterday
