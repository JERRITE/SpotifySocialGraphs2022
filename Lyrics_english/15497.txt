One foot after another foot (live) Lyricsla Road 
 That leads to the sea 
 Shines with the full moon 

 Fireworks fly in my head 
 Summer has knocked on the door 

 The blood runs 
 Light in my veins 
 And there is in the air 
 New illusions 
 They roll the waves 
 Loaded with sand 
 Under a shower of stars 

 I can feel the breeze 
 Brea scented 
 That touches me and takes away my sorrows 

 Fly the foam 
 Palm trees move 
 And even the moon dances in the bonfires 

 CHORUS 

 One foot after another foot, without running 
 Step by step, the pores of my skin 
 They wake up slowly 
 One foot after another I am 
 Trembling just like a child trembles 
 One foot after another I'm going 
 In case I get with you 

 Living in memory is not worth it 
 More account is suffered 
 But no matter how much I try to throw you 
 Of my head, silly, my heart is not left 
 You Might Also Likehoy a year ago 
 I saw you for the first time 
 With the madness of your brunette skin
