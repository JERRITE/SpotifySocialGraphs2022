Chulin Culin Chunfly Lyrics [letter from "Chulin Culin Chunfly" ft. 13TH Street]

[Intro: Voltio, resident]
With your chulin culin cunfly
I open my mouth and my tongue falls
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
[Verse 1: resident]
I like how your papaya guaya
If you go pa'llá, grape! Guaya
That she goes with guava, Pa'llá goes
To take off the devil'e on top
Malla room
You see the line, the partisure
The one that divides the whiteness of your hard pean
Your ere 'pure blood, pure blood
For you I leave the celibacy and I take away 'e cura
(He swears'?)
Nah, or pa 'so much! Well, after I sing
I'm going to any saint
Four banks assault and I threw me with a ravine

[Verse 2: volt]
I sometimes tranco, but even if I managed
Le Guayo El Calanco in his White Pants
In which the pandorca springs
(Abuser!) After the breeding, hangs her
He has it on a diet but whatever he wants he is fat
He doesn't eat corn, but he loves cob
If it turns on fire you have to hit the hose
We follow the pichaera

[Choir: Resident, Voltio]
With your chulin culin cunfly
I open my mouth and my tongue falls
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai

What aejo, Shorty?
What You Gonna do?
Let the palitroque wet in ragú sauce
Pa 'wet the fingers in Baby Food
Hey, do not kill me that this is not kung-fu
That devil is crazy, it is that stilla
Champion, like the Wonder Woman
Baby acetone with Pasoa and Agua Maravilla
Since I am fu manchu, I pulled him to the button
You have me cold as in yellow fever
If Danny catches her on the wheelbarrow
The bumper shines, I guaya the buckle
I sucks me the voltage and the bulb mel
I climbed the same day like 24 vece '
In 20 nails it doesn't look like
I ask him: "What do you like?"
Fast grows:
I LIKE JULIO VOLTIO AND RESIDENT CALLE 13

[Verse 4: resident]
Tonga la Singa Mama Sanga
Moving the catanga flavor pichanga
With a little 'and grace like the bamba
I leave the hips changas
To sweat Panda bear broth
And even the gringas dance
Out of pace with zambas legs
If you are a chumba then he wiggled your back
You don't have to have buttocks to stop my head bald
What you have to have is a lot of volcanic lava
Organic beautiful
Botanical green
Aceitosa, mechanics
[Chorus]
With your chulin culin cunfly
I open my mouth and my tongue falls
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai
I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope you are my mai

[Outro]
Everything is under control here
Everything under control
(Here) all under control
(Here) all under control
We Got It Under Control
We Got It Under Control
(We) We Got It Under Control
(We-We) under control
(Everything under control)
I 'this is the voltage with the resident
Look, let me enter that I am a resident (open!)
1-3
Advance and open that I am a resident (Calle 13)
Aphogue!
I 'is Julio Voltio, you know
Everything under control
Resident Calle 13
(Resident Calle 13) (Heard?)
Afghagos, the voltage
Out there: White lion
In Puertororo: The White Lion
(What a habit, ma?)
The people who know the most of toysbed
