Lyrics giant steps [Gigante Steps "letter]] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Tell me how you sleep in immensity 
 No one did the joy to teach you 
 You give up 

 Clouds that are black 
 They start wetting 
 Between great waves 
 A ship that leaves 
 You sink 
 Giant steps 
 They come to crush you 
 You are looking for and you can't find 
 You don't know where to be 
 You give up 

 If I gave advice to a woman 
 what would? 
 What loves 
 Already a young woman? 
 What loves 
 Already a girl? 
 What loves 

 [Bridge] 
 It is done 
 I hope it was not too long .. 

 Thank you so much Mrs 
 Thanks to you, Miss 

 [Outro] 
 Goodbye
