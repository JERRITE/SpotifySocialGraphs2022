Untitled God Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
And maybe my god
Has a trot in her walk
And her coach bags are knock-off
Her shoes are all dressed up
And she spins me around like a marionette
Oh my web is still spinning
My web is still spinning
My web is still spinning
You can't see it yet
[Verse 2]
Or maybe my god
Has thick hips and big lips
And the buttons she's pressing
She speaks every language
Shift A, right B, Nintendo 63
On her video, baby
The game she's been changing

[Verse 3]
When you're drunk near a sunset
Look straight in her eyes
She's a quick glimpse of heaven
Forgetting her headlights are on
When you misread her fortune
Don't misread the joke
She's the note on your lampshade
The honeycomb holding you

[Outro]
And she spins me around like a marionette
Oh my web is still spinning
My web is still spinning
My web is still spinning
You can't see it yetYou might also like3Embed
