You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Lyrics[Verse 1: Sofia Wylie & Frankie Rodriguez]
Some days you've gotta take some time to breathe
Let your heart off the leash
'Cause it ain't meant to shine in one place
Remind yourself at times that time can wait
Just 'cause you take a break
Don't mean the lights are out on Broadway

[Verse 2: Matt Cornett & Julia Lester]
We build monuments in our sleep
Climb mountains too high to reach
There's so much more than they see on the daily
Strength in numbers, second to none
Come up like we're numbеr one
Recharged and rеady to run, run, run
[Chorus: Cast of HSMTMTS]
Roarin' louder than thunder
But you'll never see it comin', see it comin'
As long as we've got each other
Watch out, 'cause you ain't seen nothin', ain't seen nothin'

[Verse 3: Dara Reneé & Larry Saperstein]
No stress, ain't overdressed, we keep our cool
Playin' by our own rules, no divide, that's how we conquer
Time out don't mean we're 'bout to step aside
Just maintenance for the ride
That's gettin' better, faster, stronger

[Verse 4: Joe Serafini & Olivia Rodrigo]
Ain't no rainin' on this parade
'Cause we're a force that's self-made
Do what we do, and we do it our way

[Chorus: Cast of HSMTMTS]
Roarin' louder than thunder
But you'll never see it comin', see it comin'
As long as we've got each other
Watch out, 'cause you ain't seen nothin', ain't seen nothin'

[Post-Chorus: Cast of HSMTMTS]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You ain't seen nothin', ain't seen nothin'

When they go low (They go low), we go high (We go high), we go high
When they go low, we go high
When they go low, we go high
When they go low (They go low), we go high, we go high
We go high, we go high, we go high

[Chorus: Cast of HSMTMTS]
Roarin' louder than thunder
But you'll never see it comin', but you'll never see it comin'
As long as we've got each other
Watch out, 'cause you ain't seen nothin', you ain't seen nothin'

[Post-Chorus: Cast of HSMTMTS  & Dara Reneé]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You ain't seen nothin' (No), ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You ain't seen nothin', ain't seen nothin' yet1Embed
