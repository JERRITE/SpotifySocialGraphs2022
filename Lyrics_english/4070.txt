BETWEEN LYRICS CREAM [LETTER OF "BETWEEN PRIMOS"]

[Verse 1: Granuja]
I am selfless because nothing interests me
We already have the cream and at the tip the cherry
Everything changed and it is normal to listen to these oddities
I don't even care what saint do you p.
I have malice although I am not from the militia
More drugged than Alicia's story
Do not notice that you are no longer news
Here are more herbs than in Leticia
Do not stole me that I am looking for what benefits me the most
Without special effects
Floating in space missions
They think they know of the beginnings without knowing the initials
We are not underground or commercial
I don't have iron
The one who bullets a bullet dies, I don't trust iron
Yes I can! I always walk with my dogs
You have to go out for being so zalamero
[Verse 2: Mañas Ru-Fino]
I don't throw gunpowder in me, I am Gallinazo
In El Gallinaceo another scarce candy
I go for my dust for a fuck
With glass look and on her, barefoot
I ate the apple, my body full of benzene
In your breasts my gaze
I go further but I don't say it and nothing happens
They did me without brakes
It's me, another way to sin
They disappear when I smoke, they made me papear
I don't even look like stopping
Write or don't write anyone can erase me
Over time I quote me, the godson of Tizón
I hit like tyson
My flow never taso, my arm is gone
I always happen, I make them see how clowns

[Verse 3: crude means raw]
The Son of those who are
Those of the seasoning, those who are at the foot of the canyon
YES, Yes I ’come be the flavor
Never monotonous in the microphone
The Cacique de Manrique to Mozambique
Hum
Close the snout, which we compete with poise
And since they don't know how to rhyme, then offer lead?
HELL No! It lacks balls
Your rap is dry and regular Pangola
I put rhythms like Angola bongoceros
With rude flows that come out with Pola breath
HOLD UP, AND ROLL UP AND SMOKE IT
If she puts the body I put the bud that blows
Oh Yes! Illuminated I do pela
But I need a fire, who has the candle?

Flow suitcase like Jim Carroll without a car
Who chooses mine will make him see bad
A Frescobar planning a stick
Those of the solar filling another room
Do you want rap? I have more, I am my own illness
I do not talk
I do not speak I want to bend, I record to remember
Killer to track, Bang!
If I write unemployment to time
Under the noise I have fun
I perceive the incorrect from its affection
They want to give me reasons and I want to give concerts
Distributed as Croupier, my crew is still standing
They carry my phrases in the skin
I have a thousand bases on the temple
We are the Gra $ A and thus you tried honey, Bitch! Embed
