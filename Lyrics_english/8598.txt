Heaven for Everyone (Roger Taylor Vocal) Lyrics(This could be heaven)
(This could be heaven)
(This could be heaven)
This could be heaven, this could be heaven for everyone
(This could be heaven)
This could be heaven, this could be heaven, this could be heaven for everyone
In these days of cool reflection (reflection)
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone (yeah)
This world should be free, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love,love,love,love
This could be heaven for everyone

You know that
(this could be heaven for everyone)
Yes!
(this could be heaven for everyone)

This could be heaven for everyone

Listen
What people do to other souls
They take their lives,destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone
You might also likeThis could be heaven, this could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven (this could be heaven)
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven (this could be heaven)
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven....
For everyone
For everyoneEmbed
