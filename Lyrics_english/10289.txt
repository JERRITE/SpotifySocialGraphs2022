Heartworks Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of guy who doesn't think before he speaks
Words come flowing before I can stop the leaks
You're the kind of girl who likes to roll her eyes at me
I find it hard to believe that
We could make a good team

[Pre-Chorus]
I get this feeling
Morning to evening
And it won't leave me, no
[Chorus]
I like the way your heart works
Not cold like the others
I like the way my ear turns
When we're close to each other
Every night, you and I
Just lay awake, killing time
'Cause I like the way your heart works
I like the way your heart works

'Cause I like the way your heart works
I like the way your heart works

[Verse 2]
It's the kind of thing that I don't know what I should say
So used to wondering whether my feelings might change
I think I lost the voice that screamed "run away"
Feels like yesterday and nothing was the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I get this feeling
Morning to evening
And it won't leave me, no

[Chorus]
I like the way your heart works
Not cold like the others
I like the way my ear turns
When we're close to each other
Every night, you and I
Just lay awake, killing time
'Cause I like the way your heart works
I like the way your heart works
You might also like'Cause I like the way your heart works
I like the way your heart works

'Cause I like the way your heart works
I like the way your heart worksEmbed
