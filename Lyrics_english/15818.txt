Lyrics fresh water drops ["Fresh water droplet"]

[Intro]
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui

[Verse 1]
A long time ago I fell in love with such beautiful eyes
Common of the ocean shine
It was what least in my plan I was
Although I admit that sometimes I dreamed
With the beauty of your gaze
[Pre-car]
I want to take the pace of your heart
To dance between the two this song
The truth, I'm in love again
The truth, I want you to know that

[Chorus]
What I feel for you, is love
Want that makes me useful, the heart
Drug that makes me immune, in the face of pain
Fresh water drops, sun ray
What I feel for you, is love
Want that makes me useful, the heart
Drug that makes me immune, in the face of pain
Fresh water drops, sun ray

[Interlude]
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui
Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui

[Verse 2]
Take me, to be precise, for the sembranza of your shadow
I know that you turn on the light and in my life you look out
Like the white pigeons, when the square is taken
With immortal flight
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
I want to take the pace of your heart
To dance between the two this song
The truth, I'm in love again
The truth, I want you to know that

[Chorus]
What I feel for you, is love
Want that makes me useful, the heart
Drug that makes me immune, in the face of pain
Fresh water drops, sun ray
What I feel for you, is love
Want that makes me useful, the heart
Drug that makes me immune, in the face of pain
Fresh water drops, sun ray

[Outro]
It is what I feel for you
It is what I feel for you
This is what I feel for trembed
