I lost lyrics [letter: "I lost you from sh√©]

[Verse 1]
I have a shame that wants to leave
And a great remorse that tells me about you
You don't see what I am but what I was
You stay with what I hide and not what I said
I look at you and swear, I don't know what to say
The damage we did will not heal
Yes, you think I have doubts the answer is yes
Yes questions until, I say until the end
We cry until the sun rises again
I do not fit in this puzzle that you call love
I'm not what you expected now you see it
But you didn't understand me either
[Pre-car]
That not everything is as nice how they painted it yesterday
They don't tell you when you start, that in the end everything ends
That life turns a thousand and steals what you loved
And you never return that piece that lacked you

[Chorus]
I lost you, for not understanding what you needed
For lying a thousand times to the face
For not taking care of what mattered most, I didn't value you
Then I lost you

[Post-car]
I with my screams turned off your voice
And it's something that I won't forgive myself
If I don't want you to download God now
If I listen to your goodbye I will die, huhh

[Verse 2]
I have a thousand defects that I never accepted
I never learned to want that is the great truth
What damage pride did, both mine and yours
The one that sometimes blinds us and does not let us walk
Everything I've learned, maybe I forgot it
Because I'm still stumbling on the same step
If I ever offend you, I never thought about it
And I know that it is not enough to apologize

They don't tell you when you start, that in the end everything ends
That life turns a thousand and steals what you loved

[Chorus]
I lost you, for not understanding what you needed
For lying a thousand times to the face
For not taking care of what mattered most, I didn't value you
Then I lost you

[Post-car]
I with my screams turned off your voice
And it's something that I won't forgive myself
If I don't want you to download God now
If I listen to your goodbye I will die

[Chorus]
I lost you, for not understanding what you needed
For lying a thousand times to the face
For not taking care of what mattered most, I didn't value you
Then I lost you ... 1embed
