Drive Away Lyrics[Verse 1: Jacob Bryant]
It seems that I'm in trouble
I've been seeing double
I went out, couldn't be alone
Now I'm thinking I don't wanna go home

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Bryant]
Then you call (Then you call)
I pick up (I pick up)
And your voice pulls me back in again
Will you come (Will you come)
Pick me up? (Pick me up)
Baby, I'm in some kind of way
[Chorus: Jacob Bryant]
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away from here
So far away from here
We'll let the world disappear
As we drive away from here

[Verse 2: Jacob Bryant & Kacey Musgraves]
It looks like it's about to start raining
I'll be out here waiting
Smoking cigarettes to pass the time
While people stand and watch me in a long line, line

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Bryant & Kacey Musgraves, together]
Then you call (Then I call)
I pick up (You pick up)
And your voice pulls me back in again
Will you come (Yeah, I'll come)
Pick me up? (Pick you up)
Baby, I'm in some kind of way

[Chorus: Jacob Bryant & Kacey Musgraves]
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away from here
So far away from here
We'll let the world disappear
As we drive away from here

Pick me up? (Pick you up)
Baby, I'm in some kind of way

[Chorus: Jacob Bryant & Kacey Musgraves]
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away
I don't care where we go
Just come pick me up and we'll drive away from here
So far away from here
We'll let the world disappear
As we drive away from hereEmbed
