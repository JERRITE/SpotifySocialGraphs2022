Bowl For Two LyricsI, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you

Yes you know it is time
For us to sit down and unwind
I know the feeling, I know the feeling
So stay with me tonight
Gonna kick back relax
Make sure the ganja's packed
And we'll feel all right
We're flying high now
We're flying high now
I cannot feel the ground
We're flying high now
We're flying high now
My world is spinning round
I said, I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
So please don't run, run away
When my ganja's all gone
A promise that, that you're gon gonna stay
When my flight is all done
There's only one thing left to do
I got this one nug this frosty purple nug
And it's big enough for a two
I said I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you

We're flying high now
We're flying high now
I cannot feel the ground
We're flying high now
We're flying high now
My world is spinning round
I said I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
When I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I
I'm gonna wanna smoke it with youYou might also like6Embed
