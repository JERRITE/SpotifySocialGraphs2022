Wicked Mystic LyricsAll throughout the centuries, existing year to year
Lives on the powerful entity to thrive on pain and fear
A derelict of heavenly Gods, a feeling from within
Weakened minds are perfect prey, corrosion will begin

[Chorus:]
Some won't fight, the battle is forsaken
Show no might, the dark side has awakened

Even in the holiest the curious can be found
Their wonderment is dangerous as virtue is but bound
Moral codes broken
What's the sin that lurks within, the burning emotion of hatred
[Chorus:]
Some won't fight, the battle is forsaken
Show no might, the dark side has awakened

Wicked Mystic

Hatred lurks in all of us, no one is exempt
It's proof of evil in our souls, is this the tempter's intent
A derelict of heavenly Gods, a feeling from within
Weak minds are perfect prey for corrosion to begin

[Chorus:]
Some won't fight, the battle is forsaken
Show no might, the dark side has awakened

Wicked Mystic
