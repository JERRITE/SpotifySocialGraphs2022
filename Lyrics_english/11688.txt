Seventeen Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ayy
Never worry 'bout a single hatin' motherfucker
Lookin' like my next supper
All these moves that I'm makin' got people talkin'
Like, "How many papers is this man signin'?"
I'm back wit' the backpack rap
Man, I'm thinkin' that this shit finna make them scat
Got a bag full of cash if we talkin' 'bout that
Run, run it like Forrest Gump, can you feel that? Ayy
I'm a renaissance man
If you wanna get a feat', you not gon' get response, man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous, don't be rude, go back to rollin' up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin' on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin' up camp
When the females hear my name, I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian, I make that kitty go ham (Damn)
[Chorus]
Ballin', only seventeen, my skin is green
Watchin' numbers goin' up, that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up, they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube, I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Chorus]
Always sayin' no when you ask 'em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say, "No bitch, this dick ain't free"
Watchin' on your every move, I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

[Verse 2]
You got cash, buy some chains
I buy houses, ain't that strange?
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("Who the fuck is Zac?" "High School Musical")
Bitch hold my stacks, I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance
Better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me through this day, sippin' on Bombay
I don't trust you gotta take this survey
Man, I don't look back, never cut no slack
Better get way back, 'fore yo ass get smacked, uh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho
Never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin' on your Instagram, I see that shit is going slow
Always hating on the progress, man, yo' ass has gotta go

Ballin', only seventeen, my skin is green
Watchin' numbers goin' up, that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up, they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube, I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Chorus]
Always sayin' no when you ask 'em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say, "No bitch, this dick ain't free"
Watchin' on your every move, I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie13Embed
