Miracles Out of Nowhere Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a crystal morning, I can see the dewdrops falling
Down from gleaming heaven. I can hear the voices call
When you coming home now, son? the world is not for you
Tell me, what's your point of view?

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Mister Madman, what you know that I don't know?
Tell me some crazy stories; let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing; he turns and walks away
Tell me, what made you that way?
[Chorus]
Here I am, just waiting for a sign
Asking questions; learning all the time
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere

[Verse 3]
Tell me now, dear Mother, what's it like to be so old?
Children grown and leaving; seems the world is growing cold
And though your body's ailing you, your mind is just like new
Tell me where you're going to

[Chorus]
It's so simple, I mean right before your eyes
If you'll only look through this disguise
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
Love and miracles out of nowhere

[Musical interlude]

[Verse 4]
I sang this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the Western heroes do
Tell me what you're gonna do
You might also like[Chorus]
Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life, I knew that it was mine
It's always here; it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere;
Love and miracles out of nowhere
(Out of nowhere)1Embed
