Taciturn Lyrics[Verse 1]
Across the sea to you
I've left myself deserted here again
Across the sea to you
My pieces are too broken now to mend

[Pre-Chorus]
In the middle, under a cold, black sky
The sun will only burn for you and I
In the moment, before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time
[Chorus]
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

[Verse 2]
Across the world for you
My reasons have no reason to remain
I'd cross the world for you
I don't know what I'm doing wrong
But I can't stay the same

[Pre-Chorus]
In the middle, under a clear blue sky
The sun can only burn for you and I
In the moment, before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time

[Chorus]
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

[Chorus]
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything
Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything (Everything)
Everything
