A Little Too Not Over You Lyrics[Intro]
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
(Aye-aye-aye)
Ooh-oh
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
(Aye-aye-aye)

[Verse 1]
You never cross my mind at all
It's what I tell myself
What we had has come and gone
You're better off with someone else
It's for the best, I know it is
But I see you
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I try to hide
What I feel inside
And I turn around
You're with him now
I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you

[Post-Chorus]
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
(Aye-aye-aye)
Not over you
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
Ooh-ooh
(Aye-aye-aye)

[Verse 2]
The memories are supposed to fade
What's wrong with my heart?
Shake it off, let it go
Didn't think it'd be this hard
Should be strong, movin' on
But I see you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I try to hide
What I feel inside
And I turn around
You're with him now
I just can't figure it out

[Chorus]
Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you

[Bridge]
Maybe I regret everything I said
No way to take it all back, yeah
Now I'm on my own
How I let you go
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Yeah, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoa, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
I'm just a little too not over you
Tell me why you're so hard to forget
Don't remind me, I'm not over it
Tell me why
I can't seem to face the truth
And I really don't know what to do
I'm just a little too not over you

[Outro]
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
(Aye-aye-aye)
Not over you
(Aye-aye-aye, oh)
Ooh
(Aye-aye-aye)1Embed
