[Verse 1]
When you lose all the games
When he sleeps with loneliness
When the exits are closed
And the night will not leave me alone

[Verse 2]
When you feel fear of silence
WHEN TO KEEP ME HE PLAYING
When memories rebel
And put me against the wall
[Chorus]
I will resist upright
I will become iron to harden the skin
And although the winds of life blow strong
I am like the reed that bends
But always standing

I will resist to continue living
I will endure the blows and I will never give up
And although dreams break my pieces
I will resist, I will resist

[Verse 3]
When the world loses all magic
When my enemy is me
When the nostalgia stabs me
And do not recognize my voice

[Verse 4]
When the madness threatens me
When cross comes out in my currency
When the devil passes the invoice
Or if you ever miss me

[Chorus]
I will resist upright
I will become iron to harden the skin
And although the winds of life blow strong
I am like the reed that bends
But always standing
You might also like to continue living
I will endure the blows and I will never give up
And although dreams break my pieces
I will resist, I will resist

[Bridge]
This is country, ladies and gentlemen
Just as the song says, you sing and don't cry
Let's take care of the Garden for Flowers
After the storm I know there will be better times

When you lose all the games
When he sleeps with loneliness
When the exits are closed
And the night will not leave me alone

[Chorus]
I will resist erect in front of everything (in front of everything)
I will become iron to harden the skin
And although the winds of life blow strong
I am like the reed that bends
But always standing

I will resist to continue living
I will endure the blows and I will never give up
And although dreams break my pieces
I will resist, I will resistembed
