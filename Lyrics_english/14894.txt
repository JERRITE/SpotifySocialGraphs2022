TranslationsFran√ßaisSeasons Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
It's been a lil' cold
At night outside
Switch out the wardrobe
Gotta be dressed for the ride
Got hit with a winter breeze
And oh, we like to act tough, what we do it for?
Be careful with energy
No need to be so cold, I wanna be more

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a real long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling
[Verse 2: Khalid]
I've been goin' through, you been through it (You been through it)
I fall back to look at what we're doing (Now)
I can yell at you, but what's the use? (What's the use?)
If you really love me, gotta prove it
I'm carrying this baggage, need to pack light
Hate seein' you sad, I gotta act right
I'm looking forward for the brighter
Oh, my love

[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a really long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Have you ever looked at someone and said, "I could spend my whole life witcha"?
You're lucky the greatest thing I can do is marry you
'Cause if I could, I'd spill my blood
Down to give you my last breath
The old me is on his last stretch
I guess a new season's next (Next)

[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]
Ooh, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooh, summer's calling
(I done had a really long winter)
A beautiful summer's calling

Miscommunication leads to complication and...
Here we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed
'Cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that
You were never taught how to say loving things and caring things
You were just taught how to say what had to be said
So, I want the words that you don't have and I'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel
Just think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the way10Embed
