TranslationEnglishella Lyrics ["she" letter]]

[Verse 1]
And a bag to give the lift
And a little girl that burns with cold
Three, four barbies, very precious to dance
THE SOLECITO IN THE AWAY I SEE TO PASS
My company passes me a tobacco pa 'enbaisar
I feel my heart, I start throbbing
I had been experiencing for some time
I don't know what that is, I think butterflies say
[Verse 2]
I've been looking at her for a while and I don't stop looking at her
Beautiful lips, his spectacular face
I approach and I don't know if greeting
But it's not bad, I'm going to get back
What a beautiful girl, believe me it was the truth
I touched his shoulder and instantly looks at me
His hand hits and takes me with dancing
I was crazy about his look
And as she gets hit and puts me to dance
His body stuck to mine made me vibrate
I am afraid and I don't want to fall in love
But it's late and believe me that I like it

[Verse 3]
Two, three songs and not stop
I am not interested, while I am next to her
Three, four drinks and the party improves
We met while the song sounds
I don't even tell you, they already know what happened
Rolled in my bed and just when the sun came out
We slept together, I was very crazy
And here the story of this story ends

Here I continue, in the club smoking a rooster
Always observing in case
The days pass and I have not looked again
I pray to God to do it and to arrive
I close my eyes and I remember your face
How he danced, smiled and that look
Luna, tell you who can already look at her
Tell him to come back and here I'm going to wait for her2embed
