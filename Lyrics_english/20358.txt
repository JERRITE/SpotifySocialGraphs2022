Zeeshan

[Verse 1: KSI]
Now she wanna call me asking favours
Still, I'm on the hunt for different flavours
While my mind is here deciding right or wrong
Did I mess up all along
As I scroll up, looking through my older pictures
Bitches buzzing up the phone for me or just my riches
Now I get suspicious
All from being so ambitious
Now I see the circle vicious
Searching for satisfaction
Only getting a fraction of that feeling
And it’s fucking up my intuition
Now they wanna steal
[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
'Cause a nigga only loyal as their last meal
Got a half a milli stacking on my last deal
And they wonder why I'm paranoid
’Cause they jump, man, just to get that Jumpman (Yeah)

[Chorus: KSI & Randolph]
Damn, I'm on red alert (Red alert)
Else you'll end up in the dirt, man
I don't wanna hurt man
Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Wanna)
Champagne popping
How I wanna let it rain (Rain)
And they know that (Agh, agh)
I'm on red alert (Red alert)
Else you end up in the dirt, man
I don't wanna hurt man
Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Nah)
Champagne popping
Still, I’m watching all you Judas motherfuckers

[Post-Chorus: Randolph]
I got eyes on my surroundings
Enemies worth money
But family’s worth diamonds
Friends come and go
When it rains, when it snows
But the loyal ones stay
Through the pain, through the cold

Uh, humble beginnings and now I'm making strides
Ain’t nuttin' changed, but the rhythm and the rhymes
Threw the dice, yeah
Now I'm living life, yeah
I'm on the road and I got all of the lights, yeah
But still, I ain’t got it all
I'm still searching, yeah
Shrunk the circle but they still lurking
Fuck it, tonight we raising the glass high
Everybody eating 'cause that's how we live the best life
But I see the fakes from the real
I see the jealousy build, yeah
I see the way that you feel
I see them eyeing my deal, yeah (Yeah)
They must think that I'm blind
Get yours, I get mine
'Cause I ain't playing with that time
That's why I'm (Ay)

[Chorus: KSI & Randolph]
Damn, I'm on red alert (Red alert)
Else you'll end up in the dirt, man (Uh)
I don't wanna hurt man (Nah)
Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Wanna)
Champagne popping
How I wanna let it rain (Rain)
And they know that (Agh, agh)
I'm on red alert (Red alert)
Else you end up in the dirt, man
I don't wanna hurt man
Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Nah)
Champagne popping
Still, I'm watching all you Judas motherfuckers
[Post-Chorus: Randolph]
I got eyes on my surroundings
Enemies worth money
But family's worth diamonds
Friends come and go
When it rains, when it snows
But the loyal ones stay
Through the pain, through the cold15Embed
