Takikardia Lyrics ["Takikardia" letter]]

Oh no no no no no no
Uoh no no no, no
Kenny Kenny Kenny Man
Kenny Man, the creature

Elian Davis
You know
Last night I saw her
Nacho
Every time I see that brunette, my mind machine, my mind machine
Bad things
Good things, my mind machine, my mind machine

And it is that you ‘ta good to take the bed at once (at once)
And not to sleep (aha)
‘Ta very good to take the bed at once (at once)
And not to sleep

WHY, WHY
And not to sleep
WHY, WHY
And not to sleep

But to give you give you my love
I have no yacht or a mansion
All I have is this humble heart
That beats me beats when you dance reggaeton

Or full, of the good
Of the old or new school
Has PA ’Finca
And 10 pounds of hip
You do not teach him a step that she dances in her way
I reveal me all night with her
You Might Also Likeporque, me beats me, I beat my heart
I have tachycardia
Oh yes sir

I beat me, my heart beats
I have tachycardia
Oh yes sir

Oh no
There is no pulse, there is no pulse
When I see that chocolate
There is no pulse, there is no pulse
When I see that chocolate

Last night I went out with that woman (ey)
And he took me out of the planet
Last night I went out with that woman
And it took me to the stars (Yeh)

‘Ta very good to take the bed at once (at once)
And not to sleep
‘Ta very good to take the bed at once (at once)
And not to sleep

WHY, WHY
And not to sleep
WHY, WHY
And not to sleep
I don't know if it's from Panama, from Venezuela or Puerto Rico
But move your ass rich
With me for the album, oh, I invite her
It always sticks to me in Meneíto position

And I love your style, I love your body
Let's stay awake baby let's not waste time
Is that I paralyze every time I contemplate you
When you touch me, it causes me and I time

That leaves me fried
That hyponcito
If I am neglected, I eat it a whole
Ohhh, I only refer to the tests
Parce, Divina Pa ’Eat the little gift ay blessed

I know you like my raggamuffin flow
You look so sexy baby with that outfit (aha)
I have many babys
But you are the ophi
Since in the morning warm you bring me coffee

Because, I'm beat me, my heart beats
I have tachycardia
Oh yes sir

I beat me, my heart beats
I have tachycardia
Oh yes sir

Oh no
There is no pulse, there is no pulse
When I see that chocolate
There is no pulse, there is no pulse
When I see that chocolate
