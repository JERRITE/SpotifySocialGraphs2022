I'm not going to die Lyrics [lyrics by "I'm not going to die"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Again 
 Talking alone against the wall 
 Here everything is normal 
 I see people go through my window 

 [Chorus] 
 No, I'm not going to die 
 Nothing will change just because you are not here 
 No, it doesn't hurt, no 
 It's just that sometimes my heart betrays me 
 [Verse 2] 
 Again 
 Talking to the mirror about him 
 Here nothing could change 
 I see the moon shine through my window 

 [Chorus] 
 No, I'm not going to die 
 Nothing will change just because you are not here 
 No, it doesn't hurt, no 
 It's just that sometimes my heart betrays me 

 [Bridge] 
 Old letters, broken dreams, stars and your eyes 
 Everything we didn't say 
 And what we promised 
 The songs we listen to and the forgotten books 
 All that is a memory because you are far away 

 [Chorus] 
 No, I'm not going to die 
 Nothing will change just because you are not here 
 No, it doesn't hurt, no 
 It's just that sometimes my heart is betrayed might also like1embed
