Body for sale Lyrics [letter of "body for sale" ft. Myke Towers, Rauw Alejandro & Almighty]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro]
Ah-Ah-Ah
Ah-Ah-Ah
Ah-ah-ah (Me!)

[Saying: Rauw Alejandro]
She already got tired of being the victim
Now his heart no longer hurt him
Tears were over (ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Almighty]
There is no longer to lie to him
He put his body for sale
Says love does not exist
That one and who invents it
There is no longer to lie to him
He put her body for sale (hey, she put on money)
Says love does not exist
That one is who invents it (hahaha, and you put pa 'she)

[Verse 1: almighty]
She put her body at an auction, became a gymnast
Now it is only put to spend (cash)
Do not eat carbohydrates, but you talk about pasta (hahaha)
That she wants a Mercedes, does not want a mazda (rrr!)
Here the horn 'stick as in the' letter 'to the stamp'
The life law has no trap '(never)
They throw a ticket 'that are like the rain, that does not escape
I put it until it is invalidated to use ramp (mommy!)
You my whore, I your fucking
He makes his money because that is his life, I do not argue (there is no zero ')
The heart is black because it is mourning
And if your wife is a stripper, not the Celes, don't be gross

[Verse 2: Noriel]
(Ah; No-No-Noriel)
I no longer mix the feeling 'with the mind (aha)
He made his heart, the tit 'and the tooth' (Wuh!)
Before they lied, now she is the one who lies (normal)
When he is going out, a Phillie pa 'enters into the environment
They don't see the face again (ah)
The next one tries (ah), she swears that 'she will pay for face' (Wuh!)
No one could have to date, even Cupid died (prr)
Because she buried the arrow (hahaha)
And now he lives his life to the limit (ah)
There will be no man who limits it (ah)
Of to'as her friend 'now she is the elite (aha)
Because there is no one to imite it (wuh!, No-no-noriel)

Ra-Rauw
He left the hearts' for pleasure
No longer looking
Let me enter, forget yesterday
Even if I think 'I'm the same as them (Yah!)
Before he spent lying
Now he goes avenging
Prefer to be alone mistreating
How bad to accompany another sticking them (Yah!)
I did not believe in twin souls (no)
You don't care if you look out '
It is nobody, does what he wants, Yeah-Yeah

[Verse 4: Myke Towers]
Already she, she did not and 'the victim, now is the victim (-Mar√≠a)
It has a bad guille (bad), as you have seen, it varies '(varies')
He likes to position 'imaginary' (imaginary ')
But he says that being in four is primary (primary)
And it is not prostituted, but it is released if they pay
And if you turn on, don't go out, the bottles don't end, baby
And the women 'as you know they are face'
But the beautiful is the one that never separates us
He no longer wants a lie '
That's why he throws me and ours does not expire
And when you write to me '
I will be arranged to do to 'what you say'
He likes to have me up

Says love does not exist
That one e 'who invents it, Yeh (Yeh)
