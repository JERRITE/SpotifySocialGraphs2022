Wherever You Are Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
For a while we pretended
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye
You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
Torn in two and I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of
[Chorus: All, Luke]
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are

[Verse 2: Calum, Calum & Ashton]
I could fly a thousand oceans
But there's nothing that compares to what we had
And so I'll walk alone
I wish I didn't have to be gone
Maybe you've already moved on
But the truth is I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
Torn in two and I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of

[Chorus: All, Luke]
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are
You might also like[Bridge: Luke]
You can say we'll be together some day
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same
So why can't I stop feeling this way?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Torn in two and I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of

[Chorus: All, Luke]
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are31Embed
