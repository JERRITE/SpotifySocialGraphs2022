Boom boom (remix) Lyrics [intro: jory, j Alvarez & Valentino]
Yeah!
Magnate and Valentino Oh!
J Alvarez, Magnate and Valentino
Nova and Jory
So you tell me what happened
The Official Remix

I saw you looking baby
The album is dark but it looks, it looks
Nobody is pending and you know
Come and look for what you want
And if she asks sex, I give it to him
And if I ask me for a kiss, I give it to him
There is no fear that kills the desire
All Ðµso heals with alcohol
[Chorus: Valentino]
That girl wants boom boom
What dominates her with that Monton
To the rhythm that reggaeton-ton sounds
He loves action, addicted to Dembow
Juquia with my flow

That girl wants boom boom
That dominates her with that Monton
To the rhythm that reggaeton-ton sounds
He loves action, addicted to Dembow
Juquia with my flow

[Verse 1: j alvarez]
My cat wants boom boom and when I take it I give him a zoom
I imagine you without clothes and a little light
I know you like the pressure and the way I apply it to you
Ask for your song that I give it to you
Bellakeo addict, allergic to get Gistro
If you drink, smoke chicha, and that's what I need
A bottle of Hennessy pa 'take you to ecstasy
Put on position Baby pa 'give you there (short!)
Ey calladita that I am the system
You know that I get to you where he does not reach you
Brega with that and put pa 'mi
Meanwhile I am going to keep behind you
[Chorus: j alvarez]
My shorty asks Boom Boom
And that I master it with that flow oh
That hit the horn and without fear
To carry it, to punish her and not let him pass

My shorty asks Boom Boom
That dominates her with that flow oh oh
To the sound my reggaeton oh
Baby give me a little oh

[Verse 2: nova and jory]
And without thinking you move with the boom boom
What does the dembow do and I get stuck without any problem
And there is no one to kill the desire
Fear goes with a little alcohol

And without thinking you move with the boom boom
What does the dembow do and I get stuck without any problem
And there is no one to kill the desire
Fear goes with a little alcohol

That girl wants boom, to punish her while dancing
It manifests and is addicted to what I bring
Surely I take it, the reverse and not fall
Then the pillo, I get hot without getting out
Oh, do you get out of control and I do whatever lady want
She doesn't go alone, active 'with her rola trip
That punish her and puts her, that the diet does not resist
I already notice you, come and suck your palette
[Bridge: Magnate and Valentino]
A single thing I proposed
That will be released when the lights turn off
And if she wants me to abuse me
With seeing in four how that booty looks

A single thing I proposed
That will be released when the lights turn off
And if she wants her to abuse me
With seeing how that booty in four looks

[Verse 3: Magnate]
That boom boom of that Shorty and his sensual body arrived
That steals looks when it arrives at the party
It has a couple of friends who look like showy
That perreate when nova and jory sounds
And although I know that she is addicted to Dembow
Walk with picket to steal the show
As J loves that flow
I already connect it, to the ear I sing

[Pre-stribe: j alvarez]
Your OH movement
He is killing me and is burning me slowly
Yeah eh
Oh oh is seducing me
It is the baby way of how you play with your hair
J Alvarez The Owner of the System

[Did: Valentino, Magnate & J Alvarez]
That girl wants boom boom (The Official Remix)
That dominates her with that Monton (Aneudy!)
To the rhythm that reggaeton-ton sounds (Top Level Music)
He loves action, addicted to Dembow (Ghost)
Juquia with my flow (The Hunter Mansion)

That girl wants boom boom (eat on!)
That dominates her with that Monton (Santana! The Golden Boy)
To the rhythm that reggaeton-ton sounds (Mario VI)
He loves action, addicted to Dembow (you know how we do)
Juquia with my flow
