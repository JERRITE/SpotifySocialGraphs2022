Lady Red Light LyricsDeep in the night alone in the dark
I get a need for you
In a hotel room I remember the way
How we do what we do

Too long without your touch
Too long without your love
My lady of lights
I'm coming over for you

I call you lover
I call you friend
But when I need another
She's got a heart, a heart to lend
Lady red light, rock me tonight
Baby's got a way to make it all right
Lady red light, rock me tonight
She knows how to move me, lady red light
Lady red light

A shadow of night weighted in time
Really no need to be
Cold and alone, I've made up my mind
Who I need to see

I call you lover
I call you friend
But when I need another
She's got a heart, a heart to lend

Lady red light, rock me tonight
Baby's got a way to make it all right
Lady red light, rock me tonight
She knows how to move me

Lady red light, rock me tonight
Baby's got a way and I feel all right
Lady red light, rock me tonight
She knows how to move me, lady red light

Baby's got a way to make it all right
Lady red light, rock me tonight
She knows how to move me

Lady red light, rock me tonight
Baby's got a way to make it all right
Lady red light, rock me tonight
She really knows how to move me

Lady red light
Lady red light
She knows how to move me
She knows how to move meEmbed
