Guilt Tripping Lyrics[Chorus 1]
So many stars in the sky and I don't know why
They always have to fall on me
Maybe I'm blind to all of the signs
That the world never wanted me

[Chorus 2]
I went outside today
Hoping the sun would burn my face
I went outside today
Hoping I'd feel something
[Verse 1]
My body's weak
It gave up on me
This time I don't think I will get out from
What I'm underneath
It's hard to believe
Another day of rain has come and gone

[Chorus 3]
"Don't go," she said
I wouldn't mind but I'm cold inside
I've felt this bad for so long
I'm scared I'm fine

[Chorus 2]
I went outside today
Hoping the sun would burn my face
I went outside today
Hoping I'd feel something

[Verse 2]
Save room for me in memories
I'd love to always be a small part of
What makes you smile
From time to time
Just think of me and be glad I'm home
You might also like[Verse 3]
Let's close our eyes
We've got time to make each other cry
It's best this way
I'm used to being left behind

[Bridge]
I remember a time when I felt so unlike me
I remember a time when someone could love me
I remember when I still felt alive

[Chorus 3]
"Don't go," she said
I wouldn't mind but I'm cold inside
I've felt so bad for so long
I'm scared I'm fine

[Chorus 1]
So many stars in the sky and I don't know why
They always have to fall on me
Maybe I'm blind to all of the signs
That the world never wanted me

[Chorus 2]
I went outside today
Hoping the sun would burn my face
I went outside today
Hoping I'd feel something8Embed
