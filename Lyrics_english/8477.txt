I don't forget Lyrics ["I don't forget" letter]]

[Verse 1: Cali & el Dandee]
Hi how are you?
If I call you what the answer would be?
My heart of mourning and you are partying
Tell what I do if you don't answer me
If you don't answer me
Oh, how am I going to do with so many kisses that I can't give you?
With so much love that I can't hide?
With a life where I can't talk to you?
[Bridge: The Dandee]
I will not release you
I will not leave you

[Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Cali]
I do not forget you
Even if you are different
Although time has passed and you have missed among the people
I don't forget and give everything to see you
Although you are not by my side
I don't get you out of my mind
Come back with me
That I do not forget

[Verse 2: the dandee / with cali]
I don't forget that time as beautiful as we promised forever
That we would never separate that we would love each other
We would kiss at night
No one is going to dance like you that night
All butterflies in heaven
They will never forget how much I love you
How am I going to do that night?
No one is going to dance like you that night
It is unique thing I ask you
That you know that even if you have gone
You Might Also Like [chorus: Cali & Luis Fonsi]
I don't forget (no)
Even if you are different (even if you are so different)
Although time has passed and you have asked yourself among the people
I don't forget and give everything to see you
Although you are not by my side
I don't get you out of my mind
Come back with me

[Interlude: Cali]
I have cried so many tears
That there are no more
Tell me where you are
You left and I can't live without you
And now that you are not

[Chorus: Cali & Luis Fonsi / both]
I do not forget you
Even if you are different
Although time has passed and you have asked yourself among the people
I do not forget I would give you everything to see you
Although you are not by my side
I don't get you out of my mind
Come back with me
That I do not forget you
