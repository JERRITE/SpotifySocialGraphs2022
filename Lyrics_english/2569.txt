Hero (Unplugged) Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm no superman
I can take your hand
And fly you anywhere you wanna go, yeah
I can read your mind
Like a billboard sign
And tell you everything you wanna hear
But I'll be your hero
[Chorus]
'Cause I, I can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable
I, yeah, I believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul
But if you're the one for me
Then, I'll be your hero
Oh, I'll be your hero, yeah
I'll be your hero

[Bridge]
So incredible
Some kind of miracle
That when it's meant to be
I'll become a hero, oh
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you
Yeah, I'll be your hero

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable
I, yeah, I believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul
But if you're the one for me
I'll be your hero
Yeah, yeah, I'll be your hero, yeah
I'll be your hero
