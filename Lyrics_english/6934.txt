Yours lyrics ["yours"] 

 [Verse] 
 I am the fire that burns your skin 
 I am the water that kills your thirst 
 The castle, the tower I am 
 The sword that keeps the flow 
 You, the air I breathe 
 And the moonlight on the sea 
 The throat that I long for wetting 
 I fear drowning with love 
 "And what wishes are you going to give me?", (Oooh) you say 
 My treasure, just look at him and yours will be, and yours will be " 
 You, the air I breathe 
 And the moonlight on the sea 
 The throat that I long for wetting 
 I fear drowning with love 

 And which desires will you give me? (oooh) 
 You say: "My treasure, just look at him and yours will be, and yours will be." You might also like73embed
