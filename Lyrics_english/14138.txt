Funny Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you mind if I wild out
A little?
'Cause I'm just a little drunk and I wanna come party with you
A little
Can I look into your eyes?
I can tell that you're high too
But that's okay, baby, 'cause I just wanna party with you

[Chorus]
'Cause when we hit the peak, baby
I just wanna party with you
All night
[Verse 2]
Someone hold my phone 'cause I can't hold my tongue
'Cause if I get too drunk, baby, then I'm gonna ruin the fun
That's not your problem, it's because I've seen too much, baby
Sorry if I get a little PTSD

[Chorus]
But I just wanna party with you
All night
Because you make me happy
That's right
I only wanna party with you
Tonight
Because you make everything
