So Much Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I can't lie
I can't fake
I can't act
My hands shake
There's disclosure
I must make

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
There is so much love in me
[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn
In my side
There is something
I can't hide

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
There is so much love in me

[Bridge: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
There's a fire
In my veins
The desire
Causes pain
I will say it
Again
You might also like[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
There is so much love in me

[Bridge: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me1Embed
