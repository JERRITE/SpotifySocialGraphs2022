Cold Cold Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh my love
I know I am a cold cold man
Quite slow to pay you compliments
Or public displayed affections

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby don't you go overanalyze
No need to theorize
I can put your doubts to rest
[Chorus]
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you

[Verse 2]
Oh my love
I know you're used to desperate men
Who say the words that others said
For too long and for too often

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby you can lay off a little bit
No need to smother it
I can put your doubts to rest

[Chorus]
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you
You're the only one worth seeing
The only place worth being
The only bed worth sleeping's the one right next to you

[Post-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Woah oh)13Embed
