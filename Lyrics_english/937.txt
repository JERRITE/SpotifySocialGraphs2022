Why change lyrics [letter of "why change" ft. Plan B]

[Pre-car: Jory Boy]
I don't understand how this happened
And everything changed suddenly
I think a friend, maybe she was a friend
They are dirtying your mind
Or maybe you want to dominate me
If that is, you can forget it
I swear that everything will remain the same
[Chorus: Chencho & Jory Boy]
I don't know why you want me to change
(Time continues and demands me more)
What do you want to force me?
(You are looking to punish you)

So I did not work
You will go crazy
I never excite you
Tell me why you go down with that

I don't know why you want me to change
(Time continues and demands me more)
What do you want to force me?
(You are looking to punish you)

[Verse 1: Maldy]
Our love is physical, we are not boyfriends
Nor friends
We have something, but it's not commitment
I don't know why you insist on putting me in this position
Of decision, talking about illusion
Knowing that yours and mine is passion
Knowing that there is communication when there is temptation
I don't know why you ask me time and dedication
You only live the occasion, enjoy toa 'the mission

What is Perse, why do you persecute me?
(Tell what you get)
If in a short time I may forget
(Tell what you get)
Fifty calls, one million texts
(Tell me what you get)
Give me your body and don't bother me

What happened? Tell me what changed you
No, no, you know how it is me
No, no, you download me with that religion
Tell me what I did on an occasion that this curse fell (curse)

[Chorus: Jory Boy & Cencho]
I don't know why you want me to change
(Time continues and demands me more)
What do you want to force me?
(You are looking to punish you)

And so I did not work
You will go crazy
I never excite you
Tell me then, why you go down with that

[Verse 3: Maldy]
So we are fine, when we want, we have ourselves and get the time to do it
To punishment, you are faithful
You pass it well and I too
And always devouring us like the first time, baby
[Bridge: Chencho]
Give me your body
Do not tell me anything
Why so sad?
If nothing happens
Give me your body
Do not tell me anything
Why so sad?
If nothing happens

[Pre-car: Jory Boy]
I don't understand how this happened
And everything changed suddenly
I think a friend, maybe she was a friend
They are dirtying your mind
Or maybe you want to dominate me
If that is, you can forget it
I swear that everything will remain the same

[Chorus: Chencho & Jory Boy]
I don't know why you want me to change
(Time continues and demands me more)
What do you want to force me?
(You are looking to punish you)

And so I did not work
You will go crazy
I never excite you
Tell me then, why you go down with that

I don't know why you want me to change
(Time continues and demands me more)
What do you want to force me?
(You are looking to punish you)
