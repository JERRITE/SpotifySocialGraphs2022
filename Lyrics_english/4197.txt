Bonita Lyrics [Lyrics for Bonita Ft. J Balvin]

[Intro: J Balvin, Randy]
(Dayme & El High)
She takes a couple of hours.
Call your friend, she doesn't like going out alone
And at night, get carried away, oh ...

[Chorus: Randy, Randy & J Balvin]
Gets hot when listening to this perreo
And I also get hot if I see it
She is so pretty, there so alone
With that belt, dancing close to me
Gets hot when listening to this perreo
And I also get hot if I see it
She is so pretty, there so alone
With that belt, dancing close to me
[Verse 1: jowell]
That they prepare for the party
That the waist giving it candle
Ma ', go to the front and raise that fabric
That this is entered until you hurt you
You are my baby, don't get out of front
Báilalo strong what does people do?
Algarete, no matter people
To 'that's to me, dancing I gave you

And this is not until you are without conscience
Remove your patience and you release your legs
TODAY VAMO 'TO MET YOU
Cool, you have that addiction that makes me and has me

[Chorus: Randy, Randy & J Balvin]
Gets hot when listening to this perreo
And I also get hot if I see it
She is so pretty, there so alone
With that belt, dancing close to me
Gets hot when listening to this perreo
And I also get hot if I see it
She is so pretty, there so alone
With that belt, dancing close to me
