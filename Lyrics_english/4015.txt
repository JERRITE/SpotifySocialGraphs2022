By your side Lyrics [lyrics by your side "]

[Verse 1]
Today your sky is silence and in your eyes the truth
Sleep with the movement of the waves in the sea
Tell me what you are thinking, your cotton face
You remind me so much, you want with my heart

[Chorus]
Give me your hand and keep by your side looking in which star they will be
All the dreams you are drawing to come true
Break silence, smile at fears and tell them that they won't pass
Today hope takes care of you and keeps you and covers you with happiness
[Verse 2]
Every step you are taking becomes illusion
Day by day you win with your hands to pain
Tell me what you are thinking, your cotton face
You remind me so much, you want with my heart

[Chorus]
Give me your hand and keep by your side looking in which star they will be
All the dreams you are drawing to come true
Break silence, smile at fears and tell them that they won't pass
Today hope takes care of you and keeps you and covers you with happiness

[Bridge]
Today I will sing, just for you
This song accompanies you on your trip
And never even find the wings of your freedom

[Chorus]
Give me your hand and keep by your side looking in which star they will be
All the dreams you are drawing to come true
Break silence, smile at fears and tell them that they won't pass
Today hope takes care of you and keeps you and covers you with happiness

[The end]
Break silence, smile at fears and tell them that they won't pass
Today hope takes care of you and keeps you and covers you with happinessyou might also likembed
