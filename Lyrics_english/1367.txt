Borrow Your Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Saturday night, what a wild, wild dream
The room feels like a full-screen cinema
Got you close, got you so, so close
But not for long
So I keep my head down, keep my heart open
'Cause maybe one day, you'll wanna stay
You won't run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Streetlights remind me
Of what it looks like, oh
To hit a dead-end feeling
I don't want to steal it, but
[Chorus]
If I could borrow your time
Lay your soul onto mine (Mine)
We could let go, we could let go
All night, I wanna lose track of life
Find myself in those eyes (Eyes)
Pull you in close, baby, don't go
Hold tight, all night

[Verse 2]
It's such a game, such a cruel, cruel game
To watch my heart like sand through your fingertips
In the meantimе, in the you and me time
Don't lеt it fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Streetlights remind me
Of what it looks like, oh
To hit a dead-end feeling
I don't want to steal it, but

[Chorus]
If I could borrow your time
Lay your soul onto mine (Mine)
We could let go, we could let go
All night, I wanna lose track of life
Find myself in those eyes (Eyes)
Pull you in close, baby, don't go
Hold tight, all night
You might also like[Bridge]
The sun keeps fading on my patience
I'm losing faith, it drives me crazy
My heart keeps racing, can't stop chasing you
The sun keeps fading on my patience
I'm losing faith, it drives me crazy
But I'll keep waiting, can't stop chasing you

[Chorus]
If I could borrow your time
Lay your soul onto mine (Mine)
We could let go, we could let go
All night, I wanna lose track of life
Find myself in those eyes (Eyes)
Pull you in close, baby, don't go
Hold tight (Hold tight to me, hold tight)
All night (All night, baby, all night)
Hold tight (Hold tight to me, hold tight)
All night (All night, baby, all night)

[Outro]
The sun keeps fading on my patience
I'm losing faith, it drives me crazy
My heart keeps racing, can't stop chasing you
The sun keeps fading on my patience
I'm losing faith, it drives me crazy
But I'll keep waiting, can't stop chasing you
(Can't stop chasing you)Embed
