I'm not going to stop Lyrics (feat. Arcangel)

I'm not going to dance my reggaeton, Dan
I'm not going to stop singing my reggaeton, Bailalo
I'm not going to dance my reggaeton, Dan
I'm not going to stop and dance it, dance it

We are not going to guavar the chamaca baby waist
Dance that my reggaeton is not going to stop
The pa'ca miniskirt that baby beef
Dance that my reggaeton is not going to stop
There, that's for you mommy that tastura lady
Like I don't dance, go pana now this is pa gosar
From Puerto Rico very hot for you, I am Jowell and Randy
I'm not going to dance my reggaeton, Dan
I'm not going to stop singing my reggaeton, Bailalo

That Boriqua Bail, Colombians dances it and in Venezuela my reggaeton is danced
With me the carcachas dances it drunk and in Guatemala also for Panama dances my reggaeton
Here dominicanas also dances the Cubans the salvatruchas love my reggaeton
In Chile Mami this is rich by Argentina and Bolivia __ Ecuador my reggaeton is hesitated
And also for Mexico and even Spain everyone dances, everyone dances it

I'm not going to dance my reggaeton, Dan
I'm not going to stop singing my reggaeton, Bailalo
