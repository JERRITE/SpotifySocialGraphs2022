Better Than This Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out of school with no day job
Feeling so far away from
Everything that I used to know (Mm)
They all know what my name is
And treat me like I'm famous
But I still gotta ways to go

[Pre-Chorus]
But knowing my dumb luck
Somebody's gonna wake me up
So until then I'm saying
[Chorus]
Welcome to the good life
Breathing in the sun light
Oh, now everything around me's got that glow
Got me flying so high
Live forever tonight
I'm feeling so deep down in this bliss
Tell me how can things get better than this?
Better than this

[Verse 2]
Don't beep it out what I'm saying
Stupid things, I'm complaining
I'm just tryna make life my own
And whether I sink or swim
I will stay optimistic
I'm still a little bit vulnerable

[Pre-Chorus]
But knowing my dumb luck
Somebody's gonna wake me up
So until then I'm saying

[Chorus]
Welcome to the good life
Breathing in the sun light
Oh, now everything around me's got that glow
Got me flying so high
Live forever tonight
I'm feeling so deep down in this bliss
Tell me how can things get better than this?
Better than this
Better than this
You might also like[Bridge]
Knowing my dumb luck
Somebody's gonna wake me up
So until then I'm saying
I'm saying

[Chorus]
Welcome to the good life
Breathing in the sun light
Oh, now everything around me's got that glow
Got me flying so high
Live forever tonight
I'm feeling so deep down in this bliss
Tell me how can things get better than this?
Better than this

[Outro]
I'm feeling so deep down in this bliss
Tell me how can things get better than this?Embed
