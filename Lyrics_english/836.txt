That part of me Lyrics [lyrics of "that part of me"]

[Stanza: Esteman and Sofía Reyes]
Why am I going to want to hurt your heart?
I don't want to think that damage has already been
Why am I going to want to cause you pain?
That part of me gets out of control

[Pre-Caro: Esteman and Sofia]
They are the nights that take me
To places without barriers
But nothing fracture
What I have with you
[Chorus: Esteman and Sofia]
Forgive me, my love
I do not want to hurt you
Sometimes it is better to shut up
That part of me
Remedy
You're my worship
My eternal dawn
That's why I don't want to hide
That part of me
Remedy

[Verse: Esteman]
I ask you please
Don't make me say more

[Interlude: Elías Mejía]
(Los Angeles Azules, Sofía Reyes and Esteman)

[Stanza: Esteman and Sofía Reyes]
Why am I going to want to get away from you?
There is nothing similar to what we have built
And why am I wanting to sentence our love?
I want to be the whole life for you

[Pre-Caro: Esteman and Sofia]
They are the nights that take me
To places without barriers
But nothing fracture
What I have with you

Remedy
