Donâ€™t Let Me Down (Hardwell & Sephyx Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down
[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, oh no
Say don't let me down
Don't let me down, no-o
Don't let me down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down, down, downYou might also likeEmbed
