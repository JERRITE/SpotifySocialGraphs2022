Try to be better to that old story
That, despite everything, some things remain
The moments lived
Memories that will be
In the deep
Nothing can make you forget
That we walked the same path
And the things we did
It was because we wanted to be
Again in this place
Despite errors
Despite defects and virtues
I keep in me the best
Moments that are going to stay
In the deep
Leave everything and don't think about it anymore
You can't forget what has lived
And your loved ones
They miss you when you are no longer
They don't want to cry
So many times we had to be separated
And feel that despite the distance
We feel the same at any time
Nothing can make you forget
That we walked the same path
And the things we did
It was because we wanted to be
Again in this place
