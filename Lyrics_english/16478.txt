Worried Bout Me Lyrics[Intro:Youngboixander]
(Woah)


[Verse 1:Youngboixander]
You used love me
Nowadays if you look at me
I’m lucky
Cameras started flashin
And now you don’t
___ with me
The boi got a glow up
Now I show up
In double c’s
In double g’s
They always bring up my past tense
And ask me all about my assets
Wanna check out my
Passports and Pateks
Wanna see the body’s in closet
Wanna see the skeletons in the attic
Gossip my name like it’s habit
Spread rumors that are so bat-shit
You always want what you can’t have
No wonder why they mad
They can’t have this
Uh purple rain things
All black mercenary
I’m being questioned bout mob ties
Cause I’m closed off
And I look scary
Money gross as shit
Range Rovers bentley trucks
Porsche Carraras
Love is a fools game
And I refuse to play
I’d rather put some diamonds
All up on my pinky finger
I’ve never trusted a soul
If said that I did then I lied
You can hate and talk shit all you want
But if I die
At least I tried
You hoes gonna go to the grave
And not even been able to say
That you done did something
With your life
I understand there’s no purpose for you
So I just gotta put my pride aside
And realize


[Chorus:Youngboixander]
I heard you’ve been checkin up on me
Heard you’ve been worried bout me
How are you and the boy
That was short lived
You should never doubt me
You wanna come and see me
You wanna see how it is
You wanna be involved now
Nah bitch I’m through with your shit






[Verse 2:Youngboixander]
Yea
Who was the one who put you on a
PJ to Turks and Caicos
And had you exchangin American dollars for pesos
All I asked was that you would lay low
But it wasn’t enough
No its never enough
This is exactly why fo’ I hate you
Mofo’ I made you
I’m the reason your someone today fool
I’m the one who created you
And it’s funny
I see old hoes that I never rocked with
Start to pop up
The same ones who say I will never make it
Are the same who will say there the reason I was brought up
Lil bitch I own you
You were bought up
Your retired
You’ve been washed up
Yea
I don’t even like any of you
I don’t know what you’ve heard
The only ones who will get in the will
Is my boi Remi and like 2 other besties
And they and my mama can have all of my worth
The rest of y’all faker than the ass
On Kimberly
So don’t act like since day one
You was feelin me
Aye
Tell me who I am
30 seconds let’s go right now
You know my image my name
And my face
Other wise lil bitch pipe down
There’s so many things
You’ll never know
My management
Tight like I outsourced
Quantico
You think you got everything on me
But your lookin in a kaleidoscope
Reckless behavior
That’s what they expect of me
Countless fans who switch to haters
You will never get the best of me
I got the sauce bitch
And I’m not sellin the recipe
I’m comin for all of your head tops
The media especially
Bringin up old news
You really thought that would be the death of me
You might also like

[Chorus:Youngboixander]
I heard you’ve been checkin up on me
Heard you’ve been worried bout me
How are you and the boy
That was short lived
You should never doubt me
You wanna come and see me
You wanna see how it is
You wanna be involved now
Nah bitch I’m through with your shit




[Outro:Youngboixander]
Like
Who was there with the umbrella
In the rain for you
When you would get hit by your dad
Who was the one who took care of the pain for you
When no one was there
Who really cared
And who had kept you goin strong and sane through it
When bitches would say shit
Who was the one that was there and kept you still movin
Who was it
It’s funny
I don’t cry anymore I have none left to give
I used to prepare myself for the funeral
Of my mom
When she would just lay in bed
She would have to get nerve blockin
Shots into the back of her head
And can you imagine that
I was just a little kid
Hopin I wouldn’t wake up to her dead
This that
Mom always on the road shit
And never comin home shit
This that
Parents divorced by 3
So I was always alone shit
Callin mama on the phone shit
Breaking glass cause I didn’t know shit
Waitin for mama to come back
Maybe we can go bowling
This that story that made
My heart cold bitch
You worried bout me now
What about way back when
Before I could have you snuck in
And get you exclusive access to the VIPS
Oh now we on the level of best friends
Like I don’t know what you say
When you think phones off
I got eyes and ears everywhere
Don’t even try that bitch
AyeEmbed
