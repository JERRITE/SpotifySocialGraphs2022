FERXXO X ÑEJO LYRICS [LETTER OF "FERXXO X ÑEJO"]

[Pre-car: Feid]
Today I take them and tomorrow I wake up with another
That the cassette is erased because of the note (Yeah)
Thanks to you I turned the hijuepin you hate
Tonight any baby comes out in my stories

[Chorus: Feid]
I'm drunk and I turned on some to fly
When I'm crazy I'm not thinking about calling
I have already eaten everyone and does not know the same
This bastard that I could never forget you
I'm drunk and I turned on some to fly
When I'm crazy I'm not thinking about calling
I have already eaten everyone and does not know the same
He's bastard that I could never forget (tra)
[Verse: ñejo]
(When you want to 'give me' a call)
I already tried to 'color', savor ', size'
How much 'I' have I put 'only this year?
But it always ends 'turning' in my head
That he would arrive in surprise would erase the sadness
That I carry inside the soul, that with glasses' dissimulation
Plus the note, plus fame, plus ass'
But when I get home, I feel that everyone leaves pause
I start thinking and I can't find the cause
For our love to die that way
And if one day they win 'can come whenever you want'
But remember that it is not for you to stay '
It is simply to hesitate for a while, he warns me 'If you dare'

[Bridge: Ñejo]
When you want to 'give me' a call
But remember that there is no love
It's just to have a good time
But you are doing 'when the outburst leave
When you want to 'give me' a call
But remember that there is no love
It's just to have a good time
But you are doing 'when the outburst leave

[Pre-car: Feid]
Today I take them and tomorrow I wake up with another
That the cassette is erased because of the note (Yeah)
Thanks to you I turned the hijuepin you hate (tra)
Tonight any baby comes out in my stories
