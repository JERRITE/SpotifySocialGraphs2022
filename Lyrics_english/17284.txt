Come Into My Room Lyrics[Intro]
Di Genius...

I wanna make love (I want you)

[Bridge: Mavado]
The gyal say her first boyfriend did a live inna dream
Sunday she waan fuck, him gone buy ice cream
No worthless man nuh deh pon the Gully team
The gyal dem see the Gully God and start scream
[Chorus: Stacious (Mavado)]
Baby, come

Come into my room
Take me high
High
Higher than the moon
Baby, come
Come
Come into my room
Mi baby, me a come

With sittin weh fi shift your womb

[Verse 1: Mavado (Stacious)]
Mi gyal, bend over, me a give you from back
Me have the key fi your padlock
Mi love a run over, you say, "Baby, nuh stop!"
You sweat 'til you weak, you draw fi your mop
Sexy likkle ting
Pretty likkle pet
Come, make we go... (Do it!)
Two of we go buss a sweat
I'm here to end your stress and bring you sexual hapiness
We nuh have no secret fi keep, make we confess
We rolling in the jeep...
Your fingers on my breasts
People coulda see it...
But I coulda care less
Dying to get in between the sheets...
Mi baby...
Dem done know the rest

[Verse 2: Mavado]
It get no calmer
Sex is drama
She pull off nighty, me pop off pajama
Sexy Stacious from the Gully corner
Say she waan ride it like a Yamaha
Think a one time me wuk off Tishawna?
Inna the middle of the room or in a corner
Put her in a coma or a trauma
From a gyal ting, Gully God run on yah
The girls dem know I'm a hard performer
Have gyal inna mi house a sing Soprano
Sexy Joanna from Botswana
Me and her... make love a Ghana

For all you sexy girls out there (I want you)
Just want to let you know

You know what I think about...
Our two naked bodies pressed against each other
