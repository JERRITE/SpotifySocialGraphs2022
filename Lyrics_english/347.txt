Sorry 4 What? // LV BELT Lyrics[Intro]
I'm not tryna be here for a long time
Just, just a good, good time
I got a lot of shit weighin' on my mind
Weighin' on my mind

[Verse]
So fuckin' serious, you niggas' delirious
Said it wit' exclamation, but niggas can't fuck wit' me, period
Bitch, right off the back, I need y'all to flex
All of this stuntin' look good for my ex
All of these zeros look good on my checks
I got like two or three phones for business and bitches and still can't even answer a text
Yeah, we in the spot, we won't give it a rest
They be sayin' that that liquor gon' catch up to you
Nigga, it ain't caught up to me yet
I hit the road, I look like the mayor
Countin' up fifties and twentiеs and tens
I'm out of state, they givе me a ten
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
Ballin' again, again, again, again, again
That was the plan again, bitch, I'm the man again
Walk out of Louis, it look like a mannequin
All the store management wanna know how much I spend, I spend, yeah
I don't fuck wit' her, she fiesty
All of the niggas that's wit' me are shiesty
This is the reason these niggas don't like me, yeah
I gotta win, I gotta hit from the back when it's pricy
I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna fuck wit' a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B
I'm on a roll like the motherfuckin' dice be
I'm catchin' pussy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' pussy like it was a flight
I'm in your city, what's up for the night?
[Chorus]
I, I've had way too much to drink, you know, I
1942, it ain't on me, sing to five
Ex callin' up my phone, fuckin' up the vibe
Tonight's not the night, tonight's not the—
Yeah (Yeah), fuck that bitch, yeah (Uh)
Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick, yeah (Uh)
Louis V belt, yeah (Yeah), Louis V belt, yeah (Uh)

Hop on the couch, yeah (Yeah), take me a flick (Woah), yeah (Yeah)
