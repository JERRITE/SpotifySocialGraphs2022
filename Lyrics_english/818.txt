MINIFALDA LYRICS [LETTER OF "MINIFALDA"]

[Verse 1: Greeicy]
He put the miniskirt, the one he liked so much
The one that was no longer put, because he did not leave her
Get tired of promises, to wait for a day to change
That's why today goes partying, and will not return tomorrow

[Pre-Caro: Juanes]
It is no longer interested
Keep on the same
And I said everything well
This only the beginning
[Chorus: Greeicy & Juanes]
Because life continues as if nothing
And don't waste time, because it ends
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt
Life continues as if nothing
And what does not work, because he leaves
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt

[Post-Coro: Greeicy & Juanes]
The loves that do not rhyme are better from afar
And those who hurt that they do not give advice
For forget and forget
You have to drink, you have to dance

[Verse 2: Greeicy & Juanes]
Uploading to this song
And let it let there be another love
If it hurts that it hurts
That you are better, but far
That you are better, but far
Uploading to this song
And let another love arrive
If it hurts that it hurts
That you are better, but far
You are better, but far away

Because life continues as if nothing
And don't waste time, because it ends
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt
Life continues as if nothing
And what does not work, because he leaves
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt

[Instrumental interlude]

[Pre-Caro: Greeicy]
It is no longer interested
Keep on the same
I said everything well
This only the beginning

[Chorus: Greeicy & Juanes]
Because life continues as if nothing
And don't waste time, because it ends
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt
Life continues as if nothing
And what does not work, because he leaves
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt
[Post-Coro: Greeicy & Juanes]
The loves that do not rhyme are better from afar
And those who hurt that they do not give advice
Just remember that life is short
Much shorter than your miniskirt
