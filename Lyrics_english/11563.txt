Something Has to Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
You caught the same train
And you took it back
To the same place
You're back where you started
It's the same thing
You keep trying to do something different
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
[Verse 2]
And it's the same thing
You're repeating yourself
And it's the same girl who's giving you hell
And it's the same face
Your heart keeps breaking in the same place

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change

[Bridge]
And it's the same thing
You're repeating yourself
And it's the same girl who's giving you hell
And it's the same face
Your heart keeps breaking in the same place

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
You might also like[Verse 3]
And you look back
You're going 'round in circles
Your world feels just the same
Your heart keeps breaking in the same way

[Chorus]
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change
Something has to change3Embed
