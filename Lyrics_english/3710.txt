Dua Lipa feat. Hwa Sa - Physical (Remix) [English Translation] Lyrics[Verse 1: Hwa Sa]
Even though we are studying each other's minds
Do you know that you have already revealed your inner thoughts?
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You who are trying to cheat my feelings
There's no time, you're just wasting time
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree, bae?

[Pre-Chorus: Hwa Sa]
Who needs to go to sleep
When I got you next to me?
[Chorus: Hwa Sa, Dua]
The night goes by
There's no meaning to hide it further more
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Closing the room doors
In the space where there's only two of us
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical

[Verse 2: Dua]
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

[Pre-Chorus: Dua]
Who needs to go to sleep
When I got you next to me?

[Chorus: Dua]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Hold on, you and me, chemistry
Come on, hold on, I can't refuse
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter, come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready, come on
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

[Chorus: Dua]
All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out and follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Let's get physical

[Outro: Dua, Both]
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physicalEmbed
