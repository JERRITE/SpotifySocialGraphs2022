Freestyle France - Belgium Lyrics [Intro: Lomepal and Caballero]
And, yah yah
Jeannine, already platinum, swelling
Jeannine, platinum, it rhymes so well!
AIE Aie Aie

[Refrain 1: Lomepal]
Forget my birthday, I no longer need anything
I am the quietest of my team, smashed from evening to morning
We go back all day and my morale is full
But it's just enough to last until the next day
[Verse 1: Lomepal]
Adrenaline in the heart after full scenes
We dredge, we are exposed, not uncommon for the sex for, very rare that the meters are leaning
My cock makes me face: I didn't talk enough about her in my last sque-d '
You would like to know if I am that an actor or if I fuck as in my songs, let’s get it
I'm going to make you cum four times, sleep four hours and I will always have the energy to go skate
I am in love every day but it lasts that the night following
What unforgivable lover, too bad, I still keep my head high like my cover, ouh
I say: "The only thing that matters is making a licked album"
I agrees to finish it and I feel light when I give it to Gopher
In real life, I don't like to work, I put forward more than in pairs
Before, I wanted to be Donald Glover, now I just want to be Childish Gambino
Look at me in my best life, in my best movie
I do my best concerts in the best cities
I take the world behind my best window then, I go home to finally find my best vacuum
Yassine is my little brother, Caba ', he's my big brother
I have a lot of them to think when I trapped on the screen, brother
I have to fuck everything for them even if I have cramps, brother
Comb me their mouths in a large fresco

[Refrain 2: Lomepal]
Hey, other than that I need nothing
I am the quietest of my team, smashed from evening to morning
We go back all day and my morale is full
But it's just enough to keep up to the next day
You might also like [verse 2: Caballero]
I'm superman in a bat-mobile, huh; Count the bundles: one of my hobbies, huh
Comfortable in rap like the word "cock", huh, because I did ch'min like this hobbit, huh
If you peel me with the ring on the finger, I would see, mmh, that is still the Lord of the Rings, huh
You have become a beautiful shit, huh, by listening to everything you teach you these sluts, huh
You see me on stage and in your computer, huh, but I'm elsewhere like Rick and Morty
Drugs send me to seventh heaven, the descent does not scare me because there is the ass of my bitch which amortized
What is it beautiful in his shorty, ouh, I put on slaps, I nibble him
I come from vacation, our skin colors are matching
It is a rebeu: for the per-cho, I said that I called Nordine
When it's a bud, my name is Paul-Émile, do you want buzz? Calls shhh and creates controversy
They try to catch up with us but their thighs and their calves sting, they will be delighted with our radio freestyles, will say that it was too epic
Because living, it's dying, I want to see mom more crying, I never want to see Zemmour again
What ? Sad boy because living, it's dying, I don't want to see mom crying anymore, I never want to see Zemmour again

[Verse 3: Jeanjass]
I just come from bled, black glasses like in Blade
I'm with your girl under the pled, yeah, it's JJ, yeah, it's JJ
Didn't you buy Jeannine? It's loose; rappers mowing my lawn
Who is the pope of Charlouze? Yeah, it's JJ, yeah, it's JJ
It's phew what I live in it, it's been a lease that I have not freestylé
Take advantage of it, soon, I leave, yeah, niquerdesmeres.com, this is the website
2019, writing rhymes is useless, you're not stylish enough to make my hand shake
When the girl is annoying, I punish her: "You will be deprived of Cunni '"
You have to beat the iron as long as it is hot, I am moving in Paris every weekend like yellow vests
Hélico 'on the roof, it's not leasing, young and jénialissime
not a word
[Refrain 2: Lomepal]
Hey, other than that I need nothing
I am the quietest of my team, smashed from evening to morning
We go back all day and my morale is full
But it's just enough to keep up to the next day

[Verse 4: Romeo Elvis]
They just deserve me to kicker so there is no problem
I'm in production, a bit like Marc Dorcel
I have a pure flow of bx, in the tram, I listen to another playlist
I don't all have telechum, I don't understand the program, what is it?
Young tains-p 'are giving each other table and would like us to take a photo with their anorak
It's crazy, it's not yet clear, me it's only Lacoste and Caba ', it's only Ralph Lauren
Pouf, magic, the verses are square as if it was done by a machine
It's easy, with my poubelle songs, I will get gold in a few months but I have room for the walls to hang decks
Eden strikes in London, Michy hits Valence, Thomas knocks in Paris, it's the big avalanche
The seum of the semi-final, I had to swallow it, especially when I understood that I was rich, it was thanks to France, ok
Incredible concert [?] I am a royal cat [?]
But I don't price the 1 trip ticket, oops, it's true, I'm fraud
Oops, it's true, sorry, I was listening to my project
They just deserve me to kicker then there is R, frangin
If these are technical texts, it will be done endless, it is my specialty
Rap and me is the cover of Paris-Match, edition Læticia Hallyday
That's it, that's all I wanted to say, ok
I make the rappers crumble under the titles, ok
I get wet the hens and the micht ', ok
I want to represent Jul for streams, ok
That's how it is, that's all I wanted to say, ok
I meet, I make collapse under the titles, ok
I get wet the hens and the micht ', ok
I want to represent Jul for streams, ok

[Verse 5: Slimka]
Child of sandboxes, I agree that we are good at that to that
You dance the waka waka to impress Natacha
You and me it's not the same O.G. Like Waka Flocka
You are no longer waka [?] We know that you flop
Ah, sometimes I want
You, you say that the shit [?] Do not say they say
I could have a role of phew in the movies, okay, with it the poufs behind me hallucinate
I swear, I want to ride nev'juice in [?] Lexus visières, Nexus
Her calls me Easy, she says the zizi, okay
She wants refrains, I sing like Ziggy
De-Spi as in the Ferrari, to drive, I put the gloves
Naughty as a mela-melanine, my daron, it's laminated
Why are you doing the G? You are [?] Five floors, bitch
[?] So please, don't worry
I come from Palm Trees, she did not understand yet, I have to take it far from here, far from my country
Like my shanty, his skin is soft as the chanta '
I'm nice to her we test the champis
[?] Her bed is little, small
CRISS CROSS pants, I say that I am not available
I feel like Tony M., I feel that Go loves me, Shine
But is it ready for a story like Bonnie & Clyde?

[Refrain 3: Lomepal]
I need nothing
I am the quietest of my team, smashed from evening to morning
We go back all day and my morale is full
But it's just enough to keep up to the next day

[Verse 6: Isha]
Full bazaar in your ree-self, we are known for that
Everyone goes through it, my nougat sellers
My sneakers are white, you shouldn't have me
The whole city has the juice, we are known for that
I do rap, after, I'm going to write books
Ergo 'du Bled, we finish all our sentences with "or else"
Hey, I have a plan: I am the sector
The l'll be gone 'til november
Yeah, I think they are very afraid
She caresses me, she says that I have a baby's skin
Before, she didn't love me because I liked it too much
We arrive in winter, I find the best flows than the summer
I'm creative, I have the best prose, yeah
You're popular but in real life, you slammed
You take the microphone, you make displaced gestures
No, better not stay angry
You happen, you play the thugs, you are in spare parts

[Verse 7: Isha]
I know where to find my friends, we do not take each other
When I'm in a good mood, I do good jokes
I'm more with the girl: she took up too much space
When the Negro is not happy, the negro SESCASSE
Boubous, dreads, locks, braids
It's always the same, oh, it's true
We play on the traitors, lying in front of the ground
I tear on your neck, I launch a socket on your buttocks, Time

[Verse 8: Romeo Elvis]
Give me a verse to calm half the middle
Give me two verses to shorten what I have humiliated too
I'm fine with my blase like estez with Emilio
If we compare talent, guy, I already find a thousand leagues
I go to the field like the spoon in the ice ball
I burn the charts to more than a thousand degrees
And the talent of the whores is that of double-sided, what? What ?
I do this music for my mouth so the purists open their mouths
If they are only interested at the beginning, I will talk about the hole of my reum
I praise those who will spit on our progress saying: "It's salesperson" because it's not French rap
Or "it's rap for the iEn-Cli"
In general, those who use "ients-cli" are on Twitter to hide their head of Ient-Cli
Or it is a little frustrated city guys who do not appreciate my success
Because my fanbase is white the more she is nice
Ok, your music is democratizing
You don't want us to get back and that, it appeals to racists
I don't have rap for whites, like showcase, opening
But my audience is rarely mixed out of festivals
Ok, your music is democratizing
And you don't want us to get ourselves, it appeals to racists
I don't have rap for whites, like showcase, opening
But my audience is rarely mixed out of festivals

[Verse 9: Jeanjass]
First, I fuck you, they said that we wouldn't do it, it was only a mess
JJ, Caba ', it's pogos, it's queues, discomfort
JJ, Caba ', it's okay as money and case
I have the best herbs, taste them, if you don't know who I am, you should google me
In the street, I am easily recognized, I can't miss me like a pair of huge buttocks
Wow, wow, I'm going to shoot them, I think, in ambush as if I were behind the line with three points
Since the first time I took a microphone, I want to close all the doors like a migrant
Today, you can no longer ignore us, we are too big but I always have the fangs, kho
Strong like Hercules, no one failed, tain, you stuck the little one like R. Kelly
You thought it was the end of the verse, admits, it stinks when you open your mouth
I love to see you Jacqueter on the networks, it entertains me even more than these libertine installs
I agree that this world is fucked, I have evidence, I have thousands of examples
Today, to succeed is to humiliate others
What will you do if tomorrow, it rains bombs?
That's all for me, ciao, hold on
not a word

[Verse 10: Lomepal]
Each week, I hurt somewhere but I avoid calling the 15th, why?
I don't really like telling someone's services so I pretend to know how to do everything
But life is that in red fires, I donate to me the glasses of Sam Fisher to have them all green
With me, nothing is light but escape, it's expensive
I say two liters of water a day but my heart is dried up
So my bad-me is unlocked with his chains and gets to fuck all the rest of the world
Watch me do filth gestures
I already sit down the next buffoon that will go
Sober, so I bored it impossible that I write on an empty stomach
In addition, alcohol replaces heating, huh
I am a savage, except that I am angry, I felt nothing when I visited his vagina
But I did like when I'm on stage: I gave everything, as if it was the right one, as if I was going to make him a newborn baby
So human, I had to be crowned, know that we hate both old known pouffes as the binder kids
You know us, I can't play it slower
Vital points, it's to put your first ko and then sing "1st gaou" before the end of the first round
I'm a Peace boy but brother, I have lots of stories with people
So, I answer with the legs, you must not confuse weak and kind, especially when chaos reigns
Jeannine everything, in all environments, it's word of mouth
But nothing happens by chance, I accelerate just like a chemist, the balls large like a skull, brain in eruption like Jimmy
In 2008, I missed my bac ', 2018, I am double platinum, put back from the sauce in my meal dish, I am hungry
[Verse 11: Caballero]
2019 is my time, I'm going to buy an Audemar Piguet
Your girl is good like Shakira, huh, we're going to sting you
I put my chavrou in the pussy of fighter plane, yeah I admit, it's normal that you are jealous
But I stop as soon as I gave barbados singer
She have wet dreams where they touch my barba
I am moving the shit, no, I'm not leaving
No, I don't know what, what do you know, hey?
If I want to travel without traveling, I turn on the zkittlez
If I want to travel in first class, I do a single
Nique the president as well as the commissioner
They want to make me back like a desert eagle
Wow, Caballero, you're really an O.G
When she realized it, I fucked it all the noche
Ugly and nasty, nan, rather "gordo y guapo", phew
Pass Guava, phew, I do a hit like Quavo, phew
I don't want to disappear as a tragedy
So I have art, not trap, I said
I do art and dollars while raging, they rage, rage to the point where they tears the tifs
Mama, we made it, I succeeded and wallah I get a smile if one of my haters succeeded
If I have a crisis and I am unlikely that I am hearing
So I try to be good every day like Mohammed or Jesus Christ
I have been nostalgic since I have [?] I hate turf
I was told: "You saw nothing coming because of the grass than you smoke"
But I don't want a slower life, champagne, diamond and a Russian girl, the cash virus is very virulent
But I still think of the oppressed, those with very bres-som destiny that end with the broken bones
I dragged all night with Lomepal and Mokhtar
The next day, I was a rock star, Yah
Caballero

[Verse 12: MOKA BOKA]
I write a million things, yes, hey
And his cute girlfriend, that's how
Make the error like the pillar, I am strong
I know how to do it, humiliate the opponent
If you're too close to me, I say: "Push"
Find me anywhere, yes, that's how
Similar, you and I are not until it
Similar, you and I are not until it
Hey, I write things, yeah, oh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
M.O.KA B.O.KA, YEAH, UH
M.O.KA B.O.KA, YEAH, UH
M.O.KA B.O.KA, YEAH, UH
M.O.KA B.O.KA, YEAH, UH
I'm paranoid and paranoid and yes, it's true ...

[Verse 13: Isha]
Inwardly, we lead all kinds of war
A black flag behind an iron throne
Make my entry into the third verse
I count the last potato
We have never touched Colombian's drug, we only talk about butter rooster and big butt
As if I was in the Star Wars vessel at the time when the Negros turned their clips to the car-wast
Braided hair like in the time of Bow Wow
Damn

[Verse 14: Lomepal]
Generation ballin ', lose all on an all-in
Nothing is solid, life is a huge school courtyard
We do the opposite of what should do the police where madness lacks
I don't like you but I'm well brought up, if I fuck your mother for you, I do it politely
Luxury or unemployment, lobster or ricard
We are good to party as in Kusturica films
But I would be what to do if a sign is a sign
Improvise, I was good, I made my clips with Adrien, Momo and Yassine
And Dario, my liver is fragile like an empty demonstration
I have to love my dirty manies quickly
I learned nothing, I still vomited on it like a student
Outside, I am repugnant
Inside, I'm beautiful
Fuck the big boat, we lead our own boat
There is a need for Thuns and the Devil wants to make us a propal
There is what it takes to forget in the brown bag
We only talk about girls but we spend most of our time between men as in the Brokeback mountains
As long as the rhyme takes me in something less annoying
Smoking, it creates connections but it gives me too many questions
That's why I need to drink at the same time, hey, hey
This super planet leaves in this lukewarm
But the devil continues to repeat to me that there is never enough sugar there
Must fall day and night, seven out of seven
We improve but the achievements will never be acquired enough to rest from SSUS, Hey
By dint of repeating how to repair the flaws, my voice is
I have serious techniques
If we forced all these little sluts of presidents to take ayahuasca, the planet would be better
Too bad we have to have that to open your eyes
My fellows want to make Thuns before seeing the last night cover the heavens
You're different, stop your jokes, you're cute, even you, you will do everything to have billions if one day you win millions (Hey, Hey)
I do not say that it is a good reasoning but provided that I am expanding everything with real friends (Ouh)
Find a good reason to have lived, we are almost there, together we will live, together we will burn until the last embers
Squad until death like ... embed
