You taught me (remix) Lyrics [letter from "you taught me (remix)"]

[Enter: Sael]
(Maybe it was the last time)
(This is the remix)
You left your perfume
And my bed now smells like you
You asking me
And I smoke thinking about you
How do I know? I dont know
Maybe it was the last time, maybe
Maybe it was the last time
[Chorus: Sael]
You taught me to eat you, from
But you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What the hell can I claim?
You taught me to eat you, from
And you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What the hell can I claim?

[Verse 1: duki]
(Duko, Oh-Oh!)
I talked to my pillow and says it is surprising
For love I have a sixth sense, as a spider -man
Ours is a mirror that lies tarnish
At this point I am iron, your little game 'do not harm me
Your memory will keep it in the roll of a kodak
That I do not plan to reveal why fashion
I studied your whole body and did not give me the diploma
I am a grandfather from nothing, I waited for more than a thousand hour '
And you changed me, like the spark of a clipper
That for you gave everything like Allen to the Sixers
You had the treasure key and you lost it
There is no other like me, 'it is not going to be repeated (you already knew)
Since you were not relaxing or mari (no-oh)
The 'microdosis of your kiss' are necessary
I went from the five star hotel 'to live in Safari (OH-OH)
I was your Eiffel Tower and you were my Paris (Duko)

You taught me to eat you, from
But you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What damn can I claim?
You taught me to eat you, from
And you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What the hell can I claim?

[Verse 2: Sael]
(The kid, call me)
Flaca, I'm still on the straight way and although I did the right
I am the architect of your incorrect sides
You were my sun, but now it was done at night
And I don't want you to feel this song like a reproach, but
I'm looking for you desperate, yah
On the whole side 'and I have not found you
I want to feel you again
Forty degree 'outside and you still have the chore freeza'o
I'm still looking for you desperate, yah
On the whole side 'and I have not found you
I want to feel you again, ma '

[Chorus: Duki & Sael]
(Because you taught me to eat, from you)
But you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What damn can I claim?
You taught me to eat you, from
And you didn't teach me to forget
I didn't play, but pa 'ti was a joke
What the hell can I claim?
[Outro: Sael & Duki]
