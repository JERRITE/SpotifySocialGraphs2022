Damn stupidity lyricssabes well that I gave you what I am
And your love is alms and pain
I was a lover without love
It's just not ask me forgiveness

Look, you are alone again
And look at me, that my fault is not
Stop tormenting my heart
Store that I don't want to see you anymore

There is no one in this world to do so much damage
I was silly, I did not deny it you could convince me
And you come and you lie to me while we go hand in hand
You're sure you have me at your feet
Damn stupidity

I wanted to make you happy
But the problem is that you don't want to be happy
I forgot to me that I also wanted to be
And I am not falling back
I will not say that there will be no one better than me
If there are
But I doubt that someone creates in you like me
How could I endure

Today I will say that I regret
To live time with you
Maybe I can only imagine
The truth is that I never look at you

I hope you learn to distinguish

Between love, ego, hatred and passion
I forget you just because I hate you
It was just like a click obsession

Worst of all, you know perfectly you are bad
And you walk to the people you are faithful
Don't say you miss me because I don't believe you anything
I know that your attitude is your greatest stupidity

I wanted to make you happy
But the problems is that you don't want to be happy
I forgot, I forgot me too that I also wanted to be
And I am not falling back
I will not say that there will be no one better than me
If there are
But I doubt that someone creates in you like me
How could I endure

I wanted to make you happy
But the problem is that you don't want to be happy
I forgot, I forgot me too that I also wanted to be
And I promise I do not fall again
I will not say that there will be no one better than me
If there are
But I doubt someone to see in you what you
You could never give me

And I forgot € ¦
I hate so muchmbed
