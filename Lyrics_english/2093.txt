Who’s In Your Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You moved like magic, you moved like time
You had your heart disguised
When you cry diamonds, yeah, they shine
But they blind my eyes, and now

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I'm dreaming
Now, tell me, baby, were you ever mine?
[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
I wanna know who’s in your head?
Stealing your heart while I'm still bleeding
Who's in your bed?
Wrapped in your arms while I ain’t sleeping
Got lost in your halo (Halo)
I just wanna know
Now, who's in your head? In your head? (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You moved like danger, but I don't mind (Yeah, yeah)
The way you talking with your eyes, yeah (Your eyes)
You leave me broken, no I can't lie (Can't lie)
It gets me every time, and now

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I'm dreaming
Now, tell me, baby, were you ever mine?

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
I wanna know who's in your head?
Stealing your heart while I’m still bleeding
Who’s in your bed?
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleeping
Got lost in your halo (Halo)
I just wanna know
Now, who’s in your head? In your head? (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

You get me down
On my knees
On my knees, yeah
You drive me wild
When you want
When you want it?
Oh you get me down
On my knees
On my knees, yeah
'Cause every time I look into your eyes
(Look into your eyes)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
I wanna know who's in your head?
Stealing your heart while I’m still bleeding
Who's in your bed?
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleeping
Got lost in your halo (Halo)
I just wanna know
Now, who's in your head? In your head? (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
In your head, still bleeding
In your head, while I'm sleeping
In your head, still bleeding
In your head, while I'm sleeping8Embed
