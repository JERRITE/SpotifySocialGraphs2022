Even without you, I will ask reasons, I do not ask you explanation
I don't need to hear a thousand words
I just know what ended
And although you were everything in me
So much love exists in me
I know well that today I don't have you anymore
It is enough for me to have me
Even without you, my world does not stop, life will continue
The stars are still shining
I know that nothing will change
Even without you, my most beautiful and deep dream I will find
And although you were my greatest reason
Even without you I'm still standing
I will not ask reasons, I do not ask you explanation
I don't need to hear a thousand words
I just know what ended
And it won't be so easy, be immune to my pain
Just a moment of calm to end your love
And although I know you were all
So much love exists in me
I know well that today I don't have you anymore
It is enough for me to have me
Even without you, my world does not stop, life will continue
The stars are still shining
I know that nothing will change
Even without you, my most beautiful and deep dream I will find
And although you were my greatest reason
Even without you I'm still standing
Even without you, my world not for life will continue
The stars are still shining
I know that nothing will change
Even without you my most beautiful and deep dream I will find
And although you were my biggest reason
Even without you I'm still standing
I'm still standing
Even without you my most beautiful and deep dream I will find
And although you were my biggest reason
Even without you I'm still on PIEYOU MIGHT ALSO Likeembed
