I Know Him So Well LyricsNothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much
For far too long

Looking back
I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments
Who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know
I know him well
Wasn't it good?
(Oh so good)
Wasn't he fine?
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine?
But in the end
He needs a little bit
More than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No-one in your life is with you constantly
No-one is completely on your side
And though I'd move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide

Looking back
(Looking back)
I could have played it differently
(I could have played it some other way)
Learned about the man
Before I fell
(I was just a little careless)
But I was ever so much younger then
(Maybe, so much younger then)
Now at least I know
I know him well
You might also likeWasn't it good?
(Oh so good)
Wasn't he fine?
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?

Didn't I know?
How it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?

Wasn't it good
Wasn't he fine?
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?

But in the end
He needs a little bit
More than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took time to understand him

I know him so wellEmbed
