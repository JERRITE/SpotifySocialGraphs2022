Do You Love Me?2011 Remastered Version LyricsI Found Her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I’d love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the various sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me?
She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside hеr
I still seemed obsolete
I found god and all his dеvils inside her
In my bed she casts the blizzard out
A mock sin blazed ion her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle jangle

Do you love me?
He had a heart full of love and devotion
She had a mindful of Tyranny and terror
Well I try I do I really try
But I just err baby I do I error
So come find me my darling one
I’m down to the grounds the very Dregs
Ah here she comes blocking the sun
Blood running down the side of her leg
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle

Do you love me?
All the things move toward their end
I knew before I met her taht I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I swear I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangleYou might also likeEmbed
