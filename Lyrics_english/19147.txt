Throw Some D’s (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah
I used to think about immature things
You know, like, "Do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?"
Wait a minute motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Ain't a hood nigga, but a nigga from the ho-od
See, mama stayed on me so I turned out pretty go-od
But if you wanna try, sucker now then we can do it
Ha-ha, sleep, Tylenol PM if I pull it
Sh-sh-sheep, count 'em for the rest of ya life
Yeah, yeah your partner got away, but now he vegetable-like
So-so I sent his mom and dad a whole case of V8
He can die any second, how much longer it's 'gon take?
Go and get it over with, oh, what if you were in my loafers then?
You might be the dope, but I would flush it down the toilet
Like the boys in blue when they come through with them boots
And they kickin' down the door and they don't care who they shoot
But we do care who they shoot, so we do what we must do
So we act like we run track, then we run straight to the back
But they comin' from the back, so we run back to the front
They say get down on ya knees, we say, "What the fuck you want?"
They want cheese, they want bread, they want dough, they want mo'
Than I wanna give 'em, but if I keep talkin' they won't know
That my cousin in the back, and we call him Roto-Rooter
Slash plumber, cash runner and he fire on them computers, log out
[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw— throw—
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Shout out to Rich Boy, we all wanna be rich, boy
Alabama bricks boy tryin' to get them big toys
Two-twelve motorin', tell Harry throw some Ds on that bitch
Now I'm gettin' fly, couple Gs on the fit
I'm at the jeweler now, throw some freeze on a bitch
I got a chest cold and I might sneeze on the bitch
We at the strip club, we throw some Gs on that bitch 'cause we ballin'
We all outcasts, hot cars, we coppin' cash
Chop shop, the added stash, cop cars can kiss my ass
The car wash, my whip's glowin', no tints, we fish bowlin'
No top, the piff's blowin', throw some Ds on that bitch
And we go hard, Zone 4, d-boy squad
We don't need the bars, kosher's lawyer, baby, just to beat the charge
We got a fetish coppin' speedy cars, charge it to my Visa card
They never thought that we'd get large (Yo)

Lunatics sittin' fat, St. Louis on the map
Sixty-nine wet black, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some Ds on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some Ds on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
How could I slip, how could I fall
When you're baby mama got my poster high up on her wall?
And that ain't all, she done gave me them drawers
I'm Murphy Lee, please tell your sexy little sister I called
Last time she asked me for some money, I was hell to the nah
But now I'm rich and she can get it
See these Ds match my fitted, my paint is banana splitted
Inside is totally ig'nant, outside is totally kitted
To be specific it's wicked how them Derrty Boyz did it
That Buick Regal done did it, my Monte Carlo's terrific
That El Dorado got switches, Tamika and them, I done hit it
That twenty mill', I done spent it, that house on the hill, I live it, man
And that diamond herringbone? (You know them niggas did it)
Walk up in the strip club, lookin for a big butt
Shawty wanna get fucked, I brought about ten, what?
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten, what?
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten, what?

[Chorus: Rich Boy & Lil Jon]
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac (Let's go), ayy
[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
It's Rich Boy, baby girl, I'm a baller
I dropped a hit and had to go park my Impala
I threw some Ds on that 'Lac and now it's taller
They see the wheels on my de Ville and so they holla
Let's get this dollar, I got the fat man 'Lac
Took it to the paint shop and got the fat man black
I hold my jacket with my Tokyo Adidas on
Ho, don't even call my phone if you ain't gonna give me dome
So fuck you haters, I'll see you later
Might see the gator in my Escalade, uh
Mama told me, "Put some Ds on it, son, you ridin' wrong"
So I took them twenties off and put the monster wheels on

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw— throw—
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw— throw—

[Verse 5: The Game]
All red Chevrolet, twenty-sixes ridin' high
Dukes of Hazzard doors, in Compton we call 'em suicides
Suede roof, leather seats, woodgrain steering wheel
Candy apple hard-top, Game logo on the grill
California license plate ridin' through the ATL
Keep my tires bald, I never leave a paper trail
Nah, I'ma keep it clean, ball when I hit the scene
Elbow out the window, show 'em how to gangsta lean
Put Cali on the map, west side on my back
Hometown on my face, forty-five on my lap
Twenty in my earlobe, hundred on my neck piece
Just bought a Bentley, nigga, and I'ma throw some Ds on that bitch
Pull up at the rim shop and throw some Ds on that bitch
Might as well cut the top
Let the sunshine in and the bass jump out
Hit the block, fifteens vibratin' the whole fuckin' house

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac7Embed
