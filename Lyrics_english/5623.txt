I Hope Itâ€™s Not Like This Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't be the only one
Unsatisfied and wanting more
Than serving drinks for no money
Oh, what a modern tragedy
A Friday night, a creeping gloom
That's when life threw me you
And from that day you owned me
Feel like I did at eighteen

[Chorus]
Honey, you're pretty, you're gorgeous
You're practically perfect, you're flawless
And to think that right now you're a stranger
I hope it's not like this forever
[Verse 2]
I can't be the only one
Unsatisfied and wanting more
Than playing understudy
In my own dark comedy
And that is why when I saw you
I couldn't help but start to play through
You dancing in the kitchen
A drunk midnight rendition

[Chorus]
Honey, you're pretty, you're gorgeous
You're practically perfect, you're flawless
And to think that right now you're a stranger
I hope it's not like this forever

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Honey, you're pretty, you're gorgeous
You're practically perfect, you're flawless
And to think that right now you're a stranger
I hope it's not like this forever
You might also like[Outro]
No, I hope it's not like this foreverEmbed
