Ziplock lyrics [intro]
Brr-Rra, Missed Calls, CHK-CHK

[Hook]
My feelings fit for you in a ziplock
Transparent plastic covers the tipblock
Thousands of Missed Calls are under my news
Ring, ring, ring, ring

[Part 1]
Role my worries in the paper until I'm high
There is better than despair on the shit
Scratch the rest together
Maybe I'll get two of it
It makes me not alone
I think I'm addicted
Because you alone, have not been happy for a long time
I know it sounds crazy
And I think there is no back
Everything else is of no use
[Hook]
My feelings fit for you in a ziplock
Transparent plastic covers the tipblock
Thousands of Missed Calls are under my news
Ring, ring, ring, ring
My feelings fit for you in a ziplock
Transparent plastic covers the tipblock
Thousands of Missed Calls are under my news
Ring, ring, ring, ring

[Part 2]
A train and the world switches off
With the crew and the fans keep me awake
No matter where I am, whether in the trap or in the coffin
I smoke while standing and I smoke in the grave
You are in me and you don't go away either
Everyone knows how such a mistake injured
State the Pain, I put the pape licked
Please, one is so friendly and passed the Lighter, Lighter, Lighter, Ah, Continue, Continue, Continued
You know that I have the hot shit, yes

[Hook]
My feelings fit for you in a ziplock
Transparent plastic covers the tipblock
Thousands of Missed Calls are under my news
Ring, ring, ring, ring
My feelings fit for you in a ziplock
Transparent plastic covers the tipblock
Thousands of Missed Calls are under my news
Ring, ring, ring, Ringyou Might So Like3embed
