We Got a Problem LyricsWe got a little problem and we can’t grow up
We’re spending all our time getting so messed up
The girlfriend's gone for a weekend retreat
I got three whole days to get back on my feet
Stop taking these crazy little yellow letter pills
Just to feel alright because we’ll be alright

We got a problem because we can’t grow up
We got a problem because we get messed up

Please let me get one more hit
Made of radio waves with the milkshake mix so thick so thick so sweet
Put powder on the put
Put the powder on the beat
The girlfriend's gone for a weekend retreat
I got three whole days to get back on my feet
Stop taking these crazy little yellow letter pills
Just to feel alright because we’ll be alright

We got a little problem and we can’t grow up
We’re spending all our time getting so messed up

We got a problem because we can’t grow up
We got a problem because we get messed up

This is a rock n roll song about perceptive perceptions
Just a regular song about kinetic connections

Put your right hand up and swing your left around
Move your hips to the side and let your hair fall downYou might also likeEmbed
