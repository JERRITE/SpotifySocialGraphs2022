TranslationsDeutschDansk100 Ways Lyrics[Verse 1]
You turn over the hourglass, the sand is falling down
Oh, it's too fast for you, oh, you
Don't waste your love, just let it last
'Cause once it's gone it's never coming back
It's true

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you love me the same?
Tell me what makes you stay
[Chorus]
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a lover
Hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a—
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
I won't wait a minute longer
Hundred ways to leave—
But I'm the only one that you need

[Verse 2]
It's the final curtain call, but if you're ready
I will give my all for you, for you
Let them say it how they want
If I can love you good, it's no one's fault
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you love me the same?
Tell me what makes you stay

[Chorus]
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a lover
Hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a—
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
I won't wait a minute longer
Hundred ways to leave—
But I'm the only one that you need

I'm the only one that you need
I'm the only one that you need

[Chorus]
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a lover
Hundred ways to leave a lover
Leave a lover, leave a—
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover
I won't wait a minute longer
Hundred ways to leave—
But I'm the only one that you need

[Outro]
I'm the only one that you need
I'm the only one that you need15Embed
