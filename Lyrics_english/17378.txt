Grew Up On Drugs Lyrics[Intro]
(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

[Chorus]
I grew up on drugs, grew up on drugs, grew up on (what I grew up on)
What I’ll do for some love, do for some love, do for some love (do it for)
All they need is a hug to [?], they don’t wanna help you unless it’s beneficial
Let the rain pour down, is it God tears? You ain’t gotta come forward, just be willin'

[Verse]
Accepting my path, daddy alive, but he never reached out to convert
[?],them different drugs got me attached to a feeling, that ain’t God work
I’m in a mission, Kim impossible, why would I stop now? [?]
But then my friend died, overdose, plenty times, I was in the back feeling nauseous off of particles
This the same tournament, that my grandad played, now we morning him
I mean this shit torturing, It’s a mad thing so we just [?]
My back against the wall and I feel it, I had to take a hit just feel normal again
I couldn’t even lift a weight for my physics
She took my strength, hoping that I can be reborn again
[Chorus]
I grew up on drugs, grew up on drugs, grew up on, uh (what I grew up on)
What I’ll do for some love, do for some love, do for some, uh (what I do for some)
All they need is a hug to [?], they don’t wanna help you unless it’s beneficial
Let the rain pour down, is it God tears? You ain’t gotta come forward, just be willin'You might also likeEmbed
