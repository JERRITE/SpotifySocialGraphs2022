The Bully Freestyle Season 2 Intro Lyrics[Intro]
Kill the Coyote
One-Zone did the one, bro

[Verse 1]
The bully back, still yelling fuck the authorities (Fuck 'em)
Fuck Mr. Porky the Pig that morbidly murder minorities
Hate it or love it, the blade in my clutches
I paid for the hit, shit, I might raise the budget
Just aim it and buss it (Brr)
These niggas like paraplegics, don't stand up for nothin'
They came in on crutches, uh (Ha)
Throwed off, need to see a physician
Be movin' and shakin', I need an assistant
My white bitch a trip, she don't season her chicken (Uh)
Top ten in the A, how they leavin' out Benton? (Brr)
I aim at your hеad and that K get to spittin'
I carry the nine, shit that's basic addition
I bodiеd the beat, I just paid the mortician, uh
I pop up on niggas like Beetlejuice (Beetle)
Brand new scope on the Glizzy, ho, peek-a-boo (peek-a-boo)
Brand new Bully Freestyle, nigga, Season 2 (Ooh)
I'm sick and I don't think it's treatable (Uh-huh)
Hasta luego, when I drop it's fuego
Went back independent and dropped out the label
These nigga's so pussy they probably do kegels
The black Danny Trejo, machetes and Dracos (Brr)
When you gettin' new guap, you always get new opps
Wa-ba-ba-loo-bop, you not the new 2Pac (Nah)
These niggas all talk, you gon' get your whole crew shot (Facts)
Shoot up your house, let the choppa sing doo-wop (Brr)
I crawled out of hell and I barely escaped (Uh-huh)
Brushed off the dirt then I buried the snakes (Ooh)
Count money, get top while I'm wearing my shades
The bully's back, you should be very afraid, uh (Ha)
[Chorus]
To drop your heart, baby
Just wait to drop your heart
Just wait to drop your heart, baby
Just wait to drop your heart
Just wait to drop your heart, baby
Just wait to drop your heart
Just wait— Just wait— Just wait— wait— wait—
Just wait to drop your heart, yeah

[Verse 2]
Give a fuck if you flooded your neck piece (Uh)
You gon' respect me, I'm 'bout to resurrect F.V. 
Saw through your skin where your bone and your flesh meet (hrrr)
Fuck subliminals, callin' out names, I'm dissin' you niggas directly
I'm itchin' to murder a rapper, I'm edgy, I dare you to egg me (Uh)
Bitch, I'm going dumb, the bully a don (Ooh)
My daddy Megatron, the son of a gun
I pull up, pop out, I'm in front of your lawn
I whoop that nigga's ass in front of his mom (Ha)
The drip is crazy, bitch, you know I'm a stud (Ooh)
The bully, baby, I am so nonchalant
I fuck centerfolds, she gon' throw up her lunch (Blah)
And suck my dick before she roll up the blunt (Ha)
Bitch, welcome to hell, I slung a few shells
Step over the corpse, I can't stomach the smell
I took a few L's but I'ma prevail
Ain't saving these hoes like the son of Jor-El (Ha)
Psh, I turn your lights out
Might go back to smokin' White Owls (Ooh)
Fuck it, I go to the White House
I stick my dick in the President's wife mouth (Uh)
Bitch, it's the god, go tell 'em I've risen
I pop out your brain, now we sharin' his tvision (Brr)
I come for your family, ain't sparin' the children
The bully back, baby, it's Jarren the villain (Yeah)
I crawled out of hell and I barely escaped (Ooh)
I severed the snakes and I buried the fakes (Ooh)
You pussies serrated, blade tear up your face (Yeah)
It's Season 2, niggas, be very afraid (Ha)

To drop your heart, baby
Just wait to drop your heart
Just wait to drop your heart, baby
Just wait to drop your heart (One-Zone did the one, bro)Embed
