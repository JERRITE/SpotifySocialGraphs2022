Whatever lyrics [lyrics for "whatever"]

[Intro]
That was by far the worst week
That I've ever had in my life
I don't know if I should get up
And I have no plan what I do
Because somehow everything is shit
I've never been to the floor before
Because I know my whole money is gone
And my wife cheated me on
Ahh, whatever
[Hook]
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and cry '
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and cry '

[Part 1]
In the mirror, man, I don't need anything except you
We both pack it, I have you, you have me
And has one of us biscues once
It was certainly because of money or some chick
Now I'm free, free and get up again
I am alone and cry ', "it goes out again"
Spring in the Nikes, Fly, and go like building
In slow motion to the club, it took forever
But it is Saturday night, I'm slowly awake
And pay the first round with a handshake - fits
What's up? Cro, look, that's my world
My hobbies are, uh, push or put legs
Or every now and then a bit lazy on a couch
Sometimes alone and sometimes with women
But today I'm in the club, no, I'm not coming home
Because we celebrate through the night until the sun shines again, yeah
You might so like [Hook]
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and cry '
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and cry '

[Part 2]
I wake up, look out, no plan where I am
The whole house full of women, ey who are sleeping
My pants are torn and the car is gone
Go into the kitchen, first make me a coffee with Jim
Set me, WhatsApp, "What's up, I'm here
And live, but go to you soon "
Okay, and if anyone already knows
What's going on this evening, please, please let me know
Because I'm somehow in the mode, so I don't want to go home
I easily solve problems with a cheap wine
Give me a sip, still a sip, still a sip, still a sip
Still a sip-jap, I'm daba-daba-dai
So give, give, give, give, give me a Becks
And I tipp ', Kipp', Kipp ', Kipp', Kipp 'on ex
Your gear, a few kids with clique on the cap
I grabbed the whiskey and are now pissing off (hey!)
[Hook]
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and cry '
Bye, I feel so free
I do not want to go home anymore
Because I don't give away what's coming tomorrow
I lift my glass and scream
