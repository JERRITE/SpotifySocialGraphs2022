See Me Sweat LyricsTRAPPERMAN DALE:

Trap
Let the BandPlay
Trap

CHORUS
She won’t see me sweat, rubber bands them racks
Nine out of ten, I’ma get it back (Facts)
Yeen even gotta ask, I’ma do the dash
Nigga sit back (Trap)
Throw the bows in the back, when I bust a left I’ma get it back
I’m always grinding up a sack, I pay my lawyer Ten just to handle wax, nigga
Bust it down, I’ma tax niggas
Yeen real, yeen that nigga
I was in the field, had to sack niggas
Rapid fire got the mac slippin
I’ve been burning tires , got the pack with me
(Skrttt)
Getting money hoes act different, even got my main bitch back tripping
(Bitch)
STARLITO
VERSE 1
But my lil freak, keep it too real said her friend want me
Said I’m getting money for real but I won’t spend on her
Got so many people that depend on me, I’m the big homie
Fell in this bitch with bout Ten on me
Woke up throwed, yeah I’ve been on it
Bury me with a flip phone, just make sure you put some minutes on it (Grind Hard)
Told them call me when they finish, met my play at popeyes with the spinach
Margiela tennis, got ‘em out of Lenx
Bought my bitch a bag, keep my pistol in it
Valid gun license, name on the rental
I’ma leave the game same way I entered (Lito)
Don’t give a fuck about no fame, i just paid my lawyer 20
I’m in the trenches with it, pouring Remy
Shooting hunnid, hunnid
Got my 40 with me, I was getting off raw shorting niggas (Grind Hard)
You the type to go report a nigga
Interrogation,probably pointing at pictures
Take the stand, go to court on niggas
I’ma fuck ya bitch, and record it  nigga (There go your evidence)

TRAPPER MAN DALE

I got five on it, nine piece I’ma slide on it
Niggas pointing fingers, wearing wires on us
Got the glizzy here, I got eyes on ya
Thirty Thirty call it bulldozer
Bought the fridgidaire  just to cool overs
Hoes lost, I told her move over
Had to hide sacks under dude’s sofa
Eyes shut, and im loaded (Nah)
Yeen never seen a rollie
Yeen have to vacuum seal it ‘cause it’s potent
Flying south with yo shawty
She just want to let me hit because I’m about it (Bout it)
I ain’t ever owned a wallet
Fast money, fast cash no flodgin’ (flodgin’)
On the first I get it poppin, got my side bitch flying down Collins
Catch up, bet I won’t fuck up my my check cuz
Me, I couldn’t care who next up
OG smelling like pressure
Cutting high young nigga from the neck, up
From the bottom you see how I crawl
I sold me a brick, I hid cash in the wall
Can’t cross none of mine, cause I’m ridin’ for the cause

CHORUS
She won’t see me sweat, rubber bands them racks
Nine out of ten, I’ma get it back (Facts)
