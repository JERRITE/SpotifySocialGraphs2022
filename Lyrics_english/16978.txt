Still Water (Love) Lyrics[Intro]
Walk with me
Take my hand
(Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh)
(Still water)
Still water
(Doo-doo-doo doo-do-do-doo)
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahh)

[Verse 1]
Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know, oh no
[Chorus]
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Ooooh

[Bridge]
Walk with me
Take my hand
Still waters

[Verse 2]
Still water
Walk with me
Take my hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deepYou might also like1Embed
