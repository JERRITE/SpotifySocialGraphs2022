The Lyrics corner [letter of "the corner" "ft. Persian "La Voz" & Eliot el Magico d oz]

[Intro: Persian "the voice"]
Hey, I find myself here in my cell
Looking for my little window
Missing my corner
Where detonacione 'are bass
The scanner and siren 'are the melody
While the claquera is prostituted
The addict rebuilds his cure
The 'handle' pa 'keep their family sell heroine
The 'tennis guinding in the post' with the 'broken' focus'
The dogs' eating the garbage
Where they look a lot 'face, but they are heart are little'
Where the Títerе 'watch the castillito de Armina dreaming of leaving poverty (says)
Here is never over what begins (AEH-OH-AH)
Here I will die; In my corner, but happy
[Chorus: J Alvarez]
People think I'm sleeping
People imagine that I am dying
What 'does not know e' that I am happy
In the same corner, here I will continue

[Saying: j alvarez]
OH-OH-OH, in the same corner
Here I will continue, my black
OH-OH-OH, in the same corner
Here I will continue

[Verse 1: yomo]
I fall, of course, my life has been an impudence
But as I fall, I also stop
I do not repair you, much men 'to luck
Although he knows that e 'expensive, the most expensive e' death
Gracia 'A Dio' 'Toy alive, health, table and hanging
My own story I write, my pain 'singing
Sorry, is in this world full of hypocrisy
The law of the street sigo, not of the police
In a street the 'broken' focus'
The dark night, the hard break (hey, Eliot, how does the choir say?)
Alley, broken spotlights
The dark night, the hard break

People think I'm sleeping
People imagine that I am dying
What 'does not know e' that I am happy
In the same corner, here I will continue

[Verse 2: ñejo]
(Tell me, nola)
If I knew that life e 'like a wheel
When he has 'sue a vece' e 'when he left you'
"What do you have to have if you don't know 'what to do?" Rubén said
And I was a fat train, I thought I deserved it to '
Until I arrived at the hotel and for the moment and 'goodbye'
The 'simple' thing 'a vece' are the 'ma' that they fill
How to feel the sun, how to see the full moon
The old woman cares about 'fuck' to send me kids
If I don't visit her, more 'the old man
And in the grave for more 'that' I cry
As much as the funeral cuts, for more 'that it takes Flore'
I thought the 'drug', the 'whore' and the bayoya
But what I want e 'to turn to the yoya
A cigarrillito, racing the 'ball'
On the sofa tira'o playing with the lola

[Verse 3: Persian "La Voz"]
Grace 'A dio' Salimo 'and the Egwa opened the way (Ajá)
Now I have fame and money and with humble 'I combine it
I do not forget 'e to'a the' night 'writing with a phillie
And now he is 'in the' Milli, look where Eli Juan Marili (Wow) is
I remember twenty weight 'in the pocket (aha)
Having to buy milk and pampers pa'l my son (yah)
I later suffered so much and seven year 'in prison
The door could open and the blessing came to me (Amen, Pa ')

[Saying: j alvarez]
OH-OH-OH, in the same corner
Here I will continue, my black
OH-OH-OH, in the same corner
Here I will continue
