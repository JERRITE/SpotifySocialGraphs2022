Iâ€™m Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
They just wanna smoke and drank with you
They just wanna take you down and uh
They just always tryna pull up
They ain't never tryna take you out
They just wanna pop champagne with you
They just tryna flex for the gram
They ain't even tryna get to know ya
They ain't ever really gave a damn

[Pre-Hook]
Babygirl, I'm a different kinda nigga
Plus I think your prettier without it
Baby, you don't even need a filter
Got a proposition for ya girl, how bout it?
I should be your next man
I'm better than your ex man
I bet ya mama gon' like me
And ya big bro too
I bet ya daddy gon' like me
And ya homeboys too

[Verse 2]
Imma show you things, you ain't ever seen
Turn ya nightmares into wet dreams
What's yo ring size, girl, pick your wedding ring
Picture us ring side sitting on designer jeans
Shoes blood shot red on the bottom
In my drop top ridding with my bonnie
It's 7 o'clock we on my drop top
Soon as I get you home, we goin' non stop

[Pre-Hook]
Babygirl, I'm a different kinda nigga
Plus I think your prettier without it
Baby, you don't even need a filter
Got a proposition for ya girl, how bout it?
I should be your next man
I'm better than your ex man

[Bridge]
Baby I'll do, what he wouldn't do
Better yet do, what he couldn't do
I'll be him you be her
We'll be bullet proof
If you run out of bullets, I'll shoot for you
If they shoot at my baby, I'll take it for you
I don't care about laws, girl, I'll break them for you
If we ever get caught, girl, I'll take it for us
