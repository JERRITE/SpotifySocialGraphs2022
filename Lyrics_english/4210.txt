Your body snatches me lyrics [lyrics by "Your body snatches me" ft. Trebol clan]

[Chorus: Periquito]
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
[Verse 1: Trebol clan]
When they made you took it out of the park
Your pa'i and your ma'i were guilla
They made you more perfect than a guitar
More curves, and clan trembol without brakes
Tonight I invite you to go out
To be able to try your body
If you zaof, I save myself
And if I light, I look
If you kiss me, I kiss you
If you hit yourself, I guayo
Thus we start and the dance '
Thus we start, listen to this
I take it to the album and do it
I carry it in my car and I will do it
I take it with the gift and vo'a do
Wherever the lame will vo'a do

[Chorus: Don Omar]
Your body kills me, baby
Your body drives me crazy
Your body kills me, baby
Your body drives me crazy
Your body kills me, baby
Your body drives me crazy
Your body kills me, baby

Look at it how it goes
Dancing above the ground
His hips are a trip to heaven
And I love when it takes flight
Look at it how it goes
Dancing above the ground
His hips are a trip to heaven
And I love when it takes flight

[Chorus: Periquito]
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy

[Verse 3: Berto]
Your body, mommy, is the one who snatches me
Your body is the one that drives me crazy
YOUR BODY TO MY HYPNOTIZE MIND
With a look of yours bewitched me
Mamita, tell me that I do now
If I would like to make you my lady
If the air I breathe love
The heart beats me a hundred per hour
[Chorus: Don Omar, Periquito]
Your body kills me, baby
Your body drives me crazy
Your body kills me, baby
Your body drives me crazy

Bandida, your body snatches me
It drives me crazy
Bandida, your body snatches me
It drives me crazy

I take it to the album and do it ...
I carry it in my car and do it ...
I take it with the gift and do it ...
Wherever the lame will vo'a to do ...

Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
Your body, ma'i, snatches me
Your body makes me crazy
