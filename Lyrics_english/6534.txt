Your Love Could Start a War Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I gotta love you
Our name is written in the streets
(Written in concrete)
You are a force of nature
The fire's moving through your feet
(Moving through your feet)

[Chorus]
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Oh, your love
Your love could start a
Your love could start a war
[Verse 2]
The dawn will break before you
Under your thumb I'm on my knees
(You got me on my knees)
You play a game of pressure
You're getting stronger while I sleep
(Stronger while I sleep)
You're burning up the sky you're a constellation
Swear that I could die in this revelation

[Chorus]
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Oh, your love
Your love could start a
Your love could start a war

[Verse 3]
Your battle cry is drowning out the fear
Just take my life I know the end is near
You're riot dancing but I just want to fly
I hear you singing "tomorrow never dies"

I would die for this revelation
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war
Your love could start a war
It's what I'm fighting for
War

[Chorus]
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Oh, your love
(Is what I'm fighting for)
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war

[Outro]
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Oh, your love
Your love could start a war1Embed
