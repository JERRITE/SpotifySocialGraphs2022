TranslationsEspa√±olFinale Lyrics[Intro: Nicholas Petricca]
Woah-oah-oah-oah-oah
Brace yourself, brace yourself
Woah-oah-oah-oah-oah

[Chorus: Nicholas Petricca]
Your last chance, last summer
Your last dance, beat to your own drummer
Go out fighting, go out young
A flash of lightning, eclipse the sun
(Brace yourself) Your last chance
(For this ride with me) Last summer
(Last connection) Your last dance
(Collide with me) Beat to your own drummer
(Arrive at the station) Go out fighting
(You hear the bell) Go out young
(You best be patient) A flash of lightning
(Brace yourself) Eclipse the sun
[Post-Chorus: Nicholas Petricca]
(Brace yourself) Brace yourself (Brace your, brace yourself)
(Brace yourself) Brace yourself
Brace yourself for the grand finale

[Bridge]
Yeah
Last connection
Collide with me (Collide with me)
Yeah
This burning (This burning)

[Chorus: Nicholas Petricca]
Your last chance, last summer
Your last dance, beat to your own drummer
Go out fighting, go out young
A flash of lightning, eclipse the sun

[Outro: Nicholas Petricca]
