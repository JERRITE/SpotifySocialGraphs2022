Bloody Bars - Lyrics drillumination [Text of "Bloody Bars - Drillumination" FT. Charlie Kdm, Hell Raton, Lazza & Low Kidd]

[Intro: charlie kdm]
Raga, but that's Young Miles
Hey, hey
Hey, we are here raga ', upset, blind
We are in two hundred, buy yourself
Come on, boh, boh with this skit stuff
Ajo Ignazè, let me do this verse, from '

[Verse 1: charlie kdm]
Charlie has the cure (Rrah): smoke Morocco, rum from Cuba
Mafia and Yakuza, in Jacuzzi with your puta
Who is afraid? (I certainly not), I certainly not, I'm on the moon
Machete Moonstar, new cartel, does not bugger you
Children of a she -wolf, born with the suit
Beautiful for biggie, beautiful for 2pac (GG for 2pac)
If you bring respect, I respect you (respect)
If you do the fool, I'm affixed to the river, your body I wait for it
Charlie Más Loco, I'm out of Kyoto's pacts
You are half dead, you are spread over coconut fruits
To make you a blow, I saw you being a whore (slut)
I was the most serious, I stay the most romen, I sell everything, master
[Schof 2: Young Miles]
Charlie is the New Rick-Rick Ross, 'Stica sluts only Deep Throat
Bloody B-Big Big Drop, you still ask me where I'm
I'm in San Teodoro, enough with the photos (raised)
You are a treasure, Fufu and Farlocco
You have to press me a little, you have to press me a little

[Pre-Cirnelello: Young Miles]
I don't keep stress, I'm with Machete Gang
You with trend classiconi, pity is the Bloody 3
Too bad that, no, your boyfriend doesn't like it
Maybe because his lady would only like me
Because he only thinks about cash

[Refrain: Tha Supreme]
Okay, think of cash, no bluff, no stress if I'm with mine, yah
I press this crowd, it is Benza for 'this pussy is a girl
Move the ass, I swear, as if twerkasse for a lifetime
It makes me: "Sorry, Drippo with 'sti beat"

[Verse 3: tha supreme]
Lando in Olbia, I call "socia" who I would call "Troy" (Troy)
I'm with my brothers, you can call it "gang shit", "blessing" or "history" (history)
Don't foment, remain bad, friar ', since I split (cross -section)
You have to calm down, always the same and taken badly since I remember
Drillo, drippo, gringo, bingo, if I do it
Sharp, like Trick Shot Giro, then I shoot you
Try not to take a shot of 'this fuse
It is there, yes, but I know it is making you crazy
I grindo a kilo, scream, what do you want?
'Sta bitches knows what he wants
A-B-C-D, Sex, Drugs, Money
I fall into abysses that also forget my name
I bore me, what do you want? 'Ste Stories
But that outside, but what mistakes, you are macaroni
It makes me laugh that you call yourself "enlightened"
Just because you have lighting at home
I have lighting
I try to explain to you with only one song
Whether you have the SWAG or you don't have it
Chia-we are this piece "dried"

I was fearless, without a lira, without pretensions
Without her (she), how well I am, eh, eh
How many bullshit, yes, g, I laugh, now I don't think about it,
A record a month too 'I'm month, eh, eh
I don't pay any expense, above a Mercedes without 'ste fools, Fra'
Tell me who you are, yes, tell me who you are, eh, eh
Yes, I only think about Bloody 3, you, no, are not with mine
No, not even with me, I only think of my business
And of all the gang, you always speak badly
Yes, but we know who you are, yes, we know who you are

[Pre-Cirnelello: Young Miles]
I don't keep stress, I'm with Machete Gang
You with trend classiconi, pity is the Bloody 3
Too bad that, no, you don't like your boyfriend
Maybe because his lady would only like me
Because he only thinks about cash

[Refrain: Tha Supreme]
Okay, think of cash, no bluff, no stress if I'm with mine, yah
I press this crowd, it is Benza for 'this pussy is a girl
Move the ass, I swear, as if twerkasse for a lifetime
It makes me: "Sorry, Drippo with 'sti beat"

[Schof 5: Hell Raton & Lazza]
Otra Noche Como Ayer, Mezclo Leche with Nestlè
Paparazzi, Dame a break, Todos Ven La Gang-Gang Ready
Y Juego Muchos Videogames, Directo en twitch tu empuja play
Nintendo Switch, Xbox Y Play, Mato Todos Once Again
She eS mala, but the chupa, pobre on novio, no culpa
Yes to mí me gusta, baddit bruja, nada me asusta but a puta
Puede Dañar Todo, Puede, Puede Dañar Todo
Digo Gracias at Amor Porque Por on Culpa Lloro
Mira dear me, resists Las Balas, resists Las Lenguas
Que hablan y hablan, periodistas me llaman
Contenste en la Cama, Contestte en la Playa, Machete Empire
On the ass es Papaya, Lo Cubro de Oro (Yeah), Como Los Mayas (hey)
[Verse 6: Lazza]
New cd, new my feat '
New Loubou-U '
Cuban the link, I'll wait for you here
For voodoo -oo
She leaves the house that still has a breath
As if it does aerobics
But it was in my bed, I without respect
I have my feet in my chest, Leonida
You have neither Money nor Pussy
Ask: "What is Dior?", It's not just Dior
It is Dior X Stüssy
Top floor, watussi
If a Fra 'calls me, but the line falls
Because it does not take it, I call him back
You are an infamous from when they were in the belly
Friar ', like a solitary worm, uoh

[Verse 7: Low Kidd]
Mob, if you do 6ix9ine, are Lee Harvey
Amusement park, you are targets (pizza)
Pieces on the chest cover the cuts
If you talk about the Mob, Bro, sure wrong
Here never, no, no, broi, I swear
That is not mine
Fuck, you number one?
I'm never sure (never)
Free Tony, Free Tony, Free Tony, Free Tony
Free Tony, Free Tony, Free Tony
Fuck the glasses, I would already like you out
Ignorant guards send me out
And even if you have a patek, bro, we all die
Both from innocent and from Farabutti
Hi, I'm the one with a little ugly beat
The 3 came out, but I see you destroyed, Holla

[Bridge: Young Miles]
Live next to the stories, you are just a storyteller
5-0-1-9, here, friar ', only victories
Live next to the stories, always your head beyond
If BV3 is out, fuck do you do not listen to it? (Bloody Vinyl)

[Outro: Charlie Kdm & Young Miles]
Mind, my Spoti profile ', but isn't it that now I'm about to become a rapper, friar'?
Hahahah
Now every month a drop, charlie10embed
