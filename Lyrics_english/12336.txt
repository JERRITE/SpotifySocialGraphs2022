Fuck It Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Kamaiyah]
Don't need no introduction I'm a fool
School girl but I didn't make it out of school
Mama told me "I done raised a fool"
But I didn't listen, I was optimistic
And now I'm in the studio, see no competition
They sneakin' and dissin' don't care bout them bitches
I had a dream of Beamers on 6's
Give me 3 months and I swear I'ma get it, oh
Big money get in quick, you know we ball out
We do all the shit that you just talk bout
I left my ex-nigga in the dog house
Two phones, I ignore his calls now
Cause I'm up now
And they do not want to see this girl shinin'
Give a fuck now
You just say that you bout it, you lyin'
[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Fuck it up, west side niggas know we fuck it up
Dubs up, how you know we thug it up
If you don't get no ends, you cannot fuck with us
You cannot fuck with us
You know we drunk as fuck
Drugs in the club cause the club with us
The G's all think, you know I'm number one
If you don't get no cheese, you get no love from us
You get no love from us, you get no love from us

[Verse 2: YG]
Fuck it up girl, go on fuck it up
This Petron, I got the devil in my cup
Fuck it up girl, go on fuck it up
Rich nigga pay whatever for a nut
Go west (go, go, go)
Gotta keep the nine on me, she say these niggas brazy
Niggas say they made me, well make another me
In that Benzo
Maybach, a nigga bought a limbo
Thick, thick ass got dimples
Fuck then nut, shit simple
That's what I'm here for
I got sharkses out here I'm a fool with it
This movie don't need extras I'm too with it
Chessboard you would think I move with it
I'm a builder and you know Bob keep a tool with him

Fuck it up, west side niggas know we fuck it up
Dubs up, how you know we thug it up
If you don't get no ends, you cannot fuck with us
You cannot fuck with us
You know we drunk as fuck
Drugs in the club cause the club with us
The G's all think, you know I'm number one
If you don't get no cheese, you get no love from us
You get no love from us, you get no love from us14Embed
