Real Good Feeling Lyrics[Intro]
Na, na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na

[Verse 1]
I woke up feeling like this gon' be my day
I've got that poppin' fire every step I take
Living that wild life, not stopping now, no way
Just seeing green lights, won't ever touch the brakes

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now
[Chorus]
Got a real good feeling, got a real good feeling
Like there is lighting deep in my bones
Got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
I'm going higher than I've ever known
Got a real good feeling

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na

[Verse 2]
This place is jumping off, hot as it can get
No, we won't ever stop dancing on the edge
We like it dangerous, we like to see you sweat
Turn up a another notch, you ain't seen nothing yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now (Ooh)
Right now, right now

Got a real good feeling, got a real good feeling
Like there is lighting deep in my bones
Got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
I'm going higher than I've ever known
Yeah, I got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
Like there is lightning deep in my bones
Got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
I'm going higher than I've ever known
Got a real good feeling

[Bridge]
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now (Let me tell you something)
Right now, right now

[Chorus]
Oh, I got a real good feeling, got a real good feeling
Like there is lightning deep in my bones
Yeah, I got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
I'm going higher than I've ever known
Yeah, I got a real good feeling, got a real good feeling
Like there is lightning deep in my bones
Yeah, I got a real good feeling, I won't hit no ceiling
I'm going higher than I've ever known
I got a real good feelingEmbed
