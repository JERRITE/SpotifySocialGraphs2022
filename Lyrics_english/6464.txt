Born Bold LyricsAll of these thresholds
Can't hold me down
Pushed thru the crossroads
And I hit the ground
No different picture
Just a bigger frame
To Find my place
I Don't need to change
No I won't change

And I chase this river to the Ends of the earth but it won't
Rattle my bones
It won't rattle my bones
While my soul is free
On this wide open road
And I'm bringing it home
Bringing it home
I was born bold
I was born free
I'm taking the reigns
When the world gets cold
I can't be bought or sold you see
I was born bold
Moving these mountains that are in my view
No room for doubting
Gotta see it thru
I’m on the road like a renegade
I’ll be the storm and I’ll ride the wide
Ohh Oohh Gonna ride this wave

And I chase this river to the Ends of the earth but it won't
Rattle my bones
It won't rattle my bones
While my soul is free
On this wide open road
And I'm bringing it home
Bringing it home
I was born bold
I was born free
I'm taking the reigns
When the world gets cold
I can't be bought or sold you see
I was born bold

Gonna set the fire
And free my soul
Gonna set the fire

And I chase this river to the Ends of the earth but it won't
Rattle my bones
It won't rattle my bones
While my soul is free
On this wide open road
And I'm bringing it home
Bringing it home
I was born bold
I was born free
I'm taking the reigns
When the world gets cold
I can't be bought or sold you see
I was born boldYou might also likeEmbed
