Four Walls Lyrics[Verse 1]
You walked in said I've got some news:
I didn't say all I wanted to
You know I told you that I wasn't scared, well I lied
You told me babe, I only think of you
And I said all I got is a bunch of sad stories
And I told them all before the night was through
And we cried (oh) but we're here now
And I'm trying hard to make you love me
But I don't wanna try too hard
And I'm trying hard to take it lightly
But we're here now
[Chorus]
Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
And those four walls now are home
And those four walls now are the only place that I can feel
And those four walls now are home

[Verse 2]
I wanna make you feel how I feel when I'm listening to love songs
I wanna take you to the peak of everything that you are
You're everything I need tonight
And I'm trying hard to make you want me
But I don't wanna try too hard
I was thinking you got what you came for
But you're here now

[Chorus]
Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
And those four walls now are home
And those four walls now are the only place that I can feel
And those four walls now are home

[Bridge]
Falling at the hand of a perfect man
Falling at the hand of a perfect man

[Chorus - Variation]
Those four walls now are the only place that I can breathe out
And those four walls now are home
And those three words now are the only thing that came to save me
And those three words now are home
