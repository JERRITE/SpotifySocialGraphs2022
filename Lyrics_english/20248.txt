I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you

[Chorus]
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
[Verse 1]
I think I found the antidote
I think I found another road
I think I found some fucking hope, nope (Nope)
I think I'm tryna find a way
To rid of all these darker days
But my mind's trapped inside a maze
So I'll run so far from these shadows (From the shadows)
Makeshift, but my heart's still fragile (Heart's still fragile)
I'd drown, but the water's too shallow (Water's too shallow)
My head's still caught in the gallows (Caught in the gallows)
Your kiss is my remedy (Remedy)
I fall to the ground so desperately (Desperately)
Baby, I know that you're mad at me (Mad at me)
Filling all the voids like cavities (Cavities)

[Chorus]
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
You might also like[Verse 2]
I guess this feeling lasts forever (Lasts forever)
I guess we'll never be together (Be together)
You're colder than I can remember
But the ice is melting quickly
I'm still wishing that you'd miss me (That you'd miss me)
But you're gone and I never could replace you (Never could replace you)
Mistraced new face, but it ain't you (But it ain't you)
Rebuilding the forts that I made you (Forts that I made you)
No love, but my heart's tryna breakthrough
My chest 'cause it's caving in (Caving in)
I dwell in a cell in a realm of sin (Realm of sin)
Six shots to the face of rum and gin (Rum and gin)
I'm dead in the head so I guess you win (Guess you win)

[Chorus]
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you, without you, without you

[Outro]
I think I'd be better off alone (Better off alone, better off alone)
I don't mind when I sleep all alone (I sleep all alone)
Without you, without you15Embed
