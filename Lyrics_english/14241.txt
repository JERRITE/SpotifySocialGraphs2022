No Oneâ€™s Better Sake LyricsOne thought has me turning back
A dozen point the other way
We act upon desire
To each a hand for hire
And patience isn't worth the wait

You've got knives in your eyes
You would be happy not to change your mind
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke instead of putting out the fire
And if we work it out
Chances abound
We'd be standing our ground
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

Hum... What are we waiting for?

How faint might that light become
In focus but at miles away?
Although my position
Just gives you ammunition
Be certain that I know my place
So is this how it ends?
Oh with a whimper in the place of a bang
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke instead of putting out the fire
You might also likeAnd if we work it out
Chances abound
We'd be standing our ground
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye

We would be friends
If we tried again
I'll take second place
Just to end the race
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye1Embed
