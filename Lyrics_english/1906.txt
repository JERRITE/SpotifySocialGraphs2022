More Than Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Mm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You got a way with words
You take away the hurt
And it's a blessing and a curse to feel it all
You got a way with me
You put me in my place when I'm petty
Give me what I want when I'm ready
You always hold it down
[Pre-Chorus]
Anybody else, I'd be gone by now
Doesn't really matter, all that really matters
Second I'm with you, all my love pour out
Serve it on a platter, all that really matters

[Chorus]
All that really matters is you keep showing up
Promise I'll remind you that you are more than enough

[Verse 2]
I get lost inside all the stars in your eyes
It's a galaxy (Galaxy)
You control the tide like the moon in the sky
You're the gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
Anybody else would be gone by now
Doesn't really matter, all that really matter
Second I'm with you, all my love pour out
Serve it on a platter, all that really matters

[Chorus]
All that really matters is you keep showing up
Promise I'll remind you that you are more than enough

Ah, mm, ah
More than enough, more than enough
More than enough, mm
More than enough, more than enough
More than enough
More than enough, more than enough (Ahh)
More than enough
More than enough, more than enough (Ahh)
