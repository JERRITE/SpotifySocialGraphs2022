Losing Blood Lyrics[Intro]
(Gari, chop that shit up)
Are we recording? Uh-huh, bet
(Kaydrippedinsauce, Kay dripped in sauce)
Yeah
Remember I was downâ€”
Yeah

[Chorus]
Remember I was down, but now I'm up, this shit been feeling different
'Cause I stopped counting on their love, I'm only counting digits
You ain't like me broke, once I got mine, I couldn't mind my business
Without a pussy, tryna find a way to claim they did it (Okay)
Did it on my own, that's me, myself, and I, baby, I can't lie
I'm in my zone, bitch I been in my prime, fire in my eyes
Only depend upon myself to make it through the mud (Whoo)
I had my back stabbed too damn much to keep on losing blood
[Verse 1]
I'm fucking a bad bitch now
Do that make me a savage now?
I done went from an average house
To rocking some shit on my wrist that stick out like a cyst
I'm back in town
Lemme take back my crown
Thotties want me to take them out
But I'm here for the night, baby girl, I ain't taking no risks, yeah
Swear I ain't taking no shit
Not like did way back when, yeah (Oh no)
Changed up how I live
More than spare change in my wallet, yeah
Shorty wanna have my kid, yeah
But I just bust on her lip, yeah (Ooh)
I just bust out the Bentley
She wanna hop in my whip

[Pre-Chorus]
Overlooked so much, it made me hard
Fuck all the praise from my past foes
Overlooked so much, it left a scar
And they wonder why I'm such an asshole

[Chorus]
Remember I was down, but now I'm up, this shit been feeling different
'Cause I stopped counting on their love, I'm only counting digits
You ain't like me broke, once I got mine, I couldn't mind my business
Without a pussy, tryna find a way to claim they did it (Okay)
Did it on my own, that's me, myself, and I, baby, I can't lie
I'm in my zone, bitch I been in my prime, fire in my eyes
Only depend upon myself to make it through the mud (Whoo)
I had my back stabbed too damn much to keep on losing blood (Ayy)

I ain't looking ba-a-ack
I can't give a fuck 'bout what you said when this dot on my head
It's a tra-a-ap
'Cause they won't pay you respect 'til they pay their respects for you (Whoo)
So I'ma proceed with my head down
If they kill off my brother, they dead now
If you not on my team then fuck do you mean?
You never checked in, that don't check out
Never fitting in, I was left out
Now I'm in the Benz like "How you been?", I got bread now

[Pre-Chorus]
Overlooked so much it made me hard
Fuck all the praise from my past foes
Overlooked so much it left a scar
And they wonder why I'm such an asshole

[Chorus]
Remember I was down, but now I'm up, this shit been feeling different
'Cause I stopped counting on their love, I'm only counting digits
You ain't like me broke, once I got mine, I couldn't mind my business
Without a pussy, tryna find a way to claim they did it (Okay)
Did it on my own, that's me, myself, and I, baby, I can't lie
I'm in my zone, bitch I been in my prime, fire in my eyes
Only depend upon myself to make it through the mud (Whoo)
I had my back stabbed too damn much to keep on losing blood
[Outro]
They gon' stab my back
Got me in attack mode
If you coming for the gang
I'ma send you back home
Oh, oh, I don't give a fuck
If you really tryna mess with the kit, then good luckEmbed
