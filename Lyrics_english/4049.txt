Lyrics travelers ["Travelers"]

[Chorus: Elysanij]
The night lends itself
For your mouth to take me to 1970
Take me to the past and provide a strawberry whip
Under a full moon
Feel your star, Woh-Oh
That our little bed
Be within an Alfa Romeo of 1950
Kiss me until little a little night disappears
Under a full moon
Feel your star, Woh-Oh
[Verse 1: Dalmatian]
Hearme, Elysanij
Tell me if tonight 'you are ready for me
That I am read for you
Tick ​​'in the navel and see you laugh
Like the Pillsbury ads doll
Ready pa 'be your teddy bear
Or become your pillow and feel
Your breathing, your wet lips close to me, mommy
You warm warm to me
Dreaming of me while at the same time you sleep in me
Ask that mouth, that I give you what I want '
To'a the night to give you, mommy, to give you
Like the genius of the Aladdin lamp (your wishes I will fulfill)
Ask that mouth, that I give you what I want '
To'a the night to give you, mommy, to give you

[Chorus: Elysanij]
The night lends itself
For your mouth to take me to 1970
Take me to the past and provide a strawberry whip
Under a full moon
Feel your star, Woh-Oh (Baby)

[Verse 2: Elysanij]
Tell me if you are 'read or not because I am
Let's go travel the world, Baby
I want with you, you want 'with me
VAMONO 'Solito' to a hidden place
The night lends itself and the moon and witness (Yeah)
You only indicate (Yeah) that I follow you
