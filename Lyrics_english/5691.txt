Feel It Again LyricsI used to dance at the devil's feet
He made me feel like I never want to go home

Oh
I thought he'd save my soul
Sipping at the bottom of an empty glass
No I don't remember going to hell and back
But I know

Oh
I was out of control
I don't wanna do this anymore
Gotta pick myself up off the floor
Let it rain
Let it pour
Let the tears come down like a waterfall
I'd rather live with the pain than die
Feeling nothing at all

Throw another penny in the wishing well
One for the road and I tell myself to go home

Oh
It's better than being alone
Heart as cold as a block of ice
Playing with fire and I don't think twice
But I know

Oh
I'm sippin' away my soul
I don't wanna do this anymore
Gotta pick myself up off the floor

Let it rain
Let it pour
Let the tears come down like a waterfall
I'd rather live with the pain than die
Feeling nothing at all
So come on
Let it in
'Cause you can't feel love till you jump right in
So whenever it hits me I'm ready to feel it again

Let it rain
Let it pour
Let the tears come down like a waterfall
I'd rather live with the pain than die
Feeling nothing at all
So come on
Let it in
'Cause you can't feel love till you jump right in
So whenever it hits me I'm ready to feel it again
So whenever it hits me I'm ready to feel it again
So whenever it hits me I'm ready to feel it againEmbed
