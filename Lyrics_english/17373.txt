Game Face Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh

[Chorus: Booka600]
Von died, we kept that game face, he hate when niggas cry (Gang, gang, gang)
In this world, you either real or fake, I hate when niggas lie
Everybody gotta meet their fate, I hate when it's the guys
I'm just prayin' Cdai beat his case, with murder on my mind (That's a fact)
If you cross us once up in the shit, you separate the ties
I don't need no fuckin' benefits, I'm fortune in they eyes (You hear me?)
You can't walk up in my shit, unfortunately, it's a nine (You can't, nigga)
If we ride around whеre I live, I'll show you how Stevе died
[Verse: Tee Grizzley]
If we riding 'round my hood, I'll show you a trap where you can make fifty a day (Fifty a day)
Can't talk 'bout our business around these niggas, bro, niggas gon' give us away (Keep it low, bro)
If I ain't showed no love, I'd be up another M, I gave a million away (A million, nigga)
If I want you out and give him a K, no talkin', young dog sealin' your fate (Brr, brr)
Came from nothin', we way up there now, nigga, you hear me? We legends in this
Bro up a million, really can shit on you niggas, just ain't on the 'net with this shit
Ignorin' his calls and givin' me neck, I'm like, "Damn, that nigga gon' snap on this bitch" (She foolish)
You and your guys 'bout to step in the club (What?), me and my guys 'bout to step on some bricks (Let's get it)
I was a shorty (Shorty)
Shittin' on niggas that's forty (Forty)
They gon' take what? I ain't worried (From who?)
We up four niggas and forties (Bah)
Hellcats, Trackhawks, on Forgis (Skrrt)
Bad hoes come 'round, have orgies (Let's get it)
I ain't get shit for bein' loyal (I didn't)
Real niggas don't get rewarded

[Chorus: Booka600]
Von died, we kept that game face, he hate when niggas cry
In this world, you either real or fake, I hate when niggas lie
Everybody gotta meet their fate, I hate when it's the guys
I'm just prayin' Cdai beat his case, with murder on my mind
If you cross us once up in the shit, you separate the ties
I don't need no fuckin' benefits, I'm fortune in they eyes
You can't walk up in my shit, unfortunately, it's a nine
If we ride around where I live, I'll show you how Steve died
