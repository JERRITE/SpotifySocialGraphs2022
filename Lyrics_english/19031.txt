Con air lyrics [Part I: Celo]
Spread on the street for new Frees from Nike
60 385, projectile on the MIC
Yes, you are wild, I have now reached my goal
This rap freps and tattered, click over
Do no psis, you know that is business life
MWT, a tape and your miscins cry you
I enjoy the hype, we have teared the scene teared
A2Zlack, we are ready for war
Jamshaft Bielo via back yard
You see Celo with Ebonys in the videos
As usual crips at the zoo, drive the stripes
Observation, Ben-Gurion-Ring, Heisenrath
Oh, be quiet, feels, day girl, clock Earl, Thug Life
Undercover Molotov, Canton of Bern, Switzerland
HJ end time, generation market time, Aslan the line
Block platinum since day 1
[Hook]
Celo:
Celo, Kamikaze combat squadrons
Because I fly into the bank like Mohammed Atta
Aslan:
This is Frankfurt, young come here
The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air
Abdi:
Abdi with flex in the cous and crack in the mouth
I steer the Cessna in the middle of the exhibition tower
Aslan:
This is Frankfurt, young come here
The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air

[Part II: Aslan]
People ask me why I was gone for five years
And they ask me why I broke the law
I tell you why: because my life here dirt
Because a plan for my life in shine was perfect
Aisocial anarchy, punch hammerhart
Yesterday behind bars, today in front of the camera
Deportation, my autograph is worth gold
But a signature makes Lufthansa con air!
Turk from the lower class, hold the face
There is no one that interrupts me, this is ghetto lessons
Aslan, Hooligan, Frankfurt Eintracht
Turkish command, fuck your force
You against me is like dirt against boss
It gets expensive if I rap, because I rap for cash
Radical Taliban, the Canibale Aslan
I say it in the face: Fuck your mother, what LAN?
You might so like [Hook]
Celo:
Celo, Kamikaze combat squadrons
Because I fly into the bank like Mohammed Atta
Aslan:
This is Frankfurt, young come here
The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air
Abdi:
Abdi with flex in the cous and crack in the mouth
I steer the Cessna in the middle of the exhibition tower
Aslan:
This is Frankfurt, young come here
The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air

[Part III: Abdi]
I put on the boss socks and the New Balance shoes
Meet me with 100 grams of coke in the subway
And then I climb to German limousines
I satisfy people for 5 1/2 mille
UF97, also in League 2, is always 1 Frankfurt am Main
Eintracht is my club, black and white like snow
As in Maritim schizophrenic on 5 things Jay
Schweppes Ginger Ale Kipp 'I'm behind Daniel's Jack
Of the 5 grams of flex are still 1.6
Bulls under the bed I definitely have to go here
Directly taxi 23 three times the 0 1, checked
Blurred and jacked is running in my city
A black benz have already stunned here
Dragon Ball Z, between space and time at dende
Undercover Molotova Beat, Psst, Ende series
[Hook]

The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air
Abdi:

I steer the Cessna in the middle of the exhibition tower
Aslan:
This is Frankfurt, young come here
The Boeing 747 is now becoming con air
