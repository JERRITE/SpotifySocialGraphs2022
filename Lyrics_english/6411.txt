TranslationsPortuguÃªsDo It All the Time Lyrics[Intro]
Ha!

[Verse 1]
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
[Verse 2]
We're taking over the world
A little victimless crime
And when I'm taking your innocence
I'll be corrupting your mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No need to cry
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
(Do it all the time)

[Chorus]
Now we're so young, but we're probably gonna die
It's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
We look so good and we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time

[Post-Chorus]
Ha!

[Verse 3]
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine, I'm making her mine

[Chorus]
Now we're so young, but we're probably gonna die
And it's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
We look so good and we never even try
I don't wanna do it, but I'll do it 'cause I do it all the time
Now we're so young, but we're probably gonna die
It's so fun, we're so good at selling lies
We look so good and we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time40Embed
