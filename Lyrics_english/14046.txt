Nothing’s Ever Gonna Be Good Enough Lyrics[Verse 1: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
I never thought I could feel this way
So much attention and so very little to say
The sun was out and you took me to the beaches
We listened to the peaches and I felt strangled today
Oh, but in a nice way

[Chorus: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
'Cause it's all I've got but will it ever be enough?
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough
'Cause it's all I've got but will it ever ever be enough?
(Will it evеr?)
[Verse 2: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae, Both/Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
I get myself into some sticky situations
Rеlationship consultations, convoluted affectations as well
You picked me up in Karl's Impreza
I dressed to impress you in my denim and leather Coco Chanel
Oh, can you tell?

[Chorus: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
'Cause it's all I've got but will it ever be enough?
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough
'Cause it's all I've got but will it ever ever be enough?

[Post-Chorus: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough
Nothing's ever gonna be good enough

[Bridge: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Breaking down the barriers, everything in tatters
My vice is over tightened and girl you know I’m frightened
I gave you all I got, I ain't ever gonna stop
Will it ever be, ever be enough?

[Outro: Miles Kane & Corinne Bailey Rae]
Nothing’s ever gonna be good enough (Ooh, yeah)
