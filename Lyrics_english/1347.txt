Big Plans Lyrics[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
Work all day, work all night
Might not get no sleep tonight
Baby, can you stay up?
We could talk, we could dance
Don't matter the circumstance
We don't let it change us

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
That's the beautiful thing about us
'Fore all the diamonds and rings, we got trust
Roll with me, get it right, faded on a summer night
Let's see where it takes us
[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais]
Know you're tired, know you're down
Know you wanna leave this town
Baby, give me one year, yeah
Take my hand, take a leap
Girl, you gotta wait and see
Where I take it from here

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson, All]
That's the beautiful thing about you
I know that you'd do the same in my shoes
Never switch, never stop, I could see us at the top
Girl, why don't we go there?

I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby (Oh)
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Bridge: Jonah Marais, Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey, Corbyn Besson]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Take a chance on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Just take a chance on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Take a chance on
Take a chance on me

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]
