Metal Warriors LyricsEvery one of us has heard the call
Brothers of true metal
Proud and standing tall
We know the power within us
Has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal
There's magic in us all

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, I said leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend

There's metal in the air tonight
Can you hear it call?
If you ain't got the balls to take it
You can leave the hall
You might also likeHeavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hallEmbed
