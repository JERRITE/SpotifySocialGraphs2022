Call Someone LyricsCall someone, tell them how you feel
Call someone and tell them what you think is wrong
Be the crowds, show it how you feel
Show it all the ways you've been taught to feel

And the bigger you are, the harder you fall
You just need to call and let someone know
And the fast you think, is the time that you'll need
Just to say hello

Loose some time, trying not to break
Trying to be hard "Unknown part"
Change of hearts, changing how you feel
Call someone and let them know how good you feel
And the bigger you are, the harder you fall
You just need to call and let someone know
And the faster you think, is the time that you'll need
Just to say hello

Nothing ever happens, and nothing ever fits
But your keeping up with it
Gonna take what wrong connection, the one that you feels
Gonna make you something

And the bigger you are, the harder you fall
You just need to call and let someone know
And the faster you think, about who wins it
Is the time that you'll need...You might also likeEmbed
