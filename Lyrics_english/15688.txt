Lyrics fusion [verse 1] 
 It was what we decided a long time ago 
 I know it makes sense to make you like this, without me 
 I could be able to destroy me, for you 

 [Pre Coro] 
 When I found you we knew that love exists 
 And I never thought to be so close to your aura 

 [Chorus] 
 Only then can you see the fusion of souls 
 Only then can you be who you want here 
 [Verse 2] 
 With your brightness you destroy sadness 
 With your kisses you give me peace of mind, freedom 
 Although I know you will not return 
 Although I know I can wait here 
 I could be able to destroy me, for you 

 [Pre Coro] 
 When I found you we knew that love exists 
 And I never thought to be so close to your aura 

 [Departure - Choir] 
 Only then can you see the fusion of souls 
 Only then can you be who you want here 

 Only then can you see the fusion of souls 
 Only then can you want you hereyou Might Also Likeembed
