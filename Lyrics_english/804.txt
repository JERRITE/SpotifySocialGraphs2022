[Intro]
One more night is the only thing I ask for
I don't know what you made me gave me with you
And I look for her and write to her, and I never get her
You forgot that even together 'dawn'

[Chorus]
And I will not let you pass
When you want to start over
In the attempt you will fail
And to another on your face I'm going to kiss
I am not going to let you pass
When you want to start over
In the attempt you will fail
And to another on your face I'm going to kiss
[Verse 1]
I'm going to kiss another in front of you for what you see what it feels like
I bought you gucci and you got snake
If not, the devil, you are non -believer
Your friend whenever I spend, you speaking between tooth '
Of me is pending and has a suitor ', haha
But I don't care, I'm going to the following
Despite how bad you were
I would do it very rich, another sees '(-tra ve')
I swear, baby, ah (-ro, baby)
She always asks me to give her (hard to give her)
And you 'love it to' and it's one to see '(one to see')
She wants to enlarge her double D (A double D)
And I'm in To's Lao ', but they don't see me
Another will win the Mercedes Benz

[Chorus]
I will not let you pass
When you want to start over
In the attempt you will fail
And to another on your face I'm going to kiss
I am not going to let you pass
When you want to start over
In the attempt you will fail
And to another on your face I'm going to kiss

[Verse 2]
Now it's you there and I here
I became addicted to you like a user
Crack's covers, ey
And what wants to 'is to leave me without cash
Although whom I have now is present '
You know that the desire are always
Tell what is a human without sin
Let's do what we were doing long, okay
One more night, I eat 'after dinner
But you can't say Na ', your boyfriend is another fingertips
You know me, ma ', I do it after smoking
She is my staff, he
