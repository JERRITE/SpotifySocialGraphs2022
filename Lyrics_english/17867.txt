R8 Lyrics [Intro]
M, they know the name (everyone) because it is really split (proper)
On the base (hey) heavy flow, it is a Marcantonio (ouh)
I don't get in line, I want my gold plaque (gold)
You don't make a lira not even if he reciprocates the minting (hahaha)
I will pass suddenly (blow) like a batch of the lot
I will guide that R8, I will put you under (VROOM)
I will leave my place only when I am dead (R.I.P.)
Until then they will suffer me- (hahaha)
Eh, eh, eh, eh (volume three, m)
[Verse]
They are better than all colleagues
No, I don't want to be a controversy (uh)
I'm sorry, but I have no competitor
I laugh, they tickle me (hahaha)
If I need Sneakers or right clothes
Yes, I call Domenico (Dome ')
My fuck face, but you don't adjust it
Not even with the editor (UOH, UOH)
My flow is a congenital defect
I read some texts
I recommend a speech therapy test (uoh, uoh)
I write like esoteric text
On fresh bodies, trampling pieces of skulls (ah)

I am a caloric meal, a canonical step
You fucking comedian
I ran like the alcohol content (huh?)
I don't give a damn about the doctor (hahaha)
Fly Low, Fly Low (uoh)
I do not step it, not the step (uoh)
I don't get pissed off, frat√®, fattening (uoh)
First interlocking after built -in
Cola the fat, drips the fat
Each rapper does not suffer me
I play an arm for me that the evil eye makes me
Makes the clown, writes another plagiarism
I'm a caravaggio, he a scribble
My Rusha team does not fall back (no)
Mount Rushmore with stone faces (Oh)
Dirty money in black, noriega (oh)
Until I see you dead in the display case (oh)
My life is an outdoor cinema
I'm with Sarah Connor, we will save the world (Yeah)
My new girl, friar ', is a dream
When I die I want both in the sleepy might alo like3embed
