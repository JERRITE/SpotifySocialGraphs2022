I hate loving you Lyrics [lyrics by "I hate love"]

[Verse 1: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
You have me and leave, you make me wait
Do not deliver anything in return
You pray and my bare feet again
They stay for your charm

[Pre-Coro 1: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
Way, you take me, you raise me without stopping
I run and stumble upon my naivety
Lost awake, entangled in your way of getting involved
Oh, how I hate loving you!
[Chorus: Both, Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
More than denying it, I would like to forget it
But there is something between the two
Let your heart feel something
Take everything more seriously I tell you goodbye
I hate you, I love you, I love you, I hate you
Oh, how I hate loving you! (Oh, ay)
I hate you, I love you, I love you, I hate you
Oh, how I hate loving you! (Oh, ay)

[Verse 2: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
You smile and give him another chance
To this traveling love
Although it seems that it is in your reality
Kneel to fear

[Pre-Coro 2: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
I give you, I follow you, I raise myself and when dreaming
Your insecurity takes me to the ground
Lost awake, entangled in your way of getting involved
Oh, how I hate loving you!

[Chorus: Both, Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
More than denying it, I would like to forget it
But there is something between the two
Let your heart feel something
Take everything more seriously I tell you goodbye
I hate you, I love you, I love you, I hate you
Oh, how I hate loving you! (Oh, ay)
I hate you, I love you, I love you, I hate you
Oh, how I hate loving you! (Oh, ay)

More than denying it, I would like to forget it
But there is something between the two
Let your heart feel something
Take everything more seriously I tell you goodbye
I hate you, I love you, I love you, I hate you
Oh, how I hate loving you! (Oh, ay)
