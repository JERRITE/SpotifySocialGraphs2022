Still Sinning Lyrics[Intro: Uncs, KayyKayy & GP]
Gang shit
Free all the G's
Simpz
Sinners
Sin Squad step
Fuck the opps
Sinners
Get it fucking correct
We don’t lie on tracks
Ching
Gunna!
[Verse 1: GP]
Old school days with Sin Squad
Man used to lurk with the flicks (Sinners)
Dusty pedal bike
Man used to pray that my chain don't rip
Shh got drenched too much
Should've stayed up to swimming in (Yuck)
Talk about dirt on the Lane
These times the Lane does serious hits
Masked up looking all gang
Sin on the six love shh on his clip
There’s about ten dons on the opp block
Still bine for a nigga that slips
Four man up in a hot box
I'm riding with men, not kids (Not kids)
Four man up in a hot box
Plus two badders, short and thick
Life's a bitch, do a man dirty if you fuck with 6ix
If you ain't involved, stay at home
'Cah me, I put corn in clips
My littlе bro Blackz, strapped in the trap
While you was at homе and shit
Late nights up in the T house
Playing with a hobo, grow and cling
Hella bad B's wan' link up
But I ain't in it the mix up
Big bro just copped two nines of nose
He didn’t even ask for a picture
Back to the spot, pick up a cloth
Put that shit by the mixer
Trap phone bling, constant ring
Now he’s putting shit on my Insta
PL bop, we make our gwop
Slap shop on any man's block
So what if he busses his block?
Know some snizz that will drench man’s top
Drench man's top then slide right off
Splash man down from his head to his socks
Splash man down from his head to his socks

Flyboy gang, not FBG
I'm with double O, he ain't GD
Chocolate darling, custard creams
In love with the Park Lane G’s
Sin Squad lurk, step on your turf, ah
Blacked out like SD
Nah, I mean like GP
4 door skrt, them man disperse
Sin Squad lurk, serious dirt, ah
Should've got left in the dirt
Like war is war, are you ready?
Donny got caught at the Aves like ready
***** defend your block like Terry
Sin Squad pull up and them man dash
Four door whip pullin' up at Aves, 'kay
All these long plaits
They're clear like Mad Max
Sin Squad raps, serious facts
When we pull up, the opps them dash
Sick in my head, you know I'm mad
Four door whip, pulling up with Ramz
Four door whip, pulling up with Ramz

[Verse 3: KayyKayy]
My Laners bop, my Sinners step
Slide 'round there, drench man, who's next? (Who, who?)
I swear that day was ments'
One more poke and you would've been dead
You don't want to see three man in a four door
Or four man on two stolen 'peds
That's nothing but serious Sinners with swords and spinners tryna' crash again
It's intense, couldn't get him so we got his friend
Four door pull up and them man jet
They leave their friends, we could never be like them
Sin Squad slide with swords and skengs
All swords and skengs, tryna get an opp wet
Countless times on the opp block
But more time when we leave, it's stress
I remember living in the paigon ends
I had like three or four paigon friends
Still done drills on the paigons dem
Still get love from a paigon jezz
Step 'round there, like fuck it
I wan' get close and touch him
Uncs just screamed out "Bun him!"
Six just squeezed that Russian
Ain't seen Jakes so we're cuttin'
Sin Squad splashed up more than a dozen
Park Lane bop, tryna cause a reduction
Drench man's top 'til the boy can't function
Do up an opp, no frontin'
You can act all violent on the 'net
In reality it's faux
Step 'round there like who's on who
Pull up on your block they get found in queue
Four door pull up they have no clue (None)
No names on tracks
Really put these guys on the news
ShhhEmbed
