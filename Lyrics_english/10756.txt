INCREDIBLE WORLD Lyrics[Verse 1]
Not much to sing about
Not much to dream about
But the end
Don't have a conscious anymore
Can't find the process anymore
I don't bend

[Verse 2]
Living in this circus carousel
It's a conscious effort
To control uprisings in myself
In my cell I see
You in bed with enemies
When I lost the will to give
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sounds lame
But it's true
I can't complain
But I do
I try to tell the truth
I tried to tell the truth

[Chorus]
Oh who?
Let all this water rush in?
Got a particular way
Of getting under my skin
Oh who?
Let all this water rush in?
What an incredible world
We find our bodies stuck in

[Verse 3]
We wake up
We freak out
We make love
We make out again
You could wring
A century out of it
But it all depends
You might also like[Verse 4]
If you're lucky
Find some lovely ways
To spend your time and money
Maybe buy a bit of space
Someone to embrace
A purpose
A calling or two
And reproduce
Nothing better to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Bad days
Nothing new
I got black shades
To hide from you
When it don't compute
They say to find the good

[Chorus]
Oh who?
Let all this water rush in?
Got a particular way
Of getting under my skin
Oh who?
Let all this water rush in?
What an incredible world
We find our bodies stuck inEmbed
