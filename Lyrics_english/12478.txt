Who’s Gonna Love Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
All those times when I imagined
What it'd be like to have my freedom
Not be so uptight, live my best life
Oh what a fool I was only dreamin'

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, down
I wonder who's gonna love me now
I'm going down, down, down
Well tell me who's gonna love me now
[Verse 2]
All day out here workin'
Will my burden ever be light
Can't accept it, I feel rejected
Another wasted Saturday night

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, down
I wonder who's gonna love me now
I'm going down, down, down
Well tell me who's gonna love me now

[Bridge]
Face down in the pavement
I could use a little healing
Wonder if I held you
Could you see past all my weakness

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, down
I wonder who's gonna love me now
Down, down, down
Well tell me who's gonna love me now
I'm going down, down, down, down
Love me now
I'm going down, down, down
Well tell me who's gonna love me nowYou might also likeEmbed
