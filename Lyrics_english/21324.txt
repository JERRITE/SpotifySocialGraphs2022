Things My Father Said Lyrics[Verse 1]
The things my father said
Would make me a better man
Hard work and the love of friends
A woman that understands

I hope my father knows
The seeds we've sown still grow
At night, I go to sleep
And pray he is watching over me
[Refrain]
Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I remember when
You taught me to tie my shoes
One thing I will never forget
Is the day that I lost you

I hope you always know
That car that we built will always roll

[Refrain]
Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say goodbye

[Bridge]
And if you have a dream
You better hang on for dear life
And when the cold wind blows
Just let it pass you by
You might also likeYeah, things my father said
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Somewhere there's a star
That's shining so bright
That I can see you smile
And all that I need is one last chance
Just to hear you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Just to hear you say
Goodbye
GoodbyeEmbed
