I fell in love Lyrics ["I fell in love"]

[Verse 1]
Life began to change me
The night I met you
I had little to lose
And the thing continued like this
I with my striped support
And my hair half do
I thought: "This is still a child"
But what am I going to do?
[Pre-car]
Is what I was looking for
The doctor recommending
I thought I was dreaming, oh-oh, oh-oh
What was I complaining about?
I don't know what I was thinking
I'm going to heaven and I'm kicking, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I fell in love, I encaled
I saw him alone and threw myself
I fell-one
ME INA-NA-NAMO-
Look what a beautiful thing
What a round mouth
I like that bench
And I danced until I got tired
Until I tired, I danced
And I got-one-born
We fall in love
A MOJITO, TWO MOJITOS
Look what beautiful eyes
I stay another little while

[Verse 2]
With you I would have 10 children
Let's start with a couple
I just tell you
In case you want to practice
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
The only thing I'm saying
Let's get to know
This is what I have proposing, oh-oh, oh-oh
We are getting excited
Everything is resulting
How good we are having, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I fell in love, I encaled
I saw him alone and threw myself
I fell-one
ME INA-NA-NAMO-
Look what a beautiful thing
What a round mouth
I like that bench
And I danced until I got tired
Until I tired, I danced
I fell-one
We fall in love
A MOJITO, TWO MOJITOS
Look what beautiful eyes
I stay another little while

[Bridge]
I never thought it was so
How would you look at me
I thought about it all night
This is pa 'me or pa' more nobody
E-are pa 'me or pa' more nobody
This is pa 'me or pa' more nobody
E-e-are pa 'me or pa' more nobody
[Chorus]
I fell in love, I encaled
I saw him alone and threw myself
I fell-one
ME INA-NA-NAMO-
Look what a beautiful thing
What a round mouth
I like that bench
And I danced until I got tired
Until I tired, I danced
I fell-one
We fall in love
A MOJITO, TWO MOJITOS
Look what beautiful eyes
I stay another little while

[Bridge]
I never thought it was so
How would you look at me
I thought about it all night
This is pa 'me or pa' more nobody
E-are pa 'me or pa' more nobody
This is pa 'me or pa' more nobody
E-e-are pa 'me or pa' more nobody15embed
