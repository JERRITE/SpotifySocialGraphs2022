Shopping Spree Lyrics[Intro: Lil Pump & Baka Not Nice]
When I go shopping (Ooh, Jetski)
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
When I go shopping, I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe (Yeah)
I want a bitch with double Ds (Ds)
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Lean)
I just went on a shopping spree (Yeah)
When I go shopping I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe (Uh-huh)
I want a bitch with double Ds (Ooh)
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach (South Beach)
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Ooh, yeah)
I just went on a shopping spree (Ooh)
[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
You wanna get geeked, come on (Come on)
Smashing a bitch and her tampon (Yeah)
We ratchet as fuck where I'm from
Knock on his door with a choppa, ding-dong (Ding-dong)
Dropped out, now I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
I'm off two beans in a Nascar
I'm in Calabasas, servin' up junkies (Brr)
I just heard my auntie up in a backyard
I'm a rockstar and I fucked on a pornstar
I crash a car and I went bought a new one (Ooh)
I'ma go boot up
I'm in a label meeting and I pulled up with two sluts (Two sluts)
Let's go boot up (Ooh), and I got a lean gut just like Buddha (Like Buddha)
But I might shoot ya (Ooh), ride around with a 38-year-old cougar (Fafa, fafa)

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Sheck Wes]
When I go shopping I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe (Yeah)
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
I want a bitch with double Ds (Ds)
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Lean)
I just went on a shopping spree (Yeah)
When I go shopping I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe (Uh-huh)
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
I want a bitch with double Ds (Ooh)
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach (South Beach)
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Ooh, yeah)
I just went on a shopping spree (Ooh)

Yeah, bitch, bitch, bitch (Bitch, bitch, yeah)
I know they mad I'm rich (Rich)
I spend obnoxious (Uh-huh)
I need a pill, I'm sick (Achoo)
I might fly out your bitch (Uh-huh)
Niggas can't live my life (Uh-uh)
Niggas don't make no sense, yeah (Ching-ching)
Sheck Wes, I was born in the projects
Real killers, I know goons and the goblins
Drawbacks, put your ass in a coffin
My bitch bad, yeah, my girl so naughty
Can't lack, you get shot down where I live
Off the addy, man, like "there goes my eyelids"
I can't touch these hoes (Yeah), sit back and beat up her privates
I just bought a new car, cost 350 Gs (Bitch)
Lamborghinis, Performante speed (Zoom)
I'm not from Montana, bitch Sheck Wes from NYC (Facts)
When these hoes fuck with me (Facts), no shoppin' sprees (Bitch)

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Sheck Wes]
When I go shopping I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe (Yeah)
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
I want a bitch with double Ds (Ds)
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach
(Fa, fa, fa, fa)
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Lean)
I just went on a shopping spree (Yeah)
When I go shopping I buy everything I see (Ooh, brr)
What you want? I want that Patek Philippe
I want a bitch with double Ds
Look at my backyard, it's South Beach (It's South Beach)
I spend like 20 bands on lean (Ooh, yeah)
