These Nights Lyrics[Chorus: Rich Brian]
She tell me, "Settle down," what does it all mean?
Anything you want, baby, give it all to me
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady, alright
We can drive out, maybe end up in the hills
I do a lotta things, yeah, I do it for the thrill
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady, alright
These nights, these nights, yeah
They control me, you control me
[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
You know that I move like that
You know that I love too fast
You know I have sleepless nights
I cannot dream you right now
You love me, you want me
You want me here with you
You need me, you see me
And I'll never stop loving you
So don't tell me to leave, 'cause I won't
A boat full of holes it don't float
Baby, grab your keys and your coat
When you're 'round me it snows

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
She tell me, "Settle down," what does it all mean?
Anything you want, baby, give it all to me
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady, alright
We can drive out, maybe end up in the hills
I do a lotta things, yeah, I do it for the thrill
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady, alright
These nights, these nights, yeah
They control me, you control me

Said, "Who's gonna do it like me?"
Said, "Who's gonna love you like me?"
Said, "You're the only one I'm tryna see, to see"
I see it, 새겨 멋진 밤의 공기
내적 떨림, 숨결 하나까지 아찔
커진 love thing, 숨겨 all day
Oh, I love you baby
불빛 번져, lit me
I'm your new queen, 다뤄 보석같이
Love me, 때론 거친
You're everything, yeah, 꺼내 모든 story

[Chorus: CHUNG HA, Rich Brian & CHUNG HA]
She tell me, "Settle down," what does it all mean?
Anything you want, baby, give it all to me
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady tonight
We can drive out, maybe end up in the hills
I do a lotta things, yeah, I do it for the thrill
I can be your baby tonight
You can be my lady tonight
These nights, these nights, yeah
They control me, you control me, yeah
These nights, these nights, yeah
They control me, you control me, yeah5Embed
