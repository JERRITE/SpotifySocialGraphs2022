Shenzi
Yo, nobility
Adel, Palle (Fivestar)
16-4

[Verse 1: Adel]
They want to see the wings cut (nobility)
Therefore I have finger on the trigger
Sending Shooters, don't let them miss
As you sink, it's quicksand
Two grams in my rizla
Location, then I whistle
Now all of Sweden has me on its list
We are flowers, you are twigs
People play g√§h, but they sneaky a
Obviously you do this if you a pussy, yeah
Say my name, I'll be like a hiccup, yeah
I talk to a shooter, he said "who?", Yeah
He said "If you pray pointing, then I fix it" (bang, bang, bang)
More problems, friends decreased (yeah)
I smoke every joint like the last one, yeah (ah)
Once I have left the gate, may be cut, YEAH (Pow-Pow-Pow)
Forgive God that I was a sinner
Many of the older ones become fimmed
So clearly that our younger ones, they got wilder
On my street, all like -minded
In my circle, all of us are winners
I started serving salmon when Benim fished (Cash, Cash, Cash)
We shone so the whole center glittered (FIVestar)
Every fucking day, we kick civilians
So many horses, think I was a rider
People, they are snakes so I slipped
Therefore never trust any hypocrite (GITT), jah
[Refrain: Adel]
Flow, sci-fi
Five stars and we light up The Sky
The whole clicks ready to ride
I will come with a brother on a drive-by, yeah
My flow is sci-fi
Five stars and we light up The Sky
The whole clicks ready to ride
I will come with a brother on a drive-by, yeah (drive-by, yeah)

[Verse 2: P.J]
Now they ask why i so icy, yeah
When we shop, don't think price tag, yeah
Inside the kitchen, bakes no pizza, bre
You know them beside me, they are shitzade (shitz)
Threw the handsets for Aina listened
They say my flow, it's brilliant
Guzzen she is cold like Mona Lisa, YEAH
Swear that our texts get you shudder, yeah
Horror movie, one might believe it shudder (woh)
The cold spits if I happen to sneeze, yeah
Five Stars, Top Class, See us Lysa, Yeah (Shine)
We hairdressers but we don't cut frice, yeah
In my circle, only includes some, yeah (yeah)
Want to be on the boat but our sail already hoisted, yeah (mhm)
How many million? Let them miss, yeah (miss, yeah)
People take the map until they get lost, yeah (Gitt)
Sits in the German with the Russian, yeah
Smoke this joint as my last, yeah
It easy for one to hasta la vista, yeah
It easy for one to end up in a coffin
