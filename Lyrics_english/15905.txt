Lyrics enters my life [lyrics by "enters my life"]

[Verse 1]
Good evening, very nice; You were one more girl
After five minutes, you were already someone special
Without speaking, without touching something inside ignited
In your eyes he was late and forgot about the clock

[Verse 2]
These days by your side they taught me that in truth
There is no determined time to start loving
I feel something so deep that I can not explain
There is no reason or logic in my heart
[Chorus]
Enter my life, I'll open the door
I know that in your arms there will be no deserted nights
Come into my life, I'm begging you
I began to miss
But I started to need you later

[Verse 3]
Good evening, very nice; There is no longer anyone else
After this time together, I can't go back
You spoke to me, you touched me and you became my illusion
I want you to own of my heart

[Chorus]
Enter my life, I'll open the door
I know that in your arms there will be no deserted nights
Come into my life, I'm begging you
I began to miss
But I started to need you later

[Bridge]
Enter in my hours, save me now
Open your arms strong and let me in

[Chorus]
Enter my life, I'll open the door
I know that in your arms there will be no deserted nights (no more deserted nights)
Enter my life, I beg you (I beg you)
I began to miss
But I started to need you later
I began to miss
But I started to need you then IUU MIGHT ALSO Like2embed
