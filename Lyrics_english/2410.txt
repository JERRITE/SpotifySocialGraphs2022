Gone (Da Da Da) Lyrics[Intro]
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, da-da

[Verse 1]
Days like this I need you closer
To get me outta my mind
Get me outta my mind, yeah
Tryna turn off my emotions
But every time I try
Every time I try
[Chorus]
Vertigo set in 'til you come around
Feels like I'm fallin' two feet above ground
In a world of noise, you drown out the sound
Once you get me higher, no one's gonna talk me down

[Drop]
Stay close around
I know I let you down
But just don't cut me out
No, not now, we'll be gone too soon
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, da-da (Gone too soon)
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, da-da (Gone too soon)

[Verse 2]
Stay like this, I'm in the moment
Losin' track of our time
Losin' track of our time, yeah
Days like this feel like thеy're golden
I want this feelin' all night
Let's keep it goin' all night
You might also like[Chorus]
Vеrtigo set in 'til you come around
Feels like I'm fallin' two feet above ground
In a world of noise, you drown out the sound
Once you get me higher, no one's gonna talk me down

[Rise]
Stay close around
I know I let you down
But just don't cut me out
No, not now, we'll be gone too soon

[Drop]
Stay close around
I know I let you down
But just don't cut me out
No, not now, we'll be gone too soon
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, da-da (Gone too soon)
Mm-da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, mm-da-da
Da-da, da-da (Gone too soon)Embed
