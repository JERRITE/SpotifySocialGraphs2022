Another night at L.A. Lyrics [letter from "another night in L.A."]

[Verse 1]
Good morning'
I recognize it, I didn't write you a long time
Maybe by grief, maybe pride, cowardice
But today I got up thinking about you (thinking about you)
Good morning'
I write this while breakfast cools
Tell me everything, how much have you done? What about your life?
And I got up thinking about you (thinking about you)
[Chorus]
Today I left the old Mustang
How do you like, windows below
MÐµ has cost work to be without you
I spoil here
Another night at the (another night at the)
And although I like this life
Without you it is something unfair
I WANT I DO NOT SAVE TO BRING THE LIFE CRAZY
I leave and keep here, waiting for you
Another night at the (another night at the)

[Verse 2]
Another night in Los Angeles, I don't go out here
In your chat waiting for you to write to me 'something
This life is good, I do not deny it, however
That you are not with me with the guilt
Come back, that coffee cools me
Forgive the child, they were time 'of rebellion
Yesterday I looked at your photo and I with my heart broken
Because in the photo I must be supposed
Jungle Bell, when do I see you again?
If you come to my birthday I keep you pastel
If you pass by Lamelle Rose, you will see me with a poster
What tells you: "Go home, I am not that
That left you dinner
On the contrary, I make you food "
I wanted to be something different today
I will save the Rolls-Royce, Yeah

Today I left the old Mustang (OH-OH)
How much do you like, windows below (OH-OH, OH-OH)
It cost me work to be without you (OH-OH)
I wait for you here (OH-OH-OH)
Another night at the (another night at the)
And although I like this life (OH-OH)
Without you it is something unfair (OH-OH)
I want to take crazy life (OH-OH)
I leave and keep here, waiting for you
Another night at the (another night at the)

[Outro]
OH, WOH-OH, YEAH-EH-EH
Yeah-Oh
Another night, another night
No-Oh
Another night in Laembed
