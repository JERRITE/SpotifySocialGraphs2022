Kill me Lyrics ["Lyrics for me" ft. Archangel, Almighty, Bryant Myers, Baby Rasta, Noriel & Brytiago]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
YE-EH, YE-EH
You are good, baby, and without sending you
I want to smoke and give you until dawn
I swear that I like you, all of you

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Baby Rasta]
But what kills me
This is when Bellaca's face
He kisses with the friend and they are not legs
Fine, but in the tremendous bed Sata, Yeh
And what kills me
This is when Bellaca's face
You go down 'the zipper and you take it out
Fine, but in the tremendous bed Sata, Yey
[Verse 1: Archangel]
(Austin, Baby) Au!
I drank a syrup that is for cough
I asked for a little friend and brought me two
I put all night at the level God
I got the gift advanced by Santa Claus (wow)
Strong, it was not a blow of luck (no)
I gave him a pill and became indecent (Loquita)
Although it mediates the insane
I taught him this bug and got coherent
That's why she always calls me (Yeah)
Every time she is alone (aha)
When I arrive I mama (oh)
Very rich, no matter the time (hahaha)
It always manifests me (always)
Then take a nap (nap)
We wake up and climb on me
And to do so again

[Verse 2: Noriel]
(Noriel)
My baby is a daring (Ajá)
Wants to fuck me for life
The boyfriend a couple of times hit them (Wuh)
Because that bastard had her bored
Whenever I call it it comes right away
To 'what I like never forget (no)
You want me to tell you (ah)
She is going to be loyal to this bug while the bastard has life
He touches and dances me
If I go with the friend, I say that I bring her
He puts the phone in plane mode for never sounds and does not get distracted (aha)
We always throw more than one
It wrapped in smoke, smokes if I smoke
The baby says it is not leg, but they love the two pa 'one (wuh)

All the tricks she knows them (ah)
Fucking has the key
That we both think '
And in bed everything uses
It is a devil (it is a devil)
That na 'more think of me when Bellaca is
EH-EH, EH-EH, EH

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Baby Rasta]
But what kills me
This is when Bellaca's face
He kisses with the friend and they are not legs
Fine, but in the tremendous bed Sata, Yeh
And what kills me
This is when Bellaca's face
You go down the zipper and take it out
Fine, but in the tremendous bed Sata, Yeah

[Verse 3: Bryant Myers]
(Bryant Myers)
Today I vo 'to torture, baby, your body is a mural
Is that culot natural? I want to open it to you
As in The Purge, tonight I vo 'to debug
How long are you 'to last? That totito today I vo 'to saturate
You are a sick and this bug is the only one who is going to heal you
I know that you and your friend also love BI
You do Threesomes with Cojone '
They almost look like lebi ', baby, in my villa there are room service
Today I will make it complete until I get to the pelvis
To your ex when I saw it, I started to run to the line of the presby
[Verse 4: Brytiago]
(Brytiago, Baby)
When they give the 12, a phillie, little eyes, nobody knows them
One is like Rihanna the other is Amber Rose
Addicted with being daring, crazy with one to the other the rose
It is passed in you, looking for everyone to learn, '
I suck it and not until it ends
I drage it with my tongue full 'e baba
Without Phillies said he didn't take away
When you have relationships it is the one that is recorded (wuh)
Live traveling in ecstasy
You see it through the networks and it doesn't look like this
I am a Bellaco since I was born
I invited them to make a trio and both said yes-í
Sex is going to rain, excess pleasure
I don't know if he can be able to do the poses to do
Today I watched 'to fuck, I barely started
I abuse with you as the same abuse of the tramadols and the Pecocet

[Choir: Baby Rasta]
And what kills me
This is when Bellaca's face
You go down 'the zipper and take it out'
Fine, but in the tremendous bed Sata, Yeh

[Bridge 2: Almighty]
(Almighty, It's The Game Changer)
If your friend today cannot
I look for another to say yes and kiss each other
Then they make the six-new (Wuh)
The two touch and rain
I put them to smoke for them to rise
Baby, it's my fantasy, or do you dare?

[Verse 5: Almighty]
Your Roberto Clemente arrived, also your chayanne
I'm your pirate, I want to smoke with your cat
Baby, I hob the cheap kushy pounds
Low with the needle and robe, and I inject the Tecata
I kill me while it is portrayed
If you are a leg, I put my legs
They are powerful, the buffet 'of Ponderosa (a), they are thorns without roses
You are a book and I am the reader who always breaks them down (you know ')
May God forgive me, atheist to the condone '
I 'come inside and until today there are no pensions
Just my son and it's these bastards, Almighty!

[Verse 6: Bad Bunny & Archangel]
Baby, I am your Drake (Yeh), you are my Rihanna (Rihanna)
I am a beautiful, baby, but you feel me (wuh)
I am a fan of your mouth, your buttocks, your tits, your eyes and your skin
But it is that face 'and Bellaca that makes me put it to you
No bitch comes (no)
Janguear goes out and does not arrive (Wuh)
They have a boyfriend, but they stick them
My bug is your hookah and it is not taken off (it is not taken off)
Baby, you are Bellaca
Well, send the location pa 'that confirms it (au)
I giving you a bug and your boyfriend I put in Planet Fitness

[Outro: Archangel & Almighty]
Auuu, Austin Baby, Arcangel Pa
Bad Bunny, Bryant Myers
Almighty
Noriel, Brytiago, Baby Rasta
Hear This Music, tell him Luian, Mambo Kingz
'Pérate give me a break, Mambo Kingz, oh yeah
Oh, Alex Killer, haha
I know that you were waiting for me to mention the bug
Or what do you want, to speak of rifles and gun '?
If at the last minute what I'm going to put you is the bug (uh!)
