Always Be There Lyrics[Refrain]

[Verse 1]
If you ask me about love
And what I know about it
My answer would be
It's everything about Allah
The pure love, to our souls
The creator of you and me
The heavens and the whole universe
The one that made us whole and free
The guardian of His true believers
[Chorus]
So when the time gets hard
There's no way to turn
As He promised He will always be there
To bless us with His love and His mercy
Cuz as He promised He will always be there
He's always watching us, guiding us
And He knows what's in our little hearts
So when you lose your way
To Allah you should turn
Cuz as He promised He will always be there

[Verse 2]
He brings us out from the darkness into the light
Subhanallah capable of everything
Shouldn't never feel afraid of anything
As long as we follow His guidance all the way
Through our short time we have in this life
Soon it will all be over
And we'll be in His heaven and we'll all be fine

[Chorus]
So when the time gets hard
There's no way to turn
As He promised He will always be there
To bless us with His love and His mercy
Cuz as He promised He will always be there
He's always watching us, guiding us
And He knows what's in our little hearts
So when you lose your way
To Allah you should turn
Cuz As He promised He will always be there
