TranslationsPortuguêsEspañolСрпскиYour Age Lyrics[Verse]
Not a secret, not a problem
Not a symptom or cure
Not a villain, not a mistake
Not in the eyes of God
Not a weakness, not a failure
Not a saviour, oh, no
Not a secret, not a problem (Problem, problem)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
I ain't a number you can ever divide
You crossed the line by multiplying the lies
I survived the social suicide
Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
Decisions were not mine
You closed me off, a jail personified
Yeah, I survived a social suicide
[Chorus]
'Cause now that I'm your age, I just can't imagine
Why did you do it? What the hell were you thinking?
'Cause I'm not a secret and I'm not a problem
Why did you do it? What the hell were you thinking?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause now that I'm your age
(Not a secret, not a problem, not a secret, not a martyr)
'Cause now that I'm your age
(Not a mistake, not a weakness, not a failure, not a problem)
'Cause now that I'm your age
(I survived the social suicide, not a secret, not a problem)
'Cause now that I'm your age
(Yeah, I survived the social suicide, not a failure, not a martyr)

[Bridge]
You know what?
We all have a monster inside of us
But we have a choice, we get to decide
But you
You fucked with my life

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah (Ayy, yeah)
Ayy, yeah, a-a-a-ayy, yeah
(That will never be me, yeah, I can see you clearly)
(Yeah, you better fear me, yeah, you better fear me)
A-a-a-ayy, yeah (Ayy, yeah)
Ayy, yeah (Ayy, yeah)
(That will never be me, yeah, I can see you clearly)
(Yeah, you better fear me, yeah, you better fear me)
Ayy, yeah, a-a-a-ayy, yeah
A-a-a-ayy, yeah, (Ayy, yeah)
(That will never be me, yeah, I can see you clearly)
