Release You Lyrics[Verse 1: Carmody]
Once there was a melody
That came from the depths of me
That's how it starts...
It came from another place
Trail I can never trace
No matter how hard
And it's strange how the story's yours now
As it leaves my voice
There was not a choice
But to release you...
[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)

[Verse 2: Tom Misch]
Once there was too much too say
Though I should've find a way
And that's how it starts
Sorrows and ecstasy
Grow all these words to me
No matter how hard
And it's strange how
The story's yours now
As it leaves my voice
There was not a choice
But to release you

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)

In another's mind...
And you look like a stranger to me

And now you lay
In another's mind...
And you look like a stranger to me
To me, yeah

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)Embed
