[Chorus: duki & ak4: 20]
Pa 'ty' toy ready, never Busy (Busy, Busy)
As Jhayco said, I'm easy, 'Toy Easy (you already knew)
But forgetting that ass is difficult (it's difficult)
I don't care if you are leo or you are Pisci '(Uh!)
I smoke Cali Kush as of the Geezy (like Geezy)
The diamond 'stand out as the Yeezys (Four Twenty; like Yeezys)
I know that Pichea has a cat 'in Crisi' (heh, who more?; Crisi ', Crisi', Crisi ')
I want to ride as my first bike (ey; bike, bike)
[Verse 1: AK4: 20]
And that you load 'e' unique, cause panic
Multiple 'pa' pays the plastic
Rally mode running in your 'curve', mommy, I'm fast

A devil that models Givenchy (Givenchy)
It has good vibes, but it doesn't make Feng Shui (Ajá)
When he smokes, the eye 'look like Beijing (Wuh!)
If you give it down the jean squeezes (prr!)

I smoke like a Rasta (UH), I only lack the Draadlock '(yes)
Tell your friend that if you want this
And roleamo 'as if this were a party' e dj tiësto (oh)
Gafa 'Christian Dior, between smoke and alcohol

Today is' night 'of terror, your ass in' El Powerball
And if not chicho I become Hulk
