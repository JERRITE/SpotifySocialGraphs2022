Rotten to the Core (D3 Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Thomas Doherty]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Dove, Booboo, Sofia & Cameron]
They  say I'm trouble, they say I’m bad
Fire  in my belly, so don't make me mad
A dirty no-good, down to the bone
I'll take that trophy, back to my zone
So  I’ve got some mischief in my blood
My  fashion's wicked Hands off my gloves
They think I'm callous, a low-life hood
The  times are changing, bad is the new good (Ha ha ha ha)
[Pre-Chorus: Dove & Sofia]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Chorus 1: Dove, Booboo, Sofia & Cameron]
I'm  rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the core, I’m rotten to the
I’m rotten to the core

[Verse 2: China Anne, Thomas, Sarah, Jadah, *All*]
(Yeah)
Long as I'm leader, of this lost isle
There’ll always be a little evil, behind my smile
Don't double cross me, I'll get you hooked (Ha ha ha ha)
You think I'm kidding? Just take a look
I’m not a sweetheart, I'm not your friend
But you better invite me, or taste revenge
I'm on the hustle, take what I can get
Show me the money
*You ain't seen nothing yet* (Ha ha ha ha ha)

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2: VKs]
I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more? (For more)
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the (Ahh!), I'm rotten to the (Woo!)
I'm rotten to the core, core (Ahh!)
Rotten to the core (Hey, hey)
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the coreEmbed
