Stomp! - single version LyricsSteppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up let's blast the jams and ride

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived it's alive
Everybody take it to the top

We're gonna stomp all night in the neighborhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party till the morning light
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
The set is hot there's people wall to wall
Old gones young things short ones standing tall

So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone
Everybody take it to the top we're gonna

We're gonna stomp all night in the neighborhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party till the morning light

We're gonna stomp all night in the neighborhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party till the morning light
