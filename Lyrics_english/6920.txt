[Chorus: Randy, Tito el Bambino]
When I feel 'the boom of this intense perreo
Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you
When I feel 'the boom of this intense perreo
Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you

[Verse 1: Tito el Bambino, Randy]
The bambino gathered with the most loose
And now there is no break
They collect packages that I take them
What do you want me to tell you?
Hey

Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you
When I feel 'the boom of this intense perreo
Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you

If you amaze that I take them
Bambino at last, owner of this game
Killing the league now with the newest
Loose, loose, without fear
They tell me that you don't break a dish
But in your face you see what you are looking for (HMM)
After pair of sticks, a caco, a last

[Pre-Caro: Randy]
Let it fall
It will fall alone

[Chorus: Randy, Tito el Bambino]
When I feel 'the boom of this intense perreo
Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you
When I feel 'the boom of this intense perreo
Task me the guille and calm
That you are in a skirt and you see you to '
You faltered, my combo linked you
