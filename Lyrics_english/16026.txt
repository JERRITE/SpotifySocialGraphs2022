Til I Forget About You Lyrics[Verse 1: Kendall Schmidt]
Get a call on a random afternoon
I pick it up and I see that it's you (It's you)
Like my heart, you were breaking the news
You say it's over, it's over, it's over
Heading out 'cause I'm out of my mind
All my friends are gonna see me tonight
Staying here 'til the sun starts to rise
And I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

[Chorus: All]
Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do anything that I have to
'Till I forget about!
Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do anything that I have to
[Post-Chorus: All]
'Till I forget about you!
Till I forget about you!

[Verse 2: Carlos Pena Jr.]
And you thought I'd be here on my own (Oh, oh)
Waiting for you to knock on my door (Oh, oh)
Since you left, I don't wait by the phone
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
Found a place where I can lose myself (Oh, oh)
And just leave your memory on the shelf (Oh, oh)
See I'm fine, no I don't need nobody else
'Cause I'm, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

[Chorus: All]
Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do anything that I have to
'Till I forget about!
Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do anything that I have to

[Post-Chorus: All]
'Till I forget about you!

Spending money like you don't mean a thing
Going crazy, now don't even think
I'm losing my mind, It's all I can do
'Til I forget about you, woah

[Chorus: All]
Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do anything that I have to
'Till I forget about!
Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you!

[Post-Chorus: Logan Henderson, All]
Oh, oh, oh-woah
'Til I forget about you!
'Til I forget about you, woah, woah, oh
I can't forget about you!13Embed
