Kolors Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Purple tree, plus I got this brown in me
Curly yellow dancin' on me
Said she smell the green on me
And she straight from California
Freaky as she wanna be
Told me she like boys and girls
Oh well, that's okay with me
[Chorus]
And she said
"My old boo left me blue, I really loved her
So cold and so cruel, so many colors"
Play hoes like ProTools, can't never trust 'em, trust 'em, trust 'em, trust 'em
Nah, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all

[Verse]
When I think about it, I just want a coupe
With a lil' boo, with the same coupe as me, different color
I been gettin' out here
But really the more known I get
I just been peepin these niggas' colors
Since I left the Lou'
Life ain't all black and white
Beautiful, peepin' the different colors
I could never choose
I like my booches in bunches
My babies all different colors
So what do you say? (Ayy)
Why don't we dip to the crib or some shit?
My gang got it crackin' like lips in the wind
I been burnin' my burdens and sippin; on sins
Whole lot on my plate (Heh)
Them yams goin' down soon as I get a chance
Been busy, this music shit tyin' up my hands
But it's on when I get ho-ome, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
