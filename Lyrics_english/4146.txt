Sex, sweat and heat Lyrics [letter of "sex, sweat and heat" ft. Ñejo & Dalmata]

[Intro]
Hello? Hello, baby, what else, then?

[Pre-car: J Alvarez]
I'm calling you
Because I need more about you
There is something of your voice that seduces me
And it makes me feel like you were my
And I know that you feel the same as me
For here it keeps raining
And I keep thinking about the last time
That I made you a woman
[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Why so far, Girl?
If I am here
Thinking of you
Making mischief for you, girl
Why so far, Girl?
If I'm here (if I'm here, girl)
Thinking of you
Making mischief for you, girl

[Verse 1: Dalmata]
And I don't know if you remember that day (day)
I drunk and crazy, you release and Lucí'a (Wuh)
We fumed ', I arrived' to the room and path excitely (ha ha!)
I did it 'until the other day
And even with the light pledge
Co-co-co-as you didn't call me that's why I'm calling you
Pa 'see if I remember' to 'how good the balacor'
That day, today again and with the light he turned on '(he turned on')
I do it until the next day, aha (uhh)

[Bridge: Dalmata]
Baby, tell me yes
It happens to you as
That when the night falls and does not heat the sun
I remember that night
I made love to you
Sex, sweat and heat (EH)
Tell me if it happens to you as
That when the night falls and does not heat the sun
I remember that night (night)
I remember that night
Ieh-ieh-ieh

[Verse 3: Ñejo]
Good luck that he gave me a couple of photo '
If I knew 'the cap' that I have made in name 'and that toto
What am I fall in love? Not a fool
And I don't get a guard '
But I had to go to the barracks and made a complaint for theft
And the side that was in turn gave me his explanation
That they do not imprison anyone for stealing a heart
And if I could give him to take him into time
Would return exactly to the very just moment
That he put in four in front of me and said:
"Eat the ass that is going to be the first to have ate"
Since that sees', as I see 'more' I have never come
I need me to hot 'another go', I'm cold
Looking for an equal to how many I have put him
I got how many thing ', hemo' made until trio '
But in a true ', in truth' that no one stops me
And when I put it on the other and 'thinking about your face
[Pre-car: J Alvarez]
I'm calling you
Because I need more about you
There is something of your voice that seduces me
And it makes me feel like you were my
And I know that you feel the same as me
For here it keeps raining
And I keep thinking about the last time
That I made you a woman

[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Why so far, Girl?
If I am here
Thinking of you
Making mischief for you, girl
Why so far, Girl?
If I'm here (if I'm here, girl)
Thinking of you
Making mischief for you, girl
