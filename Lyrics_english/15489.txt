Shabadabada Lyrics (return to the appetite, boys)
(Eat Push into It, Darling, Do It, Shaman)

I know where love is
In some asteroid in an elevator
In a corner on the Internet
On Mount Himalaya or in some coffee

In the north or south
It will arrive for me
Can be
I know where love is
In some safe or freezer
Lying down
Maybe in a poem or in any song

In the shadow or in the light
It will arrive for you
Can be
How to guess
Where this

Shabdabada Shabdabada
In the center of the planet
Shabdabada Shabdabada
Forgotten on the sidewalk
Shabdabada Shabdabada
In a crater on the moon
Shabdabada Shabdabada
In thunder or rain

In green or blue
Maybe I will find it
Can be

I know where love is
It can be only in the imagination
There will be no
If any of these afternoons I will discover it
You Might Also like the shadow ...

Shabadabada ...

It will be for you
Can be
At what time will he arrive
I do not know
And how to guess whether love
It will arrive for me

Shabadabada ...
