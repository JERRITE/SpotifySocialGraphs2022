I don't know if it's love Lyrics [lyrics by "I don't know if it's love"]

[Verse 1: Jesús Navarro]
It was a special night to fall in love, mm-mm
I don't know if I was going to find you, but I went to look for you

[Pre-Caro: Jesús Navarro]
And when I looked at you, I couldn't resist it
And when I approached, I no longer knew what to say
And on that night, from you I was bewitched
[Chorus: Jesús Navarro]
I don't know if it's love what I feel today
The heart beats stronger
Could it be that love has come to the end?
I love the idea that you are
You who will teach me

[Verse 2: Jesús Navarro]
I wanted to steal the honey that hides on your lips, mm-mm
And caress that skin that has me nailed, uh, not-not

[Pre-Caro: Jesús Navarro]
And when I kissed you, I began to discover
All that love you saved for me
And on that night, from you I was bewitched

[Chorus: Jesús Navarro]
I don't know if it's love what I feel today
The heart beats stronger
Could it be that love has come to the end?
I love the idea that you are
You who will teach me

[Bridge: Jesús Navarro]
It could be that you and I are two hearts
That fate gathered

I don't know if it's love what I feel today
The heart beats stronger
Could it be that love has come to the end?
I love the idea that you are
You who will teach me

[Instrumental interlude]

[Chorus: Jesús Navarro]
I don't know if it's love what I feel today
The heart beats stronger
Could it be that love has come to the end?
I love the idea that you are you
I love the idea that you are
You who are going to show me
