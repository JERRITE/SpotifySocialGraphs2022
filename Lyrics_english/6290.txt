Out of My League Lyrics[Intro]
More than just a dream
More than just a dream
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you
To come and save my life
All the days I waited for you
You know the ones who said
I'd never find someone like you
[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl
Mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain
Become a simple fact

[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream
