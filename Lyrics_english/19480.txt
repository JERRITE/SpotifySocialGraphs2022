â€‹one of one Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lonely, but not when you hold me
Your beauty weighs on me
This feeling's too good
Lovely, can't believe you love me
Your warm chest beats under me
This feeling's too good

[Verse 2]
Honestly, your lips would never lie to me
I can taste your love approaching me
This feeling's too good
Lovely, I can't believe you love me
On a warm spring night you stunned me
This feeling's too goodYou might also like2Embed
