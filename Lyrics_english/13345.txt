​a kiss goodbye LyricsYeah, I love her so much but she don't feel the same
Got butterflies up in my stomach got to get em tamed
She zoned me out, she tried to act like she don't know my name
I feel alone I'm getting cold under the pourin' rain
Switching up on me, like strobe lights
Language getting colourful the yellin' getting old like
I wanna just be honest with her can we take it slow
I'm not ready for a girl who treats me bad, that's all I know

I've been feeling off, what's new
Guess I never saw what's true
I don't wanna try to make things right
I just wanna hold hands tonight
I've been feeling off, what's new?
Guess I never saw what's true
I don't wanna try to make things right
I just wanna kiss one last time

I remember where you came from
Up north old town on a lake house
Big family a lot of breakdowns
Strict mom you were never 'allowed to stay out'

I'm star-struck when I'm with you and I drink
Starbucks to remind me of times (remind me of times)
When I'm not over yet (over yet)
That I'm not over yet (over yet)

I've been feeling off, what's new?
Guess I never saw what's true
I don't wanna try to make things right
I just wanna hold hands tonight

I've been feeling off, what's new?
Guess I never saw what's true
I don't wanna try to make things right
I just wanna kiss one last time

Yeah, if I bring it up she gon leave like autumn
Talkin' true feelings but she don't believe I got em
When we first met, swear she was so damn awesome
Had a thrift store vibe, now she so damn prada
You might also likeYeah, things change and I know that well
You wanna do bad things, baby, show don't tell
Treat me like a trophy and throw me on your shelf
But you'll forget that I'm there so it just won't help1Embed
