E36 Lyrics[Chorus]
E36 I’m riding down the street
Bitch I’m bout to make a song make it heat
I been up all night no sleep
I got two phones wit me
And yo shawty make em beep
Tell her Lets Go
(Gooo)

[Verse 1]
I ain’t talking Dababy
All these bitches wanna fuck
And they driving me crazy
In the dms showing love
Tryna have all my babies
Nah luv I’m cool
Think that hoe got some rabies
People tried to play me
Now I keep the tool wit me
Cause nowadays
Ion really know who really cool wit me
Bitch I’m in a stolo
Wit my niggas screaming yolo
Bitch we bout to hit a lick
But all these bitches wanna photo
Is you kidding me?
Bitches love me like John F. Kennedy
Prolly why these pussy niggas
Wanna get rid of me
Bitches in bed
Claiming that they missing me
Complaining bout they history
But somehow we got chemistry
Spent a bag on these Tiffany’s
That shit dont mean shit to me
She gon fuck my nigga outta spite
Just to fucking get tome
Location onna island and
They wonder how to get to me
If you my partner neva
Cross me or you a bitch to me
[Verse 2]
Faded in my living room
Off the drank I need some shrooms
Take a hit I might be doomed
Might  go visit god soon
Came in wit my own tune
Real life no cartoon
Hit the mic go baboon
I turned myself to a tycoon

[Chorus]
E36 I’m riding down the street
Bitch I’m bout to make a song make it heat
I been up all night no sleep
I got two phones wit me
And yo shawty make em beep
Tell her Lets Go
(Gooo)
I ain’t talking Dababy
All these bitches wanna fuck
And they driving me crazy
In the dms showing love
Tryna have all my babies
Nah luv I’m cool
Think that hoe got some rabies
