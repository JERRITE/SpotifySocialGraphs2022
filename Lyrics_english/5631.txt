When the End Comes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you're locked down inside of your head
You've gotten tangled up in your own web
Your right is wrong, your flight is grounded
But love never leaves a heart, where it found it, found it
You found it

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say I hardly knew you, oh
'Cause where would I be then when the end comes?
[Verse 2]
Looks like you're living out on an island
Did you leave a number where I would find it?
You get along, your head is clouded
Your lungs are full of air, but you're drowning, drowning
You're drowning

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say I hardly knew you, oh
'Cause where would I be then when the end comes?

[Bridge]
The part I'm holding onto would be the part that I'm losing, part that I'm losing for
My heart is going onto you, so be the heart that I'm choosing, heart that I'm choosing

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll fall into you (to you, to you)
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say I hardly knew you, oh
'Cause where would I be then when the end comes, comes, comes?

Someday, I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say I hardly knew you, oh
'Cause where would I be then when the end comes?You might also like7Embed
