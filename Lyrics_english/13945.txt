Everybody Wants Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I remember when we were young
Things were easy, we had such fun
And I know what we talked about
But let's hope that they don't find out

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
But I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
[Verse 2]
Take your mind back to rainy days:
We stayed inside and played those games
But you know what we talked about
'Cause you prayed they would not find out

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
But I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you

[Refrain]
If you really cared for me
Then you would take me with you, if you really cared for me
Then you would take me with you, if you really cared for me
If you really cared for me

[Verse 3]
I remember when we were young
Things were easy, we had such fun
And I know what we talked about
Let's hope that they don't find out
You might also like[Chorus]
Because everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me, now
But I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you

Hidden Track: Draw The Curtain

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
It's over, oh, so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again
It's over, oh, so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you won't believe me but I swear to god it's true
I know you won't believe me, well what am I supposed to do?
[Chorus: Matt Bowman & Jimmi Naylor, Jimmi Naylor]
It's over, oh, so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again
It's over, oh, so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again
It's over, oh, so over–

[Outro: Ryan Wilson]
Go back to the beginning again!
