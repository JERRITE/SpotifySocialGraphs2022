Again and again Lyrics [letter from "again and again" ft. Joyce Santana & Brray]

[Intro: Oken]
OK in
Baby, that bastard never pleases you
That's why you are unfaithful
Don't heat you like I know how to do it

[Chorus: Oken]
And that's why he calls me to de-e
And we do it again and again
Baby, I want to give it to you again and again
Calls me asking to make love
When this is changing humor
I know his breath, I know his smell
He calls me to de-e
And we do it again and again
Baby, I want to give it to you again and again
Calls me asking to make love
When this is changing humor
I know his breath, I know his smell

[Verse 1: Joyce Santana]
Ours an open secret
Those who know us know
I put it without coming
And I don't have to get a Pecocet, Yeh
He does not give you a rose and I have already given you as one hundred roses, Yeh
You are his wife but you prefer that it is me the one who sposes you
He calls me to de-e
He doesn't know where she left
Is with me again
And damn women with husband
Damn my taste for to 'the forbidden
And blessed be to 'what we and I have lived

[Chorus: Oken]
He calls me to de-e
And we do it again and again
Baby, I want to give it to you again and again
Calls me asking to make love
When this is changing humor
I know his breath, I know his smell

Of one, baby, I want to give it to you
IF I DO NOT THINK TAKE IT
He throws me if you want me to come back again
You have my number Marcalo
I have a pHillie's pair, your boyfriend is a trili
You have a problem forget it
With me you are chilling drinking Martini
The History with a photo in bikini
You have the guideline and notice is necessary
Is always high
Bastard body that highlights
Flexive as gymnasta
Baby, I'm already and you're well crazy
I don't know if it's the note
But I see everything HD
Meneame those buttocks'

[Chorus: Oken]
He calls me to de-e
And we do it again and again
Baby, I want to give it to you again and again
Calls me asking to make love
When this is changing humor
I know his breath, I know his smell
[Verse 3: brray]
(Brray)
You are aware of what he does
Just call for you
You are not mine I know
But after Rose
Even the Virgin Mary gets fucking Jose
And a relationship of three, I calm your stress
I put you right naps to revez
You need love and I will give you
Pa 'to return again
In that fishbowl I will make a fish
And if you don't believe it
When I finish 'take care of the floor and do not fall
If the work passes you I do you
Tell him that I'm narco
Because if they find out that the ship sinks us
I'm not pa 'embarrass
I am to give you this bug if you want to framed you
Enjoy it because I soon get the puddle

[Outro]
OK in
