Whole Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you remember where we started
Before we lost our innocence?
Never thought about tomorrow
On the run, chasing the sun
I never thought it could be over
So many things I never said
Another day, another sorrow
I'm okay

[Chorus]
But I, I just wish that you were here right now
Yeah I, I just wish that you would know by now
How much you mean to me
In a moment under all our tears, and all our memories
So, I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again
[Drop]
To make me whole again
Make me whole again
Make me whole again
So, I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again

[Verse 2]
No, I don't know how it happened
I woke up, and you were gone
I wondered, was it all a dream?
You and I, chasing the sun
And now I'm feeling California
While I'm trippin' in the dark
Another night, I still miss ya
It's alright

[Chorus]
But I, I just wish that you were here right now
Yeah I, I just wish that you would know by now
How much you mean to me
In a moment under all our tears, and all our memories
So, I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again

[Drop]
So, I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again
Make me whole again
Make me whole again
So, I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole againYou might also likeEmbed
