Party Talk LyricsEvery night's the same
All my friends are here to celebrate
I don't look for love, that's enough
Don't want to start this party talk

And there you are what's your name?
Please tell me who you are
Is this new? cause I'm falling for you
This better not be party talk

Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
Oh my darling girl
Let's talk about your life in this empty world
You left your friends at home
You know you are alone

And here we are hand in hand now
I know who you are
Is this new? Cause I'm falling for you
This better not be party talk

Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for youYou might also like2Embed
