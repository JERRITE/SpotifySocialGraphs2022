TranslationsTürkçeFrançaisReminds Me Of You Lyrics[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I know we can't be together ever again
You told me this forever, I ain't know forever could end
You had me fucked up, had me thinkin' I would die here for you
Shit got me fucked up, can't believe I was so blinded by you
But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I could die
Maybe if it was all over, I could have you in another life
[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Gotta step out, get some fresh air
Posted in the club, saw you pull up with your rebound
Remind me again, uh, who kicked who out whose house?
Remind me again, uh, who's fuckin' on who now? (Oh)
Fightin' for my heart and baby, I never lose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you
[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
Fightin' for my heart and baby, I never lose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you
