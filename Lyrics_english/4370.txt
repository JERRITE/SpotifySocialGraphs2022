If I'm easy lyrics [if I'm easy "]

[Intro: Héctor "El Father" & Tito "El Bambino"]
Ah-ah
Héctor and Tito
Luny Tunes and Noriega
I will give you more candle

[Chorus: Tito "El Bambino"]
If I'm easy, you grope
If I get more difficult, you regret
But you know that your body torments me
And when I take you
I will give you more candle
If I'm easy, you grope
If I get more difficult, you regret
But you know that your body torments me
And when I take you
I will give you more candle
If I'm easy, you grope
If I get more difficult, you regret
But you know that your body torments me
And when I take you
I will give you more candle
[Post-Coro: Tito "El Bambino"]
Ah
I will give you more candle
Ah
I will give you more candle
Ah
I will give you more candle

[Verse 1: Héctor "El Father"]
That they dance the 'thugs', no 'fuimo' to the garet
"El Bambino" arrives, the one that makes him
If it is 'restless, do not' get you
If you are shy to promise '
And if I am half bald, you ere 'a drawer
If you don't have 'permission I put the marbete
I run with the account and give you the freight
If you ere 'La Potrera, I am the rider
That they dance the 'thugs', no 'fuimo' to the garet

[Verse 2: Héctor "El Father"]
That I walk with the buster and the 'mozalbete'
Pégate and do not border on it ', that you will give you it
I give you under word if you have 'grillete
Go and look for your 'friends if they submit
That I am in the BM with my 'mozalbete'
The fine caco arrives, the one who does not promise
If you are helpless look for the 'motete'
That today I am very easy and with capable
And I have more 'diphthong' that the book 'e Petete
