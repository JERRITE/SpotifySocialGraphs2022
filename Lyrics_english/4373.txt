Kisses on the mouth Lyrics when a drop of rain touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
When a rain drop touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
Kiss me your mouth that your quate arrived
Your Gatecito, the one of the Kills
That rookie want them to kill them
Is shitting off the boat
So they dance to 'the cats that the most dog arrived
Hey, 'Toy loose looking for a burial
If you embed you, mommy, I emperor
That they alk their hands to 'the one who is a great dog
I kiss your mouth, your heart beats you
I kiss your neck, ask that you kill you
Your maid if it is emerging
I'm still, mommy, the fourth bat
Kiss me your mouth, get off the neckline
Your little boyfriend or what cocorote
Is looking for Looney to roof
Do not put goats that blow
I walk alone, mommy
You walk alone
If I hit you outsoursors you
And to 'these gangsters who controls them
(Boys! Come Pal Perreo, keep the guns!)

When a rain drop touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
When a rain drop touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
If you try me, you play alone
And your boyfriend, Mr. Carambolas
This is natural, no rola is needed
Guarantees', this is not Pangola
Stuck very strong to feel the Nolas
If your boyfriend fantasizes, that if he brings tail
Alla Va el Boster, the chola leaves
And leaves you throw there in Tortola
I apologize mother -in -law, I present myself, "Hello!"
I am not evil, I do not use guns
How is your daughter Carola
Looney, rose the rhythm, fuck the console
Looney, rose the rhythm, fuck the console
Guarantees', this is not Pangola
Looney, rose the rhythm, fuck the console
This is natural, no rola is needed

When a rain drop touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
When a rain drop touches me
The magic I feel here causes me
It's tenting me
I get drunk
It burns me, aloca me
The kiss left in your mouth
Dogs, quiet that brings tail
Come on Pal Perreo, keep the guns!
Dogs, quiet that brings tail
Come on Pal Perreo, keep the guns!
Dogs, quiet that brings tail
Come on Pal Perreo, keep the guns!
Dogs, quiet that brings tail
Looney, rose the rhythm, fuck the console !! embed
