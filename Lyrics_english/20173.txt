M1SERY_SYNDROME Lyrics[Verse 1: nothing,nowhere.]
Eyes open, blinding lights, my limbs are frozen
The sirens echo through the city streets tonight
They're microdosing empathy
To get me through the surgery
They're harvesting my arteries
You've taken every part of me

[Chorus: nothing,nowhere.]
Doctor, help me
Tell me, am I breathing?
I can't tell if I'm awake or dreaming
On the stretcher (And I slip away)
Is it better (If I drift away)
Doctor, help me
Tell me, am I breathing?
(Sometimes it's hard to tell)
[Verse 2: nothing,nowhere. and Buddy Nielsen, Buddy Nielsen]
Take, take the love right from my lungs
They can't operate, need to amputate
So wait, wait and watch me start to bleed
You played your part and I paid the price
They're microdosing empathy
To get me through the surgery
They're harvesting my arteries
You've taken every part of me

[Chorus: nothing,nowhere.]
Doctor, help me
Tell me, am I breathing?
I can't tell if I'm awake or dreaming
On the stretcher (And I slip away)
Is it better (If I drift away)
Doctor, help me
Tell me, am I breathing?
(Sometimes it's hard to tell)

[Outro: nothing,nowhere.]
Well, you look like love and you taste like pain
And you're all I want but it's not the same
When the heartbeat fades, I'll be on the table
So lacerate my chestYou might also like1Embed
