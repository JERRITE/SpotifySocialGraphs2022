It is better like this [row - live version] lyricsssi out for you, you would do me 
 Suffering almost without thinking you could lie 
 If I never, your love story 
 Do not play with me, your goodbye is better 

 Maybe this is the best 
 What to suffer from love 
 I don't do it for you, I don't want to continue 

 I don't want anything anymore 
 I can't believe you anything 
 Go and look for who loves you 
 Who holds you in your way 
 For my part it is lost 
 I have left you in oblivion 
 So tired I'm from you 
 It is better like that, it is better like that 
 You can't fight the truth 
 As much as you cry 
 I'm not going to change 

 Maybe this is the best 
 What to suffer from love 
 I don't do it for you 
 I do not want to continue 

 And although tonight I'm awake 
 I can tell you that I feel 
 Better like this, better, better like that 

 I don't want anything anymore 
 I can't believe you anything 
 Go and look for who loves you 
 Who holds you in your way 
 For my part it is lost 
 I have left you in oblivion 
 So tired I'm from you 
 It's better like that, go, it's better like this Iou Might Also Likeembed
