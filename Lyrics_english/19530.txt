Cannot Stop Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin Stone]
Stay in your lane
Yeah, we get it little homie, you've been gettin' some brain
Rappin' 'bout how you smokin' weed like a chain
But I've gotta be the one to throw the industry shade (Yeah)
Told you I've been fed up, get your bread up, you don't drop shit
Droppin' so much fire 2018, it's obnoxious
Put me on a sixteen, watch the numbers rise
Just went from the bubble to the top
LOL, tell me that I lost it (Lost it)
Low key love it when they talk shit (Talk shit)
High key working with the O.G.s
Same artists that I was always watchin'
Crazy I be livin' out my dreams
Only two years ago I came up on the scene (Yeah-yeah)
Sleeping through the day but I'm workin' like a fiend
Yeah, she need me when I'm here and she need me when I leave, like
[Chorus: Justin Stone]
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
You cannot, you cannot, you cannot, you cannot stop me

[Verse 2: Justin Stone]
Ayy, no more ballin' on a budget (No-no)
Never been top 40, man I'm underground (Oh yeah)
Right from the sunrise
Finna blow up by the time that the sun goes down, yeah (Word)
Show you that I run it
Lately I've been on the low, we should make some ruckus, yeah
Old girls gonna want this but I turn them all down
Off the market like I'm sold out
Fans form a line for my shows when it's cold out (Cold out)
Wish I knew then what I know now (Know now)
Wouldn't have stress, wouldn't care about a view
Screwed up at 21, finna grow at 22 (Yeah)
From a dollar and a dream, built that shit
Promise every single single fantastic
Put the city on my back
Got the type of flow to make the whole city do a backflip
You might also like[Chorus: Justin Stone]
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
You cannot, you cannot, you cannot, you cannot stop me

[Verse 3: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, yeah, oye no puedo parar (Woo)
Enemigos yo quiero matar (Brr)
I hear all the bragging 'bout money you grab
It looks like no puedes pagar (Nah nah)
Yeah, I see everybody wanna emulate
How I'm livin' even women that I penetrate
I'm a degenerate but look at what I generate (Yeah)
Never be takin' a break until there's millies when I end a chase
Venezuela to America, loose cannon
Back home, women be winnin' all of the beauty pageants (Yeah)
You can get it again, want it then you have it (Woo)
After the summer is finished I need a new passport
Due France new fashion Louvre passes (Louvre passes)
Fuck all that clothes, I got a few bags
And now I live in L.A., the view massive (View massive)
And this year my taxes will hit a new bracket
Rrrrrrrrah
[Chorus: Justin Stone]
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
They told me they like when I get cocky
Ain't it funny how they think they can stop me
Try to be me but I'm so sorry, you not me
You cannot, you cannot, you cannot, you cannot stop me1Embed
