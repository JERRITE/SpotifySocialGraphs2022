And you are made, they tell me that you are short of me.
Vamo 'pa' Las Vegas to beautiful in Venetian (haha)

After they eat them, block them and despise them
And take alone in the boat and money in the tube

Ice on the neck, bastard, I don't turn
An angel in law, the devil in the left -handed

That back 'of' a movie that does not have it or netflix
Nalgona, does not fail in the diet and has more 'curve' that Pepsi's logo
A private album that only uses it to 'record video' and photo '
My room looks like a hotel, under the fry like that—
In Palomin, running Jet Ski
That in P.R. E 'obliges or marks the bikini
The molasses is not of the, it is from here
TMA, give yourself a hit, after I do not want to go

And that he gives to the grass
And the leg 'van pa' above as if it were an assault
