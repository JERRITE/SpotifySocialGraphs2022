Half Crazy Remix Lyrics [Letter of "Media Crazy Remix" FT. Rusherking, FMK & Juhn]

[Intro: nobeat & fmk]
Yeah, Nobeat
This is the remix
Soft, ey, how I like your gaze
Soft, ey, like the perfume of your skin
Soft, ey, tonight I left the street, mommy, thinking of finding you, hey
And there I found you, Yeah, Baby (Yah!)

[Chorus: nobeat & juhn]
You are like half crazy, but better than many out there
What to delight how Bailas, Bam-Bam-Bam, the booty makes you like that (Yah; Skrrt-Skrrt)
You are like half crazy, but better than many out there (Yeah; Auh!)
What to delight how Bailas, Bam-Bam-Bam (Juhn "The All Star", Baby) tell me
[Verse 1: juhn & rusherking]
Baby, you are half crazy (Wuh), but I like it, like you (like you)
That in bed they dance (hahaha)
It has no coward
Bandida, may God keep you
From your body I always have craving (-tojo)
And when kissing those lips very red '(red')
Like a little baby I blushed me
When I see you and when I take you (oh)
Echamo 'more than one dust that does not go' and house (yah)
I gave him twenty thousand to go and spend it in place
It gets more flirtatious if I put it to smoke molasses (ah)
And he tells me that it is already late, that nobody replaces me (OH-OH-OH)

[Verse 2: rusherking & noatat]
Bottle
Owner
Pa 'you at any time
My weakness, my tranquility
Mommy, whenever drunk I see you again
Time stops me
I like you and I don't know what to do (ah-ah)
Because I know that it does not suit me
That you are crazy for me, you don't let me out
Problem, leaves me without chance
But I like that, that's why I'm still here (oh, ay, ay)
What she wants at her reach (Yeah, Yeah-Yeah, Yeah-Yeah; Yah!)

[Verse 3: khea]
It's crazy but Snap doesn't send me (Snapchat)
Now I have it dancing as Addison Rae (RAE)
It became my favorite snack (Wuh)
When stressed, I am your spa (your spa)
Whenever I fall (I fall)
I find it like Michael (Michael)
She and 'half psycho and does what he wants (he does what he wants)
With that booty I distract me, know what he has
All natural (natural), it seems that they made you pa 'me (pa' me)
Not stopped 'to talk since I met you (which I met you)
As Ester Expósito, you ere 'elite
Everything 'wants to throw you but are Mr. Bean (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

And give it, move it, olive
You have 'poder', so use it '
Baby, excuse 'no, please
Trying to understand you graduated, because
[Verse 4: FMK]
You Ere 'Media Crazy, Media Loca
Of those who do not apologize or when they are wrong
Tonight you took off your clothes
Knowing, mommy, that causes me
And you ere 'the unconditional
The street comes out without wanting to return
If you leave for the bresh, I can go looking for you
I know so much about you, but I never knew how to speak
For you I bite the apple like Eva with Adam (OH)
The night was dark, there was nothing to clarify (no)
Do not think the same (no), you can relax (Yeah)
That we start with the remix, you leave with FMK, EY (OH)

[Chorus: Khea & nobeat]

What to delight how Bailas, Bam-Bam-Bam (Yeah)

She doesn't play Call of Duty, but always kills me

Half crazy, it is not easy to understand it
It's like Baldor Algebra, Ey (Wuh)
Or if it were 'a meme I share (no)
You are not second dish
Baby, please (skrrt, skrrt), don't ask me about my ex, no, no
Do not invoke Voldemort, haha, Yeah
If you trust ', Baby, everything is simpler (Yah; Oh-Oh)
The others do not worry me
I apartment and turn them off, like a cigarette (Skrrt-Skrrt-Skrrt)
