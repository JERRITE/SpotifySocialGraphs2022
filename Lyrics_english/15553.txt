Dressed in lyrics sugar [lyrics "dressed in sugar"]

[Verse 1]
I am so scared
To forget what I love you
And that, with the passage of time
Leave everything in memory
I am very afraid
I almost leave and I still dare
So much precaution that desire does not come
Taking care not to get hurt I stay with nothing
[Pre-Car 1]
I have planned in my mind
How to steal your kisses forever
It has to work
I'm going to love you so much that you will suddenly look crying

[Chorus]
I'm going to give you what I gave
Dressed in sugar, a sweet for you
I'm going to melt in the heat of my voice
I'll take your breath away and you will not tell me goodbye
Let me ask you what no one will
It does not matter what you think, I'll take the risk
And although I know that I take them to lose, I prefer to make a leap to the unknown
In an instant lived I will die or achieve it

[Verse 2]
I will no longer be cautious
Total, if you're leaving, leave me a smile
The memory can hurt
But I prefer not to even stay with that

[Pre-Coro 2]
I have planned in my mind
The perfect act to retain
I'm going to overcome my fear
Now you'll feel what I can cause when I want to

I'm going to give you what I gave
Dressed in sugar, a sweet for you
I'm going to melt in the heat of my voice
I'll take your breath away and you will not tell me goodbye
Let me ask you what no one will
It does not matter what you think, I'll take the risk
And although I know that I take them to lose, I prefer to make a leap to the unknown
In an instant lived I will die ... or I will do it

[Bridge]
Sugar crystals reflect the moon
Tears of relief show you ways
One step closer frost cracks
I do not tremble of fear but ... what I love you
(AAH-AAH, AAH, AAH)

[Chorus]
I'm going to give you what I gave
Dressed in sugar, a sweet for you
I'm going to melt in the heat of my voice
I'll take your breath away and you will not tell me goodbye
Let me ask you what no one will
It does not matter what you think, I'll take the risk
And although I know that I carry them to lose
I prefer to make a leap to the unknown
In an instant lived I will die ... or I will do it
[Outro]
I will achieve it
