Better with You (Kastra & Twodb Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I was messed up
But I hope you will forget
Please do me a favor
Erase the things I said
Pull me a little closer
Take away the pain
Remind me I got everything to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you

[Verse 2]
Laying by your bedside
You feel so far away
Guess my quota's full now
Go ahead, make a mistake
You'll say that you're sorry
And I'll say it's okay
'Cause I know I got everything to lose

[Hook]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
You'll say that you're sorry
And I'll say it's okay
'Cause I know I got everything to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with youEmbed
