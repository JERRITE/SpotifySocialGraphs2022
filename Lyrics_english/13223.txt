Good Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dawn breaks overhead
I'm not the girl you thought I was
But I am close, close enough
Was it something that I said
Is it the way I stood so still and never moved
Now every dirty dish is in a mood
And so are you

[Pre-Chorus]
He's not on our side, but I could save you if you'd like
Just let me in there, past that high chair
And I will dwell in every crane I see
The holo pleasures spoke to me
Like someone's gonna preach once I am gone
I want to believe that you've got a good heart, oh oh-oh
Oh I want to believe that you've got a good heart, oh oh-oh
[Chorus]
Oh I want to believe that you've got a good heart, oh oh-oh
Oh I want to believe that you've got a good heart, oh oh-oh
Oh I want to believe in some things I happen to read on the inside of fortune cookies
I want to say no when I'm offered a hit and it ruins my weekend
I'm nothing but trouble, watching you sleep
Brushing your teeth and laughing at me
I'm nothing but trouble, baby believe in meYou might also likeEmbed
