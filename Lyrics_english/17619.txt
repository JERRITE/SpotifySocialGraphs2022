Okay Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I couldn't stand in a room with you
And not think about that night
I had to cross the street if we were walking on the same side
It just hurt too much
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

[Verse 2]
I had to block you on instagram
So I wouldn't feel impatient
I had to stop myself at least once a day
From thinking how her haircut makes us look the same and
It hurt a bunch
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again
[Chorus]
I've been taking my time not trying to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

[Verse 3]
We had a party at our place
And you showed up with your best friends
It wasn't weird it wasn't awkward
It was just like seeing an old friend

[Bridge]
After four whole months
I don't remember ever seeing you so happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us
It's been four whole months
I don't remember ever being this happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us

[Chorus
I've been taking my time trying not to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay againYou might also like1Embed
