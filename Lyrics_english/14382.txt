Up to No Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to be the one to tell you that the world is broke
But you're so innocent you cannot separate fire from the smoke
Words drip like honey dear, how sweet it is to hear
But not everything you are presented is as it appears

[Pre-Chorus]
So he tells you he loves you now
Driving you crazy how, fingers on lips
Allow his hands to your hips
You know you shouldn't do this
[Chorus]
Oh, you think he's looking lovingly at you
But itâ€™s nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head
Not a second thought about you
Oh

[Verse 2]
Don't get too comfortable with the man who has no history
Shadows climbing walls hide cracks we don't want other eyes to see
You tell me to shut my mouth, you love the mystery

[Pre-Chorus]
So he tells you he loves you now
Driving you crazy how, fingers on lips
Allow his hands to your hips
You know you shouldn't do this
There's no turning back

[Chorus]
Oh, you think he's looking lovingly at you
But it's nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head
Not a second thought about you
Oh, you think he's looking lovingly at you
But it's nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head
Not a second thought about you
You might also like[Outro]
Oh
There's no turning back
Oh
There's no turning back
