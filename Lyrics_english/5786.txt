Hundred Mile High City Lyrics[Verse 1]
So I said I'm on the roam so I need a car
And I know that I'm getting alive
And I say I got faith and a season
And I say that's where I'm going to

[Chorus]
I get a need and I'm wanting to please it
I gotta face and I'm wanting to feel it
The more I feel is the more that I need it
The more I need is the less I believe it
[Verse 2]
Well I want a good love by my side
Keep on getting out of love and my pride
And I know I keep hurting my love yeah
But I know it ain't killing

[Chorus]
I get a need and I'm wanting to please it
I gotta face and I'm wanting to feel it
The more I feel is the more that I need it
The more I need is the less I believe it

[Bridge]

[Guitar Break]

[Verse 1]
So I said I'm on the roam so I need a car
And I know that I'm staying alive
And I know that my faith is in season
And I say that's where I'm going to

[Chorus]
I get a need and I'm wanting to please it
I gotta face and I'm wanting to feel it
The more I feel is the more that I need it
The more I need is the less I believe it

I gotta face and I'm wanting to feel it
The more I feel is the more that I need it
The more I need is the less I believe itEmbed
