All my love lyrics [lyrics of "all my love"]

[Verse 1]
When you feel hot without knowing why
Is that someone from afar on you, believe me
When you sleep in your bed and a flame burned you
Someone looks for you

[Verse 2]
I love you in the distance, hung from my stress
Between seas and cities, I look for you where you are
I don't know your name very well or where I will see you
I want, I want
[Chorus]
I want you to love me as I am
I want you to love me because yes
A palace in space, only for you
I dream that you dream of me in color
Living and devivating you for me
For you, all my love, all my love

[Verse 3]
I look for your initial streets, your gaze on paper
And I call you and claim you, where are you? Answer me
I don't know anything about your body, or your eyes, or your lips, or your skin
I want, I want

[Chorus]
I want you to love me as I am
I want you to love me because yes
A palace in space, only for you
I dream that you dream of me in color
Living and devivating you for me
For you, all my love, all my love

[Bridge]
You know I don't lie, this is what I feel
For you, all my love
(I wanna)

[Chorus]

(I want you to love me because yes) how am I
(A palace in space, only for you) only for you
