For Your Entertainment Lyrics[Verse 1]
So hot, out the box
Can you pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up, I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it?
Baby, don't be afraid
I'ma hurt you real good, baby
Let's go, it's my show
Baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz that I'm gonna display
I told ya I'm a hold you down until you're amazed
Give it to you till you're screamin' my name
[Pre-Chorus]
No escaping when I start
Once I'm in, I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

[Chorus 1]
Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

[Verse 2]
It's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, I'm in control
Take the pain, take the pleasure
I'm the master of both
Close your eyes, not your mind
Let me into your soul
I'm a work it till you're totally blown
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No escaping when I start
Once I'm in, I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

[Chorus 1]
Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Entertainment
Oh oh... oh entertainment
I'm here for your entertainment
Ohh
Do you like what you see?
Whoa
Let me entertain you till you scream
[Chorus 1]
Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm about to do?
'Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
But I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment8Embed
