Feeling So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
I like my alarm, it doesn't bother me to hear it going off
Wake up each morning, and the whole world opens up
Opens up for the taking
Man, this shit is amazing, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
Haven't felt like this for a while now
Think I finally got this figured out

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm feeling so good, feeling so good, feeling so good
Feeling so good, feeling so good, I've been feeling so good
[Post-Chorus]
Good
Feeling so good
Good
Good, good, feeling so...
Feeling

[Verse 2]
Clouds don't ever last, wait for the sun to come
The past is just the past, and once it's done, it's done
No point in looking back
There's no time to be wasted
Here and now is amazing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Haven't felt like this for a while now
Think I finally got this figured out
I can see the light much better now
And I'm feeling so good
Feeling so good, I've been feeling so good

[Chorus]
Feeling so good, feeling so good, feeling so good
Feeling so good, feeling so good, I've been feeling so good

[Post-Chorus]
Good
Feeling so good
Good
Good, good, feeling so...
Feeling

Feeling so good, feeling so good, I've been feeling so good
