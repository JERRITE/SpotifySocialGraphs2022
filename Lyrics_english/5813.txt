[Verse 1: Buju Banton & DJ Khaled]
Right through the gates of hell
Where that wretched soul that live a life of evil, out of control
Tormented soul, tormented soul, go away
Go away, go away from me
Take them away, Father, take them away, oooi
Right through the gates of Hell
With powers over darkness and light
Hypocrites and jezebels dance to the Devil’s delight
They made a pact, they made a pact, ooh
Bloody sacrifice
How they kill, name and torture and use the name of Christ
(Another one) I turn them away

My blessings, my blessings
Gotta protect (Gotta protect)
