That Lyricstu kiss you say no
That hallucino, which are my things
You tell me that I am not the same
That over time I have changed

And I swear I am an expert
In turning black into black
Truths in lies
You say that you have not changed
I am the one who imagines
But no, but no, my love
Whoever denies your eyes
MANY LIVES ME YOUR VOICE

But that kiss said everything
He told me that someone else has fallen in love
That you no longer love me, that everything ends

But that kiss said everything
Your words help you lie
Your mind strives to hide
But your mouth betrayed you

You don't ask forgiveness
You hold on to be nonsense
You insist that no
I am hallucinating

And I don't see you
When your fingers tremble
Every time you caress me
But it costs you so much to say that you are mine

But no, but no, my love
Whoever denies your eyes
MANY LIVES ME YOUR VOICE
You might also like that kiss said everything
He told me that someone else has fallen in love
That you no longer love me, that everything ends

But that kiss said everything
Your words help you lie
Your mind strives to hide
But your mouth betrayed you

There's nothing left
Neither in your hands, nor in your body
Of that love that unioles us both
You don't have to pretend

But that kiss, he said everything

But that kiss said everything
Your words help you lie
Your mind strives to hide
But your mouth betrayed you

But your mouth betrayed me
