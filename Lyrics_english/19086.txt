Neither Gucci nor Prada Lyrics [letter of "nor Gucci nor Prada"]

[Intro]
New Beginning

[Verse 1]
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada, Fendi or Louis Vuitton
Jacuzzi does not care, alms or mansion
You thought that with all the silver you would have your heart
But with sweet letters I take it to my armchair
[Pre-car]
And that I don't have a weight
But she doesn't care about that
When kissing me
She gives me effortless
And that I don't have a weight
But she doesn't care about that
When kissing me
She gives me effortless, Galán, Galán

[Chorus]
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come
I make me come to me, pa'cá
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come
I make me come to me pa'cá

[Verse 2]
I can't pay for champagne, Buchanan or Moët & Chandon
I can give it tequila, cold beer and a good rum
I can't take it for Spain, Pa 'Italia or Pa' New York
I take her to the moon when he made 'love
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
And that I don't have a dollar
But that doesn't even bother
When you leave it alone
She takes me for her bedroom
And that I don't have a dollar
But that doesn't even bother
When you leave it alone
She takes me for her bedroom, Galán, Galán

[Chorus]
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come
I make me come to me, pa'cá
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come
I make me come to me pa'cá

[Bridge]
Without money she loves me
He doesn't care that he has nothing, nothing, nothing
I am the buay that she prefers
She looks for me even if I have nothing, nothing, nothing more
[Saying]
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada
Gucci ni, Gucci ni, Gucci or Prada
Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada
Gucci ni, Gucci ni, Gucci
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada
Gucci ni, Gucci ni, Gucci or Prada
Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada
Gucci ni, Gucci ni, Gucci or Prada
