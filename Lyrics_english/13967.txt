Want You So Bad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Quicken up
C'mon, bite the hand that feeds you
It's what I do
But you know somebody needs you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, how does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel?

[Chorus]
I want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh, I want you so bad
Don't care for what I got or what I am
'Cause I want you
Want you so bad
[Verse 2]
Moving on, your abandon is so casual
So dress it up, 'cause it's a lot for me to handle
Breaststroke in aftershave ocean
Get our petrol in motion
Shaking your head with dissatisfaction
Living in hope for the best reaction

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, just like before
Oh, but more and more

[Chorus]
I want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh, I want you so bad
Don't care for what I got or what I am
'Cause I want you
Want you so bad

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Cause I want you so bad
Want you so bad
Oh, I want you so bad
Don't care for what I got or what I am
Cause I want you
Want you so badYou might also like3Embed
