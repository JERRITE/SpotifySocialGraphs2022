Wilmaâ€™s Rainbow LyricsYou heard about, "Be your own man."
You talk a lot and loud
Illustrate the obvious, boy
You're mentally endowed

Watershed year comes
You're flush with fever
The richest junk dealer

Honestly, a book you read once
Let you think in rhymes
The old extreme sits pale and molds
Now for the millionth time
Wilma's rainbow of peaceful colors
The richest junk dealer

Wilma's rainbow of peaceful colors
The richest junk dealerYou might also likeEmbed
