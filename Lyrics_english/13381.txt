Tremors Lyrics[Intro]
Vibrations of tremors that shook long ago
Tear holes in the fabric of all that we know

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't survive with the secrets we have
All that we have is a lie
Hold the line
'Til the thread comes undone
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
[Chorus]
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go...

[Verse]
Bloodlines we etched when we merged into one
Rewind and scar long before they were done

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't survive with the secrets we share
If all that we share is a lie
Hold the line
Let the thread come undone
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do

[Chorus]
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go...
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do
(If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do)
If you're thinking of letting me go then it's time that you do

[Outro]
