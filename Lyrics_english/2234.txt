Dancing Next To Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Twenty-two, he doesn't drink but he needs to let loose
He doesn't know what he wants, but I do
And I give into the moment
Hmm, hey
Hold tight, says he wants to come over
And I'll try, I'll try to keep my composure
But I might say something that I mean, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the last thing I remember
The first thing that I saw
I thought you had surrendered
And you don't pick up my calls
But I know that you felt it
And I felt it when you were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me
[Chorus]
Dancing next to me
Dancing next to me
Dancing next to me
You were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me

[Verse 2]
"Slow down," those aren't the words that I wanted
From your mouth
From your lips that I just kissed
One more shot, but I need to
One last touch, and I want you
You were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the last thing I remember
The first thing that I saw
I thought you had surrendered
And you don't pick up my calls
And I know that you felt it
And I felt it when you were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me

[Chorus]
Dancing next to me
Dancing next to me
Dancing next to me
You were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me

I was yours for the weekend
Come sunrise, it's time for you to dodge your feelings
Call your girl to deny
We know is the truth
You were who you wanted to be
When you were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me

[Chorus]
Yeah, dancing next to me
Yeah, you were dancing next to me
Yeah, you were dancing next to me
You were there, you were there
You were dancing next to me
(Yeah, you were dancing next to me)Embed
