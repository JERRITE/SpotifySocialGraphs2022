Txtinâ€™ Lyrics[Intro: Haile]
Ooh
In my zone, yeh yeh, yay
You decide
You decide
Only you decide

[Chorus: Haile]
Txtin', txtin', txtin'
Jugglin' me all over your phone all night (Nah, nah, nah)
It's your love you're jugglin' me
You don't know that you been all mine (Nah, nah, nah)
I'm the only one you wanted (Nah, nah, nah)
I can follow where your heart is
All night 'till the morning
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah, nah)
[Bridge: Haile]
We got about three hours, leave your phone alone
He be guessing what goes down, when we be all alone

[Verse 1: Louis Rei]
So we flexin, flexin, flexin, come from the WSTRN
Tell him stop txtin', txtin, troubling you
I'm fly, he's on the pest ting
Interesting, money haffi double cah we spending
Stepped in, bowling like the 10-pin
Groovy, moving how I spend it, peng ting named Maddison
But I want the bredrin
Nah, nah, now
I'm paranoid, I gots to pat it down
I'm Beenie Man like zaga zow
I said I been the man like zaga zow, zaga zow

[Chorus: Haile]
Txtin', txtin', txtin'
Jugglin' me all over your phone all night (Nah, nah, nah)
It's your love you're jugglin' me
You don't know that you been all mine (Nah, nah, nah)
I'm the only one you wanted (Nah, nah, nah)
I can follow where your heart is
All night 'till the morning
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah, nah)

[Verse 2: Alkaline]
Million phone light every time me go live on stage, that's the way me live
But no txtin', matter of fact, no phones allowed from you come inna mi crib
Me ah cut to the chase and go straight to the biz
Kiss you pon yuh neck, yeah, me ah gi yuh some hickies
We can have a party, baby, we can have a party
Make you blow out the candles, and then you make your wishes
Know you have your man, but guess what, something haffi give
We can work it out as best as possible, ya dig?
We can have a party, anything you want fi call it
And we nuh haffi call it 'cheating', use anedda adjective

He be guessing what goes down, when we be all alone

[Verse 3: Akele]
He's been calling your phone
He doesn't know that you're mine
Now I'm all in your hole
'Cause he never gave you no time
I swear alone all night
Why he be on the phone all night
Too bad she don't want you
Ho, homie why you mad, I gone through her
Still banging off a phone like a loser
When you should be banging on the roads with a shooter
I let him know that I got her on a cheating
Txtin', txtin her while we're sexin', sexin'

[Chorus: Haile]
Txtin', txtin', txtin'
Jugglin' me all over your phone all night (Nah, nah, nah)
It's your love you're jugglin' me
You don't know that you been all mine (Nah, nah, nah)
I'm the only one you wanted (Nah, nah, nah)
I can follow where your heart is
All night 'till the morning
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah (Nah, nah, nah)

[Outro: Haile]
We got about three hours, leave your phone alone
He be guessing what goes down, when we be all alone
We got about three hours, leave your phone alone
He be guessing what goes down, when we be all alone4Embed
