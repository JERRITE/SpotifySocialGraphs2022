From my eyes (remix) lyrics [lyrics by "from my eyes (remix)"]

[Enter: Chris Lebron & Sech]
(Flow Factory)
This is the remix
(Once 'more' me)

[Verse 1: sech]
My love and 'so great, nobody gets the measure
I looked for you on Google and it was' mine
The kisses that I send you, Baby, do not catch it even the police
And in this, as thong your friend '' t√°n put ', tell me
When and what does the moon under
I upload my skirt and put you back '? Eh eh)
If it is' with another, I take the long
I'm on my way, so tell him to come out
I would shut up your profile
But I have so much things to say (-te)
Like the other remix, mommy, you ere 'pa' me
And if I have to thank you, baby, and for existing, Yeh
[Pre-Caro: Chris LeBron]
If you saw yourself from my eyes, you would know why I insist so much
I don't care Instagram, I want to know about you when I get up, oh-oh-oh
Each ve 'that passes a second, and you are not, I drowned in crying (no-no-not)
Come, give me a relief, ma, and let me go from this breakdown

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler]
And now I close my eyes, and you are you
And I look at the sky, and you are you
I remember something nice, and you are
Give me the Spirit
I close my eyes, and you are you
And I look at the sky, and you are you
Invading my mind you
Return the spirit (Yah)

[Verse 2: Chris LeBron]
When will I see you again? (Hey!)
And I want to make me know (no-no)
When I deserved to lose you
They are crying for years
I miss your kiss' in the early morning
Your love in exchange for nothing
The love in every look
Your smile in my tattooed soul
How do I ask you to come back '? (Let it come back ')
Your love has me against the rope '
Tell me if e 'what in true' does not remember '
Do not make it lost to the desert, eh-yeh
Come, give me a relief to 'get late, ma
Because my bed does not resist another tear

And now I close my eyes, and you are you
I look at the sky, and you are you
I remember something beautiful, and you are (huh, oh!)
Give me the Spirit
I close my eyes, and you are you
I look at the sky, and you are you
Invading my mind you
Return the spirit, na, na-na

[Verse 3: Jay Wheeler]
Baby, if you call me, 'it came flying as Mora says, huh
It has spent a lot of time, but my heart does not improve
Yesterday I was guiding and put our song on the station
If you saw my eyes, I'm sure you understood
I would have wanted your kisses to be like the gifts'
That although you left a lifetime
I want to have you and you so cold, still
With you and what do I want to do well
If it does not ere 'you, then, there is no one with whom

[Pre-Caro: Chris LeBron]
If you saw yourself from my eyes, you would know why I insist so much
I don't care Instagram, I want to know about you when I get up, oh-oh-oh
Each ve 'that passes a second, and you are not, I drowned in crying (no-no-not)
Come, give me a relief, ma, and let me go from this breakdown
[Chorus: Chris LeBron]
Now I close my eyes, and you are you
And I look at the sky, and you are you
I remember something nice, and you are
Give me the Spirit
I close my eyes, and you are you, no, oh
