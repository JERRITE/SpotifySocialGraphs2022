Overnight Sensation Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sun is falling down outside the city walls
She's glowin' like the cherry on my cigarette
Beads of sweat are diamonds drippin' down her neck
I cannot take my eyes off her silhouette

[Chorus]
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation
[Verse 2]
You look like that you should be a centerfold
But I'm talking Playboy 1974
Sure don't make them like you anymore
Read between your tan lines, forevermore

[Chorus]
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation

[Bridge]
The sun is risin' up outside this balcony
She's bloomin' like a flower laying next to me

[Chorus]
Immaculate creation
Overnight sensation
God, you really outdid yourself with this one
She's an overnight sensation, yeah
(Oh yeah, you are)
(Ooh)
(Yeah, you are)You might also like3Embed
