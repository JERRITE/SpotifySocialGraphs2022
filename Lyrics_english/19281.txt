Off-White Lyrics[Intro: Global Dan]
Yeah, ayy
Sauce!

[Chorus: Global Dan]
I just pulled up in L.A., wearin' Off-White
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like

[Verse 1: Globan Dan]
Yeah, I see that brand new Benz from a distance
I don't know you, we not friends, keep your distance
I don't really fuck with them, they be trippin'
Keep a .38 inside my Scottie Pippens
Drinkin' that lean like it's coffee, ooh (Syrup)
I feel like nothin' can stop me, ooh
All these thotties they be sloppy
Wanna run up on me, hit 'em like Rocky, damn
Now I'm feelin' like Chris, ayy
Diamonds dancin' on my wrist, ayy
Diamonds dancin' like Rihanna
Coolin' with Chapo, I'll see you ma√±ana
Trapping inside the cabana
Tony Montana, flippin' that work for the Prada
I just want all of the money, fuck up some commas
I got no time for no drama
Coolin' with Mongo, we makin' a movie, your mama
Prolly somewhere in Bahamas
[Chorus: Global Dan]
I just pulled up in L.A., wearin' Off-White
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like

[Verse 2: Mongo]
They don't wanna see me shine 'cause my light bright
Wake up in the mornin' high like a damn kite
If we beef, no politickin', holmes, it's on sight
I just wanna fuck you baby, why you wanna fight?
I just copped a P, bands 'bout to take flight
See me with the hands, I'm posted up all night
Comin' live from the 5, 12 years strong
Honeycomb Perc, bottom of my big bong
You don't wanna play chicken, I got big balls
Ten toes down, big boss, stand tall
I've been cookin' so hard, sauce on the wall
I'm makin' hits, that's your bitch 'bout to risk it all
What's the move? Hit me up, I stay on call
In shinin' shoes, dressin' up like I'm 'bout to ball
Makin' plays, silky smooth, John fucking Wall
They so fake and I'm so true, I'm tryna tell y'all
Get it how you live it, make sure you just don't fall
It's all about the digits, get it then I make a call
I just wanna be rich and buy the fuckin' mall
I got tunnel vision like I'm walkin' in a hall

I just pulled up in L.A., wearin' Off-White
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like7Embed
