Fossil Medley: I’ll Be Doggone / Try It Baby / Can I Get A Witness / You’re A Wonderful One / Stubborn Kind Of Fellow / How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) (Live 1974) Lyrics[Intro]
Alright, just stay with me, baby
Clap your hands, that'll help me out right
All right, I'm gon' be with you, baby
Just stay with me
I wanna sing a medley of my hit songs for you
I wanna see if you remember some of these old songs

[I'll Be Doggone]

[Verse]
I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day, ah baby
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
Oh no, baby, thank you
But if I caught you running around and
Blowing my money all over this town
[Chorus]
I, woo, be doggone
I'd be long, oh, long gone, baby
Wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long, oh, long gone
Let's move on up now
Alright, we're doing good now
This is it

[Try It Baby]

[Verse]
And now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Girl, you're doing just fine, fine, fine

[Chorus]
But take away your good looks
And all, all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just
Try it, baby
Try it, baby
Try it, baby
Try it, darlin'
You'll see
Nobody loves you but me, baby
Nobody loves you but me, darlin'
You might also like[Outro]
Yeah, we rollin' now, we rollin'
Keep it on up one time
I told you we got it, woo
All night, baby
Sure we're sure, all night, oh
Woo, well, Gene, I ain't count one off in a long time
Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene
Let me count this one off one time
Gene, here we go
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four

[Can I Get a Witness]

[Intro]
Woo, alright

[Verse]
Ah, listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
A woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair
[Chorus]
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I want a witness
Can I get a witness?
I want a witness
I want a witness

[Outro]
You've given everything you had
Even tossin' in my sleep
Oh, let it go, Gene
Let it run a while, Gene
Let it go right there, Gene
Gene, let it run right there
I wanna talk to one young lady in the audience

[You're a Wonderful One]

[Verse]
You are so wonderful
Being near you is all that I...
Come here, baby, come here, baby, you
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known, baby, I just wanna sing to her, my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever, I love you

[Chorus]
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one, oh

[Stubborn Kind of Fellow]

[Intro]
Say yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Oh baby, ooh, say yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Feel like it, you can sing

[Verse]
I try to put my arms around you
All because I wanna hold you tight
Every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got news for you
You know I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Say yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Ah little baby, yes, ah baby, say yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I see you, baby, I see you
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you
You, you

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you

[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]

[Intro]
Oh darling, how sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes it is, baby
In the back there

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms, oh, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And oh, there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I wanna stop, and thank you, baby
I wanna stop, and thank you, baby, woo

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, I mean it, baby, oh yes, you're so sweet
Woo-hoo, baby

[Verse 2]
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you, nobody else
I want to stop, I got to stop
Stop it, baby
Stop

[Interlude]
Oh, Lord have mercy
Wait a minute, ah, wait a minute
How sweet it is, woo, Lord have mercy
I've got to stop
How sweet it is, baby
I had to break the speed down right here where it's nice and groovy
I want the groove to lay right here
I want to talk to you, tell you how sweet it is, baby
Oh, it's so sweet, how sweet it is
Oh, it's so sweet, darlin', oh yes it is
Oh, it's so sweet
You know it's sweet
How sweet...
Wait a minute, I want everybody in the house to turn to the person sitting next to them and say 'how sweet it is'
That gentleman didn't like that, sir
How sweet it is, baby
Loving you every day
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You know, ladies and gentlemen, I got to take this time on this song to express to you my sincere thanks
I'm not leaving you
But this song, I have to tell you, I love you, you've been so good to me
I love you, how sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is
So sweet deep down inside my soul
Oh Lord, how sweet it is, woo, woo
Oh, how sweet it is loving you, baby
I think I've been gone a long time
I think I wanna tell you how sweet it is, baby
I wish I could come down there and talk to you, baby
I wish I could walk down and tell you how sweet it is
Oh, you're so good to me, how sweet it is loving you, baby
Oh Lord, yeah
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, Gene, Gene, Gene, I'm ready to go on
Tell 'em 'bout it, Gene
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, woo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo
How sweet it is to be loved by you, and you, and you
How sweet it is

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you very kindly, ladies and gentlemenEmbed
