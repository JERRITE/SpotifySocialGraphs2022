Neither Gucci nor Prada (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "nor Gucci nor Prada (Remix)" ft. Sebastián Yatra]

[Saying: Kenny Man & Sebastián Yatra]
Yatra, Yatra
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada (New Beginning)
Gucci, neither Gucci, nor Gucci nor Prada (Panama and Colombia)
Gucci or Prada, Gucci or Prada (Official Remix)
Gucci, neither Gucci, nor Gucci nor Prada (Kenny Man, Kenny Man)
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada
He wants Kenny Man or Yatra
Because for love you don't pay
[Pre-Caro: Sebastián Yatra & Kenny Man]
She does not want Gucci or Prada, Fendi or Louis Vuitton (neither Fendi nor Louis Vuitton)
He doesn't care about the jacuzzi, alms or mansion (what, if she has a mansion)
You thought that with all the silver you would have his heart (heart, heart, heart)
But with sweet letters I take it to my armchair (even if I don't have a thousand)

[Choir: Kenny Man, Sebastián Yatra & both]
And that I don't have a weight
But she doesn't care about that
And when kissing me
She gives me effortless
And that I don't have a weight
But she doesn't care about that
And when kissing me
She gives me effortless, Galán, Galán

Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come with me
I make me come with me here, here here
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come with me
I make me come with me here

[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra, Kenny Man & both]
Yatra, Yatra
Like you, like me
Like moon and the sun
Like Eva and Adam
Wendy Love, Peter Pan (Yatra)
As the sky is blue, you are hot and you are cool
If you leave me I am your gallant, gallant
Fake, fake, fake, I don't want fake to you
You are more than i can take
For you I never beat
I want Old School's love
Like Jack and Rose, full
If you leave me I am your gallant, gallant

She does not want Fendi, neither Gucci nor Prada
She doesn't care if I look for her in a lad
With you is empty, with me you feel loved
Even if you have it to 'and I can't give him anything
On weekends she invites me to your jacuzzi
The clothes I buy 'is me who looks at her
I don't know about champagne, either Europe or sushi
I do it 'in your bed and in your Sabanita Gucci

[Choir: Kenny Man, Sebastián Yatra & both]
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come with me
I make me come with me here, here here
Have what you have
And even keep it
I make me come with me
I make me come with me here, here here

[Verse 3: Sebastián Yatra]
You don't fall in love with a Balenciaga
Because sincere love is not paid
You just care what I do to you
You just care what I do to you
Does not want Gucci or Dolce Gabbana
Want my kisses all week
Because sincere love always wins
Because sincere love always wins
[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra, Kenny Man & both]
I love you, I love you
Without money she loves me
But with sincere love, sincere love
I have what she prefers
Because if you love me, I love you
You give it 'what you have'
And I prefer your smile than money
Kenny Man
Yatra, Yatra

[Saying: Sebastián Yatra & Kenny Man]
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada
Gucci or Prada
Gucci, neither Gucci, nor Gucci nor Prada
Gucci or Prada
Gucci or Prada
Gucci, neither Gucci, nor Gucci nor Prada
She doesn't want Gucci or Prada
He wants Kenny Man or Yatra
Because for love it is not paid (Wuh)
