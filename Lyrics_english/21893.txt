Reanimate // Disintegrate LyricsI reanimate
Then disintegrate
I reanimate
Then disintegrate

Standing at the edge of the earth looking back at the life I lived
Cold and decomposed, there's nothing left for me to give
I gave everything I had just so I could amount to something
Cold and decomposed, there's nothing left
I always thought I was nothing
I am nothing
We are nothing
We were all just fantasizing
Falsified visions, ego based dеcisions
The illusion of free will
We may be free but wе still choose to be their fucking slaves
We were digging our own graves

Falsified visions
We may be free but we still choose to be a slave
We were digging our own graves

Standing at the edge of the earth looking back at the life I lived
Cold and decomposed
There's nothing left for me to give
I gave everything I had just so I could amount to something
Cold and decomposed, there's nothing left
I always thought I was nothing

Disintegrating into nothingness
Convergence of earth and flesh below the precipice

Suffering
Wondering
Fade away
I decay
You might also likeSuffering, wondering
Is there a reason for this or is it all just worthless?
Fade away, I decay
Like the fallen leaves of autumn
I will not be forgotten

The distorted illusion of reality
Spoonfed to the mouths of humanity, insanity
This is the calamity
They obey the clandestine instructions planted into their minds
Transcending dimensions of parallel, to summon the flames of hell

Standing at the edge of the earth looking back at the life I lived
Cold and decomposed, there's nothing left for me to give
I gave everything I had just so I could amount to something
Cold and decomposed, there's nothing left
I always thought I was nothing

I am nothing
We are nothing
I am nothing
We are nothing
I always thought I was nothingEmbed
