Indie Rokkers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I like the line between your belly and your thighs
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smell of your hair, the sparkle in your eyes
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The smoke in your breath, the breathing hard and heavy
The back of your neck, the shine on your Chevy
The moon was so big when I drove it to the levy, girl
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
And my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear
[Verse 2]
The clean dreams, the sexy limousine
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
Jason's got the energy, he used to be a coke fiend
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)
The skinny brown arms coming out of your shirt
Heart is in the right place, brain is in the dirt
You live life like everyone's an enemy
(Rollin’ on, rollin’ on)

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I’m a young man in my prime (that's right)
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on clear
And it goes on clear
And it goes on clear6Embed
