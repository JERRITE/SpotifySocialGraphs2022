My departure with you Lyrics [lyrics by "My Departure with You"]

[Intro: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
I am disgusting to think that getting to kiss you was going crazy (I was going crazy)
I told you yes, then I regretted your mouth
You wanted to show me up, what a shame I felt when I saw myself in your photos (when I saw myself in your photos)
I went out because they say that one nail takes another

[Choir: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
My departure with you was the worst of the year
You did not leave tip, all for tacaño
We walked ten blocks, my feet hurt
All for not paying the valet
And I wanted with you, but not so much
In less than an hour you lost the charm
With you make me want to come back
But to return with my ex
[Verse 1: Kenya os]
go figure
So that I say that with him I want to go back (I want to come back)
That's how bad it was that with you I spent it
I know it, I already saw it
Better bad for known than good to know

[Pre-Coro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
You were a bad step
Pure lost time
Don't look for me
You don't even serve as a friend
You were a bad step (you were a bad step)
Pure lost time (pure lost time)
Don't look for me
You don't even serve as a friend

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
My departure with you was the worst of the year
You did not leave tip, all for tacaño
We walked ten blocks, my feet hurt
All for not paying the valet
And I wanted with you, but not so much
In less than an hour you lost the charm
With you make me want to come back
But to return with my ex

I gave you only a few hours, I almost lose the crown
I thought it was perfect, for me a gentleman
It was not worth being the entire night
With someone who lacks a couple

[Pre-Caro: Ashley Grace & Kenia Os]
You were a bad step (you were a bad step)
Pure lost time (pure lost time)
Don't look for me (don't look for me)
You don't even serve as a friend

[Choir: Kenya Os, Ashley Grace, Ashley Grace & Kenia Os, Hanna Nicole]
My departure with you was the worst of the year
You did not leave tip, all for tacaño
We walked ten blocks, my feet hurt
All for not paying the valet
And I wanted with you, but not so much
In less than an hour you lost the charm
With you make me want to come back
But to return with my ex

[Outro: Ashley Grace]
That's how bad I spent it
Eh, ey-yeah
And I wanted with you (with you)
Pure lost time
