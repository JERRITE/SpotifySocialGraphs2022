The silly phrase of the week Lyrics [lyrics of "the silly phrase of the week"]

[Verse 1]
I will not be the one who wakes you every morning
Like a little boy screaming in front of your house
I will not be behind you when you fall
But I don't sincerely believe that you need

[Verse 2]
I will not be the one to guide your steps when you miss
I will not continue to burn nights in front of your door
I will not be to load on my back
But I don't sincerely believe that you need
[Chorus]
And I know you will be better when I leave
And I know that everything will continue as if nothing
I will remain lost between airplanes, between songs and roads
In the distance I will not be your incomplete part
And I know you will be better when I leave
And I know that everything will continue as if nothing
While I write about the sand the silly phrase of the week
Even if you are not to read it on this beach

[Verse 3]
Not that I want to become a memory
But it is not easy to survive with dreams
Not that I don't want to be with you at all times
But this time I can't give you what I don't have

[Chorus]
And I know you will be better when I leave
And I know that everything will continue as if nothing
I will remain lost between airplanes, between songs and roads
In the distance I will not be your incomplete part
And I know you will be better when I leave
And I know that everything will continue as if nothing
While I write about the sand the silly phrase of the week
Even if you are not to read it on this beach, on this beach

And I know you will be better when I leave
And I know that everything will continue as if nothing
While I write about the sand the silly phrase of the week
Even if you are not to read it on this beachAmbed
