I Choose You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your smile, your voice
Creeps inside my heart with everything you do
I have no choice
Loving you is all that I know how to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when your head was heavy
You was still holding me up
Even when you were in pieces
You would hold me together
Even though I was your baby
You always saw the fight in me
One that was there to hold my back
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I choose you over anybody else?
When you're not around, it's just bad for my health
I'm good on my own, but with you, I'm something else
You're telling me to choose up, but I already choose you

[Post-Chorus]
I choose you, you, I choose you, you
They say it's choose up season, finally I got a reason
Yeah, and I want you, you, I choose you, you
Everybody needs someone to hold it down
I choose you

[Verse 2]
Your soul breathes into my body like a cloud of smoke
I should have known
That you'd stay in my system even when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when your head was heavy
You was still holding me up
Even when you were in pieces
You would hold me together
Even though I was your baby
You always saw the fight in me
One that was there to hold my back
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you know that I choose you over anybody else?
When you're not around it's just bad for my health
I'm good on my own, but with you, I'm something else
You're telling me to choose up, but I already choose you

[Post-Chorus]
I choose you, you, I choose you, you
They say it's choose up season, finally I got a reason
Yeah, and I want you, you, I choose you, you
Everybody needs someone to hold it down
I choose you

[Bridge: Pell]
Choose you like Pokemon, Ash that while we float along
On top one another like pile of combs
When you hit my phone, make it thunderstorm
Let's practice what them text preach
You saying that you chose me
I'm 'bout to cancel my plans
I'm saying that I chose we
No matter the season, I wanna fall in it
Let's spring back up, summer salt when I'm with you
Wishing for a winter so I could hibernate 'til it finish
Girl, I'm a bad witness
That you done went and chose up
But deep and down is your love
Pinot inside of that glass
That's how you winding me up
[Chorus]
Don't you know that I choose you over anybody else?
When you're not around, it's just bad for my health
I'm good on my own, but with you, I'm something else
You're telling me to choose up, but I already choose you

[Post-Chorus]
I choose you, you, I choose you, you
They say it's choose up season, finally I got a reason
Yeah, and I want you, you, I choose you, you
Everybody needs someone to hold it down
I choose youEmbed
