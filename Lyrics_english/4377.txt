Hesitate with you Lyrics [letter of "hesitate with you"]

[Pre-car]
A little alcohol say it's not bad
Pa 'kill my nerves I have to smoke
You don't have to meet much less talk
Don't vo 'grab hands or kiss you

[Chorus]
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speaking of course, vamo 'to be beautiful
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speaking of course, I want to be beautiful (aha)
[Verse 1: Ã±ejo]
I like your style (how?), I like your outfit
And that the hair reaches you to the buttocks is great (Nice)
If you want you vote and I let me know or if you want to enhance
You know what I want, mommy, I don't sell dreams
I enjoy fame today in case I no longer have
If you don't want to 'release ma', don't hurry ', I understand
That you are 'my wife, my sky, na' of that I intend
But you tell me 'black, if I leave or if I come

Vamo 'to beautiful
Vamo 'to beautiful

[Bridge]
Tell me, what vamo 'to do? And Vamono 'Pal fucking
That tomorrow there is no job
And you can 'IRNO' well Pata'abajo
Tell me, what vamo 'to do? And Vamono 'Pal fucking
That tomorrow there is no job
And you can 'IRNO' well Pata'abajo

[Pre-car]
A little alcohol say it's not bad
Pa 'kill my nerves I have to smoke
There is no conordination 'much less talk
Don't vo 'grab hands or kiss you
[Chorus]
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speaking of course, vamo 'to be beautiful
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speak of course, I want to be beautiful

[Verse 2]
Today the night is to have a good time (how?)
Save the gun or put it on the temple
I care about 'fuck if I walk' with one hundred (nah)
I walk 'over the Mercedes Benz (Wuh)
But peace and love more substance and alcohol
And if it gives me an overdame 'that they don't take me to the doctor
Better reserve a very hard girl
That rises by breathing from mouth to mouth

[Bridge]
Tell me, what vamo 'to do? And Vamono 'Pal fucking
That tomorrow there is no job
And you can 'IRNO' well Pata'abajo
Tell me, what vamo 'to do? And Vamono 'Pal fucking
That tomorrow there is no job
And you can 'IRNO' well Pata'abajo
[Pre-car]
A little alcohol say it's not bad
Pa 'kill my nerves I have to smoke
There is no conordination 'much less talk
Don't vo 'grab hands or kiss you

[Chorus]
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speaking of course, vamo 'to be beautiful
What I want is to hesitate
What dance 'with me
Speak of course, I want to be beautiful
