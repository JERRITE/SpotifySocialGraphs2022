Please Do Not Lean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweet Emily, my bride to be
Just how long will you stand next to me?
For we both know, it's more than a load
For you to bear
It'd break my heart but I'd understand if you'd
Leave me for another man with a little
Less on his mind, less on his plate
Less in his brain

[Chorus]
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able
[Verse 2]
Sex in the air, I'm deep in despair
Could you please act like you're unaware?
But we both know I'm just a dog chasin' his bone
Please understand, I'm just a man that's nearly
Figured out his master plan
Just stick around and you gon' see
I'm worth every pound

[Chorus]
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able

[Verse 3]
The more that we both try to fight it
The harder it's gon' be
I wish that we could stand united, instead we're crumblin'
I know that you gon' always love me
In spite of things you've seen
In spite of things you've heard me say
No matter how obscene

[Outro]
If I am the sky (If I am the sky), you are the sea
Starin' back at me
If I am the sky (If I am the sky), you are the sea
Starin' back at me
If I am the sky (If I am the sky), you are the sea
Starin' back at meYou might also like5Embed
