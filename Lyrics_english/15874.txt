Hanging in your hands Lyrics [letter of "hanging in your hands" ft. Marta Sanchez]

[Verse 1: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez]
Maybe it was not coincidence to find me with you
Maybe this was done by fate
I want to fall asleep in your chest
And then they wake up your kisses
Your sixth meaning dreams of me
I know we will be united soon
That naughty smile that lives with me
I know I will be on your way soon
[Pre-stribe: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez, both]
You know I'm hanging on your hands
Hmm, so don't drop me
You know I'm hanging on your hands

[Chorus: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez, both]
I send you poems of my handwriting
I send you four forty songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so you remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands
Be careful that my heart is hanging in your hands

[Verse 2: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez]
I will not lose hope to talk to you
HMM, I don't care what destiny says
I want to have your fragrance with me
And drink from you the forbidden

[Pre-stribe: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez, both]
You know I'm hanging on your hands
Hmm, so don't drop me
You know I'm hanging on your hands

[Chorus: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez, both]
I send you poems of my handwriting
I send you four forty songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so-so remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands

(Careful, careful, very careful, careful
Marta, I tell you, you have me in your hands
(Be careful, very care)
No matter what destiny says, stay with me
(Be careful, very care)
I want everything about you: your 'lip', your non -prohibited love; Oh

[Chorus: Carlos Baute, Marta Sanchez, both]
I send you poems of my handwriting
I send you four forty songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so-so remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands
Be careful that my heart is hanging in your hands
That my heart is hanging in your hands
That my heart is hanging in your hands2embed
