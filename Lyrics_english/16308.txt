Light Up the Night Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe]
This city's sleeping like a soldier
Trapped inside of an iron lung
Machines can keep you breathing
But what happens when you find a new war's begun?
Flip a switch and turn it off, you won't be able to breathe
So either way you're a casualty
I've got this burning like my veins
Are filled with nothing but gasoline
And with a spark it's gonna be
The biggest fire they've ever seen
Cut me down or let me run, either way it's all gonna burn
The only way that they'll ever learn- we've got to turn it off
Flip a switch
[Chorus 1: Joe]
And light up the night
There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out
But I can still feel the heat on my skin
And this mess we're in, where you and I
Maybe you and I
We can still make it right
Maybe we can bring back the light

[Verse 2: Thomas Light & Choir]
(At the heart of the city)
At the heart of the city
There is a building that looks down over all there is
(And the man in the tower controls it all)
And the man in the tower controls it all
Without raising a single fist
(It's like they've gathered up the city and now)
It's like they've gathered up the city, they sold it to the Devil and now
It's gone to hell and they wonder how (It's gone to hell and they wonder how, oh)
Well, a friend once told me
Men, they would follow any man who would turn the wheels
(Now the wheels are spinning out of control)
But now the wheels are spinning out of control
What would they do if we held them still? (If you destroy the working parts)
If you destroy the working parts, what you'll get is a broken machine
A beacon of light from a burning screen (A beacon of light from a burning screen)

Light it up

[Chorus 1: Joe & Choir]
Light up the night
(Light up the night)
There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out
But I can still feel the heat on my skin
And this mess we're in, where you and I
Maybe you and I
We can light up the night

[Bridge: Choir]
Light up the night
Light up the night
Ah, ah
Ooh

[Chorus 1: Joe & Choir]
Then we can light up the night
(Light up the night)
There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out
But I can still feel the heat on my skin
And this mess we're in, where you and I
Maybe you and I
We can light up the night
[Chorus 2: Joe & Choir]
(Light up the night)
There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There is a fire that will burn through the streets of the city
And we will stand in the light, we will stand in the light
You and I
Maybe you and I
We can bring back the light

[Chorus 2: Joe, Thomas Light & Choir]
(Light up the night)
There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There is a fire that will burn through the streets of the city
And we will stand in the light, we will stand in the light
You and I
You and I
We can bring back the light1Embed
