Watching the River Run Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you've been thinking you're all that you've got
Then don't feel alone anymore
When we're together, then you've got a lot
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on, oh, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, run
[Verse 2]
Winding and swirling and dancing along
We pass by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as we sing them our song
Rejoicing together when we greet the sea

[Chorus]
And it goes on and on, watching the river run
(Watching the river)
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, run
And it goes on and on, watching the river run
(Watching the river)
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, runYou might also like1Embed
