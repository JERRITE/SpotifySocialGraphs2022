We have a secret Lyricsno forgot the day I saw you
You were very hugged
I don't know if in love
Well, I looked at you and you also saw me
Of course I smiled
I got out of the soul
I did not plan
Remember that someone exists with me
I already know it
That in finding you late
But I find out, when I look at you
That between the two something may be
Between you and I have a secret
We don't write it, but we read it
We get dumb, sometimes crazy
But your eyes tell me that
Between you and I have a secret
And one day of these I'm going to steal a kiss
With passion and you will see that this secret
It can become love
That's why I did this song
To dance
Your name is missing, it is caution
But it is dedicated
I already know it
That in finding you late
But I find out, when I look at you
That between the two something may be
Between you and I have a secret
We don't write it, but we read it
We get dumb, sometimes crazy
But your eyes tell me that
Between you and I have a secret
And one day of these I'm going to steal a kiss
With passion a kiss with passion
I know there is someone else in your heart
But I also know that everything
He uses war and love
Between you and I have a secret
And one day of these I'm going to steal a kiss
With passion and you will see that this secret
It can become love
And you will see that this secret
You can become Amoryou Might Also Likeembed
