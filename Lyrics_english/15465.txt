Bad Lyrics milk ["bad milk"]

[Verse 1]
What a pity for you
What are you carrying there?
That heart
Dead and colorless

[Saying]
And what fault had to love you, skull?
You are to blame that I don't love you anymore
[Verse 2]
What a pity for you
Don't realize
Don't realize
What a pity for you

[Chorus]
Today I will stop drinking from your bad milk
Today I bury you for always
Already, go to pray what you don't think
Today I bury you for you always, for your bad milk

[Verse 3]
I met the devil closely
Without ever stepping on hell
I got into the limbo of love
Although I know that romance is a story
I'm singing a song dedicated to your friend, heartbreak
He takes, with you, better than me

[Saying]
And what fault had to love you, skull?
You are to blame that I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]
Today I will stop drinking from your bad milk
Today I bury you for always
Already, go to pray what you don't think
Today I bury you for you always, for your bad milk

What a pity for you, what a shame for you, what a shame for you
What a pity for you, what a shame for you, what a shame for you
What a pity for you, what a shame for you, what a shame for you
What a pity for you, what a shame for you, what a shame for you

[Chorus]
Today I will stop drinking from your bad milk
Today I bury you for always
Already, go to pray what you don't think
Today I bury you for you always, for your bad milkBed
