40oz. to Freedom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got your hair permed, you've got your red dress on
Screaming that second gear was such a turn-on
And the fog forming on my window tells me that the morning's here
And you'll be gone before too long
Who taught you those new tricks? Damn, I shouldn't start that talk
But life is one big question when you're starin' at the clock
And the answer's always waiting at the liquor store
40 ounces to freedom so I'll take that walk
And I know that
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, not going back
Oh, God knows, I'm not going back
Oh, I not going

[Verse 2]
And you look so fine, when you lie, it just don't show
But I know which way the wind blows
A 40 ounce to freedom is the only chance I have
To feel good, even though I feel bad
And I know that

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, God knows (God knows) I'm not going back
Oh, I, not going

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, ah (ah) I'm not going back
Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, God knows (God knows) not going back
