[Verse 1: Latto]
Calm down, yes, let me check something (ahn)
Please do not check for me until the check reaches
He asked me what my horoscope is, I said, "A dollar
I'm shitting for you and yours because I'm going to die for mine
Hundreds Blue in Birkin Pink (Birkin)
Passing without limit like I were a big person (yes)
They say I'm curving brothers, yes, the bitch is full of curves (yes)
I keep quite when I finish, he will need a perky (woo)
[Chorus: Latto]
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (yes)
I keep the pussy juicy as if you were marinated (ahn)
The way I'm killing this fucking, I need to interrogate (woo)

[Verse 2: Latto]
I enter the imported car and I parked in front (scop)
Relaxing a lot when I am lighting a blunt
The sluts are knowing that I am one of those
You can have your bro back when I finish (yes)
I like my brothers in the field like Beckham (yes)
I made him get out of a check when I met him (when I met him)
He will fuck and be bankrupt if I leave it
When I find a bro, that's what I tell him (that's what I tell him)

[Chorus: Latto]
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (yes)
I keep the pussy juicy as if you were marinated (ahn)
The way I'm killing this fucking, I need to interrogate (woo)
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (ahn)
There is not something like enough, love (no)
Bitch boss, I have mine, but you can update it (woo)

[Verse 3: Latto]
Look, wet pussy will cost you (yes)
But don't confuse, I can turn around without you (by God)
I need these bottega boots with the light background (yes)
If I already dealt with him, then I still took him (ha)
Mugler's leggings hugging my ass
I took the Fifth Generation Glock in the Clutch (Boop)
If my bills are not paid, he's not doing enough (what?)
The brothers are not shit, they are barely enough, fucking?

[Chorus: Latto]
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (yes)

[Verse 4: jt]
Unpleasant bitch, turns the stick as gymnastics
Street bitch, how do you think I end up in the palace? (Money)
Great house, great diamonds
I stopped in that drop, the sluts don't look excited (ah)
Black bitch dressed in Louis
New ass, snails want to feel my ass
My life is a movie, I'm the star, for sure (yes)
City Girls are why you sluts know Birkins (facts)

[Verse 5: Yung Miami]
I cheered for the ballad like a track, bitch
Cat smoking like a blunt, bitch, I bet your man wants to hit
Sneaky leak with rich brothers, smarter than that
And if you come an envious bitch, send her a kiss (Mwah)
Bop for the ballad, I see that they are wallets here
Miami on site, so there are cameras here
Ugly sluts are hating, I can say for the brightness
The way you talk shit, I can tell these veneers

[Chorus: Latto]
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (yes)
I keep the pussy juicy as if you were marinated (ahn)
The way I'm killing this fucking, I need to interrogate (woo)
I want my accounts paid (yes), paid rent (yes)
Nails made (aham), hair rocks (ahn)
There is not something like enough, love (no)
Bitch boss, I have mine, but you can update it (woo)
