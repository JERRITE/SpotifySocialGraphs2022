The Lyricsletra air of "El Aire" ft. The flaka

[Intro: Vizio]
The air that took what we wrote in the sand
The air that took what we wrote in the sand
Air that brings and takes you, air that erases the sorrows
Watercolor -painted air, where promises fly

[Pre-stribe: Bizio]
Where are the hopes that I lost, I lost
At the side of promises that I gave you, I gave you
[Chorus: pepe and flaka]
The air took it ...
How many times was I close and the air took it?
And without realizing it, I was late
Today we pay the promises that the air took, -Ire, -ire, -ire
Castles in the air, -ire, -ire, -ire

[Verse 1: flaka]
It is the air of a sigh that air that you leave
I am pure like air, air
Feel free to be able to fly, looking for the air as comets
Change course to breathe and may my hair move

[Pre-stribe: flaka]
With the air of a sigh, it is the air you leave
I am pure, I am air, air

[Chorus: pepe and flaka]
The air took it ... how many times was I near and the air took it?
And without realizing it, I was late
Today we pay the promises that the air took, -Ire, -ire, -ire
Castles in the air, -ire, -ire, -ire

[Verse 2: pepe]
Where will the dreams we don't fulfill?
Where will the faith go that one day we had?
I already know that the prettier things do not have to
If in this world you suffer is because you are alive, I live

I accepted that the truth is not always where I look, I look
I'm already alone with God

[Chorus: pepe and flaka]
The air took it ... how many times was I near and the air took it?
And without realizing it, I was late
Today we pay the promises that the air took, -Ire, -ire, -ire
Castles in the air, -ire, -ire, -ire

[Outro: V.Vizio]
The air that took what we wrote in the sand
The air that took what we wrote in the sand
Air that brings and takes you, air that erases the sorrows
Watercolor -painted air, where promises Vuelanembed
