Talk Quiet Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another day, another dawn
And me tryna focus up my, my mind
I want it bad
We on the green list, you seen this?
Now go give 'em more

[Chorus]
Are you sure you gon' be pleased for me
When I'm no longer giving you my time?
Are you sure you wanna speak for me?
That privilege's saved for family ties
[Verse 2]
You're makin' a mess for me, you ain't finish that fast
Streets threw me you, and then I threw you right back
Gave up so easily, but we heal and days pass
Wanna see me with no mask?

[Post-Chorus]
But I roll with a squad
And we move through the night
When everyone's sleepin', yeah
It's on job, we on sight (On sight, on sight)
And get what I want, I never ask twice
If you hear me repeatin' things
I'm known to talk quiet (Talk quiet, talk quiet, talk quiet)

[Break]
(Oh, you talk mad quiet, you know?)
(Can't even hear nothin' you're sayin')

[Verse 3]
What kinda last laugh, bad batch
Of stock you sellin' me here?
You think I ain't preein'?
No, you ain't that daft
What's the name of that shop you used to bag at? (Sainsbury's)
You think I really wouldn't catch that?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I got no safety embedded
I'm still green, not clever
You knew who you were
But I thought I knew better
Same old ways, I've been frustrated
Wish I had more fuckin' patience

[Chorus]
Are you sure you gon' be pleased for me
When I'm no longer giving you my time? (My time)
Are you sure you wanna speak for me?
That privilege's saved for family ties

[Post-Chorus]
But I roll with a squad
And we move through the night (Night, night, night)
When everyone's sleepin', yeah
It's on job, we on sight (On sight, on sight)
And get what I want, I never ask twice
If you hear me repeatin' things
I'm known to talk quiet (Talk quiet, talk quiet, talk quiet)

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I don't care 'bout none when I'm workin'
Cut you off, if it happened, you deserved it
Can't shit stand in the way of my purpose
[Pre-Chorus]
I've got no safety embedded
I'm still green, not clever
You knew who you were
But I thought I knew better
Same old ways, I've been frustrated
Wish I had more fuckin' patience

[Chorus]
Are you sure you gon' be pleased for me
When I'm no longer giving you my time? (My time, my time, my time)
Are you sure you wanna speak for me?
That privilege's saved for family ties

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I roll with a squad (Squad, squad)
And we move through the night (Night, night)
When everyone's sleepin', yeah
We on job, it's on sight (On sight, on sight, on sight)
And get what I want, I never ask twice
If you hear me repeatin' things
I'm known to talk quiet (Talk quiet, talk quiet)
But I roll with a squad (Squad, squad)
And we move through the night (Night, night)
When everyone's sleepin', yeah
We on job, it's on sight (On sight, on sight)
And get what I want, I never ask twice (No twice)
If you hear me repeatin' things
I'm known to talk quiet
(Talk quiet, talk quiet, talk quiet, talk quiet, talk quiet)Embed
