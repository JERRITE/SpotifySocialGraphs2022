I was born for this lyrics [letter from "I was born for this"]

[Intro]
I have a list of things to feel, not to do
And when you complete it, God will say

[Verse]
I have a list of things to feel, not to do
And when you complete it, God will say
I have left the good see of the calité
When what kills me, is to censor me
I know that sometimes the air is short of the sharpening that I think
That is why I interpret it as a sin, and I am not able
But it's bad, Rеal, I don't feel spoil
I neither feel poet, nor shit of those
Mine is banal, even commercial
Todito so trivial, only that it is respected
Because whole reflects me, because it inspires you purity
100% certainty, although it hurts a quintal
[Chorus]
I know that I was born for this and there is no more '
Revoke the world to break
A poison that beats the compá '
I give you the saltpeter of my sea
I know that I was born for this and there is no more '
Revoke the world to break
A poison that beats the beat
I give you the saltpeter of my sea

[Bridge]
And I dissociate to me, I'm not from this place
I don't know if I'm blessed or possessed by Satan
Like the waters to April, click and not bleed
And get horny, because I vibro in my wave
When I hug my discomfort
A sand scratch and a lime scratch
And dissocio from me, I'm not from this place
I don't know if I'm blessed or possessed by Satan
Like the waters to April, click and not bleed
And get horny, because I vibro in my wave
When I hug my discomfort
A sand scratch and a lime scratch

[Chorus]
I know that I was born for this and there is no more '
Revoke the world to break
A poison that beats the compá '
I give you the saltpeter of my sea
I know that I was born for this and there is no more '
Revoke the world to break
A poison that beats the beat
I give you the saltpeter of my Maryou Might Also Likeembed
