Devil I Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I made a big mistake
You keep messing with my brain
You tell me eat the whole cake, it's what I deserve
Every time I take your lead, feels like a curse
And every time I try to stop, feels even worse
(Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the devil I know (I know)
Better than the devil I don't (I don't)
Maybe I could stop, but I won't (I won't)
'Cause, baby, you're the devil I know (I know)
I know
[Post-Chorus]
I could pretend that I'm just praying now
But I'm only on my knees

[Verse 2]
I want to, wanna get free (Get free)
But staying with you is easier (Easy), than leaving
Feels like a holiday breeze when we go up
But you bring me down to my knees when push comes to shove
Guess that's the price that you pay when you're in love
(Uh, uh)

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the devil I know (I know)
Better than the devil I don't (I don't)
Maybe I could stop, but I won't (I won't)
'Cause, baby, you're the devil I know (I know)
I know

[Bridge]
I could pretend that I'm just praying now
But I'm only on my knees
I could scream, “Somebody help me out”
But the wicked one is me, hee-hee

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the devil I know (I know, I know, ooh)
Better than the devil I don't (Better than the devil that I don't)
Maybe I could stop, but I won't (I won't, I won't, oh)
'Cause, baby, you're the devil I know (I know)
You might also like[Outro]
You're going to Heaven 'cause you are the devil I know
You are the devil I know
Baby, I'm the devil now5Embed
