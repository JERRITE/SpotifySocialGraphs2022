Blue Angel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Light a candle I'll follow
I can't see in the dark
I'm not ready to go
I'm awake

[Chorus]
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow
Falls like snow
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow
Falls like snow
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow
[Verse 2]
Hearts are frozen, no words to say
I said I'd go and it's okay
But I-

[Chorus]
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)
Falls like snow (snow, snow)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)
Falls like snow (snow, snow)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)

[Bridge]
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel

[Chorus (Shortened)]
Falls like snow
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (I was your blue angel)
Falls like snow (I was your blue angel)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snowYou might also like2Embed
