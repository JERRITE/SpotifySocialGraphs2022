Fortunate Son (The Weathermaker Vault Series) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white, and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
Oh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no
[Verse 2]
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, no
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More, more, more!"

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one
You might also like[Outro]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate sonEmbed
