Sail (Feed Me Remix) LyricsSAIL!

This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A-D-D baby

This is how an angel cries
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A-D-D baby

SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
(sail)
Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (myself)
Blame it on my A-D-D baby

Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my A-D-D baby

SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
(sail)

La la la la la, La la la la la ooh
La la la la la, La la la la la ooh

SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!

SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
