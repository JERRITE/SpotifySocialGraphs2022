My whole world lyrics [lyrics by "my whole world (bachata version)"]

Do not feel bad if you have the need to do it
You don't have to be here if you have the mind elsewhere
When the heart says it is not difficult to convince him
I will not be the one who cuts your wings if your dreams are flying

That's what love is about
To make the other happy
And that's what I would like
When you think about my
Know that I'm going to be bimination
Although at first it hurts me
Because you were my whole world
And I hope
Never forget that I love you
If I'm honest
I do not want
But I know that pain is passenger

You were my whole world
And I hope
Never forget that I love you
If I'm honest
I do not want
But I know that pain is passenger

I'm going to call Romeo to sing with adventure
Today it hurts but I know that tomorrow I find cure
I no longer see you I know that it will be my torture
That another is enjoying your follies

I can make me the fort and say that I don't feel na
But from a spite I have the symptoms
And I don't tell you to feel bad
Yeee
But you hurt me
You left in another direction and you moved away
You left me badly
You might also like you were my whole world
And I hope
Never forget that I love you
If I'm honest
I do not want
But I know that pain is passenger

You were my whole world
And I hope
Never forget that I love you
If I'm honest
I do not want
But I know that pain is passenger

I hope that new love that you have up to it because what I did to you Mamita does not have cureembed
