To Lau Lyrics [letter from "al lau"]

[Verse 1]
Oh oh
What do you need to lie to you?
This pod does not change it for anything (mmm)
I always love you
Although fighting 'to√≠ta' the 'week'
Anxiety kills me when I don't have you close
It gives me depression and although it does not seem
I want them to be 11:11 to ask you to appear
[Pre-car]
What are your plans today? What are you doing?
I invite you to spend my bed
For us to make the peace, yeah (ah)
I know you, I know why you do it
That's why I already want you to pass
What you fix this and not pass it

[Chorus]
To the 'of me, to La'o, to the'
To the 'of me, to the', to the
To the 'of me, to the', to the
Cerquita, Cerquita
To the 'of me, to the', to the
To the 'of me, to the' al'o (ey)
To the 'of me, to the', to the
Cerquita (OH)

[Verse 2]
Baby, you'll see that it takes me away
When you kiss me my mouth, my love (my love)
As if what happened never happened (no, no)
To forget
I forgot what you did (Yeah)
I know it was your fault this time (Wuh!)
And mine again (ey; mmm)
And if the page passes (what?)
Vamo 'A Eat' and fixed ', Yeah (vamo')

Vamo ', vamo', that time is passing (ey)
To'a my clothes I'm already taking it off
This discussion already has me thinking (OH)
That is richer when we are fighting (eh-eh)
Vamo ', vamo', that time is passing (UH-UH)
To'a my clothes I'm already taking it off
This discussion already has me thinking (OH-OH)
That is richer when we are fighting

[Pre-car]
What are your plans today? What are you doing? (Hey)
I invite you to spend my bed
For us to make the peace, yeah (yeah-yeah; ah)
I know you, I know why you do it
That's why I already want you to pass
So that you fix this and the night you spend it

[Chorus]
To the 'of me, to the' to the
To the 'of me, to the' to the
To the 'of me, to the' al'o (al la la'o)
Cerquita, Cerquita (Ey)
To the 'of me, to the', to the
To the 'of me, to the' al'o (mmm)
To the 'of me, to the' al'o (ah)
Cerquita (Cerquita)
