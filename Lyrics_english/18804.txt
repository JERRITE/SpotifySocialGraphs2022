My Hands Are Empty Lyrics[Verse 1: Flynn]
Misery, cover me in waves
This heartache is slowly
Withering, I become her slave
Succumb to the darkness
Suffocating like I'm drowning in sand
Depression's got me by her cold dead hands
Treachery, the choices you made
Cut my heart open with this golden blade

[Chorus: MacEachern]
My hands are empty, lies so petty
My hands are empty, kill me gently
[Verse 2: Flynn]
Medicate, I watched you slowly die
The powders and pills
Disintеgrate, you right before my еyes
The emptiness haunts me
Glass reflections of a cold dead stare
Ingesting chemicals of death with no care
Memories, they haunt me they stain
Of what you once meant to me before this pain

[Chorus: MacEachern]
My hands are empty, lies so petty
My hands are empty, kill me gently

[Bridge: Flynn]
I, I will not hide these scars of mine
Take away the shame
I, I will not be what's left behind
Find someone else to blame
Forgiveness, constricted
No longer human
A ghost in time

[Lead - Mader]

[Bridge: Flynn]
I, I will not hide these scars of mine
Take away the shame
I, I will not be what's left behind
Find someone else to blame
Forgiveness, constricted
No longer human
A ghost in time

My hands are empty, lies so petty
My hands are empty, kill me gently
My hands are empty, lies so petty
My hands are empty, kill me gently2Embed
