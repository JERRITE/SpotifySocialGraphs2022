TranslationEngishtan Easy Lyrics ["Tan easy" letter]

[Verse 1: Christopher]
I want your eyes to look at me
And may your lips kiss me
So you never forget me
Tell me what you think

[Pre-Caro: Christopher]
It will be so easy, for me it will be so easy
Get to your heart, fill you with illusion
It will be so easy, for you it will be so easy
Get to my heart, fill me with illusion
[Chorus: All]
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love

[Verse 2: Erick]
I am falling in love, I don't know what is happening
I think they are your eyes that are bewitching me
You have me crazy baby, you have me at your feet
From the first time I saw you you fell in love
You astonished me with how pretty you see
From the feet to the head everything looks good for you
Since you arrived my world is the other way around

[Saying: Richard]
And with you, I just want to be with you
I want to stop time when you look at me 'And I look at you
And just with you, I just want to be with you
I want to stop time when you look at me 'And I look at you

[Chorus: All]
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love

It will be your eyes, it will be your hair
And that perfume that is in your body
It's like a dream that I don't awake
When you approach I want to kiss you

[Verse 4: Christopher]
And I can't endure this desire for you
I can't endure, I love you for me
Everything change since I saw you
And next to you is that I want to be

[Saying: Richard]
And with you, I just want to be with you
I want to stop time when you look at me 'And I look at you

[Chorus: All]
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love
Because you look at me and I feel the same as you
When I look at you I feel that I'm falling in love3embed
