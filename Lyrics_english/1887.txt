Forfeit. Lyrics[Intro: Kiana Ledé]
Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, yeah

[Verse 1: Kiana Ledé]
You don't wanna try me
You better forfeit, keep fuckin' with my vibes
And I can assure you it won't end how you like
Nah, I ain't that type

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm givin' you one, two, three
To back the fuck up off of me
Don't front when you can't back it up
It's about time we wrap this shit up, mmm
So say something now
Say something now, yeah
[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé]
You must be some kinda fucked up
To be talkin' to me crazy
You be tryna call me anything
But you know, nigga, that don't phase me, I
Guess I'm 'bout to have to lay it down
I don't think you love to come around no more
See, my daddy, he a little crazy

[Bridge: Kiana Ledé]
So say something now, say something now
I dare you to say something now, say something now
Say something now, say something now, hmm
Please, say something, say something now

[Verse 3: Kiana Ledé]
Say it with your chest, you know where I'm from
Arizona desert
You don't want the smoke
You already shown you a urban legend
Yeah, you movin' too loud
You been fuckin' 'round, need to settle down (Yeah)
I see right through you like HD now

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm givin' you one, two, three
To back the fuck up off of me
Don't front when you can't back that shit up (Hey, nah)
It's about time we wrap this shit up, oh
So say something now
Say something now, yeah

Why do you always gotta push me?
You know how to do it, baby, every single button
Rather I'd leave before I lose control
We took it too far, said too many bad things
I don't want the last words, last words
Let this be the last words we share
Why do we yell if we don't care?
On some real shit

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé, Lucky Daye & Both]
I'ma give you one (One), two (Two), three
Oh, uh, don't front when you can't back that shit up (Hey, nah)
It's about time we wrap this shit up, oh
So say something now (Ow-ow-ow-ow)
Say something now, yeah

[Outro: Kiana Ledé]
Say something now, say something now
Please, say something, say something now4Embed
