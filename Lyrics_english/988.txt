Lamelo Ball Lyrics [lyrics by "Lamelo Ball"]

[Intro: Cauty]
After 'of Tre' Polvazo 'I almost felt that I marry
Is that Baby and 'a case
Like the chest to a rafagazo

[Pre-car: Cauty]
He tells me that another, oh
In the note to 'know better
She 'tá hackeá' of the superior
He left another league like Lamelo Ball
[Chorus: Cauty]
And when I snatched myself, oh-oh
Well Bellaco I talk about love
Pa 'I later tell him that this way' best
She tells me that I'm a fuckboy

[Post-car: Cauty]
It tells me that another one, another
That he does not break his cora, but please break the to,
You don't know 'how much I am mistreating me
Every VE 'that you send me' photo '

[Verse 1: cauty]
That ass in Versace
The pantics 'that gave' le cache
'Tá protected', what na 'passes you
At all times, Baby, ATH
There is a lot of 'kitten' on the street
But what you are 'in another class
That flower never expires, with that it is born

[Pre-car: Cauty]
Me-me tells me to get another one, oh
In the note to 'know better
She 'tá hackeá' of the superior
He left another league like Lamelo Ball

Pa 'I later tell him that this way' best

[Verse 2: Javiielo]
With her I get off
Don't you see it '? That baby and 'a taste
None 'and this' go' pay attention
And that's why he has me studying her as a review
And if your body and 'adventure (eh)
You are 'big and how more' hard (baby)
There is 'bad' day that have no remedy
But don't 'eat' and you heals it '(uh)
You ere 'the one
I break you and make you breakfast (Yeah, Yeah)
Bad mine if I don't presume
But I think of you na 'more' when I smoke, baby
You know 'what I give (what I give)
With no one does you do you 'send and go
Baby, that with your beautiful 'coincide

[Pre-car: Cauty]

Well Bellaco I talk about love (baby)
Pa 'I later tell him that this way' better
She tells me that I'm a fuckboy (boy)
