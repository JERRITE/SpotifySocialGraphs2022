Off At The Next Exit LyricsTell me what you want, tell me what you need tonight
Open up your arms, let me be there (ahhh) let me be there (ahhh)
Here we go again, needing to explain
Just what's in our brains is never clear (ahhh), never clear (ahhh)

Are you giving me up? Are you giving me up?
Are you giving me up, babe?
'Cause I get the fear, the more I get you near
The more you fade away, aw yeah

So what you wanna hear, is what I'm gonna say
Any games you play, I'll be here (ahhh), I'll be here (ahhh)
Are you giving me up? Are you giving me up?
Are you giving me up, babe?
'Cause I get the fear, the more I get you near
The more you fade away, aw yeah

What you gonna do when the rain comes in?
Who you gonna call to do something about it?
Who'll pick you up when you're spread too thin
When the walls you built are closing in around you? I found you
'Cause I get the fear, the more I get you near
The more you fade away, aw yeahYou might also likeEmbed
