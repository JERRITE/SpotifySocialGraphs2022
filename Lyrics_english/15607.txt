Unattainable Lyrics [verse 1: Anahí and Christian]
I feel so distant and so close at the same time
Deciphering your silence
And then I imagine inside your skin
But I lose in the attempt

[Pre-Car 1: Anahí and Christian]
And no matter how much I am looking to give you love
You never look at me
If you knew I can die for you
By you
[Chorus: RBD]
Unattainable
As a distant star
An almost impossible love
Invisible like air
You are so unattainable
As sublime as an angel
An almost impossible love
Like a fire that does not rise
You have made me unalcanza ... ble
Inalcanza ... ble

[Verse 2: sweet and Alfonso]
Pervivo on the path of your loneliness
When someone hurts you
What to tell you that there is no one else
That I love you without measure

[Pre-Car 2: Dulce y Alfonso]
How it hurts to see you sigh for who does not make you happy
If you knew I can die for you
By you

[Chorus: RBD]
Unattainable
As a distant star
An almost impossible love
Invisible like air
You are so unattainable
As sublime as an angel
An almost impossible love
Like a fire that does not rise
You have made me unalcanza ... ble
Inalcanza ... ble
Unattainable
As a distant star
An almost impossible love
Invisible like air
You are so unattainable
As sublime as an angel
An almost impossible love
Like a fire that does not rise
You have made me unalcanza ... ble
Inalcanza ... ble
