POP, LOCK & DROPDEAD Lyrics[Intro]
Hello, hey, listen!
Kudzu
Welcome to the club

[Chorus]
I spilled lean on my pants (Okay)
Life suck, oh well, true that (Okay)
Woke up and got a bag (Okay)
93 octane, that's gas
I spilled lean on my pants (Okay)
Life suck, oh well, true that (Okay)
Woke up and got a bag (Okay)
93 octane, that's gas
[Verse 1]
Got blood on my based Vans
Got knives, I don't use hands
Trust me, you not my mans
Smoke blunts with Slenderman

[Sample: EatThatPussy445]
This is ya boy, EatThatPussy445, and about like 30 to 45 minutes ago, I beat the fuck out of my dick so goddamn hard

[Verse 2]
I ride my own dick 'cause I'm feeling myself (Sauce)
I don't need a cosign, I don't need help (Woo, woo)
Got my own swag if you can't tell (Okay)
Live like I'm dead 'cause I live in hell
She like the way I do my nails (Okay)
I'ma hot boy, oh god damn (Oh god damn)
Goofy, you is comic sans (Woo woo woo)
All my apparel from Japan (Alright)

[Chorus]
I spilled lean on my pants (Okay)
Life suck, oh well, true that (Okay)
Woke up and got a bag (Okay)
93 octane, that's gas
I spilled lean on my pants (Okay)
Life suck, oh well, true that (Okay)
Woke up and got a bag (Okay)
93 octane, that's gasYou might also like15Embed
