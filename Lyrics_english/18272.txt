Could Never (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Jucee Froot]
DMac, pop your shit, DMac, pop your shit, yeah
Jucee
Lil' one hundred, bitch
Bando shit
Fuck

[Pre-Chorus: Jucee Froot]
Walk in the club, where them bands at? (Bands at)
Wasn't even stunting your nigga (Wasn't even stunting your nigga)
But bitch since you talking, tell me where your man at (Yo, where your man at?)
Pressure, zaza
They know I'm popping, them hoes can't stand that
He got me dripping, that pussy hit different
I ride it, I bet he gon' Lamb that (Skrr, skrr)
[Chorus: Jucee Froot]
These pussy hoes can't never (Never)
Irritate me and get me out my bag (Me out my bag)
These pussy hoes can't never (Never)
Fuck on my nigga, that pussy on snatch
These pussy hoes could never (Never)
Go cop a Masi pay for it in cash
These pussy hoes could never (Never)
Get up with a bitch 'cause I stay on they ass

[Verse 1: Jucee Froot]
I am that bitch, so it ain't no comparing
All this ass on me, these hoes get embarrassed
That P shit is in me, like that shit generic
I call him daddy but he ain't my parent
He put me in carats that didn't come from Jareds
Don't fuck with these niggas like my name is Karen
That shit for the birds, let them talk like a parrot
The pussy so good when he in it he swearing
Why would I care how a pussy hoe move? (Pussy hoe move)
Hating on the next bitch, thatâ€™s what pussy hoes do (Pussy hoes do)
Don't speak on me, bitch, we ain't never been cool
Why I stay up in they mouth?
'Cause none better than the Juice (Ooh)
Still that bitch, ain't none gone change (Never gon' change)
Hoess saying that it's up, they ain't never on a plane
Bitch or a nigga, I'm the hardest in the game
Iced out at my shows, I ain't tucking my chain
You might also like[Refrain: Jucee Froot]
Who else can do it like me?
Started from shit, now my music on shows on TV (Shows on TV)
Who else put on for the city? (The city)
I moved from Memphis, but bitch, I still bleed Ten-A-Key (Bleed Ten-A-Key)
What bitch is fucking with me?
Moment of silence
I'll wait
This shit is nothing to me (Nothing to me)
I shit with my diamonds (Shit with my diamonds)
X-Ray (Yee)

[Pre-Chorus: Jucee Froot]
Walk in the club, where them bands at? (Bands at)
Wasn't even stunting your nigga (Wasn't even stunting your nigga)
But bitch since you talking, tell me where your man at (Yo, where your man at?)
Pressure, zaza
They know I'm popping, them hoes can't stand that
He got me dripping, that pussy hit different
I ride it, I bet he gon' Lamb that (Skrr, skrr)

[Chorus: Jucee Froot]
These pussy hoes can't never (Never)
Irritate me and get me out my bag (Me out my bag)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Question (What? Speak for 'em)
Who from the city done did it like me? (Huh?)
I'm just tryna see, I don't see nothin' but me (Bagg)
Diamonds VV's, still'll say you'll peak (Right now)
Come from the streets, where they playin' for keeps
Black Maybach, same color my Glock, my glee (Twin)
Me and your bitch been slick, lowkey (Ooh)
Now she a part of my fleet/flick (Ooh)
Blue Lamborghini, cocaine, Forgis, no cap in my story
Could never let no bitch look above me
Strap on me while I'm recordin'
The Drac' hit 'em, made his ass hula hoop (Hoop)
Cancel him, he a snitch, he told the truth (Ha)
Shit on niggas, tell 'em, "Get the pooper scoop"
They could never come through like I'm comin' through (No)
Gap between her legs, pussy Jucee Froot/juicy fruit (Wet)
Bagg on their ass, tell me somethin' new (Threat)
I just be talkin' that real, that raw shit, the streets is who I cater to, straight up
I can never have no filter, Benjamins, hunnid shots inside this vehicule (Whole hunnid)
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I'm Memphis for real (How?)
I've been callin', runnin' M's up (I can never get enough, oh, nah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jucee Froot]
Walk in the club, where them bands at? (Bands at)
Wasn't even stunting your nigga (Wasn't even stunting your nigga)
But bitch since you talking, tell me where your man at (Yo, where your man at?)
Pressure, zaza
They know I'm popping, them hoes can't stand that
He got me dripping, that pussy hit different
I ride it, I bet he gon' Lamb that (Skrr, skrr)

[Chorus: Jucee Froot]
These pussy hoes can't never (Never)
Irritate me and get me out my bag (Me out my bag)
These pussy hoes can't never (Never)
Fuck on my nigga, that pussy on snatch
These pussy hoes could never (Never)
Go cop a Masi pay for it in cash
These pussy hoes could never (Never)
Get up with a bitch 'cause I stay on they assEmbed
