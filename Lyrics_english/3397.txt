My Year Lyrics[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim]
I'm fired up!
Tryouts today, I'm going to blow â€˜em away, yeah
Dad says I can't go wrong, no, as long as I keep this on, oh
Seabrook's been the best, like, forever
Mom's counting on me, no pressure
Cheer's in my family genes, come on, let's do this thing
Now, what up, everybody?
Let me set the scene, fresh new start for your boy, Young ZYou saw Pops, for a dad, he's cool
He's just a little stressed about my first day of school
They say, "be careful, those humans can be mean"
But I'm still going out for the football team
This might look rough, but it's home sweet home
Just a little bit of dust and a little bit of mold
But it ain't so bad on this side of tracks
We make it work with a little bit of swag
On this side, we can all keep winning
If we just try to fit in
[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & All]
Watch it come together, be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is going to be my year
Been waiting for this moment
Yeah, I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year, my year, my, my, my year
My year, my year, my year, my year

[Verse 2: Kylee Russell & Milo Manheim & James Godfrey]
Now let me introduce you to my friend Eliza
We'll never be accepted, zombies need to rise up
Fight the good fight, stand for whats right
We get the worst jobs and a curfew at night
They make us wear uniforms that all look the same
Why's it just us being treated this way?
I say we stick it to their institution
You want justice? We need a revolution!
Yeah, you got a point, but today's an improvement
'Cause baby steps is still movement
Hey, Bonzo, come and spit a verse
A zig zagg gwag gwad ziggy got gon
Ziggity got goat zag ziggy got zong
He just dropped that in zombie!
Yeah, all he said is he's hungry

My cuz, Bucky's the man
Look at how perfect he lands
Our very own cheer rock star
No more autographs, please, stay where you are
Another year and I only get better
Another cheer, another varsity letter
This year, we just can't lose
Well, I'm gonna win, you all can come too

[Chorus: All]
My year, my year, my year, my year
Watch it come together, be the best one ever
Because it's my time
This is gonna be my year
Been waiting for this moment
Yeah, I'm gonna own it
You can watch me shine
This is gonna be my year
My year, my year, my year, my year
My, my, my, year
My year my year
This is gonna be my year4Embed
