Slow reggaeton (we dance) Lyrics [verse 1: Erick & Christopher]
How good it looks
His figure brings me crazy
That short little little thing looks good
Combined with your brown lipstick
How good it looks
His waist hypnotizes me
When you dance to the gods they want to see it
I will not waste any more time, I will approach

[Chorus: All]
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
[Verse 2: Erick & Zadbiel]
Let me dance with you this piece
Among all women your beauty stands out
I love your firmness, you move with skill
Move, move, move
Very rich, Latin, you are full of life
Go up the two hands, give it up
Where are the single and those who don't, too?
Without fear, move, move, move

[Chorus: All]
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago

[Post-car: all]
Dance with Me
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago

[Bridge: Richard]
I Know You Like It When I Take You To The Floor

It is impossible to delay hours
Every minute with you is a dream
I would like to be your confidant
Why don't you dare if we do it now?
Don't get shy
We are alone

[Chorus: All]
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago

[Chorus: All]
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
I just looked at her and I liked
I stuck and invited her: "Let's dance, huh?"
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
[Post-car: all]
Move, move
B치ilalo, B치ilalo
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
Move, move
B치ilalo, B치ilalo
The night is for a slow reggaeton
Of those who do not dance a long time ago
Who are we?
CNCO!

[Outro: Erick]
How good it looks
His figure brings me crazy
That short little little thing looks good
Combined with your brown lipstick
How good it looks7
