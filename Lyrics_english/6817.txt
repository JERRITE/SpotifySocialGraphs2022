It Could Always Be Worse Lyrics[Slyly]
If the glass looks half empty
And your prospects are low
Attitude adjustment's the only way to go
Things could be worse than that

You could be lost in the desert
200 degrees
No water around
And lots of snakes and bees
Remember it's tough
And it's cold out there
Life sometimes can be unfair

So every step forward
There's a step in reverse
Things could be better
They could always be worse

Yes, things could be better
In this big universe
But remember
It could always be worse

[Other foxes]
Remember
It could always be worse

[Slyly]
You could be out to sea
With no land in sight
Surrounded by sharks
With a big appetite
Things could be worse than that

You could be lost in a forest
End up stuck up in a tree
Chased by a monster
And no way to get free
You might also likeRemember it's tough
And it's cold out there
Life sometimes can be unfair

So every step forward
There's a step in reverse
Things could be better
They could always be worse

Yes, things could be better
In this big universe
But remember
It could always be worse

[Other foxes]
Remember
It could always be worse

[Slyly]
Don't look so sad
And don't feel so bad
That's not so hard to do
'Cause things could be worse than that

Life throws you some curves
But just change your demeanor
'Cause trust me my friend
The grass it ain't always greener
Remember it's tough
And it's cold out there
Life sometimes can be unfair

[Slyly and other foxes]
So for every step forward
There's a step in reverse
Things could be better
They could always be worse

Yes, things could be better
In this big universe
But remember
It could always be worse

Remember
It could always be worse

[Slyly]
Let me hear the band

[Slyly and other foxes]
Remember it could always be
Worse

Ha, ha, ha, hah!Embed
