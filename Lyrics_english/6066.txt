One Drink Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
You see how I pull up to the party
Came in with an attitude, I'm bossy
I know that I'm keeping your attention
But I ain't tryna hook up with nobody

[Pre-Chorus]
I took nine shots, I like the way they hit me
I'm in this club and everybody tipsy, yeah
I was gonna take it nice and steady
But now I feel like getting kinda messy
I, I'm
One drink away from saying what's on my mind
Only just a drink away from
[Chorus]
Please don't touch me, just keep off me
Don't go asking for no favours
I've been nice for long enough, but
Now I'm on my worst behavior
I
Only just a drink away from
I
Only just a drink away from

[Verse 2]
I cannot be bothered to be friendly
And why'd you keep on calling me your baby?
You ain't doing nothing to impress me
So now is not the time for you to test me

[Pre-Chorus]
I took nine shots, I like the way thеy hit me
I'm in this club and everybody tipsy, yеah
I was gonna take it nice and steady
But now I feel like getting kinda messy
I, I'm
One drink away from saying what's on my mind
Only just a drink away from

[Chorus]
Please don't touch me, just keep off me
Don't go asking for no favours
I've been nice for long enough, but
Now I'm on my worst behavior
Please don't touch me, just keep off me
Don't go asking for no favours
I've been nice for long enough, but
Now I'm on my worst behavior

[Bridge]
If you ask me, I'm gon' tell ya, tell ya
I'm not afraid of causing drama, drama
And I've already blocked your number
So you can find another sucker, sucker

[Chorus]
I
Only just a drink away from
I
Only just a drink away from
Please don't touch me, just keep off me
Don't go asking for no favours
I
Only just a drink away from7Embed
