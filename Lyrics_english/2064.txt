[Verse 1: Becky G]
I like to be treated as a lady
Although sometimes I forget when we are in bed
I like to tell me poetry
In the ear at night when we rude
[Pre-car: Becky G]
I like a gentleman, it's interesting
That is a good friend but more a good lover
What do you care for a few more years?

[Chorus: Becky G]
I like elders
Of those they call gentlemen
Of those who open the door and send you flowers
I like bigger
Don't fit me in my mouth
The kisses I want to give me and go crazy

[Post-car: Becky G]
Crazy, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Crazy, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

Like me, a gentleman with twenty -one (Yeh)
I am put pa 'to' your 'follies
That you want 'an old man,' TÃ¡s safe? (Wuh)
