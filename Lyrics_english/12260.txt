Dear Enemy LyricsYou're pretending you're something you're not
You're collecting a head full of rot
You're self-righteous, the butt of the joke
And it's a secret, everyone knows

You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show you've shown it
You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show

My dear enemy, backstabbing me
Like a friend to me, like you seem to be
You think I don't see
You backstabbing me
Like a friend to me
My dear enemy
You're condescending with every word
It makes you happy but what is it worth?
You're like a virus eating my skin
It's a problem, I think it's a sin

You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show you've shown it
You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show

My dear enemy, backstabbing me
Like a friend to me, like you seem to be
You think I don't see
You backstabbing me
Like a friend to me
My dear enemy

You're pretending you're something you're not
You're collecting a head full of rot
You're self-righteous, the butt of the joke
And it's a secret, everyone knows

You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show you've shown it
You know you know you know you know it
You show you show you show

Like a friend to me, like you seem to be
You think I don't see
You backstabbing me
Not the enemy
Just a memory

My dear enemy, backstabbing me
Like a friend to me, like you seem to be
You think I don't see
You backstabbing me
Like a friend to me
My dear enemy
