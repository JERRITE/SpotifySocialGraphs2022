​she’s all yours Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heard you got a girl and she's so beautiful
And you still hit my phone when you should be moving on
She don’t do what I can 'cause she don't understand
’Cause she don't like the bands
No, she don't like the bands you grew up on

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my number saved
Under your brother's name
You got my number saved
'Cause you still talk to me
But you think she don't know
[Chorus]
You got a girl with a body
Why you even want me?
Why you even want me, love?
You got a girl with a body
Why you even on me?
Why you even calling me, love?
She's fucking beautiful
So fucking beautiful
So why you still calling me up?
Why you still call?

[Verse 2]
If your baby knew, what do you think she would do?
You fucked up me and you, don't you fuck up this, too
’Cause if you think I’m 'bout it
You should know I’m not about it
That I'm so not about it
You should go, goddamn

[Chorus]
You got a girl with a body
Why you even want me?
Why you even want me, love?
You got a girl with a body
Why you even on me?
Why you even calling me, love?
She's fucking beautiful
So fucking beautiful
So why you still calling me up?
Why you still call?

If you think I'm ’bout it, you should know
That I'm still not about it, you should go, yeah
She's fucking beautiful
So fucking beautiful
You say she doesn't mind

[Chorus]
'Cause you got a girl (You got a girl with a body)
Why you even on me? (Why you even on me, love?)
You got a girl with a body
Why you even on me?
Why you even calling me, love?
She's fucking beautiful
So fucking beautiful
So why you still calling me up?
Why you still call?

[Outro]
'Cause if you think I'm 'bout it
You should know I'm not about it
That I'm so not about it
You should go, goddamn1Embed
