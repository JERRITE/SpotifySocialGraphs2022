How Ya Kno Lyrics[Intro]
(Smoke)
She say that she in love, in love, baby, how ya know? (Uh, uh, uh)
Top, It's Lil Top
Uh, uh, uh, uh, baby, where you go?
(Skrrt, skrrt, vroom, vroom, skrrt, skrrt)

[Chorus]
She say that she in love, in love, baby, how ya know?
She say, "'Cause I think about you every time me and my dude fuck"
I say "I fuck with you, don't mention love"
Cause baby you should know
I just love this money, my diamonds and foreigns
[Verse 1]
She like "Slimeto I need some shoes, can you send me some?"
Hell nah, babygirl that's rude, please do not be disrespectful
She like, "Youngboy I got a question, can you tеll me somethin'?"
She likе "if I do anything you want, can I be your main one?"
Hell nah, thats aggravatin', catch me when I'm perculatin'
Let her know I had that placement
Wanna be me thats impersonatin'
All these nigga be perpertratin', check my watch thats Rollie skatin'
All these niggas just act like satan
'Til a real demon baby catch 'em and face 'em
Catch me in that turbo, I be swervin'
All these god damn drugs babygirl'll think I'm workin'
Fuck or not gon' let me fuck? Just say it it cause I ain't flirtin'
I got five grand for you after don't ask me nothin'
Say I'm stingy, fuck it

[Chorus]
She say that she in love, in love, baby, how ya kno?
She say "cause I think about you every time me and my dude fuck"
I say "I fuck with you, don't mention love"
Cause baby you should know
I just love this money, my diamonds and foreigns

[Verse 2]
I say you igging me, your aggy
Bored as fuck so catch me in the room upside down on the mattress
I keep losing on 2k so I just switch it and play Madden
Or play Call of Duty, this my call of duty
Check out how I do it
I stand on slime allegiance, that money times two it
I'm like Johnny Cage, you see my clan ain't phased
Hold up, but let's play a game (Okay, what it's called?)
It's called blow your brain, whip that blicky out
She say "fuck no, boy you insane!"
I can't leave the house but still I got my diamond chains on
I got diamonds rings on with a AP on my arm
Wet that boy then clean it up, nigga I'll get your stain gone
If you love me let me fuck, then sit down and learn this song

[Chorus]
She say that she in love, in love, baby, how ya kno?
She say "cause I think about you every time me and my dude fuck"
I say "I fuck with you, don't mention love"
Cause baby you should know
