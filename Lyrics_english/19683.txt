Thatâ€™s Him Lyrics[VENUS]
You know the way you feel when there is autumn in the air
That's him, that's him
The way you feel when Antoine has finished with your hair
That's him, that's him
You know the way you feel when you smell bread baking
The way you feel when suddenly a tooth stops aching
Wonderful world, wonderful you
That's him, that's him

He is as simple as a swim in summer
Not arty, not actory
He's like a plumber when you need a plumber
He's satisfactory
You know the way you feel when you want to knock on wood
The way you feel when your heart is gone for good
Wonderful world, wonderful you
That's him
You could shuffle him with millions
Soldiers and civilians
I'd pick him out
In the darkest caves and hallways
I would know him always
Beyond a doubt
Identification comes easily to me
Because that's he

You know the way you feel about the Rhapsody in Blue
That's him, ah, that's him
The way you feel about a hat created just for you
That's him, that's him
You know the way you feel when the fireflies glimmer
The way you feel when overnight your hips grow slimmer
Wonderful world, wonderful you
That's himYou might also likeEmbed
