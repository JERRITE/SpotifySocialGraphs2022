[RYAN AND KELSI]
It's our last chance to share the stage
Before we go our separate ways
High school wasn't meant to last forever
It's our last chance for us to shine
To bring you music one more time
So come on, come on, come on

[ENSEMBLE]
Come on, come on, come on
[RYAN AND KELSI]
Come on, come on, come on

["Now or Never"]

[CHEERLEADERS]
W-I-L-D, Wildcats
You know you're on
W-I-L-D, Wildcats
Come on, come on
East High boys, hey
Let's make some noise, oh, yeah
W-I-L-D (Yeah), Wildcats
Now's the time

[WILDCATS, CHEERLEADERS]
(Wildcats!)
This is the last time to get it right (Go, Wildcats!)
This is the last chance to make it our night (Hey, Wildcats)
We gotta show what we're all about (Team!) (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!)
Work together (Wildcats!)
This is the last chance to make our mark (Go, Wildcats!)
History will know who we are (Hey, Wildcats)
This is the last game, so make it count (Go, go, go, go!)
It's now or never, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[SHARPAY]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
I got a lotta things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's comin' soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens, I know I've got you
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
...Even if we're miles apart
...Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart!
