Sight for Sore Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh!
Going downtown, going down, going down
Neath the city, eating ground round
Underground is pretty gritty
I turned the screw she held the light
That's when I knew she was a

[Chorus]
Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes[x3]
[Verse 2]
Playing no fair, sleeping under stairs
Downtown's a pity, taking fair square
Never where it's pretty gritty
I turned the screw she held the knife
Oh holy Jesus

[Chorus]
She's a sight for sore eyes
(Oh she's a nitty nitty nitty)
You a sight for sore eyes
(Oh...she's a nitty gritty)

[Verse 3]
Turn in style
Walk a mile for your titty
Naked foul while under there
Underwear that's pretty gritty
Hey, don't you know people
She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh, she rust me
Dear old girl

[Chorus]
She was a sight for sore eyes but she was sitting pretty
Sight for sore eyes she was a nitty gritty
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
You might also like[Verse 4]
Peeled back and parted
Even in the car
It was delight or demise
I'm living like a leopard king

[Chorus]
Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes[x12]Embed
