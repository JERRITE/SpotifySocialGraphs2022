TranslationsEnglishSound of Walking Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been quiet aside you
While my heart in my chest shouts
Feeling silenced and lied to
But enough is enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying
You're not worth staying
[Chorus]
Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
Hit play, hit play
It's the sound of walking away

[Post-Chorus]
It's the sound of walking away
It's the sound of walking away
It's the sound of walking away

[Verse 2]
I've been drowning inside you
While my love, it just pours out
I've been running behind you
But enough is enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying

[Chorus]
Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
Hit play, hit play
It's the sound of walking away

It's the sound of walking away
