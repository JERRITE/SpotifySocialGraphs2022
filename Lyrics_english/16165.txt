July Lyrics[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus]
I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten over something you said
I've been holding back tears while you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one, but I can't move on (Oh, I)

[Pre-Chorus: Leon Bridges]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus: Leon Bridges]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone who gives you all of the things I could not know
'Cause I keep fighting all the ways
I let you down so I can stay

[Bridge: Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges, Both]
If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go
And, baby, I'll go

[Outro: Noah Cyrus & Leon Bridges]
You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stayYou might also like3Embed
