Mom... It’s Not A Phase Lyrics[Intro: Boobie Lootaveli]
Ayy, Spock, you slid on this ho

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
New chop on the block, push your face back (Pop-pop-pop)
Big bully mode, big bag, let me take that (Gimme that)
Mini Drac' spinnin' blocks, let 'em sing some' (Pop, pop)
Bitch, I can't cum, too much Percs got my dick numb (Haha)
Pushin' on the foreign, this a big body (Skrrt)
AR-15 with a drum, shootin' anybody
[?] got one, my neck froze (Hahaha)
Seven figure stuntin', EDD boys can't get close (Hahaha, no)
1942 and some Ricky boots (Hahaha)
Smell like some Reds and YSL when I walk through (Walk)
If I leave a bitch, know she fell off (Haha)
Big choppa on me, so you know I'm knockin' heads off (Grrah, pop, pop)
[Chorus: Fat Nick & Kxllswxtch]
He say he want highs, I'ma sell him lows (What?)
Unupgradeable, let a bitch know (Bitch know)
Drank got me leanin', call mе Sleepy Joe
I'm a one-of-one, shorty, makе a bitch glow (Bitch glow)
He say he want highs, I'ma sell him lows (What?)
Unupgradeable, let a bitch know (Bitch know)
Drank got me leanin', call me Sleepy Joe
I'm a one-of-one, shorty, make a bitch glow (Yeah, uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kxllswxtch]
Posted in your bitch bed, I'ma break some'
Shawty turnt up with a dick in her face, uh
Lasers aimin' at your crib like a ray gun
Said he want static, okay, let it bang on sight
Flatline, heads get to rollin' like dice
Green light, put a band on his head like Mike
Pop that pussy for me like glass in the sprite
Magneto with the pistol, put the metal to his mind
You ain't fuckin' with me, came to suck me like a Dyson
Park it like a [?] Mike Tyson
Come here, lil' bitch, I'm feelin' horny, like a bison
Send him to the sky, he goin' ghost, poltergeist (Bitch, bitch)

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
He say he want highs, I'ma sell him lows (What?)
Unupgradeable, let a bitch know (Bitch know)
Drank got me leanin', call me Sleepy Joe
I'm a one-of-one, shorty, make a bitch glow (Bitch glow)
He say he want highs, I'ma sell him lows (What?)
Unupgradeable, let a bitch know (Bitch know)
Drank got me leanin', call me Sleepy Joe
I'm a one-of-one, shorty, make a bitch glow (Bitch glow)You might also like1Embed
