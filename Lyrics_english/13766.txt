TranslationPortuguês 日本語 Deutschenglish Telepathy Lyrics ["Telepathy" letter]]

[Chorus]
Who would say it could
Make love for telepathy
The moon is full, my empty bed
What I would do to you
If I had you head on, the mind would fly it
At night and day, night and day

[Verse 1]
You know i'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private planet
We are connecting kilometers
And I get on even if you are not touching me
You know i drop a lot to say
There are voices in the background of my brain
And they tell me everything you are thinking
I imagine what you are already machining
[Chorus]
Who would say it could
Make love for telepathy
The moon is full, my empty bed
What I would do to you
If I had you head on, the mind would fly it
At night and day, night and day

[Verse 2]
You know that i can see right This
I can read your mind, and can read your mind
What You Wanna Do?
It's written all over your face, Times two
'Cause i can read your mind, and can read your mind
I Can Hear Your Thoughts Like A Melody
Listen While You Talk When You're Fast Asleep
You Stay On The Phone Just To Hear Me Breathe
(ON REPEAT)

[Chorus]
Who would say it could
Make love for telepathy
The moon is full, my empty bed
What I would do to you
If I had you head on, the mind would fly it
At night and day, night and day

(You know i drop a lot to say)
(All these voices in the background of my brain) 92embed
