You're always on my nerves and you always have been
Drop the beat and let 'em sing the lyrics like my last bitch
Yin yang bitches mixed up like emotions
My life is a funeral, I'm the reason you show up
I remember pain flowin' through your voice when (Voice when)
You found out I don't love you, I love choices (I love choices)
I don't ever fall asleep, I can't find sleep
Me and Lil Tracy, f- that's the nigga
Selling dog food so I know you catching boy bands
Junkies swingin' from the trees, my niggas call 'em Tarzan
I don't ever think I drove without contraband
GBC, I'm ridin' for my doggies like a triad (Mackned)

Black rain, locked doors
Can't ask for more
Can I sleep on your floor? Black clothes on tour
Mackned and Lil Peep, GBC punkstars
I don't think I'll ever need to go back to sleep
You will never know what you really meant to me
Rip my jeans, split my pills into three
For me, please, baby, can you help me bleed?
Nobody, yeah, nobody
Can make me feel like you do
Nobody, yeah, nobody
Baby, life ain't fair and I know I ain't there, oh
