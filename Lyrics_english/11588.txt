Interstate Vision Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wrap your arms around me
I’ll be still
If it means nothing I could give it up
And then give it all again

[Verse 2]
Interstates are not what I want
Headlights scare me into visions
I saw an angel fly on bright white wings
Guiding me home
[Chorus]
Can you feel me now?
Do you know me yet?
Can you feel me now?
Do you know me yet?

[Verse 3]
Call me back on Saturday when I’ll be done
Looking out for it is all I do
Did you know it 'cause we’re older now?
We were young, oh, I was so young

[Bridge]
Still I sit with you in parking lots
Acting like I’m not falling for it
Still I sit with you in parking lots
Acting like I’m not falling for it
Still I sit with you

[Chorus]
Can you feel me now?
Do you know me yet? Ohh
Can you feel me now?
Do you know me yet?

[Outro]
I saw a meteor burn through the skyYou might also like2Embed
