Ultra Sol Remix Lyrics [Lyrics for "Ultra Sol Remix"]

[Pre-Caro: Paloma Mami & de la Ghetto]
Today is one of that 'day' that I feel alone at home
Sad because being pending to you makes me bad (it makes me bad)
I will upload a couple of history 'as if nothing happens to me
Super sad see you with another on Instagram (Instagram)
This is one of that 'day' that not everything goes well
But I prefer to feel back (Remix)

[Chorus: Feid]
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything
[Verse 1: feid]
I turned on a Bareto and read your conversation
Reading what he told me, everything stopped me
No one fills the emptiness you leave in my room
What a hue that I dedicated to you again another song
I don't know if he will call or if he will answer
I only know that I have `` and to cooled—
Someday I know that you will miss me
If you are going to call without a ropita per camera
Pa 'see you to'a
Baby, dogs also fall in love
If you never got out of my cora
Is that you dance 'in a way that causes you to have you and touch you

[Verse 2: Polimá Westcoast]
And here I am without ata'o
Using a phillie alone and crown
What is the use if it is not 'to me?
For you the day connects
Pending cel, pending you
Pending if you go up a story
Pending to see if alone is' happy
And how is it 'here

[Pre-car: Polimá Westcoast]
Today is one of those day 'that I feel alone at home
I here sad because I saw you in history
I will upload a couple of history 'and I will write to you at the WhatsApp
Super sad see you with another on Instagram

Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything

[Verse 3: Paloma Mami]
Ultra alone, ultra rica
You lost a kitten path
Now I live the damn
Who takes me from the street?
'Toy Curá' of fright like a blicky
Combine to 'pink like Hello Kitty
In a bichipute the mini rises
Today I am 'pa' forgot the feelings
But lately when 3 a.m. fall
I would like to call you although I know that it is not convenient
The nights are cold 'even if I find me among the people
Dad

[Choir: Paloma Mami, Paloma Mami & Polimá Westcoast]
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything
[Verse 4: Pailita & de la Ghetto]
Today I feel alone, I feel in a desert
It is a nightmare, but being awake
Without you I am sad, and with you happy
Time passes slow, maybe it wasn't the time
I still remember that 'night' that was' dancing
And you at the disco was' looking at me
They put the song that I listened to crying
You were my escape, 'I wish you wishing you
At night missing you
On the disc there were a thousand and I thinking
With that face you are tempting me
Although I know that he is damaging me, Yeah
Pure poetry 'At night I would dedicate you
And even knowing that you would harm me
I don't feel alone, I have another one that is company
And she fulfills what you promised me
Your kisses know my honey
I want to touch your skin
I want you to 'my wife
I don't want her to go to sell
My sincere love can offer you
Miremo 'together' the sunset while
I want you to be 'My Champions (OH-OH)

[Verse 5: from the ghetto]
Super mega ultra alone
And I can't give you unfoolow
They say that man 'do not cry
For that ass cry
Ba-Baby Girl, I feel sad
Since you left, mommy, I don't leave the dispent (oh-oh)
Seeing the photo you uploaded
And now I stop the video 'making fitness
Is that now I look for you for New York City
I just causing a miti miti here
And mixing alcohol with the Picky-Pick
Mommy, let me try even a quicky

[Bridge: De la Ghetto]
Return now, it hurt
You love me ', ma, I think so
If you don't turn ', this fell
If I see you with him he died
Return now, it hurt
You love me ', ma, I think so
If you don't turn ', this was screwed (This is the remix)

[Chorus: from the ghetto]
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything
And here I am, ultra alone
Thinking that you changed me for another
Thinking about how we lost everything
Thinking about how we lost everything, oh4embed
