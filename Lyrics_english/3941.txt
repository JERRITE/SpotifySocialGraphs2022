Mad About Bars Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
So, this is the definition of givin' the streets what they want
You asked for it
(It's Foreign Kash, baby)
Let me deliver it
410, Crashers, AM, Skengdo

[Chorus: AM]
Bally on when I step right, left, right and then left
Would’ve thought his friend was a opp
'Cah he left his bredrin for dead
Oui, oui with the nine or sku-du-du with the .10
Ayy, sku-du-du-du-du-du-du-du for them
[Verse 1: Skengdo]
Kick down doors
Think again, you mug
Du-du-du-baow, might kick down yours
My plug gives me the loudest bud
Chip that smell like yours
C4, Baghdad, FB, 4T, the fours, we been on tour
The fans on my back, I like that though
Vids, we're givin' them more
Shit then, crazy, mad up, mad up
Get splashed, bro, open your thoughts
Switchin' sides, how many times? I swear down it was like four
And they sendin' man across the road
Quiet down, you don’t wan' beef 4's
Feds on my back, they know we’re breakin' the law

[Verse 2: AM]
Man just love talk shit, get shot
Man's doin' up goals on the paigon block
Girls love me and I love them not
'Cause I ain't got time on my hands, that's long
Crash don't dance, man, you must be lost
Man two-two step, or I one-two bop
Can I get a two one wings in a box?
That's a one-two meal for a two-two don
Trap hard, you ain't got no prof'
Man crossed the road when I diligent bop
OT, put my hands on rocks
Nine-to-five 'cause I'm on my job
Feds came to my door at one, try ask if I bun that don
Shit then, I don't speak English, "Non, j'étais à la maison"

Smoky, smoky
I love the elephant zoots
Better move from me, you ain't my G, no, you ain't gettin' no two's
Fuck a ID, it's straight on sight if I don't recognise you
Ratt, ratt, that's bro, bro, gonna start steppin' on yutes
GD out the can, the opps dem scared
Yeah, he was pressurin' yutes
No food in your belly, your armpits smelly
Plus you was steppin' in Loubs
When you hear that bang, just know it's gang
Suttin' like bombs on tubes
Everyone raps, everyone bangs
More time, I don't know these yutes

[Verse 4: AM]
Get man down if he don't comply
Back man's blade, tryna take man's eye
Back man's friend 'cause I back my guy
And it breaks my heart when a man don't ride
Crash, crash at a next man's house
No love for a yute if he runs his mouth
See I love this life and I love this baow-baow
Switch off a next man's child
Man run up in blocks like they ain't got lifts
Man's deep in the pond, tryna catch some fish
Let me put it like this, they were never on piss
And they're stabbin' up kids and I'm sick of this shit
Man, I'm sick of these lies
Man just pull up and fry, GD, that's bro, can I get that pole?
Man pull up and pull up and sku-du-du, bye
[Chorus: Skengdo & Kenny Allstar]
Bally on when I step right, left, right and then left
Would’ve thought his friend was a opp
'Cah he left his bredrin for dead
Oui, oui with the nine or sku-du-du with the .10
(410) Sku-du-du-du-du-du-du-du for them

[Outro: Kenny Allstar]
410 business, 2Bunny
You know like that?

Let's close the curtain in style
You know we had to give the streets two
Can't leave with just one
AM, Skengdo (Swear that's JM double 0), let's take it in, man
[Part II]

[Pre-Chorus: Skengdo & Kenny Allstar]
Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, don't gimme no chat
Oh shit, haha, ayy, tell them
Xin Zhao Xin, that’s samurai Y.AM
Drill business, damn

[Chorus: Skengdo]
Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, don't gimme no chat
Blacked out, blacked out, blacker than Blackz
Xin Zhao Xin, that's samurai Y.AM
Real talk, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, kinda stinks, it's mad
Beef? Who? Where? Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth 'fore the ting gets backed
Ayy, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, don't gimme no chat
Blacked out, blacked out, blacker than Blackz
Xin Zhao Xin, that's samurai Y.AM
Real talk, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, kinda stinks, it's mad
Beef? Who? Where? Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth 'fore the ting gets backed

[Verse 1: Skengdo]
See the ting get backed
Leathers go on, no face, it's mad
How can you switch and think you're bad?
Was a bitch back then, still a bitch in your gang
Runnin' away, you was screamin' out, "Nan"
410 fiddy, C4, that's 'dads
Better strap up, you don't wan' be a dad
Feel sorry for the kid, his dad's broke and it's mad
Ayy, sweetness, come over 'ere
Whine up your waist and bring it all back
Back it up, just back it up, don't worry, I won't tell your man
Ayy, sweetness, come over 'ere
Whine up your waist and bring it all back
Just back it up, just back it up, don't worry, I won't tell your man
Skeng get dough, better know that's man
Three rounds, that's bro and he served them packs
Remember that day when we caught that guy
He pissed himself and you know that's facts
Man over there tryna say that we're jarrin'
When you was out, still weren't in them flats
Throw up C's, CG crashers
F Blocker, yeah, we come from from 'dads

[Verse 2: AM]
Skengdo, why you so rude?
Dip man's chest 'til the blood turn blue
Sparkz done shaved up a eediots head
He was upset 'cause it didn't go through
Sku-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-do
See a one ting like, "Hello, boo"
She was all peng, she was all cute
I ain't that buff, I'm a average yute
And I know I'm a average don
But still, I was mad as hell
Now I feel like Chucky, I just need my Annabelle
Sky News, buck-buck, BuniD just rang a bell
Came home lookin' fucked up
Now your mum wished that she had a girl
Gas guns, what's wrong with these fake yutes?
Chat, chat, dem ah chat 'nuff
Chat wass and he ate two, eight, two that's eighty-two
Times five, now we're onto you
Or nine, nine that's eighty-one, plus forty-seven, plus twenty-two
Mathematics, just addin' up
Y.AM sav, just stab him up
C’est la vie, c’est la vie, très bon, that's patterned up
Ayy, man charged up like fully, Buzz Lightyear and Woody
Like old school, you get hoodied
Man, cross the road, you'll get bullied

[Chorus: Skengdo]
Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, don't gimme no chat
Blacked out, blacked out, blacker than Blackz
Xin Zhao Xin, that's samurai Y.AM
Real talk, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, kinda stinks, it's mad
Beef? Who? Where? Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth 'fore the ting gets backed
Ayy, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, don't gimme no chat
Blacked out, blacked out, blacker than Blackz
Xin Zhao Xin, that's samurai Y.AM
Real talk, don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth, kinda stinks, it's mad
Beef? Who? Where? Don't gimme no chat
Shut your mouth 'fore the ting gets backed
