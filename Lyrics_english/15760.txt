Make love with another lyrics [lyrics of "make love with another"]

[Verse 1]
Dawn with him
It is not the same as being with you
Not that it's wrong, not even talking about
But he lacks maturing, he is almost a child

[Verse 2]
White as yogurt
Without that bull that you carry in the chest
Flower fragility
Nothing to do with my favorite perverse
[Pre-Car 1]
Without your nails scratching my back
Without your hands that squeeze me, everything changes
Without your tongue poisoning my throat
Without your teeth that torture and sweeten, I feel nothing

[Chorus]
Make love with another, no, no, no
It is not the same thing, there are no pink stars
The pores of the body do not distill
Ambrosia dotted with you
Make love with another no, no
It's like doing nothing missing fire in the look
Mishans
And feel that you can reach heaven

[Verse 3]
I wanted to forget you with him
I wanted to avenge all your infidelities
And it came out so badly
That it is hard for me to breathe its same air

[Pre-Coro 2]
The strands of your curly black hair
Your sharp and drained hips
That beard that scrape like sandpaper
And your twisted smile are the best in my life
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Make love with another, no, no, no
It is not the same thing, there are no pink stars
The pores of the body do not distill
Ambrosia dotted with you
Make love with another no, no
It's like doing nothing missing fire in the look
Mishans
And feel that you can reach the skybed
