Keep It Simple Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been deep down in the dirt for some time
Not a clear sound from my heart or my mind
'Cause his words are clinging on for dear life
But I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I'm breathing
You got body and my knees, they go weak
Lie awake and read your sext, I can't sleep
I wish I wanted what you want, not yet free
But I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I'm breathing

[Chorus]
Let me keep it simple
So I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call
'Cause I ain't ready for ya
Let me keep it simple
So I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call
'Cause I ain't ready for ya
[Post-Chorus]
I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready
I ain't ready, I ain't ready

[Verse 2]
I go to bed with you, but dream about him
You think I want to? No, I hate that he wins
Hard to forget how fucking broken I've been
But I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing

[Chorus]
Let me keep it simple
So I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call
'Cause I ain't ready for ya (I ain't ready, I ain't ready)
Let me keep it simple
So I don't have to face ya
Let it be just my call
'Cause I ain't ready for ya (I ain't ready, I ain't ready)

[Bridge]
Physical to trick your heart
You are moving on
Physical to feel okay
That's what people say
Physical, I better try
So this ain't goodbye, oh
Physical to trick your heart
You are moving on (I ain't ready)
Physical to feel okay
That's what people say (I ain't ready)
Physical, I better try (Oh, oh)
So this ain't goodbye (No, no)
(Let me keep it simple)
Physical to trick your heart
You are moving on
Physical to feel okay
That's what people say
(Let it be just my call)
Physical, I better try
('Cause I ain't ready for ya)
So this ain't goodbye
(I ain't ready for ya)
