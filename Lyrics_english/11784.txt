Every time lyrics [letter of "every time"]

[Intro: Junior H]
Ey, mommy, we are far
But so close, so close
Listen to this

[Chorus: OVI]
Every time you come and go
I don't know, but it feels strange
And at the same time we want pleasure
Knowing that you can hurt us
We can never see each other
It always has to be
In hidden 'in the bathroom
Every time you leave and come
I don't know, I feel that a thousand years go by
[Verse 1: Junior H]
The day has 24 jewels
With you I want to be 25
Mommy, let's go now
I'm tired 'to see you alone on Instagram
And it is not normal, this feeling bad
Baby, you follow my plan, just come
I want to touch you, baby, your eyes look
Your beauty admire, baby, eat you
Time may separate our bodies
But not feelings, woman
This hurts us, we spend the fuck
I know you can't see me

[Chorus: Junior H]
Every time you come and go
I don't know, but it feels strange
And at the same time we want pleasure
Knowing that you can hurt us
We can never see each other
It always has to be
In hidden 'in the bathroom
Every time you leave and come
I don't know, I feel that a thousand years go by

[Verse 2: OVI]
They spend a thousand years
And millions of memories inside the bathroom
I feel that time does not pass, the house feels alone
The hours day 'and the days seem years, uoh, Yeh
And when it is' alone, it is touched alone and that is getting down there, yeah, uh
And she is crazy, but I am the only one to place it

And he left, and left me
The pantis pa 'do not forget her, and I
Baby, I didn't bot, keep them in my heart
And if this is sin, then God forgive us
And he left, and left me
The pantis pa 'do not forget her, and I
I did not bot, keep them in my heart
And if this is sin, then God forgive us

[Choir: Ovi & Junior H]
Every time you come and go
I don't know, but it feels strange
And at the same time we want pleasure
Knowing that you can hurt us
We can never see each other
It always has to be hidden 'in the bathroom
Every time you leave and come
I don't know, I feel that a thousand years go by
