Secrets Lyrics ["Secrets" letter]

[Enter: Bryant Myers & Miky Woodz]
Six in the morning, drinking coffee (hahaha)
Like the color of your eyes (I miss your madness')
Where devil love was?
If I gave you everything (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
I miss seeing you without clothes in the room (Yih)
I have secrets that I do not share them
I keep your love in a bottle
Your photo in a frame, baby, tell me something
I miss seeing you without clothes in the room
I have secrets that I do not share them
I keep your love in a bottle
Your photo in a frame, my world is bitter
[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
The baby that I want is you, you was ’my lu '
I feel like a déjà vu
You have me listening without flag by YouTube
Maybe ours was only a love of youth
For me it was so deep and so high
Everything ours fell through a ravine (ravine)
Baby, I loved you so much (I loved you so much)
And of our history only blank leaves were left

[Saying: Bryant Myers]
In secret, I still want your heat
Have you to make love to you
And I realize that there is no better
That erase your smell, let my pain take away

[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Miky Woodz]
I miss seeing you without clothes in the room
I have secrets that I do not share them
I keep your love in a bottle
Your photo in a frame, baby, tell me something
I miss seeing you without clothes in the room (Yeah-Yeah)
I have secrets that I do not share them
I keep your love in a bottle
Your photo in a frame, my world is bitter
(Baby, let yourself be carried away by OG)
