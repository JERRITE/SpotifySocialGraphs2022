Playful (All Star Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "Playful (All Star Remix)" FT. Kendo Kaponi, Pusho, D.Ozi, Anonimus, Juaka "El Problematik", Young Izak, Almighty & Bryant Myers]

[Intro: Kendo Kaponi]
Revere

[Anonymus]
Playful that tangles me in your game
And it burns in your fire
And I am not afraid
Today I want to see it again
Without finding the old man
[Young izak]
Do not speak of love
That does not speak of feelings
He doesn't want anything serious
Without repentance
It only seeks entertainment

[Chorus] (Yomo & Young Izak)
Playful a flirtatious
Gets drunk and ends with me
Playful sexy geek
It is released if you put a Nasty dog
Playa Piki Kitty
Leave her friend and end with me
Sexy toy
It is released if you put a Nasty dog

[Verse 1] (Push)
I'm married and doesn't care
Because my baby does not behave
He likes my toy and it's not short
She does not believe in the love
Pop fourth put the light off
And take out the powers of the PowerPuff
The bottles unfortunate
If fire turns on as torches
It makes me pieces under the quilt
Because she is the one who decides
He tells me in the ear do not forget
That I like sex and at the same time asks me
You might also like it does not speak of love that
Nor come with stories
Because it is not serious pa
Is tired of boredom
That violent man likes
(Push!)

[Choir] (yomo)
Playful a flirtatious
Gets drunk and ends with me
Playful sexy geek
I am the one that I make the panty wet you

[Verse 2] (Juaka el Problematik)
Playful bounces all that you have back
And with a lot of skill in the cai rice
Baby how pretty you see
Come pa that you try and that Botty moves

You make me lose your reason
To give it no instruction manuals
You have to work by section
The change of position deported the armchair
Bathroom to the balcony
I am a path to perdition
We do not leave evidence and handle that ass
I have a license
You call me urgently
Because I'm bad influence
In bed it is an experience with experience

Knows how to drive me out of my way
And with that bumper I will collide
You tell me yes in your body land
It's not how to do it is that when I do the system I paralyze me

[Verse 3] (Bryant Myers)
Dale plays the microphone and inton
But a day with acetone is thrown out
I take out a bana
And you are going to move the buttocks like Madonna
Doing it listening to my songs
A lot of smoke in my lungs
Know that I am the best that puts it to you
It never composes me always proposes me
To the latter was that I do not use more condoms

Playful plays with my toy
And tonight mom wants to
It is a Tretona knows that I have 17
But I am the best to put

[Choir] (yomo)
Playful a flirtatious
Gets drunk and ends with me
Playful sexy geek
It is released if they put a perreo nasty

[Verse 4] (Almighty)
I have a playful baby
That he likes to turn around my area
She hungry and I eat it that eats it
Faced you have the buttocks and stops stops
Mr. Horn's Horn
Because she sticks them to married

I don't know the life on which it is based
But put my matter if the rule is late
My always lately late mind
Nobody wants to run on the lane that runs this derailed (Almighty!)
Equal friends I speak clearly
I take some pairs he does not want to uninstall
They shout at me soft that it hurts and shouts hale
And I crazy about getting through you and opening the channels

[Verse 5] (D.OZI)
Playful playful
It texts me, I do not answer and get pissed off
I have another culona online
The album is filled as table bottles
You are the MAI of the children of the capo does not interest me
You know you run without flip
How to get his arm in full express with the glitter
We chiche and kiss me
FÃºmano a strawberry crack
And Victoria Secret is wet as a dam

Leave that
You like these lack of serum
But with weight
And I am like prison cheese
I'm going to eat you as self -expression toll

[Pre-car] (yomo)
Do not speak of love
That does not speak of feelings
He doesn't want anything serious
Without repentance
It only seeks entertainment

[Choir] (yomo)
Playful a flirtatious
Gets drunk and ends with me
Playful sexy geek
It is released if you put a Nasty dog

[Verse 6] (Kendo Kaponi)
Ito ito la cat that that humito
I leave her by driving the Humito
I grab her by the hair and shout him
I put the buttock and shout
The flow is worth killing the mosquitoes
While dreaming 300 women who brought the stork
I crap the hair for the use when I stamped me
I get hard and I shook me
From the bed Pal soil and ahh la demuelo
I write everything that month and live
Back I grabbed her
The viro, La Amarro
How is playful inside the car
I apply the punishment
To the chickens eat wheat
I don't fatigo
I eliminate them with a bar that compresses
I break the raw material
And they stay with the wolf that defines

[Verse 7] (yomo)
She doesn't want me to punish Tigue
To take it and the dome
That the last time
And yomo eats it
Playful condemnation does not intimidate in intimacy
Play with me in the dark
With me will end intimacy

Uguetona Tona Gatica or tight roncona
As if it was talk about the deton
Sweet putona puts on my Amazon area
Problem is being shown and puts automatic
The lights turn off your diabla on your back giving you table
Playful folds with your eyes up talks to me
I make it very hard made very slow
We did everything we did little was that we wanted
I have it in the sight since I arrive
None looks at her how I look at her
I female playful na na
Kill how Na Na walks
It has a murderer na picket
In the corner I corner me
It is no longer missing that I kill me in intimidadembed
