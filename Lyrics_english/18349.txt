So Pretty Lyrics[Intro: HoodCelebrityy]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, HoodCelebrityy)
So pretty (Oh)

[Chorus: HoodCelebrityy]
Baby, so pretty
What's your nationality?
Hair black, eyes brown, good quality
You're so pretty, you don't even follow me
Message you in the DM but you leave the shit on seen
You're so pretty, you don't even need IG
Them bitches do it for the likes, but you do it for me
You're so pretty
Real, real so pretty (Mmm, yeah)
[Verse 1: HoodCelebrityy]
You don’t need no broke nigga
Your body sick, so you need six figure (Six figure)
Real housewife, cook lunch and dinner
And you still fuck like a champion winner
High school diploma, yeah you graduate and you bad (Mm)
Step up on dem, watch how yuh mek gyal mad
You're bad and you're bougie
Never backstage, never acting like no groupie
She only smoke blunts while she listen Lil' Uzi
Yeah, you're real picky and I like how you choosy
Take care of your son, fuck that nigga, he a goofy
He'll never catch a vibe like you (Like you)
He don’t know them right, that pussy tight like you (Like you)
Everything official, they are not like you

[Chorus: HoodCelebrityy & Kash Doll]
Baby, so pretty
What’s your nationality?
Hair black, eyes brown, good quality
You're so pretty, you don’t even follow me (Ayy)
Message you in the DM but you leave the shit on seen
You're so pretty (Kash Doll), you don’t even need IG
Them bitches do it for the likes but you do it for me
You're so pretty (HoodCelebrityy, yeah, yeah)
Real, real so pretty (Mmm)

Look, ha, femme fatale
Bossed up, bad gyal
Skin soft, likkle shape but a cocktail
I got my own, I don't owe these niggas
I don't fuck 'em, I don't suck 'em, I just bro these niggas
It's a foreign whip when I'm slidin'
Y'all just test driving
Real life, my new crib, two point fivin'
A black goddess, these niggas is novice
My kitty been litty, you bitches just getting started
And I'm mixed with Franklins, Grants and Jacksons
Got no feelings like I only fuck with tooth extractions
I'm always on some savage shit, exclusive extravagance
Get the money, flip the money
Double up, I'm stacking it (Mmmm, weh mi say)
I'm having it

[Refrain: HoodCelebrityy]
He'll never catch a vibe like you
He don’t know them right, that pussy tight like you
Everything official, they are not like you

[Chorus: HoodCelebrityy]
Baby, so pretty
What's your nationality?
Hair black, eyes brown, good quality
You're so pretty, you don't even follow me
Message you in the DM but you leave the shit on seen
You're so pretty, you don't even need IG
Them bitches do it for the likes, but you do it for me
You're so pretty
Real, real so pretty (Mmm, yeah)

[Chorus: HoodCelebrityy]
Baby, so pretty
What's your nationality?
Hair black, eyes brown, good quality
You're so pretty, you don't even follow me
Message you in the DM but you leave the shit on seen
You're so pretty, you don't even need IG
Them bitches do it for the likes, but you do it for me
You're so pretty
Real, real so pretty (Mmm, yeah)1Embed
