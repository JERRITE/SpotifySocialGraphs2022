Toes Across the Floor Lyrics[Verse 1]
Doesn't anybody feel
That all these killers should be killed
And all these healers should be healed
So all these beggers can be filled?
And now, tell me, why am I to lie
If I'm holding firm and feel the right

[Chorus]
To lie beside this dog of mine
And let that perverted thought really run through my mind?
Through my mind
[Verse 2]
I'd scrape my toes across the floor
This day's the same as those before
And though, inside, I'm feeling giddy
Always wrong for never giving myself that un-invaded door
So, now I'll take a little glue
I'll put together a new glittered room for view

[Chorus]
So I can start sitting so pretty
Instead of sitting here not seein' clear
Just sitting here, not fittin' here
No, things ain't fittin' here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'll just lay my head down beside this God of mine
And let that perverted thought burn a hole in my mind
And if I can't lay my head beside this God of mine
Maybe the hunter's dog called God
Could be my friend, in timeYou might also likeEmbed
