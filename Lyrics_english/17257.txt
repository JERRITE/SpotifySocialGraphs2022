Move To The Music LyricsWell, alright!
Yeah, yeah!

I'm in the mood
It's time to go out tonight
You're feeling good
Pulsating, going faster
Than the speed of light, yeah, yeah

I feel it touch me, oh, don'tcha know
That it's never loud enough for me
You've got to move to the music
You've got to live on rock and roll, yeah, yeah
You've got to move to the music
Don'tcha know it's good for your soul

Yeah, yeah!

Out on the town
Saw this girl, she looked so fine, ooh...
I'll tell ya now, oh, I love it
When I feel her body movin'
Close to mine, yeah, yeah

I feel it touch me, oh don'tcha know
That it's never loud enough for me
