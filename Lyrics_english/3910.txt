JUST BE ME LyricsDoes anybody hear me
When I'm talking
A thousand things
That's on my mind
Do people even
Care about the voice inside
I’ve tried and tried
To be everything that I could be
I'm just screaming
At the top of my lungs
Don't know why
Tell me why I never did it for me
Imma just be me
Who
Imma just be me
Who
Imma just be me
Can anybody see us
While we chasing the lights
Again again I'm losin’ my mind
And why is it always pictures
Of a perfect life
I’ve tried and tried
To bе everything that I could be
I'm just scrеaming
At the top of my lungs
Don't know why
Tell me why I never did it for me
Imma just be me
Who
Imma just be me
Who
Just let me be
Imma just be me yeah
Imma live my life for me for me
There's no one I'd rather be
Imma just be me
Beautiful world
Beautiful life
Just live it like a fantasy
Didn't know I would be alright
Didn't know I’d feel so right
I'll be alright
There's nobody else
I'd rather be
I'd rather be me
Imma just be me
Who
I know
Why not just be me
Imma just be meYou might also likeEmbed
