Chemistry Lyrics[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
So pour another drink cause Lord knows you need it
She says I'm confident her homegirls say conceited
I got a girl in every time zone every different season
And look I don't respond to calls and I don't have a reason
Drinks on ice, bars on heat, just tonight, girls on me
Niggas fall, they call on me, we got some blunts I brought some weed
Lets grab some girls and let them know
And if they iffy let them go
Got some things I need to do
And got some moves I need to make
I want the frosting and the cake
Be there in 5 you know I'm late
I'm trying to smash, no dinner dates
I've seen that ass I've been amazed
I just wanna fuck with ya fuck with ya
I just wanna talk to ya talk to ya
[Hook: Blackbear]
I'm feelin' all these chemicals
Its always fucking up my flow
I tell you what you wanna hear, right now
I'll tell you when you need to go
You fucking up my chemistry
Supposed to be just you and me
I guess it wasn't meant to be, yeah
Fucking with this chemistry

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
Popped a pill at nine and shit started getting blurry
I kiss you on the cheek and
Told you I was in a hurry
I was racing
Self conscience, I was worried
I don't know why
Sometimes the drugs control me
I get money for clubbin, I get pussy for loving
We get blackout at pregames
And more black out at functions
I know I came from nothing
But we, we gonna be something
I could put that on my momma, make an album start the drama ah
Get home safely, this world is crazy
Mano y mano, rappers won't take me
Women they love me, their boyfriends hate me
One of a kind, there's no replacement

I'm feelin' all these chemicals
Its always fucking up my flow
I tell you what you wanna hear, right now
I'll tell you when you need to go
You fucking up my chemistry
Supposed to be just you and me
I guess it wasn't meant to be, yeah
Fucking with this chemistry

[Bridge: Skizzy Mars (Blackbear)]
(Chemistry x10)
My world is born
You turn me on
My love is strong
Your heart is torn
My world is born
You turn me on
My love is strong
Your heart is torn

[Hook: Blackbear]
I'm feelin all these chemicals
It's always fucking up my flow
I tell you what you wanna hear, right now
I'll tell you when you need to go
You fucking up my chemistry
Supposed to be just you and me
I guess it wasn't meant to be, yeah
Fucking with this chemistry7Embed
