If you are not lyrics [letter of "if you are not" ft. The ghetto]

[Intro: Nicky Jam, from the ghetto]
(UOH, UOH, UOH, UOH)
I don't fear loneliness (no, no)
If I was born alone, and you threatens me, hey (eh, hey, yeah)
And if you think you're going to see me cry
I will not give that taste
I think I'm better
Big up
Nicky Jam, from La Ghetto
Rude Boys on Fire
[Pre-stribe: Nicky Jam & de la Ghetto]
They say that time heals
Your memories are taken by the wind
None of this will import
They say that time heals
Your memories are taken by the wind
None of this will import

[Chorus: Nicky Jam & de la Ghetto]
If you are not, I'm not going to cry for you
While I'm forgetting you
I continue to rumbe, life I will live
If you are not, I'm not going to cry for you
While I'm forgetting you
I continue to rumbe, life I will live

[Verse 1: from the ghetto]
Vo 'to continue on mine, looking for a new path
Forgetting the problem ', I'm going to enjoy mine
The tear 'and all your melodrama' are over '
No one left you, you were the one you left, uh
Now it's my turn to rumbar
And with my shock and live life, baby (uh)
And I don't care what I can think
I'm not going to suffer because you long

And if you tell me that you are leaving
I am alone and that is better
To be with someone who doesn't love you
I know that another gives me the value
And if you tell me that you are leaving
I am alone and that is better
To be with someone who doesn't love you
I know that another gives me the value

[Chorus: Nicky Jam, from the ghetto]
If you are not, I'm not going to cry for you
While I'm forgetting you
I continue to rumbe, life I will live
If you are not, I'm not going to cry for you
While I'm forgetting you
I continue to rumbe, life I will live

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
I will not cry for you
I remember those days as you made me go from bad
And I can't stand one more day suffering
I want to live life as I didn't live
Because my time has arrived, ma '
I no longer feel na ', that's what it's just begged
And see now who play
I no longer feel na ', now you will enjoy, Yeah

They say that time heals
Your memories are taken by the wind
None of this will import
They say that time heals
Your memories are taken by the wind
None of this will import

[Chorus: Nicky Jam, from the ghetto]
If you are not, I'm not going to cry for you
While I'm forgetting you

While I'm forgetting you
I continue to rumbe, life I will live
