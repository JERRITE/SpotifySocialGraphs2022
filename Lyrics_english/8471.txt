Living at Lyricsletra war of "Living at War"

Living in war
Seeing how they fall, fall, fall and not get up
Those who believe that respect in this land are implanted
Let's see who survives in this mother war
In this damn war
Living in war
Seeing how they fall, fall, fall and not get up
Those who believe that respect in this land are implanted
Let's see who survives in this mother war
In this damn war
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
That cut of yours is to give a more than a cortoo
By slender you have the days count, (one foot to the boat)
And I am ababo the amontao, wow don't make me malcriao
Still chiguagua you are barking the chauchau
Leave the picheo that now if you are chi ...
The one of the cake pa that you call your babalao
Speaking of course you live giving foul
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
Now the Pichon Kiere throws the Guaraguao
Did another foul and pa la Puetao voteo
You have been thinking about Pojaros Preao
I am a guerreo and you are a Boyscout
I already tired of so much that I have roliao
Moving like crazy, that we have good toast
What you pretend Guerriaria Caripelao
What is your kieres who breaks your face?
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
And they are named
And looking for a name
If you want to kill me, they can
You a fool to pitcher point me another out
This is Big Liger Kedate in Dogout
Wow es-ta lendoo, do not look for a k.o
In this shit .. cn all I guerreao
Rather I have hesitated them
I sakan chest until I have been snorked
But from the front none have touches me
Hectoe the Father
Bad Boy
If you follow the same blablabla and blah
Ronkando, pa after calling to fix
I know are you, even though they are with a mask
Bad Boy
Meka the new threat
Notty decide
I am read pa uds
Remember that this is my hobby
With this it is born, this is not bought by the extras
LOL
You heard .. Hohyte
