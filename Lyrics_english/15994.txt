Jailhouse Rock Lyrics[Verse 1: Ashleigh Murray]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard them knocked-out jailbirds sing

[Chorus: Everyone]
Let's rock everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
[Verse 2: Madelaine Petsch]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus: Everyone]
Let's rock everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 3: Camila Mendes]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus: Everyone]
Let's rock everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 4: Ashleigh Murray]
Sad sack was sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, "hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"

Let's rock everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5: Madelaine Petsch & Camila Mendes]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's lookin' now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix, Nix
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks"

[Chorus: Everyone]
Let's rock everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

[Outro: Ashleigh Murray, Madelaine Petsch & Camila Mendes (All)]
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
