Keep On Dancing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm at my birthday party by myself
I only got one card up on a shelf
From my mama
I made myself a cake with sweet icecream
Got strawberry in it they say that's the dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'mma put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from left to right
I'mma put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from day to night
[Chorus]
And I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until my feet wear thin
And I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until the beat kicks in
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing, dancing
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Yeah, I'mma keep on dancing

[Verse 2]
I've never been one for a big parade
I guess weighing solo always feels the same
Maybe better
A couple hours left to celebrate
And then I'll sleep my little fears away

[Pre-Chorus]
But first I put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from left to right
Yeah, I'mma put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from day to night

[Chorus]
And I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until my feet wear thin
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until the beat kicks in
Yeah, I'mma keep on dancing, dancing, dancing
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Yeah, I'mma keep on dancing

Wish it was the way it was
A fleck of gold, a colour rush
The music stops, the world erupts
I wanna dance, turn the speakers up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'mma put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from left to right
I'mma put my records on
Play my favourite songs
Move my hips from day to night

[Chorus]
And I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until my feet wear thin
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Until the beat kicks in
Yeah I'mma keep on dancing, dancing, dancing
I'mma keep on dancing, dancing
Yeah I'mma keep on dancing
I'mma keep on dancing
I'mma keep on dancing
I'mma keep on dancingEmbed
