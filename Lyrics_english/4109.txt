Scave with me Lyrics ["Scap with me" ft. Ozuna]

[Intro: Wisin, Ozuna]
(Ozuna)
(W)
It will be the magic that your eyes have
And those tricks to fall in love
You seduce me at will
And I can't escape from your spell
What do I want to look for you (Aj√°)
And to kiss you again (baby)
As much as they try to get away
Baby, today with me you're leaving
(I just want you to trust me and be brave, baby)
[Choir: Ozuna & Wisin]
Scave with me (Yeah) tonight, baby (aha)
I want to eat you (a lot 'kisses), you will love it (Yeh, Yeh)
You know that you always have a good time (you pass it well)
I want to eat you (baby), your lips kiss (hey well)

[Post-Coro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Baby, don't say no (no, no, no)
If we are only you and me (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
And your skin bristles (your skin bristles)
When we get into heat
Baby, don't say no (no, no, no)
If we are only you and me (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
If your skin bristles (your skin bristles)
When we get into heat (bathed in sweat)
Lords, the powerful

[Verse 1: wisin]
My supernova (heh), the one that a smile steals me
Tremendous wolf, just a kiss and heat the bedroom
He sticks to me and I do not bother
The baby is a panther, I am his casanova (heh-heh)
Scave with me (pa-pa), where there are no witnesses (pa-pa)
If they ask you, tell them I'm your best friend (pa-pa-pa)
I want a kiss, you want punishment
You know I don't force you
I wish you, I always tell you
(Mamita, leave the window open)

Scave with me tonight, baby
I want to eat you, you will love it (Yeh, Yeh)
You know that you always have a good time (you pass it well)
I want to eat you (baby), your lips kiss
(I really don't know what he has)

[Bridge: Wisin & Ozuna]
Is that I want a little more (a little more)
Of your rich nudity (of your nakedness)
Is that the sweat of your skin (of your skin)
It is the one I want to try (princess)
Is that I want a little more (a little more)
Of your rich nudity (of your nakedness)
Is that the sweat of your skin (Yeah)
Is the one I want to try
Baby, we walk with the powers
Ozuna

[Verse 2: Ozuna & Wisin]
My mind uncontrolled
And if I call her, she tells me to look for her, that she is alone
There is no time, but doing so is not delayed (Yeah)
And if I fail, what a calm, because he does not fall in love
Calm, life with me hesses you
I have not seen another baby from your league
Those kisses that make me want
Of dawn with you every morning
(At two in the morning I am at home)
[Chorus: Wisin & Ozuna]
Scave with me tonight, baby (aha)
I want to eat you (it's just that), it's going to love
You know that with me you always have a good time
I want to eat you, your lips kiss

[Post-Coro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Baby, don't say no (no, no, no)
If we are only you and me (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
And your skin bristles (your skin bristles)
When we get into heat (bathed in sweat)
Baby, don't say no (no, no, no)
If we are only you and me (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
If your skin bristles (your skin bristles)
When we get into heat (bathed in sweat)
