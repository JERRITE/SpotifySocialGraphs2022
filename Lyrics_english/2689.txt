Good Vibes Lyrics [Text by "Good Vibes" ft. Gemitaiz]

[Intro]
Yeah
Eh, eh, eh, eh
3D, baby

[Verse 1: nayt]
Ah
Look at me, a year ago I was poorer
It changes little if I'm just more comfortable
I shoot with the flow, bang, turn your stomach
They say they rap: the rhymes go on strike
I say they do tecktonik like, stupid dances
Rappo like Tech N9ne, go to Fantculo, immediately
You give you only bad vibes, I'm fucking the audience
You call me, I don't answer
But I'm not busy, not me you 'nculo
Rome Spacca, my dialect in Fimi
I don't detach from the wall, write
I go off with a bro
I make myself two rockets, beers, sometimes even two wines
Mene fuck how they do in the north
I spread the seed where my flow goes
If your girlfriend is suddenly pregnant
And you wonder if you are the father, I don't know
I will do the gold disc, but I won't be hostile
I have, meat on the fire, stuff to roast
I didn't see you little, I just didn't see you
There is no man if he doesn't have style
Yes, I'm good, yes, I'm calm
Sea view, I'm hating you the same, haven't you seen?
Give me the dish, even what you waste
You don't make me a fuck, like the one you smoke
[Pre-Cirnelello: Nayt]
Eh, Bro, but how are you?
Well but I have, always trouble
Rest, among the good vibes
Where, I don't know, high flight, where you know

[Refrain: nayt]
Where you know, oh
Flight like never
Look where they are, and look where you are
Rest, among the good vibes
I am as I am
Flight, I will never change, eh

[Verse 2: Gemitaiz]
You want to fuck me, but the flow goes away
Goals, Serie A, when I go down with William, call your daughter
I do a soap opera, (Woof) Dobermann
I turn a barrel that burns like the hunchback of Notre Dame (Ah)
Multiplatino but without refrain (Ah)
You have become yellow as the limoncello (ah)
I'm armored, pull me a knife
My Language Load shoots, friar ', is like an iron (*bang*)
So I sing
They are a car that goes to rods and alcohol
All made, with eyes as in Bangkok
In Rome I became a saint
Uh, what was 2006? (Yeah)
Good vibes with mine, with G in K-Way
I keep her, beautiful firm, for the ponytail
Work every day man, no Holiday (hello)

Eh, Bro, but how are you?
Well but I have, always trouble
Rest, among the good vibes
Where, I don't know, high flight, where you know

[Refrain: nayt]
Where you know, oh
Flight like never
Look where they are, and look where you are
Rest, among the good vibes
I am as I am
Flight, I will never change, ehembed
