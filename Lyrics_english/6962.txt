Never The Right Time Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, eh eh, yeah
Can I hold ya?

[Chorus]
I could hold you down
But, it's never the right, never the right time
We could change things now
But, this isn't the right, it's never the right time

[Verse 1]
Round and round, music's loud
Feeling a little drunk of that look in the side of your eyes
You and me were just cool
But, I rather be on you not the passenger side
You just broke up your hell
And I'm back with someone new
If we had more time in the same zone, he could have been you
[Chorus]
I could hold you down
But, it's never the right, never the right time
We could change things now
But, this isn't the right, it's never the right time
Never the right time
(never the right, never the right time)

[Verse 2]
Here we are, in my place
Would invite you up, but we know how this shit might go down
I'm twisted, confused
And I really want you
But I don't want to ruin what we have now
I could play songs, talk to you all night
Day after day
You lean over, kiss my cheek goodbye
I have no words to say

[Chorus]
I could hold you down
But, it's never the right, never the right time
We could change things now
But, this isn't the right, it's never the right time
Ooh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
(never the right, never the right time)You might also likeEmbed
