TranslationsEspa√±olMyth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drifting in and out, you see the road you're on
It came rollin' down your cheek, you say just what you mean
And in-between, it's never as it seems

[Chorus]
Help me to name it
Help me to name it

[Verse 2]
If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
What comes after this momentary bliss?
The consequence of what you do to me
[Chorus]
Help me to name it
Help me to name it

[Bridge]
Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows fallin' from the sun
Canyon callin', would they come to greet you?
Let you know you're not the only one

[Verse 3]
Can't keep hangin' on to what is dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
Materialize or let the ashes fly

[Chorus]
Help me to name it
Help me to name itYou might also like50Embed
