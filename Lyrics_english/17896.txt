Telephone (remix) Lyrics [letter of "telephone (remix)"]

[Verse 1: Lele Pons]
Here is that this ends
A bit of your own medicine
Do not come to look for me
I'm not going to answer you
Now they are things about life
Know that everything has its end
Don't come to cry, that's why
[Chorus: Aitana, Lele Pons]
Today I left my phone so as not to call you
Not to call you, not to call you
Today I left my phone so as not to call you
Not to call you, to forget you

[Verse 2: Aitana, Lele Pons]
An easy loss call is forgotten
You can continue, keep praying
You can continue, keep lying to me
I will not continue, keep believing you
I want to be calm let me breathe
I upload a photo and you look at her once
But you will suffer for your lies

[Chorus: Aitana, Lele Pons, both]
Today I left my phone so as not to call you
Not to call you, not to call you
Today I left my phone so as not to call you
Not to call you, to forget you

[Post-Stribillo: Aitana, Lele Pons]
Oh oh oh
Not to call you (not to call you)
Oh oh oh

Only when it rains you are looking for me
Only when there is cold scares yourself
You know your fort is to apologize
You know that deep down I am right

[Chorus: Aitana & Lele Pons]
Today I left my phone not to call you (not to call you, no)
Not to call you (not to call you, no)
Not to call you (not to call you, no oh, oh)
Today I left my phone (today I left, oh)
Not to call you (not to call you, no)
Not to call you, to forget you (to forget you, Oh, Woah)

[Post-Stribillo: Aitana, Lele Pons]
Oh oh oh
Not to call you (not to call you)
Oh oh oh

[Outro: Aitana, Lele Pons]
Ah ah ah ah ah)
Not to call you
