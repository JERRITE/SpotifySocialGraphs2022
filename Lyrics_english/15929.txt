To whom you decided to love Lyricsahora I have no more doubt that your love
I already ended up, it hurts but it ended
It's difficult but not impossible
Assimilate that I really lost you
And now I see you leave

And although time passes
And be happy with someone else
Remember that there is nothing
Make me forget about you, I know ...
Whom you decided to love
I don't know if you know that there are no people
Like you here on Earth
I promise I do not cry again
I know how happy they are and take care of
What I dreamed and always wanted to me

With heart ... love

I know how sad I can get to be
Because at least I try but I don't win
The person who has the
Access to your heart, see what blessing
I could have been

And although time passes
And be happy with someone else
Remember that there is nothing
Make me forget about you, I know ...

Whom you decided to love
I don't know if you know that there are no people
Like you here on Earth
I promise I do not cry again
I know how happy they are and take care of
What I dreamed and always wanted to me
You Might Also Likesi had a chance
I would exchange the end to everything
But I couldn't because
The truth is like you are
With me in eternity and I understand
You weren't for me but I will always love you

And although time passes
And be happy with someone else
Remember that there is nothing
Make me forget about you, I know ...

Whom you decided to love
I don't know if you know that there are no people
Like you here on Earth
I promise I do not cry again
I know how happy they are and take care of
What I dreamed and always wanted to me

If I had a chance
I would exchange the end to everything
But I couldn't because
The truth is like you are
With me in eternity and I understand
You weren't for me but I will always love you
With heart ... love1embed
