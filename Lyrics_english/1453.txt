Risk It All Lyrics[Intro]
Jacquees
What?

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I was cool being your rebound
Love when we creepin' round
He ain't gotta know about us
I ain't tryna do too much
Baby lemme give you just enough (Give you just enough)
You're safe with me now
Come to my safehouse
And lemme put the pressure on you
And let me put that body on tuck (Tuck)
Give you good sex, that lovin' (Lovin')
[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
I know you a rider, girl, what you desire?
I could take you higher (I could take you higher)
From the game make me retire, you should be my final
Walking down an aisle

[Chorus: Jacquees]
No, we ain't gotta talk about it, don't talk about it
I'd risk it all about you
I'm standing tall behind you
If you fall, I gotcha
No, we ain't gotta talk about it, I'ma walk about it
I'd risk it all about you
If you're lost, I'll find you
Rip them panties off you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Oh no, baby, you got me focused on your body
Come on and put this ladi-dadi in the air
I'm sittin', them vibes beside me up in there
Got all of these vibes, but baby, all of my eyes are on
You and your body, movin' all too exotic
Got me havin' withdrawals, like what I'm gon' do without it?
You sexy lil' baby, you be drivin' me crazy
Only thing on my mind is gettin' back to my baby (Yeah)
Shawty, the way you make me feel
Got something on your sex appeal (Sex appeal)
Let's have sex, keep on them sexy heels
And then let's just chill
