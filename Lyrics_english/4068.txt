Happy birthday lyrics [verse 1: Anahí & Christian]
Something special prepare you
I know you will surprise yourself
On this birthday
I will eat your heart
You will see how bad I will behave
To your friends I linked me
On this birthday
I will try to make it the worst

[Chorus: RBD]
I no longer want you to feed me more love
While you cheat me for no reason
That is why this farce is already over
Bye Bye, Happy Birthday
[Post-car: RBD]
Ooh, sha-la-la-la-la
Happy birthday, happy birthday

[Verse 2: Anahí & Christian]
I know I'm going to stain
But you have been the same
And on this birthday
I will eat your heart

[Chorus: RBD]
I no longer want you to feed me more love
While you cheat me for no reason
That is why this farce is over
Bye Bye, Happy Birthday

[Bridge: Anahí]
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday

[Chorus: RBD]
I no longer want you to feed me more love
While you cheat me for no reason
That is why this farce is over
Bye Bye, Happy Birthday
I no longer want you to feed me more love
While you cheat me for no reason
That is why this farce is over
Bye Bye, Happy Birthday
