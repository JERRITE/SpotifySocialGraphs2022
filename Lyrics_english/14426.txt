Hello?

[Verse 1: Chyno Miranda, Ricky & Mau]
Let's make a Deal
What if you and I do not dedicate it to me?
Be very clearly the two that we need it
Let's try
We are in time to recover, Yeah
I haven't talked to us for a while (Yeah-Oh, Oh; BRR)
Thing as simple as saying that I need you (Woh-Oh; Yeah, Yeah)
I know I neglected you (Oh, Yeah)
And if I failed, I apologize
I want to do well, oh
[Chorus: Chyno Miranda & Ricky]
My love
You have always been the one that moves the floor (Yeah, Yeah)
Beautiful woman, I want to be with you
Let's solve while we make love, love (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chyno Miranda & Mau]
Listen to me, calm, rela
What if with me reveals'
Even if it's eight sorry '?
You left my cold heart
Only in the river and you took the guardianship
Tonight you are 'more' beautiful, it's 'more' beautiful
That delicious mouth
They don't call me Wilfrido
But I can give you even a rose garden (roses)
Because my last name with your name (Yeah)
And I am the one who knows you the most (Yeah; Wuh)
I eat you wherever, whenever and whatever
I'm ready for Remix, Oh, tell me where, Yeah
