Bass down low - performed by the cataracs LyricsIf you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots
Of Patron I give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
Wanna get your mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'

(The Cataracs)
Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
G-give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
(To the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
(To the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast and my bass down low

Can I get a little Goose in my OJ?
Every day feel like my birthday
And we sip champagne when we thirsty
Quit frontin', why yo' husband
Tryna get his mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'

(The Cataracs)
Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
G-give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
