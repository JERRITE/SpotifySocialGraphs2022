Dybala Lyrics ["Dybala" ft letter. Valy, Mayky & Prod Sane]

[Enter: Kevis HP]
YAH-AH-AH (SANE)
Kevis, Mayky, Valy

[Chorus: Kevis HP]
Everyone throws me but none matches me
They want to win me but they never win
They want to get my flow, but my flow does not compare
I have the left of Messi and I am a jewel like Dybala
They are like a coin, because they are all double face
Everyone throws me but none matches me
They want to win me but they never win
They want to get my flow, but my flow does not compare
I have the left of Messi and I am a jewel like Dybala
They are like a coin, because they are all double face
[Post-Stribillo: Kevis HP]
They are word ', but not tanta
They throw and throw but never endure
If you want my style, ask it to Santa
If I get a good subject, these are frightened

[Verse 1: Valy, Kevis HP & Mayky]
They look at me from afar stand up, look at me closely and don't know what to do
You are eleven and here we are three, if you are going to throw me ere 'the number one hundred
And now everyone becomes friends, if my friends are unknown
We will be on tour in the United States so you know about trap, trap, trap
And now everyone becomes friends, if my friends are unknown
We will be on tour in the United States so you know about

[Bridge: Kevis HP]
He wants him to invite her to cinema, for her everything is Business
I want to go out in Guinness, of every being the winner, I'm going to be a leader
On the side of mine they are in the Kinder, there is no rest or weekend '
I already got bored, I increased their level, that to be where I am they have to upload it

[Verse 2: Mayky & Kevis HP]
Everyone looks at me, they are inspired by me, how difficult it is to live like this (like this)
Beverly Hills, I want to live, go to Paris, for my mommy I'm going
All 'mese' I was doing a hit
Shout-out Pa'l Sane, who put me beat (You make that?)
And now the 'eyetes want to die, I will eat thanks to you
You throw me 'and your girlfriend throws me into the DM
Nene do not speak if it does not suit you, stops, mybody stops me (no, no)
I want a life of Rockstar, I know that I will soon achieve it
I will listen to my name and my name will not be forgotten
And now I don't know what you want to offer me, I just tell myself that
