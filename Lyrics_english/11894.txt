7UP Lyrics[Verse 1]
I love it when we hang out in your tree house after dark
And when you hang my heart against the wall and play with darts
I know it's kinda sad but you're the only home I got
I promise I will love you even with my broken heart

[Chorus]
(And oh)
7UP in my red cup
Tears pouring down on your makeup
You can hold me down if you want to
I don't really mind 'cause I'd like to
Feel love, how it hurts, ah
Fire in my chest, watch it burn out
You can hold me down if you'd like to
I don't really mind 'cause I love you
[Verse 2]
Remember when we took my car and
Scratched it with our names
And I was writing poetry about you everyday
And yeah I know that things they never tend to stay the same
But I don't think you love me and it kills me everyday

[Chorus]
(And oh)
7UP in my red cup
Tears pouring down on your makeup
You can hold me down if you want to
I don't really mind 'cause I'd like to
Feel love, how it hurts, ah
Fire in my chest, watch it burn out
You can hold me down if you'd like to
I don't really mind 'cause I love you

[Bridge]
Rip the bandaid fast
So it feels right
Knife to my chest as I don't cry
7UP in my red cup
Tears pouring down on your makeup
You can hold me down if you want to
(You can hold me down, oh, you can hold me down)
You might also like[Chorus]
7UP in my red cup
Tears pouring down on your makeup
You can hold me down if you want to
I don't really mind 'cause I'd like to
Feel love, how it hurts, ah
Fire in my chest, watch it burn out
You can hold me down if you'd like to
I don't really mind 'cause I love you
I don't really mind 'cause I love you3Embed
