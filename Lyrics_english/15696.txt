Finally I armed myricschiquita value ..
I'm alone, homeless, playing background ..
In a desert, sweating cold, biting dust ..
Shouting, to my past that answers me
To understand your departure .. to cure my wound ..
So you don't screw me anymore ..

Chorus:
I get tired of waiting for you, at night, at dawn
Rogging God why you will return ..
Drinking my pain crying ..
I know you don't understand
That's why I don't want to see you again
Fuck your mother with what they think
Alfin puts me value ...
Close the door, and the windows .. of a single blow
To forget you cry of rage, like men ..
Among my dreams you appeared a couple of nights ..
Listen to your lies, start you from my life ..
I forget your name ..

Chorus:
I get tired of waiting for you, at night, at dawn ..
Rogging God why you will return ..
Drinking my pain crying ..
I know you don't understand
That's why I don't want to see you again
Fuck your mother with what they think
Alfin puts me value ...
I tired .. to wait for you
I get tired of holding so much
I tired .. to spend the nights in your mattress
I tired .. your mother ..
I tired .. of being a coward ..
I tired .. what you gave me and what I give you

I get tired of waiting for you, at night, at dawn
Rogging God why you will return ..
Drinking my pain crying ..
I know you don't understand
That's why I don't want to see you again
Fuck your mother with what they think
ALFIN I ARM OF VALUE ... YOU MIGHT ALSO Likeembed
