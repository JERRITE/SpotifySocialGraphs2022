TranslationEnglishno mirres Lyrics ["Do not look at her"]

[Intro: Ozuna & Jhay Cortez]
Woh-Oh
The Negrito Eye 'Claro'
Yeah, h
Ozuna
I don't look at it, 'I have it on this side, I already placed it (I already placed it, eh)
I threw only one wink 'and crowned
She knows what (eh-eh-eh)
Not even cuqu√© (Yeh-eh)
And here I waited for her (I waited for her)
She invited me and I arrived (the black eye 'clear')
[Verse 1: ozuna]
Always Louis, never Macy's, to 'gucci, fendi, Prada
I already crowned with a look
It was not love at first sight (first view)
But how it will be seen when devoted (deviates)
We are in high, a lot of Blackie with Sprite
Buy 'Toa' doms peri ', don't ask', there is no longer
Arrived 'on the disc, floods (ha)
Say your flow and never sink
You have a ticket, I have a cover (I have a cover)

[Saying: ozuna]
And she moves the booty with the blender (with the blender)
I give you contact about a hundred for now
A selfie with me and gives him pa 'instab (he gives him pa' insta)
To border on his 'friend'
And she moves the booty with the blender
I give contact about a hundred for now (one hundred for now)
A selfie with me and gives him Pa 'Insta (Woh-Oh)
To border on his 'little friend' (Yeh-eh)

[Pre-car: Ozuna]
She is single, left the cat
He just wants a good time and no love
If you don't have 'wallet, your rookie, rookie
That I won a long time ago and put a goal

Hey, she knows who to throw the favor (to do the favor)
Hey, baby, take a little more before the sun rises (before the sun rises)
Hey, she knows who to throw the favor (to do the favor)
Hey, baby, get a little more before the sun rises

[Verse 2: Jhay Cortez]
Yes, give it heat, Gatita asks for heat
This is a Murakami, not and 'a sunflower
She is loose, imagine with liquor
It comes out with night glasses as if sunburning
And it has that dm exploda'o (yes), 'tas throwing stone' to the moon
You know that you are picha'o, yes, you are a foul
That's back is already hackea'o
That ass kicks me as if I was weapon.
'Toy here, girl goes down from her you work'
Has 'the body kit that is new e' box
The curveadita belt without using the girdle
I get wherever you live 'in slabs
Yes, I arrived at your apartment
I always like his photo and comment
I want to eat it but here I don't e 'the moment
If it were for me, Baby, I leave it inside you (Do you follow me '?)

[Pre-car: Ozuna]
She is single, left the cat
He just wants a good time and no love
If you don't have 'wallet, your rookie, rookie
That I won a long time ago and put a goal
[Chorus: Ozuna]
Hey, she knows who to throw the favor (to do the favor)
Hey, baby, take a little more before the sun rises (before the sun rises, oh)
Hey, she knows who to throw the favor (to do the favor)
Hey, baby, get a little more before the sun comes out2embed
