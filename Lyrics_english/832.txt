Lyrics chance ["chance" letter]

[Pre-car]
Yesterday I talked about you
But cross with you today did not expect it
And if fate did not 'put here
I don't forgive 'more time, that does not come back if it ends

[Chorus]
Tell you what I want is more '
And if I look again, I will kiss you
I win the ones that I have you do not leave me alone
And this to meet again 'was not casualid'
Tell you what Qui–µro is more '
And if I see me 'to look, I will have to kiss
I win the ones that I have you do not leave me alone
And this to meet again 'was not casualid', eh-eh
[Verse]
Indicates what I do ', if this is resolved'
Baby, you accelerated me for 'after' stepping on the brake
Poisonous snake, I am immune to your poison
I bought a house, cale to see if with you the premiere
I can 'do something' that they have never done to you
For you I straighten myself and right path
Looking for you on the prowl, if I drink I confess
Vamo 'pa'l car, turn on the air and lie on the roof

[Chorus]
Tell you what I want is more '
And if I look again, I will have to kiss you
I win the ones that I have you do not leave me alone
And this to meet again 'was not casualid'

[Pre-car]
Yesterday I talked about you
But cross with you today did not expect it
And if fate did not 'put here
I don't forgive 'more time, that does not come back if it ends

[Chorus]
Tell you what I want is more '
And if I look again, I will kiss you
I win the ones that I have you do not leave me alone
And this to meet again 'was not casualid'

And if I look again, I will have to kiss you
