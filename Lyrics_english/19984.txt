“You are a bold and courageous person, afraid of nothing
High on a hilltop near your home, there stands a dilapidated old mansion
Some say the place is haunted, but you don’t believe in such myths
One dark and stormy night, a light appears in the topmost window in the tower of the old house
You decide to investigate. And you never return…”

[Intro: Louie Duffelbags]
In 2013, the first Danger Boy died
I remember his life, and his heavenly ride, and his dangerous vibe
And I cried almost every night
But then he came back to life
A Danger Boy never dies
[Verse 1: Louie Dufflebags]
Danger Boy life is lonely one, the Danger Boy life is a holy one
I fuck with you once and I fuck with you twice, can't you tell girl that you are the only one?
40 years old, say goodbye to your life
All I want is just to see you tonight
I carry my boys and I carry my knife
You don't fuck with my dick, girl, you fuck with my mind
Loving you longer than I love the internet
Boys I been rollin' with since like 2003
Runescape is the only dangerous world for me
Download the drugs and come internet soar with me
Inside your bedroom and trying to undress
Danger Boys got nobody to impress
Do this for days and I don't have to rest
Girl, I'm loving your vibe and I'm loving your chest

[Chorus: Louie Duffelbags]
A Danger Boy never dies
Oh a Danger Boy only rides into the night
Oh a Danger Boy never dies, oh, oh
A Danger Boy only rides into the night

[Verse 2: Boothlord]
Boy, oh, you're way outta line
Try me in my face one more time, then you see the god in your mind
Go on and try me my friend, my steel loves the taste of your red
I know you text her, you did, stunt on your block and your bitch
Fuck all the cops in my city, fuck all the cops in my city
I feel your heart on my ribs, you don't remember me, kid
There's no forgetting me if I make you fucking bleed for this shit
You feel the gallows and rope, hope you see God as you choke
Go feed the shadows you hold
While I sleep off the shallow you spoke
I can't be mad at these hoes, I can't be mad at these hoes
I'm the real villain, I know
I'm the one killing my hoes

A Danger Boy never dies
Oh a Danger Boy only rides into the night
Oh a Danger Boy never dies, oh, oh
A Danger Boy only rides into the night

[Outro: Louie Dufflebags]
A Danger Boy never go home
A Danger Boy only texts you when it's from his friend's phone
I fucked your girl on your tombstone3Embed
