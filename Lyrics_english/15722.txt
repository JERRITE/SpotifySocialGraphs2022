What would be lyrics [lyrics of "what it would be"]

[Intro]
What would it be like?

[Verse 1]
If it is with you that it will be
Whatever, without fear (Yeah)
If you tell me, leave me
So let it be, without fear, hmm (uh)
[Pre-Statement]
Way not knowing where to step
Where 'You're you to guide me
Until the end (uh)
If it is not always nor will
So let death come and separate us
And yet (uh)

[Chorus]
You want much more of me
What if you like that?
What would it be like? (Uh)
I give you a lot more of me
ES Manera ki n ta xinti
Like Beyoncé and Jay-Z

[Verse 2]
And correct our flaws
Without other stories
To confuse
I see written in the background
Two against the world
Without giving up
Yeh

[Pre-Statement 2]
Forget our differences
Change this conversation
Because I already know (as it would be) (uh)
How love can be blind
If we have everything to do
And I already know (as it would be)
You might also like [chorus]
You want much more of me
What if you like that?
What would it be like?
I give you a lot more of me
ES Manera ki n ta xinti
Like Beyoncé and Jay-Z (UH)

You want much more of me
What if you like that?
What would it be like?
I give you a lot more of me
ES Manera ki n ta xinti
Like Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Yeah (UH)

You want much more of me
What if you like that?
What would it be like? (Uh)
I give you a lot more of me
ES Manera ki n ta xinti
Like Beyoncé and Jay-Zembed
