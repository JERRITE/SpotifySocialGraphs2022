Colors LyricsLosing all your colors
You're fake
Yeah how you do me like that
Stab me in the back
And then I caught you running right back
I'm better off alone
I think I'm on the right track
Said I'm on my way
And I ain't trying to get this sidetracked

And they know I'm him
I'm the one
There could never be no other damn
How you turn your back
And try and call yourself my brother, man
Don't hit me on my phone
Just go and give my number back
I been in the sky
And I know that you been way under that
Just go and keep your distance
You know that I won't listen
You been lying, just admit it
I can't expect it to be different now
I know that it's just business
Went and made all these decisions now
Tell me how this shit been workin out

And you ain't even worth it now
I hope you been hurtin
How you think that I deserve this
I can't stand it, I been burnin out
My heart inside a furnace
I been dealin with these curses now
I really think I've earned this crown

Ain't no friend, I know you feaux
Fake like all the rest I know
Now your palettes start to show

Know your diamonds all CZ
Yeah your tones, I see them lack
Yeah your golds been runnin green
All your shades are turnin black

Losing all your colors
You're fake
Yeah how you do me like that
Stab me in the back
And then I caught you running right back
I'm better off alone
I think I'm on the right track
Said I'm on my way
And I ain't trying to get this sidetracked
You might also likeAnd they know I'm him
I'm the one
There could never be no other damn
How you turn your back
And try and call yourself my brother, man
Don't hit me on my phone
Just go and give my number back
I been in the sky
And I know that you been way under that

You ain't in my lane
Get up out my way
I ain't got no time
Playin all these games
I don't go that pace
Guess it never changed
Ain't no saving face
Guess you gotta take that
And run with it
I'm tired, I been done with it
You fake and I can't fuck with it
Above the bar, you under it
Been waiting with your hands out
No I ain't got nun to give
Your colors show, your rag was tucked
What you been sayin ain't addin up
Losing all your colors
You're fake
Yeah how you do me like that
Stab me in the back
And then I caught you runnin right back
I'm better off alone
I think I'm on the right track
Said I'm on my way
And I ain't trying to get this sidetrackedEmbed
