Mugen Woe Lyrics[Verse: Xavier Wulf]
You see me pulling up so mean but I'm clean though
Smokin' of the best wood you'd have never seen ho
And I don't give a fuck 'bout none of these silly hoes
I pulled off so quick she ain't even know
Hol' up
Bitch quit talking while I roll up
All black whip cuz I mixed every color
I ain't Chief Keef but it still go skuh duh duh duh
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you are
240 boys comin' though like a racecar
She said, "Xav' do you wanna go n hit the bar"
I said, "No bitch I'm only here to set the bar"
Real tall
Fuck Y'all
I don't give a fuck now
Who?
Now you can see it in her face all she wanna do is touch now
Touchdown
Lemme' smoke a blunt now
Sit down girl I don't want to hear shit now
All you lil rappers need a hit now
I don't give a shit, I can make a hit without my damn fist out
What now?
While he looking' pissed out
I can care more bout the urine that I piss out and any of you niggas with your neck out
Talkin' shit just because you canâ€™t win and you locked out
Kudos to my niggas on the clock now
Make sure you smoke a blunt as soon as your clock out
Tell the lil boy put the Glock down
Nigga
