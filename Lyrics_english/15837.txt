And if it were her? Lyrics [lyrics by "And if it were her?"]

[Verse 1]
She slips and I get hit
And although sometimes I don't care
I know that the day I lose it I will suffer again
For her, who appears and hides
That leaves and stays
What is a question and is answer
What is my darkness, my star
Nerd
She combs my soul and tangles me
Go with me but I don't know where it goes
My rival, my partner
That is so inside my life
And at the same time it is so out
[Pre-car]
I know I will lose myself again
And I will find her again
But with another face and another name
Different and another body
But it is still her
That takes me again
It never answers me
If when turning the wheel

[Chorus]
She becomes cold and becomes eternal
A sigh in the storm
To which his voice changed so many times
People who go and what is always her
That lies and denies me
That forgets and reminds me

[Post-car]
But if my mouth is wrong
But if my mouth is wrong
And when I call it I name another
Sometimes you feel compassion
For this crazy, blind and crazy heart

[Chorus]
Be, whatever God may be
My crime is the awkwardness of ignoring
There are those who have no heart
And he burns, burn and burn me
What if it was?

She combs my soul and tangles me
Go with me, I say
My rival, my partner, that's her
But it costs me when another goodbye looks so close

[Pre-car]
And I will lose it again, and I will ask again
While he leaves and there will be no answer
And if that which moves away
The one I am losing
What if that was? What if it was?

[Chorus]
Be, whatever God may be
My crime is the awkwardness of ignoring
There are those who have no heart
And he burns, burn and burn me
What if it was?

[Bridge]
Sometimes you feel compassion
For this crazy, blind and crazy heart

[Chorus]
It was? Who tells me if it was her?
And if life is a wheel
And it turns and nobody knows when you have to jump
And I look at her, what if she was? Nope
What if it was? Oh, Yeah
