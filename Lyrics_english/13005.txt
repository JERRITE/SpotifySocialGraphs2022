Better in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I saw you standing there
With the dyed-up blonded hair
They said that you had clout
I said I didn't care
When the liquor was all clear
I could see you through the glass
There's something I could tell you
But I forgot to ask

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the stars
The lighter makes a spark
But I look better in the dark
I look better in the dark
[Verse 2]
Do you think it would be weird
If I dropped into a dream?
Always the first to know
Always the last to leave
If you're sober in the morning
We can always just pretend
That you drank on your way home
And the party didn't end

[Chorus]
When the sunlight meets the dark
You'll see I'm not the one you want
'Cause I look better in the darkYou might also likeEmbed
