El Mariachi Lyrics [Verse 1: Lars Vaular]
I take off as a aviator, enter as a gladiator
Hard core tones from my clavic lies only in my nature
The capital shouted "Farmer Knoll", I just take and milk the tail of the cow
Ka fuck, man, what it was udder, enough to saturate more, I have more
I have the whole fucking made on the nap, three summers in a row, I was just on tour
Radioactive, autodidact Salviaarus
Rolls up one tea, asks Store on "Kem e number one?"
"Kem comes down fatter than average?"
Break my way through pussy, know a heavy loop on the whole shit
Gift package for the whole click, the same gang, the same slang
Do you hear the cubes bite the snake without understanding the connection?
We own it, we fix it, you rent it, you borrow it
It is strike, it is okay, we are stoning, so we dream it, I mean forgetting it
Exclamation to all my groans, exclamation to all my Genderar
Exclamation to all my people, for it is only five percent here that understands that
Exclamation to my tjommi locked down for one second, only for a while back again
NMG/G-house forever, now you can get it there the mic back again
[Bridge]
You wanted to keep it real but reality was too boring
So you wanted to keep the real little tjommi, but reality, it got too boring?

[Verse 2: Lars Vaular]
I take off as a aviator, enter as a gladiator
Hard core tea the point it takes on
Punctured myself three points below low -dimensions
Too stupid to reject suggestions, always too young to refrain from so
I understand the look you have on the look you have when you really go on
Time you require your own property and show people all the ka shit you are entitled to
Supplied tea walls as a radiator
Claim Maga on an charges, constables just stand and babs
Question as a lawsuit, hoping to nest up a red thread
Connects some cables tea together
Short -circuit circuit, the loops tightened
The masks are tied, the muscles are paralyzed
Comes to a point where everything e the same
Comes to a point between A and B
Does the ball pick up or can happen?
So, should we just let it go down or should we just let it go down?
And you think of the advice you got and you took it as a petty criticism
This was exactly what they warned about, only worse than they managed to explain it as
