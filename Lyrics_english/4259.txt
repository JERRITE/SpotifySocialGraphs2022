Tell me that Lyrics [letter of "tell me"]

[Intro]
I didn't want to speak others, but I had to do it
What you and I have I don't want to lose it
And no matter how disguise, I know you can see it
Since you arrived, my life changed

[Pre-car]
You became my need
You can't be just a coincidence
So many mistakes and so much falsehood
Only you give me security
[Chorus]
Now I spend seeing your photo, I think I wrapped myself
Although we carry very little, I already love you for me
And I notice from you, you also think like this
Tell me yes, you know I'm pa â€™ti

[Verse 1]
I am not going to deny you, without you everything does not matter
Maybe you think I'm crazy, but I can't hide
You have something that is killing me and I can not control
You calm, that in me you can trust

[Bridge]
I'm not going to shut him up, I have to accept it
Your name in my head I can't erase it
And I'm not going to shut him up, I have to accept it
Your name in my head I can't erase it

[Chorus]
Now I spend seeing your photo, I think I wrapped myself
Although we carry very little, I already love you for me
And I notice from you, you also think like this
Tell me yes, you know I'm pa 'ti

[Verse 2]
Thinking, I don't sleep quiet
Looking for you, I want you to be with me
Now I spend looking at your photo, you have me addicted
My mind is still looking for you, another like you have never seen
Wishing you are in my bed
I would like you to say yes
You know I'm dying
Tell what you feel for me
Eh, don't say no, I want to do it

Now I spend seeing your photo, I think I wrapped myself
Although we carry very little, I already love you for me
And I notice from you, you also think like this
Tell me yes, you know I'm pa 'ti
