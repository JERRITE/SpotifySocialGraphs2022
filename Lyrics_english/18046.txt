​reckless driving Lyrics[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn’t think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can’t focus on the road when I'm in your car

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Now we're going one hundred
Your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at one eighty
And I can finally see
But then it’s over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen
You’d rather die than take your eyes off me
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
I don't love you like that
I’m a careful driver
And I tell you all the timе to keep your eyes on the road
But you lovе me like that
You're a reckless driver
And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go

[Verse 2: Ben Kessler]
I don’t know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you sit shotgun
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell you
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment

[Pre-Chorus: Ben Kessler, Lizzy McAlpine]
Now we're at one hundred
My hands aren't on the wheel (Hands aren't on the wheel)
And I don't wanna lose this moment
Want you to know just how I feel (Just how I feel)
Now we're at one eighty
And I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
I don't know how it happened
Guess I'd die to keep your eyes on me
You might also like[Chorus: Ben Kessler]
'Cause I love you like that
I'm a reckless driver
And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes on the road
Do you love me like that?
If I keep on driving
Would you hold me when we crash or would you let me go?

[Bridge: Lizzy McAlpine]
Don't wanna scrape you off the pavement
I can't be your savior
I don't wanna be here when you lose control
Don't wanna watch it as it happens
See the crowd's reaction
I don't wanna be here when you kill us both

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine, Ben Kessler]
'Cause I don't love you like that
('Cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
(And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes—)
But you love me like that
(Do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver
(If I keep on driving)
And one day it will kill us if I don't let go
(Would you hold me when we crash?)
'Cause I don't love you like that
('Cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
(And you tell me all the time to keep my eyes—)
But you love me like that
(Do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver
(I'm a reckless driver)
And one day it will kill us if I—3Embed
