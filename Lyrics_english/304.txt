Shine Like Beyoncé Lyrics[Chorus: Yo Trane]
Heard you wanna shine like Beyoncé
Workin' overtime need no rest days
Haters keep throwin' shade, as always
Don't let your feelings get in the way (Brr)
Put on your lipstick, girl, it's your day (Your day)
Let them bring you down, shawty, no way
Ayy, keep your dreams alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, please don't let them die, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Yo Trane]
Get it right now
Your focus is to have a better life now
And, no, it ain't easy being broke
It's two AM, you ready for the show
Just go and get your money
Dealing with all these nonsense, criticism, judgement
Baby, you're a diamond in the rough
They just need to get to know you
Now worry about the things you do
And the truth is you have no real friends and shit
Everything's a lie and everyone's full of shit
Girl, just pop four of your buttons, make these niggas go crazy
Grind and mind your business
Try to grow up around them killers and sticks
Ain't you gotta three-year-old kid's named Rich?
I can understand the reason why you drop it low
Pickin' up all the cash after a show (Brr)
[Bridge: Yo Trane]
Put on your lipstick, girl, it's your day (Your day)
Don't let them bring you down, shawty, no way
Ayy, keep your dreams alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please don't let them die yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no time to play do it your way
These niggas love you that's what they all say
Keep your dreams alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, please don't let them die, now

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Babe, make you feel enlightened whenever I'm inside
I can be your choice of words if ever you can't decide
I'll send my chauffeur you ain't never gotta drive
Yeah she wear chanel whenever she come outside
I can turn your dream to reality
Valentino jackets like it's fashion week (Stay on fleek)
Sittin' on the floor sees like champ
You don't play with me
Feelin' like she caged in
I told her to let it free

[Chorus: Yo Trane]
Herd you wanna shine like Beyoncé
Workin' overtime need no rest days
Haters keep throwin' shade, as always
Don't let your feelings get in the way (Oof)
Put on your lipstick, girl, it's your day
Let them bring you down, shawty, no way
Ayy, keep your dreams alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, please don't let them die, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ain't no time to play do it your way
These niggas love you, baby, that's what they all say
Keep your dreams alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, please don't let them die, nowEmbed
