TranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisFallin’ (Adrenaline) Lyrics[Verse 1: Jonah Marais]
Caught in the moment, not even thinkin' twice
Everything's frozen, nothing but you and I
Can't stop my heart from beating, why do I love this feeling?
Make me a promise, tell me you'll stay with me
If I'm bein' honest, I don't know where this leads
But that's the only question, baby, don't keep me guessin'

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Seavey]
Ooh
You are my muse
I feel so reckless
Oh, you're makin' me, makin' me, makin' me give in
[Chorus: Zach Herron]
Oh, baby, I can feel the rush of adrenaline
I'm not scared to jump if you want to
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybе we'll just keep fallin'
I can feel the rush of adrenalinе
I'm not scared to jump 'cause I want you
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybe we'll just keep fallin'

[Verse 2: Corbyn Besson]
When I'm around ya, I feel it in my veins
There's something about ya that's makin' me go insane
We have a storm to weather, my little sweet surrender

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Seavey & Corbyn Besson]
Ooh (Whoa)
You are my muse (You are my muse)
I feel so reckless
Oh, you're makin' me, makin' me, makin' me give in

[Chorus: All]
Oh, baby, I can feel the rush of adrenaline
I'm not scared to jump if you want to
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybe we'll just keep fallin'
I can feel the rush of adrenaline
I'm not scared to jump 'cause I want you
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it
Maybe we'll just keep fallin'
