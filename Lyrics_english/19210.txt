Take it to Da House Lyrics[Intro]
Get down
Yes, sir (Uh-huh, uh-huh, get—)
Slip-n-Slide Records (Get down)
Uh, finna take it to the house (Get—)
Just get on up and get down

[Verse 1: C.O.]
Callin' my peoples all across the world
This song goes out to all the boys and girls
You want them thugs to come and turn your party out
You better take it to the house, (C'mon, uh, uh, uh), c'mon now
[Verse 2: Money Mark]
Yes sir, Slip-n-Slide get loose
More punch than your bowl of juice
And ain't nobody more jiggier than us
Stuff so ruff it causes head rush like what?
Give it to me, bring it here
Don't stop, girl, shake it here, shake it there
Let Money Mark get off in your derriere
We off the chain for the whole year
So if you look good with a big ol' butt
Lived in your own crib and make your own bucks (Yes, sir)
Hit me up, treplus.com
And tell me where you from, uh

[Verse 3: J.V.]
Smoke out, choke out, we get
Off the chain like we just broke out
You don't know bout me J. Dot?
When I come though all the haters get hot
'Cause I got more hoes, more dank
More cheese in the bank, more rank
My dawgs on dubs, yours ain't
My dawgs do whatever, yours can't

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we them niggas that's gon' make you
Get up out your seat and get down
You might also like[Chorus]
We don't play, we take it to da house
MIA, take it to da house
This the way we take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to da house
305, take it to da house
Boy, we got that fire, take it to da house
Slip-n-Slide, take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to the— take it to da house

[Verse 4: Trina]
Okay, play with it, yo, it ain't no stoppin' it
S-N-S and we rock-rock-rockin' it
We gon' lock it and do our thang
'Cause my dream team takin' all the rings
I got Tre+ who beats too much guts, and, uh
Duece Pop', pimpin' news non-stop and
Lost Tribe to my side just vibin'
And J.V. gon' ball with me
T double D, he off in Excursions
Swervin' all on the curb with a virgin
And I'm Trina, you heard my name
I'm still the baddest, ain't a damn thang changed

[Verse 5: C.O.]
Now it's time to get down with your boy C.O. 
It's me, Money Mark and the big freak show
Niggas recognize, hoes do too
When I creep through the room with the Slip-n-Slide crew
Gimme room, 'cause I'm buck wild, man
I'll get you crunk, get you loose in the stands
Tre+ and we're runnin' it still
Funk Boogie, spin the wheel
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we them niggas that's gon' make you
Get up out your seat and get down

[Chorus]
We don't play, we take it to da house
MIA, take it to da house
This the way we take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to da house
305, take it to da house
Boy, we got that fire, take it to da house
Slip-n-Slide, take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to the— take it to da house

[Verse 6: Trick Daddy]
Order two more bottles of Crissy-Cris'
And get drunk pissy while you listen to this
All you rookie-ass niggas, don't try the shit
Some busta-ass niggas can't buy a hit
Gimme a break and a beat I can vibe with
A Nick Quest video and a fine bitch
'Bout fifty-five spins and a mic check
And, yo, play my shit
I never had sex that costed
I fuck so much, I'm exhausted
And this new shit I'm flossin'
I got that 'cause I'm bettin' with the Dolphins, huh
Slip-n-Slide finna take it to the house
New hot shit for you to ride out
And for the niggas that tried, there was nothin' left
Your ho must think we somethin' else
Fuck fame, we out to get paid
Born and raised in the County of Dade

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we them niggas that's gon' make you
Get up out your seat and get down

[Chorus]
We don't play, we take it to da house
MIA, take it to da house
This the way we take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to da house
305, take it to da house
Boy, we got that fire, take it to da house
Slip-n-Slide, take it to da house
Take it to da house, take it to the— take it to da house
