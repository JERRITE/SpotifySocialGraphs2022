WOW (Unplugged) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Said I'm tired of little money 'need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flocking 'need a decoy
And I'm mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix
G-Wagen G-Wagen G-Wagen G-Wagen
All the housewives pulling up
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumping Fall Out Boy
You were talking shit from the beginning
Back when I was feeling more forgiving
I know it piss you off to see me winning
[?] when I be grinning
[Chorus]
Hunnid bends in my pocket it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up got 'em saying "wow"
Hunnid bends in my pocket it's on me
Yeah your grandaddy probably know me
Get more bottles these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up got 'em saying "wow"

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo
750 Lambo in the Utah snow
Truck in the front like the shit Dumbo
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some good luck
Turn the kitchen counter 'to a strip-club
Me and Bae came for that
When I got guap all of y'all appeared
Before I moved here none of y'all really cared
Now they always say congratulations to the kid
This is not a 40 but I'm pouring out this shit
Used to have a lot but I got more now
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now
Always going for it never punt fourth down
Last call Hail Mary Prescott touchdown
You might also like[Chorus]
Hunnid bends in my pocket it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up got 'em saying "wow"
Hunnid bends in my pocket it's on me
Yeah your grandaddy probably know me
Get more bottles these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up got 'em saying "wow"Embed
