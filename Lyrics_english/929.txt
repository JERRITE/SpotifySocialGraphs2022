Now don't say no, don't be done, Yeh-eh
Baby, don't get (OH-OH)
If you already know 'Who am I

Now don't say no, don't get (don't be done, mommy)
Baby, don't do you '(do-hagas, mami; yeh)
[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Jory Boy]
Better tell me that you miss me
That you are crazy to do it with me
Baby, I know you love me '
Ask for it, the navel is taken inside '
Better tell me that I miss me '

Baby, I know you love me
Bellaca puts you to 'listen to my voice (huh, eh, h)

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
What do you do 'You are not going' to forget (no, no)
You are alone and Bellaca, you are going to think (Yeh)
Baby, don't try to fall in love (Wuh)
That none 'and these goat' will replace me
I know you miss how I gave it to you (I gave it)
That what he bought was Gucci or Prada (Gucci or Prada)
To a bastard life was' accustomed (Wuh)
Now is' with that fool who doesn't give you anything (no, no, no)
You are going to be mine forever, I condemned you (Skrr ')
You miss' this bug like Denise strange that of René (UH)
As JLo strangers that of Marc (Yeh)

(Says, hot)
It has been looking for me for weeks
It is tired of the guy that
I told you that this was going to happen
You can't 'replace me anymore, no
'Tá desperate, it called me like the do'
He rented a motel in Caguas pa 'that gives him punishment
Pa'l fuck the boyfriend, I turned on the lamb 'and came to him
I wanted me to rescue it and take it pa 'use

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
Better tell me that you miss me
That you are crazy to do it with me
Baby, I know you love me
Ask for it, the navel is taken inside '
