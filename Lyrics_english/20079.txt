Stabbed Her to Death Lyrics[Intro: Zheani]
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death

[Verse 1: Zheani]
In the stealth of the night I’ll slit you slow like a knife
No pain, no fun
Show you the time of your life, I can see it in your eyes
Despite your cries of silence, wildin' out and getting violent
I’m the fucking devil's bride, bitch
[Verse 2: Cameronazi]
Stabbed her to death, kick in your chest
Losing your breath, feeling of death, feeling of death
I can’t run, you can’t hide
Fuck with me, you can’t hear me
I’m inside

[Verse 3: Zheani]
If you’re all snakes why are you spineless as shit?
I’m a human - not a ladder death adder and shit
I went down on a bitch, dripping she snitched
Down on a bitch, jabbed like a shiv
Stabbed her to death

[Chorus: Zheani]
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death
Stabbed her to death, stabbed her to death

[Verse 4: Cameronazi]
I can’t fucking take it, tied to the pleasure and pain
I can’t fucking take it - demons, they drive me insane
You don't make any fucking sense
Can’t handle all this stress (Let me out)
Voices in my head, don’t make me feel any less
(Let me out)

[Verse 5: Cameronazi]
Stabbed her to death, kick in your chest
Losing your breath, feeling of death, feeling of death

[Verse 6: Zheani]
Stabbed her to death, kick in your chest
Losing your breath, feeling of death, feeling of death

[Outro: Cameronazi]
Stabbed her to death, kick in your chest
Losing your breath, feeling of death, feeling of death

[Outro: Zheani]
Stabbed her to death, kick in your chest
Losing your breath, feeling of death, feeling of death3Embed
