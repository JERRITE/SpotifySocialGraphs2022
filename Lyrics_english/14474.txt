Fashion Diller Lyrics ["Fashion Diller" letter]]

[Pre-stribe: taichu]
Money drops if I move it like this (Mwah)
Do not make you 'sweet when you talk about me (yes)
I drip her with my talent 'shit
Do not make you 'heavy, nail the grillz

[Chorus: taichu]
Dirty Pleasure, to think
They make 'false' account with my face in Tinder
Fashion dealer, I didn't end
I don't drink them, I chew them like a gum
Dirty Pleasure, to think
They make 'false' account with my face in Tinder
Fashion dealer, I didn't end
I don't drink them, I chew them like a gum
[Verse 1: Tiago Pzk]
Fashion like I'M at $ ap, her and 'my rihanna
The press looks me, call me fame
I make this' Bad Bitch become Beliebers (UUH)
I don't sell my style although I'm a fashion dealer
Oh my God, I Got That Hoes (Hoes)
I could buy me a rolls-royce with two shows (shows)
Always Blowing Up, Baby I want a Blowjob (OH)
Fuck, I always spend Nasty
The outfit is fit although I am not a max steel

[Verse 2: taichu]
I spend my bills on clothes and cheese
I don't have a plan, I'm not going to lie to you
I get like this, shit natural
Billie The Girl, already know Mili (-li)

[Bridge: Taichu]
Pa-pa-pay day, and Don't Give A Fuck if today is not My Birthday
I get scented but always smell of green
I live in a parade, I exhibit what is not sold
What they know, know that I am you

[Chorus: taichu]
Dirty Pleasure, to think
They make 'false' account with my face in Tinder
Fashion dealer, I didn't end
I don't drink them, I chew them like a gum
Dirty Pleasure, to think
They make 'false' account with my face in Tinder
Fashion dealer, I didn't end
I don't drink them, I chew them like a gum
