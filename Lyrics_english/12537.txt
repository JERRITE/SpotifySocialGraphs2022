Alpha Zulu Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a moment to decide to compromise
You let me know some other time, some other day
You're now closer to the start than to the limit
Take a bow, vow to the sky, if you want to wait, great

[Chorus]
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Pray to your God, cover your lies
God or guru, hey, hey, hey
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Run for your life, cover your eyes
Alpha Zulu, hey, hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Tell me why, don't tell me when, don't tell me how
I must have died at fifty-one in 1953
Just accountin' to the stars, the only reason I'm allowed
There's a purple cloud in the consommé, ouais

[Chorus]
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Pray to your God, cover your lies
God or guru, hey, hey, hey
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Run for your life, cover your eyes
Alpha Zulu

[Post-Chorus]
Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?
Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I get your close up to sublime the alibi
Your Mona Lisa immortalized, décapitée
I wouldn't change, I wouldn't try another second
'Til I rise, a hologram waiting for the tiebreak
You might also like[Chorus]
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Pray to your God, cover your lies
God or guru, hey, hey, hey
Woo ha, singin' hallelujah
Run for your life, cover your eyes
Alpha Zulu

[Post-Chorus]
Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?
Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time with me?
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
(Why choose your body over time?
Why choose your body over time?)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey2Embed
