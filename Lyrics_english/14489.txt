On fire lyrics [letter from "to fire"]

[Chorus]
Vámono ', on fire, where not (where not)
There is time, you and me, without clock (without clock)
Envious want what I have (what I have)
Because they know what I have and they don't

Vámono ', on fire, where not (where not)
There is time, you and me, without clock (without clock)
Envious want what I have (what I have)
Because they know what I have and they don't
[Verse 1]
I invite you to go through my heart
Enter slowly and put into action
You understand that of seduction
And from what I see perfectly
Look how beautiful this situation:
Both in my bed, then the armchair
Turn off the light, I don't want vision
I want you to feel my feeling
You who are with me and I poor
You deserve your part of my million
You deserve a piece in my mansion
I deserve a pinch of your heat
To my gray day you put color
And to my good day you do better
Do not spend money on your dior blouse
I like your underwear more

[Pre-stribe]
And Vámono ', on fire
You burn me, I burn you
You leave, I die
You are, I come back
Again please

[Chorus]
Vámono ', on fire, where not (where not)
There is time, you and me, without clock (without clock)
Envious want what I have (what I have)
Because they know that I have you and they don't (they know they don't)

[Verse 2]
Baby all this is for you
Everything that wins I spend with you
Choose vacation in Ecuador or Paris
When all this is hitting here
Nena I take you for you want if you want until dawn
Only God will witness all the things we are going to do
I have my objective clear, stay here, I don't want to lose you
We break that routine and flow only as it has to be

[Pre-stribe]
And Vámono ', on fire
You burn me, I burn you
You leave, I die
You are, I come back
Again please
