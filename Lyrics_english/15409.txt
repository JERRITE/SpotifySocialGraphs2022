Blacklight Shine Lyrics[Verse 1]
You would be gone if it weren't for what I know
Help me out of this godforsaken cure

[Chorus]
If that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore
If that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away
Into lantern jaws

[Verse 2]
Lastimado sentimiento en mi cinturita
Dame rabia, dame todo el dolor
Karma tarda en llegar pero llegará
Lo vas a pagar
[Chorus]
If that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore
If that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away
Into lantern jaws

[Verse 3]
Y lo gritos van
Baila si quieres más
En pedazos quebrado
Me entregaste una vida de engaños
Lo vas a pagar

[Chorus]
If that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shorе
If that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away
Into lantern jaws

[Verse 4]
Rеseeding the desert, the high control hex
He obsessively pets with his thumbs
Thinking no one's watching
But I got the copy that he can never erase
He's fit for a crypt
A place for the errors in judgment that he can afford
And I am that moment that you never saw comin'
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And every fingerprint you answered for (For, for)
I'll shine the blackest light to the culprit on all fours

[Chorus]
If that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore
If that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away
If that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore
If that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away
Into lantern jaws1Embed
