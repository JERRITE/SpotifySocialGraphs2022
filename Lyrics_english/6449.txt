Daydream / Wetdream / Nightmare LyricsIt's in the ions, ions, ions, ions
It's in the ions, ions, ions, ions

Well I could die a happy man if I could be with you
Behind these eyes I believe fantasies can come true
It's in the ions, ions, ions, ions
It's in the ions, ions, ions, ions

Find the time to be the man that you like to talk to
In dreams it seems that I can be anyone you want me to
It's in the ions, ions, ions, ions
It's in the ions, ions, ions, ions
Love me, hold me
Find me on the off-beat
Hold my hand, say I'm your man
Take me down, to the promised land
Oohh Ohhhh
Oohh Ohhhh

Sunlight, moonbeams
Your hands inside my dreams
Hold me close, never let go
Promised land, and away we go
Oohh Ohhhh
Oohh Ohhhh
Oohh Ohhhh
Oohh Ohhhh

Home is where the heart is
Down by the neighbor kids
Back where we used our given names
Sweet, sweet curiosity
Led me to this here street
Please don't make this go away
Don't wake up, wake up, wake up

Here, we can do as we please
Oh, we are living free
Oh, take it day by day
Sweet, sweet curiosity
Led me to this here street
Please don't make this go away
Don't wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wake up, wake up, wake upYou might also like4Embed
