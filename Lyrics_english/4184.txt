[Intro: Ñejo, Rauw Alejandro & Ñengo Flow]
Wo ', this is my lifestyle, My Fuckin' Lifestyle, Motherfucker
Ra-Rauw
Real G4 Life, Baby
Ñejo
My lifestyle, Yeh, my lifestyle, Yeh
I vo'a suck your ass in the sea suite—

[Verse 1: Archangel & Rauw Alejandro]
(Ey, me '; Wuh!)
I vo'a suck the toto (already '), in the private jet (aha)
The time 'have changed (wow)
And I'm still in good condition (ah; wuh)
I'm still giving current, I haven't retired (no)
I look at the sky and thank you for what I have been looking for (auh)
Straight to four tires, I am well mounted (rrrm!)
From the beginning 'I have been quoted all the time (Yeh)
I no longer compete with anyone, I'm positioning (-NA'O)
My repertoire speaks only even if I am silent (mmm)
And I moved to Miami (EY), tremendous choice (Choice)
The first rapper 'with a Rolls Royce
No matter what I shine, I have my vision clear (woh)
I didn't change my person when I saw myself on television (I '; Oh, Yah, Ra-Rauw)
[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
God has never failed to me, my prayers have listens
The girls ask for rauw, they love me in to 'la'o
If the Blunt is Enrola'o, why is the fuck off?
With the sensei mochal'o, making a burn-out (oh, no)
And the TRD in cash I bought it
The street, R.D., just in case the 'chambeé
Mine never changed, I didn't park 'in the valet
He is no longer skinny, I kept it, I went out all mommy (Yah!)
There is no more 'Window Shopper (Yeh)
What I want without fear I buy it (OH-OH)
The fridge is not lacking anything (ah)
And to the people in my neighborhood, if they need me, I answer (UH)

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Myke Towers]
ESBAMO 'Jodíos', now you can border
Things have changed, nothing is the same
Those who did not believe can breastfeed me
Héctor Lavoe told me that my luck was going to change (Yeh)
ESBAMO 'JODÍO', now you can border
The thing 'have changed, nothing e' equal
What they didn't believe can suck
Héctor Lavoe told me: "Everything has its end"

[Verse 3: Myke Towers]
Young Kingz
When they were zero they didn't want
They took envy because it seems that I get the lottery
That is not lucky, that was' blessing with aim
And how are you fucking 'they look like the fault and' mine
Not even Basket game, but I love Michael Jordan
I have so much 'teni' that they go fashionless without putting it
Flow with cojone 'pa' overshadow the opposite
There are money for lawyer for if not 'the tomba falls
And I prefer a grave where I was born than a cell outside (Yah)
The world e 'yours, I have a woman' rega 'for to'a the sphere
The one that pichea cela, they adorn me a garment 'that blind
If I make the 'mine' intercern and 'impossible to go back
The 'they did not believe are now peeling for mame
In the letter I feel in Barbosa, Angelo
The 'ass' that before' ignored, today they call me give it to me
Bast
Connects, respect and protected by those who play
With the 'stick' as if it were Guitar Hero
As I gave my life, they think that I am the chosen
Bastard, I don't know if e 'my style, but he sticks to' whatever
I don't sleep, I always take care
Before 'was broke and famous, but I had to do'
The street warrant is almost the same as hell
And when I die I want the world to hook the 'iron'
They shoot for my burial air, Young Kingz

Ah!
You feel bastard 'Tar on the top

I do not fail, my sister, what Zumbo and 'Buckets (Buckets, Buckets)
I became the Harden of this Houston Rockets (hahahaha)
My lifestyle changed, but I don't (I don't)
The shows are filled to 'until without promo
This' wants to border on me, Brother, and I wonder how (ey; ah)
I still grow without fertilizer (ey; ey-ey)
I bought a house, already the baby has the future fact (ah)
My name will be permanent in the game, so chest for that (Yeah)
I continue on the prowl (UH-UH), the sagaea is over (Hol 'Up)
That my luck was going to change, said Héctor Lavoe, and I believed him (You Know It)
Gracia 'gave' to bless me, to my mai 'for giving myself to me (Yeah)
To my country to tell me that I was going to be the last to laugh (OH)
That for my mind I will never happen to give me (understand '?)
Although this 'go' the ship wants to sink
I'M DONE, Miky Woodz

[Verse 5: Ñengo Flow]
I didn't have a punched, now I have to '
I bought Smithan 'before' and now what I buy e 'glock
The whore 'know who e' el boss, the toto wet
In my room he landed and undressed
The mom wants her to mount it in the banshee and the motor
He also wants me to teach him to shoot with my gun (ah)
The blessing 'of my life are well bastard'
Because I have to 'lo' mine 'firing foot' and the canvas
The King of Kings, the king is that, the owner 'e the crown
And thanks to him I take a flow that does not forgive
Filling stadium ', singing rap pa' keep the family
Inside 'e my mind only Glority, Real G until Eternity
The best
Look for me a whore, it's more ', that they are do' (vo'a breaking it to ')
Above '' e me, only dad God (wow)
People above 'e me, only do' (only do ')
My country that e 'a Berraco and my mai' that gave me up
[Verse 6: Kenai]
So, mommy, come that I take you to the clouds
They frustrate because I go up where they don't go up
And tell him what he wants already had it
And I bought you a perfume, you perfume you 'When you smoke
A-a-a-ae, blessed 'I' broke to Toíto '
Su-Su-suck that I take off, but I don't take off
Destroying it 'alone, and to your cat' pantie 'I take it
I don't wrap myself, but if I wrap myself, I miso
Sounding in everything 'the district'
To the 'baby' le 'I send kiss'
So, mommy, come that I take you to the clouds
They frustrate because I go up where they don't go up
And tell him what he wants already had it
And I bought you a perfume, you perfume you when you smoke

[Verse 7: Ñejo & Ñengo Flow]
(Ñejo)
I am going to breastfeed the bug in the Marriott suite
I'm already a millionaire, no gánster or hitman
I look for the background 'killing the stadium league'
I think you heard me sounding on the radio
Look for a whore, it's more ', what's do'
Above 'and my dad just'
People above 'e me only do'
My country that kept me, my mai 'that raised me
Tell me mommy, what does it like you?
I tell you four beautiful 'and it blushes
I have the Purple Flower, look for the sheet
He says he doesn't have Pantie ', he wants him to take her
And maybe na 'what I have I deserve it
But Dad wanted and pointed to Carlos Crespo
The kid ', I put them to the bank, or I put them
I spend it with a whore and put it
I keep a couple of weight ', the others spending them
La Mercedes Nueva, the rest in Pasto
So ugly, like that, I bastard him, are you deaf?
The jeva of yours wants to pour a dust
More money, more problem ', as Biggie said
Pa'l fuck to 'it', stop another phillie
My past is black, but with that Brego
And don't wait for me tonight because I think I don't arrive

[Interlude: Ñejo]
Pérate, Pérate, Pérate
Mere, leave the track bastard
I wrote a new Chanteo, 2020

[Verse 8: Ñejo]
I remember when I was well fucking '(good fucking')
That the only check that was in my name (mailman)
It was the 'coupone', what kind 'e cojone'
I had to 'put it once', then 'more' never 'put' (nah)
What a cool to be great, as Héctor said
But and more bastard be humble to be a fuck 'insect (you know')
I changed my lifestyle, I made a couple of weight '(Amen)
But according to progress also the 'stumbling block
When I get up, when I lie down I pray
A way to live to which the world has access (to 'the world)
But I don't even know when a hug and 'really (nah)
I don't even realize when I lied a kiss (muah)
That's why I care about 'fuck' what people speak (thirt 'fuck')
I later 'that the old woman arrives to' lo 'western (uh)
And the Hater 'can really suck an egg
And of course vo'a suck that ass again, ma '
