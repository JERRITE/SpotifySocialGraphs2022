Chasinâ€™ Honey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some parts of my brain are probably still sleeping
I wish I could tell, but I'm probably still sleeping
I look to the window, I look through your eyes
I can see my reflection, but I can't close the blinds

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like someone's determined to change how I think
But if I just close my eyes, I'll wake from each dream

[Chorus]
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' money
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' honey
[Verse 2]
If ever you want me, if ever you need me
I may not be conscious, but baby, I'm honest
I'll look to the mirror, I'll look through your heart
I can see good intentions, but we tear them apart

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like someone's determined to change how I think
But if I just close my eyes, I'll wake from each dream

[Chorus]
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' money
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' honeys

[Bridge]
And what's oxygen on the weekend?
Just caught a cold outside
But when I called you Monday
I needed you Sunday
I needed you on me
You might also like[Chorus]
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' money
Would it let you down if we don't grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody?
They're all just chasin' honey

[Outro]
But when I called you Monday
I needed you Sunday
I needed you on me4Embed
