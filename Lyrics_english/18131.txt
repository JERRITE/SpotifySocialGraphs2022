The Eulogy of You and Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You showed up in a black veil
A black dress
I left you black roses on your steps
I guess the last kiss was the kiss of death

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're dead to me, and it's R.I.P
Here lies all of the lies
And all of the pain that I buried inside (Oh, oh)
Goodbye, I know it's tragic
The memory of us will go up in ashes
[Chorus]
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me

[Verse 2]
You put your black lipstick on my neck
Dug your black nails into my chest
Now I got these scars that you left

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're dead to me, and it's R.I.P
Here lies all of the lies
And all of the pain that I buried inside (Oh, oh)
Goodbye, I know it's tragic
The memory of us will go up in ashes

[Chorus]
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
(You and me, you and me)

It's written in stone
We're better alone
Thought that we would be together forever
But now I know that we won't

[Chorus]
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me
Of you and me
This is the eulogy of you and me
Of you and me14Embed
