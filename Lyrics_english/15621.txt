Lyrics Star Rain [Come 1]
I feel that you have aroused the need not to let you escape
I feel eternity when you are, it's like a lunar trip
I know that you and I used to be floating in immensity
Traveling through time at high speed
I will find you

[Hook]
You are my rain of stars, your eyes make me fly
You take me to other planets, where you make me scream
My destiny is not mine, if you are not by my side
It is a divine game that you can touch me
[See 2]
We are like the horizon has no end
It's not a coincidence, you stole my present
And in solitude my storm modula
I know that you and I used to be, made of space dust
Warm temperature, light of darkness, there I will find you

[Hook]
You are my rain of stars, your eyes make me fly
You take me to other planets, where you make me scream
My destiny is not mine, if you are not by my side
It is a divine game that you can touch me

[Bridge]
You will live shining like nobody else will
No costume, I like you more
I want to give you more so you always want to return to me
Feeling that fear beats us

[Hook]
You are my rain of stars, your eyes make me fly
You take me to other planets, where you make me scream
My destiny is not mine, if you are not by my side
It is a divine game that you can touch meuou might Also likembed
