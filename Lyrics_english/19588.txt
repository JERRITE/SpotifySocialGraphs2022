Epiphany Lyrics[Verse 1: Futuristic]
I had an epiphany
I was repeating history
I was doing everything I hated
The weight on my shoulders
I let it all get to me (I let it all get to me)
I had an epiphany
I just smiled at my enemies
I was listenin' to everybody who was talkin'
But never did shit for me, yeah
I had an epiphany
I was lookin' at everybody else that's up in the industry
They ain't as sick as me (They ain't as sick as me)
I had an epiphany
I was seein' somebody that never had no good intentions for me
Now she missin' me, yuh (Now she missin' me)
Yeah, moral of the story is nobody did it for me
Had to make a change (Nah)
I was livin' in the city with no scene
I had a dream I had to make a lane (Yup, yup)
Always knew that I couldn't live off of minimum wage
Rippin' the pay stub (Woo)
I had a minimal taste for all the fame stuff (Woo)
But I got into the game without a cent to my name
And now I'm ballin' like I'm in the NBA, bruh
And I know I got a lot but I'm not content (Yeah)
If they ask me to stop, I will not consent (Yeah)
Never let nobody block 'cause my shot to miss (Yeah)
You can meet me at the top if you hop the fence
And you climb the stairs
And you fight the beast
And you lose your way
Then you find your peace
And you do it sober
Then you find a drink
Then you spiral down
And it all repeats
And I always had a vision I could get it
So I did it by my lonely
I don't owe nobody nothin', never let nobody own me
Got some money from the music, and I spend it on the homies
But don't put nothin' before me, gave a whip to little brodie
And I'm only gettin" started (Started)
And I'm eatin' with the people that I starve with (Starve with)
And my batteries, I had to recharge 'em (Recharge)
I made an album but that shit was garbage
Yo, I was trapped in a gimmick
I finally get it
I'm here to make music that matters
If I die, it'll all be alright
'Cause the message I gave you will live for me after
And my chapter will highlight a lifetime (Lifetime)
Of energy gave through a bright mind (Bright mind)
How you never had to stand on the sideline? (Sideline)
How you the guide to your own guidelines?
[Chorus: Futuristic]
That's an epiphany (That's an epiphany, that's an epiphany)
I had an epiphany, yeah (—piphany, yeah, —piphany, yeah)
That's an epiphany (That's an epiphany)
I had an epiphany, yeah (I had an epiphany, yeah)

[Verse 2: NF]
I had an epiphany
That I could make history
That I could prove everyone wrong
That told me I wasn't cut out for this music thing, yeah
I had an epiphany
What if I took my energy
And used it on positive things in my life
Instead of the people that lie to me, huh? (Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Yeah, I had an epiphany
That I could put all of my hurt into music
And use it for people that might feel the same as me (The same as me, same as me, same as me, same as me)
Yeah, I had an epiphany
What if everyone knew my depression was worse than they thought?
They probably gon' look at me differently (Differently, differently, differently, differently)
Yo, this song got me goin' back, when I was a stupid kid
Thinkin' maybe I could make it in the music biz
And then I figured out the politics
And realized that half of y'all don't even know what music is
Ain't goin' nowhere, I told 'em to get used to me
Feels like I'm livin' in a movie scene
A bunch of people tryin' to tell me how to act and breathe
One thing I never let nobody ever do was tell me who to be
I never got into the party scene
Maybe I was just scared to drink
'Cause addiction it runs in my family
That's someone I was scared to be
You're lookin' pitiful compared to me
Since I can barely read
All I wanted was somebody I could trust
That I knew would keep it real with me
Rap's always been a mirror for me
That's when I figured out that maybe I'm the one that's gotta make it on my own, yeah, it's clear to see
A lot of people thinkin' what I'm doing is a gimmick
Everything you hear me writin' I've been livin', I ain't quittin'
Send the money to my family, try to show 'em that I miss 'em
And I cherish every moment when I'm home and when I'm with 'em
And it's just the way that I feel (I feel, I feel, I fee)
In the industry of fakes tryna stay real (Stay real, stay real, stay real)
In the industry of lames tryna get deals
Lord knows I'ma get it, that's Meek Mill (Meek Mill, Meek Mill)
Yeah, I lay in my bed at night thinkin'
"There's gotta be more to me"
I'm tryin' to pay off the mortgaging
But the life of the people I love in the midst of it
I've always thought that if
I learn from mistakes that I make, even losses are victories
That's when it starts hittin' me
If you set your mind to it, you can do anything

That's an epiphany (—piphany, —piphany)
That's an epiphany, yeah (—piphany, yeah —piphany, yeah)
I had an epiphany (—piphany, —piphany, —piphany)
I had an epiphany, yeah (—piphany, yeah)35Embed
