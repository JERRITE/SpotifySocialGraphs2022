Shouldn’t Have to Run Lyrics[Gentle Bones]:
How are you doing?
How have you been?
Sending this text for the fifth time this week

So, when can I call you?
There's so much to say
Sending this text 'cause I struggle when we are face to face

If you only knew
The love you refuse
Waiting by the phone for you
But you misunderstand
When I make these plans
Try to please, then try to mend
[Gentle Bones & Joie Tan | Chorus]
'Cause I shouldn't even have to run
When did this lose all it's fun?
I know these words are never ones that you want
But you won't say that we're done
(If you told me what you want)
Then you wouldn't even have to run

[Joie Tan]
How are you feelin'?
Are you free in the evenin?
I just wanted to see you on the outside of my dreams

[Gentle Bones, Joie Tan, Gentle Bones & Joie Tan]
But I'm guessin' you'd rather try this tomorrow
Honestly, right now, we're all
Feeling that way now for too long
Let's get this over with
If we only knew
The love we refused
Try to please, then try to mend

[Gentle Bones & Joie Tan | Chorus]
'Cause I shouldn't even have to run
When did this lose all it's fun?
I know these words are never ones that you want
But you won't say that we're done
(If you told me what you want)
Then you wouldn't even have to run
You might also like[Joie Tan]
Before you said I'm the one
I'd go away if you said "right now we're done"
Do you hear what we've become?
We shouldn't even have to runEmbed
