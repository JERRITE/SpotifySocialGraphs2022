La Player (Bandolera) Lyrics [Lyrics for "La Player (Bandolera)"]

[Enter: Zion, Lennox]
The Z and L
If even the light goes out alone
Stop, give it, dance now
To let go of a drink is taken
There is no one who lasted it tonight

And if you decide to stay with me
Come so that you are the witness yourself
This is to see that I still don't forget it
Just one thing I ask you
What do you decide to stay with me
Come so that you are the witness yourself
This is to see that I still don't forget it
Just one thing I ask you

[Pre-car: Zion]
And tell me what they give you
Your ma'i, your pa'i in your home
What they did was a threat
Pa'lante there is no
Your ma'i, your pa'i in your home
What they did was a threat

[Chorus: Zion]
If even the light goes out alone
Stop, give it, dance now
To let go of a drink is taken
There is no one who lasted it tonight

And if you decide to stay with me
Come so that you are the witness yourself
This is to see that I still don't forget it
Just one thing I ask you

[Verse 1: Lennox]
And take and begin (y)
That I don't want me to get stressed
How rich it moves
Thus, repeat it, couple times (ahh)
Face to face, baby, it's already fire
Ponte, come, that in this I never lose
Seeing how with your body connected
Take, enjoy it, quiet

That if you want ', see you when you want (Yeh)

Something I tell him, but he told me that late he caught him in a return

And if you decide to stay with me (bop, bop)
Come so that you are the witness yourself
This is to see that I still don't forget it (Zu)
Just one thing I ask you

Your ma'i, your pa'i in your home
What they did was a threat
