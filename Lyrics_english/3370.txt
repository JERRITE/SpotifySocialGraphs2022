FFM Freestyle: Subsoils (Subsoils) Lyrics Scripton - "VBVVCTND"

So, what's here with us? What is here? (hey)

I am concealed at the microphone
What I want to know is that it is cool
In this water, like a shark
Words are dragging here, because I am like a mule body
The weather controlled everyday life
Feet froze in the city of Vetrov
Soverty of amounts, performed fate
Supported bitch, but you know
In fact, heaven is this judge
The authorities controlled everyday life
Feet froze in the city of Vetrov
The authorities controlled everyday life
As if wolves, sirens howl in the distance
Sing in anxious language
All brothers in business, all brothers are easy
Let the sirens howl in the distance
As if wolves, sirens howl in the distance
Sing in anxious language
All brothers in business, all brothers are easy
Let the sirens howl in the distance
Sound penetrates the ears
Kung fu from the columns of neighbors strangles
Rud-bo in a megalopolis in search of a meal
A nose bridge is breaking from a snow shower
The situation, reflections tells me from the puddle
It needs to be done, the belts are the same
And therefore do not believe, the rhyme breaks into the block
Sweeping from the loops of the door, throwing sweat on the forehead
As if wolves, sirens howl in the distance
Sing in anxious language
All brothers in business, all brothers are easy
Let the sirens howl in the distance
I am concealed at the microphone
All I want to know is that it is cool
In this water, like a shark
Words are dragging here, because I am like a mule body
OL 'Dirty Bastard - "Shimmy Shimmy Ya"

Um, I heard you

A taxi will not come today today
Willow has brains, the kettle slowly warms the water
I begin to sharply give out the words of my deck
Twelve time with sexual, catch from midnight
Hap is a hundred percent of a narrow syllable, cowboy
Are you ready to take pain, although
We are friends, here is a wild bit in the word driving
The Ministry of Health does not prohibit this
Although I don't care, I put on my kimono hop
And into battle
I am a young warrior, I realized who the king is here.
You should not climb
I am sure of rhyme-devices penetrate the heads of your cows and along the trodden alley
Someone saws, someone paints, someone turns gelik
Iva rushes around the bit as a sports
As if not to deceive yourself, as if not to deceive yourself, mm
Hey Hey
And what, what
IVE again at the helm, his syllable is a stream
Penetrate the microphone
At nights at night, breathing hide, my awaits
Syllable
What else to read out
So that as an open book, we are you
We penetrate her largest league
You need to know this
There is no need to strain here, this is dancing under the instrumental
Yu, do not be afraid here, I fly out like a bird
Yu, yes, baby, you don't dream of it
You, these are knitting needles, you, right into the brain
How do you like this smell of roses?
I see you smile
So you're lucky

For real? (ha ha)
The first emotions, like, remove his emotions, fucking

I have nothing, under my land I oil
I'm already walking after her and don't dare to interfere with me
They say, I will die, they say, I'm going to death
Well, I'm going to meet her just look at her
Tasting to taste, they say it is the most juice
I press the start, like you, like you (a)
Ready to influence the course, I was born to wash on a mustache
I am ready for this Move'S
I have nothing, I'm flying on a comet
Under the blows of a whip, I cut the wind through time
On people like me, networks are already being put outside the window
They say: "It is important to fuck them"
I have nothing, the word is my resource
They say, I will die, but I'm not led
They say, I will die - yes, this is sadness
They have no feelings, but there is no fear either - this is a plus
I have nothing, under my land I oil
I'm already walking after her and don't dare to interfere with me
They say, I will die, they say, I'm going to death
Well, I'm going to meet her just look at her
Tasting to taste, they say it is the most juice
I press the start, like you, like you (a)
Ready to influence the course, I was born to wash on a mustache
I am ready for this Move'S
(Ah) I have nothing, I'm already following her
(Hey) I have nothing, I'm already following her
(Uh) I have nothing (I have)
I have nothing, I have nothing
