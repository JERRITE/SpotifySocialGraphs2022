Lonely Train Lyrics[Verse 1]
Big train rollin' down the line, makes me lonely
Sometimes I wish to ride away
Sometimes I want to ride away, yeah
Big plane flyin' through the clouds, makes me worry
Sometimes I wish to fly away
Sometimes I want to fly away

[Chorus]
But you can't judge a book lookin' at the cover
You can't love someone messin' with another
No, you can't win a war fightin' with your brother
You wanna have peace, gotta love one another
[Verse 2]
Big guns lighting up the sky, makes me worry
Sometimes I wish to run away
Sometimes I want to run away

[Chorus]
But you can't judge a book lookin' at the cover
You can't love someone messin' with another
No, you can't win a war fightin' with your brother
You wanna have peace, gotta love one another

[Bridge]
I have seen my brothers in ashes on the ground
And maybe in a new life we can turn this thing around

[Chorus]
But you can't judge a book lookin' at the cover
You can't love someone messin' with another
No, you can't win a war fightin' with your brother
You wanna have peace, gotta love one another

[Outro]
No, you can't judge a book
Gotta love one another
Can't judge a book
No, you can't judge a bookYou might also like3Embed
