Prove Your Love Lyrics[Intro]
Aah, aah[x4]

[Verse 1]
I want to be inside your heart
That's the place, the place for me
But I could understand, it won't be easy

[Chorus]
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me
[Verse 2]
Like I say it isn't easy to let your heart run wild
So if you want to please me, baby then don't act like a child
But I can understand, it won' t be easy

[Chorus]
And you've got to prove, prove your love to me
You've got to prove, prove your love to me

[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter if you're far away
Or right here by my side
That's the way I feel about it
We can't let the whole thing slide

[Bridge]
Aah, aah[x4]

[Verse 4]
So if you can't see me right where you are
They why don't you send for me, baby by the nearest star
It won't be easy, and you've got to prove

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Aah, aah[x4]You might also likeEmbed
