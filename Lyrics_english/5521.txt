Newyorican 2020 Lyrics[Intro]
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
En mi viejo San Juan
Cuantos sueños forjé
En mis noches de infancia
But I'm taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

You could've been listening to anything in the world right now
But you're here with me
And I'm ever so grateful that you are
And I don't wanna disappoint you
So let's kick the year off right
Yeah
Let's go...
[Verse 1]
E - D - W - I - N
That's what you gonna get one hundred percent
I'mma serve it up to you completely genuine
No ghost writers, pеn names, no pseudonyms
I'm coming out of retirеment
I'm tired of y'all not being inspired
You need to choir boy to keep lighting your fires up
If you wanna know the truth
Ever since my youth, yo
The burden is heavy
But I lift it up like Zeus
'Cause my mindset is ready
And if you liking what you hear, yo
I'm breaking the levies
The floodgates of your ears
And the flow is just steady
It's time to reset your year
Newyorican 2020

[Hook]
Little boy born in North Jersey (Yo)
Lived every borough, except for Queens (Ha)
Phoenixville is his family
But is heart always in NYC
Little boy born in New Jersey (Yo)
Lived every borough, except for Queens
Puertoriqueño like the coquí
But is heart always in NYC (yo... yo...)

Two - Zero - One - Nine
That was a year that was better than fine
That was a year that I wish I could keep frozen in time
That was a year to bottle up and sell it online
You gotta understand that before 2019
I was infinitely sad, thought it was self esteem
It was never really bad with this pad and this dream
Gave up everything I had thought I was deceased
Once I understood what was happening to me
I could finally take control become a human being
It's like I woke up, knew exactly my mission
I threw away my bootstrap, picked up my ambition
Started out the year bustin' a gut
Hernia surgery couldn't keep Edwin stuck
Became Roman Captain Miles Gloriosus
Brides and Funerals became my magnum opus
Decided to train for a 5k
So I ran every day
Definitely not child's play
Dug down deep to run under the sun
Back of my mind was like "Run, Forrest, Run!"
'Dear Editor, I submit a correction
There were two races, one was his re-election'
Pressure's mountin' up, no one save me
I gotta run in the cold, I gotta keep kissin' babies
Leaving blood on the trail, Would they vote for me? Maybe
Could I ever prevail with the odds stacked against me
And I thought I would fail, mess up, come up empty
But the winner is Newyorican 2020
[Hook]
Little boy born in North Jersey (Amboy What Up)
Lived every borough, except for Queens
Phoenixville is his family (Phoenixville you know I love you)
But is heart always in NYC
Little boy born in New Jersey
Lived every borough, except for Queens
Puertoriqueño like the coquí (Where the boricuas at?)
But is heart always in NYC

[Verse 3]
One and-a two and-a three and-to-the four
I made third verse in case you're clamoring for more
Actually this verse is gonna be a user guide
Secrets that I learned to benefit humankind
So hear we go, take your pencils out for your first lesson
And let me show you how to live a life of progression
Aggression, Let it go
Expression, Let it flow
Rejection, Up and go
Deception, Let 'em know
You gotta learn to be open to hugs to open you up
When the universe calls out and sends out its love
But in order to receive it gotta undo the spells
You gotta come clean, gotta stop hatin' yourself
When the dark thoughts come to take over
And no more prayers for Allah, Jesus Christ, or Jehovah
Lookin' at your brother with the vision of envy
Lookin' at his bowl wondering why yours is empty
Wondering if the struggle will ever leave you gently
Just remember one story, Newyorican 2020

[Hook]
Little boy born in North Jersey (Yo)
Lived every borough, except for Queens
Phoenixville is his family (Raise Up)
But is heart always in NYC (Pick yourself up from wherever you are)
Little boy born in New Jersey
Lived every borough, except for Queens
Puertoriqueño like the coquí
But is heart always in NYC (Come on get up and bop with me)

[Outro]
I know you strugglin
But you're gonna make it through just like I did
Grand St... Represent
Soundview.. Represent
Stranded Island... Represent
Spanish Harlem... Represent
North Side... Represent

This is for all the people that helped me come all this way
I love you
Oh... and for ShaolinEmbed
