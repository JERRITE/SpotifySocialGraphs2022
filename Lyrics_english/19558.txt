Faster Lyrics[Intro: Dax]
LexNour
Stand up, we must fight
It's Dax, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Dax]
Couple niggas left me out to dry, I had to crucify
Stab me in my back, you ain't my dawg, you getting euthanized
Lying on the gang and speaking down, that shit is suicide
Black ain't no excuse, ain't getting off because we unified
[Chorus: Dax]
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster

[Verse 1: Dax]
You niggas straight sick, that's pitiful
Kill beats, that is my ritual
My words do flips reciprocal
Can't compete, I mean that literal
My flow is unpredictable
Moonwalk on beats, smooth criminal
Can't be copied, so original
Cannot stop me, I'm invincible
Fucking economy
Niggas throwing money like it's fucking Monopoly
Niggas hating on me, I'm a fucking anomaly
Gonna have to give your boy a fucking apology
You throw shade but follow me, follow me, that's a funny philosophy
People giving me clout the way I be using psychology
I was down at the bottom, but now they can't get on top of me
I be killin' the system and been abusing technology
Like, "Who that?" (Dax)
That nigga go too fast (Facts)
That nigga got two bags (Cash)
His bitch got D-cups (Racks)
That boy got supercalifragilistic', extra dirty, so ballistic
Bars that make you shit yourself while pissin' asking for forgiveness

Faster than you, faster, yeah, we move faster
Faster, faster
Faster than you, faster, yeah, we move faster than you
Faster, faster (Uh)

[Chorus: Dax]
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm the one, the N9ne's a wonder
I'm the thunder, wanna father me and I'ma son ya
Find the lungs to rhyme, it is crime upon ya
I the gun, I got her sayin', "Ay, caramba"
Elite when I get deep in a script
On a beat, I'ma get geeked in the mix
Want a piece? If he get beef in the lips
I'ma get the heat and he'll be leakin' a bit
I hail from the middle of the west, that's home
Nail every hit I get, I guess that's blown
The hell with a little bit of sales, I'm a killa with a—
Yell when I hit 'em with a Tech, I'm gone
People thinkin' my age'll mean that I'ma stop with this
Like my legacy lie in necropolis
All of you take a dick in your esophagus
To the people I'm a freak show
But I really will damage your ego
When the beat go, nigga, finito
Finna meet your G-O-D, though
Gasser the master
You met up with a slasher, the massacre
Is comin' with a pastor to pass your
Body to the after, but faster (Pyoom), grr
You heard me say don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
In the midst of the fight, everybody want gun, so I go
And it been that way
And within that spray, a disaster
When I rip and I flip on a bastard
I'ma plaster when I go faster
[Chorus: Dax]
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster
Came through faster
You move fast? Yeah, we move faster
Can't stop 'til we beat you bastards
Fuck with me and meet your master
Won't come last, we move right past ya
Destroy then I eat you rappers
You move fast? No, we move fast
If you go fast, we must go fast and even faster8Embed
