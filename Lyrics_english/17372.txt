Meerkat Lyrics[Intro]
(AyeTM)

[Chorus: Booka600]
In this big world, you my only girl (Girl)
I got only faith, I don't trust your moral
In this lonely race, I'm prepared to hurdle (Lonely race)
I be facin' the obstacles, you chasin' the girls
I don't wanna be opps with you, the love is pure
'Cause I remember them tellin' me, "Steve shot, it's severe"
I'm gon' love you forever, you in my heart, you secure
And I'm doin' two hunnid up in the 'Cat like a meer'
[Verse 1: Booka600]
We gon' take this abundance and we make it a marriage
Wе gon' take this three hunnit and we gon' make it a million
Lil' monеy embarrassin', but to them it's something bigger
Yeah, I got the cash, but that don't mean that I'm livin'
Yeah, just 'cause I'm ballin' don't mean I don't miss her
Yeah, just when it's over, I'm still socially distanced, yeah
We on the road, remindin' me of the kitchen (Yeah, yeah)
Save my riches, yeah, like a petition, yeah
It's not a way, it's a religion (Yeah)
Praying to God, hopin' he get it (Prayin' to God)
Keepin' my faith, hopin' to sense it (My faith)
Just wanna say, that I am fearless (Yeah)

[Chorus: Booka600]
In this big world, you my only girl (Girl)
I got only faith, I don't trust your moral
In this lonely race, I'm prepared to hurdle (Lonely race)
I be facin' the obstacles, you chasin' the girls
I don't wanna be opps with you, the love is pure
'Cause I remember them tellin' me, "Steve shot, it's severe"
I'm gon' love you forever, you in my heart, you secure
And I'm doin' two hunnid up in the 'Cat like a meer'

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Mixed emotions, I be up and down like a seesaw
Lot of niggas fuckin' up the game, I call them defaults
Hundred twenty bands, the Trans-Am came with tea towels
Neighborhood legend, I sold weed outta three spots
Ain't no understandin' in it
All my life, I planned to get it
I spend all my free time with my kids, I can't be playin' with niggas
Too deep in this shit to take a risk, I send my man to get 'em
Every bitch I ever wanted to get, I had a chance to hit 'em
Rollin' 'til my heart stop, Baby right in a wheelchair
I know that the, block hot, I don't know why I'm still here
And that old money wasn't shit, I set some real goals
They had us tired, we went up one, we kicked the field goal

'Cause I remember them tellin' me, "Steve shot, it's severe"
