Greatest Lyrics[Chorus: Reazon]
Hold my cup
As I put a song up, sold
Obviously, all my shit is lookin’ cold
Here to tell you the story that ain’t told
Of how I'm not there yet but ill be the greatest in the world

[Verse 1: Reazon]
Ain’t got no dark past
Matter of fact
Shit go back
But I ain’t talkin’ livin’ in a ghetto
No high key lies, you know this here ain't falsetto
Took more than a momento
To get where I am, fellow
Let’s keep it on the mellow
I was never a predator
But I got into rap at age 10
Won’t bend the truth, shit never end
Listenin’ to basic shit
Some Disney Channel 'Lemonade Mouth' shit
That O.G 'Determinate' type shit
Had to keep that stuff clean, shit
Little kid with many dreams, shit
Didn’t even know that Cole was on the scene, shit
Man, I ain’t seen shit
Livin’ where the grass is green, shit
Alright, alright, see, sit
Let me tell you about me, this
Ain’t some beef, but let’s meet, this dude
Ain’t what you thought he was
Or maybe you did
I don’t give a fuck
All I know is it ain’t about luck
Cause then I saw MMLP2
Rap god’s what got me stuck
To the game
Was still rappin' with no name
Surfin’ videos seein’ claims
All these rappers say they the best in the game
They insane
But Em’s sane
Hmm, what to say
With role models, made Andale
No role models, how Cole was made
Forest hills, always engraved
In my mind, inspiration gained
Got me on fire like propane
[Chorus: Reazon]
Hold my cup
As I put a song up, sold
Obviously, all my shit is lookin’ cold
Here to tell you the story that ain’t told
Of how I'm not there yet but ill be the greatest in the world

[Verse 2: GiovanZay & Reazon]
I aim to be like the greatest yeah
Been feelin' so underrated yeah
Can't wait for the day I make it yeah
Been told I'm crazy, I claimed it yeah
Diversity is what I'm aimin' for
Waiting, I'm patient to fuckin score
Rappin like my life dependin' on it
Look
I ain't got no reason to reason with anyone that's not Reazon
I rap like the seasons, chill, hype, chill, hype
Been ill for life, make all beat types
My rhymes on fire, whatchu expect when I wasted my time, most my time, just to spit a rhyme, just to get a dime, fuck am I looking like if I give up my career
Fuck that shit I ain't livin' in fear
Sick of life, but I'm too ill to disappear
I'm right here, through the sweat and the tears
Through the hate of peers, after all these years
And it appears as tho I'm rising 'bove tiers
Watch me be the greatest you ever hear, I WILL persevere
I been pushed and pulled and felt like shit
I tossed and turned and lived through abyss
Felt lost, learned to flush foes like piss
Till I stop givin' shits, never trusted no bitch
So I started writing rhymes just to be stable
Now I'm almost a one-man record label
I'll hold Guinness records for my genius records
I will wreak havoc and cause Armageddon
Fallen angel, I fell from the grace of heaven
Disgrace that I felt, lived and sinned like a devil
Embrace myself to elevate above levels
They tried to push down my creations
But I used that shit as an elevator
I will make it, GiovanZay been crazed since his old days
Since he was a young kid filled with rage, now released from his cage
You might also like[Chorus: Reazon & GiovanZay]
Hold my cup
As I put a song up, sold
Obviously, all my shit is lookin’ cold
Here to tell you the story that ain’t told
Of how I'm not there yet but ill be the greatest in the world

[Outro: GiovanZay]
Greatest in the world, yeah
I'll be the greatest in the world, yeah
