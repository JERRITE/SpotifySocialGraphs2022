Never the 1 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Met you in October
You talked sweet and a little slow
And I thought mm
I think I mm
Warm eyes and your hands cold
You sang soft like a sore throat
And I thought mm
I think I mm

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know you're dangerous
I saw through your games and played them
And I hate myself for letting you win
[Chorus]
Now I could write ten songs
'Bout nine ways you fucked me over
Only took you eight days
To forget seven months together
We were up 'til six in the morning
Five days a week
You said forever
Then left before I counted to three
Loved you a littlе too much
But I was never, I was nevеr the one

[Verse 2]
You met me on a Friday
I dressed up like a first date
So you'd think, mm
I think I mm
And I knew we loved when
You stayed past 2 AM
And I thought mm
"Does he think mm?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I knew you were dangerous
I saw through your games and played them
And I hate myself for letting you win
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I could write ten songs
'Bout nine ways you fucked me over
Only took you eight days
To forget seven months together
We were up 'til six in the morning
Five days a week
You said forever
Then left before I counted to three
Loved you a little too much
But I was never, I was never the one

[Bridge]
Met you in October
Talked sweet and a little slow
And I thought you're it
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling)￼

[Chorus]
Now I could write ten songs
'Bout nine ways you fucked me over
Only took you eight days
To forget seven months together
We were up 'til six in the morning
Five days a week
You said forever
Then left before I counted to three
Loved you a little too much
But I was never, I was never the one
I loved you a little too much
But I was never, I was never the one7Embed
