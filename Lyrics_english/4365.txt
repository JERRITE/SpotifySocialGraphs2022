Promise Lyrics ["promise" ft letter. Sou el florador, Mulero el Martiano & Kronix Magical]

[Enter: Sou el floradora]
(Mozart Muzik)
If you don't have me you don't value me
Thinking about you spend the hours
If I am not your owner, who will love you now? (Magical City)

[Choir: Carlitos Rossy, I excrement]
I promise not to leave you alone (OH-OH)
If you want to trust me
I vo 'to eat, torate to'a (to'a)
I'm not the same, baby, I'm pa 'ti (Yeh-Yeh-Yeh)
I promise not to leave you alone
If you want to trust me (huh)
I vo 'to eat, torate to'a
I'm not the same, now I'm pa 'ti-i
[Verse 1: gigolo]
Bubu
I never want to leave you alone
Let me paint your crayola blue sky
Your heart cries, tears of blood and I am the one who consoles you
tell me you Love Me
Tell me what needs me 'in your bed
Tell me that I am the only one you call
Tell me what you feel mom
I want to see when it touches you ', and I see you
I want to see you using the de'o
Ask what you want and I cost it
Oh, I am company, why don't you trust '?
Baby, I want you to be mine, and give you to 'the day'
Baby (yes)
I know you are alone and want to give you (yes, yes)
Gigolo

[Verse 2: Mulero el Martiano]
(Mulero)
You and I so 'do' in one
You are half of my heart, with you I want my future
I promise not to leave you, I swear
You are the curse that does not break any spell
Not even a second without thinking about you
You are the reason what I drink and smile every day '
Your crying heart dies for me
And VÃ¡mono 'pa'l mall when you feel' sad and empty- (-a)
Pa 'ti there is no time and time
Violame no losing delay
Seductive, now 'now

[Verse 3: Exce]
Who will be if I am not?
He took out your tears and also who dried them
When your heart had a lock, the one who opened and stole it
The child they say on the street
That, my love, who loves you like nobody (the E ')
And today I fear losing and living without you after death
Money does not make me happy, I am happy just looking at you
I can get the clock, but time I can't buy you
You have been selfish and I have knew how to value you
If I miss you, even in solitude I will accompany you

[Verse 4: Carlitos Rossy]
The others stayed in the game
I'm not the same since you gave me the play
You joined me, my heart deciphed it
But now I miss you ', and I don't know how to look for you
Says' you don't trust (no)
But I already left all the faults' (Yeh-Yeh)
What I want is that you are just mine (mine)
He said we are the same, but I am not with you my soul feels empty
So Ve-E-in, leave the fucking
I know that what we have there is no one who understands it
Knows'
[Verse 5: Sou el floradora]
I'm pa 'ti (I'm pa' ti), that's obvious
As [?], Together we are asylum love (asylum)
Forever I will be (eh) who mistreats you in bed, baby, Yeh
