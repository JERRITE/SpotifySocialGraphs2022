To love you Lyrics [lyrics by "pa love you"]

[Intro]
Who told you that in the future we can be friends?
And do how I didn't live with you, Yeah
I tell you, for you, don't count on me
Mommy, who whores told you?
I will be fine if I see you around with another
Doing things that were only from us, Yeah
It's all or nothing with you, don't count on me
[Chorus]
Sorry but, baby
They sent me to this world to love you
Do not see how with another you have fun, Yeah
The thing about us is to death, if not, luck
Sorry but, baby
They sent me to this world to love you
Do not see how with another you have fun, Yeah-eh
The thing about us is to death, if not, luck, yeah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse]
You go there by giving you kisses with To's (with To's)
I kept my mouth only pa 'ti
And besides being Mandona, it bothers you that I go out of partying
And do the same as you out there
Baby, no, I'm not interested in what you want from me
You just look for the days of rest and sleep
Today I drank a couple of glasses with friends and I'm realizing
That if you are not I am happier
(Give him, give him)

[Saying]
Will return ', a-and
Asking to kiss you again
Asking me to get pa 'ti
I do songs like this
And you with another party, baby
Will return ', a-a
Asking to kiss you again
Asking me to get pa 'ti
If not, then turn around
Mommy, there is' the door
