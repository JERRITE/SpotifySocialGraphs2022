Island Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can anybody here pass me a beer
And I might keep playing this music that you hear
And if you know the song
Then come and sing along with me

Walking with the beach to my left
Sea to my right
And I might get faded at the Tiki bar tonight
Then I might roll one up
Like my name is Bob
Yeah, I am going to party like I am a Jamaican
[Chorus]
If you really want to know where you can find me
I will be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
You should loose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands

[Verse 2]
Can anybody here pass me the rum
And we can find somebody who can play the steel drums
And if you like this beat then everybody dance with me
We got the ladies to the left
Fellas, to the right
And everybody's faded at the Tiki bar tonight
And we are going to dance to the rhythm of the waves
While we drink Bacardi by the bonfire flames

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You do not need no invitation, no
Whoa!
If you are looking for relaxation
Get away, get away with me
Make your destination my location
