We are opposite poles or do not match (Yeah)
Sometimes we fight and do not have fun
He tells me that he loves me, but in an oversight he can
That you want me send 'pal' fucking meaningless (ah-ah-ah)
You tell me to leave you and if I leave you, I pissed you '
As much as I tell you whenever I don't vo'a to leave you alone (Yeah)
I don't understand your logic (Mommy)
I don't know what they taught you at Catholic School
[Pre-car: Lasso]
If you talk to me in English, I understand you
If you talk to me in French, I understand you
If he speaks to me 'in Spanish, I understand you
But if you talk about love (ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse 2: Big Soto]
Baby, from you nobody separates me
If it's not with you, I don't want anything
You are my cafesito in the morning
When the sun goes out the window
Baby I do not understand you
I don't know if you have to be like that
Or maybe your way of affection is different
I have 'good and bad at the time, Yeah
