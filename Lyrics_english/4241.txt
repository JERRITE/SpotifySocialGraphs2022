Your friend Lyrics [your friend "letter"]

[Enter: Mora]
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
Hey Hey

[Pre-car: Mora]
Playing with my mind is your nature
It makes you very easy
I tried to get you out of my head
But almost, almost
The day 'pass, the time' fly
I get crazy if you hit you '
I will make you to 'although it should not
And calm, who between us stays
[Chorus: Zion & Mora]
And I know that you say 'I'm just your friend
The one that when there is no lu 'makes you to', the bed witnessed
And I know that you say 'I'm just your friend
The one that when there is no lu 'makes you to', the bed witnessed

[Verse 1: zion]
Your encounter is not a casual, for me it is a bit illogical
In my life a historical act
You have taken me to travel, you are my platonic love
You traveled here for a modest price
Your lips definitely have something magnetic
I must take something energy
I don't want this magical moment to fall
That's why I get romantic
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada

[Verse 2: Mora]
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
I giving you and your sweaty
Having po'l hair
And you biting the pillow
Four point 'in the note
But the leak arrives and the baby is uproar
A buga bastard picket
She owes me something and vo'a charge her fee
No one is going to talk because nobody does not see
Before 'it was modeled, now it goes on TV
In bed and 'flexible, practices ballet
So much that wet to 'and I slipped
And e 'what, ma', with that ass I swear that I marry
That voltage that you have 'there' t√° scar
I just ask for a piece, tell me to arrive and step
I pick you up and suit them 'just in case
