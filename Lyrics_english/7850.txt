PEP IN MY STEP Lyrics[Intro]
(Got a 30 on my seat, uh)
Oh really?
Big Doe Beezy, nigga, you know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
Rubberband Money Gang (Oh really?)

[Verse 1]
Opps always dissin' me, but nan' one never shot at me (Fool)
I done dropped my lo' so many times, they still ain't got at me (Fools)
I just walked in Saks, I got the sack, I told 'em Prada me
Ask Future, bitch, Doe B, he known for armed robberies (Freeband Gang)
Most these niggas claimin' slatt business, they ain't slime to me (Slatty)
Tryna fuck, but she ain't toppin' me, I feel she tryin' me (Goodbye, baby)
I don't leave without the fire on mе, I'm where the drama bе
Where the drama be, got that glizzy, bitch, I'm tryna see
What you tryna see? Starin' at my ice gon' leave you blind, dog
Lost your mind, you thought that was your wife, for real, she mine, dog
[Chorus]
Opps say I don't be steppin', shit, my step got some pep in it (Steppin', big steppin')
Opps say I don't be steppin', shit, my step got some pep in it (Oh really?)
Broski said the opps on the block, let's spin it (Spin that bitch)
Broski said the opps on the block, let's spin it (Spin that bitch)
Opps say I don't be steppin', shit, my step got some pep in it
Let's spin it

[Verse 2]
They say I'm like Eazy E and I'm like, "Hmm, is that right?" (Oh really?)
Only way that he like me, shit, my gun the same height (Graow, baow)
I'm still good up in my hood 'cause they respect my old life (Knowles Ave)
When I get dressed, I'm fly like private, you get dressed, you coach flight (Fool)
This a Moncler bubble coat, right? Bitch said my coat nice (My coat)
Bought twenty chains, they still ain't snatched shit, still got my old ice (Well, damn)
Ain't shit changed, I'm still gon' jump in, see why my bros fight
(Oh really?)
Grew up hopeless watchin' Barney, now I'm walkin' 'round in Marni (Marni)
You see me, we fifty deep, Doe Beezy walk 'round with an army (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
I put ice all on my Cartis, niggas mad because I'm ballin' (Cartier)
Pooh Shiesty mask, I shot up the party, ain't nobody saw me
Blrrrd, blrrrd, bodies fallin', now the oppers tryna call me
I just dropped a hundred K on my new kit, I got 'em salty (Fool)

[Chorus]
Dame ridin' in a Range with that dog on him, he got his pits in it
Opps say I don't be steppin', shit, my step got some pep in it (Steppin', big steppin')
Opps say I don't be steppin', shit, my step got some pep in it (Oh really?)
(Spin that bitch)
