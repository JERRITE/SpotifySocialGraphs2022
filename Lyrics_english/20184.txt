TranslationsPortuguÃªsNicotine Lyrics[Intro]
(I look like Rocky Balboa)

[Verse 1]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Burn my lungs and curse my eyes
I've lost control and I don't want it back
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

[Pre-Chorus]
I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
[Chorus]
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Verse 2]
It's better to burn than to fade away
It's better to leave than to be replaced
I'm losing to you, baby, I'm no match
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

[Pre-Chorus]
I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Bridge]
Just one more hit and then we're through
'Cause you could never love me back
Cut every tie I have to you
'Cause your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad
Your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
