Elimination Lyrics[Intro]
(Run it back, Kairo)

[Chorus]
Fuck all that talkin', we gon' get 'em straight
I'm in the trenches damn near every day
I get the money and stay out the way
I'm movin' solo, can't fuck with no snakes
Pull out them bands and I got 'em amazed
She'll fuck me for a new pair of J's
He try to flex, chopper eatin' his face
Take off your vest 'cause you're losin' your fade
Bitch, where I'm from, my young niggas don't play
If they ain't convicted, they clutchin' them K's
Fuck all these hoes, tell 'em stay out my face
I can't fuck with you, too busy gettin' paid
All of my niggas keep it on the waist
Don't step in my section, that shit, it ain't safe
I'm on my shit, that's the reason they hate
Straight to the top, yeah, I'm on the way
[Verse]
Just left the bank, took out twenty thousand to flex
I'm feelin' like fuck a nigga
If you get out of line you get hit with that iron
It really ain't shit to come touch a nigga
I be all out of state, I just stay out of the way
Don't give two fucks about another nigga
Disloyal as fuck, ain't no choice but give up
So I had to stop trustin' niggas
Never did fuck with them other niggas
Really, I never did fuck with niggas
I just be around a couple niggas
Elimination, come and fuck a nigga
I just poured up me a deuce
Yeah, I fell in love with the juice
Backwoods, twistin' fruit
Assault rifle when I move
Uh, uh, I'm finna cop me a coupe
Twenty-three be on all of my shoes
I just cashed out on some jewels
It look like I stepped in the pool
Yeah, they be watchin' my moves
Can't take an L, I don't lose
He move wrong, make the news (Yeah)
You gon' get hit with that tool
Don't give a fuck about you
Step on the scene, bitches choose
My pockets full of them blues
They try to play me like a fool
'Cause I never did finish school
Now they tryna see what I do
You might also like[Chorus]
Fuck all that talkin', we gon' get 'em straight
I'm in the trenches damn near every day
I get the money and stay out the way
I'm movin' solo, can't fuck with no snakes
Pull out them bands and I got 'em amazed
She'll fuck me for a new pair of J's
He try to flex, chopper eatin' his face
Take off your vest 'cause you're losin' your fade
Bitch, where I'm from, my young niggas don't play
If they ain't convicted, they clutchin' them K's
Fuck all these hoes, tell 'em stay out my face
I can't fuck with you, too busy gettin' paid
All of my niggas keep it on the waist
Don't step in my section, that shit, it ain't safe
I'm on my shit, that's the reason they hate
Straight to the top, yeah, I'm on the way5Embed
