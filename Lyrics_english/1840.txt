Touchy Feely Lyrics[Chorus]
Hands on you, hands on me
I'm on you, she's on me (Yeah)
You met her then put me (Ooh)
Down for three (Ooh)
So touchy feely

[Verse 1]
I'm home and I'm restless
Gettin' boreder than a bitch
'Bout to roll me a spliff
Then my phone get a hit (Brr)
It's you and your best friend
In the zone, on a mission
Tryna smoke, tryna kick it
Won't tell me your secret
[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up some papers and golden wrappers
That's what you said
I got the bud for the mornin' after
That's what you said
And we in your bed
Smokin', passin', jokin', laughin'
You rubbin' my head, I'm touchin' your leg
Now we all get
So touchy feely

[Chorus]
Hands on you, hands on me
I'm on you, she's on me (Yeah)
You met her then put me (Ooh)
Down for three (Ooh)
So touchy feely

[Verse 2]
Kisses on my neck
Everything on deck (Yeah)
Everything on extra
Everything on wet
Perfect set
Perfect match
Mouth on this, facin' that, no regret (Oh-oh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up some papers and golden wrappers
That's what you said
I got the bud for the mornin' after
That's what you said
And we in your bed
Smokin', passin', jokin', laughin'
You rubbin' my head, I'm touchin' your leg
Now we all get
So touchy feely

[Chorus]
Hands on you, hands on me
I'm on you, she's on me (Yeah)
You met her then put me (Ooh)
Down for three (Ooh)
So touchy feely
Hands on you, hands on me
I'm on you, she's on me (Yeah)
You met her then put me (Ooh)
Down for three (Ooh)
So touchy feely

[Outro]
