Girls Are Always Right Lyrics[Refrain: Simone]
Ooh yeah, oh
Even if we're wrong, girls are always right
Even if we lie, girls are always

[Verse 1: Emmalyn]
What you gonna say?
What you gonna say, say when I tell you that I know you lied?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do, do when I'm packing my things tonight
[Pre-Chorus: Simone]
Without you, I'm better off
'Cause your kiss is just bad luck
I should've known from the start
You were best at breaking hearts

[Chorus: All]
Boy, why you trying to fight?
Get this straight tonight
Girls are always, girls are always right yeah
Boy, one day you will cry
And wish for you and I
Girls are always, girls are always right, yeah

[Refrain: All]
Even if we're wrong, girls are always right
Even if we lie, girls are always right

[Verse 2: Natasha]
I'm not gonna wait
I'm not gonna wait, wait if you're gonna mess it up again
I'm not gonna give
I'm not gonna give in, sorry we're not staying friends, no

[Pre-Chorus: Emmalyn & Lauren]
Without you, I'm better off
'Cause your kiss is just bad luck
I should've known from the start
You were best at breaking hearts

You're the only reason I stay up all night
And I'm wondering why you go on and on and on and on, yeah
Why you trying to please me after what you did?
Boy I so knew it that you'd go on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
