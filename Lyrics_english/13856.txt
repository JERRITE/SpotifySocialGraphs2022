Your Dystopic Creation Doesn’t Fear You Lyrics[Rap: Awkwafina]
Rats!
Rascals!
Yeah, rats!
Rascals!
Ayy, rats!
Rascals!
Say, rats!
Rascals! Yeah!
Hey, El Paso
Better keep 'em on a lasso
In a rent control castle
Summer heat while the street teems assholes
Ayy, and I been getting like a hot mess
Hella rare like Loch Ness
Just pennies in the pockets
Not green but I’m smokin' like a botanist
Ayy, say rats!
[Chorus: Satomi Matsuzaki]
I’ve been in your cage 400 days
So why would I listen when you say
“Worry, worry baby?“

I’ve been in your cage 400 days
So why would I listen when you say
“Worry, worry baby?“

[Bridge]
Low low low low low...
Low low low low low...

[Chorus: Satomi Matsuzaki]
I taught you to dance 400 ways
So why would I listen when you say
“Worry, worry baby?“You might also like2Embed
