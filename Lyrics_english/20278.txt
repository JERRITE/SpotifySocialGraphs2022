Gold Lyrics[Refrain]
Only sunshine, under the bright sky
Only sunshine, under the bright sky

[Pre-Chorus]
When the words are like bullets
And they break through your skin
And there's no way to get them all out
When it feels like rust seeping into your soul

[Chorus]
Stay gold, gold, gold
Stay gold, gold, gold
Stay gold, gold, gold
Under the bright sky, only sunshine
Under the bright sky, only sunshine
[Drop]
Under the bright sky, only sunshine
Stay gold (Gold, gold)
Stay gold (Gold, gold)
Stay gold (Gold, gold)
Stay gold (Gold, gold)
Stay gold (Gold, gold)
Stay gold (Stay gold, gold)

[Verse 2]
You were always searching for something out there
Out of reach, couldn't stop you, couldn't hold you back
You were so real, so real

[Pre-Chorus]
When the words are like bullets
And they break through your skin
And there's no way to get them all out
When it feels like rust seeping into your soul
Stay gold, gold, gold
Stay gold, gold, gold
Stay gold, gold, gold

[Refrain]
Under the bright sky, only sunshine
Under the bright sky, only sunshine
You might also like[Drop]
Under the bright sky, only sunshine

[Outro]
Stay gold (Stay gold, gold)3Embed
