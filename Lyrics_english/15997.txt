Candy Girl (Sugar Sugar) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey!
Shawty you're my candy girl, the kind with the swirls
Oh so good, baby out of this world
Look so sweet, fell in love with your curves
Everytime you speak conversation like syrup
S-U-G-A-R, you ain't her
Oh, honey honey, put money on that bird
Let's keep it in the circle, you everything I deserve
Baby want your sugar, I'm ready to get served
[Chorus]
Sugar! Oh, honey honey
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you
Honey! Oh, sugar sugar
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you

[Verse 2]
I saw this girl, I wanna know her name
She got this body, it's driving me insane
'Cus I need a candy girl
Her kisses rock my world
Long legs, brown eyes
Ain't nobody look fancy girl

[Chorus]
Sugar! Oh, honey honey
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you
Honey! Oh, sugar sugar
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you

[Bridge/Rap]
Say momma won't you do me that favor
I really wanna taste ya
36, 24, 36 flavors
Been around the globe in a laid back nature
Always on my mind shawty be my life savior
Sweet little thang, body insane
She's working that thang
Brown sugar be the name
Candy girl, come get rid of my pain
I think about you all the time
Shawty you should be my dame
You might also like[Chorus]
Sugar! Oh, honey honey
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you
Honey! Oh, sugar sugar
You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you2Embed
