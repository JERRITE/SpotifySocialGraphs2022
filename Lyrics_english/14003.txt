You Overdid It Doll Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard you coming in from town
Stilettos scrape the ground
I saw you in your overcoat
A random on your throat
I know you this is not the girl
That I used to whirl
Round me, what's happening to you
What's happening to you?

[Chorus]
I love it
I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on 'til the day you are done
You will never know when to stop
You'll carry on 'til you're dead and you drop
You will carry on 'til you're dead and you drop
[Hook]
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

[Verse 2]
Your teeth are starting to go
Five nights a week is starting to show
Dark rings around your eyes
Are fashionable until somebody dies
This pace a little too fast
You're a space cadet dressed in fibreglass
You're gonna shatter, it's not too late to undo
Put the fiddle down, the taming of the shrew

[Chorus]
I love it
I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on 'til the day you are done
You will never know when to stop
You'll carry on 'til you're dead and you drop
You will carry on 'til you're dead and you drop

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll

[Chorus 2]
You will never know when to stop
You'll carry on 'til you're dead and you drop
You will carry on 'til you're dead and you drop

[Chorus 3]
I love it
I shoot it like a Tommy gun
But you will carry on 'til the day you are done
Oh you will carry on 'til the day you are done

[Hook]
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it doll
You overdid it dollEmbed
