[Enter: Chino & Nacho, Farruko]
Uoh, uoh
I am falling in love
Those of the romantiqueo
Uoh, uoh
I'm leaving, I'm getting fallen in love
Uoh, uoh (Chino; Chino & Nacho)
I am falling in love (Nacho; Master Celis)
Uoh, uoh (farruko; ey; tainy)
[Verse 1: Chino & Nacho, Farruko]
We barely saw each other
I know we feel brutal and it has me wrong (Yeah-Yeah)
And you smile
Surely you knew what were going to happen to us
(I know that you also feel the same)

[Pre-Caro: Chino & Nacho, Farruko]
This is my way of telling you today
Where you tell me I go
There is such a special place (so special)
Where I would like to be
That special place
Where do you want we kiss and go falling in love

[Chorus: Chino & Farruko]
I am falling in love, uoh, uoh
I am falling in love, uoh, uoh
I'm leaving, I'm going in love, uoh, uoh (Yeah, Chino & Nacho)
I am falling in love, uoh, uoh (Farruko)

[Verse 2: Farruko]
And I don't know if it's your back neckline
Or if it will be the short 'e your skirt
These curves have a hook that catches me (Yeah, Yeah)
On your wings I take off my flight (oh, oh)
Dance with you paste, I want (Yeah, Yeah)
You take me in your arms to heaven

Brutal brutal, you seem great to me
You have a swing, a movement too animal

You are an original lady (wow)

I feel that the clouds' toy caressing
And it is that I am falling in love
