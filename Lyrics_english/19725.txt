Raincoat (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1: Cal Shapiro]
I see you lightin' up your cigarette
Does it burn you like you burn me?
So many nights I've been tryna forget
Do they hurt you like they hurt me?
And all I been thinking about

[Pre-Chorus: Cal Shapiro]
That first night we walked home
You forgot your raincoat and
Now you're here with somebody else
And I know you ain't yourself
[Chorus: Cal Shapiro, Kira Kosarin & Both]
I feel it in my body when you're around
And I know that this party is bringing you down
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No, you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my, feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Oh-oh-ohh
I feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
I can feel it in my body

[Verse 2: Cal Shapiro, Kira Kosarin & Both]
Who is he? Who is she?
'Cause you look so good together
Who is she? Isn't me
You know we were so much better
I know we were so much better
I know, oh-ohh

[Verse 3: Kira Kosarin, Cal Shapiro & Both]
Remember when we wake up in your living room
'Cause we couldn't make it to the bedroom
The next thing I remember, I was loving you
And the smell of your perfume
Is all I keep thinking about
That night at your friend's place
We made out and smoked way too much
And I didn't wanna stay out
So I made up excuses just so we could be alone
Now all I keep thinking about
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Kira Kosarin]
That first night we walked home
I forgot my raincoat on purpose
Now you're here with somebody else
Why is it somebody else? Oh-ohh

[Chorus: Kira Kosarin, Kira Kosarin & Cal Shapiro]
I feel it in my body when you are around
And I know that this party is bringing you down
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body-y
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No, you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I-I can feel it in my, feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Oh-oh-ohh
I feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh I can feel it in my body
I feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
I feel it in my body
I feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh
I can feel it in my body

[Bridge: Kira Kosarin]
The first time we walked home
I forgot my raincoat
The first time we walked home
I forgot my raincoat and
I forgot my raincoat on purpose
[Chorus: Cal Shapiro & Kira Kosarin]
Oh yeah
And I know that this party is bringing you down (Bringing you down)
But you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body, my body
(I can feel it in my, feel it in my body, oh-oh-ohh)
I feel it in my body when you're around
And we both have somebody bringing us down
No, you ain't like nobody, nobody
I feel it in my body
I can feel it in my, feel it in my body

[Outro: Cal Shapiro]
