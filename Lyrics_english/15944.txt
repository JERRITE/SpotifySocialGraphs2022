What a man should know Lyrics [letter of "what a man should know"]

[Verse 1: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
You should know
That when you see me rare
And you ask me, what happens to me?
And I answer you that nothing (ah)
But obvious is nothing (ah)

[Verse 2: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
You should know
That when we fight
And we get angry, when I cry
And I ask you to go (ah)
Poor of you that you go (ah, mm, mm)
[Pre-Caro: Ashley Grace]
If it is not clear to you
Or do not understand the clues
It is not so complicated
I make you a list of ...
The things a man should know

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
Send me a good morning message
Do as if you didn't know
If I tell you something for the third time
Although I do not ask you
Tell me that I look pretty
Although the dress does not close well

[Post-Coro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
NO MINIMITES EVERYTHING I FEEL
You don't know everything about ego
If I summarize it, this is ...
What a man should know
(UH-UH-UH-UH-UH)
(He has!)

[Verse 3: Ashley Grace]
You should know
That when your friends
They send censored photos
Not that I get jealous
But don't see those things
(NO-OH)

And by the way, too
Instead of being entertaining
In the chat with your friends
Go and prepare a dinner
The candlelight

[Pre-Caro: Hanna Nicole]
If it is not clear to you
Or do not understand the clues
It is not so complicated
I make you a list of ...
The things a man should know

[Choir: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
Send me a good morning message
Do as if you didn't know
If I tell you something for the third time
Although I do not ask you
Tell me that I look pretty
Although the dress does not close well

[Post-Coro: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
NO MINIMITES EVERYTHING I FEEL
You don't know everything about ego
If I summarize it, this is
What a man should know
(NO-UH-OH)
(OUH-UH-NO-OH)
[Bridge: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
You should understand what happens to me
Before I tell you what happens
You should know what I want
When sometimes I don't know what I want
Send me flowers for no reason
Soft, soft ear to me
From Mondays to Sundays

[Pre-Caro: Ashley Grace]
If it is not clear to you
Or do not understand the clues
It is not so complicated
I make you a list of ...
The things a man should know
(Yeh-Ih-Yeh-Ih)

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
Send me a good morning message
Do as if you didn't know
If I tell you something for the third time
Although I do not ask you
Tell me that I look pretty
Although the dress does not close well

[Post-Coro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
NO MINIMITES EVERYTHING I FEEL
You don't know everything about ego
If I summarize it, this is
What a man should know

[Outro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
If I summarize it, this is
What a man should ...
(Duh!)
