Brotherhood of the Snake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Coiled forever in the darkness below
They await for the right time to strike
Defending the truth and protecting the lies
Reptilian, shedding their skin
They gather in masses, encrypting the stars
To breed slaves sworn to war
The thrashing and bashing and blistering burns
Death brought forth to the world

[Chorus]
Serpent's eyes, always watching you
Without a trace, the covenant of the snake
Succumbing unto your fate
They've been watching you
Through shape-shift eyes in sumerian disguise
By the gods who decree our faith
By the gods who decree our faith
[Verse 2]
De-luvium religions of monarchs and gods
The hideous hydra takes shape
The bloodline descendants of its original form
The dragon of Egypt awakes
They've taken the tablets and hidden the scrolls
To deceive the ones they protect
The truth of creation, mutation of man
Entombed in the Vatican walls

[Chorus]
Serpent's eyes always watching you
Without a trace, the covenant of the snake
Succumbing unto your fate
They've been watching you
Through shape-shift eyes, in sumerian disguise
By the gods who decree our fate
By the gods who decree our fate
By the gods who decree our fate
By the gods who decree our fate

[Bridge]
Now, we are the ones who dominate (who dominate)
Five thousand years silent control (silent control)
Societies to subjugate (to subjugate)
Eternity complete control (complete control)
The brotherhood of the snake (of the snake)
And they will always assume controlYou might also likeEmbed
