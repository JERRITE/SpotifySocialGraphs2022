Run Donâ€™t Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were the match, I was a flame
Why'd we let it burn out?
Two hearts beating at the same
Time, but look at us now!
Sayin' things we didn't mean
Paved the way to broken dreams
Never meant for you to leave
Don't let this be your story
Take it from me
[Chorus]
Run, don't walk, to the one that you love
Tomorrow isn't promised; whoever said it was?
Oh, run, don't walk, don't you dare look behind
We only get one chance to make it right!
So run
So run
So run
So...

[Verse 2]
Remember when we laid alone
Sharin' secrets that
Nobody else would ever know
But look how it unfolds
Hurt each other just the same
Both refuse to take the blame
Never meant for you to leave
You don't want my misery
Take it from me, yeah!

[Chorus]
Run, don't walk, to the one that you love
Tomorrow isn't promised; whoever said it was?
Oh, run, don't walk, don't you dare look behind
We only get one chance to make it right!
So run
So run
So run
So, ohhhh

Underneath the ugly lies
We had somethin' so beautiful that no one else could touch
Never predicted our demise
If I had one more chance I would run!
Ohhh run
So run
Oh run

[Chorus]
So run, don't walk, to the one that you love
Tomorrow isn't promised; whoever said it was?
Oh, run, don't walk, don't you dare look behind
We only get one chance to make it right!
So run, run, run
So run, run, run
So run, run, run
So run!
So run, run, run
So run, run, run
So run, run, run
So run!
So run!Embed
