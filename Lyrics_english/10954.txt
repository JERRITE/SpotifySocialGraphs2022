Lullaby (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse]
Hypnotize this love out of me
Without your air I can't even breathe
Lead my way out into the light
Sing your lu-lu-lullaby
Cherries in the ashtray
Take me through the day
I just gotta make you a drunken memory
See you in the puddles of my Chardonnay
Sleeping in my bathtub
But can't wash you away
[Chorus]
Keep me safe up in the clouds
'Cause I can't come raining down
Make the monsters sleep in my mind
Sing your lu-lu-lullaby

[Verse]
Hypnotize this love out of me
Without your air I can't even breathe
Lead my way out into the light
Sing your lu-lu-lullaby
Cherries in the ashtray
Take me through the day
I just gotta make you a drunken memory
See you in the puddles of my Chardonnay
Sleeping in my bathtub
But can't wash you away

[Chorus]
Keep me safe up in the clouds
'Cause I can't come raining down
Make the monsters sleep in my mind
Sing your lu-lu-lullabyYou might also likeEmbed
