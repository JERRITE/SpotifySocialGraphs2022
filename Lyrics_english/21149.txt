Damn Regret LyricsThe moon is shining bright
The mood is feeling right
I'll kiss you on your neck
People will stare but we won't care
We're high above the ground
We're nowhere to be found
Empowered by adrenaline
Feel like I'm born again
Again I am repeating myself
And I know it is time for you
To sit and pretend
Damn regret
I'll try to forget
Don't worry about me
'Cause I'll be fine
Cast my line
To see what's behind
Did you think you'd persuade me to let you go?

I'm wishing you were here
My weakness is my fear
Alone I am myself
No reason left for me to care
Distracted by the sound
I hear footsteps all around
Empowered by adrenaline
Feel like I'm born again
Again I am repeating myself
And I know it is time for you
To sit and pretend

Damn regret
I'll try to forget
Don't worry about me
'Cause I'll be fine
Cast my line
To see what's behind
Did you think you'd persuade me to let you go?
You might also likeYou're the only one I turn to
When I feel like no one's there
And when I'm lonely in my darkest hour
You give me the power
To sit and pretend

Damn regret
I'll try to forget
Don't worry about me
'Cause I'm real fine
Cast my line
To see what's behind
Did you think you'd persuaded me to let you go?

Did you think I'd forget?
Did you think I'd surrender myself to persuade you to let me go?

Did you think I'd forget?
Did you think I'd surrender myself to persuade you to let me go?Embed
