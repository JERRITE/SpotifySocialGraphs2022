Sex, modesty and tears Lyrics [letter of "sex, modesty and tears"] 

 Sometimes I don't think 
 I get so cold and I'm not 
 Sometimes I am absent from my feelings 
 And then I smile 
 I remember and cling to living 
 And sometimes I would like to kill for your love 
 Just for a moment 

 And I still can't find 
 What would be normal in me 
 To give you much more 
 And deliver me completely 
 Sex, shame or tears I don't care 
 You want to see me big 
 Despite how weak I am 
 And if I play to the bottom 
 You get me again 
 That's why I stay 
 I cling and I love you to die 
 Therefore, here inside 
 You are all the time 
 Living from suffering 

 And I still can't find 
 What will be normal in me 
 To give you much more 
 And deliver me completely 
 Sex, shame or tears I don't care 

 Sex, modest
