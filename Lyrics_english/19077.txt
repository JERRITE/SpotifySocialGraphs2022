[Enter: Bad Bunny]
YEAH-YEAH, YEAH-YEAH
Yeah-eh, ey, ey
I enjoy being able to see you even if it is not with me (oh-oh-oh), no, hey
I have to settle for being just your friend
Always thinking about your name, alive distracted
I finally fell in love and it turns out that it is forbidden
More live people, but I haven't moved
I'm still stagnant, always dreaming about you
The dm explodes, but I leave them read
My letter 'always have your name and surname
Living with a thousand question ', the pencil' without a tip
Of everything I write, ma ', you have' the fault
I've been paying the same fine for a year
You ere 'that evil that I don't know why I like
Not being able to forget you frustrates me
I swear that I get frustrated
[Chorus: Sech & Mora]
But if you call me I come flying
In the Mercedes I am capsulendo
And when it's not ', I'm still imagining
And without clothes in my bed, my name shouting
And if I call me 'I came flying
In La Mercede 'I am capputing
And when it's not ', I'm still imagining
Without clothes in my bed, my name shouting, oh

[Verse 1: sech]
I'm flying even though I suffer from vertigo (ey)
And if I fall I do not have a medical plan, OH-OH (OH-OH)
With your sinote 'I feel in Mexico (Ey)
With you the doctor medicated me, so come
Forget the past, that the future has' in front
Not only BAD has a "x 100pre"
But I arrive, just tell me (but tell me)
I don't go
Tell me if I shoot the towel
Or if we throw it on the beach
Baby, I'm flying in case the signal fails me (ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus: Mora]
And if I call me 'I came flying
In La Mercede 'I am capputing
And when it's not ', I'm still imagining
Without clothes in my bed, my name shouting, oh

And if I call me 'I fall at the AMG
Baby, to finish what I left
In the bed I did 'a series, but not pg
And although I walked away
I keep watching your face when I put another
If I still have your background wallpaper
I'm without lifeguard 'swimming in the deep
I feel your heartbeat 'although I stay deaf

[Bridge: Mora & Bad Bunny]
And tell me how and that this pain is healed
If I already wash the sheets', but continue with your smell
And I just ask to feel your heat again
I already tried a 'how much', but I miss your flavor (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah, Ey)

[Verse 3: Bad Bunny]
If you call me ', I get more' fast as an emergency '
Pa 'ti there is no competition
When you arrive 'the difference feels
Will it be a curse or coincidence?
With that culot and that face
You ere 'La Mami favorite
If I was 'in Kindergarten I sent you cartita'
I've been on the beach on the beach to see if it takes me away
The 'star' see you and ask for a desire
Baby, you have 'something I see only
I don't want more prize ', I don't want any more trophy'
The only thing I ask and 'tomorrow see you again, he
Even with him
Heaven in hell, nobody will understand
Fleeing what I feel, I got tired of running
In my eye 'it shows, I can't hide it
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
That if you call me 'I came flying
At the time you say ', no matter where and when
And when he is not 'I keep imagining you
Your soul with mine, the do 'Junta' vibrating, ey14embed
