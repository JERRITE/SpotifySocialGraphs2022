[Verse 1]
I went to a place just to think about her
In all the bad that one day I went
I spent the night wanting to see her
Asking that God can convince her

[Pre-car]
I want to have it
In my arms give it my heat
Again protect her
And fill it with all my love
[Chorus]
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me

[Verse 2]
I can live without you but I don't want
Because with you I started from scratch
And if you leave, I can miss
And to lose myself on your lips I prefer
I can live without you but I don't want
Because with you I started from scratch
And if you leave, I can miss
And to lose myself on your lips I prefer

[Chorus]
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me

I want to have it
In my arms give it my heat
Again protect her
And fill it with all my love

[Chorus]
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me
I ask god
Don't miss me
Don't miss me
Without you I don't live
I ask god
Don't miss me
