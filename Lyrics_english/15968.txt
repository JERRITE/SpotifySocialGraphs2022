Giovanni Amore LyricsDecid√≠ travel full of my dreams 
 And run the whole world alone 
 Of snow to the sea, letting me carry 
 Touring history pieces 

 But in Venice something happened to me 
 I was just the same as me 
 He approached and felt in me 
 Electricity downloads 

 Time is leaving 
 Time is leaving 
 And I say, Giovanni Amore 
 I see new colors with you 
 Time is leaving 
 Spiral spiral I feel next to him 
 Taking advantage of every moment of life 
 When I tell you that I have to leave 
 I know it hurts the same as me 
 Giovanni Amore 
 I take you between the memory 
 And my loneliness 

 Time is leaving ... 

 You stay just like me 

 Giovanni Amore ...
