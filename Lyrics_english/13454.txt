Talented women Lyrics [letter of "talented women" ft. Ñejo, Dálmato, J Álvarez, Ñengo Flow, Chyno Nyno & Franco El Gorilla]

[Intro]
Artillery

[Verse 1: Luigi]
If Eva had not eaten the apple (aha)
Life was without malice and much healthier (yes!)
But since that bastard ate the fruit
That's why today there are women so whore '(Do you understand me'?)
They dress teaching the thigh 'and the tits (look pa' there)
They turn back and see the buttocks (Chacha)
Then they say that one is a beautiful and does not respect, punch (safe)
Well, the street does not come out '(Puta!)
The man reaches where the woman leaves him
But some are guils when they dress like weft (that's so)
And if you pite them or piropeas
They run out, but how they want to flirt
(Rice!)
[Chorus: Dalmatian]
I didn't know the talent he had (Nah)
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (Wuh-Hu)
Who would say it, what sugar, so holy that it looked
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (Wuh)

[Verse: Dalmatian]
Hey, my corduroy, you do know (know)
And I have that lock here I have the key (wuh)
I enter you as Juan for his house (Wee-hoo)
And you welcome you, that doubt does not fit
To'as the nights, you know it '
Without losing the pace, without losing the key
I LEAVE IT LOOPEA'O THE BEAT IN REPEAT
That before the sun appears
I converted in a success my new hit

[Verse 2: Ñengo Flow]
Vamo 'to bacillar, give, mommy, don't come in'
Bellaquear with you through my veins runs
Don't take you away, 'give it, give fire to break it
Let me put it after meeting '
Look for your cousin, your friend, your sister
That I walk with Torresabana's combo
Come, cat, I want to give you, behind and ahead
Get to the Sima and the Guayarte buttocks
And you on top of the stage
Starting the tables, which are uploaded
Inside 'e La Cabina Ñengo dominates them
Get out the ankles that vo 'to inject morfina
Secret Weapon (TS, TS), Callaíto, which is secret
Turn off the lu 'to make it complete (ah)
It leaves me 'happy, I come back and I put it
If you leave me I will leave it inside, hahahaha

This is to pass the male that I quickly get
And you who have a face that is going 'to hit the chubs'
That I want to let the boys take care of you
Then I give him a jamaquion and he is going to call the wuacho '
I don't want me to cook, I want gaspacho cod
A dust and I welcome me '[?]
If I stay, I put a boyfriend Chacho
And I don't love you na ', I'm fine drunk

[Verse 4: j alvarez]
Luigi, speaking of course
Tell him I am crazy to eat the hoop
GIVE THE TABLE PUI PA '' LOW
She knows it, that she marks the Gajo
My sister ', yesterday I saw her jangueando in savanna down
I know that you want to be nail '
I already know why you walk with the pry chocha '
I looked at her and she looked more lucid
She wants Bellaqueo, she wants Figa
Do not guils fine, break the routine
And let the Dembow exploit the horn
That is, this is to take long
Give it, move that ass to put your device

[Chorus: Dalmatian]
I didn't know the talent he had (Nah)
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (Wuh-Hu)
Who would say it, what sugar, so holy that it looked
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (Wuh)
[Verse 5: chyno nyno]
I have a girl who likes to drink Cañita
It looks pretty when it is vomited
Crazy, crazy, loquita, the panties take them away
How fresh, it teaches me to 'the hairs of the crice
You do not hear me? Lice-Licenciada
I want to make chaca-chaca to 'the day on the beach
Ultra seven when the outrages
Chynito gives you Deo 'in the bathtub and nails you in the room
To your sister who is united, not to be a charra
That the Guau-Guau does not bite, it only spits your face
The old men who take off the enaguas
That this is the fucke gare ’nobody ties

[Verse 6: Franco El Gorilla]
What is there, my corduroy?
Tell Eva that there is no stick, but the bag is apple
And that if you want Sarana here there is wool and marijuana will not be missing
I also brought rola in case it brings to the sister
And you see Beautiful
It has a transparent, white suit and a blue G-String
Crazy to ride in the Audi, even in the trunk
He saw me skinny and said that I even look like cool, jeh
And I with a pikis pair I have wrapped my mind
I sent them to my corduroy the walker
She likes sushi, but hot meat
And he feels it, the insane is very beautiful

[Chorus: Dalmatian]
I didn't know the talent he had (Nah)
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (Wuh-Hu)
Who would say it, what sugar, so holy that it looked
She grabbed the microphone
Improvisa'o sang, flute blew
And even the melody swallowed (wuh) embed
