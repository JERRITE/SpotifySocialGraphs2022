TranslationsPortuguÃªsMove Together Lyrics[Verse 1]
Home now, end of the night
It's colder to turn on your side
And I know you're up in two hours
But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now

[Chorus]
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
[Verse 2]
And I creep in, and everything's loud
I'm sorry, I've woken you now
And we'll argue the tiniest thing
But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So I'm done whispering, done whispering

[Chorus]
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets

[Bridge]
So maybe don't give me cold, cold shoulder
Before you go, turn around, let me hold you
And let me stay in the dark of the morning
Just one more thing

[Chorus]
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace
Just keeping the peace between these sheetsYou might also like15Embed
