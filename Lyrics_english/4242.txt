My mistake Lyrics [lyrics by "my mistake"]

[Pre-car: Zion]
(Wuh)
Before 'I was looking for me ’, Baby
When I was on the street (when I was on the street)
He does not love me 'as before, Baby
What happened to your detail '? (What happened in your detail ’?)
And I don't know what I did
But forgive me if I failed you (-tell me if I failed you)
Look at him in the eye, tell me something, don't stop
[Chorus: Zion]
I hope you fall in love '
You fall in love with someone like you
Pa 'who knows' how much your fuck'
(Pa 'know' how much your fuck ’)
I hope and break your heart
And I know I can look for improvement ’
Baby, you left for no reason
But one grows learning from the error '

[Post-Coro: Eladio Carrión & Zion, both]
You were my favorite mistake, oh
Today I got up in a bad mood and I need you
I would like you to be on top of me
In your favorite underwear, your color, favorite
Please do not leave me that I have seen you naked

[Break instrumental]

[Verse: Eladio Carrión & Zion]
(Naked) Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ey-yao ', baby, tell me how are you
I don't want to know who you come with or leave
The same, I know you have Pales behind
But today I need you and you don't look back

I miss you, if I tell you no
I deceive me, ma'i, just tell me
The damage was already done (oh, oh)
And I see that he does not want 'commitment

[Chorus: Zion & Eladio Carrión]
I hope you fall in love '
You fall in love with someone like you
Pa 'who knows' how much your fuck'
(Pa 'know' how much your fuck ')
I hope and break your heart
And I know that I can look for improvement '
Baby, you left for no reason
But one grows learning from the error '
