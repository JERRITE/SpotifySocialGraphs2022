The Next Time Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
One too many goals
The measure of your worth
Can sink your weight in gold
Sat by the ivory sill
The further out you look
The further out you'll be

[Chorus]
It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured, nothing earned
Though odds are set against
In time, I'll belong to you, it's how it's meant to be

[Verse 2]
Settled on your own
Sweeping dust from stone
With a letter home
Back where the hour's long
The simplest things invite a thrill
If just by noticing at will

[Chorus]
It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured, nothing learned
It's how it's always been

[Bridge]
E onde a sorte há de te levar, saiba o caminho é o fim mais que chegar
E queira o dia ser, gentil a tua mão, aberta pra quem é

[Outro]
In time, I'll belong to you
That's how it's meant to be, and how it's always beenYou might also like2Embed
