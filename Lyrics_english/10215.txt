SELF-SABOTAGE Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we talk, I'm never wrong
And if we don't fight, it won't last long
Might unplug my phone at night
When you need me most, I'll miss that flight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's avoidable, I'll destroy chances to be
Better than I was before you and me
Now we're at the part where you'll hate what you see
What the fuck is wrong with me?
[Chorus]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yеah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'll piss you off and ask what's wrong
And your reason's not good enough, no, no
I want this to work so bad
But I want what I can't havе, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Make plans and break them to see what you say
And then I'll be upset when you're mad for the day
'Cause you put on makeup and I'm still in bed
What the fuck is wrong with me?

[Chorus]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me?4Embed
