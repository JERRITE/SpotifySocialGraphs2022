Jump Right In Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Verse 1]
Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
[Verse 2]
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Bridge]
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
A simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by

[Chorus]
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby
