River Water LyricsWe had enough
To last a couple of days
We found a place
To park and set on our way
We walked for miles
And left the path far behind
We found a place
By the riverside
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water
We spent the night
Under the stars all alone
And it was like
Nothing else that I've ever known
And all we heard
Was the sound of the wind through the trees
And all we felt
Was the chill off the water in a breeze
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced in the River Water

Now you're waiting for me on the shore
There's nothing else I'm asking for
Don't you want to Dixie Swim?
Come on and jump right in
And we danced..
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced in the River Water
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced in the River WaterYou might also likeEmbed
