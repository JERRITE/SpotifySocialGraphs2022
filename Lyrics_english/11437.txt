Silver Raven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have you seen the silver raven?
She has wings and she can fly
Far above the darkened waters
Far above the troubled sky

Have you seen the changing rivers?
Now they wait their turn to die
But they turn their tide upon you
When the sea begins to cry
[Verse 2]
Have you seen the changing windows
Of the sea beyond the stars?
And the sky beyond the sunbeams
And the world beyond your dreams

Have you seen the old world dying
Which was once what new world seem?
Have you seen the silver raven?
She has wings that barely gleam

[Verse 3]
They barely gleam, they barely glimmer
As she circles past the sun
And she tries to tell her sister
That her trials have just begun

[Guitar Solo]
