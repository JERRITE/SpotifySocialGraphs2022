Utopia lyrics [lyrics "utopia"]

[Intro: Miyagi]
Yeah, Yeah
Andy, Miyagi
Hajime!

[Verse 1: miyagi]
The weight of this plan, which is so carelessly
Destroyed the pile of the right one with him
Parasitic words shot in the darkness of a deaf, pitch
I wanted to click on Stop, but this is not a movie to you
From time immemorial, the peace of the gods was impossible at all
The tidbit of a piece was changed to a piece of soul
I have seen a sight here, because someone is True, and someone is eating for True, but does not take it out
If your thoughts are clean, you prove it
What kind of people went and went? I vouch, I need
I would give free rein to you, they would burn me at the stake
I will also live and rejoice in snowfall again
And wait for you only good news from you
[Chorus: Miyagi]
In the metropolis forgotten by God, I destroyed
Stereotypes of crammed people.
You carefully destroy yourself, why do you
Vaiba of my dubious translation, translation?
Time ran away, he was ahead
Without looking, I will restore order, thought and wondered
Isn't it too much my marvelous utopia
A naive dreamer, they say, I'm like a bob, I'm like a bob?

[Verse 2: andy panda]
Sunrise breaks through the window
Ya-man, our people at the same time
Lifestyle, it's all a foregone conclusion
My bit, my block is my everything
Time in a sawn -off shotgun (time)
Favorite, God bless (beloved, God bless)
We give everything that is (we give everything that is)
This is our honor (this is our honor)
Pull our hands to the sun (pull our hands to the sun)
To the yellow stranger (to the yellow stranger)
People fly there (people fly there)
No one will forget you (no one will forget you), and
Little bright lights, I'm stuck
Before us are the stars, packed, look
Release steam, you want to release smoke
Our tears are water, our days are a movie
Evil is karma, don't visit
Rain outside the window, all year round autumn
Day of Day (Day Day)
Utopia and me (utopia and me)
