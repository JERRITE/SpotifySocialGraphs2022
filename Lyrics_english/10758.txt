ATTENTION POLITICIAN Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wanna skip through pages, can’t complain
Still I can manage, memories unmade
You quick to change up like a bandit
Would have followed you around anywhere else
On the planet, dear

[Chorus]
So do you think about me?
Do you ever think?
What do you think about me?
Do you ever think?
[Post-Chorus]
It’s so hard to come to grips like this
If I wanted truth, this life is it
But if I wanted you, there goes my end
It’s so hard to come to grips like this
If I wanted truth, this life is it
If I wanted you, there goes my end

[Verse 2]
Played it hard to get, ain’t with the shit
Guess I don’t blame you, since I hit the deck
Lots to forget, a lot stayed the same too
You’re lost in the sense to rage against
The ones who crave you, dear?

[Chorus]
So do you think about me?
Do you ever think?
What do you think about me?
Do you ever think?

[Bridge]
I’ll admit to you, this was my always fantasy
But it slips between what I wanted and have known myself to be
Alone or with you there, cruel urge for something more
But I can’t be sure I’m still following your lead
You might also like[Chorus]
So do you think about me?
Do you ever think?
What do you think about me?
Do you ever think?

[Outro]
Ring my telephone
What, what, what
I’m in another zone
What, what, what
Catch a vibe on my own
What, what, what
Catch a vibe on my own
What, what
You find me
In the middle of the night
What, what, what
I rang a million times
What, what, what
So what, what
Yeah, what, what
So what, what
Yeah, whatEmbed
