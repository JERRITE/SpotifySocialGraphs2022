TranslationEnglish Is she more than me? Lyrics [verse 1]
Do not put conditions, enough hypocrisies
I am the woman, you the man, alone in front of life
A couple of hearts looking for love
Do not say no to me

[Verse 2]
I want to enter your eyes
And see who you breathe for
I want to know everything
Truth or fantasy
Tell me who caresses you better than me
[Pre-car]
Who do you dream love with?
Who separates you from me?
Who steals the heat of your body, by God
Even if you suffer

[Chorus]
She is more than me ... she
Tell me what gives you, I don't give you ... she
Is it in her what do you think by me?
I need to know if you want her
She is more than me ... she
Tell me the truth

[Verse 3]
Always with your apologies that do not apologize
With that absurd grimace floating by your face
Take off your mask, feel like

[Pre-car]
Who do you dream love with?
Have you tired of me?
Who steals the heat of your lips love?
Even if I cry

[Chorus]
She is more than me ... she ...
Tell me what gives you, I don't give you ... she
Is it in her what do you think by me?
I need to know if you want her
She is more than me ... she
Tell me the truth
You might also like her more than me ... she
She is more than me ... she, she
She is more than me ... shembed
