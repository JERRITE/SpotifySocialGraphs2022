I’m Not A Mountain Lyrics(La da da da da da)

If I could choose the things that I knew
And all the things that I'd see
I'd let the room fill with memories until
The walls were staring at me

The mystery of life is just taking flight
I watch the walls closing in
So I swallow my pride and I take another bite
I guess I'm dreaming again
I swear I'm unattached
Living in the past but
I can't get off my feet
You say we'll all go mad
But I don't believe that
So you'll prove it to me

(La da da da da da)

If I could choose, I'd never lose
I'd always take without giving
I wrote down the truth in letters to you
But I know you'll never get them

If I were a mountain, I'd stand my ground
And maybe I'd never listen
But if I were a mountain, I'd close my mouth and
Maybe I'd be forgiving

But I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not

I'm not a mountain
I can't hold you on my own
I'm not a mountain
I will crumble when you go
There in the square, my arms in the air
And is it so bad to be alone?
You might also likeI can do it on my own

(I'm not- I'm not a mountain)
(I'm not- I'm not a mountain)

Is it really so bad?
Is it really so bad?
I can do it on my own3Embed
