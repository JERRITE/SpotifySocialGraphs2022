Push it to the limit lyrics [intro]
Yeah, Ah

[Part 1]
Boss rapper, Showtime, Bitch, Highness does not front (bitch)
Because beef is not without complication with me (Kid)
Like your surgical intervention
If you are sent the emergency doctor because my shotgunpatron hits you
Boss fashion, the Versace socks
Fit like a glove like concrete from Mafia bosses
Groupies run after me, chalk glue like drug junks
I hold the women at a distance like Army-Sniper Browning-Guns
They are just a bunch of sluts that just put it on it
Like the overbosses Himelfe, the numerous millions on the banks
And you have had a terrible life since childhood? (AW)
Already as a young hop, like a kangaroo baby? (AW)
Always the same lyre (TZHE) as with Turkish pop ballads
None in the mood for this shit, I give you 'n Kirmes-Boxer hook
Now your pumpkin head is beaten
That you fly up a comic-like vertically out of your birch stick sandals
[Hook]
Still the boss (boss)
Kripos on the block, Mios by fabric (yeah)
Push it to the limit (push)
Still the boss (boss)
Kripos on the block, Mios by fabric (yeah)
Push it to the limit (push)
The money counting machine is running, push it to the limit
Choose my stacks, blow 'the kush in the sky
The money counting machine is running, Push it to the limit (yeah, ah)
Choose my stacks, blow 'the kush in the sky

[Part 2]
Hustle a day (Ah), Hustle at night
I continued to hand over like a relay sprint team
Hidden in the leather sofa fabric (fabric)
Never went out without the telescopic stroke, thought every month
"Soon I'll be motionless on the block" (Safe)
Now my future is under a sparkling star like my Mercedes engine block (bling)
Ah, I show my property to the people (ah)
And hear the amazed murmur among the people present
Ey, the boss comes with Koks Mafia relatives (yeah)
Criminal energy, like when your broker bastard father taps electricity with the neighbor
Business runs for me like Weiber on the neighborhood (Kiez)
Drink no alk, but buy an entire wine growing area simply on principle
Parka from Prada with ermine collar
If you put on a parka, then with the loan tam (yeah)
The tuxedo hangs in the closet next to rifles and skim masks
I came to the top through crooked ways - serpentine streets
You might so like [Hook]
Still the boss (boss)
Kripos on the block, Mios by fabric (yeah)
Push it to the limit (push)
Still the boss (boss)
Kripos on the block, Mios by fabric (yeah)
Push it to the limit (push)
The money counting machine is running, push it to the limit
Choose my stacks, blow the kush in the sky
The money counting machine is running, push it to the limit
Choose my stacks, blow 'the kush in the sky
