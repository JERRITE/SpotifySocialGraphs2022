You're naturally mine
You're naturally mine
You're naturally mine
You're naturally mine

Tell me
Why do I, baby, love you? Yes, I do (Loving, loving you)
Please take my hand
Won't you understand girl?
I'm loving you and needing you more
(No, no. no, no)
[Chorus]
You're naturally mine (Yes, you are; yes, you are)
You're naturally mine (No, no, no, no)
You're naturally mine (Yes, you are; yes you are; yes, you are)
You're naturally mine (Hold me in your arms)

[Verse 2]
Tell me
Why do you, baby, treat me the way you do? (Treat me the way you do)
You know I loved you from the start
You turned away and broke my heart
You got me feeling like I'm in the clouds (No, no, no)
Why, why, why, oh why, oh why do I need you the way I do? (No, no, no, no, no)
You got me wanting you, I desire you
My heart's on fire for you, girl
So don't you ever go away, yeah

[Chorus]
You're naturally mine (Yes, you are; yes, you are, yes, you are)
You're naturally mine (Please don't go away, my baby)
You're naturally mine (Stay with my lady)
(No, no, no, no)
You're naturally mine (Don't you leave me tonight)

Oh, no no, you've captured my heart, girl
Not this time. not again, no
I do care always to share my love with you again, ooh, hoo
Why, oh why, why, oh why do I need you the way I do? (No, no, no, no, no no)
You got me wanting you, I desire you
My heart's on fire for you, girl
(Hmm, I need you {No, no, no, no} for the rest of my life)
