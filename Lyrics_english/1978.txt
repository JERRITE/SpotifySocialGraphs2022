Finally Falling Lyrics[Intro]
Suddenly, my choice is clear
I knew when only you and I were standin' here

[Verse 1]
Well, that money isn't worth a thing
If you didn't earn it, you don't deserve it
True love doesn't cost a thing
And if you try to buy it, you can't return it
(No, no, no, oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Your friends are doin' all the same things
And my friends say, "Look at what you're wastin'"
Well, it doesn't matter if we change their minds

[Chorus]
Suddenly, I can see what I didn't before
And I don’t care what they say anymore
'Cause I'm fallin', fallin'
Finally fallin', fallin'

[Verse 2]
I don't need all the finer things, diamond rings are nothin'
So show me somethin'
'Cause love is all I need, all I ever wanted
And now I've got it (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And my friends all wonder what you're thinkin'
And your friends, they probably think the same thing
Well, it doesn't matter if we change their minds

[Chorus]
Suddenly, I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
'Cause I'm fallin', fallin'
Finally fallin', fallin'

If you can't find love when you're in it, just forget it
It will change your mind once you get it, don't you get it?
'Cause we did it (We did it, we did it)
Yeah, we did it (We did it, we did it)
Well, we did it (We did it, did it, did it, did it)

[Chorus]
Suddenly, I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
'Cause I’m fallin', fallin' (Fallin', fallin')
Finally fallin', fallin'
Suddenly, I can see what I didn't before
And I don't care what they say anymore
'Cause I'm fallin', fallin' (Fallin', fallin')
Finally fallin', fallin'

[Outro]
Finally fallin', fallin' (Just fallin', fallin')
Finally fallin', fallin' (Just fallin', fallin')Embed
