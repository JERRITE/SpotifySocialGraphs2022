Wrong Side of A Love Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where were you
When I needed a friend
Thought I could be strong
Never knew I'd be so wrong
A heartbreaker
Most of my life
Suddenly it all changed
The moment you left me and walked out my life
Tried to play cool
But instead I was playing myself
What you gotta know about me
Is I'm dying in this lonely hell
[Hook]
And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can hardly breathe without ya
This is what it feels to be the one that's standing left behind
How did I become the wrong side of a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm a mess
Out of every piece and part of me
You were always the best
But instead I was leaving you here alone
But I didn't mean it
No I didn't mean it
Now I'm begging baby come home
And he got me saying "Why
Why you wanna make me cry
I've been thinking bout you
Got me dreaming bout you
Every single day and night"

[Hook]
And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can hardly breathe without ya
This is what it feels to be the one that's standing left behind
How did I become the wrong side of a love song
You might also like[Bridge]
How, Baby, Wanna know why
Can you tell me why
Said that you'll be there for me
Said you'll care for me
So how you gonna say goodbye

[Hook]
And I don't wanna be without you
Cause I can hardly breathe without ya
This is what it feels to be the one that's standing left behind
How did I become the wrong side of a love song
