I botle lyrics [lyrics by "you boté"]

[Intro: Nio García]
I spend my nights thinking about you (child)
Here in my bed surprising you (ay, ay, ay, ay)
And where do I go everything I remember
After all I already tired

[Choir: Nio Garcia & Darell]
I drove me, and I bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pa'l fuck I sent you, I sent you
And from my life I took you out, I took you away (this is the true return, oi'te baby?)
Baby I bot
[Verse 1: Darell]
Baby I bot (hah)
And since I gave you that 'Botá', the cat 'are tre' in tre '(that's so)
If you want 'ask if you don't believe me' (Baby)
That I no longer have rough '(Baby)
Pa 'complete the row are express (hah-hah)
And how did the world go to Revé '?
And I with her in RD (haha-ha)
I fell in love with the day I tried it
I don't think I come back and give you
Mommy, because the service was canceled
If I do not respond (HUH) the problem will turn background
Mommy, breathe deep while I hide it (that's so)
With you, forced, I put the condom
But postia'o at mid -court, baby, like Rondón (Huh)
I give you a hard burial (that's so)
I know that over time the wound is cured (by law)
E 'that in Verdá' e 'that you are not' at that height (huh)
I swear to you, although I did not swear
(Ra-ta-ta!)

[Chorus: Darell, Nio García & Casper Magic]
Baby, I bothered you (it's that I drove you)
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you (I gave you a band and released you, so you know ')
Pa'l fuck I sent you, huh, huh (are you not understanding what we are wanting to say?
From my life I took you, huh, eh (this is the true turn, we are the magical, baby, real g4 life, casper ¡hey!)

Pa'l fuck I bot (Wouh!)
I feel good (ah)
I no longer suffer for Amore ', now Romo Corazone' and there are plenty
You broke my heart (you broke my heart, Wouh!)
Without meaning and without reason (meaningless and without reason, ah)
But I have a new ass that gives me a lot of love and fuck me well bastard (uh, good bastard)

[Chorus: Casper Magic & Nio García]
I didn't vary it that I suffered, I had a bad time
But I overcome you and from my life I bot (I bot)
And I gave you a band and I released you (and I released you)
And I don't want to know (I want to know)
And for the damn I sent you; Today I'm going to drink (drink, magic, child)

[Verse 3: Nio García]
I gave you trust and you failed me
You made fun of me and you humiliated me
Far from here you left and you didn't explain
Dress my movie and you went
Now you want to know what I think about you
I feel bastard because you are not here
Just as you came you can go (you can go)

[Chorus: Nio García, Nio García & Casper Magic, Darell & Casper Magic]
I'm not going to deny that I suffered, I had a bad time
But I overcame and my life bot, and I bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
And I don't want to know about you (Pa'l I sent you; and I don't want to know about you)
And from my life I took you, I took you
Baby, I bot
