Guasa, Guasa Lyrics [letter from "Guasa, Guasa"]

[Intro]
You are guasa-guasa, guasa-guasa
(They are a whop ', my lyrical cohíba)
You are guasa-guasa, guasa-guasa
(Is that you do not see with a trangalanga)
You are guasa-guasa, guasa-guasa
(They are nobody if they do not throw, they hear me and surmilla)
You are guasa-guasa, guasa-guasa
(Each abuser comes his calderon'a)
[Verse 1]
If you want to throw someone, go to me
I am the enemy, I do not ask chantilly salsa
I'm going to find my troupe
You wear D.E.M.O, but Calde is the one who fits them
You don't get to me ', make up with the chanz (aha)
And don't fuck my throat (no)
In your list was not this lylicist
If you can't ', your partner or look
With his old flow like voodoo
Old man like Bugalú
The bad guasibiriboo
Timao de prisoner in his songs (hehe)
But they do not live in ambitions
If you dare to give me, give me (ah)
Vo'anar zipper down for what before me I mame
A lot of letter 'soup, from', I am an old man
They border on balls, but they are afraid
They are nobody if they do not throw, they hear me and surmilla
They walk a whop ', my lyric' the cohíba

[Chorus]
What crazy bullets like Sam Bigote
Blowpote is the owner of Mazacote
Hey, I'm killer, more monster than Thriller's
The Mato de Drivito 'as Reggie Miller
What crazy bullets like Sam Bigote
Blowpote is the owner of Mazacote
I am killer, more monster than those of thriller
The Mato de Drivito 'as Reggie Miller
Hey, you are guasa-guasa, guasa-guasa
You are guasa-guasa, wraps dough

If Sumbas of the same, what do you want 'what to tell you?
They do not realize that they do not give the league
With the same guasimilla, trying to put goat
But it is a lot of bark and that is when they bleed
Hey, I already noticed that they are little '
I didn't even know that it was lending ', the grenade, blessed
Set a bow different from mine
You know that I am more up to date
Pa 'you kick me there are more people
Maradona is metadonne and you are very berrigone
What punches you 'do with your dirty glock?
Crazy fucking, with me I short them
Do not threaten me, whatever I am doing
Then don't come trying to make passes
You are not a street, you know, leave the Aguaje
Do not make me in detail (hey)
Is that I know that he likes how I put him
Pa 'mi you were more to the stick, when you were with the other prieto
Low of the cloud, your liricas are rubber
Yan Pujuler, the Freddy Krueger arrived
If the public believes them, joy bomb is
Pa 'the Top Reggae Pinocchos
What I release is moreucamba, for it to get
Is that you are not breasting with a trangalanga
Cartoons that do not stick with Krazy glue
I have no yacht, nor BMW
But I sing much more than you (Aha)
And you spent fashion like bamboo
Speaking of course, this pa 'to' the gandules
Each abuser arrives his calderon'a
Now hold on, daddy, the thing swallows
I already told you that grampa arrived '
[Chorus]
What crazy bullets like Sam Bigote
Blowpote is the owner of Mazacote
Hey, I am killer, more monster than Thriller's
The Mato de Drivito as Reggie Miller
What crazy bullets like Sam Bigote
Blowpote is the owner of Mazacote
I am killer, more monster than those of thriller
The Mato de Drivito as Reggie Miller

[Post-car]
(Hey) novice lyric that takes your peanut, potato
Zulu as Shaka
Hey, and I got the gabana (I who put myself the—)
But I don't like drama, that's not my fame
You are more ghostly than Moncho Artuaga
The one who does it to me (pays it for me)

Hears! (I am killer, more monster than Thriller's)
(The Mato de Far as Reggie Miller)

[Outro]
Now hold on
The one who does it to me (pays it for me)
Hears! (Hold!)
The thing is tranca
(Hold) the one who makes it pays for me (I la-)
(Endures) Zulu as Shaka
(Bowl, endures) Hey, I put the gabana
(Blowpote, endures) Hey, I am killer-Killer-Killer
If you want to throw someone go to me
Take me to me, go to me, go to me, go to me
(Each abuser comes his calderon'a) embed
