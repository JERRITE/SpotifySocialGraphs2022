Livinâ€™ Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sailin' away
On the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin'
And slippin' & slidin'
It's magic

[Pre-Chorus]
And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby
[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
(I'm taking a dive, dive)

[Verse 2]
Making believe
This is what you conceived
From your worst day (I'm taking a dive)
Oh, moving in line
Then you look back in time
To the first day (I'm taking, I'm taking)

[Pre-Chorus]
And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
(I'm taking a dive on the slide, hey)
You might also like[Verse 3]
Takin' a dive
'Cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm taking a dive)
Oh, so let her go
Don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm taking, I'm taking)

[Pre-Chorus]
And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

[Chorus]
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose9Embed
