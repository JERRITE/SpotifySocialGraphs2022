Rise Up [SmackDown! Theme] Lyrics[Verse 1]
I will sit right here and bide my time
As longs as it takes to get what's rightfully mine
(what's rightfully mine)
And I won't be denied, cause all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Break it out, break you down
Breaking rules, breaking ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
All you take, all you've done
(I moved on)
[Verse 2]
Well I will sit right here and I will wait (will wait)
Patiently for your last big mistake
And I won't be denied cause all I've got left is my pride
And I  will rise up

Break it out, break you down
Breaking rules, breaking ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
All you take, all you've done
I control my own fate
As for you, it's too late
It's my dream, it's my way
It's my mind, it's your pain


[Verse 3]
And I won't be denied
Cause all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up
Break it out, break you down
Breaking rules, breaking ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
All you take, all you've done

And I won't be denied
You might also likeAnd I won't be denied
Cause all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up
Break it out, break you down
Breaking rules, breaking ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
All you take, all you've doneEmbed
