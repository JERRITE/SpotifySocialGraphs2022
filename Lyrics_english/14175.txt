Consoler of the Lonely Lyrics[Intro]
"Daddy, will you tell me the story about the chickens again?"

[Verse 1]
Haven't seen the sun in weeks
My skin is getting pale
Haven't got a mind left to speak
And I'm skinny as a rail
Light bulbs are getting dim
My interests are starting to wane
I'm told it's everything a man could want
And I shouldn't complain
Conversations getting dull
There's a constant buzzing in my ears
Sense of humor's void and null
And I'm bored to tears
I'm bored to tears, yeah
I'm bored to tears, yeah

[Bridge]
If you're looking for an accomplice
A confederate, somebody's who's helpless
You're gonna find, you'll find yourself alone
If you're looking for cut-throat
Singing above note, looking for a scapegoat
You're gonna find, you'll find yourself alone
Looking for sympathy
I can get you something
Something good, something good to eat

[Verse 2]
Haven't had a decent meal
My brain is fried
Haven't slept a week for real
My tongue is tied

My interests are starting to wane
I'm told it's everything a man could want
And I shouldn't complain
Conversations getting dull
There's a constant ringing in my ears
Sense of humor's void and null
And I'm bored to tears
I'm bored to tears, yeah
I'm bored to tears, yeah
