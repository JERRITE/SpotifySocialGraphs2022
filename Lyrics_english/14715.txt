Wolf Garou Lyrics [Words of "Wolf Garou" ft. Sofiane]

[Intro: Sofiane]
Check

[Verse 1: Sofiane]
We are going to smoke pork, we will eat shit, more time, don't surprise you that we are subcontracting violence
And my victims will explain the dangers of feat, rappers cemetery, real insolence
I spread my cosmos, the stars say: "Amen"
At the top of the Empire, Vivendi, the hour of the shadow and guessing that brings back?
We can convince everyone that we have changed but never yourself
Pour a little blood to blush the button, Hashtag "Wolf-Garou" under sheep's skin (what?)
Under the mask of the nice fianso, it was me
You don't lend allegiance, we tear you away from your mother
It's Lord Voldemort, no need to lie
I arrive on the pegasus back industry to charm the wizards, drink the blood of vampires
Forgive the hobbits from the top of my tower (humble), contact with antimatière (tragic)
Do not bring the condes in the oven (simple), brother, we will take your mother (basic) you
Cali cartel, what shit dumpling? We bring you the geode
There is only one godfather for all of Italy, at 33 of the Scottish Rite, MacLeod
I am the abscissa, disorderly, scritch and myself to slip into the panel
Slaughter a lamb, measures the shock, a circle, a ring to govern them all
I have read my future in a re-pu litron: with the family that we bleed, with the family that we win
Choose something else that is not meeting, I am a kabyle, I come from the mountains (check)
Rafale in Kamis, we drink k-bis, the abyss accompanies me
Potato in Batman without accessories or capes
Your blaze on my black list and end of the story, blow of pumps
I do without color, too slow enemies, drugwide transacs, remix, do the deal
A magic wand, a flying broom, pfff, glock, gsx-r1000
I said "endolori", I turn on touching, under the moon, sunset, I have the impacts in the chest
Good manufacture, Go Go Gadgeto-Pompe, Chevrotine Transformers at General Motors
And sooner or later, the prince becomes the king's enemy, I will sit down but have died
I have a taste for power, eighth and you thought you had but I'm sorry
Fianso
[Refrain: Gims]
My little wolf, my little wolf, stay there, it becomes che-lou
My little wolf, my little wolf, move away, there is a werewolf
My little wolf, my little wolf, stay there, it becomes che-lou
[Verse 2: GIMS]
I'm going to break your neck
Because life made me blows me and I don't stop taking my head with people who think they know me like my parents, yeah, I'm paro '
I am amazing little love, I still haven't found the words
Is it Waraoui or Warano? Tell me, what is there after death?
It's Fuego, dinneros, it's the UNO, my number
For Adama Diallo, Poulo, we started it underwater, underwater
Solo in the zoo, avoiding the zonz, ninth was the area and it scratches at home
It comes very, very serious, the demon jerks off when the men get lost
Let's stay on our guard, I don't think we are in a gad sketch
Your name is Agathe, let me tell you that hugs, it matches me
And men like to see that the legs go away and that everything spoils like in Kattegat
Ok, tell me, what do you want? Failing to say to you: "Buffer, what are you worth?"
A little sorrel to experience your go, get the passage, here is Gustavo
We are not going to be a lot, say that everything is beautiful, I will say who you are if you empty your pockets
Come on, lack of pot, your name is Sakho and there, necessarily, it's the eco class'
I never dropped my pants, I never put heels
I'm going to break your phalanges, you'll see how funny
I'm gambled like a stallion, the baron, Daron des Donons, are you?
Come on, we're talking about Whatsapp, I'm on listening, better whisper
The manager anticipated that the little bitch was going to screenshot
Well, it's me, the one that sacem can no longer pay
French, French, I arrive in peace, 190k on the wrist
You came to the world before shame, I give you the time, you want to take the watch
Vineurs become singers, we are not going to be caught as with the Jenner
At thirty-two rods, you're not 'se-po', you are afraid to take a parigot
Two kids later, suddenly, she tells you that she is a prostitute of Pizza Pino
They want to switch me off, paint me, even undress, m'scier
Because they think the NBA tickets
Posed at 'oi-m' side fireplace ... Ah, like what to get you
You're not at all, it's my fucking job
Please go back, curl up on you because you are not even invited
I am not going to investigate, to bend, ask the West Indians, I am a guy too whole
Then close your mouth while you are, you walk on my fucking path
You thought you could get out of it, I'm going to attract you, bury you, tart you, we spot you
Ninety thirteen, twelve, Essonne, Tarterêts
You might also like [Refrain: Gims]
My little wolf, my little wolf, stay there, it becomes che-lou
My little wolf, my little wolf, move away, there is a werewolf
My little wolf, my little wolf, stay there, it becomes che-lou13embed
