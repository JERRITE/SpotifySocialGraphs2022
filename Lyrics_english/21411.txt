Drilled to Kill Lyrics[Intro]
We're drilled to kill
We're drilled to kill

[Verse 1]
They say you are wanted
You're a wanted man
Come and sign the paper
Let me count you in
Well, it looks like a holiday but we protect the Earth
Sailing distant oceans, it's all worth
[Pre-Chorus]
Sealed by the navy
Cross the line of fire

[Chorus]
Mute all emotions
Looking for the thrill
So close to overdosing
We've been drilled to kill

[Post-Chorus]
We're drilled to kill
We're drilled to kill

[Verse 2]
Rеligion is the order
Stick right to the rulеs
Sail on, sailor, anywhere
On this ship of fools
We are on a mission, questions won't be posed
Load your gun, we're gettin' there, battlefield is close

[Pre-Chorus]
Sealed by the navy
Cross the line of fire
You might also like[Chorus]
Mute all emotions
Looking for the thrill
So close to overdosing
We've been drilled to kill
Who cares for the enemy?
Already on the hill
Say a prayer, a last will
'Cause we've been drilled to kill

[Chorus]
Mute all emotions
Looking for the thrill
So close to overdosing
We've been drilled to kill

[Verse 3]
They say you are wanted
You're a wanted man
Come and sign the paper
Let me count you in
Well, it looks like a holiday but we protect the Earth
Sailing distant oceans, it's all worth

[Chorus]
Mute all emotions
Looking for the thrill
So close to overdosing
We've been drilled to kill
Who cares for the enemy?
Already on the hill
Say a prayer, a last will
'Cause we've been drilled to killEmbed
