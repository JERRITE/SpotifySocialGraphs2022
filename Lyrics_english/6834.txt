WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
I can meet unit i say the names

[Chorus]
I do loops on the Bultex
Yet I don't want to wake up
I have the rinnegan
I'm under liquid anger
I put a big sword in the next showcase
Imbecile from there, I have the demon
I fulfill the list to delight me names
Fuck losing life in the shadows
Shit I broke the neon
[Verse 1]
Look at my heart I am injured
Senju cell, I am vegetable
Forty dungeons on the CV
He wrote my name on the PC
Double-MÃ©ga Zinzin for a shock price
Helico jump, I put a trickshot
Talisman protects me on the canoe
I am a powerful sorcerer of the worst kind
Stop time but not stop growing
Reverse the hourglass to let them fill up
I broke the seal
I open the ninth door without fucking my back
I came to kiss everything like bread
I left, I left everything as such
You're so frozen that hatred is consuming you
I am going to do it without showing you my pair of pumps
Exo 100 on the warhead in the sampler
We are several trapped in the temple
Apparently he rubbed the lamp
Lying makes him heat his tongue
I'm a wolf fox, I don't have time to miss
In the Paki, Afghan Paki, Amne
I'm not very talkative
I want to stay alone in the oval palace
In the Golden Salle

[Chorus]
I do loops on the Bultex
Yet I don't want to wake up
I have the rinnengan
I'm under liquid anger
I put a big sword in the next showcase
Imbecile from there, I have the demon
I fulfill the list to delight me names
Fuck losing life in the shadows
Shit I broke the neon

[Verse 2]
I have one last prayer in front of the altar
You make the fireworks but you have no machine
I have a feeling, I feel like the
Only that guy opposite is not Yagami
Beyond dreams there is a large castle
Inside there is hash who recounts the treasure
We pretend to have seen nothing while waiting for the cheite to go up the decor
2018, humans are a little less humans
Than apple juice in the bottle
I want my palate in the good place
2018, the planet is a little less a planet
The bad guys are a little more bad guys in real life
We need a little less a planet
Holo is invented in the meta-mogle
Includes the world in fourteen dimensions
Modesty is already dead
The face of your soul is ugly ugly
A large white stone, my name on marble
To see further I am moving on the mast, hey
I mocke only I have an eleven on the arm
