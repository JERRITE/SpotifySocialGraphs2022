Timelapse Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's not enough hours in a day
Got no time to throw away
When all I wanna do
Is spend my days just getting to know you
The pressure, it always just seems to grow
And everyday is a little more
When all I hope is true
Is that you love me and I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
I always find you on my mind
To turn away like half the time
I didn't take you for the shy type
But if you want, I'll sneak you out tonight
And we will make this all alright
[Chorus]
'Cause it's so simple when I'm with you
'Cause I know you want me baby, and I know I want you too
'Cause it's so simple like the honest truth
It's like a timelapse baby, we could spend a day or two
And fall in love

[Verse 2]
It hits me when the moon lights up your face
Baby you could never be replaced
'Cause now you lit a spark
You've pulled my life right outta the dark
'Cause everybody's basking In your glow
But I was never in this for the show
Is this really true
Do you love me 'cause I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
I always find you on my mind
But you turn away like half the time
I didn't take you for the shy type
But if you want, I'll sneak you out tonight
And we will make this all alright

[Chorus]
'Cause it's so simple when I'm with you
'Cause I know you want me baby, and I know I want you too
'Cause it's so simple like the honest truth
It's like a timelapse baby, we could spend a day or two

And fall in love
And fall in love
Yea I'll be everything
Everything that you need me to
And fall in love
And fall in love
We can be anything
Anything we put our hearts into

[Bridge]
'Cause you do something to me
That makes it harder to breathe
And I just couldn't believe
That you had fallen for me
And I just want you to know
That I can't stand all this wasting
For us to be together
(Oh yeah, oh woah)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's so simple when I'm with you
'Cause I know you want me baby, and I know I want you too
'Cause it's so simple like the honest truth
It's like a timelapse baby, we could spend a day or two
[Post-Chorus]
And fall in love
And fall in love
Yea I'll be everything
Everything that you need me to
And fall in love
And fall in love
We can be anything
Anything we put our hearts into17Embed
