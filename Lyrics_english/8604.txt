Foxy Lady Lyrics[Intro: Robert Smith, Jimi Hendrix and Lol Tolhurst]
When you're ready
So do we... is it two verses and then [incomprehensible]?
No, Lol, no
This is a good intro!

[Verse 1: Michael Dempsey]
You know you are a cute little heartbreaker
You know your eyes swim, little lovemaker

[Chorus: Michael Dempsey]
I want to take you home
I won't do you no harm
You've got to be all mine, all mine
[Verse 2: Michael Dempsey]
I see you come down on the scene, foxy
You make me want to get up and scream, foxy

[Chorus: Michael Dempsey]
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting, tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Michael Dempsey]
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mineYou might also like1Embed
