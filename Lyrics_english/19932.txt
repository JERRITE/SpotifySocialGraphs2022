TranslationsEspañolDream of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's a bad dancer, he's the right answer
He's a shy singer most of the time
Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker, he's a slow kisser
A confessed sinner all of the time
When it's him and I

[Pre-Chorus]
And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always
[Chorus]
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you
All I do, since I met you, is dream of you
So could you stay with me, lay with me
Talking 'bout nothing?
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you

[Verse 2]
I was not living, I was just writing about it
With my head spinning
Days passing by most of the time, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always (Always)

[Chorus]
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you
All I do, since I met you, is dream of you
So could you stay with me, lay with me
Talking 'bout nothing? Yeah
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you

[Post-Chorus]
I dream of you
I dream of you
I dream of you
Yeah, only you
I dream of you
Yeah, only you
I dream of you, ooh

Please say you dream of me too
Can you please say you dream of me too
Woah, boy, boy

[Chorus]
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you (All I do, of you)
All I do, since I met you, is dream of you (Since I met you, babe, since I met you, babe)
So could you stay with me, lay with me
Talking 'bout nothing? Yeah (Oh)
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you (All I do, all I do, all I do, all I do, all I do, ah)

[Post-Chorus]
I dream of you (Oh, ah)
I dream of you (Ooh)
I dream of you
Yeah, only you (Only you)
I dream of you (I dream of you)
Yeah, only you (I dream)
I dream of you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you8Embed
