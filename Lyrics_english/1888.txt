Voicemail Lyrics[Intro: Khalid]
There's just
Something I've been meaning to say to you
Pick up your phone and hit me back, alright?
Peace

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When there's someone you like, not someone you love
Say you needed the time, and I don't wanna rush
Got a lot on your mind, and I'm not one to judge
No, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Are we playin' a game?
Am I down on my luck?
'Cause this shit's not the same
We don't even touch, should I stay in my lane?
I don't wanna bug you, mm-mm (Ah, ah, ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
So when you're layin' in your bed
Playin' my songs
Can we share the thoughts that you keep? (That you keep from me)
Oh, you're runnin' through my head
Leadin' me on
Honestly I wouldn't change a thing, mm

[Chorus: Khalid]
I won't be such a drag
You don't gotta worry 'bout that, mm-mm, mm
I'll give you your space if you need it
Say it to my face, if you mean it
You make me so mad (So mad), mad
Why you gotta do me like that? (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)
Don't leave me waitin' for no reason, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it to my face if you mean it (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)

[Post-Chorus: Khalid & Kiana Ledé]
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé]
Why when I pull your way, you start to let go?
I open up and you throw it out the window
I'd do anything for you to say
All we can do is try, but you're so in denial
Been workin' at this for a long, long time
It's feelin' stagnant, we don't even fuck
And I just stay in my lane 'cause I don't wanna bug you, mm, mm-mm, mm, mm-mm

So when you're layin' in your bed
Playin' my songs
Can we share the thoughts that you keep? (That you keep from me)
Oh, you're runnin' through my head
Leadin' me on
Honestly I wouldn't change a thing, mm (No, I wouldn't change a thing)

[Chorus: Khalid & Kiana Ledé]
I won't be such a drag (Ooh, nah)
You don't gotta worry 'bout that, mm-mm, mm (You don't have to worry anymore)
I'll give you your space if you need it
Say it to my face, if you mean it
You make me so mad, mad
Why you gotta do me like that? (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)
Don't leave me waitin' for no reason, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it to my face if you mean it

[Post-Chorus: Kiana Ledé & Khalid]
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me)
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me waitin')
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me)

[Outro: Khalid]
Girl, I'm open
[?]
You should see me at nightEmbed
