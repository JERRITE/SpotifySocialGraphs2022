Dawning of the Season Lyrics[Verse 1]
What'd she say about me?
Hands in pockets, so deep
When I walk I see you stare, white lockers dripping with despair
Pooling around my feet
Hold your breath and don't speak
Witnesses and zombies
And the way they glare as empty as an answering machine
No one here to hear your dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Nah, you don't bother me
I'm like electricity
[Chorus]
They say I'm dancing with my demons
This is the dawning of the season
Melancholy girls and nonbelievers
This is the dawning of the season

[Verse 2]
What you heard about me?
I see fire when I sleep
I can disappear like drops of water trembling in the heat
No, you wonâ€™t see me

[Pre-Chorus]
Nah, you don't bother me
I'm like electricity

[Chorus]
They say I'm dancing with my demons
This is the dawning of the season
Melancholy girls and nonbelievers
This is the dawning of the season

[Bridge]
Will we change? Will I be?
Adolescent dreams
Will we change? Will I be?
Adolescent thieves
You might also like[Chorus]
They say I'm dancing with my demons
This is the dawning of the season
Melancholy girls and nonbelievers
This is the dawning of the season
They say I'm dancing with my demons
This is the dawning of the season
Melancholy girls and nonbelievers
This is the dawning of the seasonEmbed
