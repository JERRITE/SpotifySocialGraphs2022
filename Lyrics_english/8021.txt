Scare Me Lyrics[Verse: KARRA]
They say you should stay away from villains
But I don't really see the fun in that
They told me you'll never learn your lesson
But they don't know I took a different class

[Pre-Chorus: KARRA]
He keeps me dancing on my toes
Leaves me hungry wantin' more
And I love the rush (Ah)
Always unpredictable
But there's one thing that I know
That our love is trash
[Chorus: KARRA]
I'm falling for the monster, he keeps me up at night
Now my days are numbered
Til' I lose my mind
I'm falling for a robber, stealin' all my time
I can smell the danger, the danger
But he don't scare me

[Post-Chorus: KARRA]
He don't scare me

[Verse: KARRA]
They say you should stay away from villains
But I don't really see the fun in that
They told me you'll never learn your lesson
But they don't know I took a different class

[Pre-Chorus: KARRA]
He keeps me dancing on my toes
Leaves me hungry wantin' more
And I love the rush (Ah)
Always unpredictable
But there's one thing that I know
That our love is trash

[Chorus: KARRA]
I'm falling for the monster, he keeps me up at night
Now my days are numbered
Til' I lose my mind
I'm falling for a robber, stealin' all my time
I can smell the danger, the danger
But he don't scare me
You might also like[Chorus: KARRA]
I'm falling for the monster, he keeps me up at night
Now my days are numbered
Til' I lose my mind
I'm falling for a robber, stealin' all my time
I can smell the danger, the danger
But he don't scare me1Embed
