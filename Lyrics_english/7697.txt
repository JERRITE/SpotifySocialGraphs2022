Walks Like Rihanna Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom Parker]
Have you seen that girl? Have you seen her?
She's the freakiest thing, you gotta meet her
You do whatever it takes to get her by your side
(Ooh, woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Max George]
It's not the way she smiles with a little laugh
It's not the way she looks in a photograph
But all the boys—they crowd around
[Chorus: All]
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna

[Verse 2: Jay McGuiness]
Have you seen that girl? Have you seen her?
With the way she moves, you wanna kiss her
She'll be the girl of your dreams if you can close your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Max George]
You can feel that beat when she's in the room
You can feel your heart going boom-boom
And all the boys—they crowd around

[Chorus: All]
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna

[Post-Chorus: All]
She walks like Rihanna
She walks like Rihanna

[Refrain: Nathan Sykes, Max George]
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna

[Chorus: All]
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance
But who cares? She walks like Rihanna

[Post-Chorus: All]
She walks like Rihanna
She walks like Rihanna

Our hearts go boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
Our hearts go boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
She walks like Rihanna
Our hearts go boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
Our hearts go boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
