When It Ends Lyrics[Intro: Drippin So Pretty]
It's been awhile since you called back
Say you love me, but I'm doing too bad
I hope I make you proud when it ends
Baby, I'm just tryna blend in

[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
It's been awhile since you called back
Say you love me, but I'm doing too bad
I hope I make you proud when it ends
Baby, I'm just tryna blend in
[Verse 1: Drippin So Pretty]
You fell in love with a demon, baby life ain't easy
Catch me in the whip, speeding with my wrist fucking bleeding
Baby, I'm uneasy, I'd better stop thinking
Before I load this .45 and say goodnight to my people
I swear I hate sleeping, I see all of my demons
Showing me my past that I'll never stop seeing
Now my ice got me bleeding, I'm finna change the season
Thought it was the summer, but I swear I am anemic

[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
It's been awhile since you called back
Say you love me, but I'm doing too bad
I hope I make you proud when it ends
Baby, I'm just tryna blend in
It's been awhile since you called back
Say you love me, but I'm doing too bad
I hope I make you proud when it ends
Baby, I'm just tryna blend in

[Verse 2: Brennan Savage]
It's been too long, since you hit my phone and told me you love me
And you told me you cared
If I died, would you cry?
Would you stop, would you stare?
Would you keep moving on?
Or would you think that it's fair?
Would you tell 'em I'm a bad guy?
That I deserved to go
But I'm an angel, yeah I tried to cope
But I was down bad, yeah I tied the rope
But you pushed me, did you think I would float?
Trying my best, need to keep my heart in my chest
You know I'm not like the rest, but you know I'm the best you've seen
And I'ma come clean, I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
I'ma do what I dream, and I need you with me
You might also like[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
It's been awhile since you called back
Say you love me, but I'm doing too bad
I hope I make you proud when it ends
Baby, I'm just tryna blend in2Embed
