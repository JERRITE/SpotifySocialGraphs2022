It Gets Easy Lyrics[Pre-chorus]
Well I don't know where I'm headed (no, I don't know)
I hope you make it there with me
I keep on living (I'm keeping on)
I hope one day you'll get to see
Just why I did it (I'll let you know)
It's not as simple as it seems
Oh no I feel it (I know I know)
I feel it deep inside of me
We could leave, we could take a trip
Can't run from the pain, can't escape this shit
I know
Gotta learn how to live with it
You can fight it all you want or you embrace that shit
[Chorus]
It get easy
When you're feeling low
It get easy
When you just don't know
It get easy
When you're feeling low
It get easy
When you just don't know

[Verse]
I know you ain't felt right in a minute (la la)
Like the life that you're living ain't living (la la)
Terrified that it might be the ending (la la)
Still running from your demons can't kill 'em (la la)
I know the pain might leave you with a open wound
Bleeding out on the ground hoping you heal soon
I know the light get dim when you're in that room
Left alone with your thoughts what are you gon' do?
Can't hide from yourself for the rest of your life (rest of your life)
Can't live no lie even though you try (though you try)
Only get one go around in this life (in this life)
Can't rush through it all you gotta take your time

[Pre-chorus]
Well I don't know where I'm headed (no, I don't know)
I hope you make it there with me
I keep on living (I'm keeping on)
I hope one day you'll get to see
Just why I did it (I'll let you know)
It's not as simple as it seems
Oh no I feel it (I know I know)
I feel it deep inside of me
We could leave, we could take a trip
Can't run from the pain, can't escape this shit
I know
Gotta learn how to live with it
You can fight it all you want or you embrace that shit
[Chorus]
It get easy
When you're feeling low
It get easy
When you just don't know
It get easy
When you're feeling low
It get easy
When you just don't knowEmbed
