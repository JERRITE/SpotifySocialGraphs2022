The Antidote Lyrics [Lyrics of "The Antidote"]

[Intro]
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou

[Verse 1: king jU]
Darkshit, one shot, thing that scratches the bumper
Each attack plays you, join stup
The kings of tchik-tchik, tchouk-tchouk music
You listen to the Crou when you do Crac Crac
Rascar Capac you snatch your tongue like a tic tac
Fuck the rock stars, welcome to my nightmare
No cashmere sweater, I am choking you like the eighty
Hardcore, poor tocards, I’m like a severe father
This thing must be persevered, fucking guy check these worms
No ukulele, no be-bop-a-lula
The rod in your mouth like a cracotte or a granola
My face of a gogol, freaks out the crowds too much but it adds me full of cagoles when I put on this hood!
[Chorus]
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou

[Verse 2: king jU]
The rabbit wants its stup-dose, ready to bite to the blood
He uses his pink truffle to go and scratch some sounds
And it takes off, always hopping over the overdose
How to eat stup without caught myxomatosis?
It wants hip-hop, psychotropic
Which causes blunders that burst
Guy I have the big big potato
Who saw the paws with Crou psychopaths
Haters do Ièch, are shady like HRD
Guy it's auch, you have to kindly
You're just a poor bell, I'm clash
Son returns to the niche, faced with the uggs, which is posthe
In the Crou no poodles, no potiches, no cheating
We are the crrou flip-flip, no Nikolic Filip
Psychedelic hardcore
Don't mandate me I get guy!
You might also like [refrain]
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou

[Verse 3: king jU]
It's not soup, I balancing bombs
I am in my stup-soucoupe, my zic is my valve
I deceive this cut-off thing
My Hardrock click Tell
Tile slaps and smoke your cigarettes
I'm hip hop cyclops who goes beep, beep
Stupeflip, super top it spreads the slop
It's panic in your was
No flop for my click
The sound of the Crou holds you on a leash
Make the oys that kick your buttocks
Are you getting there no caresses
Rascar k in your flakes corns
Crazy that to donff, it kills the teuf just a sound that fucks the slaps I'm King Ju with the bastard always ok to fuck your ends
It's heavy, it's gold what's in my hard drive
I make art discs, which will be golden discs!
[Chorus]
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou
If you feel out
If you got some strokes
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou
And if life gets you drunk and if you feel alone
You have to listen to the Stupeflip Crou, Crou5embed
