The Lyrics Question [Lyrics for "The Question"]

[Pre-car]
I approached him and I looked at her
I offered a drink and I told him
That if I was single or married
She told me "calm '" that nothing happened
I approached him and I looked at her
And between a couple of glasses, a crazy note
She told me "calm '" that nothing happened
[Verse 1]
For me it is a pleasure to meet you
Tell your name that something I want to propose
Relax, all I want is to talk
Know me first you won't regret
Let evil dominate us
And that desire makes me end with me
If you feel alone, he doesn't value you anymore
Scave with me and forget the hours, mom

[Chorus]
And today I will make you forget, the hair I will release you
I will make a story with your body that in your mind I will capture
And today I will make you forget, the hair I will release you
I will make a story with your body that in your mind I will capture

[Post-car]
I approached him and I looked at her
I offered a drink and I told him
That if I was single or married
She told me "calm '" that nothing happened
I approached him and I looked at her
And between a couple of glasses, a crazy note
She told me "calm '" that nothing happened

[Verse 2]
We are already in the Fest with the glasses
Heat, pressure, tension wraps us
Curiosity and intensity
They made you and I went to the beyond

And in seconds (Woro, Wo-Woh)
I will take over your world (Yeh, Yeh, EH)
I will show you the way (Na, Na, Na, Na)
I'm going to change your destiny

[Chorus]
And today I will make you forget, the hair I will release you
I will make a story with your body that in your mind I will capture
And today I will make you forget, the hair I will release you
I will make a story with your body that in your mind I will capture

[Post-car]

[Bridge]
And in seconds (Woro, Wo-Woh)
I will take over your world (Yeh, Yeh, EH)
I will show you the way (Na, Na, Na, Na)
I'm going to change your destiny
[Outro]
Hey, only one looks is needed, a couple of words
So that ours can happen
I know there are many little princesses that are going through this
Then people who take advantage of the situation come
And make it happen
