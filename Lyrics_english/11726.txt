Masseduction Lyrics[Intro: Toko Yasuda]
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗

[Verse 1: St. Vincent]
Black saint, sinner lady
Playin' knock-off soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor
Nuns in stress positions
Smokin' Marlboros
Lolita is weeping
"The bride is beautiful"
[Chorus: St. Vincent]
Mass seduction
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

[Verse 2: St. Vincent]
Smilin' nihilist met
Angry glass half full
Drinkin' Manic Panic
Singin' Boatman's Call
Teenage, Christian virgins
Holdin' out their tongues
Paranoid secretions
Fallin' on basement rugs
You might also like[Chorus: St. Vincent]
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

[Bridge: St. Vincent]
Oh, what a bore to be so adored
Oh, what a bore to be so adored

[Chorus: St. Vincent]
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
[Outro: St. Vincent]
