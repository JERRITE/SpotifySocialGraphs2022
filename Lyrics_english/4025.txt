Criminal Lyrics [Intro]
Flip-d on the beat
Panty droppaz league

[Verse 1: Skusta Clee]
How are you? Come in
Come on, 'don't be shy to come in
Sorry at my house, a bit dirty and intriguing
I wish I could clean, case you come, never reach
Do you have wine? I have no drink, 'I have not wages yet
'Don't be afraid, you will enter the other companion
You are with them dark and dangerous on the road
I will take care of them, they will not be ruined
Send them to the sofa and then you rotate your wine
You closed the door, something I do
'Don't leave the room, I'll just take it
I need to come back and you are still there
Because you're not the only person, later, I have a visitor too
Hands tall and no one will act wicked
If you do not want one of you to fall and one of you will fall
All of this is my plan first, don't you notice?
Get ready to die at my hand
Now you have nothing to lose (wah)
[Verse 2: Bullet-D]
We are here, 'where are they getting worse at night
Everything is ready
When I am the one who breaks nothing left, beside
Just have a high hand, it's mine
'Do not let go, be released
Give me all I told you
'Don't be begging, - you
A-a-a-no, are you one?
All right, you move a weird
I will never change my mind
Because later, next time
You will burn with a burning fire
Until your body smells
In the blood you swim and you are poor, boy
You died without knowing

[Verse 3: JNSKE]
It's up to me (â€”hala)
There is no more conscience to beg
I will do this in front of them even in the eyes of you
Cover the mouth, 'don't speak
If you don't enjoy it, you can't escape
Even if you are still begging
Even cry out loud, no one can hear outside
All with you, lying down that I have poured gas too
Just a little time, our show will end again
Clean plans that no one can detect Might Also LikeEmbed
