You don't know how to give love (sympathy) lyrics [verse 1]
I thought I was going well, and I was wrong
Today you are going without saying why
Where are you, where will you go
Tell me what I did wrong
I just know that I always loved you
And that this goodbye seems cruel to me

[Chorus]
You don't know how to give love, just cause pain
You gave me all love to take it off
You stole my heart, you looked for a reason
To break it, to take it
[Verse 2]
It hurts so much to accept me I fell in love
What do you leave soon and you don't say why
That ever, I know that
Next to me you will return
Now I understand well, I never cared
This goodbye is something so cruel

[Chorus]
You don't know how to give love, just cause pain
You gave me all love to take it off
You stole my heart, you looked for a reason
To break it, no!

You didn't care more
Nor does it hurt a little left behind
You don't know how to give love
You have no heart

That is why mine
Love you took it
Without an explanation

You stole my heart, you looked for a reason
To break it ...
