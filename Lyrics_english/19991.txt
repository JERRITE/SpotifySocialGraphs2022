I SAW A GHOST Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing in between a piece of mind
Tattered at the seams and fragile, I
Lie to tell the truth, but tell me why
Can't believe a dream can take your life

[Chorus]
What if I told you what meant the most to me?
What if I told you that I saw a ghost?
What if I told you that you got too close to me?
What if I told you that I'm not who you hope?
What if I told you what meant the most to me?
What if I told you that I saw a ghost?
What if I told you that you got too close to me?
What if I told you that I'm not who you hope?
[Bridge]
Standing in between a piece of mind
Tatted at the seams and fragile, I
Lie to tell the truth, but tell mе why
I can't believe a drеam can take your life

[Verse 2]
Was it just a piece of my imagination?
Did I fall asleep in our conversation?
I'm waiting for the answer to a question that I can't remember

[Chorus]
What if I told you what meant the most to me?
What if I told you that I saw a ghost?
What if I told you that you got too close to me?
What if I told you that I'm not who you hope?

[Post-Chorus]
Waiting for the answer to a question that I can't remember
Can't remember, can't remember, can't remember

[Outro]
Standing in between a piece of mind
Tatted at the seams and fragile, I
Lie to tell the truth, but tell me why
I can't believe a dream can take your life
Can't believe a dream can take your life
Can't believe a dream can take your lifeYou might also like2Embed
