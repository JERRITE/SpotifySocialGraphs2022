Blood Honey Lyrics[Refrain]
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down

[Chorus]
I've got you tied up, I love it
Tied up, I love it
Now, why would I set you free?
Now you're tied up, you love it
No lies, now, I love it
I'm not being mean, I'm just being me
[Verse]
I got some feelings
But I try to hide when I'm healing
I fuck every broken-crazy-girl
Instead of hanging from the ceiling

So, I keep my life a lie
I keep my head loose
My nose is like a beehive
I'm dripping blood honey
I'm drinking blood honey, yeah

[Chorus]
I've got you tied up, I love it
Tied up, I love it
Now, why would I set you free?
Now you're tied up, you love it
No lies, now, I love it
I'm not being mean, I'm just being me

[Refrain]
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down

I'm drinking blood honey
I'm dripping blood honey, yeah
I'm dripping blood honey
I'm drinking blood honey, yeah

[Refrain]
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down15Embed
