Restroom Occupied Lyrics[Intro]
OG Parker

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hundred shots, dollar bills
Drippin' on the sides, flex your necklace, quarter mil' (Yeah, yeah)
We are not in the same league, same lane, same place (Nah, nah)
We don't move at the same speed, can't be no race (Ooh, oh yeah)
You can keep smilin', you can keep starin' me down
I'ma take your bitch, watch me
You look around, she is nowhere to be found
In the bathroom with her, got my dick in her mouth, yeah (Woo)
She gettin' piped right now
Eyes rollin' in the back of her head, lookin' like lights out
She's mine right now
You should've never played with a real nigga
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now we makin' love in the restroom (Yeah, yeah, got your bitch)
I thought you knew that this is what I do
I thought I told you not to test my gangster
Pussy nigga wanna play games with me (No, no)
Now I got your main thing with me (No, no)
And she doing all kinds of shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
In the restroom making love
She give it up
Doin' all kind of tricks
Bustin' all kind of splits on my shit
She gon' bust it open for me
I'm gon' finish
That's the reason why sign says, "Occupied"

[Verse 2: Yella Beezy]
S-She gon' bust it, let me touch it
Sloppy fuckin', oh no (Hey)
Let me touch it, squeeze and rub it
Beat that pussy slow-mo
He can love you, I can't trust you
Know that is a no-no
Freaking, hunching, pussy popping
Clown that pussy, Bozo, hey
Makin' love in the restroom, hey
Say she my baby, no test tube, hey
Baby girl, know I wanna sex you
I don't like talkin', I'ma text you, hey
Make your next move be your best move
Goin' straight to voicemail, can't get through
Ba-baby girl, come, let me dress you
Stick my dick all in your neck, boo

[Verse 3: Yella Beezy & Chris Brown]
Ain't no typin' "hold on," I already stole her
Now she bent over, hah, and this bitch sober
She know what she doin'
So I dive in the deep end
Know who I am, the chief, and
Guess what she doin'? Cheatin'
Fuckin' her in my Timbs
Asking me how it feel
To be with a real nigga
She said my dick bigger, not sorry
Got a condom, we ain't worried 'bout Maury
Got a condo if she really wanna party
Booty fire, but we really got a problem
And I'm 'bout to fuck her, the way she walkin'
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now we makin' love in the restroom (Yeah, yeah, got your bitch)
I  thought you knew that this is what I do
I thought I told you not to test my gangster
Pussy nigga wanna play games with me (No, no)

Doin' all kind of tricks
Bustin' all kind of splits on my shit
She gon' bust it open for me
