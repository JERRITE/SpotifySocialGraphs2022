We eat alive Lyrics [letter of "we eat alive"]

[Intro: Chencho Corleone & Maluma]
You know that you were born for me
Yes-si-sii-if I kiss her
RUDEBOYZ
Maluma, baby (says)
Wuh

[Pre-car: Chencho Corleone & Maluma, Maluma]
He says he doesn't love me, now he hates me
But I call her and answer me
He still does with me (oh-oh; i love you, baby)
He says no and still hurts if I ignore her
That vo'a take another to my bed
We end up being an enemy '(tell me, Chencho)
[Chorus: Chencho Corleone & Maluma]
I have not found a way to deny him a kiss (no, no, no)
We hate each other until I love ', who understand that?, Oh-oh (Yeah, Yeah, andеah)
Almost always argued 'without any reason
When we come to realize we are 'eating alive' (Rra, Yah; Wuh!)

[Verse 1: Maluma]
We stayed that last time (understand) was the last time (understand)
And there are already twenty -five in the last month (hahahaha)
This is never to stop and give him replay (rrr; me)
It has more season 'than "the paper house" (hahaha; sha)
After a drinki, Nasty (mmm) is put
I am the Dirty and she my lassie (wuh)
Güeri gets although it is not Sissy
And as Messi, putting it very easy (e 'like this; wuh!)
In the search I lost, that's why I went back to you
The same, what happened, mommy? Do you want to try more from me? (Yah)
The day I met you, that day I put you
We made a pact without rupture that will have no end (says)

[Chorus: Chencho Corleone & Maluma]
I have not found a way to deny him a kiss (no, no, no; Wuh!)
We hate each other until I love ', who understands that?, Oh-oh (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Almost always argued 'without any reason
When we come to realize we are 'eating alive'

And he wants to wake up
And have me by his side as the officer (ah)
When he feels that he has me he gets fighting
Says things that put me to machine (ah)
That I don't even want to call her
Although sometimes he feels good, sometimes he feels bad
But whenever I look for her, she usually rides
Says that the last sees', that you want to get away
But it is contradicted, before leaving more (Yeah, Yeah)

[Pre-Caro: Maluma & Chencho Corleone]
He says he does not love me, now he has hate (you know ')
But I call her and answer me
He still does with me (me, me, me)
He says no and still hurts if I ignore her
That vo'a take another to my bed
We end up being an enemy '

[Chorus: Chencho Corleone & Maluma]
I have not found a way to deny him a kiss (no, no, no)
We hate each other until I love ', who understands that?, Oh-oh (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
