100 Strangers Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got to get out son
You got your back against the wall
And the end has just begun

And this place, there's a hundred strangers and I hardly know one face
And I sold my soul to the night
I'm a waste of time yet I've got to try

[Hook]
We're all worrying, about the same things
The end cannot begin at the start
We're all worrying, about the same things
The end cannot begin at the start
[Verse 2]
Spit your words out son, they cling to your lips like they're trying to hold on
And I like to tread the boards of avenues with open eyes

But I'm fine, my head isn't there
And I'm losing out but I'm trying not to care

[Hook]
We're all worrying, about the same things
The end cannot begin at the start
We're all worrying, about the same things
The end cannot begin at the startYou might also likeEmbed
