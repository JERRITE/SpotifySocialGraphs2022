My girl lyrics [my girl's letter "]

[Pre-car: Myke Towers & Wisin]
He has the 'back crazy' (crazy ')
And to the 'undecided' (undecided ') women
And I don't blame it, anyone is going to fall with their smile (W)
Only with a kiss she hypnotized me (hypnotized; oh-oh)
I can't forget what happened (no doubt)

[Chorus: Myke Towers & Wisin]
That e 'my girl, anyone fond
Far 'me winks me, Varia' they have a fight
Just because she is my girl, anyone foils (OH-OH-OH-OH)
From Daries I wink, several have a fight
[Verse 1: Myke Towers & Wisin]
He wants me to sing in Viña, he says that I can go (ah)
My love, you have me 'running along the line (ah)
And my head welcoming 'relieves' (Myke Towers)
It makes me 'being in La Paz, as in Bolivia
I want to travel the world with you (tra)
No woman understood me (tra)
And close the eye 'and tell me what place and what would be
I'm going to ask for a stay
I want to travel the world with you (you know 'now)
No woman understood me
And close the eye 'and tell me what place what would be (Ajá)
I'm going to ask you for a stay
They take something 'because she is with me
The one who lacks respect becomes my enemy
There is a lot of 'envious', they say that it is forbidden
He is always in my mind, I never forget her

[Chorus: Wisin & Myke Towers]
Because she is my girl, anyone fond (OH-OH-OH-OH)
From Daries I wink, several have a fight
Just because e 'my girl and anyone fond
And from far away 'I wink, they have a fight (Mister W)

[Verse 2: wisin]
Soft, mommy, give it there (tra), take it like this (tra)
I arrived at the party, it was for you (Yeah)
We are going to Switche with the lights turns off '(hard, hard, hard)
And how is he dancing with me well delivery '
My mom is fire (fire), fire (fire), fire
She gives me the signal and I hit (Yeah)
I'm still blind, mommy, I laughed (what?)
He likes to turn it on listening to Tego's album (passing her Chillin ')
