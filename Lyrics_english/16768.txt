If I Hadnâ€™t Got You LyricsIf I hadn't got you
If I hadn't got you

Whose friend would I be
If I lied all the time
If you never trusted my word
The love that we make
When feelings run high
Is all that makes sense in the world
And I can never go back, oh no
For a moment of sweet solitude
If I ever go back
I'd be looking for you
If I hadn't got you
Whose friend wouId I be
If I hadn't got you
I would die in solitary
If I hadn't got you
God only knows what I'd do
God only knows

Who's friend would I be if
I can't take a joke
If I can't pull a smile from a tear
The love that I feel
Whenever you're close
Makes yesterday's hurt disappear
And I can never go back, oh no
For a moment of sweet solitude
With my head in my hands
I've been waiting for you

If I hadn't got you
Whose friend would I be
If I hadn't got you
I would die in solitary
If I hadn't got you
Whose air would I breathe
If I hadn't got you
God only knows what I'd do
God only knows
You might also likeSo don't turn away
Never go back
Hold onto love
Cos love is all we have
Maybe you'll be lost in this world
Without me

If I hadn't got you
Whose friend would I be
If I hadn't got you
I would die in misery
If I hadn't got you
Whose air would I breathe
If I hadn't got you, yeah

If I hadn't got you
God only knows what I'd do
God only knowsEmbed
