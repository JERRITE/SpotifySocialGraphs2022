Corner of the World Lyrics[Intro]
I always fall

[Verse 1]
At school, no one knows him, he doesn't have an identity
Alone eating lunch, minute feels like infinity
But if they see him cry, that shit would be worse than anything
So he starts fights and hides it with masculinity
Dad is such a hard-ass, and mom is not around
It was tough when he was younger but he finally got it down
Convincing everybody he's a comic, he's a clown
'Cause he hides it so well that it can't possibly be found
He's constantly let down, but he says that he heals
He laughs and jokes about it, but it isn't real
He just mirrors the emotions that he wish he could feel
But if no one ever noticed, it's a victory, still
'Til the intensity builds and he can't sensibly deal
With never-ending emptiness, so he pretends to be filled
With a type of happiness that simply doesn't exist
And when they notice all them cold shoulders crush him again
Then it's
[Chorus]
Back to the corner of the world
Where the sun don't shine
This place is too familiar
No matter how far I go, I always fall
Back to the corner of the world
Where the sun don't shine
This place is too familiar
No matter how far I go, I always fall

[Verse 2]
Today he considered giving up again
Walked to the freeway, thought about jumping in
'Cause lately, he been suffering
Wish he had the guts to win
Wish that he was made with some tougher skin
But it sucks to feel, so he just tucks it in
Been poppin' those again 'cause it helps him pretend
Even though the same things overdosed his friends
At least he got the plug: twenty bucks for ten
Stupid prices for some droopy high kid
Smiling about his life as if he truly likes it
Brightens everybody's day but truly in a crisis
For Christ's sakes, no one ever asks how his life is

[Bridge]
Everyone around him think he got it all
When it's a party, everybody wanna get involved
Then he wake up in the morning and it all dissolved
That's when he always falls, that's when he always falls
You might also like[Chorus]
Back to the corner of the world
Where the sun don't shine
This place is too familiar
No matter how far I go, I always fall
Back to the corner of the world
Where the sun don't shine (I always fall)
This place is too familiar
No matter how far I go, I always

[Outro]
I always fall
I always fallEmbed
