Don't be afraid of him Lyrics [Letter of "Do not fear him" ft. Héctor & Tito]

[Intro: Periquito & Héctor "El Father"]
I spend whole nights thinking about your love (love)
I wish you are not with him (with him)
Well, you know that he cheats you
It harms you, and you end up fearing him (fearing him)
He doesn't deserve to have you, my love (my love)
I live dreaming that you are not with him (with him)
Well, you know that he cheats you
It harms you, and you end up fearing him (fearing him)
(Héctor and Tito; Trébol clan; luny tunes; what and what)
(For You, My Lova, for you in love ')
[Chorus: Tito "El Bambino"]
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will delete your name
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will delete your name

[Verse 1: Berto "El Original"]
Forget your name and face
His heat, his bed, and his pillow
His words are worth anything
Why tears do you spill '?

[Bridge: Tito "El Bambino"]
Why do you cry, love?
Why do you fear? Tell me
Why are you still tied from that man
What only gives you sadness and pain?
Why do you cry, love?
Why do you fear? Tell me
Why are you still tied from that man
What only gives you sadness and pain?

While I stay here for you waiting
In the same place, on the same balcony
Where I give you my heart for you
Forget it that you are not your owner
It is not your owner, it is not your owner
It is not your owner, forget it that it is not your owner

[Chorus: Tito "El Bambino"]
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will delete your name
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will delete your name

[Verse 3: Héctor "El Father" & Periquito]
Do not let your habit surround you (give me your love)
And you will see that he is from a man (come next to me)
My heart is hungry (what am I going to do?)
And then forget your name

[Pre-Caro: Berto "El Original"]
Don't be afraid of him, don't fear him (no)
That he does not owe your skin (no)
And I will always be by your side, sheltering you
Don't be afraid of him, don't fear him (no)
That he does not owe your skin (no)
And I will always be by your side, sheltering you
[Chorus: Tito "El Bambino"]
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will delete your name
I just want you to forget your name
He deceives you, and that's not a man
When I leave you alone, I do not astonish you '
Come with me, and you will erase your nameembed
