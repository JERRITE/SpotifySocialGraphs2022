The Lyricsweaaaaa gold chain ...... (Look at the gold chain!) 
 I know you before you sell your eyes 
 For a gold chain 
 For an elegant life 
 You have covered your beauty with a coat 
 A bitter coat and fine manners 
 And your new owner .... does not let you dance 
 And the party is starting ... and he starts crying! 
 Chorus: 
 Mami the gold chain looks that is not worth na ' 
 I offer you the moon reflected in the sea 
 And the wind that caresses you with the taste of my cumbia 
 Drill mommy!, Let it fall mommy, let it fall ... even if that shines is not worth (2x) 
 Instrumental 
 And where is the joy, and where is the tenderness 
 To decorate your figure, you lost what you had 
 Now it's just a lie all your life 
 Love is free you can't buy your void with money ... you can't fill it out 
 Choir (4x) 
 Drop ... (there is your life easy) 
 Let it fall.... 
 That although that shines is not worth (2x) 
 Well you know that not everything that shines is gold! from Colombia Papa'you miGht Also Likeembed
