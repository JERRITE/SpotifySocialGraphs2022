Damn spring lyrics ["Damn spring" letter]]

[Verse 1]
It was more or less like that
White wine, night and old songs
And I laughed at my sweet liar, the damn spring
That remains of an erotic dream, yes
Suddenly I wake up and have gone
I feel the emptiness of you
Despair me as if love hurt
And even if I don't want to, unintentionally I think of you
[Chorus]
Yes, to fall in love now
The damn spring will return to me
I dream of you, yes, to fall in love with enough an hour
The damn spring passes light
It happens light, it hurts me only to me

[Verse 2]
What your passage left
It's a kiss that doesn't pass from a kiss
A caress that does not sound sincere
I love you and I don't love you
And even if you don't want without wanting to think 'in me

[Chorus]
Yes, to fall in love now
The damn spring will return to me
I dream of you, yes, to fall in love with enough an hour
The damn spring passes light
It is light, I curses me only to me

[Verse 3]
Let me love you as if love lived
And even if you don't want, unintentionally think of me
What does it matter if to fall in love with an hour just
The damn spring passes light
It passes light to you and meyou might Also likembed
