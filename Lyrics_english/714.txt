TranslationEnglishdesnudDe Lyrics [letter of "undress"]

[Intro: Brytiago]
At home they ask for you, I 'say that I lost you
Everything was my fault, I feel so why
Get out of me, take me up in face that is already happy

[Pre-Caro: Brytiago & Jay Wheeler]
To your little friend I saw, the one that spoke badly about me
I told her that bad mine, that she was right
Now she mocks me
Getting in face that I am unhappy '
[Choir: Jay Wheeler & Brytiago]
And for my mother that I want to forget you, yes
But they are more 'the' wins' to undress you here, Baby
This shit has been a process
Give me a break that I'm already in that
Although I prefer to get up with one of your kiss' (kiss)
And for my mother that I already want to forget you, yes
But they are more 'the' wins' to undress you here, Baby
This shit has been a process
Give me a break that I'm already in that
Although I prefer to get up with one of your kiss'

[Verse 1: Jay Wheeler]
Vi-vi-taking your stories on Instagram
When Jangueo forgot you
But I come back and I remember you when the days leave
Already your photos in my mirror are not
I don't want to feel alone
But I think every time that enroll
And I shit in your memory
If I see you with another I bite
Take me up face that I deserve to cry
That before 'it hurt, but you don't care
You became a daughter 'e whore
And I know that everything was because of me
It's a process to forget your kiss'

This must be hell
Already your mai 'does not say that I am the son -in -law
In the mind I imagine to the pose '
And I feel like noviecito 'and twelve

Baby, returns pa'cá, that I want a refill
Instantly, you left after 'that you got used to you
I was the first to celó, now strange to his hair
If I lost it, it was no matter how jealous, if you see it, 'can say it
