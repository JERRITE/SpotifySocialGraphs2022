Hazy Shade of Winter Lyrics[Intro]
Time, time, time
See what's become of me

[Verse 1]
Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please

[Chorus]
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
[Verse 2]
Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

[Chorus]
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Verse 3]
"Hang on to your hopes, my friend"
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again

[Chorus]
Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

[Bridge]
Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground6Embed
