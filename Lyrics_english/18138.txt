Princess Lyrics [Words of "Princess" ft. Nemir]

[Verse 1: nekfeu]
Little freshness, you are mannequin
But you are far from being a model girl
You like to shoot your shootings
Because you enjoy a modern life
You spend your time scrolling
Your opponents, defy them
I like your tapered tights
Do not compare yourself to ugly girls
Even at school, you're popular as you are
You count more the compliments harvested
And, in your evenings, there are people on the balcony
But I'm not talking about your neckline
I am a guy aside, we don't come from the same dimension
I try to lead my boat and, you tell me about immense yachts
I rub shoulders with girls and then elderly girls
But even in love, I see few challenges
So many vultures, the lifespan is bought
Everyone around seems to stare at me
You make galas in your home
Because you think wealth makes the world dream
I came because I received your invitation
But I feel uncomfortable in these events
[Refrain: Nemir]
Princess
Spend your time in the evening, to sleep during the day
Princess
Beware of thugs that turn you around
Your curves leave me speechless
I like to see you in heels, in light outfit
You have nothing of an example, and before you
How many are burned the wings?
Princess
Go back down to earth, tell me what you play

[Verse 2: nekfeu]
You drink rum, you play roles
Obeyed shady diagrams
Your father likes to criticize the Roma
But your dresses come from Manoush
And it's funny like Isabelle
Some of your friends tell you unfriendly
You go from shop to anti -sik Batik store
But you are just a child who disguises his pain
Your angelic face changes when you mix liqueurs
It's strange but your sire thinks more of his hubcaps (than you)
Your mom swallows every time you get you upset
You abused it again yesterday
We pardon you for your beautiful eyes (han)
We are exported, in sex, we speak
I'm the first ex-gauge to take you to see exhibitions
You might also like [Refrain: Nemir]
Princess
Spend your time in the evening, to sleep during the day
Princess
Beware of thugs that turn you around
Your curves leave me speechless
I like to see you in heels, in light outfit
You have nothing of an example, and before you
How many are burned the wings?
Princess
Go back down to earth, tell me what you play

[Verse 3: nekfeu]
Charming princes escape the waves
You, you build sand castles
To be open to the world
You don't need to be convertible
As if you liked you that you have trouble, you didn't stop them anymore
A little princess should not become the queen of the whores
An angel passes, the wings deployed
Time of floating
Remember how strong you thought it was
Before the first man lies you
You opened your wrists because of another abortion
Your marks can testify to this
You are like a kid, the words you miss
You make no effort, you want to crack more
Every charmed man
By your character will be content to look
Your heart is a safe, you must have arranged
Hide behind a mask
And spend your time spraying
You are more the same than before
Ié-ié-ié
