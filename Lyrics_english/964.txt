Lyrics memories ["Memories" letter]

[Intro: luar the l]
Alone in bed you and me, baby

[Pre-organ: luar la l, Channel]
I still have memories (memory '), I see them and make you want to do it
When I pulled you for the hair, I remember ', I remember (I remember)
Baby, I just want to put it on you, TBT, I remember the day 'The Hall
I put my hand inside the mahón and you agreed (okay)
If you liked us as we did, on your part it is that we repeated
Pеro now I joined, here with your 'recovery'
When I touched you and you arrived
Look well the 'photo', you also saved
[Chorus: Channel & Luar la L]
I don't want to remember you, I want to see you (see you)
Above me, as you liked (liked)
In your puddle it was me the one who rowed
But you wanted to lose yourself (lose yourself)
I deal with another and your memory lies (I lift me)
If I fall to another it gives me the bad
I don't want to remember you, I want to see you (see you, huh)
Above me, as you liked (ah)
In your puddle it was me the one who rowed
But you wanted to lose yourself (lose, huh)
I deal with another and your memory lies (ah)
If I fall to another, it gives me the bad one, ma '

And I who touched me with the videos and to'a the photos (you know ')
This dust is over and the other
I want to repeat, I am a fan of that toto
I have given you with a condon and alpella
I have a tbt, it was in the school bathroom
Giving you hard listening to ark and the
He made me a couple of poses, the Shorty Modela

And I wonder when I will see her straight
Pa 'give him again, and it is that in four the frequent feed
I want to give you in the back of the Acura
Shorty you are hard, perfect structure
I don't know why I think about you at this point
