It Was Always There Lyrics[VERSE]
I’m finally seeing
What’s in front of my eyes
Couldn’t live here forever
Inside a disguise

This house has got stories
That it won’t ever tell
Burned down like a fire
The last drop in the well
[Chorus]
I am fading far away from all I’ve ever known
I’m just wondering how I never saw it coming Through my door
‘Cause it was always there
Always there
Yeah It was always there
Always there

[VERSE]
My mother’s an outlaw
The best there ever was
I learned all that I needed
Within these four walls

I got gold in a package
Mailman hands me the goods
Just one taste and I’ve lost it
Like she knew that I would


[Chorus]
I am fading far away from all I’ve ever known
I’m just wondering how I never saw it coming Through my door
‘Cause it was always there
Always there
Yeah It was always there
Always thereYou might also likeEmbed
