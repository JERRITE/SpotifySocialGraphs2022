Graveyard Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a little house on the outskirts of town
Tilted in a vow of dissonance
You better walk behind me, walk behind me again
How many times have we burnt it all down?
Plumes of smoke, call it graveyard love
Walk behind me, walk these hallways again

[Chorus]
The greatest illusion in the X-ray wind
Will take in my ruin, I keep clear of the windows
And I can't return, return to you
It's just the fear
Is this just the fear of not knowin' if you're there?
If you're therе
[Verse 2]
I could never fathom how to wake you up
Crushеd by the weight of your crucible
You better walk behind me, walk behind
And on the day that you wiped it all clean
Lost in a whisper did you say
"I'll never walk behind you, walk behind you again"

[Chorus]
The greatest illusion in the X-ray wind
Will take in my ruin, I keep clear of the windows
And I can't return, return to you
It's just the fear
Is this just the fear of not knowin' that you're there?
That you're there

[Outro]
I don't want to remember why
I don't want to remember why
I don't want to remember
I don't want to remember whyYou might also like1Embed
