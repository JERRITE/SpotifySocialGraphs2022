How I Get Myself Killed Lyrics[Intro]
This is probably how I get myself killed
This is probably how I get myself killed

[Chorus]
This is probably how I get myself killed
This is probably how I get myself killed

[Verse 1]
Did you say anything on the night of my first hit
On the night of my first kiss
On the night of my first runaway
Something must be up, I have never felt so dumb
And I have never gone so numb
And I have never been so late before
[Chorus]
This is probably how I get myself killed
This is probably how I get myself killed

[Verse 2]
Ah, come when you're called
If this is all we've got to work with then it's all we've got to blame
Ah, come when you're called
If this is all we've got to work with then it's all we've got to say
I'm lovin' your skin darlin', I'm lovin' this hard morning
I need to be kicked, maybe fucked, maybe told I'm in the way
I'm lovin' your skin darlin', I'm lovin' this kooky morning
I need to be kicked, maybe fucked, maybe told I'm in the way

[Break]
