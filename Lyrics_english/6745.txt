TranslationsFran√ßaisRed Pills (Love in the Matrix) Lyrics[Intro: Cooliecut]
Can't find, can't find
Love in the matrix at any time
Can't find, can't find
Love in the matrix at any time
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry

[Verse 1: Kin$oul]
What it do, nigga, this is Kin
The nigga that be rappin' from within
Members Only was a lil' clique
But now look, nigga, we a clan
Tryna get these bands, get these bands
It feel good when you spend it with your fam
Hatin' on a nigga make you lame
You think that's gonna help you to your fame?
I guess these females really love my voice
You wanna love me, shorty, that's your choice
I see you wear your heart up on your sleeves
While you rock them new designer jeans
I hope you know nothing out here free
Gotta pay attention for a fee
You sit here, listen, and turn to a geek
Get right with your money, go chase you some cheese
[Bridge: Kin$oul]
Fuck this matrix (Fuck this matrix)
Life's a simulation (A simulation)
Better know how to play it (How to play it)
Better know how to play it (How to play it)

[Verse 2: Cooliecut]
Okay, like, ain't got no heart, no patience, mmh
Can't find love, I'm in the Matrix, huh
Tryna put me in the system on a daily, mmh
Fuck the cops and they fuckin' baby, uh
Just tryna get a check, baby
But all these niggas actin' fuckin' shady, uh
Shadows all around me (Okay)
Shadows all around me, okay
Like what up, bitch, shut up, I'm stuck up, mmh
Fuck that lil' bitch and she nut up, mmh
After all that then she suck up, mmh (Okay)
Suck up, burp up, burp up, baby
Then I go home and go get me some sleep
I am so tired from playin' the sheep
I'm so tired from playin' the sheep
Then I go home and go get me some sleep

[Outro: Cooliecut]
Can't find, can't find
Love in the matrix at any time
Can't find, can't find
Love in the matrix at any timeYou might also like8Embed
