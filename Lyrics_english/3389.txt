Translationsenglishgashi - Creep on Me Feat. French Montana & Dj Snake (Turkish Translation) lyrics [Verse 1: Gashi]
When you are, my heart will come out (when I see you)
All these girls are sword because you are so beautiful (you are so sweet)
You are not the one I want, you are the one I need (Woah)
You tell your friends that you aren't really in love with me

[Pre -Nakarat: Gashi]
You can bring yourself to the forefront but that
I know you like it, why are you acting like that?
You can bring yourself to the forefront but that
I know you like it (you love that), why are you acting like that? (You like this)
[Nakarat: Gashi]
Because when you are alone, you are sneaky (when you were alone)
And you act like you won't fall in love
You call me every night
You always ask if there is no one at home (yes)
You sound like summer time
You cause the enlightenment of my life
I feel good while you are
You sound like summer time
You cause my life to be enlightened
I feel good with you (yes)

[Post -Nakarat: DJ Snake]
You said, "Take care of me when I'm with me,"
You said, "Take care of me when I'm with me,"

[Verse 2: Gashi]
I never thought that our love would come down so deep
And if this is not love, then I don't really know what it means
This is something we always dreamed of
You didn't hold yourself, you were not ashamed, you uploaded everything on me
You can continue to throw it, but I know, you like it
Why are you acting like that?
You can continue to throw it, but I know, you like it
Why are you acting like that?

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Ayy, ayy
My darling is sneaky
And oh I know, and I know
My darling is sneaky in me, oh I know
In the morning and in the evening, it is put next to me
It is inserted by me at night (Bi 'Weird!)
It is full of crazy in those mornings and evenings
At night full of crazy
Money cannot buy you love, but I know where to find you, my love
Aspen, not Poconos, no man's toes are not open
You talk about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
You talk about the return to Southern Greece, Southern Coast, Maldives, New York and Los Angeles
[Nakarat: Gashi]
Because when you are alone, you are sneaky (when you were alone)
And you act like you won't fall in love
You call me every night
You always ask if there is no one at home (yes)
You sound like summer time

I feel good with you
You sound like summer time
You cause my life to be enlightened
I feel good with you (yes)

[Last: Gashi]
You can continue from the front but I know, well (yes, yes)
You can continue ahead but I know, well, you like it
You love me, baby, you love me, yes yes
Well, oh, oh, well
