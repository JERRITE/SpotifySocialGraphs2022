Pretty girl (your song) Lyricsjohann Vera - Pretty Girl (your song) Lyrics

[Intro:]
No matter where are you
For the world baby where you go
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

[Verse 1:]
I finally see how much I loved you, Yei
I miss your face so much, I don't know why, no
I would like to tell you so many things, I can't, no
When you will call, not wait, I want to see you
[Pre-car:]
When they talk about you
I think of the love I gave you
It hurt when I lost you
The second I regretted

[Chorus:]
No matter where are you
For the world baby where you go
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

And I keep thinking
I had never released you
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

[Post-Coro:]
Forever, although without having you
You're always going to be my pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girl
Forever, although without having you
You're always going to be my pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girl

[Verse 2:]
So many memories that have left in my head, Yei
Your voice has been recorded, the words repeat, no
And even if you are with the
I know very well that you think, Yei
I start thinking, if you are going back to me
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro:]
When they talk about you
I think of the love I gave you
It hurt when I lost you
The second I regretted

[Chorus:]
No matter where are you
For the world baby where you go
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

And I keep thinking
I had never released you
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

[Post-Coro:]
Forever, although without having you
You're always going to be my pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girl
Forever, although without having you
You're always going to be my pretty, Pretty, Pretty Girl

[Bridge:]
Like you, my pretty girl
There is no one like you my pretty girl
See here my pretty, girl
Say yes, say that my pretty girl
And if you have someone
Who loves you the same
Don't release it
Another will not find

[Chorus:]
No matter where are you
For the world baby where you go
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

And I keep thinking
I had never released you
If you hear me on the radio
This is your song

[Outro:]
No matter where you are
For the world where you go
If you hear me on the radio
This is your field
