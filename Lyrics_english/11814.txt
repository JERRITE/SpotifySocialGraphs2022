Coffee eyes lyrics ["brown eyes" ft. Markinho]

[Intro]
My desire is
Kiss your mouth like that morning
And make love to you so much desire
Lose in your eyes coffee and never return
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace

[Chorus]
Kiss your mouth like that morning
And make love to you so much desire
Lose in your eyes coffee and not return
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace
[Verse: l'Omy]
If I had to talk about you
I would say you are pretty and a little more
I don't know what you left and I
Improvising even in my dreams to see you
I drink from you I want to fall in love
And that you can fall in love with
I know that I am now like bart
But for you I become Flanders

[Chorus]
Kiss your mouth like that morning
And make love to you so much desire
Lose in your eyes coffee and not return
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace

[Chorus: l'Omy]
Kiss your mouth (as you like, how I like me)
With so much desire (this is l'Omy ma, hey noblemusic)
Lose in your eyes coffee
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace

[Verse: Markinho]
And you are the Number One, and you, that you have me like this
And you, you are like that, if you, approach a little more
And you, did not let me think, and you, hey that I put so bad
And you, these nervous will be that they leave you

Kiss your mouth like that morning
And make love to you so much desire
Lose in your eyes coffee and not return
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace

[Outro]
This is the l'Omy baby
You know that I am not like that
I am worse
I'm with the tsunami
Pipe Flowers
Kiss your mouth
(Hey I love you)
With so much desire
Lose in your brown eyes
Get there to live there
Be able to die in peace1embed
