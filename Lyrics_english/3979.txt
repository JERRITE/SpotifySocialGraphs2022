[Intro: J Balvin]
Uah, UH-UH
Uah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (UH-UH)

[Pre-car: J Balvin]
Now he wants to return (now you want to return, Yeah)
Why, tell me what (for what, for what)
I no longer pay attention (none)
I have long put an end point (yes)
[Chorus: J Balvin]
What do you want by calling me at this time? (Yeah, time)
I know that attitude already (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah)
You know what to do very well to wrap me (wrapping me)
But this time is already too late (Uah, OH-OH-OH)

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
These are not hours of calling (no)
To the men 'that I love' breastfeed
Who wants 'to turn, want' burn (uh-juh)
Speaking of course and I fall 'until bad (ha)
For you I got a pill 'and left over Flow Lamar (woh)
But you don't ere 'a kardashian (no)
With you do not throw me, because if I do not retro they are embacacious
From Snapchat I would delete you, from Facebook I would delete you
From Instagram I would delete you, from my life I would delete you (Plo!)

[Pre-car: Bad Bunny]
And now he wants to return (Nah!)
Nah, what he wants 'e' fuck (wuh!)
But it is not going to be able (Fuck you)
I am going to see with another and I will bite you (uh)
And now he wants to return
Nah, what wants 'e' fuck
But he is not going to be able
I am going to see with another and you are going to bite (Nah!)

[Verse 2: J Balvin]
You try to do everything for me to come back
Things are not the same, why insist?
Avoid discomfort and your time do not lose

Hidden live checking the photos
Investigating my profile
Don't deny it, I know you

He wants to repeat it
Look for more
And that does not matter
Everything you did with me
He wants to repeat it
Look for more
And that does not matter
