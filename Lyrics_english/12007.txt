Hardly Ever Home Lyrics[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Whip game is nothing, step in plains, I'm stunting
Rolli on my wrist, cause my kick game disgusting
Always with a chick that like to give brain in public
All about my chips, I ain't with your discussion
Catch me on the road, with my get change production
Weed in my lungs, roll a big j and puff it
Legend in the game, I'm like Big, Jay and Puffy
Doing big things, but I got bigger things coming
Gotta have patience though, you don't get things by rushing
Pocket full of doe, on a big plain to Russia
Young Khalifa, show me any big name, I'll crush it
Got it on a plane, plus we get things through customs
Riding in my ride, let the top down, she love it
Money on my mind, on my mind nothing but ducats
MVP, put me in with the buckets
TGOD, nothing above it, Gang
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I ain't gotta say "I'm back", homie
Don't gotta write it for you to know it's a rap, homie
Them niggas perform, my niggas down to clap, homie
All I got is real friends, no rap homies
No latch on me, broke the mold
No match for me, I'm in my prime, most these cats 40
That ain't no disrespect, shout out them niggas that
Paved the way for us to get rich off the internet
And I put on, so all my niggas can benefit
And got problems for anybody who interject
Catch them off guard with my intellect
Get her home, get her wet, give me dome, give me neck
And I'm the hardest thing to clone
She don't answer when you call, we was probably getting stoned
And she hardly hit my phone
Always creeping with your girl, that's why she hardly ever home
