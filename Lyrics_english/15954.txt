I am a Lyrics disaster [letters of "I am a disaster"]

[Verse 1]
Only a few days have passed
Everything has changed with your departure
There are dirty dishes in the kitchen
And a sad dog that does not forget you

[Pre-car]
Today I realize that you need
And I wonder, what would happen
Yes, suddenly, you will leave
Forever from my life?
[Chorus]
I am a disaster when you leave home
In the closet I no longer meet the ties
I am a disaster, and I do not understand what happens
I'm already tired of canned foods

I am a disaster, and without you I am lost
Your vacation spoils my senses
I am a disaster and I feel confused
I want to tell you that enough of whims

[Post-car]
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you

[Pre-car]
Today I realize that you need
And I wonder, what would happen
Yes, suddenly, you will leave
Forever from my life?

[Chorus]
I am a disaster when you leave home
In the closet I no longer meet the ties
I am a disaster, and I do not understand what happens
I'm already tired of canned foods
You might also like a disaster, and without you I am lost
Your vacation spoils my senses
I am a disaster and I feel confused
I want to tell you that enough of whims

[Post-car]
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you

[Pre-car]
Today I realize that you need
And I wonder, what would happen
Yes, suddenly, you will leave
Forever from my life?

[Chorus]
I am a disaster when you leave home
In the closet I no longer meet the ties
I am a disaster, and I do not understand what happens
I'm already tired of canned foods

I am a disaster, and without you I am lost
Your vacation spoils my senses
I am a disaster and I feel confused
I want to tell you that enough of whims
[Post-car]
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you

[Outro]
I am a disaster, I am a disaster
I am a disaster, I am a disaster without you
Orange orange ah ah
I am a disaster without trembed
