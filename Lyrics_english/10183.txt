No Romeo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sitting in the backseat
She's crying like a baby
'Cause he called it off already
It's only been a month or so
Wonder why he left her, if it was for another
And what she could do better
Let me lend some piece of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you hit an all time low
Take it from someone who knows
[Chorus]
He's no Romeo
He's never gonna be enough for you
He's never gonna treat you like he should
He's always gonna bе the one to go
'Cause hе's no Romeo
You're better off sleeping on your own
He's never gonna give you all the love you know that you deserve
'Cause he's no Romeo
He's no Romeo (oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Said she can't imagine
Living life without him
As if it were a habit
I think it's time we take control
Get up let's go, let's get off the floor
Put on a dress and walk out the door
Leave him behind and know that you're better off

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you hit an all time low
Take it from someone who knows

[Chorus]
He's no Romeo
He's never gonna be enough for you
He's never gonna treat you like he should
He's always gonna be the one to go
'Cause he's no Romeo
You're better off sleeping on your own
He's never gonna give you all the love you know that you deserve
'Cause he's no Romeo

Get up let's go, let's get off the floor
Put on a dress and walk out the door
Leave him behind and know that you're better off
Get up let's go, let's get off the floor
Put on a dress and walk out the door
Leave him behind and know that you're better off

[Chorus]
Cause he's no Romeo
He's never gonna be enough for you
He's never gonna treat you like he should
He's always gonna be the one to go
'Cause he's no Romeo
You're better off sleeping on your own
He's never gonna give you all the love you know that you deserve
'Cause he's no Romeo

[Outro]
He's no Romeo (oh-oh)
He's no Romeo (oh-oh)
He's no Romeo (Romeo)
'Cause he's no Romeo2Embed
