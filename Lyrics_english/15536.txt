I only live for you Lyricsolo alive for ta 
 I love you to death and nobody knows 
 Just live for ta 
 Save me, I want to be a felaz 
 In the Hand Warees 
 I have written: "I will love you to the last 
 Of the sighs it gives " 
 I'm changing customs 
 While change of attitude 
 Everyone who interests me are taº 
 A daA and another pass, the rain and the wind 
 But you, you never pass and sang my health 
 Just live for ta 
 I love you death and nobody knows 
 Just live for ta 
 Save me tell me since sa 
 And I put you in the clouds 
 You are a blue star 
 That steals me hours of dream and light 
 I just aspire to be your shadow 
 To be able to put me in your clothes 
 And walking to your skin 
 Spend one month and another winter and summer 
 But taº, with the Aa ± os 
 Siagues bothering Aaºn
