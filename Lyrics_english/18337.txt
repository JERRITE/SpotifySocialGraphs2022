Vice Versa Lyrics[Intro: Haile]
Pretty gyal, lawd ah mercy
She said she with her friend Kirsty
Hypnotised me, yeah she cursed me
Dem nuh like me 'cah they thirsty
And she know what is mine is hersa, vice versa
And she know what is mine is hersa, vice versa

[Chorus: One Acen]
Yeah (Mm)
You're my fire, holdin' tighter
What's mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe
[Verse 1: One Acen]
Aye, dem way dere
I ain't gonna stop on the m-way there
Cut through the lane when the m-way's clear
Would you do the same babe? Please say yeah (yeah)
On my grind, a lot of money on my mind
And I got a bag of girls on my line
But I told them other hoes boom bye bye

[Pre-Chorus: One Acen]
'Cah my love for you is timeless
Precious items
Diamonds don't compare (yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus: One Acen]
You're my fire, holdin' tighter
What's mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe

[Verse 2: Louis Rei]
Yo, check me?
I believe, I believe, I believe
Big chefers ain't the only thing I've got up my sleeve
Mama mi, mama mi, mami mi
She said "Me too" and backed out a rabbit
Stop ramping with me, I believe
Come hop on the saddle, buckle up please
