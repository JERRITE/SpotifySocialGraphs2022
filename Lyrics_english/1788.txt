Growing Lyrics [text of "crescendo"]

[Intro]
No-oh, no-oh, ooh
I got used to the dramas
Since I was like fifteen years
No-oh, no-oh, ooh

[Refrain]
Growing I am used to the dramas
Since I was like fifteen years
Then one day I discovered the grams
I asked: "Can you help me?"
But there is no one here who can save me
No-oh, no-oh
There is no one here who can save me
Who can save me from me
[Verse 1]
I come to the world on a bastard rainy day
Out of the belly the world that looks at me
I already had a choir in my head
Born laughing, they cried them
Growing I understood that the world sucks
That there is no true friend
The love of life is then finished and you find yourself exhausted
Growing I saw people change
People betray, people infamous
Around with the heart off: light
When you trusted you in it hurts
And if you listen to me as a teenager
The advice is: you stay as you always are
Without money you are poor, without dreams you are nothing

[Refrain]
Growing I am used to the dramas
Since I was like fifteen years
Then one day I discovered the grams
I asked: "Can you help me?"
But there is no one here who can save me
No-oh, no-oh
There is no one here who can save me
Who can save me from me

Nobody saves you, save you from you
Why are you looking at me, friar '?
Nobody helps you, help you
Fucking obstacles, throw them down
Growing the roads have divided
Now look bad who first smiled
Growing up everyone thinks for himself
Respects who remains themselves (is Jesto)
Growing up you understand, learn quickly
That changes destiny based on a choice
In the bedroom to smoke the grass
Music saves from a sea of ​​shit
Write with blood on these pages
I have a bad living, prison companies
I learned to smile when I came to cry

[Refrain]
Growing I am used to the dramas
Since I was like fifteen years
Then one day I discovered the grams
I asked: "Can you help me?"
But there is no one here who can save me
No-oh, no-oh
There is no one here who can save me
Who can save me from me
[Outro]
No-oh, no-oh
No-oh, no-oh2embed
