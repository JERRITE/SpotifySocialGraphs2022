Nor half Lyrics [letter of "nor half"]

[Verse 1]
They say you miss like the wind
You disappear by January
To go behind you
It's like persecuting, at the same time

[Verse 2]
I do not know what happened
What happened, we two
He broke
Here for you I'm still awake, oh
[Pre-car]
And although it is not even half of what was yesterday (every time, every time)
I return and confess to you
With a little of your kisses

[Chorus]
You know that I forget when you are with me
I spend the hours there is to see you again
And even if you don't return I want to be with you
I'm still waiting for you while I'm still caught
At night I keep looking for you

[Post-car]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
It is something that goes comes to you, and it gives you
That uploads to you and that you lower you
That you can't stop
No matter how much you try to go out

[Verse 4]
You lie, if you say the opposite of what you feel
Without you, what we were over
And I want to write to you what I feel
You Might Also Like [Choir]
You know that I forget when you are with me
I spend the hours there is to see you again
And even if you don't return I want to be with you
I'm still waiting for you while I'm still caught
At night I keep looking for you

[Post-car]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
(Sometimes at night I keep looking for you)
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Bridge]
You make me lose your head for you, you lose it for me
I go step by step to be by your side
And you make me lose your head for you
My head, going around, is for you, I'm for you

[Chorus]
You know that I forget when you are with me
I spend the hours there is to see you again
And even if you don't return I want to be with you
I'm still waiting for you while I'm still caught
At night I keep looking for you
[Post-car]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

(Sometimes at night I keep looking for you)
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
