Lyrics chew rubber ["chewing rubber"]

[Intro]
UH-HU, UH-HUH

[Verse 1]
Damn the day I found you-e
The time I looked at you-e-e
You entered my life, and now there is no way out
I was wrong-e
I didn't want and accepted
For a little while I kept you-e-e
I am not adorable
You are unbearable, huh, eh, eh
[Chorus]
Insufferable love
How could I fall in love?
I can't stand you, it's the truth
Because annoying and getting stuck like chewing rubber
In my shoe when walking
We are a non -ideal case
But I love you, I love you

[Verse 2]
In politics and faith-e
We do not get ready, I already know-e-e
I like red meat, you just eat leaves
And I thought

[Chorus]
Insufferable love
How could I fall in love?
I can't stand you, it's the truth
Because annoying and getting stuck like chewing rubber
In my shoe when walking
We are a non -ideal case
But I love you, I love you
Insufferable love
How could I fall in love?
I can't stand you, it's the truth
Because annoying and getting stuck like chewing rubber
In my shoe when walking
We are a non -ideal case
But I love you, I love you
You Might Also Like [Outro]
I am crazier every me-is
You insufferable and ve-e-ez
You are so vulnerable, so tender and so kissable
I will always love you
