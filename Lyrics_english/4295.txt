A more lyrics [letter of "one more" ft. Kira Brown]

[Verse 1]
The treatment begins to be good
Because they told me that in Sueno Street
The glass now I want to fill it
The bad thing is that then I miss you
Or together or I don't drink it
Let's get out, don't put a brake
If then I regret
Now that is not the time
And it is that, I know you wanted to shine
I was always willing to wait
Come on, let's go
Take the phone
Vamo 'to kill us
As we did
[Chorus]
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
(One more)
(One more)

[Verse 2]
With you ice I stop time
I know I was a fool
And I don't deserve it
Everything has changed
Give me a minute
I want your lips
I want your kisses
I want to feel very close to you
If you come, I show you Madrid
I don't know why all that ended
Give me a reason, give me a reason
You talked about love as the first
And in a second I took you to heaven
Yours is a I want and I can't
Men like you have hundreds
You are still drunk, child with fear
I keep stomping and without brake
In the background and your bottle hides the secrets
Those who show that you are not sincere
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
(One more)
(One more)

[Put]
And it is that, I know you wanted to shine
I was always willing to wait
Come on, let's go
Take the phone
Vamo 'to kill us
As we did

[Chorus]
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
Now that I call you and you don't give me a sign
You said that import but na 'de na'
All you did was so special
And now I only see that no more
[Outro]
Bad Base
Over the track
The magical recipe
Easy gourmet

Law now I only see that that no longer masters
