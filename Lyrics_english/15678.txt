I love you and point lyrics [lyrics by "I love you and point]

[Verse 1]
I have not been perfect
They gave me more than I asked for
Everything I have
Beginning with you
That you take away my air
This love does not fit in my chest
I'm indebted, heart
[Pre-Car 1]
I have a thousand reasons to question
That if there is a sky, it is not a place
Happiness is not a destination
And that it is only the same to walk
It was not luck, it was written
And I know that there is a god
Because with you blessed me

[Chorus]
I'm by your side and I don't believe it
You are not my eyes, but with you I see
I have everything, what I want
I don't fulfill years, but desire is fulfilled
Every day because you are mine
I'm by your side and I'm sincere
I know the entire world can end
And if that happens, start over
As if it were a January 1
Always together, to go to the point
I love you and point

[Verse 2]
I know the road is long
And there is much to do
But let's go calmly
What's so much to see
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro 2]
Take my hand, come with me
Or tell me where, that I follow you
I want everything, but with you
Before you I was lost
It is clear to me that you are my destiny

[Chorus]
I'm by your side and I don't believe it
You are not my eyes, but with you I see
I have everything, what I want
I don't fulfill years, but desire is fulfilled
Every day because you are mine
I'm by your side and I'm sincere
I know the entire world can end
And if that happens, start over
As if it were a January 1
Always together, to go to the point
I love you and Puntoembed
