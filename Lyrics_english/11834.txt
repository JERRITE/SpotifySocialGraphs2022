It doesn't follow fashions (Aka doesn't follow fashions) Lyricsya doesn't smile anymore
It is fixed all
If you go to the disco
Always dance alone

Everything already does not matter
It does not follow fashions
Turns on like fire
Abuse girl

Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dance alone
Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dance alone
Angry in life
Do not value that time decides
If they look at her, look at the way and lose the exit

Exhausta you hesitate
Tired of lies
He doesn't want to dance more
Princess of my dreams
He looks like it
Tell me who hurt you
Do you see you so alone?
Who made you use and steal everything?
Innocent heart, takes up the time

Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dance alone
Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dance alone

Tired of the same routine
With this rhythm that your body dominates it
A heart that vagabond walks
And want dance and go on top
Exhausted with evasive, tired of lies
Today you want dance and go on top
You Might Also Likeprincesa of my dreams
He looks like it
Tell me who hurt you
Pa 'see you so alone
Who made you use and steal everything?
Innocent heart, takes up the time

Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dance alone
Ay ay ay ay ay
I want to dance with you to love you at all hours
Ay ay ay ay ay
Come dance with me no dances Solambed
