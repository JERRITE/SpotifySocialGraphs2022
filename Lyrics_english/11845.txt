THE OTHER LYRICS [LETTER OF "THE OTHER" FT. Magical dromedaries]

[Intro: Magical Dromedarios]
I like to wake up, look at you once again
Sing your ear, later go to dinner
That you tell me "I'm wrong" and there is nothing else
Most beautiful thing in the world than by your side

[Verse 1: Gera MX]
I like your red eyes, smoking or says anything
I like to look close and smell like wet land
I like to write songs, kiss you at dawn
I like to sing with Drome, partying for Aunt Juana
I enjoy the requiny of that old guitar
I love to become mine, see you delineate the eyebrow
I enjoy far away while life is old
I love being who writes you, who eats you and advises you
I love every detail and that aroma in your hair
The taste of your lies while walking around my neck
I like to become the other, believe me, sometimes I don't even notice
Like you never noticed that you left me well broken
Depressive and already alone I had to burn your photo
If I'm still singing to you, it's not going crazy
Depressive and already alone I had to burn your photo
If I'm still singing to you, it's not going crazy
[Bridge: magical dromedaries]
It was really, you just had to wait
To see our face and tell us "no more"
Everything reaches its end, I had to face it
The handwalks will already have another place

[Verse 2: Gera MX]
Business lover, 47 dirty
You saw my face and it wasn't in any ad
In case you arrive and questions, nobody regretted
I don't know if they already told you, you were the one who lost
Going up photo with your vato, presuming on Instagram
And questions by DM "That puppy wherever you are going?"
Keep nudes for the stories, he forgot the decent
I like that I liked it, easy, that suddenly
I am seeing his gaze and net that does not regret
He is swearing to the two who are their entire present
They say that a nail another nail but I feel rivet
The whole exam passed us and I am still pure tache
They say that a nail another nail but I feel rivet
I have been alone here singing the pistache
(Yao Yao Yao)
I have been alone here singing the pistache

[Outro: magical dromedaries]
Nothing will be the same, I can't ag√ºitar
When I see you on the street and let's not say anything else
Not even a verse for you, I fell and I'm still happy
You had your moment, the rest is for meyou might Also likembed
