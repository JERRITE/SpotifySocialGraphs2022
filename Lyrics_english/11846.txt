I don't believe in love Lyrics [lyrics by "I don't believe in love"]

[See 1: Danny Romero]
And it is that in my story it always loses the good
The one who gives life for a signal
To say that her heart is sincere
Say that girl is not going to fail her
One of those I'm me (no no)
One of those I'm me (no oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Danny Romero]
That's why when they ask me how I'm going to love
I withdraw the look and under the voice
Because nobody knows that I have a curse
That always break my heart
And even if the good is me
They prefer the traitor
[Chorus: Danny Romero]
That's why I don't believe in love
You always break your heart
Happiness steals
And you don't really deserve this song
Does not deserve my attention
And today I decided to live happy
Drinking not to suffer
Thus drowning my tears
And I am really losing my reason, no
Drowning penalties in alcohol

(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Becky)

[See 2: Becky G]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
In almost all cases I realized
That love always leads me to failure
I walked in the sky with my feet barefoot
In search of a ticket that ended up being false
No, don't talk to me about love or come with things like that
Cupid who points to the other side that his arrows no longer work here

[Chorus: Becky G & Danny Romero]
Because I don't believe in love
I always break my heart
Play with my happiness
And it really, my time no longer loses it
I know I will feel better
And today I decided to live happy
Drinking not to suffer
Thus drowning my tears
And I am really losing my reason, no
Drowning penalties in alcohol

I withdraw the look and under the voice
Because nobody knows that I have a curse
That always break my heart
And even if the good is me
They prefer Tradorembed
