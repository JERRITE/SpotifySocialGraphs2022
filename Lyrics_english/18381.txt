He in his feelings, he call me to tell me it's over again ('Gain)

Make a hood nigga go to church just like Yeezy
Leave a rich nigga dead broke, bitch, I'm greedy

Ayy, on the low, he know that he been

[Pre-Chorus]
In his feelings
I don't give a fuck, I ain't got no feelings (I ain't got no feelings)

Plus you ain't pay no bills over here, so it's none of your business (Ain't none of your business)

[Chorus]
He in his feelings, he call me to tell me it's over again ('Gain)

[Verse 2]
He callin' again, it went back to back like he got a twin (Brrt)
The key to my heart is writin' a check, I might let you in, ayy (Let you in, yeah)
I told him to send me my money right now, I'm countin' to ten
One, two, fuck it, ten
He give me both of the PINs, ayy
Bought me the Rover, the Benz, ayy
Nigga be talkin' 'bout how he gon' close the chapter, but it's open again, ayy ('Gain)
He say I'm a jerk (Jerk)

Even when fuckin', I gotta come first
Put him on block, bet a nigga gon' lurk
