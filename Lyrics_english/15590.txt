Idiot Lyrics [Lyrics for "Idiot"]

[Intro]
HMM
Sofia

[Verse 1]
It doesn't laugh anymore
These are not the Blue tracks
Did you drown with pizza? (Haha)
Or how have you been?
Again in Ibiza (JA)
You cut your light
Did you lose the visa?
Or why haven't you arrived?
[Pre-stribe]
Is that
I always get what I want when I want but you don't notice me
It will be that you are idiot
Moron
If you knew that you miss the good but you don't care
You have me well idiotic
Idiot (idiot)

[Chorus]
Idiot, well idiot
Idiot, idiot
Moron
Good idiot
Moron

[Verse 2]
I am a very good girl, 100 qualification
I have everything well resolved, I live vacation chill
The best in Yoga, in Aikido, I give meditation
But you are an idiot
Come and take off your clothes without any condition
Water me the soup and you put the injection
I give you the first six letters of my reputation
You have me idiot

Who do you think you are?
Why do I put a crown?
Here the thing is not (uuuh)
Well, get the crown by himâ€” (Woo)

[Pre-stribe]
Is that
I always get what I want when I want but you don't notice me (no, no, no)

If you knew that you miss the good but you don't care
You have me well idiotic

[Verse 3]
I am a very good girl, 100 qualification
I have everything well resolved, I live vacation chill
Beer, billiards, dice, tacos are my tradition
But you are an idiot
That is why I have six drinks, two shots, a cigar
To get more idiot
Transome tequila, that this cumbia follows
And when I dance everything bounces me
Moron
[Outro]
Moron
You idiot, I idiot
You idiot, me another idiot
You idiot, I idiot
And together 'we are idiot'4embed
