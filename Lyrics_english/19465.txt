Grenade Lyrics[Verse 1: Ekoh]
Yeah
Walking like the pinnacle of skill when I'm steppin' on the mic and let the words fly
Y'all don't even see you're fuckin' with a different breed
'Til I'm liftin' up the lid of your third eye
I been livin' for the rap and the nerd life
Ever since I got a little taste and the fuse lit
They be brain dead, fuck tryna stop their movement
I am Bruce Campbell, this is my boomstick
Yeah, I be all day, doin' what I want, I know y'all hate
This a game like Webby's Arcade
Got the high score, fuck did y'all think?
Bitch I got paid (What)
Two shows in different cities the same day
Said I'd never make it out my scene, but I did with the team, that's Justice League and
I been making a name for never giving in
Taking Tylenol that I build, I got it livin' in
Writin' like I'm poppin' the pills or takin' Limitless
When I rap, Mortal Kombat, shit finish him
Killin' it, villainous, going on a rampage
I'm out doing everything they said that I can't face
I'm about to go and pull it off quick, band aids
Sold out show, rocked that, no mandates
Yeah, shits so mint got a Bitcoin flow
Go and get down on the ground floor
Fuckin' with the Webb and I'm gonna get green
When I'm coming with the bomb, Norman Osborn
Y'all might as well get your popcorn
Watch how they hate, no matter what I been on
They mad when someone looking like me kills the beat
Like compete fucked Kim, got 'em spitting over Kanye
Yeah I know these industry dude's don't like me
You couldn't do this with labels (Sorry)
I did this shit with some type beats
I don't believe in the hype and anyone saying they next to blow
Open your mouth, then put the grenade and pull out the pin and wait for the..
[Hook: Chris Webby]
We some renegades, only play to win the game
Life will give me lemons, I'll be sippin' on some lemonade
They try to imitate but they just a bit too late
'Bout to pull the pin on this grenade
(They don't want it with us)
We some renegades, only play to win the game
Life will give me lemons, I'll be sippin' on some lemonade
They try to imitate but they just a bit too late
'Bout to pull the pin on this grenade
(They don't want it with us)

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'mma set the scene, that's yet unseen
So fresh and clean, that nightmare up in Freddie's dreams
Here to bruise every MCs self esteem
My rap styles like ketamine, mixed with dextroamphetamine
My punch is harder than Butter-Bean
Alpha of alphabetic schemes
I'm kerosene with that match out
Chips up and I cash out
With the world on my shoulders just to work my traps out
That fast route is what I'm on
Dippin' off in a Porsche
Don't dap much better
Carry on with the torch
Too dark for the force
Way more like Darth got 'em all out of sorts
My dogs on the court like Air Bud in this bitch (Woof)
They don't want it with Chris (Truth)
Public enemy number one when I get loose, got a lit fuse
Don't tempt me, got the big juice like Simply, get it, huh? Yeah
Lemonade with a grenade and AK
Y'all big pussy like Stimpy
You don't want a war with the rap game maximus
Stab and thrust if they actin' tough
And then pack 'em up in a plastic lined trunk of an Acura
Then drive fast and I back it up off a cliff
Bye-bye, I'mma see you later
When the car hit "boom" it'll leave a crater
That's fuckin' with Webb in a nutshell, bitch
So send my regards and you meet your maker
With a piece of paper, I'm lethal
With a ballpoint pen there's no equal
Little bit of bad with a little bit of evil
Little bit of gas with a little bit of diesel
Yeah my tanks never on empty
When the beat bang, it's Webb in a frenzy
I am the one on the run they envy
Put 'em all ten feet if they tempt me
We some fuckin'
