I Love It Papi (Aye Aye Aye) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I like when you receive me
You keep me safe and warm
When your body starts to tremble
It's like a quiet storm
Girl, I love it when you wait for me
And hold on 'til it's time
Girl, then we reach the peak and the explosion hits
Girl, you blow my mind

[Chorus]
I love it when you talk to me and say
(Aye, aye, aye)
And I love it when you're close to me it
(Feels so right) Feels so right
I love it when you creep with me
(Creep that way) Ooh, when you creep with me
And I love it when we moan 'til three, feels right
(Ooh, feels right)
[Verse 2]
All you want from me is just to love you right
And never do you wrong
I love playing in your box when it's late at night
To our favorite song
(When I get this feeling)
I watch your body in the shower
Step into the beauty light
Before you dry off, step into the room
Damn, girl, your body's so right

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I'm looking forward to tonight
(I can't wait 'til the clock strikes twelve)
'Cause papi chulo's gonna make you feel so right
(Whatever you want)
Mami, I don't think tonight I can abstain
(I can't hold back, give it to me)
Lady, you should feel free tonight to scream my name, ooh

[Chorus]
I love it when you talk to me and say
(Aye, aye, aye)
And I love it when you're close to me it
(Feels so right) Girl, it feels so right
I love it when you creep with me
(Creep that way) Creep with me that way
And I love it when we moan 'til three, feels right
(Ooh, feels right) Feels so right

[Chorus]
I love it when you talk to me and say
(Aye, aye, aye) Ooh, girl, I love
And I love it when you're close to me it
(Feels so right) Feels so right
I love it when you creep with me
(Creep that way) Creep with me, baby
And I love it when we moan 'til three, feels right
(Ooh, feels right) Feels so right

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I'm looking forward to tonight
'Cause papi chulo's gonna make you feel so right
Mami, I don't think tonight I can abstain
