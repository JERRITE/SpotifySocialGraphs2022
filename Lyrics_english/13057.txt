Treehouse Lyrics[Chorus]
"Do Not Enter" is written on the doorway
Why can't everyone just go away?
Except you
You can stay
What do you think of my treehouse?
It’s where I sit and talk really loud
Usually
I'm all by myself
Ooh
[Verse]
I'm the captain but you can be the deputy
I’m really glad you think I'm so funny
I don't think I'm ever gonna let you leave

[Chorus]
"Do Not Enter" is written on the door way
Why can't everyone just go away?
Except you
You can stay
What do you think of my treehouse?
It's where I sit and talk really loud
Usually
I'm all by myself
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm the captain but you can be the deputy
I’m really glad you think I’m so funny
I don't think I’m ever gonna let you leaveYou might also like11Embed
