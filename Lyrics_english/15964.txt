[Intro]
Oh Andry

[Verse 1]

Overtaking the limit
Tell them the things they tell you
Tell me you do
Where do you go tonight?
I have a new car and you can smoke inside too
I was shy
I made a mess mo

Picasso
I asked Nada

If I'm not mistaken, I never create

I have a bad place next to you
I love you
If I am wrong at least I never regret
