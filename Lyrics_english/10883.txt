You Mean the World to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
The time I thought that we would have
Was taken from red to black
And I said things I can't take back
And I don't know how to live with that

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a darkness that I've known
And it's shaken me to stone
It kills me you might not know
After all
[Chorus]
'Cause I know I don't let you see
But you mean the world to me
And I know that I can be pretty mean
But you mean the world to me

[Verse 2]
What the hell is wrong with me?
I just sat there and watched you leave
I am not this ice queen
And you think I don't feel anything

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a fear that I've known
And it's cut you to the bone
And I'm so sorry I've never shown
Just how much you hold

[Chorus]
I know I don't let you see
But you mean the world to me
And I know that I can be pretty mean
But you mean the world to me

[Bridge]
World to me
World to me
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I know I don't let you see
But you mean the world to me3Embed
