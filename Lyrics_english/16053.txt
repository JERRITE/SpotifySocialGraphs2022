1st Class Girl Lyrics[Chorus: Drew Seeley & Marcus Paulk]
(I need a first class chick and the one that I pick
And you that she's gonna be fly, be fly)
I need a first class internationally known
It's crazy, could it be that lady to roll with me?
And it's you that I want, girl
'Cause i ain't ever seen it so hot, so hot
I need a first class girl

[Verse 1: Marcus Paulk]
I live the life of a star
What more can you ask for?
The funk will make you move
Like a bobblehead on the dancefloor
Gotta pay attention 'cause you know I got the cash for it Internationally known baby, check out my passport
It means I'm fly no other guy can treat you like I do
I love your smile look at them eyes, girl I'm so into you
This ain't no coincidence how I keep runnin' into you
The world's our playground G5
Where you wanna swoop we can hit new York
Ballin' shop and spend some moot
Ayy, baby in L.A. I even let you push the coop
Superman to Japan say I arigato I already got dough
So I'm known around the globe
Let's go
[Chorus: Drew Seeley & Marcus Paulk]
(I need a first class chick and the one that I pick
And you that she's gonna be fly, be fly)
Been around the world
You could be one thing I ain't got, ain't got
You should be my first class girl
(I need a first class chick and the one that I pick
And you that she's gonna be fly, be fly)
Say what you want but I know you've never seen it this hot, this hot
I can give you what you want, what you want
I need a first class internationally known
It's crazy, could it be that lady to roll with me?
And it's you that I want, girl
'Cause i ain't ever seen it so hot, so hot
I need a first class girl

[Verse 2: Marcus Paulk]
On the top of the world, girl, you won't believe the view
See the world at your feet, a fairy tale come true
No jet lag, got the best swag, you're my first class chick
Franchise dime, you gotta be my first draft pick
So we do it big from continent to continent
Don't worry about the money and just focus on the time we spend I'm down for you, you down for me that's 100%
On a trip with my chick load the bag filled with chips

[Bridge: Marcus Paulk]
I need a first class chick and the one that I pick
And you that she's gonna be fly, be fly
I need a first class chick and the one that I pick
And you that she's gonna be fly, be fly

You should be my first class girl

'Cause i ain't ever seen it so hot, so hot
I need a first class girlEmbed
