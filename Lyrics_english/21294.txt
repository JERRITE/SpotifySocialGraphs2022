Dime Store Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ain't it scary deep inside
Aren't you naked with no pride
Let me turn you on
Oh, I can feed you lies
Let me turn you on

It's no longer a game
And under your skin
I'm ready to dive in
Parasites on television screens
Hide in the cracks and
Underneath the seams
[Chorus]
Dime store rock
Has warped your mind
Melting faces, deep set eyes
Let me turn you on
Oh baby what's your sign?
Let me turn you on

[Verse 2]
Goes along with the territory
She wants to fuck you tonight
Please, smelling like on a wino
On her knees
Please, selling you her
Gothic rocket dreams
She's gonna burn you out
To make it seem
Like no one wants a thing from you
Cause you're a has-been on TV

[Outro]
It's no longer a game
And under your skin
I am ready to dive
In
Let me turn you on
Turn you, turn you on
