Stay lyrics ["stay" letter "] 

 [Verse 1] 
 You think I've already forgotten you, but you don't know 
 That in you I have thought without stopping 
 I feel that everything goes spiral 

 [Instrumental interlude] 

 [Verse 2] 
 What do you not see that with you I want to grow? 
 Stay with me and fill me with promises that cannot be 
 [Instrumental interlude] 

 [Verse 3] 
 Tell me that you are still thinking about me 
 Or at least give me a signal to revive me 
 Of this chaos that I feel, and take me very far 
 I promise to love you more than me 

 [Outro] 
 I would like to know what you really feel 
 I would like to know what is in your mind 
 I would like to know what you really feel 
 I would like to know what is in your minduou might also like1embed
