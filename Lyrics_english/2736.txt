Fuqboi Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's this guy at my school
And he looks pretty good
Always asking me when
We can kick it

Well my friends think I'm wrong
But he's not what I want
Cause he's constantly
Begging for pictures
And when there's cute things he'd say
I bet he stole 'em from Drake
And did I mention he wears his
Mom's earrings
I know he's tall and he's fit
But I won't fall for it
Don't want his hands
Or his lips coming near me

[Chorus]
Cause he's a fuckboy
And they're all the same
Like the stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy
I've been through it before
I'd rather cut out my tongue
Than let you kiss me with yours
Cause you're a...
Cause he's a...

[Verse 2]
There's this cute guy down my street
I always wanted to meet
So I went creeping around on his socials
And all the selfies he takes
His head is tilted the same way
And his favorite hashtag is beastmode
You might also like[Chorus]
Cause he's a fuckboy
And they're all the same
Like the stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy
I've been through it before
I'd rather cut out my tongue
Than let you kiss me with yours
Cause you're a...
Cause he's a...

[Bridge (spoken)]
Alright listen up people far and wide!
There is a growing epidemic
And it does not just affect America
But the whole world!
Keep your families inside
Keep them safe
We must eliminate these people
And if you elect me president I will
Exterminate each and every one of them!

[Chorus]
Don't want no fuckboy
Cause they're all the same
Like the stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy
I've been through it before
I'd rather cut out my tongue
Than let you kiss me with yours
Cause you're a...
Cause he's a...
Cause you're a...
Cause he's a...
Cause you're a...3Embed
