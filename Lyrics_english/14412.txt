I saw you lyrics ["you saw you" ft. Micro TDH]

[Intro: micro TDH & El Llane]
(Oh!)
TDH
21st floor (Oh, no)
Micro Tdh (no, no, no; no, no, no)
21st floor (no, no, no)
Ovy on The Drums, On The Drums (Oh, No)
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
[Verse 1: micro TDH]
I don't know what your look has
It will be your way of dancing
When we kiss
We feel we like
And when I have you in my arms
Time flying, oh, oh

[Chorus: dim & llane]
And when I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you (I saw you, I saw you)
I fell in love immediately, that was on the spot (-ato)
And now that you are here, here, here
I want to make you a good time, the best of times
And when I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you (no)
I fell in love immediately (Yeh)
That was on the spot
Now that you are here, here, here, Baby
I want to make you a good time, the best of times, Woh

[Verse 2: Pablito, Micro Tdh, both]
We gave each other for peaks and nothing has happened
I just wanted to know if you liked
When I laughed at you, I loved it
And I like crazy, lost in your gaze
That kiss we gave ourselves at night while
They are things that did not expect me
I felt that you liked it (huh!)

Has the formula and activity, huh
Give me a flight and start dancing, huh
I like you so much, that if you leave
I get nervous and start shaking (uh)
I am no longer interested ', mommy, the' others
Move that body and approach me more, to me (to me; huh!)

[Chorus: Micro TDH & El Llane]
And when I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you (oh, no)
I fell in love immediately, that was on the spot
And now that you are here, here, here (oh, no)
I want to make you a good time, the best of times
And when I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you (noo)
I love immediately (Yeh)
That was on the spot
Now that you are here, here, here Baby
I want to make you a good time, the best of times, Woh

[Verse 3: Dim & Micro Tdh]
I don't know what your look has
It will be your way of dancing
When we kiss we feel we like
And when I have you in my arms, time flying (BRR, Yeh-eh)
(Hey)
[Pre-stribe: micro TDH]

I get nervous and start shaking
I am no longer interested ', mommy, the others
Move that body and approach me more, me

[Chorus: dim & llane]
And when I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you
I fell in love immediately, that was on the spot
And now that you are here, here, here
