Holiday Hills Lyrics[Intro]
She on her way
Tryna party tryna chill
Know she like the way it feels
When you're living in the holiday hills
It's late, but you know she pulling up
I may never see the sun
'Cause I'm living in the holiday hills, yeah

[Verse 1]
Two C's in her eyes
Big pool take a dive
Bad girl bring the vibes yeah
My lips going numb wide eyed from the jump
She saw it and said she fell in love, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, anything you wanted from me
Ooh, take a trip with me anytime youre lonely
Ooh, I'ma feel alright her kiss too holy
I don't wanna sip it slowly yeah, ahh

[Chorus]
Shе on her way
Tryna party, tryna chill
Know she like thе it feels
When you're living in the holiday hills
It's late, but you know she pulling up
I may never see the sun
'Cause I'm living in the holiday hills, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
She on her way
Tryna party tryna chill
Know she like the way it feels
When you're living in the holiday hills
It's late, but you know she pulling up
I may never see the sun
'Cause I'm living in the holiday hills, yeah

[Verse 2]
Been up since yesterday
No time to decorate
Still on the road she tryna chase
Her life like a cinema
Drinking champagne on the sprinter bus
Took one look and she fell in love
You know
