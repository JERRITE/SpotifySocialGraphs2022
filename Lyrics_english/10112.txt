[Verse 2: ELHAE & Masego]
Yeah
When you're with me, know you'll never lack
Like a round trip ticket, always runnin' back, ooh-ooh (Oh-oh)
Let's rendez-vous down in Hartsfield Jack
It's always space for two, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
If you say that you want it, you got it, it's all in the fine print
Gotta be flexible, that's my only requirement
Wanna see your legs behind your neck
That's suicide like the doors on my
Murcielago
Pull up in designer (Oh yeah)
This ain't nothin' new  (Yeah)
You know me, you know what I'm 'bout
You know the tag, playing it out  (Yeah)
