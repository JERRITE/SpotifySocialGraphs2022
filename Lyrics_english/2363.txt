Sheâ€™s Casual (Acoustic) Lyrics[Intro]
Every night, I feel the same
My girl turns and walks away
Every time I hear her name
It's without her

[Verse 1]
And all she does is play these games
It's always been her claim to fame
Every time I hear her name
It's disaster
[Pre-Chorus]
She makes my heartbeat go faster
The thing is I trust her

[Chorus]
Because she's casual, she likes it
Mine and she knows it
Gives when I need it
Says to me "Can you feel it?"
She's casual but she don't mind

[Verse 2]
And from the dark to the morning light
She waits beside me and I know that I will feel alright
She's all I want to see
She won't ask why
I look in her eyes
I think I've been looking for you all my life
And you ask me what I've been doing with my time
I've been searching for you, baby

[Chorus]
Because she's casual, she likes it
Mine and she knows it
Gives when I need it
Says to me "Can you feel it?"
She's casual but she don't mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Because she's casual, she likes it
Mine and she knows it
Gives when I need it
Says to me "Can you feel it?"
She's casual but she don't mind

[Outro]
She makes my heartbeat go faster
The thing is I trust her
She makes my heartbeat go faster
The thing is I trust herEmbed
