I promise to forget you Lyrics [letter from "I promise to forget you"]

[Verse 1: Camila & Makis]
With you I had to understand
That can also fall
What we thought was love
Although I wanted to convince me
That your mistake was for love
Falling in love was my mistake

[Pre-car: Olga & Juliana]
And I know that you regret
A kiss does not lie
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you
And if you decide to forget me, OH-OH
[Chorus: Natalia, Juliana & Makis]
Do not ask forgiveness
Do not come back for my heart
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you
You played with what I gave you
Very late was that I understood
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you

I don't want more lies, it was enough I got tired
I don't want you to stay, I don't want you to see me again, don't
I promise to forget you, no

[Verse 2: olga & juliana]
So many flowers that you sent, kisses that you stole and I fell in love
Today I know what you said when you told me "I fell in love"
Tears that you didn't see that I kept
And that you never knew for you spill
How many times did you fail and I did not want to blame you, today I will not shut up

[Pre-Caro: Camila & Makis]
And I know that you regret
A kiss does not lie
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you
And if you decide to forget, no-oh

[Chorus: Natalia, Juliana & Makis]
Do not ask forgiveness
Do not come back for my heart
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you
You played with what I gave you
Very late was that I understood
If you leave, if you leave, I promise to forget you
You Might Also Likeno I want more lies, it was enough, I got tired
