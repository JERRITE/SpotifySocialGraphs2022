TranslationsEspa√±olSilver Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gather matters of the heart, so we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah

[Verse 2]
The needle on the spinning wheel collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn to let us in
[Chorus]
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again

[Verse 3]
The bodies lying in the sand, they're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
Feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness, infinite quickness

[Chorus]
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again

[Outro]
It is happening againYou might also like15Embed
