Just Canâ€™t Be LyricsRoberts-Hillman

You know I lost a friend the other day
She said she'd like to stay, but she's on her way
And I can't believe that she's leaving me
And it's been so long goin' on
Just can't be
Well it's happened before, well I never dreamed
It could happen with her, all the same old scenes
And it can't be true what's she trying to do
Be The death of me can't you see
Just can't be
What went wrong, well you know
I don't understand
But it's done and you know
I've done all I can
So I'll say goodbye to these tears I've cried
I will carry on, get along
I won't ask why
So I'll say goodbye to these tears I've cried
I will carry on, get along
I won't ask whyYou might also likeEmbed
