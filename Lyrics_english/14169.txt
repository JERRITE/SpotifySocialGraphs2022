Tidal Wave Lyrics[Verse 1: John Gourley]
I can see it in your eyes, see it in your face
Banging on your chest, acting tough, looking unfazed
Tripping over landlines, cutting deep with a dull blade
Running out of unrest, going out of your mind

[Pre-Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Lonely days will follow, days will follow
And the gaze that stuck the halls will know your name

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Aftershock, the aftershock
Triggered by the aftershock
[Verse 2: John Gourley]
I can see it with my own eyes, the tracks down your face
It can't be easy tryna unwind, sleeping on your daydreams
I'm not tryna role-play, these things can make us take the wheel
These days can break, but I'm gonna take the wheel

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Aftershock, the aftershock
Triggered by the aftershock

[Bridge: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Bet on the winners, worst of you's born to lose
Bed with no dinner, the rest of you's born to lose
Better than zero, worst of you's born to lose
Bet on the winners

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hit me like a tidal wave, ooh
Triggered by the aftershock
Aftershock, the aftershock
Triggered by the aftershock
Aftershock, the aftershock
