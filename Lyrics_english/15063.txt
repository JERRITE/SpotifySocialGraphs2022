Flashback Lyrics [lyrics for "Flashback"]

[Part 1]
I drive through the City, Bro in the Benz, and I can see how you go on foot
At that time I was one of the boys who strive for fame
Even if I was missing the courage at the beginning because nobody talks me well
Yes, I only pressed the last rows
I have never been one of those who says: "School was the best time"
There was only rapping in my head
From the ninth grade weed checking, I always had packs with me
I made little money, was on my own
Brother, I was already dreaming of a SL at the age of sixteen
Mareike was my first girlfriend
But unfortunately I don't quite fit into your world, today time passes so quickly
My teachers got it puke when I came into the class late
And that's why I'm never surfing on a school trip
They said, "Change, otherwise you would end up unemployed"
Today I earn more than all of them, that is the truth, Bro
[Hook]
Back then in school
My teachers could cry blood
Yes, I always had to be too cool
Today everyone would like to share this fame with me
Get so far when you think that your IQ is enough
Back then in school
I wanted everything, but never, as you are, I was too fly for that
Come on late, Joints turn and in the evening in the booth rhym'n
Brother, flashback, my life was never a coincidence

[Part 2]
The teachers at school, brother, have never been deformed me
Even if I made blue, I came to music and sport
I didn't feel anything except hatred in me for this place
The only Kanake on the Gymmi, I was like lost
It didn't take long for me to flog down
Although I would have packed my high school din it and you know that hundredpro
Came to a school with all the Canaken
I should learn there, but did other things
I had to prove myself more often, I was smaller than the Rambos
But was then allowed to go to the class conference due to abuse
My class books were fully tagged with lyrics
A joint during the break and the lessons was chilly
My parents became regular guests
Looking for evidence against me, but the teachers lacked tangible
Learned a lot during this time
I had plans in my head and never wanted to be like the other children
You might so like [Hook]
Back then in school
My teachers could cry blood
Yes, I always had to be too cool
Today everyone would like to share this fame with me
Get so far when you think that your IQ is enough
Back then in school
I wanted everything, but never, as you are, I was too fly for that
Come on late, Joints turn and in the evening in the booth rhym'n
Brother, flashback, my life was never a coincidence

[Part 3]
The women couldn't take me seriously, all goods on the hat, brother, cross bed
But today they see me in the television
Back then at school I was unindressing
I've never been to the punks, I hung on the bench with my boys
B-brother, turn joint (Paff, Paff), Turkish round
Today you are the real dogs
I do what you get in an hour in an hour
So baby, please think of Parham while sitting in the office
At that time all the other children complained
I wanted to be like Will, with the prince of Bel Air
B brother, at that time at school I was always a problem child
The psychologist always asked: "Do you have a problem, child?"
No, I don't have that, but I have a dream
And to sit quietly on this chair, I'm not just standing out
I always stared at the clock, when is the school over?
Today I pass the school in the Mercedes
That is my life
[Hook]
Back then in school
My teachers could cry blood
Yes, I always had to be too cool
Today everyone would like to share this fame with me
Get so far when you think that your IQ is enough
Back then in school
I wanted everything, but never, as you are, I was too fly for that
Come on late, Joints turn and in the evening in the booth rhym'n
Brother, flashback, my life was never a random
