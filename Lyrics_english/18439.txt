Pretty Handsome Awkward Lyrics[Intro]
Kickin' it out! (Out, out, out)

[Verse 1]
Your dream vacation
Is my hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
(Running a mile)
[Chorus]
Hey, are you okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

[Refrain]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Handsome awkward

[Verse 2]
Your market value
Your resurrection (Your resurrection)
Your shallow concept
Help yourself, I hope you choke and you die
I know you meant it
Nice fucking disguise, so hollow
Embrace the burn
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

[Chorus]
Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
You might also like[Bridge]
You look pretty low
You look pretty low

[Breakdown]
Your dream vacation
Is my hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

[Refrain]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Handsome awkward

[Chorus]
Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low, pretty low, pretty low
Pretty handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low, pretty low, pretty low
(Handsome awkward)
Pretty handsome awkward
[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Kickin' it out (Yeah! Yeah!)
Out (Yeah! Yeah!)
Kickin' it out (Yeah! Yeah!)
(Yeah!) Yeah, kick this out
Kickin' it out!2Embed
