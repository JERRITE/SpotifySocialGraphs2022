Peach Pit Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home
Not much is hidden underneath
A rocky heart for breaking teeth
And apple cores cyanide seed

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
[Verse 2]
Lift back and see the darkness hid
Swallowed up and angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim
Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you

[Verse 3]
Oh peach pit where'd the hours go
When your orange skin began to glow
From a hanging branch in gardens home

[Chorus]
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
This rotting fruit with youYou might also like23Embed
