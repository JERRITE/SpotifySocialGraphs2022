To pass it well lyrics [letter of "pa 'that you have a good time"]

[Intro]
(Pa 'that, for you to have a good time)
Yes, haha
Hey, I asked and She Said "Yes", Wow!
(Pa 'that, for you to have a good time)
(Haha), Ajá, Archangel, Pa '
Tainy, La Maravilla, Ajá (Ey)
Auh
[Verse 1]
She doesn't like reggaeton
She likes how the feeling sings
Wonderfully to the track adapts (aha)
With signs, quickly captures me
Chamaquito arrives, the little boy
The one that by the way does not have much beautiful
But the cats go crazy when I sing
Do not come 'to throw me that I' toy cura'o de horonto '

[Saying]
She jumps and jumps (today I give her)
Quiet (she knows who I am)
If you call me (I'm sure I'm going)
Ponte Ready (which touches yours for today)
She jumps and jumps (today I give her)
Quiet (she knows who I am)
If you call me (I'm sure I'm going)
Ponte Ready (which touches yours for today; ajá)

[Chorus]
And look for me to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
Approach for you to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
And look for me to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
Approach for you to have a good time
For him, to have a good time

WHEN I PASS BY IN MY NEW MERCEDES (Mercedes)

Come with me to see 'what I brought
Sensual and at the same time wild
Mami come back, collect your luggage (aha)
That again 'travel' (hey)

Without delay, take off your suit
And at the same time enjoy the landscape (yes)
Now I undo your luggage
Welcome to a new mission, Oh

[Chorus]
And look for me to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
Approach for you to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
And look for me to have a good time
For him, to have a good time
Approach for you to have a good time
For him, to have a good time

She jumps and jumps (today I give her)
Quiet (she knows who I am)
If you call me (I'm sure I'm going)
Ponte Ready (which touches yours for today; ajá)

If you call me (I'm sure I'm going)
Ponte Ready (which touches yours for today)
