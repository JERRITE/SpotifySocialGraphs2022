Song of the Rainbow Warrior (Part 2) LyricsThe desert bleached my reason
Possession slipped away
The sun beat down and burned the ground
I thanked it every day

When I called out for the rainmaker
And danced a ritual rite
The answers came on clouds of rain
And thunder through the night

And [drew?] I was a rainbow warrior
Crossing clouded canyons above the coke and chains
And [drew?] I was a rainbow warrior
Dances were the maker of the rains
