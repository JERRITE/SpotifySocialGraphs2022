Sail the Darkness LyricsThere is no return!

Coming from the deep the driving force awakes
Ain't got no warning out
Sail the ship and face the fear, don't take the break
The price to pay is worth the way

So take my soul, I will pay for my mistakes, oh yeah
Brave is the heart when love blinds the eyes in faith, oh

Sail the darkness, walking through the cold
I'm not afraid, I know the wind will blow
Darkness, take it to the core
There is no return
Looking for some help feeling despеrate
March of time is killing hopes
Nеver felt so lonely, all my dreams were gone
Pushing me against the ropes

Now take my soul, I will pay for my mistakes, yeah...
Brave is the heart when love blinds the eyes in faith

Sail the darkness, walking through the cold
I'm not afraid, I know the wind will blow
Darkness, take it to the core
There is no return

Sail the darkness, walking through the cold
I'm not afraid, I know the wind will blow
Darkness, take it to the core
There is no return

Darkness, walking through the cold...You might also likeEmbed
