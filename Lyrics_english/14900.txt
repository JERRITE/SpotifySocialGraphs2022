Mountain Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody has their own opinion
Everybody has their own opinion
Holding it back hurts so bad
Jumped out of my flesh and I said
Cash in

[Hook]
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby
Oh oh oh, oh oh
[Verse 2]
I was comin' down the mountain
I met a child, man, she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion
We had the same opinion
She was holding it back, hurt so bad
Jumping out of my flesh and I said
You better cash in

[Hook]
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby, yeah
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby
Oh oh oh, oh oh

[Guitar Solo]
