Worth It for the Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta be more careful with the shit I'm manifesting
Is this is all a dream or am I really being tested?
Out of five thousand people, of course you're standing there
Weighing all the options, running through my head
I think I'll take the chance, 'cause after all, what are the chances? (Just saying)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'causе that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for thе feeling
[Verse 2]
Might not look the same 'cause now we're both a little different
Had to find ourselves so we could find out what was missing
Gotta be honest, I'm scared to lose myself
After all the drama, I felt like someone else
But I'm stuck inside this dream, got trouble sleeping 'til we fix this

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling

[Bridge]
Forever, I've been asking for everyone's opinion
Never learned to trust my own intuition
Don't care if it's a bad decision

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling
