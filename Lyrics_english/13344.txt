Keep Running Lyrics[Refrain]
Every time I look over my shoulder
I’m getting older
I’m getting older
Every time I look over my shoulder
I’m getting older
I’m getting older

[Pre-Chorus]
Time is so sad
Tie me to it
Strapped to my side
Never look back
[Chorus]
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
Don’t hesitate, don’t make me wait
If you want my loving then you better start running
(If you want my loving then you better start running)
(If you want my loving then you better start running)

[Refrain]
Every time I look over my shoulder
I’m getting older
I’m getting older

[Pre-Chorus]
Time is so sad
(Don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, baby)
Tie me to it
(Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up to it)
Strapped to my side
(To my side, to my side, to my side, to my side now)
Never look back
(Time is up, time is up, time is up, time is up now)

[Chorus]
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running)
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
(If you're chasing things, if you're chasing things)
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running)
Don’t hesitate, don’t make me wait
(If you want my loving, if you want my loving)
You might also likeBaby, keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running for me)
Chasing the things that you see in your sleep
(If you're chasing things, if you're chasing things)
Baby, keep running, keep running for me
(If you keep on running, if you keep on running for me)
Don’t hesitate, don’t make me wait
If you want my loving then you better start runningEmbed
