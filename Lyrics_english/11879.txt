Ly lyrics hear [letter from "hear again"]

[Intro: Camila]
Ah ah ah ah ah

[Verse 1: Juliana, Olga & Makis]
Already, don't try
Nothing is the same, one day I will forget you
I don't know if you're yesterday, and I won't know
Everything is gray, I'm missing the voice
I can't understand what time wrote
And although I know that it is the best today I find it so much to tell us goodbye
And I don't want to meet you again
And I prefer to turn around and deny what it was
[Choir: Camila, Natalia & (Olga)]
I don't want to hear you again, I don't want to run the risk
Maybe I am wrong and if we talk I fall again
I know I'm better without you, I know it's going to take care of my time
And if I fall, it doesn't matter, I stop, and I start again
(And I start again) and start again

[Verse 2: Makis & Juliana, Juliana, Makis & (Olga)]
Already, don't fool yourself, don't insist anymore, one day you will forget me
And so many promises that you will not fulfill, they will not matter
And I don't want (I don't want to, I don't want), find you again again
And I prefer, turn around and deny what it was

[Chorus: Camila & Natalia]
I don't want to hear you again, I don't want to run the risk
Maybe I am wrong and if we talk I fall again
I know I'm better without you, I know it's going to take care of my time
And if I fall, it doesn't matter, I stop and start again

[Bridge: Ventino, Juliana + Makis & Camila]
Oh oh oh; OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, OH
Hear you again, oh
(Oh, oh, oh; oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
And I start again ...

[Choir: Olga, Camila + Natalia, (Juliana) & Ventino]
I can't hear you again, I can't run the risk
Maybe I am wrong and if we talk I fall again
I know I am better without you (without you), I know that time is taking care (time)
And if I fall, it doesn't matter, I stop and start again
And I start again, again IUU MIGHT ALSO Like1embed
