Freestyle Session #2 Lyrics [Freestyle Session #2 "

[Intro]
Zaramay, Nigga
Hey, Hey

[Verse]
Black, we 'argue' in alley 'dark'
Where they die speaking, where the hard ones live '
Send light in the neighborhood, merchanting the purest
Ten blacks on the street are ten black 'without a future
I don't want what I spent any son happens
I want to leave you a fortune and look prolijos
I learned this alone, nobody came and told me
What I like to turn it into a fixed job
They say that money cares and without him there is no health
Capable today, and tomorrow I am on the coffin
And you sit criticizing, black, in an armchair
Going to see how the parade, paca 'of one million
Here in the neighborhood, what is not in the news
We know yesterday what tomorrow is first
The one who took the shit, brother, is already sent
I want it to ', I am a black addicted to greed
If you want more confidence, my name is Agustín García
If I tell you it is because it does' what I already did before
When you were in the square, I was recording
You with Ole at home, I in the corner contrabus
Who know from adrenaline in day and early
Who know how to sleep with a gun under the pillow
You are not Pablo Escobar for negotiating Coca Cortada
I was dry in the pockets and they soaked
Ask my panas who is the most faithful dog
They will tell you "Zaramay", I later 'the honey whiskey
I'm going to cover your ass with a leather coat
And to the black one that fucks you, they will find him 'in the rail
What are you going to do, bold, when I step on a Chevrolet?
When a house hangs from my neck like offset
The luxuries tell blood, mommy, where I come from
I fuck whores but interested I do not maintain
A friend is the one who takes care of you, the one who does not invite you
The one who will be in the hard times of your life
Remember who I cry with you in front of a drawer
And to that in the heart, if all drug stamp and rum
With those pussie 'I don't spend, ma', I don't even look at them
If I walk with a fine picket, Bitch, Robert De Niro
Do not talk about trap, black, you raised you in capital
Here is the problem 'A fist', faca and shot
I got tired of making easy money, I followed her 'doing
Soon on the tv you are going to be seeing me
Not because they killed the black who ran
But on my right I will have a Grammy holding
Your mai does not know that I will have you as a princess
I am a rapper, that's why I don't feel at your table
My light, ma'am, does not prevent no head
If neither you nor your husband never had your company
Tommy shirt with Canuto in one hundred papers
Of quiniento ', of a thousand dollars and euros there are also
Pa 'judge me as a person, tell me, are you who?
If your wife deceives you, it's because you don't do something right
You will remember to 'what I said and you will throw me out of men'
If I do not come in my mouth I come in their breasts
There are toxic people who are full of poison
That never grows because they always see the ass of others
[Outro]
Fuck that shit, bastard
Zaramay, Nigga
