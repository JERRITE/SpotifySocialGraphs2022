Here But Iâ€™m Gone Lyrics[Chorus]
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Porched up in a rocking-chair
With my feet all bare
Rolling my blunt in a cigar wrap
Live an adolescent mind
Never do take the time
Waiting for my high, quiet as it's kept
[Chorus]
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Mama told me I was best
Argue and punch in my chest
"Son, now be strong, let me take you home"
I'd see in her eyes so sincere
Screaming, what got me here
Standing in the world and with my mind all blown

[Chorus]
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
You might also like[Verse 3]
I do nothing but waste all my time
Leaving the world behind
Smoking my crack just to keep me high
Around the boys I play my part rough
Keep myself tough enough
Never to cry
Don't really want to die

[Chorus]
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone2Embed
