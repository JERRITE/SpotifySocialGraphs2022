Realisation Lyrics[Verse 1: Kieren Webster & Kyle Falconer]
Man with a crown, the one that always frowns
I'd rather have a hat, than a broken back
Show you a man with a lot on his mind
I'll show you a self-confessed trendsetter-oh
Because the man said no

[Verse 2: Kieren Webster & Kyle Falconer]
Live like a king for a day, skint for the rest of the week
Say your nothing special, say you're lying through your teeth
It's just our way, why should we throw away a sunny day?
We should not!
It's just our way, why should we throw away a sunny day?
[Chorus: Kyle Falconer]
It's the realisation your not ten feet tall
The realisation you don't know it all
World domination makes you feel so small
The realisation of it all

[Verse 3: Kieren Webster & Kyle Falconer]
Stealing (stealing), coppers off your mantelpiece
Stumbling (stumbling) through life without one good deed And you're not living for tomorrow
Dealing with some sorrow
Competing with the neighbours
Waiting for that six number saviour, oh

[Verse 4: Kieren Webster & Kyle Falconer]
Buy some brew with some ill-gained currency
What a nice way to spend every day never had beamer
Never been a dreamer
Your barks worse than, worse than your bite
Why should we throw away a sunny day? (a sunny day)
The night has overcome your apocalyptic way

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer]
It's the realisation your not ten feet tall
The realisation you don't know it all
World domination makes you feel so small
The realisation of it all
It's the realisation your not ten feet tall
The realisation you don't know it all
World domination makes you feel so small
Realisation of it all

Take for granted Eagers omen
The stories lost its moment
Take for granted Eagers omen
Then the stories lose their moment
Take for granted Eagers omen
Dryburgh stories lose their momentEmbed
