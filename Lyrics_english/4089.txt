TranslationEnglishvete vete Lyrics ["Vete vete" ft letter. Ñejo & Dálmata]

[Enter: Dalmatian, Maluma]
Now you want to 'come back
But he is not going to be able
RUDEBOYZ
Me'

[Pre-car: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (you, you)
Now want to return
I don't feel anything anymore, I'm no longer pa 'ti (pa' ti; no; wuh)
Where you arrived, right there you are going to return (Yah, Yah)
Karma took your calm, that does not rest (rest)
Ours is yesterday newspaper
[Chorus: Maluma]
Go get out
With you you get my bad luck
Now I'm Mеjor, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you
Pеro please go, go, go
We are already like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you

[Verse 1: ñejo]
And if you see me 'walking around
Tell him that I'm already feli '
That I put another
That I already forgot you, that I don't love you anymore
It's true 'that I had to go a couple of days for Putero
And if you knew who I forgot you with
I was Feita, half chubby, but that in four is not seen
I remember when I saw you in the Lleras, that I changed sidewalk
Thanks to Dio 'that I would take it outside
Because I do not deny that it is' very rich
But I got tired of always rashing Marica's face (from Marica)
For me that he goes all for the cock (to the cock)
You were you who decided to throw it to shit

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go get out
With you you get my bad luck
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you
But please go, go, go
We are already like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you

Cupid failed the crush
I almost commit, but not
I almost tell you "I love you", I almost got on
And although that was not the case
I almost got pregnant, by little
For little I almost pregnant
Wanting to put a hand, I almost ended up putting the arm with to '
I almost tell you "I love you", I almost got on
But that did not happen, Valentín never arrived
Everything ended up being a failure
Cupid failed in the crush
Ours was not love
Ours was not poetry, it was fantasy affection
Pure custom and mania
What a day after day he made us
Imagine that there was a strong bond that united us, but
Ours was not love (Yeh, Yeh)

[Chorus: Ñejo]
Go get out
With you takes you 'my bad luck
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you
But please go, go, go
We are already like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you (bastard, bastard)
[Verse 3: Maluma]
And now it results
Of the problem 'I was to blame
Two mese 'asked' apology '
And I don't understand how now you ask me if I want to go back (I ')

[Pre-car: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (you, you)
Now want to return
I don't feel anything anymore, I'm no longer pa 'ti (pa' ti; no; wuh)
Where you arrived, right there you are going to return (Yah, Yah)
Karma took your calm, that does not rest (rest)
Ours is yesterday newspaper (I ')

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go get out
With you you get my bad luck
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel bastard, bastard without you

[Outro: Ñejo, Maluma, Dalmatian]
I already talked to Papi Juancho
Let's see if I hooked on the album
Let me do it even if it's a hook
Let's see if I buy a mansion
Tell me, Maluma
