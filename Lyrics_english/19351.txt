HDBG (Shemix) Lyrics[Intro: Tweeday]
Grrr (Run It Up)

[Chorus: Tweeday, cupcakKe]
Baow
This how the bed go (Baow)
How the bed go (Bed)
How the bed go (Grrah)
Where your ass go? (Come here)
Bitch, where your head go (Come here)
Let my hand go (Yeah, yeah)
Let my hand go (Uh)
[Verse 1: ​cupcakKe]
Make a "S" on your chest, draw that "S" on my tongue
He said, "How the fuck I'm gon' draw it?
I said, "Baby with your cum"
Not a wick with that dick, better knock me out my lungs
And I never needed no lube, unless it end with Vuitton
Pussy be wet 'cause you makin' it rain
Your deep pockets is what I'ma blame
Money hеist, lil' mama wait 'til he came
The dick just shot up thе bank of Spain (Grrah)
If the head ain't good then bitch, I'm leavin'
This ain't no motherfuckin' even exchange
I cut a nigga off in the middle of the head
Look like a bitch makin' Chinese bangs, yeah

Now come and put that dick up on me
Make it wet, bitch, can't walk it like Niaomi (Naomi)
Say, yeah, you ride, this ain't Bologna
Pussy hot like penne noodles on some rigatoni (Rigatoni)

[Chorus: Tweeday]
Baow
This how the bed go (Baow)
How the bed go (Bed)
How the bed go (Grrah)
Where your ass go? (Come here)
Bitch, where your head go (Come here)
Let my hand go (Yeah, yeah)
Let my hand go (Yeah)

I'ma show 'em how to twerk somethin' (Hmm)
Pop the pussy, I'ma let a nigga work somethin'
Yeah, he payin' 'cause I'm worth somethin' (On God)
No, I ain't that other ho 'cause I'ma knock you dead and hurt somethin'
One time for the bad hoes (Huh)
I ain't fuckin' with a nigga if he never bring a bag home (Bitch)
Give a fuck about a man ho (Bitch)
I'ma tell him what I want and I'ma get it, know I brag, ho
Spend it how I want it, it ain't nothin' to me
He think if he can take me up then I'ma fuck him for free
He fuckin' the P, I don't let him love on the P
And he know I don't gotta call him, I'ma run him for free, stupid

[Chorus: Tweeday]
Baow
This how the bed go (Baow)
How the bed go (Bed)
How the bed go (Grrah)
Where your ass go? (Come here)
Bitch, where your head go (Come here)
Let my hand go (Yeah, yeah)
Let my hand go (Yeah)

[Outro: Erica Banks & Tweeday]
I'ma show 'em how to twerk somethin'
Poppin' the pussy in the club
I'ma—, I'ma show 'em to twerk
One time for the bad hoes
Pop—, poppin' the pussy in the club
One time for the bad hoes
