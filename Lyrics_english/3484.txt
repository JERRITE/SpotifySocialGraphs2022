Buck 50 Freestyle Lyrics[Chorus]
Aye
I just been making the money, I won't let it make me
Funny I never run into my enemies up in the bank
Came from the block, you ain't good on the wave, have him walking the plank
I'm in the foreign, I'm smoking the same shit that's up in the tank (aye)
Racks on me, they not up in the safe (up in the safe)
Buck 50, that's a cut in the face
Racks on me, they not up in the safe (up in the)
Buck 50, that's a cut in the (cut in the)
300, that's a double up
I was gon do the plain jane but I floodеd her (hey)
They gon lovе it when you coming up
Asking me for a handout and I'm dubbin 'em
[Verse]
And if they go and start it, then we put this shit to an end (put this shit to and end)
I just wanna make M's, they wanna make controversy
Woke up today, and I know I got God on my side nigga only God could hurt me
Niggas ain't ballin, they thinking that they with the team, we can't even find your jersey
Ay, I hear a whole lot of talking, they never gon slide
Niggas throw rocks and then they go and hide
I'm getting paid, I ain't tryna go [?]
Go back and forth, niggas pockets be dry
Ten toes down, my laces is tied
Straight out the hood, yeah, whole lot of ties
I'm on the wave, niggas drowning in tide
I see you pussies be playing both sides
Don't come around like it's all good vibes
Don't come around cause I'm on bad time
We pack him up, tell that boy goodbye
They telling stories, they all tell lies
All they do is run they mouth
Big straps still punch you out
Tell the 30s go hunt you down

[Chorus]
I just been making the money, I won't let it make me (won't let it make me)
Funny I never run into my enemies up in the bank (up in the bank)
Came from the block, you ain't good on the wave, have him walking the plank
I'm in the foreign, I'm smoking the same shit that's up in the tank (hey)
Racks on me, they not up in the safe (up in the safe)
Buck 50, that's a cut in the face (cut in the face)
Racks on me, they not up in the safe (up in the)
Buck 50, that's a cut in the (cut in the)
300, that's a double up
I was gon do the plain jane but I flooded her (ice)
They gon love it when you coming up
Asking me for a handout and I'm dubbin 'em (no)You might also likeEmbed
