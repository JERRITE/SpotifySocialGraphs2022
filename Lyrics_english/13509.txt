Tsunami (Jump) [Radio Edit] [feat. Tinie Tempah] LyricsChick, Lets go!

Stuck in a daze I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze (woo!)
I hope its a phase, spending away more than I save
I don't know if I'm acting my age any more man, I need to break out of this cage

Stuck in a daze I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze. (yeah)
I hope its a phase, I hope its I hope its a phase (I hope its a phase)
I feel like I'm riding a wave
Tsunami
Jump!

Let's go!

Chick, Chick
Jump!

Jump!

Get on my level
You're killing my vibe and to get on my level
Time to be special
I be loving the rush of the blood in my vessels
I feel like a rebel
I got silver and gold I don't need me a medal
One for the night and I don't want to settle
Driving the bus with my foot on the pedal

Stuck in a daze I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze. (woo!)
I hope its a phase, spending away more than I save
I don't know if I'm acting my age any more man,I need to break out of this cage

Stuck in a daze I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze. (yeah)
I hope its a phase, I hope its I hope its a phase (I hope its a phase)
I feel like I'm riding a wave
