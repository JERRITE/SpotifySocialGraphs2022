C90 (remix) Lyrics [letter of "C90 (remix)" ft. Thunder]

[Chorus: John C&BHavi]
OH, C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90
C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90
I'm leaving, mommy, get good
I have a couple of phillie 'pa' burn with her
Move me that booty as you know, baby
'Toy setting the ground (what? What? What?)
OH, C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90
C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90 (CU-CU-CU, CU-CU-CU)
I'm leaving, mommy, get good
I have a couple of phillie 'pa' burn with her (Yah)
Move me that booty as you know, baby
'Toy, lighting the ground with the C90 (ey)
[Verse 1: bhavi]
Uh (ui, ui-ui-ui), se-se-se (se)
John C appeared in the C90
He made a lot of noise, all attentive people (UH)
A lot of sauce on top, Sorry, is not on sale (ah)
When I started I had no income
Now I laugh when I make the accounts
High mathematician and had not noticed, ey (Yiah)
Flow that holds, huh, ah, increase, wow (ah-ah)
Fresh, ment, mint, ey, moves it in slow motion
Pará, Pará, Pará, Pará
I know the voice is run and they recognize us (Bua, Bua, what?)
The Party got, the bodies perspiring, brrr (perspiral)
Pispea, I look at them as they look at me, OKEY ('Key)
Flexin 'as until the sei' (sei ')
They throw me from a sei '(sei')
Guacho, 'Toy crowned as king, ey
OKEY, I fill the suitcase (what?) Almost complete, the restless people
All quiet 'because Bhavi respects (SHH)
Not by mobility they lent me the C90, what? (Yiah)

[Chorus: John C, Bhavi & Neo Pistea]
OH, C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90 (UI-UI-UI)
C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90 (CU-CU-CU, CU-CU-CU)
I'm leaving, mommy, get good
I have a couple of phillie 'pa' burn with her (put good, put good)
Move me that booty as you know, baby
'Toy setting the ground with the C90 (ey, ey, ey, ey)

My friend with a Crypton but I go with the C
Four turras that follow me in two Honda wave
The poli asks me but I don't know
We take the drug, but review me
I pass with the motorcycle but grabs the wallet
Lady, I don't rob, my wallet explodes
I come from the neighborhood, that's why I have land (Yeah)
But I made us' a remix and we hit each other
Oh, Babe, C90, C90, I run next to Xtz
They invent it, they tell you, I no longer 'I think, they are Cinderella
I international as thunder, eh (ey)
I wait for John C at the airport, UH
And they want to kill me like Lennon
Smoking with bhavi, I don't find out
And now it chops him, how it chops him
It does not complicate me, Kush in El Pica '
I called your girl, communicates, ask for an appointment, repeated
Ah, ah, ah, ah
When I take it, I take it as armchair
I go with the jacket flying like a cape
The joint on the average and my paca backpack, haha

[Chorus: John C & Trueno]
OH, C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90
C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90 (CU-CU-CU, CU-CU-CU)
I'm leaving, Mommy, Ponte good (how? How?)
I have a couple of phillie 'pa' burn with her
Move me that booty as you know, baby
'Toy, lighting the ground with the C90 (ey)

'Toy liting the ground with the C90

[Verse 4: John C]
I'm without a weight, what I have is sex
Pa 'give him candle, if he wants kiss
I am calm, black, assimilated
Living as I want was always my style
It doesn't matter if it is missing, if I owe, I don't have
I look tomorrow how I fix it (ey, ey)
Day work, at night the brego (ey, ey)
The same is still shot and capable that I hit (Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
Again 'tamo' here (oh), I don't care na '(oh)
He says he wants to kill me (OH), I say: "Love and peace" (OH)
We are not equal, you can't even compare
Those that 'tamo' already ringing and those who want to appear
When the machine starts, baby, you lose control
She tells me "my love", I sing my song
I walk without paperwork 'dodging the fox'
Los Guacho 'from the neighborhood make me the choir
They can't get off, Manito (OH), I don't cry
They can't get to me if I'm on the podium
My baby likes bad life
He asks me to get it, burns it, leaves nothing
When I look at me, I want to eat it complete (haha)
Baby, go to the ship, the key, the C90 (ta-ta-ta-ta)

[Chorus: John C]
OH, C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90
C90, C90, arriving at the Party in the C90 (CU-CU-CU, CU-CU-CU)
I'm leaving, mommy, get good
I have a couple of phillie 'pa' burn with her
Move me that booty as you know, baby
'Toy lighting the ground with the C90 (haha)
