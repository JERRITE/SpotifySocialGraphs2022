I was waiting for you (live) [First Row] Lyrics [letter from "I expected you (live)"]

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for you and saw my body grow while looking
The name I gave you

[Verse 2]
In the mirror I was the full moon and with you inside
I was never so happy

[Pre-Car 1]
I was dying to feel your fragile legs
Kicking the darkness of my mature belly
Dreaming doesn't cost, no, and with wet eyes
I saw you so high, moreover, at the top of the world
[Chorus]
I expected you
Blinding the color of your gaze
And the bell of your voice
Dead of fear
I begged heaven that I let you go far
Much more than me

[Verse 3]
I was waiting for you and painted on the walls of your room
Dreams in color

[Pre-Coro 2]
Remained non -stop to the calendar days
Only you could heal the stage monkey
The world is how it is and I can't change it
But I will always follow you to give you a hand

[Chorus]
I expected you
Blinding the color of your gaze
And the bell of your voice
Dead of fear
I begged heaven that I let you go far
Much more than me

I expected you
And the mirror looked at us while I already loved you
