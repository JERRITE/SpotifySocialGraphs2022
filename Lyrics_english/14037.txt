April to Death LyricsThree bullets in a wedding dress
Well I know he'll kill me, but I love that boy to death
Felt it bad when he took those pills
Saying "ha ha ha, we're going straight to hell"

The smell of sweat and sweetness in your room
Yeah, I was scared, but what can you do?
You turn around and tell me it's okay
But my hands have still got the morphine shakes

I'm alive but I don't know where I am
Wanna leave but I don't know if I can
I'll drop out of art school
Spend my life in hotel bedrooms
I think I saw him slow-mo crashing on the interstate
Think I saw him sleeping through a hurricane
He's a violent man and his heart's decayed
He's a liar but I just can't stay away

Now he's smoking out the window every morning
While I get high in the bathroom
We're always on the upswing, baby
Phosphenes in our starry eyes today
April to our deathbed
We're always on the upswing, baby

He's got a new girl and I'm sure that she's alright
But he still calls me late at night
Never meant to leave him here like this
Voicemail sings a fucking wreck

I'm still written in his arm
Six years between the thing he wants
Nose bleeds like an afterthought
Baby, don't breathe out, it's all we've got

Live life on endless holiday
You're so fun but I've got bills to pay
I don't love any of these men
Just want to feel the most I can
You might also likeAnd he's smoking out the window every morning
While I get high in the bathroom
We're always on the upswing, baby
Phosphenes in our starry eyes today
April to our deathbed
We're always on the upswing, baby

Soft skin press cold hands sleep sweet sleep gentle
Hey, baby, are you okay? you're always on my mind
Coffee stains, radio static, slice my collarbones
I love a boy who's made of gold
I love a boy with curly hair and river eyes

Now he's smoking out the window every morning
While I get high in the bathroom
We're always on the upswing, baby

Lightning in our fingertips today
I jump each time you touch me
We're always on the upswing, baby
Phosphenes in our starry eyes today
April to our deathbed
We're always on the upswing, baby3Embed
