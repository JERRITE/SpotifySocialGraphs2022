STOP CALLIN ME Lyrics[Intro]
*Phone Call*

[Hook]
Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just here bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about these fuck niggas, so fuck off

Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just here bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about these fuck niggas, so fuck off
[Verse 1]
Bitch I don’t care, why you acting innocent
Calling me crying, gon make no difference
You cheated on me, had me for the clout
Saw this nigga was my friend, so I had to knock him out
We ain’t friends no more, cause' a bitch got between us
He wanted to talk, but I ain’t got time to discuss
So fuck him, and fuck you, y’all forbid
Stop acting innocent, you did what did

[Hook]
Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just here bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about thеse fuck niggas, so fuck off

Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just hеre bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about these fuck niggas, so fuck off

[Verse 2]
Listen, Ima tell you this, very fucking clear
When I talked, you never listen, so you better hear
I don’t care what you say, why don’t you just go gay
Living like you in, Paleto Bay
Go ahead and shoot your shoot, like Shaq
Shit finna bounce everywhere, then bounce back
You missed so leave, I don’t give a fuck
You might as well go give him, a head suck
You might also like[Hook]
Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just here bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about these fuck niggas, so fuck off

Rain falling, tears falling
Drinking Henny to walk it off
Rich niggas balling, but I’m just here bawling
Oh, but I ain’t gonna walk this off
I don’t care about these fuck niggas, so fuck offEmbed
