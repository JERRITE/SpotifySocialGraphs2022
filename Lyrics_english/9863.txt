Borderline Lyrics[Intro]
(Purple K)
(I get my work from the narco)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I hang with the killers and be where the crooks be
Known to terrorize shit, so certain places won't book me
I'll put it in their face every time they try to no-look me
I'm not proud of this new era, all these niggas is pussies
And they ain't talking 'bout shit, no, they just kicking they rhymes
I don't lie about shit, no, I just come every time
I don't think these niggas' bank accounts say more than mine
Real nigga, I'm gon' meet you at the borderline
[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
They know I'm that nigga, they scared to admit it
202 my area code, your bitch got the digits
Tryna see if this real or not, come see how I'm living
We can pull up on a menace anytime in them trenches
And I don't care none 'bout no fame, got me a few M's, then I'm winning
They thought I made it out the game, I always had a foot in it
I sent a nigga on a hit, but he got caught 'fore he finished
Of course he ratted like a bitch and still ain't get lighter sentence
Stop asking for old Glizzy, I'm a grown-ass man
And if you know Glizzy, know I'm holding it down
And they ain't know your favorite opp doing no dance
And you can't change my life because it's not on the 'Gram (Ah)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I hang with the killers and be where the crooks be
Known to terrorize shit, so certain places won't book me
I'll put it in their face every time they try to no-look me
I'm not proud of this new era, all these niggas is pussies
And they ain't talking 'bout shit, no, they just kicking they rhymes
I don't lie about shit, no, I just come every time
I don't think these niggas' bank accounts say more than mine
Real nigga, I'm gon' meet you at the borderline

[Verse 2: EST Gee]
Cash him out soon as it touch, ain't tryna owe him a dime
You can hear it when I'm near, I'm hissin', know I'm a slime
Know what's on the line, but slide like we ignorin' the time
Trenches turned me to a lion, I'm protectin' my pride
Got my blower, I ain't going, boy, one of us dyin'
Don't talk to me about no bullets 'less you took more than five
Wanna cry, they want my freedom, I'm a gladiator
Still give out spankings, I ain't satisfied, I'm aggravated
Fuck it, we gon' clutch it, baby
Want us, they gon' have to chase us, real Percs, I taste it
Talk with Red, angry in a way, I wish that I could switch you places
Heaven might not take me, it's an opp up there might try to snake me
Hundred shots, he live, we make sure double back and get him later
Freaky with this yeeky, hit him twice, that's double penetration
I compare these rappers to wrestling, but they really faker
We was poor since we was born, from war, we had to take it
All my lil' brothers is gangsters, go get him if I say it

Real nigga, I'm gon' meet you at the borderline1Embed
