I WISH I COULD HATE YOU FOR BREAKING ME AND CALLING IT LOVE Lyrics[Verse 1]
Holding my breath, playing pretend
Acting like you'll never hurt me again
And why does your love come with a punch
That I'll keep takin' again and again?

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times will you apologize
And say that you're ready to change?

[Chorus]
I wish I could hate you
For breaking me, callin' it love, I made you
Stay when you wanted to run, tell you
I can't love the same 'cause you threw me away
And why couldn't I be enough?
[Verse 2]
And sometimes I felt being somebody else
'Cause you never cared even 'til the end
If only you'd be just into me
But you keep on fuckin' me up in the head

[Chorus]
I wish I could hate you
For breaking me, callin' it love, I made you
Stay when you wanted to run, tell you
I can't love the same 'cause you threw me away
And why couldn't I be enough?
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I don't know love, mm
From what you've done

[Chorus]
I wish I could hate you
For breaking me, callin' it love, I made you
Stay when you wanted to run, tell you
I can't love the same 'cause you threw me away
And why couldn't I be enough?You might also likeEmbed
