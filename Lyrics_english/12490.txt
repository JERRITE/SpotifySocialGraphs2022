Coming Apart Lyrics[Verse 1]
The road was brighter at the beginning
When I lived inside a dream
Is it too late now for you to see me
When I'm breaking at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the one thing I can't, I can't lose
You're my one thing

[Chorus]
Hold on, I'm coming apart
I'm gone, but not too far
Hold on, be strong
Don't give up on me today
Don't give up on me today
I'm coming apart, don't give up on me
I'm coming apart, don't give up on me
[Verse 2]
I'm still clinging to the memory
Is it fooling, fooling me
My only bliss in what I'm forgetting
Wish I could take it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're the one thing I can't, I can't lose
You're the one thing

[Chorus]
Hold on, I'm coming apart
I'm gone, but not too far
Hold on, be strong
Don't give up on me today
Don't give up on me today
I'm coming apart, don't give up on me
I'm coming apart, don't give up on me

[Refrain]
You're the one thing I can't, I can't lose

[Chorus]
Hold on, I'm coming apart
I'm gone, but not too far
Hold on, be strong
Don't give up on me today
Don't give up on me today
I'm coming apart, don't give up on me
I'm coming apart, don't give up on meYou might also like1Embed
