[Verse 3: Farina]
With me they have to suck the de'o, this bitch is delicious
I leave 'and upload content to the' Rede 'and they tell me: "I Miss You"
I win even to breathe and cough in a beat, I became vicious
I make them change ex officio, the presidential of the building
I have a pair of children and that I don't get pregnant '
I looked for baby sitter because I filled the bag, I'm destined ', bae
I come from neighborhood, I don't put Feka 'in the neighborhood of others, my swag feels
And if they are going to snore, that is not with things that I did, they see them. '
