I wear my jeans - Mijangos RadiDit Lyricsno I need more age

As my dad says

To be able to fall in love

There is no limit time

Every time I see it pass

Again that sensation
Butterflies in my mind

And in my heart

I'm going to call your attention with discretion

I'm going to make it look at me

And this afternoon he invites me to go out

I get my jeans

Flirty way like my sister does

Moving the hip when walking

I get my jeans

Old hits today will be my allies

To make that boy a mannequin

I get my jeans

Every time I see it pass
You might also like that new sensation

Butterflies in my mind

And in my heart

I'm going to call your attention with discretion

I'm going to make it look at me

And this afternoon he invites me to go out

I get my jenas

Flirty way like my sister does

Moving the hip walking

I get my jenas

Old, landlords

Today will be my allies

To make that boy a mannequin
I get my jenas

Flirty way like my sister does

Moving the hip walking

I get my jenas

Old, landlords

Today will be my allies

To make that boy a mannequiembed
