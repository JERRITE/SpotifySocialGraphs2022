If We Stay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well these floors have start to cave, ain't seen the sun in days
You keep on playing safe like you’re too scared to move
You know there's more than this right at your fingertips
There's so much that you’re missing locked up in that room, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You had that fire in your soul
I don't know how you lost it
You held the magic in your hands
I don't know where you dropped it
I've seen the stars light up your face at night, and I promise
Don't think about it, let's leave right now
[Chorus]
Open your bright eyes
'Cause it won't be long ’til we’re out of time
There's a world outside
That you’ll never know if we stay home

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
That we'll never know if we stay home

[Verse 2]
Go 'head and spin the globe right down this open road
Outside your comfort zone, the stories to be told
Why would you fall asleep? You could make history
Life is a mystery just waiting to unfold

[Pre-Chorus]
You had that fire in your soul
I don't know how you lost it
You held the magic in your hands
I don’t know where you dropped it
I've seen the stars light up your face at night, and I promise
Don't think about it, let's leave right now

[Chorus]
Open your bright eyes
'Cause it won't be long 'til we're out of time
There's a world outside
That you'll never know if we stay home

Oh, oh, oh
That we'll never know if we stay home
Oh, oh, oh
That we'll never know if we stay homeEmbed
