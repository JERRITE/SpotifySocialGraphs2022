Weâ€™re Not Alone (Remix) Lyrics(A lover)

This feeling has a thousand limbs, all the hers and his
Tell me do you like it? (I like it)
Too big to fit in this skin, this skin I'm in
Because I'm a lover
Breathe out, breathe in!
I won't live like the dead, come to life again
Because I'm a lover (A lover)
For the first time I open my eyes and feel alive
That's cuz I'm a lover
We're not alone in this psychodrome, but I know that I don't want to lose you
Living the dream, if you know what I mean, and I'll be that boy you used to know
I'm not alone, I've got this microphone, and you know that I ain't gonna fool you
Be that king, try to be that queen and you wouldn't save it!

(A lover)
(A lover)

Open me like a door, a flower or a book, a cloud when it rains
(A lover)
There's nobody in the streets, or in their homes
Just skies and window panes
Breathe out, breathe in!
Got to sack this poisoned feeling, let my mind be clean
Because I'm a lover (A lover)
Dreaming won't heal, here's a clue
I am here for you, I'll be your provider

We're not alone in this psychodrome, but I know that I don't want to lose you
Afraid of the wars behind closed doors where I'm just a baby in your arms
I'm not alone, I've got this microphone, and you know that I ain't gonna fool you
We watch TV, read a magazine, just to keep our minds erased
Keep our minds erased!

We're not alone in this psychodrome, but I know that I don't want to lose you
Our love is made like a Starbucks chain, and we're taking over this neighborhood!
We're not alone in this psychodrome, and I know that I don't want to lose you
We're living the dream if you know what I mean, and I'll be that boy you used to know
We're not alone in this psychodrome, and I know that I don't want to lose you
Afraid of the wars, behind closed doors where I'm just a baby in your arms
You might also likeWe're not alone
Not alone
(I don't wanna lose you)1Embed
