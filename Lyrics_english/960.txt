She (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics of "She (Remix)"]

[Enter: Boza, Lenny Tavárez & Lunay]
She has something to me— (Boza, Je m'appelle)
(This is the remix)
I am always for the return, but today I want to get lost with you (with you, Woh, Woh, Woh)
Come and do it 'as a lover', I later tell me 'as a friend' (I am)
Sometimes your drug, sometimes your dealer
I eat it and she doesn't even follow me
She changed for a mistake, she knows '(she knows it')
He didn't go down, she got him
His heart put it plane mode (plane mode)
He left you alone and what he does not know what a close
From me you always excite you '
Because I'm that other who wins them 'takes you away, ah-ah
[Chorus: Boza]
I like everything about you, I like it 'you
I like how it speaks to me 'and your actitu' (uh)
I like how the tattoo are seen (UH-UH)
And when he smokes 'you burn' like Kung-Fu
I like everything about you, I like it 'you
I like how it speaks to me 'and your attitude'
I like how the tattoo look like '
And when he smokes 'you burn' like Kung-Fu

[Verse 1: Lunay]
I like you, your skin, your smile (haha)
Much 'throw, what gives e' laugh (laugh)
I like your hair when the breeze gives it
And I do it, calmly, without hurry (JA)
When Pa'l Mall goes (eh), I give him my visa
The suite in front of the sea, enjoys the view
Ask what he wants, 'Baby, you let me know' (AH)
I take you to Palooza, I do it 'in Ibiza (ah)
The BR from PR to RD has the movie in play, warm 'hd
Tell that bastard not to continue in his
If I don't give him 'apartment like Bin Laden
Capsulendo in the Uru '
The smoke leaving Sunroof
Oh, mommy, you made me a voodoo (ey-ey-ey)
When I saw that, I said "uff" (me ')
In bed a series that neither Hulu
That 'pantycito' waterproof
Under the sheets' Christian Lu
The only one I want is you

[Verse 2: Lenny Tavárez & Juhn]
She comes out and perreate, smokes and the 'eye' look like Korea
She does not chorus, but to'a the Korea
I do the task to the teacher
Y-and-and-and work well, I always get a hundred
And the little boyfriend, Yeyesito, does not look at me well
What xopa my friend?
I already passed the retainer
And I carry the merca, well
Sometimes your drug, sometimes your dealer
I eat it (Oh!), She doesn't even follow me (they tell me Juhn "El Allstar", Baby)

[Verse 3: juhn]
I like everything about you, I want to leave you inside
That ass of you has a good disconentra'o
Leave me the open door, do not leave 'na' cerra'o (hahahaha)
I'm going to enter your home as a thief
Smokes molasses and is booked
Divine, from Buenos Aires, Argentina (Oh!)
How it moves it fascinates me (hahahaha)
After we fuck kitchen
And I eat it again, because love is delicious (very delicious)
He gave me a little and sent me (and sent me)
Fumamo 'and stay' Loquo '(Loquo')
[Chorus: Juhn]
And now I like you, I like it 'you
I like how it speaks to me 'and your actitu' (-uu ', uh-uh; yah, yah)
I like how the tattoo look like '
And when he smokes 'you burn' like Kung-Fu

[Verse 4: beéle]
I like how it speaks to me, I like how it has me
I like what it does to me, I like 'the weekene'
I like the escape 'and the fotico' of your Rede '
Wet 'Lejo', which lies' everything flows and nothing influences
You want 'that down' and your sheet 'I sneak out
My pillow 'remind you of the rich' and your perfume
To 'kiss them' that you give me are the ones who attribute you
You filled all my gallery of to 'your nud's, baby

[Verse 5: Boza]
The ex-boyfriend is slow
I kept that baby's ass
She wants a tiguere who always walks attentive
That is more real and worthy
Without thinking I come inside
You know you have fans
Who are looking at what you do
But you stay alone whatever happens
She has something that attracts me, that distracts me
How crazy it brings me, eh-eh

[Chorus: Boza]
I like everything about you, I like it 'you
I like how it speaks to me 'and your attitude'
I like how the tattoo look like '
And when he smokes 'you burn' like Kung-Fu
I like everything about you, I like it 'you
I like how it speaks to me 'and your attitude'
I like how the tattoo look like '
And when he smokes 'you burn' like Kung-Fu
