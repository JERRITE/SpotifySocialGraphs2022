Iâ€™ll Call U Back Lyrics[Verse]
I'm in the kitchen
I'm cooking and mixing
And fixing the sauces
And I'll call you back
Running around in the city
I run it, I like it
I'm busy, so I'll call you back
Flipping the switches
And bitches, come witness
The joy and the feelings
And I'll call you back
Never the life of the party
But I get it started
It's business and
I'll call you back
[Chorus]
It's business, we've been this
It's business, we've been this and I'll call you back
It's business, it's business
It's business, it's business and I'll call you back
It's business, we've been this
It's business, we've been this and I'll call you back
It's business, it's business
It's business, it's business and I'll call you

[Outro]
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
And I'll call you back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, backYou might also like1Embed
