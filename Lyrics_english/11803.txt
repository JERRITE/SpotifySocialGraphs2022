Too bad love lympsaqu√≠ I am, (here I am), (here I am), (here I am)
Here I am, (here I am), it hurts so much love (of so much love)
Here I am, (here I am), (here I am)
Here I am, tell me what we have to talk about
I do not get your attitude
And much less
Because you have to call me
I'm sorry for if you realized
Now that it is too late
If you have not noticed
I have fallen again
She arrived when I was empty
You left me alone
By the way what happened
With whom you took my place
I beg you to stay with me
Life now has turned
And fate
Everything makes you pay
And now another occupies your place
Someone good
That shake hands, which told me enough
You don't have to cry
And now another occupies your place
SHOT OF SO LOVE
I waste
Thinking of you
So many tears that spill
And all the time I lost for you
How can you return like this after so long
Like nothing
But nothing is what I feel to see you
And I would thank you for never calling
I don't want her to feel jealous of something that is no longer important
And now another occupies your place
Someone good
That shake hands, which told me enough
You don't have to cry
And now another occupies your place
SHOT OF SO LOVE
I waste
Thinking of you
So many tears that spill
And all the time I lost for you
And demonstrating who has control of the romantic genre from Digital Records what it is ...
A lot
And now another occupies your place
Someone good
That shake hands, which told me enough
You don't have to cry
And now another occupies your place
SHOT OF SO LOVE
I waste
Thinking of you
So many tears that spill
And all the time I lost for you ...... You Might Also Likeembed
