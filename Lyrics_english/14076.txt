Artificial Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody cares for any bit of honesty
But you girl
You move like an angel that landed in the streets of a long ago New York

Oh, can you keep a secret
Kinda wanna taste it
Give me artificial paradise


[Chorus 1]
Numb me ‘till I feel emotion
Beat me up so I can fight for what I believe in
Trip me so I fall all the way up to heaven
Plug me in and take whatever makes me human

[Verse 2]
We're falling asleep and nobody’s fighting it, anymore
We beg for release but I don't know what it means to be free anymore

Oh, can you keep a secret
Kinda wanna taste it
Give me artificial paradise
Wouldn't it be easy
Put me down and tease me
Give me artificial paradise


[Chorus 2]
Blind me so I see the beauty
Shut me up so I can finally sing your music
Plug me in and turn it all the way to eleven
Fuck me up and take whatever I’ve been given


[Outro]
Artificial, artificial paradise
Artificial, artificial paradise
Artificial, artificial paradise
Plug me in and take whatever makes me humanYou might also likeEmbed
