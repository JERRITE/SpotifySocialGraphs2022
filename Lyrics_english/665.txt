La Boca (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics of "La Boca (Remix)"]

[Enter: Lunay]
Cantame Mau and Ricky
Lu-Lu-Lunay, Yeh

[Saying: Lunay, Mau and Ricky]
Although 'I was looking for, I keep keeping you the place (place)
And no matter how much I try that none will change you (HMM)
I almost even sleep for watching my cell phone
Just in case you forgot that you didn't want to call me (OH-OH, OH-OH)
[Pre-Caro: Mau and Ricky]
My body needs you
My mouth needs you (Yeh)
Why don't you come right now?

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
I'm dying for kissing my mouth, mom
I have been dreaming about trying again
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea

[Verse 1: Lunay]
(Lunay; Yeh-Yeh)
Baby, today I'm going to steal you from making little things about more '
Take out to clear (-pejar)
I just want one night to remember
Doing so you are vice, I can't leave you
Buy Pa'l de Botella 'and none Drink'
Because I can't endure 'the desire that we have'
Oh, baby, you look at me and already understand us'
I think it's a sin as I want to eat us'

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Camilo]
That I die for kissing my mouth, mom (although I don't spend time; Yah, Yah-Yah)
I have been dreaming about trying again (Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh; and now [?])
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance (Yeh)
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea (to the beach, mommy, and to the sea)

Mau and Ricky!
If I don't have you, I die (no, no)
You are not and the jealousy kills me
I leave the air if you leave (don't go)
Because life goes away
Baby, yes, I love you for me (for me, for me)
I don't want to share you (Oh, no)
As ice in the desert (like ice in the desert)
I melt for you (pra!)
Because when you are far (when you are not)
I feel that I get old (old)
I don't spend time (PAH-PAH-PAH-PAH-EH)

[Chorus: Camilo & Lunay]
I die for kissing my mouth, mom (I'm dying, I'm dying for you)
I have been dreaming about trying again (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh; I want to try it)
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance (dance, yeh-yeh)
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea (to the beach, mommy, and to the sea)

[Bridge: Camilo, Mau and Ricky]
NA-NA-NA-EH
I love you with me (I love you with me)
NA-NA-NA-EH
Please, I ask you
Na, Na, Na-Nah
I love you with me (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
NA-NA-NA-EH
Please ask you (Mau and Ricky!, Camilo, Camilo)
[Outro: Lunay]
Lu-Lu-Lunay, Yeh
Lu-Lu-Lunay, Yeh
Mau and Ricky
EH, P.R. In the house (house, house, house, house) 1embed
