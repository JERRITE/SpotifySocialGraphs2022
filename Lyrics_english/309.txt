Phone Me Lyrics[Chorus]
Callin' your phone, 'cause I'm lonely
Hopefully you gon' phone me
I don't cap, I'm no phoney
You don't believe, you don't know me
I don't be playin' no games
I just want you on the same
But you don't hear what I'm sayin'
Think that it's all just some game

[Verse]
Yah, yeah, I don't play
Yah, yeah, in the fuckin' A
Yah, girl, I go H-A
Yah, ayy, yah, ayy
Yah, yeah, you know me, babe
No, no, I ain't your homie, babe
Yeah, I'd rather be lonely, babe
Need your love come and put it on me, babe
Pullin' up, yeah you know I won't be late
Pussy actin' up, yeah, you know it's gon' behave
Give me love, love me like you know me, babe
Wakin' up then you know it's only eight
Got a hundred different reasons just to go and play
I ain't tryna share your pussy, yeah, it's only Che's
Let the city see your titties, girl, don't close these shades
She naked when she be with me, givin' clothes a break
Her pussy get wetter for me like it knows my face
She ride it until she come and make my nose ring break
So when I hit it, make her feel like she got no spring break
I hit it until the box, without no springs break
I hit it until the pussy look like it don't seem straight
If you coolin' with your bitch make sure you don't bring Che
'Cause she thirsty for the dick you know I won't restrain
I'll leave some water on the floor and no it won't be rain
Killin' the pussy make me hungry need a 4-piece mayne
Don't want your bitch she look like she from where the dope fiends hang
I'm in the city where the motherfucking coke fiends hang
Don't wanna fuck a bitch and give a bitch a nose bleed, damn
[Chorus]
Callin' your phone, 'cause I'm lonely
Hopefully you gon' phone me
I don't cap, I'm no phoney
You don't believe, you don't know me
I don't be playin' no games
I just want you on the same
But you don't hear what I'm sayin'You might also like2Embed
