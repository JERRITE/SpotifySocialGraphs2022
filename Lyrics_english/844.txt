Eivissa Lyrics ["Eivissa" letter]]

[Enter: Mora]
(EH, EH-EH
EH-EH-EH, EH-EH-EH)

[Chorus: Mora]
I got up in Ibiza, it's late and I open the curtain '
And how nice sunset, how night the one yesterday
The sun shining, just like your smile
Your silhouette a work, and my mind the brush
[Post-Coro: Mora]
Kisses how much ', I already lost the account
With you fell easy, and I didn't even realize
Do not think about me, I love you complete
I don't want a sample

[Saying]
Cream, cream, cream, cream
Mmm, take out the strawberry, baby, that I take the cream
Cream, cream, cream, baby
It is becoming a problem, your cream bikini

[Verse 1: Danny Ocean]
Let me take away from the bikini the sand (ah-ah), huh
Estamo 'in the nudist part of the island, without sorrow, ah
Between the summer sea and full moon gummies
We give ourselves salty kisses and threw it '

[Saying: Danny Ocean]
Cream, cream, cream, cream
Mmm, take out the strawberry, baby, that I take the cream
Cream, cream, cream, baby
It is becoming a problem, your cream bikini
Cream, cream, cream, cream
You already know how e 'the system on the beach, baby
Cream, cream, cream, cream
Your brunette skin kills me, remember 'Venezuela

And if you decide to do it, nobody finds out
The whole island for us, baby
A pa 'Formentera, the hot sun, you in a few fabric'
Thus I take advantage, baby, to take a little bit 'and

[Saying: Mora & Danny Ocean]
Cream, cream, cream, cream
Mmm, take out the strawberry, baby, that I take the cream
Cream, cream, cream, cream
It is becoming a problem, your cream bikini

[Chorus: Danny Ocean]
I got up in Ibiza, late and I open the curtain '
And how nice sunset, how night the one yesterday, eh-eh
The sun shining just like your smile
Your silhouette a work, and my mind the brush, eh-eh

[Outro]
I got up in Ibiza, late and I open the curtain '
And that-
The sun shining just like your smile
