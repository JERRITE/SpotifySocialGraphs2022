Like Belly Lyrics[Intro]
[?], hm
Faggot ass cops won't [?]
Runnin' all them red lights, smokin' weed, nigga
Fuck you
Yeah (JCabz)

[Chorus]
Iceberg, but I live my life like Belly
Runnin' red lights, make the police come and catch me
Can't drop a dime on a nigga, ain't tellin'
Only got the brain from the bitch, but she ready
Fat booty bitch like Keisha
Just like a rasta keep rollin' that reefer
Boy talkin' too much, he got killed while we eatin'
Don't got money, why the fuck is you speakin'?
If you ever try me, gotta make odds even
Overkill me a nigga, keep shootin', he not еven breathin'
Seen a fuck nigga straight rat on his peoplе
He need his ass whooped, man, somebody beat him
Somebody get rubberbands 'cause I need 'em
Count the money, stack it up by the even
Trap gon' beat that bitch in like a speaker
Her pussy got water, that shit Aquafina
[Verse]
I went through hell, pull off in a Demon
So much shit, man, a young nigga seen it
So much jewelry on me, I'm cold, anemic
Came from the dope poor, pull up in a Lamborghini
Straight up out the mud, ten thousand for the feature
Tryna run from the choppa, he must be a cheetah
My partner my brother, we rockin', no beefin'
No money, no hoe, can't never come between it
Got twenty by the kilo like my nigga Lil Tweezy
Bitch gon' dry that pack wetter, Tuskeegee
Take a loss, get that shit back, ain't then repeat
My dawg in the box, they seen me on TV
Block hot, we give a fuck 'bout the police
Lil Adam, he silent, that boy want my codeine
He told the police he don't even know me
They let us go free

[Chorus]
Iceberg, but I live my life like Belly
Runnin' red lights, make the police come and catch me
Can't drop a dime on a nigga, ain't tellin'
Only got the brain from the bitch, but she ready
Fat booty bitch like Keisha
Just like a rasta keep rollin' that reefer
Boy talkin' too much, he got killed while we eatin'
Don't got money, why the fuck is you speakin'?
If you ever try me, gotta make odds even
Overkill me a nigga, keep shootin', he not even breathin'
Seen a fuck nigga straight rat on his people
He need his ass whooped, man, somebody beat him
Somebody get rubberbands 'cause I need 'em
Count the money, stack it up by the even
Trap gon' beat that bitch in like a speaker
Her pussy got water, that shit AquafinaYou might also like1Embed
