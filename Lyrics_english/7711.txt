Eyes Wide Shut Lyrics [Text of "Eyes Wide Shut"]

[Verse 1]
I put my masks, one at pace
Tulipano petals on my stem
No, it's not a joke, a butt
You know that I ride the wave, Burlamacco
Arlecchino like Camerini
Yes, but only outside the dressing rooms
Because in I silence
Not external black tear on a white face like Pierrot
Fui Diego de la Vega
I wrote to her one last letter because I was already afraid for my career
Ghostface that evening
We left it by phone and found a knife in the back
Life is a masked, singing "Mas que nada"
How I had an identity that is never revealed
I with the mask as an artist from the limelight
Came to make a robbery, paper house and
[Refrain]
The curtain of darkness falls on you
Eyes Wide Shut
My masks are staged
I don't want to go in search of myself
Because I risk finding myself for real
Eyes Wide Shut
My masks are staged

[Verse 2]
I put the mask but I will not lose my face
Plastic mustache, I pretend to read the Pravda
I go for a ride among the people of the square
They are all V with the phrases after the hashtag
How many militants all day, a thousand causes, processions
Yes, but sometimes they were boring
I replied: "Okay", but I thought: "I would like
Hockey mask like Jason Voorhees "
I in the forest type fairy tale of Perrault
Teeth that beat wooden nacket
Someone calls me, lengthen the pace and I don't stop
How I was my twin with the iron mask
Hiding the face was destiny as Victor von Doom
I with a clean face no longer
Without the mask notes no one will save gotham
A myth is needed, not bruce
You Might Also Like [refrain]
The curtain of darkness falls on you
Eyes Wide Shut
My masks are staged
I don't want to go in search of myself
Because I risk finding myself for real
Eyes Wide Shut
My masks are staged
Eyes Wide Shut

[Bridge]
Do not praise sincerity
Because it is not a merit, it is a means
Heroes of superficiality
I would like to feel more often
I see you there placed there
Straightforward and pathetic like the approached
But my mask does not take it off
Or he will leave me without face
Like Miyazaki's spectrum
What is a man without, without a show on stage?
You think, think: it does not give me joy, nor punishment, I don't care
Better a lie that is at least creative
If you want the truth, it is nothing more than this
How can you tell me not to pretend if the choice of pretending is a real need?
If age also changes my face with a theatrical blow?
If you remove art from my world, it's just a trivial place, remember:
"Art is beter Than life"
[Outro]
Art is beter than life
Art is beter than life
Art is beter than life
Art is beter than life4embed
