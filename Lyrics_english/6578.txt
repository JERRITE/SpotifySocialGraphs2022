Unleash the Power Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Tinnesz]
Lightning from the sky
It runs inside our veins
Full speed till we fly
That's the only way, hey

[Refrain: Sam Tinnesz]
We're making waves
I think we're starting something
Broke out the cage
Can you feel it coming?
We're making waves
I think we're starting something
I think we're starting something
I think we're starting something
[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tinnesz & Rayelle]
(oh, woah)
'Bout to go down
Goin' all out
This is right now, yeah
(oh, woah)
Together we rise
It's about time
Unleash the power

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz]
Yeah, unleash the power
Yeah, unleash thе, unleash the power
Yеah, unleash the power
Yeah, unleash the, unleash the power

[Verse 2: Rayelle]
In a league of our own
The fire never fades
Still breaking the mold
No matter what it takes

[Refrain: Rayelle]
We're making waves
I think we're starting something
Broke out the cage
Can you feel it coming?
We're making waves
I think we're starting something
I think we're starting something
I think we're starting something
