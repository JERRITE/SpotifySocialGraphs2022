Starstrukk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go (Whistling)
That’s the way they all come through like (Whistling)
Low cut, see-through shirts that make ya (Whistling)
That’s the way she come through like (Whistling)

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
[Chorus]
I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints on it
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How
Do I say I’m sorry
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word
I never learned to pronounce

[Verse 2]
Tight jeans, double Ds makin’ me go (Whistling)
All the people on the street know (Whistling)
Iced out, lit up make the kids go (Whistling)
All the people on the street know (Whistling)

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
You might also like[Chorus]
I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints on it
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How
Do I say I’m sorry
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word
I never learned to pronounce

[Bridge]
Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I’m ready to blow
Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know
Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I’m ready to blow
Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know

[Chorus]
I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints on it
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word
I never learned to pronounce3Embed
