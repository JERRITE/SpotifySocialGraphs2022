Lyrics County ["County" letter]]

[Enter: Chris Jedi]
It was fixed, it was not left
He dressed a whore, he didn't care
He texts me that he wants to see me, eh-eh

[Chorus: Lunay & Young Miko]
She likes to janguear for a county
Give the phillie 'with crystall' down
What she does leave him private
And if the note goes up, today I fit it
Her choir does not lower her
Chiquitita with a new booty 'e box
Independent, nothing is missing
Break the disco almost toa 'Las Smina'
She likes to janguear for a county
Darsе the phillie 'with crystall' down
What she does leave him private
And if the note goes up, today I fit it
Her choir does not lower her
To'a ricota with a new cash flow
Independent, nothing is missing (aha, ah)
Break the disco almost toa 'the week' (prr)
[Verse 1: Young miko]
Baby, she and 'a geek-frik-frikitonga
Phillie 'in the wallet and in the car the bonga (mmm)
That you look for it in the Foreign (What), Pa'l Cajo el Honda
I gave the .9 mili pa 'to hide it (prr)
A Tour by County, ask me in Serafina
The powders are infiniti as in the pool, ah (uh)
In her bio she has almost no info
It ends' and turns on, already goes for the fifth (ajá), prr
You leave me with wins', pending my cell
He leaves in the morning and calls for nothing
Baby, you indicate that I arrive
Waiting for you, ma, I leave my ego
Ere 'difficult and I like that
You know what it does ', ma, you ere' unfair
Spicy mommy, she uses me
And I don't complain, I let it flow

[Chorus: Young Miko & Lunay]
Her corillo does not go down
Comes with a new flow 'e box
Independent, nothing is missing
Break the disco almost toa 'the week'
She likes to janguear for a county
Give the phillie 'with crystall' down
What she does leave him private
And if the note goes up, today I fit it
Her choir does not lower her
To'a ricota with a new flow 'e box
Independent, nothing is missing
Break the disco almost toa 'the week'

A perreíto at the Amazonian
Pog me the mahón, that tonight I vo'a do something historical
Left the toxic cat
Rulay is with Toa 'the besties and just wants to spend a bastard
If there is no mari, there is hookah
If there is no Don Julio, do not drink (yes)
Santa until the Jud arrives'
It has a pair of satellite 'in the Rede'
And they wonder how the ticke 'rains
'Tá in to' the After Party in the Vander (OKEY)
Now he lives without a asshole sending it (no, no)
It is the same walk with whom I walk
It has a couple of friend 'that among themselves' are launched
To'-to'-to 'the After party in the vander
Now he lives without a asshole to send it (hahahaha)
It is the same walk with whom I walk
It has a couple of friend 'that among themselves' are lambn (Lu-Lu)

[Chorus: Young Miko & Lunay]
She likes to janguear for a county
Give the phillie 'with crystall' down
What she does leave him private
And if the note goes up, today I fit it
Her choir does not lower her
Chiquitita with a new booty 'e box
Independent, nothing is missing
Break the disco almost toa 'the week'
