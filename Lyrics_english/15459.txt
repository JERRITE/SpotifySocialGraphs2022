Lost heart Lyrics [intro]
Lost heart
Lost heart
Lost heart

[Verse 1]
It was your voice a warm rumor
If things did not march
It was enough to hear your words
(It was enough to hear, it was enough to hear)
I am wrong about missing
The sweet fairy tale
And I always cry for nothing
(And I always cry for nothing)
[Chorus]
It was in the penultimate coffee
While we were talking about love
Or in that kiss on the platform
That I left my heart, my heart

It was on a bird flight
Or in phosphorescent light
Of your blue eyes
That I left my heart, my lost heart

I MISS YOU i miss you
You took my goodbye my goodbye
I MISS YOU i miss you
You took your goodbye ...

[Verse 2]
I remember every sunset
He gave us stars
Life was perfect
(Life was, life was)
I am wrong about missing
YOUR LIPS COLOR
It hurts even if I didn't want to
(It hurts even if I didn't want to)

It was in the penultimate coffee
While we were talking about love
Or in that kiss on the platform
That I left my heart, my heart

It was on a bird flight
Or in phosphorescent light
Of your blue eyes
That I left my heart, my lost heart

I MISS YOU i miss you
You took my goodbye my goodbye
I MISS YOU i miss you
You took your goodbye ...

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
It was on a bird flight
Or in phosphorescent light
Of your blue eyes
That I left my heart, my heart

It was in the penultimate coffee
While we were talking about love
Or in that kiss on the platform
That I left my heart, my heart
It was on a bird flight
Or in phosphorescent light
Of your blueberry eyes ... 1embed
