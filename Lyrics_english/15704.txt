I will worship you lyrics ["I will worship you"]

[Verse 1]
If this love were possible
And silence was a tangible body
If the end were the beginning for me
If this love was impossible
A desire, an intangible delirium
I would live in the routine of living

[Pre-car]
Yes for me
Loving you will cost me everything
And for you
Loving me welcome anything
[Chorus]
I will worship you
Although fate does not want it
Even if you get on the planet
I give you the same my whole life

I will worship you
If we share every day
I am the man of your life
Or by feeling it in my fantasies

[Verse 2]
If love is not the remedy
So that the heart is in the chest
So that roses and garden exist

[Pre-car]
Yes for me
Loving you will cost me everything
And for you
Loving me welcome anything

[Chorus]
I will worship you
Although fate does not want it
Even if you get on the planet
I give you the same my whole life
You Might Also Likete I will worship
If we share every day
I am the man of your life
Or by feeling it in my fantasies

[Outro]
If this love were possible
And silence was a tangible body
If the end were the beginning for membed
