Pls Donâ€™t Cry Lyrics[Intro]
I'm going to get married today
The chapel is full of flowers and sage

[Verse]
You say that you love me
I know you don't love me
I think about end it all, we in hell
They put us in this lil' game just to fail
Open your mind 'cause you stuck in a shell
Yeah my whole life is a muhfuckin fail
But what is a fail? Defined it by your tale
If I kill people, do I go to hell?
What is life? Man, I feel like I'm in jail
What is hell? I don't believe in that tale
I question everything if it ain't real
Rip my heart out, the plainness, that's tragic
Catholic school really ain't teaching you magic
Stabbed me in my back because they is stagnant, uh
Because they is stagnant, yeah
[Outro]
He'll lift up my veil and he will say
"Are you sure that you love me?
Are you sure you can wait?"You might also like1Embed
