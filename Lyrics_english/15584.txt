Snathea, turning in the jeepeta (in the jeepeta)

[Verse 1: Anuel AA & Juanka]
Baby, life is just one (Yeh)

Baby, the rain and I walked 'looking for you (looking)
With the same 'intention', pa 'that wets to you' (pa 'what wet')
And the one that does not chiche, she will have her reason '(Razone')

And I bought an 'air force, or footlocker the' has
In your pocket a paca 'of Ciene'
She sees the jeepeta and I swear that it comes
Looking for another jevito does not suit him
I amount to 4x4 and I imagine it in four
More than 24, in sex a baccalaureate, Yoh
If he says he does not smoke and 'a theater
It touches and sends me the portrait '

[Verse 3: brray]
MA-MA-Machinando in the troca
The Cuban that to anyone blur
Like a demon that gets off the rock
Where is it taking it out and placed it
It was big, that attaches' it bounces
Even in the seat I twerkea in the note
A turge in the turbodiesel on the coast
PHILLIE 'and PA' LA MUNCHIE 'Lobster
Bonnie and Clyde, Preventive the Ride
In the cloud hesitating for the Sky
Beautiful High, as a high couple
I just look 'know' what is there
My mommy the chamba if someone borders us
Avoid problem ', the thing' are ugly '
Today is not 'Pa' Revoluze ', so Pichea
Crystalloe 'down Pa' that they see me, Sheesh
[Chorus: Anuel AA]
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta, Yeh (in the jeepeta, Yeh)
With me a blonde, he has great 'Las Teta' (Grande 'Las Teta', h)
Wants me to put it in

[Verse 4: Myke Towers]
Yeh, snatched back in the G-Wagon
If you want 'I do it inside you
She and I do not know 'nothing but we celamo'
No stop ', you know' what I wathe '
It is so rich that it deserves a bus of the year
I've been in an air force one to 'the day
He says he waits for me 'Esnúa at the San Juan Hotel, Ey
I want to enjoy that delicacy
It is seen that ere 'de la' that a weekly jangel
You know 'my flow, my life and' a movie
He says it is natural, but for me that the booty was made
The boyfriend or that is surfer Mentra 'He is in the Buggy
I on top of her giving table, ma ', you ere' my blonde
You ere 'mine and's now, I'm going to get married as Nicky Jam
Who am I always want to investigate
I take a billion and change the identity
Myke Towers, Baby

[Verse 5: Juaka]
JUANKA (HAHA)
Livesto 'of the hybrid
He has a daring face, but without alcohol he is shy
And as if na 'sticks and shows its ability'
And leaves them Chocá 'like the gloves' of Trinidad
Uh, and none arrives
It never refuses, it does not take off
The block gives it to me
She is not to lose, she got used to winning
I try to fall, but you are 'the end and get tangled up
But proceed; What he asks for, Mommy, I grant you
Complete made in Cali, shoe 'Roberto Cavalli
He doesn't like Molly or Pali
And I know that perhaps or maybe they rise from tre '
I threw and connected, my diamond shines'
And you like that and runs you, smoking until your mind is erased, uh

[Chorus: Nio García]
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta (turning in the jeepeta)
I have a blonde who has a great 'Las Teta' (big 'Las Teta')
He wants me to put it (Yah-Yah)
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta (return in the jeepeta)
With me a blonde, he has great 'Las Teta' (Grande 'Las Teta')
Wants me to put it in
Snathea, turning in the jeepeta

[Outro: Anuel AA, Nio García & Myke Towers]

Some garment 'that change my attitude'
Tonight does not want 'revolú
(Snatch, turning in the jeepeta)

Gender is not about that (he wants me to put it in)
