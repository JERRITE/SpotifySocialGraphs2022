Go Get It (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Didn't even cry

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
She want Chanel, she want a Birkin
She wanna ride in the Rolls with the curtains
She want that brand new Balenciaga
She want that Gucci, that Louis, that Prada
(That Gucci, Louis, that Prada)
She want them big trips out the city
But that nigga was broke, so he wasn't with it
(Oh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah)
And she know I got the bag on me
And I like to spoil her, whatever she want (Yeah)
[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Shawty in college, no mileage
And plus she work a 9 to 5 (Mm-hmm)
She want a nigga to eat it
And beat it up like it's 1999 (Mm-hmm)
She know a young nigga pull up when she need it
You got it bad, girl, and I mean it (Got it bad)
Put you some double G's on your feet
Don't none of that shit compare to your physique (Oh, no)
You know I got time, let's do it
I'm with all the vibes, you knew it (Aw, yeah)
Your ex nigga must be crazy
Couldn't see a bad bitch even with Lasik (Ooh)
She got a face, no waist
But the case is that booty galore
She wanna taste a new place with the Wraith
And the Christian Dior, ooh (Yeah)
Young rich nigga vibes
I ain't with them bitch niggas, lie
Pussy worth six figures, slide
I'ma put this real in your life (Ooh, yeah)
Let a young nigga blow your back out
Down on all fours when you tap out
She know a young nigga bring the cash out
Good love on that money make you pass out
