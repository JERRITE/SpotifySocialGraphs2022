Nicely Done Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've got our thoughts perfecting words that you are soon to hear (Soon to hear)
With a brighter tone for elders, yeah, we'll make this sound sincere
Even when we're after trouble, we can be considerate
With a conscience for each other, all around we benefit

[Pre-Chorus]
Begging to help you quit, wouldn't your mom insist
A painless way to solve indifference?

[Chorus]
Everyone's confound to make it in this town
By taping up their frowns with new behavior
Make all of the sound you want, no one's around
Our friends are coming down, it's all familiar
[Verse 2]
We speak a language no one's heard and use a Mayan calendar
Our method's undiscovered and this township's still preserved
We wonder once our cover's blown if all our work will spill
Through reservoirs and jungles from Lawrence to Brazil

[Pre-Chorus]
Begging to help you quit, wouldn't your mom insist
It's time you compensate for what you missed?

[Chorus]
Everyone's confound to make it in this town
By taping up their frowns with new behavior
Make all of the sound you want, no one's around
Our friends are coming down, it's all familiar

[Bridge]
There's things in life I'll never know
There's things I'll never show

[Pre-Chorus]
Begging to help you quit, wouldn't your mom insist?
It's time you compensate for what you missed
And begging to help you quit, wouldn't your mom insist?
It's time to compensate for whatâ€” you've gotta compensate for what you missed
You might also like[Chorus]
Everyone's confound to make it in this town
By taping up their frowns with new behavior
Make all of the sound you want, no one's around
Our friends are coming down, it's all familiar

[Outro]
Everyone's confound to make it in this town
Start taking off your crowns, it's too familiar
(It's too familiar)
(Too familiar)
(Too familiar)
You're too familiar
(Too familiar)
(Too familiar)
(Too familiar)
(Too familiar)1Embed
