You want 'action, but he doesn't challenge you
For your addiction, I have the recipe
Tell me how much do I have to wait
So that you are complete
I know that you always bland us' (haha)
For me who realized the nebuleo (bad)
He has those who send, I have those who give
Tell him to leave the eagerness, that you only ere 'my fan
