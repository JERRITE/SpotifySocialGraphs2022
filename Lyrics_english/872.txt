There is no one more lyrics [letter of "there is no one else"]

[Verse 1]
I remember that day as if it were today
There is nothing like her, I didn't even find me
I still remember the time I kissed her
It was my first love, and now I write his song

[Pre-car]
There is something more inexplicable like your gaze
Unparalleled as the way he cela
And try to hide that it is not bad
[Chorus]
I'm going to take care of you at night
I'm going to love you without reproaches
I'm going to miss you in storm
And although there are a thousand reasons to give up
There is no one else
There is no one else

[Verse 2]
He took everything, he got sadness
There is no space for melancholy
Because next to him he is more right
I took their tears, laughs came
When we are together the earth is paralyzed, it is paralyzed

[Pre-car]
There is something more inexplicable like your gaze
Unparalleled as the way he cela
And try to hide that it is not bad

[Chorus]
I'm going to take care of you at night
I'm going to love you without reproaches
I'm going to miss you in storm
And although there are a thousand reasons to give up
I'm going to take care of you at night
I'm going to love you without reproaches
I'm going to miss you in solitude
And although there are a thousand reasons to finish
There is no one else
There is no one else
I do not want anyone else
There is no one else
There is nobodyyou might also like1embed
