I guess you know Lyrics [lyrics of "I suppose you know"]

[Verse 1: Ashley Grace]
You always said and did the right
You looked like the perfect man
I won me as a gentleman
And you know

[Verse 2: Ashley Grace]
Months passed, I got to know you
The emotion was decreasing
The details disappearing
And you know
[Pre-Car 1: Hanna Nicole]
I did dinner and you didn't arrive
All your excuses I bought them
The first five times I believed you
What do you want you to think about you?

[Chorus 1: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
I shouldn't give you what to do
You fell me in love and did it very well
I have tried everything, but it is impossible
Understand that I can't
And if you knew how to conquer my heart
Today that is all yours come and take care of it
In spite of everything I am here
I guess you know

[Verse 3: Hanna Nicole]
Then you swore that you were going to change
That your selfishness was left behind
Excited, I was waiting for you
And you know

[Pre-Boro 2: Ashley Grace]
I kept dinners and you didn't arrive
Now your excuses or listened to them
The second twenty times I gave up
And you still ask me to trust you
You Might Also Like [Chorus 2: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
I don't know what I do here waiting for you
I love you, but everything has a limit
I gave you more than anyone has given him
Much, much more, maybe it was too much
Little by little my suitcases I packed
Waiting for me: "Stay"
You didn't realize what I lacked
It will miss your bed and you know it

[Chorus 3: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
And there is nothing else that you can do
You hurt me and you did very well
Even if you try everything, nothing is possible
Understand that today I can
If you knew how to abandon my heart
Today that is already alone, just leave it
That after so much I finally leave
I guess you know

[Outro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
Because of you I have met someone else
Someone who gives me his life and gives me peace
And you don't know that
