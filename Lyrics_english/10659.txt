Ass For Days Lyrics[Intro: Project Pat & Juicy J]
Hoes in the club, man, shakin' and shakin'
Hoes in the club, man, shakin' and shakin' (Yeah, man)
Hoes in the club, man, shakin' and shakin' (Yeah, she bad, man)
Tricks showin' love man, bring home the bacon (She bad, man, on God, you better know)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I brought out the bag, give you somethin' to clap about
Ass so big, pin it down, got her tappin' out
She look at that ass in the mirror 'fore she came out
Biker shorts, all you see is fat, ma, hangin' out
Real thick, she put the pole between them cheeks (Woo)
Ratchet in public, nympho in the sheets (Nympho)
She know how to throw that motherfucker across street (Street)
She don't ride dick on her knees, she on her feet (Woah)
[Chorus: Juicy J]
Shawty got ass for days (Days, days)
And she goin' both ways (Both ways, like that)
You should see her on the stage (Stage, she bad)
Shawty really gettin' paid (Cash, crypto)
Shawty got ass for days (For days, for days)
And she goin' both ways (Hey, hey)
You should see her on the stage (Stage, stage)
Shawty really gettin' paid (Cash, crypto)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Thick bitch, she wanna fuck with a skinny nigga (Skinny nigga)
I don't pay for shit, but I'm rich, so I tip her (So I tip her)
Walk inside the club and I get love from all the strippers
Sent the bitch out the country, came back, her ass bigger (Ass bigger)
Poppin' that pussy, she always posin' in the mirror (In the mirror)
Left that lame nigga, she wanna come fuck with a real one (With a real one)
Three in the morning, she hit my phone up, sendin' pictures
Straight to the back and I bend her over and I hit her

[Chorus: Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa]
Shawty got ass for days (Yeah, days, days)
And she goin' both ways (Yup, both ways, nigga)
You should see her on the stage (Stage, stage)
Shawty really gettin' paid, let's go (Cash, crypto)
Shawty got ass for days (For days, for days)
And she goin' both ways (I like it)
You should see her on the stage (Stage, I like it)
Shawty really gettin' paid (Cash, crypto)
