Drop to Zero LyricsDrop to Zero, Drop
(it's happening again)
I feel boxed in, (it's happening again)
I'm trapped inside, (it's happening again)
Feels like the world's closing in (it's happening again)
And there's nowhere to hide

This time nothing feels right to me
I'm sinking deeper within
I'll wait for you to lose sight of me
Before I suffer again
(it's happening again)
I feel strapped down, (it's happening again)
While you feed the disease, (it's happening again)
I'm lying face on the ground (it's happening again)
For the whole world to see

This time nothing feels right to me
I'm sinking deeper within
I'll wait for you to lose sight of me
Before I suffer again

Drop, Drop, Drop to Zero, Drop, Drop
Now I'm so far away
This time nothing feels right to me
I'm sinking deeper within
I'll wait for you to lose sight of me
Before I suffer again
Now I'm so far away
Now I'm so far away
Now I'm so far awayYou might also likeEmbed
