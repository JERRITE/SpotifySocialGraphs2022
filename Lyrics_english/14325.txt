Right in Front of Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me more about the man that can't feel a thing
The one with the nice big house,  the car, the wedding ring
Everyone has an itch they cannot scratch
A feeling that can't be moved by the clothes upon your back

[Chorus]
I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
Shadows cloud my train of thought
What's the point if I'm not having the fun I should be?
Where am I fallin' short?
[Verse 2]
Tell me more about what you want and what you need
'Cause there's a difference and love don't come with greed
A rose decays
No ambition like a politician and
We don't deserve to fight before we feed

[Chorus]
I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
Shadows cloud my train of thought
What's the point if I'm not having the fun I should be?
Where am I fallin' short?

I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
Shadows cloud my train of thought
What's the point if I'm not having the fun I should be?
Where am I fallin' short?

I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
I'll believe in what's put right in front of me
I'll believe in what's put right in front of meYou might also likeEmbed
