Elaine Lyricshe came to think
Here in the background there is no way to see back
I look up and I know
Following this light I will not live

Something does not go well
I have realized there is nothing more to lose
He who life will not risk
He doesn't know how much it really is

I slow down
I run out of time
Listen oh oh ohh ohh
Oh oh ohh ohh
I'm still
The same in silence
Oh ohh ohh shout
Oh oh ohh ohh

Let me escape
For this time I want to feel that you will not return
Although MÐµ invades the cold does not suggest me
Stay a second more

I can still breathe
I'm sure I'm still alive I can bet
I'm cold, don't let go
Stay a second more

I slow down
I run out of time
Listen oh oh ohh ohh
Oh oh ohh ohh

I'm still
The same in silence
Shout not ohh ohh
NO OH OHH OHH

I'm still the same in silence
Listen oh oh ohh ohh
Oh oh ohh uohh
You might also like to escape this time I want to feel that you will not return
Although the cold invades me, you don't let go

Let me escape, let me escape
Let me escape
Let me escape, let me escape
Let me escape

I slow down
Time is over
Listen oh oh ohh ohh
Oh oh ohh uohh

I'm still
The same in silence
Shout not ohhh ohh
NO OH OHH UOHHEMBED
