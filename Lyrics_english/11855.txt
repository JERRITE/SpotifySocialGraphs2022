Belt 10, Uo-Oh
PERFECT FROM HEAD TO THE FEET
How it moves, well well
The sexiest thing I've been able to see
(Lenny!)
She takes over the place
With that movement it makes me bad
I love seeing her
And he likes when I ask for more

More, give me more, I want more
Move Your Body, take more
More, give me more, I want more
Move Your Body, take more

Uoohh, (Banbarah) Ouuhh, (Banbarah) Yeah!
When I ask for more
Uoohh, (Banbarah) Ouuhh, (Banbarah) Yeah!
When I ask for more

I fell in love with you that day I met you
YOU ALSO LUCIAS FROM THE HEAD TO THE FEET
When you approached me and that is
I would like to kiss you, caress you, without knowing you
I give you my life, you asked "how I saw you"
Ah very well, if you want I want too
Teach you to fly, I'm going to fall in love
Come and get more, I want to kiss you
And the night with you

That rises rises, the temperature
That the night is good to make mischief
Sexual movement without sanity
On the edge of madness, it has me sick
She is my cure
You might also liked, more, give me more, I want more
Move Your Body, take more
More, give me more, I want more
Move Your Body, take more

Uoohh, (Banbarah) Ouuhh, (Banbarah) Yeah!
When I ask for more
Uoohh, (Banbarah) Ouuhh, (Banbarah) Yeah!
When I ask for more
