Vanilla (Stairwell Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Now I don't wanna be your enemy
But truly I ain't got the energy
To wait for somebody who'll never be
It never works, it never will
I need a cure for all this apathy
I'm spending way to long on Web MD
Not so sure it's good for me
But guess I feel a little nauseous
Think I should be cautious
[Pre-Chorus]
Because we go in circles
Pick me up, let me down
Whatever works for you
We kept it lukewarm
Oh, so vanilla
Ooh, that's just what we do

[Chorus]
And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is, I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun
Tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here it goes
I have my best nights without you

[Verse 2]
I'll make it easy for the both of us
Now everything's become so meaningless
We're perfectly comfortable in the worst way

[Pre-Chorus]
From time to time
A spark ignites between us
Whenever works for you
So dull and lifeless
Oh, so vanilla
Ooh, that's just what we do
You might also like[Chorus]
And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is, I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun
Tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here it goes
I have my best nights without you

[Bridge]
We go steady, we just get by
We coast until we hit a red light
Truth is that I have my best nights without you
Give me the same jokes
You messed up the punchline
A few notes so you do better next time
Here it goes, I have my best nights without you

[Chorus]
And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is, I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun
Tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here it goes
I have my best nights without you

[Outro]
And now it's like we go steady, we just get by
We coast until we hit a red light
Truth is that I have my best nights without you
Give me the same jokes, you messed up the punchline
A few notes so you do better next time
Here it goes, I have my best nights without you
Here it goes, I have my best nights without you1Embed
