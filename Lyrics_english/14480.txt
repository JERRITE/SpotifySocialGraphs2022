Repent Lyrics [lyrics by "Repentío" ft. JUICY BAE]

[Chorus: Aleesha]
I don't look at you anymore, Yeah (na ', na', na ', na')
And you are regretful around
Your friends say you can't even sleep
(Na ', Na', Na ', Na', Na ', Na')
That I don't look at you anymore, Yeah (na ', na', na ', na')
You are nobody's anymore
Before I left you, but I'm not like that
(Na ', Na', Na ', Na', Na ', Na')
[Verse 1: juicy bae]
I don't look at you more '
They say that I repent on the street now you go '
I don't call you or write you anymore, it doesn't matter where it is'
Lose time looking for another one who occupies my place
Baby, is that I am not going to you for you 'More
The account is filled and every time you alometa more '
I am condemning for you, I would let me catch
How do you try very hard in the end

[Verse 2: taichu]
Fuck that, i'ma pretty girl swag
Ladies on the track, you like more and more '
Now you are regretful, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah
Already 'toy in mine, I don't want to cross you
You are Fucked for Life
You want to kill that I don't look at you anymore

But no 'tá in my plug
And what I already gave you, nah
It is not nothing for me, nah

Yeah, I don't look for you
Things changed, you have been well confused
If I wanted something and you weren't
And now you are alone, seeing me from the stands', huh
Move, yes, move, on my side do not stay
You do not deserve my hours, nor 'de na'
I invited you, I expected, but it never came to him. '
And now it's your turn to see me with five more '
Nah, don't turn to you '
I'm in mine, stay there
Nah, I will not turn to you '(nah, I will not turn to you')
You are always talking, go, shut up already (na ', na', na ', na')

[Verse 4: Nicki Nicole]
It was my fault that you are 'what I never wanted
I spent a thousand night 'consolidating you
When you were to blame
Another sees we liar again, Boo
Salúd me, look for what I didn't mean
I apologized for something I never did
You always come back with your excuses matrice '
You are a child and I never knew how to see it like this
Tell me if there is something you want to tell me
Time has passed, and it is still like that
I don't forget what you made me feel
I don't love you, so go from here
[Chorus: Aleesha]
I don't look at you anymore, ey ​​(na ', na', na ', na')
And you are regretful around
Your friends say you can't even sleep
(Na ', Na', Na ', Na', Na ', Na')
That I don't look at you anymore (na ', na', na ', na')
You are nobody's anymore
Before I left you, but I'm not like that
(Na ', Na', Na ', Na', Na ', Na')
