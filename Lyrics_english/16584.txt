[Verse 1]
No cheesy pick up lines, ama be straight with it
Like whiskey on ice, am that cool with it
Wanna have another drink, or you just wanna kick it
No pressure and I know we've been hanging for a minute
Or maybe for a second
Who gives a damn about time at this point
Come a bit morе closer, while I light up this Joint
Just for the night, forgеt about it all
There ain't nth that's worth it, for you to be annoyed
There ain't a single thang, worth a teardrop of yours
Not even me, cuz your tears are much more worth
Girl, you're so precious and am luckiest to be yours
Pardon me, if that sounded too insecure
But I can't afford losing you
Not after I finally found you
Not after I was blessed with the person who knows my value
So let me cherish you, take you under my wing
Don't got a lot to offer, but you gotta know one thing
Am at my best by your side, am a king
With you by my side, I can conquer anything
For you I wanna be a better version of myself
And turn every single failure, into a win
You're my better half, you and no body else
All these other hoes before you ain't shit

[Hook]
Hey girl, let me holler at ya' for a minute
Hey girl, let me show you what you've been missin'
Living life without no limits
Bittersweet and I know it be pressin'
That smile of yours, what I wanna' elicit
You know I got you girl, I got the blueprint
Just for the night, let's forget about stressin'
And space out, until on yo' neck I be kissin'

[Verse 2]
Space out until on your neck I be kissin'
Go all the way up to you ear, now am hissin'
Give it a little nibble, a little lickin'
Wrap my arms around you, tell you, you the one I be missin'
Our lips lock and in lust, we be sinkin'
No more talkin', no more thinkin'
Hearts racin', bodies tremblin'
Temperature risin', it feels so sizzlin'
You lay on my chest and nth else matters
For you I done changed some of my habits
Before you I was astray, I was scattered
You and only you have brought it all together
I can still sense some fear in you though
A hesitation, you can't seem to let go
Testing me, as if it was a game show
Hope you find your answers soon, once and for all
