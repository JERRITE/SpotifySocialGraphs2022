All Systems Go LyricsDust to dust, ashes to ashes
Rookie of the year, every class
I'd have mastered
Sipping wine, walking lines
Like I'm still drunk
Age is just a number
I'ma always be number one
Or twenty-three like that guy
From Chicago
Live fast die young
Keep your eyes low
I keep my eyes on that prize
I'm gon' get it
Cuz I got a dream
And the sky's no limit
Baby get your money due
What you need is getting through
Keep it up, they'll eat it up
I'm trying to get this paper too
We walk around campus like we own it
You walk around campus like you're lonely
It's the deans list
What you think we are, nerds?
Looking at your groupies
I can really tell they all birds
And I don't bump uglys
I only bump biddies with super model titties
And that's a little shallow
I was just playing
I like 'em Kelly Brooke good
I'm just saying
Growing up I always knew
Something didn't fit with me
Look around you'll see it's true
Almost where I'm supposed to be
I'mma go
All my systems, all my systems are a go
I'mma go
All systems, all systems are a go
Growing up I always knew
Something didn't fit with me
Look around you'll see it's true
Almost where I'm supposed to be
I'mma go
All my systems, all my systems are a go
I'mma go
All systems, all systems are a go

On the other hand
See, I got this other plan;
In the next six months
I'mma obtain a hundred grand
This shit ain't over but for now
Yo we under them
I can see through
Who they all been
Tryna' beat it
Marketing schemes, autotuning
Call these similes
I'm going for infinity
They can't even sit with me
Who you know?
Cue these verses
And it ain't the right song
Don't believe the shit
Take a picture with a nikon
I'mma be an icon
Got your girl hissing on my
Python
Next one and I'm gone
Once I throw my Nikes on
Take this shit back
Yeah, I'm in the right zone
They can suck my dick
Oh! Is the mic on?
Thinking that I'm crazy
Gone swirling like a cyclone
Is anybody home, man
I think I see the lights on
See, homie, always knew
It would come to this
Just a matter of time, the world gon'
Bump our shit
You might also likeGrowing up I always knew
Something didn't fit with me
Look around you'll see it's true
Almost where I'm supposed to be
I'mma go
All my systems, all my systems are a go
I'mma go
All systems, all systems are a go

In the sky, with the big dipper
Big picture
Ghost, right me for these times
No Hillfigger
I'm in my own lane
Looking at my own things
I don't need a lot of shit
I just want my own ring
So I heat it up, no LeBron though
Your girl say she had enough
Needs a poncho
I've been getting shy now
Ever since I took this route
Now every college kid
Wanna try they luck and
Figure out
My plan, understand
I just follow what my guys say
I don't pray to Christ
A couple hail Mary's all day
I switch up now reverse
In the stage with no rehearse
Put my feet up, throw the weed up
I'm from Boston, no Adidas
Just these Nikes some ideas
Couple bitches couple cheers
We the rookies of the year
Got your girl up in the air
Dying old is what I fear
I'm too young to give a care
Middle finger in the air
Sing along if you care like
Growing up I always knew
Something didn't fit with me
Look around you'll see it's true
Almost where I'm supposed to be
I'mma go
All my systems, all my systems are a go
I'mma go
All systems, all systems are a go
Growing up I always knew
Something didn't fit with me
Look around you'll see it's true
Almost where I'm supposed to be
I'mma go
All my systems, all my systems are a go
I'mma go
All systems, all systems are a goEmbed
