They Donâ€™t Own Me LyricsIs it true what they say?
Nothing in life is free
Are you looking this way
Surely this can't be

I know that you
Ain't like the other ones
March to a different beat, babe
Banging a different drum

I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me
I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me
I ain't playing their games
I am nobody's fool
Yeah, I know how it feels
I broke those rules

Are you walking with me?
Or are you running with them?
Are you ever free?
Is this something that you understand?

I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me
I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me

They don't
They don't own me

Is it really that strange
To try and find some peace?
Is it so opaque
That you still can't see?

Them, right up above
I wonder what they can hear
I guess we all mess up, baby
Mmm, we're here, then disappear
You might also likeI think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me
I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me

I think I told you before that
They don't
They don't own me
I think I told you before, yeah
They don't
They don't own meEmbed
