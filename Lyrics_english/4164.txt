Lyrics holidays ["holiday letter"]

[Intro]
I seemed to see a beautiful kitten
Doublet!

I woke up
In the room of a foreign house (O'Neill!)
And I stumbled
With two heels and four bottles (Party, Party, Party)
I remember
The thing was good
And I found myself
In the sofa with a couple of brunettes
(Double U!)
[Pre-car]
What to keep working?
I keep celebrating
Thus life is lived better
Last night it was crazy
Tomorrow is another adventure
Maybe I forget today
What to keep working?
I keep celebrating
Thus life is lived better
Last night it was crazy
Tomorrow is another adventure
Maybe I forget today

[Chorus]
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
My friends just enough
And a beer swallow
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
I just want to let me know
If there is a party tonight

Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating
Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating
You Might Also Like [verse 1]
I got out of bed and the rumba calls me
Twenty -four seven in search of a lady
I forget the fame
And the drink spills
And I keep cooling and dancing until my feet become inflamed
I know you want to
I also want
I don't put, but I want to be the first
If you ask me for a kiss, I exaggerate it
You know the cowboy
The one who is with the Cuban and the hat

[Chorus]
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
My friends just enough
And a beer swallow
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
I just want them to let me know
If there is a party tonight

Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating
Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating
(Take it on, turn it on!)
[Verse 2]
Rumba, Vacilón and Tequila
My combo does not make rows
Baby, you walk with me, so calm
It fascinates me how you hesitate
Your body kills me
And how to complete batteries
(Turns on!)
This is a Latin party
To ’the world for the pool
Tell your friends that this never ends
Let's go for the corner
Mommy, you look divine
Fascinates me
Baby, teach me the routine

[Pre-car]
What to keep working?
I keep celebrating
Thus life is lived better
Last night it was crazy
Tomorrow is another adventure
Maybe I forget today
What to keep working?
I keep celebrating
Thus life is lived better
Last night it was crazy
Tomorrow is another adventure
Maybe I forget today

[Chorus]
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
My friends just enough
And a beer swallow
I don't need vacation
Nor headaches
I just want them to let me know
If there is a party tonight

Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating
Lero Lero Lai, Suding
Lero Lero Lai, guayando
Lero Lero Lai, perreating
Lero Lero Lai, hesitating3embed
