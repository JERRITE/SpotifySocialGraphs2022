​did too much Lyrics[Verse 1]
Didn't think that it would hit this hard
'Cause after all, wasn't I the one who asked for it?
Did I go too far?
Is it all in my head?
Or should I have instead put the effort in to make up?
Cause the fake love isn't seeming as fake now that it's gone
I say stuff tryna act tough

[Chorus]
But when I said it'd hurt
Didn't think it'd be for both of us
Maybe I'm the one who did too much
[Verse 2]
Didn't think that it would hit this hard
'Cause after all, I'm the one who started wanting out
But I'm still so far
Thought I left cause I'd end up being happier
But now I miss your calls
The ones I thought I wouldn't miss at all
Wish that I never said it went too far
'Cause now I see that it was all on me for never bringing it up

[Chorus]
Wish it was both of us
'Cause now I think I did too much
Yеah, when I said that it would hurt
No, I really didn't think that it'd be both of us
'Causе now I think I did too much

[Bridge]
Yeah
Maybe I'm the one who did you wrong
Maybe I shouldn't have lead you on
Maybe I would've been better off
Tryna figure it out instead of just giving it up
Maybe you deserved a better love
One who'd tell you when it felt so wrong (so wrong)
Make it easier to open up
Tryna figure it out instead of just giving it up
You might also like[Chorus]
Both of us
'Cause now I think I did too much
Both of us
Oh, maybe I'm the one who did too muchEmbed
