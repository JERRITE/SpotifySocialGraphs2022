Escape from the Abyss LyricsIts been a long day
I came a long way
Got sick and tired of running circles round my own brain
I'm feeling cautious feeling nauseous
Had to separate myself from the narcissist
Out of options I don’t need none
Everyday another blessing never reruns
I don’t need guns
I don’t need funds
I just take it to the cross when I need some
I been heaven sent spirit benevolent
Demon slayer crosshair in the deficit
Define a terrorist my vision perilous
I look around see the blind climbing everest
I'm sick of all the spellcraft
Sick of how we live
Sick of all the timе spent wishing I was dead
Had to get my mind right
Looking back in hindsight
Nеver really cared about the fame or the limelight
I ain't tryna tell u how to live I tell it how it is
Ponder bout my past when I think about the kids
Praying for tomorrow what you get is what you give
I'm just waiting on the rapture to escape from the abyss
Now I'm just waiting on the rapture to escape from the abyssYou might also likeEmbed
