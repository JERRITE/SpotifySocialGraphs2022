BORN OUT THE PIT Lyrics[VERSE: CAMERON AZI ]
Bring the beef
Where the war
Yea we runnin it
Strapped up
Keep it tuck
Can't be fumblin
I can't fuck with niggas
Cause they be mumblin
Fuck you
Fuck this
Ain't no talking shit
{ CHORUS :CAMERON AZI}
BORN OUT THE PIT
GOD CANT TELL ME SHIT
BRING ME THE PAIN
MAKE ME FEEL ME MORE SANE

[VERSE: $UBJECTZ]
More hate More rage More death More pain
Insane yeah I'm saying I worship all these things
No hope no smoke I know
Back to the pits of hell burning we go
Watch me burn its okay
All the pain keeps the demons from haunting me
Drag me down to my grave
But you'll never kill my rage

{CHORUS: CAMERON AZI}
BORN OUT THE PIT
GOD CANT TELL ME SHIT
BRING ME THE PAIN
MAKE ME FEEL ME MORE SANE

[VERSE: CAMERON AZI]
I lose myself in all in my head
I fucking hate the life you live
I fucking hate you
I fucking hate you
