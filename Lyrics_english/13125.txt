Donâ€™t Think It Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
Leave your head
You're tryna to figure what she's thinkin'
It could be nothin'
Nothin' but a premonition
But it's hard to say you'll brush it off
That feelin' of losing her
Overweighs the facts
You gotta let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
No time for feelin' bad
Only adds weight to your mind
No sign of getting back
Loosen that grip on your pride
[Chorus]
She'll take her time
Making her mind
Sit back, don't think it over
You'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Still, you sweat
Over what she could be doing
It's a simple threat
Is it only the beginnin'?
Did you wake up late and take a bath
Won't write back until you ask
You don't know nothin'
You gotta let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
No time for feelin' bad
Only adds weight to your mind
No sign of getting back
Loosen that grip on your pride

[Chorus]
She'll take her time
Making her mind
Sit back, don't think it over
You'll be alright

[Chorus]
She'll take her time
Making her mind
Sit back, don't think it over
You'll be alright
You'll be alright12Embed
