TranslationEnglishantology Lyrics ["anthology" letter]]

[Verse]
To love you, I need a reason
And it is difficult to believe that there is no
One more than this love
There is so much within this heart
And although they say the years are wise
Pain still feels

[Pre-Car 1]
Because all the time that passes by you
He left his thread inside me
[Chorus 1]
And I learned to take away the second
You made me see the sky even deeper
Next to you I think I increased more than three kilos
With your many sweet kisses distributed
You developed my sense of smell
And it was for you that I learned to love cats
You take off my shoes cement
To escape both flying for a while

[Pre-Coro 2]
But you forgot an instruction
Because I still don't know how to live without your love

[Chorus 2]
And I discovered what a rose means
You taught me to say pious lies
To be able to see you at not appropriate hours
And to replace words with looks
And it was for you that I wrote more than 100 songs
And I even forgave your mistakes
And I met more than a thousand ways to kiss
And it was for you that I discovered what it is to love
The what is Love

[Outro]
The what is Love
The what is Love
The what is Love
The what is Love
The what is Love
