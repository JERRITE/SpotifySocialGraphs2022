I Feel Like Dancing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Call my name
I'll come running
A love so vain
It's black and white
See, my tie's undone
And I want you
A hired gun
On moonlit nights

[Pre-Chorus]
You look amazing
Every time we touch
And you say my name
It's something amazing
Feeling you so much
What a wicked game
(Someone call the band and say)
[Chorus]
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like moving
And I don't gotta make you mine for life
Baby, if you wanna lead, that's all right
Just don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight

[Verse 2]
You make me numb
You’re like, "Cowboy"
All good things come
To those who wait
I've been black and blue
Like a vampire
And I need you
To get me straight

[Pre-Chorus]
You look amazing
Evеry time we touch
And I feel your skin
It's something amazing
Just a midnight crush
But I'm sinkin' in
(I'm gonna call up thе band and say)
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like moving
And I don't gotta make you mine for life
Baby, if you wanna lead, that's all right
Just don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
You look amazing
Every time we touch
When you move like that and push back
(I'ma call in the band to play)

[Chorus]
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing
Don't stop the rhythm, rhythm (no)
'Cause I feel like moving
And I don't gotta lock you down for life
Baby, if you wanna leave, that's all right with me
Just don't stop the rhythm rhythm
'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
[Outro]
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
Baby, don't stop the rhythm rhythm
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
Don't stop the rhythm rhythm
I feel like dancing tonightEmbed
