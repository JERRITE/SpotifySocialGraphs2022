For Elise Lyrics[Intro]
When it's tough, when you get stuck
You're at the wall of the writer's block
You need a spark, a light in the dark
To get you out of your head and into your heart

[Verse 1]
Taking a walk on the wild side
Something in the way she moves
Candle in the wind and it's blowing everywhere we go
All these girls got something going on (Ooh woo ooh ooh ooh)
Met in the club, her name was Lola
Champagne-tasting Coca-Cola
In the hands of my love and oh, my love does her good
All us boys need something that they got
[Chorus]
This one's for Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started with a song
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) This one's for Elise
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 2]
The muses of the Greeks and Romans
Steal the immortal beloved of Beethoven
They all lit a spark and you know that they got it going
Shout out to the girl over there in my chair

[Chorus]
Whoa Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started with a song
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) This one's for Elise
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Piano Break]

[Chorus]
This one's for Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started
For Elise, Norma Jean
Pattie Boyd and Carole King
Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman
Candy Darling got it started with a song
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) This one's for Elise
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
