(Two years gone)
Woo!
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Oh, oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
[Verse 1]
Two years gone
Came back as some bones and so cynical
This skin don't feel like home
It's all overgrown, but you'll never know
I take the mirror from the wall so I can't see myself at all
Don't wanna see another damn inch of my skull
Forget the poems of saints and ghosts, I'm the one I fear the most
Little did I know that I was only crying wolf

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong, but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Woah-oh, woah-oh)

[Verse 2]
Push and pull, oh, it's all getting old
No, I didn't want this throne (No, I didn't want this), yeah
Only fools make feasts of gold
They rot the fruit on tables
No, I didn't want this throne
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When did I get so pitiful?
Just a goddamn corpse in a centerfold
You got my back against the wall
And now I can't ever get comfortable
No, I never sold my soul
If I ever do, throw my bones to the wolves
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong, but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical (Don't need you to tell me)
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
[Bridge]
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my soul
No, I never sold my—

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong, but I'm so far gone (I know it's so wrong)
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical (Don't need you to tell me)
Quit being so over-skeptical (I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't)
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
(Oh, oh, woah-oh)
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
