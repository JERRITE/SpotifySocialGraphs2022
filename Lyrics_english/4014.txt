I will love you (Remix) Lyrics [lyrics of "I will love you (remix)" ft. Milo & Román]

[Intro: DCS]
Your heart belongs to me and you don't know
I've been sending you the signals a long time ago
So you know that I love you here by my side (here by my side)
And that with me you will forget the whole past

[Pre-car: Roman]
It can be, in heaven
There is a star, shine
Like your eyes before dawn
(Hey, this is the remix)
[Chorus: DCS, Milo, Román]
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need to navigate between your skin curves
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need you to give me a few droplets from your honey
For not lose the horizon, I will love you from love
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need to navigate between your skin curves
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need you to give me a few droplets from your honey
For not losing the horizon, I will love you from love

[Verse 1: dcs]
OKEY
You don't need makeup
You had a good mommy, give it a softer chin
That I am not Maluma, to fall into your blackmail
But if I kiss my neck, I do the tattoo
Wild, there is no one who relaxes
Is more good than the Umbrella (Ela, Ela)
Blanquita with black ass
You are pa 'bathe in Nutella
And with a lot of love, give you a pela
And you will see that what I feel is real
There is no reason to hide not no no

It can be, in the
Sky there is a star
That shine like your eyes
Before dawn (before dawn)

[Chorus: DCS, Milo, Román]
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need to navigate between your skin curves
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need you to give me a few droplets from your honey
For not lose the horizon, I will love you from love

[Verse: Milo & Román, both]
Without fear mom see with me
Let's live the moment without witnesses
Is that I die for having something with you
Give it and follow my way
And give me a little kiss, give it not so bad (ah)
Crazy about having you close to me (Yeah)
Because my world revolves around you (as)
As much as you want and try to lie (Yeah)
You can't deny it, I know you want to feel (hey)
I think it's going to fall in love
See how your body moves
Makes you want to try (try)
[Pre-car: DCS]
It can be, in the
Sky there is a star
That shine like your eyes
Before dawn
Before dawn
Before dawn

[Chorus: DCS, Milo, Román]
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need to navigate between your skin curves
I need a crazy mouth kiss
I need you to give me a few droplets from your honey
For not losing the horizon, I will love you from love

[Outro: DCS, Milo, Román]
I will love you baby
