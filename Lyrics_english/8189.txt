One Night (Loneliness) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Gets real when the door shuts
Mix the sub with the bass up
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes that you're curious
Getting loose when the drinks, come
Don't matter where you came from
All that matters is that we're dancing 'til our feet gone numb

[Chorus]
Throw your hands, throw your hands, throw your hands on up
We'll be touching the stars
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on us
'Cause this moment is ours
Before you go make the lights stay up
Dancin' in the [?] of the crowd
[Pre-Drop]
'Cause this moment is ours

[Drop]

[Pre-Chorus]
Gets real when the door shuts
Mix the sub with the bass up
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes that you're curious
Getting loose when the drinks come
Don't matter where you came from
All that matters is that we're dancing 'til our feet gone numb

[Chorus]
Throw your hands, throw your hands, throw your hands on up
We'll be touching the stars
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on us
'Cause this moment is ours
Before you go make the lights stay off
Dancin' in the [?] of the crowd

[Pre-Drop]
'Cause this moment is ours
