Reaggression LyricsYou can see the blood in hand
The violence of modern man
The echoing of kicking can
The foiling of another plan
The writing that is on the wall
Says for a good time give a call
The teachers of your children small
Are not who they say, not at all

I can't take this anymore
I can't open up the door
Moving forward, giving thrust
Is not the only way for us
To win the battle, with the rust
Collecting on my brain
And there's a shadow on my future
Where success should ever lie
And there are way too many forks to know
Which path is really mine

I can't take this anymore
I can't end up on the floor (I can't, I can't end up on the floor)
I can't take this anymore
I can't open up the door (Looks like I lost my key)

It's a constant battle just to live and not to die
It's a dream to live without tomorrow in my mind
And I used to see my future standing over me at last
You can't open up tomorrow without closing down the past

Reaggression
Reaggression
Reaggression
Reaggression

Blackened eye, a bloody lip
Never abused, just a slip
The scars that tell a story are all talking once again
But I can see the knuckle bruises cross the center of your eye
There's a massive storm brewin', and yet safer than inside
You might also likeI can't take this anymore (Can't take this anymore)
I can't end up on the floor (I can't, I can't end up on the floor)
I can't take this anymore
I can't open up the door (Looks like I lost my key)Embed
