[Intro: Chencho Corleone]
Plan B is Plan B
Mommy, I can't take me
When I see you pass
When you dance 'in the tube
I get Loquito, I can't even talk
I give it to you all, Todita
You are the woman who excites me
You 'tá' good that a model 'e magazine
Get on the Lambo, which I bring you right now
]
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube

[Verse 1: the alpha]
Báilame in the tube, 'toy stealing for your ass
She doesn't put the 'pantie' pa 'fresco' in the ass
Too crazy, don't stop Nananina
When I get in 4, I put it fine
She 'tá to' the pod, seems Brazilian
Get on the tube, which vo'a gives' with firewood
The bangbros gave me a statuette
And the playboy wants to see me stilla
THE TIGUERÓN THAT DOES NOT LOVE
If I give you the time of my rolex, do you take away '?
THE TIGUERÓN THAT DOES NOT LOVE
I give you the time, do you not squeeze you '?

Ask me what you want ', I buy what you ask' (Yeih-eh)
What your boyfriend is more 'piktu' that I? Not 'daring (no)
Apparently, he uses a life uniform
The pole-shirt e 'a disease? Do not take away, like AIDS
Do not compare me 'with anyone, I am unique (Yeih-Yeh)
It bothers him because I grow fast, flower fleece (hol 'up)
The 'Barbie' Loca 'with Colorao
And I 'say: "soft", see that ass and come and go, like a manda'o
I 'like' banana ', but to me the tostón -ón
Soft machúcalo with this pylon
Pariguayo, for more 'that I fall out', I have no clone-clon (no)
I always win easy, bo ', never fuck
Báilame soft, soft, give it slow to see your millage (Hol 'Up)
Pa 'that the fence' the toll (let's get it) is linked to me)
Baby, don't you see 'that there is plenty of tigueraje?
I said: "I'm a trunk, to take that luggage"

[Chorus: Jon Z, the Alfa & Chencho Corleone]
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube

[Saying: the alpha, Chencho Corleone & El Alfa]
She tells me that she likes the 'banana' (Maduro ')
She tells me that she likes the 'banana' (Maduro ')
She tells me that she likes the 'banana' (soft)
Banana ', banana', banana ', banana'
Banana ', banana', banana ', banana'
Banana ', banana', banana ', plá' -plá' (soft)
Banana ', banana', banana ', banana'
Banana ', banana', banana ', plá' -plá'
Banana ', banana', banana ', banana'
Banana ', banana', banana ', banana' (soft)
[Verse 3: Jon Z]
Long live the chocha
Long live drugs ', live the whore', hoh, ey
Chinga like crazy
E 'a demon, that's my whore, oh, ey
Open the mouth
A little coca on my bug and sucks it, hoh, ey
With me it is slim
Blacky to the rock and began the rumba
E 'misfortune'o, Andamo' crazy
The screws of the coconut came out of me
I walk with the stick 'and the tomb coco'
Ra-Pla-Pla-Pla, I put you 'a little'
If it is 'pelua', mera, baby, I could
Do not come to party if it is' in period
You give your pot, walk with the elbow '
Mommy, if you peel ', I'm going to spread you iodine
And Chiguiri-Chiguiriban-Chiguiriban-Ban
Chiguiriban-Chiguiriban-Ban, if your cat e 'dates
Chiguiri-Chiguiriban-Chiguiriban-Ban, Chiguiriban-Chiguiriban-Ban
To dance the macarena, ouh (Jon Z, man)

[Verse 4: Noriel]
What do you want '? Wool, silver, room ', money? (AHA)
Ask me what you want ', but do me first
In bed, on the floor, in the tube, in the sky (Wuh)
My bug loves you, but I don't love you (ah)
Port well and present you a friend's pair '(Ajá)
Balenciaga, Gucci, Valentino
They are people who are always really with me
Not like the 'of your boyfriend who are Chinese' (no-no-no-no)
You don't ask how much it is worth
Give it to me, that it is mine, so that this shit works (wuh)
You snore me, but it's not worth
Because I live where you vacation '(ah)
Your cat always mentions me (no, no)
And you always forgive her '(no, no)
With me baby moët
And you are the most 'offer' are crown '(wuh)

[Choir: The Alfa, Chencho Corleone & El Alfa]
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube
I give you what you want, 'get me down in the soft tube

[Post-Coro: The Alfa & Chencho Corleone]
Smooth

[Verse 5: Bryant Myers]
Cloth in the tube, do you like hard or do you like soft?
In front and ass, in your mouth ejaculum
Baby, you know 'how do I
Ask what you want 'that I pay it
I start playing, and you form a lake
Bring me the bottle ', we don't buy drink'
Move that 'buttock' until the milk comes out
Move that 'buttock' until the milk comes out
Leave, leave, leave, go out
Go out, leave, leave, leave; May the milk come out
Leave, leave, leave, go out
Get out, leave, leave, leave, leave; May the milk come out

[Outro: The Alfa, the Alfa & Chencho Corleone]
