What You Mean To Me LyricsCan't blame you
For thinking that you never really knew me at all
I tried to deny you
But nothing ever made feel so wrong

I thought I was protecting you
From everything that I go through
But I know that we got lost along the way

Here I am with all my heart
I hope you understand
I know I let you down
But I'm never gonna make that mistake again
You brought me closer to who I really am
Come take my hand
I want the world to see what you mean to me
What you mean to me

Just know that I'm sorry
I never wanted to make you feel so small
Our story is just beginning
We'll let the truth break down these walls, oh yeah

And every time I think of you
I think of how you pushed me through
And showed me how much better I could be

Here I am with all my heart
I hope you understand
I know I let you down
But I'm never gonna make that mistake again

You brought me closer to who I really am
Come take my hand
I want the world to see what you mean to me
What you mean to me, yeah

You make me feel like I'm myself
Instead of being someone else
I wanna live that everyday
You might also likeYou say what no one else would say
You know exactly how to get to me
You know it's what I need
It's what I need, yeah

Here I am with all my heart
I hope you understand
(I hope you understand)
I know I let you down
But I'm never gonna make that mistake again
(That mistake again)

You brought me closer to who I really am
So come take my hand
I want the world to see what you mean to me
What you mean to me1Embed
