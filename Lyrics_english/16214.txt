Line By Line Lyrics[Verse 1: JP Saxe]
There are things that I sing
That I'd never have the confidence to say
There are things I believe
That I only figure out when I sit down to play
The truth don't scare me in a melody
Immortalizing my sincerity
There are things that I sing
That I'd never have the confidence to say

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe, JP Saxe & Maren Morris]
Like that song about my parents that I'll never show 'em
And the ones about my exes that they don't deserve
But when it comes to you
I'm still trying to find the words
[Chorus: JP Saxe & Maren Morris]
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up, I know I'd get it wrong
Sometimes if it don't sound right
I apologize, I just said it 'cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life
(Line by line by line by line by line) Line by line

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
There are things that I sing
That I'll never have the confidence to say
Like I'm still not convinced
That I won't be too much for you someday
Yeah, we both know the way it goes
Hear my fears all on the radio
There are things that I sing
That I'll never have the confidence to say

[Chorus: JP Saxe & Maren Morris, Maren Morris]
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up, I know I'd get it wrong
Sometimes if it don't sound right
I apologize, I just said it 'cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life
(Line by line by line by line by line) Line by line
I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life
(Line by line by line by line by line) Line by line
I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life

I know it's complicated having all your shit on display
I appreciate the way you make it work
When it comes to you
I'm still trying to find the words

[Chorus: JP Saxe & Maren Morris, JP Saxe]
Love too big for a love song
If I tried to sum it up, I know I'd get it wrong
Sometimes if it don't sound right
I apologize, I just said it 'cause it rhymed
Four chords, three minutes, you never fit in it
So I just take you line by line
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life
