Eternal Love Lyrics[Intro: Oritsé Williams]
We got that up and it ain’t finished, we’re in a eternal love

[Verse 1: Marvin Humes]
Welcome to your night
Favorite drink on ice
We can watch the sun go down under city lights
Talk about our life, people we don’t like
Nobody can judge our past, we’ll be alright

[Verse 2: Aston Merrygold]
Just the two of us
Baby, that’s enough
Everytime I look at you, girl, I feel a rush
Life can never be tough if we stay stuck
If we stay together 'til forever and a day, love
[Pre-Chorus: JLS]
I know we’re way up
Even if the sky falls today, I know we won’t break up
Cause I know that nothing they say will ever change us
You’ll always blow 'em away
No, you don’t care what they say
Cause you know you’re beautiful, ay

[Chorus: JLS]
And baby, there ain’t nothing wrong
With turning all the lights down low
Speakers poppin' playing our song
In my all-star shirt, underneath there’s nothing on, ay
And if you want to take it slow
You know that I’ll wait for you 'cause you have my soul
Wrapped up in between these sheets, ay
You’ve got my heart and I got what you need

[Refrain: JLS]
We got that love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal love
Love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal love

[Verse 3: JB Gill]
Welcome to your night
The city is alive
But nothing can compare to the moments here inside
Looking in your eyes, incredible sight
I just wanna capture it all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: JLS]
I know we’re way up
Even if the sky falls today, I know we won’t break up
Cause I know that nothing they say will ever change us
You’ll always blow 'em away
No, you don’t care what they say
Cause you know you’re beautiful, ay

[Chorus: JLS]
And baby, there ain’t nothing wrong
With turning all the lights down low
Speakers poppin' playing our song
In my all-star shirt, underneath there’s nothing on, ay
And if you want to take it slow
You know that I’ll wait for you cause you have my soul
Wrapped up in between these sheets, ay
You’ve got my heart and I got what you need

[Refrain: JLS]
We got that love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal love
Love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal love

[Pre-Chorus: Aston Merrygold]
I know we’re way up
Even if the sky falls today I know we won’t break up
Cause I know there’s nothing they say will ever change us
You’ll always blow 'em away
No, you don’t care what they say
Cause you know you’re beautiful, ay
[Chorus: JLS]
And baby, there ain’t nothing wrong
With turning all the lights down low
Speakers poppin' playing our song
In my all-star shirt, underneath there’s nothing on, ay
And if you want to take it slow
You know that I’ll wait for you cause you have my soul
Wrapped up in between these sheets, ay
You’ve got my heart and I got what you need
We got that love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal love
Love and it ain’t finished, we’re in an eternal loveEmbed
