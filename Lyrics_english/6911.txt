Looking for Lyricsteno what to tell you
That before you will arrive
Everything was ready to fall in love
The time I lost, the kisses I give away, were necessary to learn
That when I found you, I would know just looking at you, for the first time

Let me have the recipe for the rest of the dinners that we have left together
Leave me, the hours spend minutes between you and me

Looking for you I found
The source of happiness
The scene I don't want to stop living with you
Looking for you, have what I can't buy
And for your love I am alive
Na na na
Every day more alive
Na na na
Mike Bahia
Na na na
I feel that having known you is no accident
Na na na
And now that I have you I will not let you escape

Let me clarify at this time
That you were not anywhere different from this
Well, you came to see me
That's why you look radiant
That's why I'm elegant
I apologize I don't want to lose a moment with you
That's why

Let me have the recipe for the rest of the dinners that we have left together
Leave me, the hours spend minutes between you and me

Looking for you I found
The source of happiness
The scene I don't want to stop living with you
Looking for you, have what I can't buy
And for your love I am alive
You Might Also Likena Na Na
Every day more alive
Na na na
Mike Bahia
Na na na
I feel that having known you is no accident
Na na na
And now that I have you I will not let you escape

[Bridge]
You just need to touch you, you don't have to talk
There is nothing more to expect, the time of kiss came
And I slowly approached your lips, your hands don't stop shaking
I'm realizing my pretty girl who was worth waiting for you

Looking for you I found
The source of happiness
The scene I don't want to stop living with you
Looking for you, have what I can't buy
And for your love I am alive

Na na na
Let me introduce me I'm Mike Bahia
Na na na
Where were you so lost
Na na na
I feel that having known you is no accident
Na na na
And now that I have you I will not let you escape
