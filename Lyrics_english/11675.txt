2 / 14 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Second guess these words of mine
I always thought that I'd be fine with you
But ever since we crossed that line
Got your green eyes in the back of my mind, it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't be just friends
You're messin' with my head
And I know what I said, but
These feelings, they keep runnin' the red
[Chorus]
I got your heart on my mind and
You said that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got your face on my mind and
It was fun, runnin' around for a while
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight

[Verse 2]
Two steps forward, one step back
It won't be long 'fore my heart's attached (No)
And common sense falls second place
To the way it feels when you kiss my face (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't be just friends
You're messin' with my head
And I know what I said, but
These feelings, they keep runnin' the red

[Chorus]
I got your heart on my mind and
You said that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got your face on my mind and
It was fun, runnin' around for a while
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight

Oh, I can't fall in love tonight
Can't fall in love2Embed
