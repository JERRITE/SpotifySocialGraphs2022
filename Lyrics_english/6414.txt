New Invention Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got the devil on your shoulder
You better shut your mouth just like I told ya
You've been controlling me through fiction
It's obvious, I've got to break you like a bad addiction

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I can't say no
I'm losing control

[Chorus]
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the
Bad things away from me until I fall asleep
Bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
The girl is like an architect
And I am just a new invention
I am just a new invention
I am just a new invention
[Verse 2]
You've got to choose between your faces
Feels like you're running out of holy places
And now the room is getting quiet (Shh)
Oh, what a shame, nobody taught you how to read and riot

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, bless my soul
I'm losing control

[Chorus]
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the
Bad things away from me until I fall asleep
Bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
The girl is like an architect
And I am just a new invention
I am just a new invention
I am just a new invention

[Bridge]
It's a miracle I'm standing
You're dragging me back into having
(Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the
Bad things away from me until I fall asleep
Bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
The girl is like an architect
And I am just a new invention
I am just a new invention
(Bad dreams, bad dreams)
I am just a new invention
(I can't sleep, having bad dreams)
I am just a new invention
(I can't sleep, can't sleep)
I am just a new invention17Embed
