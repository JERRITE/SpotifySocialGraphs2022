Animal (Mark Ronson Remix) LyricsThere was a time when my world was filled
With darkness, darkness, darkness
Then I stopped dreaming now i supposed to fill
It up with something, something, something
In your I see the eyes of somebody knew before
Long, long, long ago
But im still trying to make my mind up
Am i free or am i tied up


I change shapes just to hide in this place but I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when i slip yeah i slip
I'm still an animal
There is a hole and i tried to fill up with money, money , money
But it gets bigger to your hopes is always

Running,running,running

In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody of who could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up are you free or are you tied up

I change shapes just to hide in this place but I'm still I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
I'm still an animal

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip, yeah I slip
I'm still an animal

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when i slip yeah i slip
I'm still an animalYou might also like1Embed
