Translationsenglishlil Baby & Lil Durk - Still Runnin (ft. Meek Mill) (Russian translation) Lyrics [LIL BABY & LIL DURK song translation (ft. Meek Mill) - “Still Runnin”]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
(Kj, what's going on? Come on, come on, come on, yes)
The back of the phantom to get a little head
Do you have purple? Then bring me red (yes, wow)
(Young Nick Papz, Make it SLAP)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ниггер знает, что я отступаю каждый раз, когда выходят, большой мальчик, выпрямись, нарушитель
I was in a damp house, relaxed with Mac Out, a gang, I and my Kents
Nigga, we do not use Sticks here, only Glicks with extension cords
Ниггер, не фотографируйся здесь, все на условно-досрочном освобождении, дерьмо чувствительное
I got a check, fell in love with him
I have a neck, for this
Money, respect, buy Cullinan
Come to a small quarter like an elephant
I have a small "glock" with a drum
We are those, they are those
Now forty -five hundred of my jacket, they say that I am too rich to be without belts, yes, oooo
The doors-self-down citizens on the phantom, it seems that you go backwards
Double platinum, this is a double murder when we glide, I just put a hit on rapper
You are secretly disinfect, then you will find out, God says to you, and tells you, "climb into the coffin"
Put the letters "M" and turn all the coefficients, we bring this shit to the maximum, yes
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
You must not be out of your mind, you think we are not spinning for your brother?
I had a switch, not 38 caliber, moron, guy, we are spinning for ghosts
They put a show, we twist the cribs and traps, we twist his show
And we received "l", but in Chicago they know that we win
You are doing this for what? Лучше не говори, что ты делаешь это для D-(Boom), их ниггеры будут подтянуты
Этому ниггеру пиздец, как только он побежал и понял, что ему не увернуться, его заднице не повезло
We do this for Vaughn, we do not wait until everything subsides, we are loading and doing it tomorrow
We do it on our feet, ask all the opponents about us, and who will say that we shoot cars
Лучше бы Rolls был пуленепробиваемым, ниггер, ты знаешь, что мы будем стрелять по звездам
These little bitch, I told him to fuck her and the whore and send her back to the blogs
Glock with a switch, two of these, and I'm going around the city
И мы думали, что ниггер умер, но он не умер
Two Glocks when you go through Philadelphia
Toning if you die in Philadelphia

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Everything that is close to Daba, and the young man will go for a hundred, he, damn it, almost got caught
If I send him a product, consider it bought
I decide, I'm a boss
I'm going with a semi -trailer
Two of them, I can't die in my city
We will arrange a shootout, it should not be beautiful
Let's catch it and deal with business
Я не влезаю в дела ниггеров
Thirty million, my mind is still in slums
Трахни ее хорошенько, пусть ее ниггер не заводит
They shot Brody on camera, he returns home
From scales to microphone
Treat Dior as Nike store
Do you know that he is not like that, why are you inflating him?
Any time we smoke, it's just Pipe Me Up
You never know the result until you try happiness
Get whatever you want when I'm trying to fuck
And we say that no one can fuck us
Put four in p with fucking f
I must never hurt my fucking "I"
If I ask for help, I will need it
I just know that I will explode if we are talking about life or death
I made all these whores drink and never left
I'm much higher, I'm on top
I was on the shallows, but woke up with the mood
Now you play with your child, he bothers you
I jump right in the field without a parachute and in one pair of boobyou might also Likemed
