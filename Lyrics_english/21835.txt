Lifeâ€™s What You Make It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it?

[Chorus]
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
[Verse 2]
Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, don't try to shade it
Beauty's naked

[Chorus]
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
What you make it

[Verse 3]
Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it, anticipate it
Yesterday's faded, nothing can change it
Life's what you make it

[Chorus]
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
(Everything's all right)
(Everything's all right)
Make it, make it
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make itYou might also like4Embed
