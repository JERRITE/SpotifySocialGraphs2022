Atlanta June Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come here baby, and sit down with me
I've got something on my mind I've just got to make you see
It's been working at my heart, for far too long
And ive to tell you how I feel
Casue I know I'll soon be gone

[Chorus]
Atlanta, Atlanta June
I'm leaving you and Georgia too
But someday, maybe I'll find a way, back to you
Atlanta June
[Verse 2]
Now I've been unlucky with love before
But the time weve spent together
Has got me one more
So for now, let's not think of us apart
Let's just keep this memory forever in each other's hearts

[Chorus]
Atlanta, Atlanta June
I'm leaving you and Georgia too
But someday, maybe I'll find a way, back to you
Atlanta June

[Bridge]
Atlanta
My Atlanta
I'm gonna miss you

[Chorus]
Atlanta, Atlanta June
I'm leaving you and Georgia too
But someday, maybe I'll find a way, back to you
Atlanta June
Oh Atlanta, Atlanta June
Atlanta, Atlanta June
Atlanta, Atlanta JuneYou might also likeEmbed
