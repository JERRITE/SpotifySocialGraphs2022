Business Casual Lyrics[Chorus: Coco O, Antwaun Stanley, Joey Dosik, Theo Katzman]
Let's keep it business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
A win-win history, oh oh oh
Business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
The win-win history, oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Coco O]
Good man gives the love you never got
But I want something Haimish, do it like the Danish
I can't change your feelings, but feelings they can change
Smart enough to understand the game, but don't see it don't mean a thing
[Chorus: Coco O, Antwaun Stanley, Joey Dosik, Theo Katzman]
Let's keep it business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
A win-win history, oh oh oh
Business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
The win-win history, oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Coco O]
I got my PhD, you'll be my disertation
I got my CPA, you'll be my signatory ohh
Steal from Steve Jobs
And quote from John Wooden
Because it's me and this wallpaper
And one of us has to go

[Chorus: Coco O, Antwaun Stanley, Joey Dosik, Theo Katzman]
Let's keep it business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
A win-win history, oh oh oh
Oh business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
The win-win history, oh oh oh

[Bridge: Coco O]
Love is like a big ski mountain
You hike all the way up and you fly right down
Everyone's talking about flying through the mountain
I just want to talk about hiking all the way up
You might also like[Chorus: Coco O, Antwaun Stanley, Joey Dosik, Theo Katzman]
Let's keep it business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
The win-win history, oh oh oh
Business, let's keep it casual
Let's keep it fun for you and me, so you can see
The win-win history, oh oh oh
