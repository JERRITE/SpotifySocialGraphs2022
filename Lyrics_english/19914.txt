Free Dizzi Slick Lyrics[Sample]
I sell dope, I don’t need you
I dont feed you, I can’t leave you
If I see another bitch, then I hope that you leave me
I dont give a fuck about my bitch, nah
Dizzi-fucking-Slick, I serve it raw

I sell dope, I don’t need you
I dont feed you, I can’t leave you
If I see another bitch, then I hope that you leave me
I dont give a fuck about my bitch, nah
Dizzi-fucking-Slick, I serve it raw
[Verse 1]
I can tell that bitch is lying
I got Gucci on my mind
Sold my lil nigga a 9'
These bitches get cut like a coupon
Home invasion, child who’s in saint’s row
Fuck a drive-by, niggas shootin' on a skateboard
Mackned gettin' money like a San Francisco hoe
Nigga runnin' from me, like he runnin' for mayor
Best decision I ever made was to quit pills
I got Horse Head in my will, yeah
I made it out the streets and kept my pride, yeah
We get shackled from the shoulders, we can fight, yeah

[Bridge]
Home invasion, child who’s in saint’s row
Fuck a drive-by, niggas shootin' on a skateboard
Gettin' money like a San Francisco hoe
Mackned, ooh la la
Bottom to the top, yeah

[Verse 2]
I might have a baby on the way, but who knows
I don’t trust a bitch until I see the belly shows
Cash rules every-damn-thing
I'ma fuck on that bitch, I'ma pull her wig, yeah-yeah
Cash rules every-damn-thing
I'ma fuck on that bitch, I'ma pull her wig, yeah-yeah
Cash rules every-damn-thing
I'ma fuck on that bitch, I'ma pull her wig, yeah-yeahYou might also likeEmbed
