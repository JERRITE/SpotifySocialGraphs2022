That we are lyrics [letter of "that we are" ft. Before one hundred and twenty, the fat s, Kaeve, Estani & Fmk]

[Enter: Big One & Fmk]
(This is the big one)
What happened to us?
If we loved each other
What happened to us?
Sometimes I think the feeling is over
And I know that little by little our love
My love is suffering wear
Sorry to ask you
[Chorus: g sony]
What are we?
That although we are together we feel alone
And even if we want we feel alone
And there is something that I can no longer avoid
It is to see you pass and ask:
What are we?
That although we are together we feel alone
And even if we want we feel alone
And there is something that I can no longer avoid
It is to see you pass

[Verse 1: before one hundred and twenty]
Baby, you are like Siri
You only answer the phone
When I look for you
Today you kiss me and tomorrow or look more at your two things
Love does not help me if it's about deceiving us
When everything is a trick, magic is lost
And we get used to not finding ourselves today
How do I be able to get you out of my mind?
If when I look at you I think

[Verse 2: g sony & fmk]
I feel so cold and distant
With so much that we had ahead
Today when you look at me
I no longer see the love that had previously had
When your skin bristled
How did anyone do it
Do you want or don't want to be my Lady?
Contact me at once
(FMK Baby)

What are we?
If we are together we feel alone
If although we want we feel alone
If there is something that I can no longer avoid
Is to see you pass and ask
What are we?
If we are together we feel alone
If although we want we feel alone
If there is something that I can no longer avoid
It is to see you pass

[Verse 3: Estani]
Is that nobody knows about loving
Seeing you unintentionally doesn't feel the same
Keep in mind and I am wrong
But I can't escape you
Don't forget
They don't know how to love
Seeing you unintentionally doesn't feel the same
Keep in mind and I am wrong
But I can't escape you
Don't forget, Yeh

[Verse 4: kaeve]
I know that my vice fuck you for the bottle
That walks drunk and tells you about her
I am always incorrigible leaving a mark
But I don't know another way
I will always be yours
I leave all the pride
I don't want to release you already
I don't want to leave you more '
Because I will always be yours
I leave all the pride
I don't want to release you already
I do not want to leave you
[Bridge: Before one hundred and twenty & Estani]
And how do I forget you?
If it was to see you around
All night
To 'what away from me
And I intended from you
It has not been worth it

And how do I forget you?
If it was to see you around
All night
To 'what away from me
And I intended from you
It has not been worth it

[Stew: Kaeve, G Sony & Fmk]
What are we?
If we are together we feel alone
If although we want we feel alone
If there is something that I can no longer avoid
Is to see you pass and ask
What are we?
If we are together we feel alone
If although we want we feel alone
If there is something that I can no longer avoid
It is to see you pass

[Outro: FMK, G Sony, Kaeve, Estani & Fight twenty]
Is The Big One, Yah
G Sony
Kaeve in music
Estani, Yeah
Faced with one hundred and twenty
FMK Baby
If there is something that I can no longer happen
It is to see you pass
