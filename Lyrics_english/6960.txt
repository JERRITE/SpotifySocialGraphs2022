Vacation Lyrics[Intro: Meechy Darko]
Vacay!
Vacay!
Vacay!

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't sweat her texts (No) my life is a test (Test, yeah)
Takes a little effort (Effort) makes a lot of stress (Uh huh, stress)
'Posed to be this way (Way) who could lead the way? (Way)
Them shades a couple K's (K's) we don't see the same (Uh-huh)
Do I need a name? (fame) Do we flee from fame (Name)
Now that's a cold case (Case) Hennessy the same (Same)
You're supposed to be the king (King) let me see your wings (Wings)
Spread the gospel goal (Goal) and let freedom ring
[Chorus: Zombie Juice]
I swear it's so amazin'
I swear it's so amazin'
Yeah, I feel like on vacation
They wanna be me, I ain't dead yet, no
You wanna ride, you need a spaceship
Ayy, baby, don't get impatient, no
Gotta hustle 'til you make it, Lord
Yeah, I swear it's so amazin'

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$ & Meechy Darko]
Badmon
Yeah, cruising in my own lane, had to take the scenic route
My reality is what most you niggas dream about (Stay lucid)
Fake niggas only ride for you when they need the clout (They leechin')
But leave your ass for dead when you’re bleedin' out (Drip, drip, drip)
Look, but blood thicker than water, that’s word to my daughter (Baby girl)
This year is where I had to draw up all of my borders (Great wall)
I’m bossed up, I used to take their orders, uh
They ain't wanna pay attention now they can’t afford us, yeah
I made a milli' in the first quarter on the hush, yeah
Plus this my Jordan year, bitch, I'm just warmin' up, yeah
I ain't in a rush, that's just my adrenaline flowin'
I drop the top just so they can see the melanin glowin'
Like fuck the cops, uh, posted on the block like Giannis
I promise, they call me Mr. Brooklyn’s Finest (No lie)
I'm feelin' like I'm Yeezy with the shutter shades
Can’t tell me nothing, in my stuntin' phase, wait 'til all them hunnids made
You might also like[Chorus: Zombie Juice]
I swear it's so amazin'
I swear it's so amazin'
Yeah, I feel like on vacation
They wanna be me, I ain't dead yet, no
You wanna ride, you need a spaceship
Ayy, baby, don't get impatient, no
Gotta hustle 'til you make it, Lord
Yeah, I swear it's so amazin'

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just got back from Australia (Woo)
Wildin' out, getting double mouth like an alien
Zombie Gang, Gang, Gang, can't say it once
Who wanna bang, bang, bang? I'm Pops Wayans' cuz
Got a blade on my tongue, dirty nine on my side
Ratchet from overseas, mail order bride
I'm the shit like my momma gave birth out her asshole
Ammunition wrapped around my body like Rambo
Shout out to my main chick, side chick and mistress (I love you bitches)
Same shit, love you girl, just handle yo' business (Woo)
Got blood on my Fendi joggers (Fuck), watch me mix-match designer (Fuck)
I just wanna spend 4/20 with Rihanna (If I had one wish)
Throw her over my shoulder then bring her back to my island
Then put her legs over my head like a Hurricanrana (Aha)
I'm prolly the realest nigga to climb out a vagina (Too real)
Now does that sound like a good vacation or am I wildin'? (Fuck yeah)
[Chorus: Zombie Juice]
I swear it's so amazin'
I swear it's so amazin'
Yeah, I feel like on vacation
They wanna be me, I ain't dead yet, no
You wanna ride, you need a spaceship
Ayy, baby, don't get impatient, no
Gotta hustle 'til you make it, Lord
Yeah, I swear it's so amazin'7Embed
