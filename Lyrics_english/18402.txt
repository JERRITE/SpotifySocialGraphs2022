Rose Gold Stripper Pole Lyrics[Intro]
(Rose gold stripper pole)
Ayy
Ooh (Island with the cash like Diego)
Ayy
Mmm, mmm, turn me up, turn me
Turn me up, ayy
(Bankroll Got It)

[Chorus]
He can eat the box, but I still tell him we don't label that
I should call him Weezy, he be tryna see where baby at
Bitches think they really sending shots, but it be laser tag
If he run into me, CPS, can't get your baby back
[Verse 1]
And no this ain't no "Panda," but we do stay in designer, ayy
My best friend in that Prada, you know I'm Balenciaga
I ain't crazy 'bout no nigga, I'm too crazy 'bout a dollar
And yes, I'm still a P, be selling dreams like marijuana, ayy
You can really ask about me, these nigga ain't smashin' me
I got pretty privilege, baby, these niggas ain't taxin' me
Be mad at your baby daddy, mami, don't be bashin' me
You got you a Bentley, nigga, you can't just be crashin' me

[Chorus]
He can eat the box, but I still tell him we don't label that
I should call him Weezy, he be tryna see where baby at
Bitches think they really sending shots, but it be laser tag
If he run into me, CPS, can't get your baby back

[Verse 2]
I can't be seen with no nigga, TLC, we gotta creep
I say I only fuck with ballers 'cause these ballers fuck with me
You know, you know I ain't in town, what you mean you tryna see me?
(Oh, you got me something?), I mean, where you tryna meet me?
The way I got the VVs dancing, you would think I'm at The Pynk
I don't think these bitches Cubans, why they think we gotta link?
If I wasn't smoking bitches, would've still been in they league
You know I been running shit, I'm the Sha'Carri of the streets
Ooh, the streets callin', put it on silent
Bitches call 'em husbands, I call 'em my clients
And they couldn't take my spot if they rent it out and buy it
Your nigga for the hoes and he say that he wanna try me, try me try me, try me
You might also like[Chorus]
He can eat the box, but I still tell him we don't label that
I should call him Weezy, he be tryna see where baby at
Bitches think they really sending shots, but it be laser tag
If he run into me, CPS, can't get your baby back

[Outro]
You can't get your nigga back, mmm, give me that
Nigga, playin' with my money, it could get your cherry whacked
I don't fuck with rap bitches, mmm, bitches very wack
Call me Asian 'cause I really ain't fuckin' with none of thatEmbed
