TranslationsPortuguÃªsTake My Hand Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
A painted heart on a sidewalk
A bleeding sun on a silver screen
I feel my ego when I talk
Lost myself in the in-between
Lustful eyes filled with love now
Sending in every cavalry
A few more souls on the bus now

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Shut my eyes right at seventeen
Always hits me
I'm always shifting
[Chorus: Luke, All]
Take my hand, now and forever
Where I stand, how can you live and let die?
Young man, look in the mirror
Take my hand and don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)
Don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)

[Verse 2: Luke]
Told myself maybe someday
I'd fall down from the centrepiece
I treat my mind like an ashtray
I owe you an apology
Breaking plans on a Sunday
With myself, maybe make some peace
I forgot every birthday

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Luke & Calum]
Open eyes right at twenty-three
Always hits me
That I'm always shifting

[Chorus: Luke, All]
Take my hand, now and forever
Where I stand, how can you live and let die?
Young man, look in the mirror
Take my hand and don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)
Don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)

Pick apart all of the pieces
Well, I'm running out of time
Iron out all of the creases
And just hang it out to dry
Shallow hearts for shallow minds
That ache to be alive
You fall apart and redefine
What keeps you up at night

[Buildup: Luke]
Oh, take my hand, now and forever
Where I stand, just as you're losing yourself again
Look in the mirror

[Chorus: Luke, All]
Take my hand, now and forever
Where I stand, how can you live and let die?
Young man, look in the mirror
Take my hand and don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)
Don't you ever let go
(Take my hand, now and forever)
(Take my hand, now and forever)10Embed
