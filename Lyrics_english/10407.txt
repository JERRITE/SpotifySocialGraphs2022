No Rest for the Wicked Lyrics[Verse 1]
My one heart hurt another
So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now

[Chorus]
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight
[Verse 2]
If one heart can mend another
Only then can we begin
So won't you hold on a little longer?
Don't let them get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now

[Chorus 2]
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight
I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart, but I broke it every time

[Pre-Chorus]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now

[Chorus 2]
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight
I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart, but I broke it every timeYou might also like41Embed
