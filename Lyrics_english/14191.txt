Jackie Wants A Black Eye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jackie wants a black eye
Some proof that she's been hit
And John wants the answers
But the questions just don't quit
And we're sitting in the rain
And we're feeling like the weather
You could say that we're alone
But we're lonely together

[Chorus]
We're all in it together now
As we all fall apart
And we're swapping little pieces
Of our broken little hearts
[Verse 2]
Jackie is jumping in the quicksand
But it isn't what you think
She's safe because she knows
The more you fight, the more you sink
And John is following the black cloud
To keep him from the sun
So he bends over now
Something has finally begun

[Chorus]
We're all in it together now
As we all fall apart
And we're swapping little pieces
Of our broken little hearts


[Verse 3]
And we've been hurting so long
That our pleasure is our pain
Are we madly in love
Or are we madly insane?
When yesterday's love defines you
And today that love is gone
Tomorrow keeps you guessing
The roller coaster is rolling on
You might also like[Chorus]
We're all in it together now
As we all fall apart
And we're swapping little pieces
Of our broken little hearts
We're all in it together now
As we all fall apart
And we're swapping little pieces
Of our broken little heartsEmbed
