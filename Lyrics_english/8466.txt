They want to kill me lyrics [letter from "They want to kill me" ft. Anuel AA]

[Enter: Anuel AA]
(Real until death, did you hear bastard?)

[Choir: Tempo & Anuel AA]
They want to kill me, I'm aware and I know
(I vo'a shit in the Devil's mother; Anuel)
They want to hunt me first and I found them
(Mera, tell me, tempo, the devils)
We get straight in hand in hand
(The untouchables, the Illuminati 'did you hear bastard?)
We set the guy and left
They wanted to invent with me and I used them (haha!)
[Verse 1: tempo]
I have them agonizing in a coma (What?)
Gimnasta 'do their' maroma '
This is calm, because in 3 days, they could not build to Rome (NAH)
You are not kings, the chair has always been mine, son 'and whore is not a joke
Steve Harvey crowned it by mistake, deliver the crown
And now who is behind?
I feel his 'punchline' exhausted, tired
Since the chipete spoils, I am frustrated '
I swear by mommy, from now on, the one who puts clown (ah)
I'm going to put myself, wherever I am and I'm going to get it down from a guy (prr)

[Bridge: Tempo & Anuel AA]
We walk in the street crazy and you are running (BRR)
Things changed and the 'yours' are dying (haha!)
So I don't understand, how you keep fucking
Bastards that my milk knows, because I am getting on your women (hey)

[Choir: Tempo & Anuel AA]
They want to kill me, I'm aware and I know
They want to hunt me first and I found them
We get straight in hand in hand
We set the guy and left
They wanted to invent with me and I used them (BRR)
They want to kill me, I'm aware and I know
(Real until death, he heard?)
They want to hunt me first and I found them
We get straight in hand in hand
We set the guy and left
(Mera, Tell me, tempo; the devils, the untouchables, he heard?)
They wanted to invent with me and I used them (BRR)

I am a soldier and thank God to 'this' rifle' I learned to shoot (I learned to shoot)
My short is from Austria and AK is from Arabia
In hell you are going to burn (you're going to burn)
I watched you 'to hunt, from the cars we watched' to go down and the stick 'I vamo' to pull (brrr!), I watched 'to bed
From bullets you look 'to bathe, you have to work (work)
They will investigate me and they will look for me
But I never vo'a delivering (I do not vo'a deliver), I vo'a fugo
They have to catch me or they will have to kill me (or they will have to kill me)
And if I die tomorrow, Tonka is going to avenge me (he will avenge me)
And Joker and Phillie are going to ride
Although I never get up again
El Chapo and Pablo Escobar (Pablo Escobar)

[Choir: Tempo & Anuel AA]
They want to kill me, I'm aware and I know (I know)
They want to hunt me, first and I found them
We get straight in hand in hand
We set the guy and left
They wanted to invent with me and I used them (BRR)
They want to kill me, I'm aware and I know
(Mera, Tell me, Tempo, Puâ€”)
They want to hunt me first and I found them
We get straight in hand in hand
We set the guy and left
(Real until death, did you hear baby?)
They wanted to invent with me and I used them (BRR)
