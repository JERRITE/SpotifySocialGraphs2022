Sailing Away LyricsHere I go down memory lane
I'm always sinking with the ship that way
But every time I lay my eyes on that hull
I slip to the bottom and I don't need nothing

When you don't need nothing
It's a certain type of game you play
I don't need a home, don't need a lover
No friends around me to support each other

And now I'm sailing away
I learn from the best how to cut the rest
And then I'll take what I get
And won't want for anything
And now I'm sailing away
I don't need a home, don't need a lover
I'll be out on my own
Come hell or high water

One of my girls, she's living the dream
Out in a cabin for a dollar a day
And 'cause that's the way she has to have it
I'll send her my letters, a candle, and a jacket

And the other's on the river
She'll be out there till her dying day
And 'cause that's the way she has to have it
I'll skip each stone, I won't keep it just to have it

And now I'm sailing away
I learn from the best how to cut the rest
And then I'll take what I get
And won't want for anything

And now I'm sailing away
I don't need a home, don't need a lover
I'll be out on my own
Come hell or high water

Here I go down memory lane
I'm always sinking with the ship that way
But every time I lay eyes on that hull
I slip to the bottom and I don't need nothingYou might also likeEmbed
