Bella Lyrics [Words of "Bella"]

[Intro]
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella

[Chorus]
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"
[Verse 1]
It was a phenomenon, it was not human
The kind of woman who changes the greatest offender into a gentleman
An unparalleled beauty, everyone wants to take it
Without knowing that she leads them by boat
Hypnotized, we could give everything
She only had to ask, then immediately we started
We were trying to impress him, to become his favorite
Without knowing that she leads them by boat
But when I see her dancing in the evening
I would like to become the chair she sits on
Or less than that, a less than nothing
Just a stone on its way

[Chorus]
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"

[Verse 2]
Yes, it's a phenomenon that likes to haunt our dreams
This woman was named "Bella the golden skin"
Women hated her, all jealous of her
But men could only love him
She was not from here, neither easy nor difficult
Synonymous with "magnificent", at his feet: that disciples
Who quickly became undecided, trembling like leaves
She caressed you without even touching you
But when I see her dancing in the evening
I would like to become the chair she sits on
Or less than that, a less than nothing
Just a stone on its way
You might also like [refrain]
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"
She answered to the name of Bella"
The local people did not want the Cher-lâ
she made all the towns quake
People said to me: "Beware of this girl"

[Verse 3]
Come on, make me turn my head, hey hey
Turn your head, hey hey
Make me stupid like my ieds-p ', hey hey
Beast like my ieds-p ', hey hey
I am the shadow of your ien-ch ', hey hey
The shadow of your ien-ch ', hey hey
Turn my head, hey hey
Turn your head, hey hey
Turn my head, hey hey
Turn your head, hey hey
Make me stupid like my ieds-p ', hey hey
Beast like my ieds-p ', hey hey
I am the shadow of your ien-ch ', hey hey
The shadow of your ien-ch ', hey hey
Turn my head, hey hey
Turn your head, hey hey
