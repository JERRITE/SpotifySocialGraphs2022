Nothin’ to Me Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Why they tryna play me like I don't know the facts?
It’s really from the heart, so I don't hold it back
Is you really ‘bout the block or do you really love the cab?
I be chilling off of Broadway, shawty know the ave
Dancing like a jabber, jabroni on his ass
Hanging by myself, but I was lonely in the past
I don't gotta ask, I already got a pass
Your homie phoney as a mask, when I’m rolling like the brass
Man, holy in this mass book, I'ma need the cash
Now, tell me how the Backwoods got niggas going bad
Ain't it funny how the fast footed always come in last
Yeah, I'm always on the path for dying, I can lap
[Chorus]
Please tell ‘em, that's nothing to me
Hard work pays off, it was nothing for cheap
They hurt, they lost, they wanted to see
We was the first to evolve, but it's nothing to me
Please tell ‘em, please tell ‘em, please tell ‘em
Please tell ‘em, that's nothing to me
Hard work pays off, it was nothing for cheap
They hurt, they lost, they wanted to see
We was the first to evolve, but it's nothing to me

[Bridge]
We thirsty, we dogs, we been hungry to eat
We in the dirt with the mob while you ducking the cheese
These niggas burn to me, hard to be, up on the street
My niggas hurting, we mourn for the ones who deceased

[Chorus]
Please tell ‘em, please tell ‘em, please tell ‘em
Please tell ‘em, that’s nothing to me
Hard work pays off, it was nothing for cheap
They hurt, they lost, they wanted to see
We was the first to evolve, but it’s nothing to meYou might also likeEmbed
