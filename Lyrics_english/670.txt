Lyrics memories ["Memories" letter]]

[Intro: Mora & Jhay Cortez]
YAH-AH-AH
I warned you, that if it failed, 'I was going to make you cry (I was going to make you cry)
Your heart is made of stone and your crystal tear (crystal tear ')
Said 'to say "I miss you" to be do' strange '
He collapsed in minute 'what I built in Do' Year '
And to Vece 'it was fine, but it hurt me
You are not real, baby, you ere 'a hoax
[Chorus: Jhay Cortez & Mora, both]
Today I delete your memory, your contact and to 'your video' (your video ')
The end of this story came, do not regret because I don't think (I don't believe you anymore)
And today I delete your memory, your contact and to 'your video' (your video ')
The end of this story came, do not regret because I don't believe you (I don't believe you anymore)

[Verse 1: Jhay Cortez]
Baby, you Ere 'Feka, just like that ass
It has' real tits, but the heart fatul
From that lies life I was the only pure
Stay with the bus, with the win 'and with the puddle
I gave you to you, but I also gave him Delete
To the photo in Pari '
And that I shit into the mother, to give birth to me
That's why I will bloc your profile
I didn't want to go back, just listen to you moan
Baby, without me you don't look ', although it makes the' look '
You have the fault, no matter how much I accuse me '
So much 'excuse' that you can fill Die 'Buser'
You're going to see the devil when me crosses you '

[Chorus: Jhay Cortez & Mora]
Your memory, your contact and to 'your video'

Today I delete your memory, your contact and to 'your video' (your video ')
The end of this story came, do not regret because I don't believe you (I don't believe you anymore)

And I read you even if you 'pisi'
When I had no car I was looking for you by bike
But you failed me and you put it Easy
Stay with Toa 'Las Louis Vuitton and Yeezy
If you want, look for another bastard to take you purchase '
I will not give you my heart to break it again '
The least you want 'e' have me against you
You don't work ', and what is not useful
Now it's your turn to cry and cry
When you see me with another is that I will remember
You can see me, not touch, without touching
With you was that I learned to never forgive

[Chorus: Mora]
And today I delete your memory, your contact and to 'your video' (OH-OH-OH)
The end of this story arrived, do not regret because I don't believe you (OH-OH-OH)
So today I deleted youâ€”
