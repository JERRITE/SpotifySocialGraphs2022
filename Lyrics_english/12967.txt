Origins Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start
Meant to play the penitent part
Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find
Tempted fate and knowledge divine
View in there a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere

[Chorus]
Is it so hard to forgive the way
That we've been made to live
How much is required to set things right
Have you confused your power with mine
[Verse 2]
View in there a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere
Imminent you seem to be
A picture of fragility
What is it that you think of me
Is it a woman that you see

[Chorus]
Is it so hard to forgive the way
That we've been made to live
How much is required to set things right
Have you confused your power with mineYou might also like4Embed
