River Flows In You (Eclipse Vocal Version) - Radio Mix LyricsIf you have the time to share the road with me
If you can imagin we could both be free
What I long to do is give my heart to you
So that you can always hold it close to you

Holding you, holding you
It's in you
The river flows in you
Slowly now, slowly now
It's in you
The river flows in you
If you have the time to share the road with me
If you can imagin we could both be free

Holding you, holding you
It's in you
The river flows in you
Slowly now, slowly now
It's in you the river flows in you

If you have the time to share the road with me
If you can imagin we could both be free
What I long to do is give my heart to you
So that you can always hold it close to youYou might also likeEmbed
