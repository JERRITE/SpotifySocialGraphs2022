The Chemicals Between Us Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want you to remember
A love so full it could send us always
I want you to surrender
All my feelings rose today

[Verse 2]
And I want you to remain
The power of children can amaze
I'll try not to complain
I know that's a pisser baby
[Chorus]
The chemicals between us
The walls that lie between us
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier state
Than lying in this bed

[Verse 2]
I want you to remember
Everything you said
Every driven word
Like a hammer
Fell to my head

[Chorus]
The chemicals between us
The walls that lie between us
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier fate
Than lying in this bed
The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us
Lying in this bed
You might also like[Bridge]
We're of hollow men
We are the naked ones
We never meant you harm
Never meant you wrong
And I'd like to thank
All of my lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers

[Chorus]
The chemicals between us
The army of achievers
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier state
Than lying in this bed
The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us
Chemicals

[Ending]
