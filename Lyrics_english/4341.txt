The Mellao Lyricsbien paste
Mami, well paste
(Repeats three times)
Walking on Eslembao Street
Calm and tired work
When this jevita passes me through the lao
I say: what mommy that tumbao

What a pretty face, what a walk
Two or three steps and gave me to look back
Ea ray looks for now ...
I saw something that left me amazement
There was a shaman lunching Sentao
And I had no teeth and I was Mellao
And I yelled at him: How chewing that mellao!
So it was that confusion began
She thought I shout at her colillon
I didn't know why, she turned back and gave me a fish
Look stupid, dirty, fresh
Mommy give it to me if I deserve it
Only these things happen to me
For shouting the choir that says that ...

[Chorus]

How chew that mellao
Tremendous problem I have been looking for
How chew that mellao
Like Guineo in the mouth of Vieja and looked at Pal Lao
How chew that mellao

He has no teeth but squeezes like a chao chao
How chew that mellao
So small, hey, but that Esmayao
Well paste
Mami, well paste
Well paste
Mami, well paste
Well paste
Mami, well paste
Well paste
Mami, well paste

This for Guaya squeech
In a guillao corner
In Colombia, Venezuela or Cibao
From Cabo Rojo to Humacao
What a little ma?
Take out what you have
Give me a little melao, Melao
Ten Cuidao Mami out there comes the Guaraguao
Eating the Soleaos chicks cough
Reggaeton Moreno, so that the chocolate moves
Without fighting what there is is a vacylon
On the street, disco or on the balcony
Or in the jump in the mattress

Take out what you have Gualdao give me a little melao melao
Julio Voltio arrives by telling Mellao
That does not fall asleep.

[Chorus 2]

How chew that mellao
The mellao is the button when the pants is fine
How chew that mellao
The Mellao swallos the lycra, the skirt or that g-strong hangcao
How chew that mellao
I don't get offended by miss but he has show tirao
How chew that mellao
Hey abuser after the young, the hangs
Well paste
