[Verse 1]
Faintly tomorrow we
The wind hurts each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Whee, Hwi, Hwi
Whee, Hwi, Hwi
Whee, huh
Whee, Hwi, Hwi
Whee, huh, comfort
[Chorus]
Do you wanna get some more
It's just blind
Do you Wanna Go Somewhere
We only try to avoid it
Yaya
Again, Yaya
Even if we try to have more we
It's just hovering in place

[Verse 2]
The older we were
Only black hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
Whee, Hwi, Hwi
Whee, Hwi, Hwi
Whee, huh

[Chorus]
Do you wanna get some more
It's just blind
Do you Wanna Go Somewhere
We only try to avoid it
Yaya
Again, Yaya
Even if we try to have more we
It's just hovering in place

As the world is over
The sun goes down
In a long dark darkness
We seem to be abandoned
Yaya
Again, Yaya
Even if we try to have more we
It's just hovering in place

[OUTRO]
It's just blind
I'm just trying to avoid it, Woo
Yayayayai (Yaiyai)
Again, Yaya
Even though the rain falls, the flowers bloom 4Embed
