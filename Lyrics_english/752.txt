[Verse 1]
He who eats silent
With her, impossible to take me away
As they failed it is put pa'l unchiteous
She is access control, but it gave me the beepper
He was all the weekend
[Chorus]
Think-to-so I'm not with you anymore, oh-oh
Because I don't follow her, I call her, I don't write to her
And if they knew the thing that I do 'when there is no witness'
Lead-A-As stayed hidden, oh-ohh
That somo 'more' what a friend ', that never' neat '
But no 'devoured' and each one on their way

[Verse 2]
Zeta del Fino, the Cup 'of Wine
Nobody intervened
I said to the place that for the first time 'Vimo'
He decipher his weak point, thought that I was fortune teller
In the bed somo 'one, on the street no' dividimo '
I hope they multiply what they want
You know that I am Pa 'Ti Twenty-Four Seven
That nobody tells the things that happen
She goes on top, she never goes back
Leave it 'to say what they want
I calm like it as in silence
With you none can invent
'Toy aware of the one who puts on me

[Chorus]
Think-to-so I'm not with you anymore, oh-oh
Because I don't follow her, I call her, I don't write to her
And if they knew the thing we do when there is no witness'
Lead-A-As stayed hidden, oh-ohh
That somo 'more' what a friend ', that never' neat '
But no 'devoured' and each one on their way
