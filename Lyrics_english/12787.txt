OutRight Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's not this life, it's these dreams that bring down
The me inside but maybe tonight I'll get the story right
I saw you smiling with him
Hurt to watch, but helped me understand
This life isn't your friend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just I wish sometimes dreaming was as real
As this feeling since I left you
I'll be back to new
[Chorus]
You tell me that you're lonely
You tell me something isn't working out right
I ask you to be honest, make a promise
Tell me that we'll work this out right

[Verse 2]
Excuse me miss, I read lips, you might want
To take a step on back and look at your tracks

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I wish sometimes dreaming was as real
As this feeling since I left you
I'll be back to new

[Chorus]
You tell me that you're lonely
You tell me something isn't working out right
I ask you to be honest, make a promise
Tell me that we'll work this out right

[Bridge]
There's not a day my weekend starts, no
I've been on the run since I was five
When the playground was all I had to discover life
Open your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's just I wish sometimes dreaming was as real
As this feeling since I left you
I'll be back to new

[Chorus]
You tell me that you're lonely
You tell me something isn't working out right
I ask you to be honest, make a promise
Tell me that we'll work this out
You tell me that you're lonely
You tell me something isn't working out right
I ask you to be honest, make a promise
Tell me that we'll work this out right9Embed
