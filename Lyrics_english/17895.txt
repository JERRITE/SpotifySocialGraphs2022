They say lyrics ["say" letter]]

[Intro: Matt Hunter]
Maybe after you I end up being one more
Don't fall in love, I got to listen
There are several things we have to try
And I wanted to take advantage

[Pre-Caro: Matt Hunter]
Give me what i want
I heard that your love is passenger
But it would ride on the flight
And although I know this is temporary
You are what I want
I heard you are cold like ice
An angel who fell from heaven
And I enter evil
[Chorus: Matt Hunter]
They say you are bad
No one is saved
You wrap with your body
They all want
They say you are bad
No one is saved
And as a model
They all want
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH

[Verse 1: Lele Pons]
Traffic for
While I crossed they looked at me
I don't want anything with them
I tell him with a look
They say I'm evil
And cold like winter
They die for a kiss
But the play is difficult
You wanted to check
Why do I am a criminal
You will see how this will end
I wanted to tell you what

[Chorus: Lele Pons, Matt Hunter]
They say I'm bad
No one is saved
I know they want my body
I don't want anything from them
They say you are bad
No one is saved
And as a model
They all want

Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH

[Verse 2: Matt Hunter]
I love you, even if it is not me the first
Slowly, your love is very light
Allow me one more minute
You usually treat them badly
But I think that can change
But only, oh

[Pre-Caro: Matt Hunter, Lele Pons]
Give me what i want
I heard that your love is passenger
But it would ride on the flight
And although I know this is temporary
You know what I want
Many as you have seen passengers
Making me get out of the ground
For something temporary
[Chorus: Lele Pons, Matt Hunter]
They say I'm bad
No one is saved
I know they want my body
I don't want anything from them
They say you are bad
No one is saved
And as a model
They all want

[Post-Coro: Matt Hunter & Lele Pons, Matt Hunter]
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH (OH)
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH (OH-OH-OUH)
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH (OH-OH-OH-OH)
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH (EH)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-eh (oh, no, no)
Ah-ah, Ah-Ah-Ah-EH
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-eh (oh-oh-oh) 15embed
