Melt the Snow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes out my window
I notice that you've been crying over him
And I wonder why you just don't
Kick him to the curb instead of giving in

[Chorus]
You see love at first is summer time
That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks its gonna end
But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again
But you should know when it gets too cold
You're not alone, I'll melt the snow
[Verse 2]
Some nights I can hear you
Screaming on the phone over something that he did
And I wonder what can I do
To make you throw him out so you can let me in

[Chorus]
You see love at first is summer time
That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks its gonna end
But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again
But you should know when it gets too cold
You're not alone, I'll melt the snow

[Post-Chorus] X7
I'll melt the snow

[Chorus] X2
You see love at first is summer time
That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks its gonna end
But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again
But you should know when it gets too cold
You're not alone, I'll melt the snow
You might also like[Outro]
But you should know
When it gets too cold, you're not alone
I'll melt the snow
I'll melt the snowEmbed
