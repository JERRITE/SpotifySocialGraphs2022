SUSPENSIVE POINTS LYRICSLETRA of "suspensive points"

[Verse 1: Juan]
I can't take it anymore without seeing you
Answer since this is life or death
You already know me, I was never so strong

[Pre-car: David]
You left our love in oblivion
This relationship at suspensive points
Tell me if it was worth it
Tell me if it was worth it
[Chorus: Juan, David]
More than a thousand years will pass and I do not forget
Don't ask me, I won't be your friend
Being with you is my destiny

More than a thousand years will pass and I do not forget
Don't ask me, I won't be your friend
I will not accept the suspensive points

Goes up

[Verse 2: Pablo]
Delivering so much was my weakness
And your kisses are now my need
Now only loneliness accompanies me
With you I feel that I lose my dignity, Yeh

Yours, if I don't have you and I feel yours
And still I keep wondering
If I was not enough for you (for you)
I was not enough for you

Yours, if I don't have you and I feel yours
And still I keep wondering
If I was not enough for you, uuuuh
