Free Love Lyrics [The lyrics "Free Love"]

[Verse 1]
Your innocent dreams are like an icy artifact
They will always tell about us, they are the strongest extract
The road ended here, and only fog in front
We will let us go, believe me, we will do without wounds

[Hook]
You are my feet slave
You are a slave of my dreams
My little prince
I am the queen of the worlds
[Updaines]
Let's play free love better
Live like a bird in a cage - an interrupted flight

[Chorus]
Free Love
Free Love
Free Love
Free love
Free Love
Free Love
Free Love
Free love

[Verse 2]
It is like sunlight, sliding on the glass
Like a blow to the lips is unobtrusive
This is a sip of water among a magic wasteland
And you are afraid, baby, stuck ahead of time
Remember these words, they are more tender than hoar
They will deal with us like a revenge of a brutal goddess
Remember music poison, do not be afraid, it doesn't hurt
It's like black rocks, powerful waves

[Hook]
You are my feet slave
You are a slave of my dreams
My little prince
I am the Queen of the Worlds

Let's play free love better
Live like a bird in a cage - an interrupted flight

[Hook]
You are my feet slave
You are a slave of my dreams
My little prince
I am the Queen of the Worlds
[Updaines]
Let's play free love better
Live like a bird in a cage - an interrupted flight

[Chorus]
