Blind Alley Lyrics[Intro]
Hey boy, you got a good conversation
You got a real smooth line
But you're not penetrating
Somebody else has got my time

[Chorus]
You're runnin' up a blind alley, blind alley
Blind alley, blind alley
You see, I've got who I want
(Got who I want, sorry you don't!)
[Verse 2]
My love told me you were coming
Said you would try and break us up
But let me tell you something
Your talk ain't good enough

[Chorus]
You're runnin' up a blind alley, blind alley
Blind alley, blind alley
You see, I've got who I want
(Got who I want, sorry you don't!)

Ohhh, baby
Too bad, child!

[Verse 3]
What you want is temporary
But what I got is gonna last
One day we're gonna marry
So quit your talking so fast

[Chorus]
You're runnin' up a blind alley, blind alley
Blind alley, blind alley
You see, I've got who I want
(Got who I want, sorry you don't!)

You're running up a blind alley
You're running, you're running
You're running up a blind alley
You're running, you're running

[Ad-Libs]
Ohhh, baby
I tried to let you know
But every time I turn around...
I've got who I want (Sorry you don't)
Baby, baby, baby
I love him, yes I do
He pleases me, yes he does (Sorry you don't)
I hope you find the right one
Yes I do
I've got who I want (Sorry you don't)
I wish you all the luck in the world
Oh yeah
I've got who I want! (Sorry you don't)Embed
