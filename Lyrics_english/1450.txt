21 Reasons Lyrics[Verse 1]
One is you make me happy
Two is you set me free
From all the things that held me
Back from just being me
Thank you for all the sweetness
Now I can finally breathe
Now I can finally breathe
But baby, don't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (Your friends)
And I hate your moods (Moods)
And I shouldn't love you
[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do

[Verse 2]
Three is the way you hold me
That's what I waited for
Five shots, we're getting naughty
Movin' out on the floor
You took away the lonely
And I let you comfort  me
Loving the company
But, baby, don't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (Your friends)
And I hate your moods (Moods)
And I shouldn't love you

[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do
You might also like[Bridge]
My friends say you ain't good enough
And maybe I should give you up
But I got my reasons
And here comes another one
Here comes another one
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on countin'
I shouldn't love you

[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do

[Outro]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on countin'
And I shouldn't love you
But I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do11Embed
