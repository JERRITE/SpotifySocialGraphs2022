Somebody New Lyrics [Super Junior "SOMEBODY NEW" lyrics]

[Verse 1]
It's still full of mistakes
I don't like something
Why are you looking at me with such eyes
The more gorgeous it becomes, the more
I know your empty heart
I can't be friendly with you in that mirror

[POST-VERSE]
Oh, I think it's a little broken somewhere
I think it's all twisted with a mess
From any time to myself
Is it not welcome?
Even if I still become an adult
I'm wandering after getting lost
Endlessly
Standing on the road, let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
When I forgot when
With my precious people
I want to regain my last dreams

[Chorus]
Singing what does not change
I want to remain as me that doesn't change
Me and you forever
Somebody New, SOMEBODY NEW

[Verse 2]
The moment I was the most
Time spent with you
All that is once
It has become the past, but
No more reality and ideal
Unbound
I'm here now
It's not too late

[Pre-Chorus]
When I forgot when
With my precious people
I want to regain my last dreams
You might Also Like [Chorus]
Singing what does not change
I want to remain as me that doesn't change
Me and you forever
Somebody New, SOMEBODY NEW

[Refrain]
Like this
Even if it's not a perfect journey
It's more important to be happy
I'm okay with this as it is
Me and you forever
Somebody New, SOMEBODY NEW

[Bridge]
When passing through the endless stars
When the morning sun rises
Everything starts
Brilliantly alive
Every day becomes a miracle in front of you
Looking at the not disappearing
Want to run on a long road
More than anyone

[Chorus]
Singing what does not change
I want to remain as me that doesn't change
Me and you forever
Somebody New, SOMEBODY NEW
[Refrain]
Like this
Even if it's not a perfect journey
It's more important to be together
I'm okay with this as it is
Me and you forever
Somebody New, SOMEBODY NEWEMBED
