Ms. Seductive LyricsVerse One:
Did you notice me looking at you?
All the way from the other side of the room?
Now honey you caught my eye from a mile away
Was on my way leaving, but now I might have to stay

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause you
There is just something 'bout you
Maybe it's the way you walk girl
But I just could not figure out
Chorus:
Why you give me butterflies when I
Simply just look at you
Why must I fall for you? Ooo-Ooo-Ooo
Or why I can't think of words when I
Simply approach you
I don't know what to do, Ooo-Ooo-Ooo

Verse Two:
Is it those eyes?
Or those lips?
Or the way you sway those hips?
Or maybe your hair?
How it shines?
Ms. Seductive I can't help but try

Pre-Chorus:
Cause darlin' it's you
There is just something 'bout you
Maybe it's the way you walk girl
But I just could not figure out

Chorus:
Why you give me butterflies when I
Simply just look at you
Why must I fall for you? Ooo-Ooo-Ooo

I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
Feels like I'm in a dream
Please make this last
'Cause I just cannot help the fact

Chorus:
That you give me butterflies when I
Simply just look at you
Why must I fall for you? Ooo-Ooo-Ooo
Or why I can't think of words when I
Simply approach you
I don't know what to do, Ooo-Ooo-OooEmbed
