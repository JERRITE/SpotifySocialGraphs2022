Let me shout lyrics [letter of "Let me shout"]

[Verse 1]
Memories that I carry on the skin
The cold nights of yesterday
Your shadow that I love my faith
There is nothing to lose

[Pre Coro]
I just want to see the night pass
And in his darkness
And start the hell
I just want to finish
Be the light of time
[Chorus]
Let me scream (there is no going back)
Life killing (which matters now)
I'm going to start (I want to shout)
Reach the end
Let me fly (without returning)
I'm not going to cry (just shout)
Go to start (I can sing)
Go to the end
That nothing can reach us

[Verse 2]
Memories a thousand dreams
That went out with the sun
With no one with nothing
That my heart enlightens me

[Pre Coro]
I just want to see the night pass
And in his darkness
And start the hell
I just want to finish
Be the light of time

[Chorus]
Let me scream (there is no going back)
Life killing (which matters now)
I'm going to start (I want to shout)
Reach the end
Let me fly (without returning)
I'm not going to cry (just shout)
Go to start (I can sing)
Go to the end
That nothing can reach us
