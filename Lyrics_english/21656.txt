Better Than Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll meet you back on Kingsley Street where we fell
For the only thing we ever feared
Back where all the silence made my heart melt
Where the sound of you was all I'd hear
Da da do do, da da do do
Da da do do, da da do do

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Even when that love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mine, mine
[Verse 2]
Sitting watching movies, couch tomatoes
Wanna kiss your eyes, those almond eyes
Oh take me to that Laurel View
Where it was just me and you
Those were the days, holidays
Da da do do, da da do do
Da da do do, da da do do

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Even when that love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mine

[Bridge]
I want you to know
That my heart is better than before
All those times, changing our minds
What you're worth made it fine
'Cause you know that in my mind

[Verse 1]
I'll meet you back on Kingsley Street where we fell
For the only thing that we ever feared
Da da do do, da da do do
Da da do do, da da do do
You might also like[Chorus]
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
No, you can't take it from me ever
You were mine
You were mine

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Even when that love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mine1Embed
