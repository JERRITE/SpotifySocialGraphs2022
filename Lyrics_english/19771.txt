Sheeple lyrics [intro: kartky]
We have a boom again
We have a boom again

[Verse 1: kartky]
We have a boom again
A blunt crowd mastered skyscrapers and cages
And nooks and crannies that no one was worried about for a long time
My guardian angel is dead, I found him next to the cage
I have his disk with vocals, we will spend after death and waks
Like ghost hunters, myths, buchy breeders
I have a head on my neck and plans for light years, without a putty
I will not move without a receipt, so I give away my soul and I have no idea what I play
I do not sleep with the takeover and I will not force my happiness to knock on the gates
I jump out of the frame and exchange roles, find my face and come back every Tuesday
And if I mistake the days - I fuck
When I mock moments, forgive me, I never know how to do it
"Those who know the knowledge of OCB" - I always say that
How you try to change my face, tame the boulder
Know that I have the will to fight like a Hulk and more mastery than you think, that's me
I fuck the uneven world, don't let him make it this time?
Because I look at the pupils of the dragon like Smaug
[Verse 2: arik]
This is!
I have fucked up for the rhythm of work, I'm not following them like walking dead
But I have saved to go through life as I want
They can bow to my belt and I think they feel as I despise them
Like a hyena I take a shine, there is no saliva on them
If someone is to dislocate this year, it's me
When I see the clich√© of your past, I feel sorry
Closed herds, lemmings, task machines
Chaos in systems, not at all the world
They tell me how to live, they tell me how to breathe
What dreams I have at night, what do I want from life
Why am I not him, why do I not touch the carcass
Why can't I live like others, don't have any questions
I don't know why I have it - from the series
I don't know why the same - better do it quickly
I don't know what you need stress for - think
Why do you need a cash - think
I see you, I think I feel sorry for these Sheep People
Sheep People, Sheep People, Sheep People
These Sheep People, Sheep People, Sheep People
Sheep People, Sheep People, Sheep People
