I don't miss you Lyricsese Energy Field In my brain
I sat from downloads when I think
Contamin my senses with memories
Well, every atom is surprised in my body

That dine embodied here in my chest
That irrigated to the tip of my fingers
He no longer has the blood for them
Well, every artery of my body surprises you

[CHORUS]
I don't miss you, I swear
I don't miss you, I swear
I don't miss you, noooo
It misses you every vein, it misses you every cell
I miss you a heart, I miss you a thought
I miss the calcium of two hundred nineteen bones

My neurons miss you, my mouth is more surprised
I miss my reason, I miss you a feeling
I miss you to the slightest part of my body

That machine entailed here in the center
Condemned to the most intense work
You no longer want to receive food
Well, every viscera is surprised in my body

Those muscles that wrap my skeleton
They can't even get moving
They perspire me through the skin that are covered
Well, every pore from my body is surprised

[CHORUS]
I don't miss you, I swear
I don't miss you, I swear
I don't miss you, noooo

It misses you every vein, it misses you every cell
I miss you a heart, I miss you a thought
I miss the calcium of two hundred nineteen bones
You Might Also Likete miss my neurons, my mouth is more surprised
I miss my reason, I miss you a feeling
I miss you to the slightest part of my body

I don't miss you
(Noooo)
I miss my reason, I miss you a feeling
I miss you to the slightest part of my bodyAmbed
