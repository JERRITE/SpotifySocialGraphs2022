Lassie lyrics it was one day and i was four years old
I believed more in evil than what was good
I was four years old and there were horrible types in my room
Black Wallpaper Cold Trumpets Blood Pancakes and Planets
And in the air buzzed the darkness was very dark
And alone and scared I was
Nobody likes me?
Nobody likes me
Then she came as a light out of the darkness
She lick my cheek and said “With me you are safe and hot
I will warm your heart, I like you ”
And in her eyes, love spit
I met Lassie, I met Lassie and I saw that goodness existed
The star of hope shone clearly around her fuzzy tail
I met Lassie, I met Lassie, she whispered to me her woe
We went paw in hand and in my heart felt far

If one is small and weak (the angels cry)
And gets beaten with blows (when souls die)
Nothing you understand but the heart it screams why?
If one is small and weak (oh, the guy sobbing)
Every night every day (among silent goals)
Of all evil you turn blue inside the outside, why do I exist?

But horrors can turn
And dandelion light their buds to grow up at dawn
When the ghosts slip against I yet
Then she lures to us, me & you, with all her love

I met Lassie, I met Lassie, baby you're like a rose
You kiss my sad tears with your soft nose
I met Lassie, I met Lassie, she makes me so hot and happy
Together we go paw in him on the walk of life

Herity can turn around
And dandelion light their buds to grow up to a thousand
When the ghosts slip against I yet
Then she lures to us, me & you, with all her love
I met Lassie, I met Lassie and I saw that goodness existed
The star of hope shone brightly against her fuzzy tail

We went paw in hand and in my heart felt far
We went paw in hand and in my heart felt long .... embed
