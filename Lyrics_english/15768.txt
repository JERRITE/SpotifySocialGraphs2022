My worst mistake (live) [first row] lyrics [lyrics by "my worst mistake (live)"]

[Verse 1]
It was as it was
You stole my soul, you had me at your feet
I loved you

[Verse 2]
I was wrong
I thought it was eternal to wake up in your skin
I dont know
[Pre-car]
If I was naive to thought that you would love the same
With the same force as a hurricane
It was my fault in the end to love you more
And just receive half

[Chorus]
I lowered my guard and exposed myself to pain
False caresses, cold in the room
I lowered my guard and opted my heart
So many words and no emotion
I loved you and it was not enough for you
And I still love you even though you have been my worst mistake

[Verse 3]
It is how it is
There is nothing left here, I have to lose
Perhaps

[Pre-car]
If I was naive to thought that you would love the same
With the same force as a hurricane
It was my fault in the end to love you more
And just receive half

[Chorus]
I lowered my guard and exposed myself to pain
False caresses, cold in the room
I lowered my guard and opted my heart
So many words and no emotion
I loved you and it was not enough for you
And I still love you even though you have been my worst mistake

WO-OH, WO-OH
It was my fault in the end to love you more
And just receive half

[Chorus]
I lowered my guard and exposed myself to pain
False caresses, cold in the room
I lowered my guard and opted my heart
So many words and no emotion
I loved you and it was not enough for you
And I still love you even though you have been my worst mistake

[The end]
WO-OH, WO-OH
My worst error
