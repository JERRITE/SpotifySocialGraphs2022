Movies Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is how it feels to be in love
This is life from above
There's no books anymore
I'm bound to that summer
Big box office hit
Making love to a counterfeit

[Chorus 1]
Why did so many
Get a rise out of me?
I love the movies
[Verse 2]
Some people feel what some people don't
Some people-watch until they explode
The meaning of life doesn't seem to shine like that screen

[Chorus 2]
Put me in a movie and everyone will know me
You'll be the star you know you are
The movies I watched when I was a kid
The hopes and the dreams
Don't give credit to the real things
I love the movies

[Bridge]
I know the meaning
I know the story
I know the glory
I love movies

[Outro]
I wanna be in my own movie
I wanna be
I wanna be the star of mine
Of my own, my own
My own
I wanna be the star
I wanna be
I wanna be the star of mine
Of my own, my own
My own
I wanna be
My, my own movieYou might also like21Embed
