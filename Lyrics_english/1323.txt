Take Over Lyrics[Intro]
Go

[Verse 1: MAX]
We at the top again, now what?
Heavy lay the crown, but count us higher than the mountain
And we be up here for the long run
Strap in for a long one
We got everybody on one (Woo)
Now you're coming at the king so you better not miss (Not miss, not miss)
And we only get stronger
With everything I carry up on my back
You should paint it up with a target
[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
Oh, woah
Why would you dare me to do it again?
Oh, come get your spoiler up ahead

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
We're taking over, we're taking over, ayy
Look at you come at my name, you oughta know by now
That we're taking ovеr, we're taking over, ayy
Maybе you wonder what you're futures gonna be, but
I got it all locked up (Go)

[Verse 2: MAX]
Take a lap, now
Don't be mad, now
Run it back, run it back, run it back now
I got bodies lining up, think you're dreaming of greatness?
Send you back home, let you wake up

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
Oh, woah
Why would you dare me to do it again?
Oh, come get your spoiler up ahead

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
We're taking over, we're taking over, ayy
Look at you come at my name, you oughta know by now
That we're taking over, we're taking over, ayy
Maybe you wonder what you're futures gonna be, but
I got it all locked up

再以后，除了厮杀，这还有其他么?
我左右，键盘噼啪着，时间滴答着
还不够，你的固执，让我来守候
哪怕太迟，也不想以后
就在这时，放肆的打斗
I got the heart of lion
I know the higher you climbing, the harder you fall (You know it)
I'm at the top of the mount
Too many bodies to count, I've been through it all
I had to weather the storm to get to level I'm on
That's how the legend was born
All of my enemies already dead
I'm bored, I'm ready for more
They know I'm ready for war
I told 'em

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
We're taking over, we're taking over, ayy
Look at you come at my name, you oughta know by now
That we're taking over, we're taking over, ayy
Maybe you wonder what you're futures gonna be, but
I got it all locked up (Go)8Embed
