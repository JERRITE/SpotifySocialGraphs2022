Bastard I can lyrics [letter from "bastard I can"]

I think life is one
That is why I want to live it at intense
When I'm in skinny cows
I never agüito, I turn an incense

Faithful believer of God
Although I hardly speak to him, I hardly pray
Mommy is what does that
That is why the pesos are not missing
Never leave things halfway
I finish it if I start it
I have few friends
To all the fingers

Get out of envy to see
How income uploads
Enjoy the process

Vilalo pa 'that I don't know how much
Without believing the mere mere
That all are equal here
That all are made of leather

They saw me well dressed
And driving a new car
It was because I put eggs
It is not believed that this is luck

Years in this is that I carry
They don't see my time spend
Because I always renew

I started well indebted
Now I owe no bastard
Because I looked in the mirror
And I said: I bastard I can
You might also like I told myself: I bastard I can
And I said: I bastard I can
I still tell myself: I bastard I can

The good takes
Quiet consciousness is a weapon
Stop strong, steep calmly
Do not sell your soul

If the one next to fall, I lift it
Whatever you are coming
And no matter how much
Of my people I still have the support

Lies hurt
The truth also hurts
You decide the way
What do you want to cross

Babrón told you that I was going to achieve it
How good it feels

Vilalo pa 'that does not tell it
Without believing the mere mere
That all are equal here
That all are made of leather
They saw me well dressed
And driving a new car
It was because I put eggs
It is not believed that this is luck

Years in this is that I carry
They don't see my time spend
Because I always renew

I started well indebted
Now I owe no bastard
Because I looked in the mirror
And I said: I bastard I can

And I said: I bastard I can
And I said: I bastard I can
I still tell myself: I bastard I can
