Never Be The One Lyrics[Intro]
Never be the one

[Verse 1]
We're making out in your Sprinter
Holding me close, it was winter
I put Tame Impala on, you said
You only knew one song
Travel the world just to see you
Smoking cigars at Lulu
All I got from that fight we had is the heart-shaped rocks still in my bag
[Pre-Chorus]
Always say we'll do it when we're older
But that day keeps getting
Closer, I don't want this to be
Over, I like the way you'll never be the one

[Chorus]
(Who got away)
Never be the one (Who had to stay)
Never be the one
Never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one (Who broke my heart)
I'm never gonna let (It get that far)
Never be the one
Never be the one

[Verse 2]
We need a knife for the tension
All of our friends keep mentioning
The way we love each other
But in what way, friends or lovers?

[Pre-Chorus]
Always say we'll do it when we're older
But that day keeps getting
Closer, I don't want this to be
Over, I like the way you'll never be the one
You might also like[Chorus]
(Who got away)
Never be the one (Who had to stay)
Never be the one
Never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one (Who broke my heart)
I'm never gonna let (It get that far)
Never be the one
Never be the one

[Bridge]
I can't hate you
So that's why I can't date you
I hate how it sounds
I never say never, but it's never for now

[Chorus]
(Who got away)
Never be the one (Who had to stay)
Never be the one
Never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one (Who broke my heart)
I'm never gonna let (It get that far)
Never be the one
Never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one (Who got away)
Never be the one (Who had to stay)
Never be the one (Never be the one)
Never be the one
Never be the oneEmbed
