Graveyard Lyrics[Intro]
You guys always hang around graveyards and scare people?
Hey we're just having a goof

[Verse 1: Boothlord]
More bitches, more weed, I'm desperate for sleep
Ice in my guts, in my lean, boy, now don't call police
Come get your girl from my sheets
20, 20, 20 dollars on me
We ballin', we shoppin' on you
You got a problem, it's true
Scheming with Duffel and Ghoul
Swear when I wake up, I'm blown
B catch a bone, and I'm ghost
My niggas get high when I roll (niggas get high when I roll)
Sandpaper love and I'm sick to my stomach
I forget it all when I roam
I'm so alone again
Tired of seeing these same fucking hoes again (Fuck)
I'm in that don't fuck with mode again
And no one can save me (Cannot)
[Verse 2: Louie Duffelbags]
I don't want a bitch, I just want a dad
Money's all I got, bitches all I had
Danger Boys the clique
I got some dirty pics on my phone
Your bitch is sippin' on some dicks when I'm home
Fuck all your shit, it can't move me
I'll fuck your girl, Halloweentown, you know thats shit's spooky
Who got the dro?
I'm at my home watching Disney original movies
Oh no, oh no, pop another pill
Hop into the future like Phil
You can come over late
I got plenty time to kill, I could cop another feel
When you look at me oh what do you see?
I see the diamonds and I see the green
All of these bitches, they dying to see
Yung Ghoul in the graveyard dying with me

[verse 3: Yung Ghoul]
I feel like the Earth
Shout-out to Duffelbags, puffing that purp
Don't care what I'm worth
Zeros on zeros, it's all 'bout that work
Slanging that schythe, man, go 'head get murked
You know we just jerks
Shout-out to her
Diamonds and Benjis, she valued like myrrh
We scary like villains, the graveyard we killin'
I'm straight with the ignance, I'm ghost
Let's have a toast to those who ain't made it
I'm so fucking faded
Jaded and later your girl missed you straight up like Neo, the Matrix
I'm gone, Netflix and chill, nah man
It's all about that gone green lawn
Halfway to heaven, I'm quiet like reverend
Reverend that Cherokee, look down on peasants
I'm not really reverend, don't fucking step up
We're from the burbs, but we sway like gorillas
Goodbye from the night man, Danger gone skrill up
We know couple killas, my lungs 'bout to fill up
