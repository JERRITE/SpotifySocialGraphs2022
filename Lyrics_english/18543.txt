Sheâ€™s the Blade Lyrics[Intro]
(1, 2, 3, 4!)

[Verse 1]
Don't you make a move tonight
You can only stagger
Once she's got you in her sight
You're the one she's after

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid 'cause she's got closer
You're back stepping and she's back stabbing
Everything in your life
[Chorus]
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

[Post-Chorus]
(Go!)

[Verse 2]
One by one you count the fights
Doesn't even matter
That she's got you by surprise
Misery's your master

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid 'cause she's got closer
You're back stepping and she's out wrecking
Everything in your life

[Chorus]
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
You might also like[Bridge]
She stole everything, she controlled everything
She stole everything, she controlled everything
She's the blade
She's the blade
She's the blade and you're just paper
She's the blade and you're just...
'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid 'cause she's got you closer

[Chorus]
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

[Outro]
She stole everything, she controlled everything
She stole everything and controlled everythingEmbed
