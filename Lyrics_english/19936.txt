CUTTHROAT SMILE Lyrics[Intro: Bexey (Music Video Version)]
Man, some days I
Don't even wanna speak
Don't wanna hear, don't wanna think
Or see none of that
RYZE

[Hook: Bexey]
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear
[Verse 1: Bexey]
Take me back
Shades of black
So you really know that my pain is trapped
Anchored thoughts brain impact
Bitch, I need a bulletproof sailor’s cap
Cut-throat smile
Sweeney Todd style
Only ring you if she made the wrong dial
Fuck her for a long while, real wild
The look upon her face telling me she’s all mine
See the blood dripping straight from her fingers, kinda like Mallick from Saw 5
I’m telling her
Baby be careful, got a razor jawline
Hundred people around me, surrounded
But I’m still alone like Fortnite

[Refrain: Bexey]
Solo, so alone
Solo (shut the lights off)
Solo, so alone
(Cut the sound out)

[Hook: Bexey]
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear

Bitch, I’m Ruby Soho
I choose to be solo
Yeah $lick in the kitchen
He keep wishing for smoke
Bitch, soon to be rolled though
Ho, I fucking hope so
Spend most my dough choking
On whatever ‘codone
Pull up in a motherfuckin' four-door
Oh no, here come all the photos
Flashing, I'm snatching the camera right out of your hand
Grab the strap and then smash it on your dome, bro
Leave me the fuck alone
I swear I’m sick of all the slow-mo
$lick know I’m a no-show, busy ducking from a photo

[Hook: Bexey]
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear
[Verse 3: $crim]
Cut the lights off bitch, since the jits been off kits
Deliver a brick to Mr. I don’t know what his name is
You the lamest, record label problems, really got the stainless
44. bulldog in a sweaty leash
I get money while I Gleesh walk, while I eat
While I sleep, still I creep, gorilla east
If you don’t believe come and, come and try me
Don’t want a fucking thing
Dark voices whispering: "Kill them"

[Hook: Bexey]
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear
Shut the lights off bitch, I don’t wanna see a thing
Cut the sound out baby, I don’t wanna hear shit
Turn my mind off quick, I don’t even wanna think
How did I get here? Take me back, disappear15Embed
