Shut the World Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're moving backwards
We're slumbering in ashes
We're getting closer
Tomorrow isn't far away
It's an illusion
I know we
Both know it
But we refuse to refuse it

[Chorus]
As long as we can see when we close our eyes
We'll shut the world out
As long as we still hear when we close our ears
It's real for us
It is real for us
We'll shut the world out
[Verse 2]
Under the surface
We hide from the city
Everything's silent
The noises slowly faded out
Twenty feet deep in the ocean, we're rising
Turning the circles to runways

[Chorus]
As long as we can see when we close our eyes
We'll shut the world out
As long as we still hear when we close our ears
It's real for us
It is real for us
We'll shut the world out

[Refrain]
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up

[Outro]
We'll shut the world outYou might also likeEmbed
