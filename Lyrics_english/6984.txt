Wild Side (Extended Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Normani]
I'm ready to pull up on you
I'm ready to do what I do
Baby, what you wanna do?
Shoot your shot, 'cause I'm bulletproof (Yeah)
Load it up and doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo)
Baby, what you wanna do? (Do, do, do, do)
I'm ready to pull up on you (You, you, you, you)
I'm ready to do what I do (Do, do, do, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
This type of shit have you wildin' (Ooh)
Last minute trips to the islands (Ooh)
Drip, drip, drip, when you slide in (Ooh)
Fit, fit, fit, baby, right in (Ooh)
Don't hesitate when you (Ooh)
In it, 'cause you know I like it (Ooh)
Baking up a cake for you (Ooh)
Sweet, baby, like it when you bite it
[Chorus: Normani]
We can't just keep talkin' about it
We think too often about it
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

[Verse 2: Normani]
I wanna drive you crazy (Crazy)
Pull up inside me, baby (Boy)
Fuckin' it up like oopsie-daisy
Ain't no "If, ands, buts and maybes"
Don't be laid up in that shit likе you lazy
I need you to roll up in that shit like you're skatin'
Baby, ain't no hold up
I'm that shit, I hate waitin', doo-doo-doo
Shoot your shot, I'm impatiеnt (Doo-doo-doo, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
This type of shit have you wildin' (Ooh)
Last minute trips to the islands (Ooh)
Drip, drip, drip, when you slide in (Ooh)
Fit, fit, fit, baby, right in (Ooh)
Don't hesitate when you (Ooh)
In it, 'cause you know I like it (Ooh)
Baking up a cake for you (Ooh)
Sweet, baby, like it when you bite it

We can't just keep talkin' about it

[Bridge: Normani]
Oh yeah, you know you're right on time
Baby, bring it to me how I like
Know I need it more than just one time, two times, a few times
You know that I need it from you, baby, right on time
Baby, bring it to me how I like
I'm puttin' in overtime and overdrive to you
Oh yeah, you know you're right on time
Baby, bring it to me how I like
Know I need it more than just one time, two times, a few times
You know that I need it from you, baby, right on time
Baby, bring it to me how I like
I'm puttin' in overtime and overdrive to you

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Dímelo, turn me 'round
Treat me like a watch, bust me down
On the kitchen floor, right on that towel
It's my dick and I want it now, ow
Tell me how you want it
Put me on my back, on my stomach
Baby, let me blow it like a trumpet
I can do it all, I can prolly suck a watermelon through a straw
Believe me, every other day, new wig, new hair
Come take me out this Mugler
I'd be waitin' on you with some lingerie
Drive this pussy down low like bombs away
Boom, nothin' but a robe in your house
I wanna put these pretty pink toes in your mouth
Send nudes to your phone while you workin'
Boy, you gotta see this shit in person, believe me
[Chorus: Normani]
We can't just keep talkin' about it
We think too often about it
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

[Outro: Normani & Starrah]
Pull up in a err, mmm, Benz
Make me say, "Ah," baby, do that shit again
Ooh, yeah
Pull up in a mmm-mmm, drop
Ha-ha-ha, yeah, I'm makin' shit hot
Ooh, yeah
Pull up in a err, mmm, Benz
Make me say, "Ah," baby, do that shit again
Ooh, yeah (Ah)
Pull up in a mmm-mmm, drop
Ha-ha-ha, yeah, I'm makin' shit hot
Ooh, yeah2Embed
