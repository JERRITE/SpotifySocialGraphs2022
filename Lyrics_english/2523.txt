Loveless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crosses in the distance, bells ring fast
Loveless in our shelter, time will pass
Would you take a chance on us?
Could you take a chance on us?

[Verse 2]
Call out to the lonely with regrets
Loveless is your answer, time will pass
Couldn’t take a chance on us
Couldn’t take a chance on us
[Chorus]
Take my hand
In belief we trace our steps
Understand
No relief in silhouettes

[Bridge]
Battled myself so many times
What I was, isn’t what I want now
We can seek denial and search for miles
Blessed love, the love I need
Rolling drums, the loveless bleed
Blessed love, the love I need
Rolling drums, the loveless bleed

[Chorus]
Take my hand
In belief we trace our steps
Understand
No relief in silhouettesYou might also like2Embed
