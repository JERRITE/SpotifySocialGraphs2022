Wonâ€™t Keep Me Up At Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, well next time I see fall
I'll be everywhere
Oh, and when I leave you all
I thought I wouldn't care
A blank and lonely stare
Is what will take me there
Ehh ehh ehh

[Verse 2]
Oh, and when I see you try
Just know that I won't mind
Oh, won't keep away my time
Won't keep away what's right
[Bridge]
Won't keep me up at night
Well maybe that's a lie
Ah ah ah ah

[Chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh
Rely on the ones that know you
Ohhhhhhhh
Just don't ever let them know you
Ohhhhhhhh
You can show anything you want to
Ohhhhhhhh
You can guess, you can guess
You can guess, you can guess
But I won't, but I won't
Uhuhuh

[Verse 3]
Oh, well now it's been a year
And not too much has changed
Oh, I'm still a bit in fear
I'm still a bit insane
Only now I'm a bit drained
Only now I'm a bit drained
Ehh ehh ehh
You might also like[Chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh
Rely on the ones that know you
Ohhhhhhhh
Just don't ever let them know you
Ohhhhhhhh
You can show anything you want to
Ohhhhhhhh
You can guess, you can guess
You can guess, you can guess
But I won't, but I won't
UhuhuhEmbed
