Lose Our Minds Lyrics[Intro]
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds

[Verse 1]
We held a fire within us
A longing inside our souls
We held our breath and we dove in
To a world that had been so cold
[Pre-Chorus]
We've been awake for awhile
It's written in our bones
Hidden underneath our skin
I speak for everyone
Open my heart and say, "Go"
We've been running through the city
We've been following the bass
Hoping they won't find us
But we won't shy away
We're not flatfoot on the pavement
Nor we counting down the days, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause the day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds

[Post-Chorus]
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds

[Verse 2]
We saw the light in our shadows
The color inside our souls
We were out in the open
In the wild, we found our home
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We've been awake for a while
It's written in our bones
Hidden underneath our skin
I speak for everyone
Open my heart and say, "Go," oh
We've been running through the city
We've been following the bass
Hoping they won't find us
But we won't shy away
We're not flatfoot on the pavement
Nor we counting down the days, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause the day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds
We lose our minds

[Post-Chorus]
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds
We lose our minds, our minds, our minds, our minds
[Outro]
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our minds
The day we change our minds for you
Is the day we lose our mindsEmbed
