â€‹make you feel pretty Lyrics[Verse 1]
Over on the corner of Sunset and Doheny
Up the stairs at On The Rox
That's just where she left me waiting
Waiting, so she could get high (high, high, high, high)
She doesn't do it often, only every weekend
Sometimes on a Tuesday
When she don't really feel like sleeping
Sleeping, through the night (high, high, high, high)

[Chorus]
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous? That's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
[Verse 2]
You sound like you're from London, I know you're from Ohio
What have I been drinking and what the fuck do I know lately Lately, I'm out of my mind (high, high, high, high)
Oh, I could use a Xanax, maybe that'll fix this
She's like an addiction, something I ain't kickin' easy, easy
Am I wasting my time? (high, high, high, high)

[Chorus]
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous? That's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty

[Bridge]
Oh my God, my life is such a mess
Oh my God, I think that I need some rest

[Verse 3]
She moved in my apartment, now I don't sleep often
Drinking this concoction, have I really lost it?
Maybe, maybe I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
The sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous? That's fine
Spending all my money just to make you feel pretty
You might also like[Outro]
Don't wanna be nameless for life
You wanna be famous? That's fine
I'm spending all my money just to make you feel pretty3Embed
