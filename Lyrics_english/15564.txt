Beautiful betrayal lyrics ["Bella betrayal" letter]]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to hear it again
My soul is split in two for you
I don't care about the fire in which I burn today
They say I'm sick with love
That I get up and fall again for you
Every time you appear in front of me

[Chorus]
Because without you there is no way
Nor destiny, I'm lost
Because without you I don't care
The minutes or the days
Because without you there is no present
Nor future, save me
Of this beautiful betrayal
Who killed my reason (who killed my reason)
[Verse 2]
Forgive if I forget you
I'm sorry if I exhausted the illusion
I don't care about the oath I gave you
They tell me that your love ended
That you are only a song of yesterday
A sigh that stayed in the air

[Chorus]
Because without you there is no way
Nor destiny, I'm lost
Because without you I don't care
The minutes or the days
Because without you there is no present
Nor future, save me
Of this beautiful betrayal
Who killed my reason (who killed my reason)

[Bridge]
Where will you be
When my lips look for you?
And where will it be
The dream so sweet that
Was it of the two?
You were my beautiful betrayal
You were my beautiful betrayal

Because without you there is no way
Nor destiny, I'm lost
Because without you I don't care
The minutes or the days
Because without you there is no present
Nor future, save me

Of this beautiful betrayal
Of this beautiful betrayal
Of this beautiful betrayal
That killed my reason
(You were you, only you)
That killed my reason3embed
