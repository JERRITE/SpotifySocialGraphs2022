The Silence (New Single Mix) Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You lift me up then knock me down
I'm never sure just what to feel when you're around
I speak my heart, but don't know why
'Cause you don't ever really say what's on you mind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
I wanna know, but I don't wanna ask
[Chorus]
So say you love me or say you'll leave me
Don't let the silence do the talking
Just say you want me or you don't need me
Don't let the silence do the talking

[Verse 2]
You let me in, but then sometimes
Your empty eyes just make me feel so cold inside
When I'm with you, it's like rolling dice
Don't know when or how you're gonna make me cry

[Chorus]
So say you love me (Say you love me) or say you'll leave me (Say you'll leave me)
Don't let the silence do the talking
Just say you want me (Say you want me) or you don't need me (You don't need me)
Don't let the silence do the talking

[Post-Chorus]
It's killing me (The silence)
It's killing me (The silence, the silence)
Ooh, ooh (The silence)

[Bridge]
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
If it's the end then please just make it fast
You might also like[Chorus]
So say you love me (Say you love me) or say you'll leave me (Say you'll leave me)
Don't let the silence do the talking
Just say you want me (Say you want me) or you don't need me (You don't need me)
Don't let the silence do the talking

[Post-Chorus]
The silence, the silence (Ooh, yeah), the silence
The silence (Ooh), the silence, the silence
The silence, the silence

[Outro]
You lift me up then knock me down
I'm never sure just what to feel when you're aroundEmbed
