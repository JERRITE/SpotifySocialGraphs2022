[Verse 1]
She has something that catches me
It is very easy for me to miss it (OH)
I don't believe in love
In his round game I fell, and I fell in love
[Pre-car]
Ignora (OH)
Without touch
I see her dance, I don't leave her alone, alone
I want to do my lady
She is lovely and hunter (OH-OH)
Without touch
I see her dance, I don't leave her alone, alone
I want to do my lady
She is lovely and hunter (woh, oh, oh, oh)

Na, na, naeh, eh-eh (woh, oh, oh, oh, oh; my beloved; hahaha; woh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Baby, you have something, something very different
Let me meet you thoroughly, more intimately (EH)
Because when you move sexy, mommy (ouh, woh)
You provoke me and I want me more (Yey, Yeh-eh)
To pull your hair, and kiss you around the neck
Oh, you are not afraid, take off your clothes (OH)
Take it up by step and kiss me your mouth
Let's enjoy this moment (EH)
