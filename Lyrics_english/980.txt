Lloras (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics of "Lloras (Remix)"]

[Intro: Lenny Tavárez & Jay Wheeler]
That bastard that wrapped your life
Now it's your turn to change

[Pre-Boro: Lenny Tavárez, Cauty & Jay Wheeler]
It has been getting drugs (Yeah)
And he still doesn't forget what he feels (OH-OH-OH)
Like a fool thinking that (Yeah)
For a bastard his life will change
You did not fail and so they pay you (you pay you)
You gave everything and you stayed with nothing
You already have another one in a week
And you lying on your bed (-Ma)
Thinking you're not enough
[Chorus: Cauty]
I don't know why you cry (you cry)
You do not ere 'the culprit and to suffer better stay alone (alone)
That you do not ere 'the culprit and to suffer better
Go to drink, forget it (-He)
Go to drink, that you do not ere the culprit, baby

[Verse 1: Lenny Tavárez]
Love is a magic said Tito (rrra)
But not with that guy
It is single, and 'official (-Icial, -Icial)
There is time to recover (now)
So have my phone number
If you like the 'exotic' dust ', yeah (ah)
Sensual, baby, my Lollipop (Skrt)
Say that you are already (no-oh-oh)

[Bridge 1: Lenny Tavárez & Cauty]
That bastard that bitter your life (ah)
I don't know what still 'suffering (ah-ah)
I saw you for the lost disco
Give me your number, which shit is' eating (Cauty, Cauty)

[Verse 2: Cauty]
I haven't seen you
Single, hand up, he 'is doing so
Pass another cup because today e 'your day, heh
Calm, hesitate that you gave everything
And that bastard failed you
He doesn't know what he lost
GRILE "GOOD BYE, Goodbye"
Don't feel alone, that's better

I don't know why he cries (cries)

Go to drink, that you do not ere the culprit, baby

[Verse 3: Jay Wheeler & Noriel]
Stop thinking
What to cry will heal you
If time has passed
Now it's your turn to change

Because being wrong to accompany ', baby, better stay alone
The only thing I want from you now (tell him)

That by a asshole does not cry (wuh)
The one who leaves without being bounds, returns without calling him (now)
Never leave a bastard to control you or claim you (no)
Baby, life e 'one, forget to defame you (wuh)
The one who Meno 'can or the one who Meno' knows (Ah?) Always (Ah?)

It will hurt to leave you (you don't hurt ')
And although it still hurts
You can't 'cry more' for that unhappy (Wuh!)
[Verse 5: Alex Rose]
Go, salt for the street, Ponte Bonita (ey)
There is probably someone waiting for you
As you are not many, self-esteem goes up (-Tima)
I am one of those who lives wanting you, Yeah
To that fool
Tell him that in your heart no longer commands
Who already knows 'to' his 'trick', huh
The 'mesajito' with Amanda
Leave to text if it is' single, hey
The bad vibrates take it out for
Whatever in your wallet
Go out to break the road

[Bridge 2: Alex Rose]
It's time to meet you
Not anyone can have you, huh (ah)
There the one who runs luckily

[Chorus: Alex Rose & Cauty]
I don't know why he cries (cries)
You are not the culprit and pay better stay alone (alone)
That you are not the culprit and pay better
Go to drink (go drink), forget it
Go to drink, that you do not ere the culprit, baby
