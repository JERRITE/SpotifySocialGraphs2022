No Eyes on Me Lyrics[bridge]
Homie I give no fucks
You don’t want problems, trust me
Go ahead if you must
But your bitch can’t un-fuck me
I know you might think it’s lust
But really I think she love me
I know you might think you tough
I go too HAM can't touch me

[HOOK]
No eyes on me
They don’t wanna see no dubs
No eyes on me
They don’t wanna see no love
No eyes on me
They just wanna see what was
Take a look what you
Take a look what you
Take a look what you done
[post hook]
They show no love for me
They think that it’s done for me
Now they wanna come for me
Make they bitches cum to me
I been livin comfortably
Cool if you don’t fuck with me
But whеn you down, don’t run to me
All you boys look dumb to me
It’s fun to be, mysеlf

[VERSE]
After all the pain that you dealt
It’s still not a thing that I felt
It’s no beef, I’m wishing you well
I got this ice box, but it melt
I feel like hell
I’m way too hot, if you can’t tell
You think I’m not
I think you swell
I know you want
To see me fail
But you forgot
I fell by the wayside
Got back up
I just had to take time
I love my life
But know you hate mine
I know I lost
But it’s no debate I’m
Back & better
I’m well developed
Got my act together
You see I’m cheesing
I be stacking cheddar
I make it rain
Like I, smacked the weather
That bitch is bad
So I had to get her

Homie I give no fucks
You don’t want problems, trust me
Go ahead if you must
But your bitch can’t un-fuck me
I know you might think it’s lust
But really I think she love me
I know you might think you tough
I go too HAM can't touch me

[HOOK]
No eyes on me
They don’t wanna see no dubs
No eyes on me
They don’t wanna see no love
No eyes on me
They just wanna see what was
Take a look what you
Take a look what you
Take a look what you done

[post hook]
They show no love for me
They think that it’s done for me
Now they wanna come for me
Make they bitches cum to me
I been livin comfortably
Cool if you don’t fuck with me
But when you down, don’t run to me
All you boys look dumb to me
It’s fun to be, myselfEmbed
