I Wanna Know You Lyrics[Intro: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta]
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh (Whoa)
Whoa, oh

[Verse 1: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta]
When I saw you over there, I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere, I wanna know you
Gonna guess that you're the kind to say what's on your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you
There's a mark above your eye, you got it in July
Fightin' for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names and valentines are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion, oh
[Chorus: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta, Hannah Montana]
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna know you
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, "Yeah, I thought so"

[Verse 2: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta, Hannah Montana]
You smile, never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong
You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination (Yeah)

[Chorus: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta, Hannah Montana, David Archuleta]
Whoa, whoa, oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa, oh, I wanna know you
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself (Yeah)
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself, "Yeah, I thought so"

I thought so, ooh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (Whoa, whoa, oh)
Yeah (Whoa, oh)
I wanna know you
Yeah (Whoa, whoa, oh)
Yeah (Whoa, oh)

[Chorus: Hannah Montana & David Archuleta, Hannah Montana, David Archuleta]
I wanna go there where you go (Where you go)
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road (I wanna know you)
I'll sit back and say to myself (Ooh, yeah)
I like how you are with me (Yeah)
In our future history (Yeah)
And maybe someday down the road (Yeah)
I'll sit back and say to myself (Yeah)
"Yeah, I thought so"3Embed
