Think About Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't think that we
Could ever be friends again
'Cause our history
Seems like it never ends
[Pre-Chorus]
Who's gonna make love like I do?
Yeah, nobody
And who knows your touch like I do?
Yeah, nobody
And who's gonna make sure that you come first in everything they do?
Everything you do, I want you to tell the fuckin' truth
[Chorus]
I know you still think about me
I know you still think about me
Way up there all alone
Yeah, I bet they'll never know
I know you still think about me
How could you not think about me?
Way up there all alone
The best that you've ever known
I know you still
I know you still think about me
Do you not think about me?
You're gonna think about me

[Verse 2]
Don't think that we
Could ever be just platonic
And is it just me
Or would that be too ironic?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, who gonna fuck like I do?
Yeah, nobody
And who knows your touch like I do?
Yeah, nobody
And who's gonna make sure that you come first in everything they do?
Everything you do, I want you to tell the fuckin' truth
You might also like[Chorus]
I know you still think about me
I know you still think about me
Way up there all alone
Yeah, I bet they'll never know
I know you still think about me
How could you not think about me?
Way up there all alone
The best that you've ever known
I know you still
I know you still think about me
Do you not think about me?
You're gonna think about me18Embed
