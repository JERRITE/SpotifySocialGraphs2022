Partycrasher Lyrics[Intro]
You knew that I was crazy when you fell in love with me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah

[Verse 1]
You say I'm a psycho
You tell me that we might go up in flames
Tell me somethin' that I don't know
I don't pay attention anyway
Might go out and get arrested
I'm not really twenty-one
Blame it on my adolesence
Fucking up is too much fun
[Chorus]
I'm not sorry that I crashed your party
When I crashed my car in your parents' yard
And passed out on Sunset Boulevard
I'm not evil, but my love is lethal
The truth hurts sometimes, but honestly
You knew that I was crazy when you fell in love with me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah (You knеw that I was crazy when you fell in love with mе)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah

[Verse 2]
Never been an angel
Never had a halo on my head
Stop tellin' me to lay low
Baby, I can sleep when I'm dead
Mixin' liquor with depression
Isn't good for anyone
Blame it on my adolesence
Fucking up is too much fun

[Chorus]
I'm not sorry that I crashed your party
When I crashed my car in your parents' yard
And passed out on Sunset Boulevard
I'm not evil, but my love is lethal
The truth hurts sometimes, but honestly
You knew that I was crazy when you fell in love with me

Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah

[Bridge]
Blacked out, broken bottles
Every night's like Friday night
They say what I got problems, I don't really mind
Blacked out, broken bottles
Every night's like Friday night
They say I got problems
Welcome to my life (Welcome to my life)

[Chorus]
I'm not sorry that I crashed your party
When I crashed my car in your parents' yard
And passed out on Sunset Boulevard
I'm not evil, but my love is lethal
The truth hurts sometimes, but honestly
You knew that I was crazy when you fell in love with me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah (You knew that I was crazy when you fell in love with me)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah1Embed
