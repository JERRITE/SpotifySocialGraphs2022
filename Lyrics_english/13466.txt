Keep Us Apart LyricsSay nothing's gonna keep us apart
My body gotta be where you are
You are

I say nothing's gonna keep us apart
I listen to my body
Baby ain't nobody gonna keep us apart

Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
I thought I told no more
I swear I really meant it babe
I was so passive I was so naked
Lying in my bed it came

I thought I told no more
I swear I really meant it babe
Thought I really meant it babe

Say nothing's gonna keep us apart
My body gotta be where you are
You are
I say nothing's gonna keep us apart
I listen to my body
Baby ain't nobody gonna keep us apart

Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Listen to my body
Baby ain't no nobody gonna keep us apart

I thought I told no more
I swear I really meant it babe
I was so passive I was so naked
Lying in my bed it came
You might also likeI thought I told no more
I swear I really meant it babe
Thought I really meant it babe

Say nothing's gonna keep us apart
My body gotta be where you are
You are
I say nothing's gonna keep us apart
I listen to my body
Baby ain't nobody gonna keep us apart

Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart
Gon' keep us apart

Listen to my body
Baby ain't no nobody gonna keep us apart
Listen to my body
Baby ain't no nobody gonna keep us apart
Keep us apart
Keep us apartEmbed
