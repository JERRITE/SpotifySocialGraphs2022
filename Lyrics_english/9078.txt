Love Is For Suckers LyricsYou saw me comin', you had my number
But you don't want me, could you be dumber
Your eyes are flashin', your lips are willing
But I'm a patsy for the killing
You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
You think that I'd do most anything

[Chorus]
Love is for dreamers
Love is for believers
Love is for losers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers
Listen, I'm not some poor fool, won't jump through your hoop
Ain't gonna crawl, girl, to that I won't stoop
So if you want me, you'll have to get me
And if you're willing, I'll be ready
You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
To me that just don't mean anything

[Chorus]
Love is for dreamers
Love is for believers
Love is for losers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers

Listen, well, well, well, if it isn't little miss perfect
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
You wanna get back together? You do, huh?
Well, listen honey, I'm just not interested
You'll what? You will? With your heels on?
Oh no, come on, babe, let's go
Here I go again

(Solo - Eddie)

You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
You know that I'll do most anything
You might also like[Chorus]
Love is for dreamers
Love is for believers
Love is for losers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers
Love is for suckers

Listen, love is for suckers
Love is for suckers
Sucker fight me, sucker fight you (love is for suckers)
Always be suckers and do most anything
I wanna be a sucker (love is for suckers)
I'm a sucker, you're a sucker
He's a sucker, she's a sucker (love is for suckers)
Would you like to be a sucker, to be a sucker?
Love is for suckers, yeah, yeah
