You lie so well lyrics [lyrics by "you lie so well"]

[Verse 1]
That you will stay with me a whole life
What with you: Goodbye winters, only spring
That the waves are of magic and not of salt water
I believe you everything and you don't give me anything, you don't give me anything

[Verse 2]
That if I follow your way I will get to heaven
You lie to me in my face and I get blind
I swallow your words, you play a game
And the world shines when you say: "Then"
When you say "later"
[Pre-car]
When you say: "I feel, I feel that you are everything"
When you say: "Life, I will be with you"
You take my hand and inside I cry
Even if it's a lie, you make me feel alive
Although air is false, I feel I breathe

[Chorus]
You lie so well
That does everything you give me really give me
And I'm already loving you
You lie so well
I have come to imagine that in my love you fill your skin
And although everything is paper, MHM, you lie so well

[Pre-car]
When you say: "I feel, I feel that you are everything"
When you say: "Life, I will be with you"
You take my hand and inside I cry
Even if it's a lie, you make me feel alive
Although air is false, I feel I breathe

[Chorus]
You lie so well
That does everything you give me really give me
And I'm already loving you
You lie so well
I have come to imagine that in my love you fill your skin
And although everything is paper, you lie so well
