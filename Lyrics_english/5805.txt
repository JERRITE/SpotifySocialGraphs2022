I'm a, I’m a, I'm a, I'm a, I’m a, I'm a (One, two, three, four)
I'm a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Livin' so loud, you could never hear me cry, nay-ay
See no tears run down my eyes (Run down my eyes)
Oh, these hills, they burn so bright (They burn so bright)
Oh, these hills, they bring me life (Bring me life)
Oh, these hills, baby, oh, these hills, baby, mmm (I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I’m a, I’m a, I'm a)

[Verse 1: Joji]
I’m a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Poppin' blue pills and sippin' on finest, nay-ay (Brrt)
No more fears and no more lies
I tell myself to sleep at night (Sleep at night)
Amongst these hills, baby (Oh, these hills, baby)
Amongst these hills, baby (I’m a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)
[Break: Joji]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey (Bitch), hey, hey (Suck my nuts)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Handsome young man, never pull up on time
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' good should be a crime, crime
All this pain I'll never let show (No)
My real thoughts, you'll never know (No)
Never know (No, no), never know (No, no, no)
Handsome young man, never worried 'bout time
Flexin' on the 'net, it's the same offline (Offline), ay-ay (Offline)
If I don't lead, where will they go?
They follow my every move
Every move (Every move), every move, every move (Every move)

[Chorus: Joji]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a (Goddamnit, nice shot)
I'm a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Livin' so loud, you could never hear me cry, nay-ay
See no tears run down my eyes (Run down my eyes)
Oh, these hills, they burn so bright (They burn so bright)
Oh, these hills, they bring me life (Bring me life)
Oh, these hills, baby, oh, these hills, baby, mmm (I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)You might also like44Embed
