Into It Lyrics[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Yeah, I've been catching planes for the fun of it (Yuh)
Then I've been watching fame turn to punishment
The weather's only sunny when I'm under it (Yeah)
And I haven't really changed, yeah, I'm just confident (Woo)
I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it (Yeah)
A hundred million people couldn't deal with this
I've been trying to grow 'cause people kill for it (Yeah)
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit, ah (Woo)

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
But I'm into it, I'm into it (Woo)
Say she wanna fuck me later
Girl, I'm into it (Woo), I'm into it, I'm into it (Woo)
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit, ah
But I'm into it (Woo), I'm into it (Yeah)
I'm getting way too deep
I'm fucking into it
I'm into it, yeah, I'm into it
I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm fucking into it (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Christian Anthony & Mitchel Cave]
I've been on the road since I was sixteen (Yeah)
They don't really notice how I see things
These girls they come and go between my bed sheets (Yeah)
And I've been doing blue and causing big scenes, yeah
Pull up and I'm higher than the big trees, yeah
She don't really like it but she needs me, yeah
She saying she don't really miss me
But fuck it, now I'm faded off the wrong things, yeah

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
But I'm into it, I'm into it (Woo)
Say she wanna fuck me later
Girl, I'm into it (Woo), I'm into it, I'm into it (Woo)
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit, ah
But I'm into it (Woo), I'm into it (Yeah)
I'm getting way too deep
I'm fucking into it
I'm into it, yeah, I'm into it
I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm fucking into it (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Mitchel Cave]
Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it
Say she wanna fuck me later
Girl, I'm into it
I'm into it, I'm into itYou might also like37Embed
