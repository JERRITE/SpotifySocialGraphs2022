Hey Boy Lyrics[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
I wonder how you really feel about me
I love those feelings that you bottled, you should pour 'em on me
Baby, I can't believe you had to live a life without me
Come here and show me how you feel, I wanna see if it's real
[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe, baby)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)

[Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
'Cause we don't talk much, but you never forget me
And when I ain't around, I'm still in your sex dreams
Always on your mind, you could call it haunting
Papi, ven pa'ca and see this ass in person

[Outro: Omar Apollo]
Chop, slop, hopscotch
Trade on me, wanna fuck
Roll me up a little runtz
Homie, you gon' hit me up?You might also like3Embed
