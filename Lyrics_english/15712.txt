I wanted Lyrics ["I wanted" letter]

[Verse 1]
So many promises that go out today
And we don't even know why
Because love is dying, no
After the gate of that coffee
So many couples who love each other today
Dark in his fantasy
So many loves meet today
In all songs and poems
[Chorus]
I wanted to stop time with your eyes watching me
With the desire to stay like this, hugging you
And stop that moment every time you left
I wanted, yes, I wanted
I wanted to change the world, but the world is like it
How many desire to dig into your soul
I wanted to have you alone, and that you were forever mine
I wanted, yes, I wanted

[Verse 2]
So many moments that are missed today
Your smell, your laugh and your joy
Things happen and this is love
But I don't understand it, I don't accept it, no

[Chorus]
I wanted to stop time with your eyes watching me
With the desire to stay like this, hugging you
And stop that moment every time you left
I wanted, yes, I wanted
And I wanted, yes, I wanted
I wanted to have you alone, and that you were forever mine
I wanted, yes, I wanted

[Outro]
So many couples who love each other today
And I tonight without your amoyou might Also likembed
