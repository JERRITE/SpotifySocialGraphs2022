So Cold Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crowded streets all cleared away, one by one
Hollow heroes separate, as they run
You're so cold, keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

[Chorus]
Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try
[Verse 2]
If you find your family, don't you cry
In this land of make-believe, dead and dry
You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hand on me, one last time

[Chorus]
Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try

[Outro]
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all right
It’s all rightYou might also like7Embed
