When she loved me lyrics when someone loved me 
 I felt so happy 
 The moments we spent 
 I remember them well 

 Timber in your regret 
 I her tears drought 
 His joy I also shared 
 When he loved me 

 Station station 
 Between the two there were union 
 And Nadamas we as it should be 
 And if I was 
 I used to accompany her 
 So it was 
 When he loved me 

 Time passed, I am the same 
 More little by little I forgot 
 I was left alone 
 But I still hear 
 His voice saying 'I love you' 

 Forgotten was 
 When she found me 
 He held me before 
 Again smiled at me 

 Well, he loved me 
 If he loved me 
 When someone loved me 
 I felt so happy 
 The moments we spent 
 I remember them well 
 When I loved me Might Also Likeembed
