Home Sweet Home (feat. ALMA & Digital Farm Animals) - Thomas Nan Club Mix Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been a million different places
Don't know how I made it here
This city's full of famous faces
Don't know what they chasin'
Oh, it hurts to say goodbye
But I left what I left behind, yeah
If I'm gonna make it out alive
I gotta catch your train tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
Home sweet home
I'm coming back
It's been to long
[Post-Chorus]
Home sweet home
I'm dressed in black
Leave the light on

[Verse 2]
I've been a million different places
Don't know how I made it here
This city's full of fallen angels
Everybody's faded
My bags are packed and one foot at the door
Left to note on the floor, I'll be gone in the morning
Don't try to stop me, I've made up my mind
Yeah, I'm already on my way

[Chorus]
Home sweet home
I'm coming back
It's been to long

[Post-Chorus]
Home sweet home
I'm dressed in black
Leave the light on

[Outro]
Home sweet home
I'm coming back, it's been too long
