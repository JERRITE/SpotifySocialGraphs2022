Let me go lyricsletra "let me go" ft. Morat

[Verse 1: Andrés Cepeda]
When you stole my eyes and you didn't have permission
I understood that with a finger the sun is not covered
I underestimated your kisses caught your spell
For playing so much with fire I burned the heart

[Verse 2: Morat]
And although it was always in our plans to follow the libretto
Suddenly a kiss comes and it is time to improvise
I will blame your broken lips and slow dances
That we were not able to react
[Pre-Caro: Andrés Cepeda]
If it's for me it would force you to stay
But the wind today blows in your favor
And if it costs a life to catch you, don't do it worse

[Choir: Andrés Cepeda, Morat]
Let me go
Try your eyes to steal my breath
Forces your mouth to try to be far
Let me go
Order your hands not touch my door
It will be better if they do not find out that it is open
My heart will not endure if you don't let go
Let me go

[Verse 3: Andrés Cepeda, Andrés Cepeda & Morat]
And although I have writings so many plans to love me
I know it is true that love is a game of two
Because being your friend without breaking the rules
Today I would like to be honest it worked

[Pre-Caro: Andrés Cepeda]
If it's for me it would force you to stay
But the wind today blows in your favor
And if it costs a life to catch you, don't do it worse

Let me go
Try your eyes to steal my breath
Forces your mouth to try to be far
Let me go
Order your hands not touch my door
It will be better if they do not find out that it is open
My heart will not endure if you don't let go
Let me go

[Bridge: Andrés Cepeda, Morat]
Forget everything you know
Don't wait for me to miss you
I don't want you to come a single second to apologize
Forget everything you know
Don't wait for me to miss you
And delete each lyrics even if your song

[Outro: Andrés Cepeda, Morat, both]
Stay here
Let your eyes steal my breath
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Forces your mouth to never be far away
Stay here
Order your hands to touch my door
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It will be better when they find out that it is open
And although in the end I don't have all the answers
My heart will not endure if you release it
Stay hereembed
