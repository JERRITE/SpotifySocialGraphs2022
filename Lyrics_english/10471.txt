Galore - French Lyrics version [verse 1: Oklou & Apple] 
 If what I say is lost in silence 
 In spaces and blurring 
 Our hearts were in absences 
 Or in the mouth of the wolf 
 Each end of summer evenings 
 The stars are played out of us 
 (Oh, they are played out of us) 

 [Verse 2: apple] 
 I have left noise that we leave 
 So as not to go crazy 
 My eyes are ramparts that hurt you 
 I do not see anything at all 
 Each end of summer evenings 
 The stars are played out of us 
 Oh, they are played out 
 [Bridge: Oklou] 
 Ooh, if i knew at the time 
 If i knew at the time, mmm 

 [Outro: Apple] 
 Ooh, I'm not really there 
 Ooh, I'm not really there 
 Do not worry about me 
 Don't worry about Moiyou Might also Likeembed
