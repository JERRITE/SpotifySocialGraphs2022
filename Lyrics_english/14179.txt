Old Enough Lyrics[Verse 1]
You look pretty in your fancy dress
But I detect unhappiness
You never speak so I have to guess
You're not free

[Verse 2]
There, maybe when you're old enough
You'll realize that you're not so tough
And some days the seas get rough
And you'll see
[Verse 3]
You're too young to have it figured out
You think you know what you're talking about
You think it will all work itself out
But we'll see

[Bridge]
When I was young I thought I knew
You probably think you know too
Do you?
Well do you?

I was naive just like you
I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do
Well, what you gonna do?
(What a fool)

[Verse 4]
And how have you gotten by so far
Without having no visible scar?
No one knowing who you really are
They can't see

[Chorus]
What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
What you gonna do now
You might also likeWhat you gonna do (what you gonna do)
What you gonna do now

What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
What you gonna do now

What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
What you gonna do now
What you gonna do now

[Bridge]
The only way you'll ever learn a thing
Is to admit that you know absolutely nothing
Oh nothing
Think about this carefully
You might not get another chance to speak freely
Oh freely

[Outro]
Baby when you're old enough
Baby when you're old enough
Baby when you're old enough
You're not free
You're not free2Embed
