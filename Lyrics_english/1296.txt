TranslationsFran√ßaisWho You Are Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus]
Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard, to follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

[Post-Chorus]
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are

[Verse 2]
Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold, (yeah)
The more I try, the less it's working, (yeah, yeah)
'Cause everything inside me screams
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,) (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are
You might also like[Bridge]
Yes, no, egos, fake shows, like whoa
Just go and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, Good Love, Goodnight
With a smile, that's my home, (yeah, oh)
That's my home, (no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh)

[Chorus]
Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard, to follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are, (yeah-yeah)34Embed
