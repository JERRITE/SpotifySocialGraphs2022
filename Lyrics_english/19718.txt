Once In A While (Acoustic) LyricsYes, I have seen the things
It's unreasonable
Sometimes I found the things
It's understandable
You're not the only one
With mixed emotion
You are the only one
To share my real intention

* I'm gonna spend my life
Yes, gonna spend my life
Spend the rest of my life with you
I don't believe it till I see it
No, I don't believe it till I hear it
Assumption is the mother of all fXXked ups
But it's turned out to be awesome
Once in a while, oh!

* repeat
