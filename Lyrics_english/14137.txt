Miraculous Tales Of Ladybug & Cat Noir Theme Song Lyrics[Intro]
In the daytime, I'm Marinette
Just a normal girl with a normal life
But there's something about me that no one knows yet
Cause I have a secret

[Verse 1: Brittnee Belt]
Another day, I'm back at school
I think about him, he's so cool
He looks at me, I look away
But does he see me anyway?
[Pre-Chorus 1: Brittnee Belt]
Oh-oh-oh
HeÂ´s got me spinning around
Oh-oh-oh
My feet are off the ground
Oh-oh-oh
And when the sun goes down
That's when I become

[Chorus: Brittnee Belt]
Miraculous! Simply the best!
Up to the test when things go wrong!
Miraculous, the luckiest!
The power of love, always so strong!

[Verse 2: Cash Callaway]
I am a cat, just chilling out
But in the night, she's all I think about
I feel so strong when she's around
She picks me up when I am down

[Pre-Chorus: Cash Callaway & Brittnee Belt]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh no, you'll never know
Oh-oh-oh
My love can only grow
Oh-oh-oh
And when I see her smile
That's when she becomes
You might also like[Chorus: Brittnee Belt]
Miraculous, simply the best
Up to the test when things go wrong
Miraculous, the luckiest
The power of love, always so strong!

[Chorus: Brittnee Belt & Cash Callaway]
Miraculous!  Simply the best! (Oh oh)
Up to the test when things go wrong!
Miraculous, the luckiest! (Miraculous)
The power of love, always so strong

Miraculous! Simply the best! (Miraculous, you are the best)
Up to the test when things go wrong (Woah)
Miraculous, the luckiest!
The power of love, always so strong!

[Outro: Brittnee Belt & Cash Callaway]
