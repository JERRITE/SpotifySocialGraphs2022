TranslationsEnglishFrançaisALWAYS DO Lyrics[Chorus]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

[Verse 1]
I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same pain? (Pain, pain)
When the prеssure put on me, then I changе things
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place
[Pre-Chorus]
You-u-u-u-u, wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but
You always knew

[Chorus]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

[Post-Chorus]
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted
I'm about to fall, then you're all in
I'm not the one to solve your problems (No, no)
'Cause I'm fucked up too-oo-oo-oo-oo
