Lyrics drug loves ["drug love letter"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Falling in love is modern danger 
 It's not as before, they are already other times 
 I invented a thousand names 
 Faces and voices 

 [Chorus] 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 What a mess 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 What a mess 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 [Verse 2] 
 I'm going to tell you very short 
 That your neighbors hear us 
 Love is not fashionable 
 Fuck drug love 
 Fuck that shit 

 [Bridge] 
 Nobody taught me to love 
 Nobody taught me to love 
 Nobody taught me to love 

 [Chorus] 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 What a mess 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 What a mess 
 I was not born to fall in love 

 [Pre-car] 
 It is modern danger 
 It's not as before, they are already other times 
 I invented a thousand names 
 Faces and voices 

 [Instrumental]

 What a mess 
 I was not born to fall in love 

 [Outro] 
 I was not born to fall in love 
 I was not born to fall in love
