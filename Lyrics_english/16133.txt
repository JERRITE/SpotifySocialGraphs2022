The Phone Book Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm on watch here
So close your eyes and get some rest
I'm here to watch your heart
It's been faulty from the start
I'm the ribs in your chest

[Verse 2]
I'm not an angel
I never mean to make you cry
Jumping through my hoops
With dissension in the troops
And a smile and a sigh
[Pre-Chorus]
What's that over your shoulder?
Fear of getting older?

[Chorus]
Stay with me

[Verse 3]
Sing me a love song
From your heart or from the phone book
It don't matter to me
I'm an apple, you're the tree
I won't fall when you're shook

[Pre-Chorus]
What's that over your shoulder?
Fear of getting older?

[Chorus]
Stay with me

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

It ends with a kiss
It ends with a tear
It ends with the lights out
Bathed in our fear
Tell me nonsense
I don't want sincere
I saw the lightnin'
Cut through the last winter sky of the year

[Chorus]
Stay with me
Keep with me

[Outro]
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nahEmbed
