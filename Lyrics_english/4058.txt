Tell me daddy

Hey Dj Pex
I've been looking for an appointment with her for a long time
But I could not achieve it
So I talked to J-Alvarez
(J Alvarez)
Hey You, the owner of the system. The Rockie
(Roockie)
The maximum respect
(Alkilados)
And Nicky Jam

(Nicky Jam)
Quiet little brother
That we are going to conquer that woman

(Alkilados)
For helping me to fall in love

(Nicky Jam)
I spend the days, obsessed
Think that you don't even know me
Looking at your profile all night
Where am I going to stop?

If you leave with me, an adventure will give you
I will fall in love and the world will put at your feet

I don't know if you like it, help me fall in love
Tell him that I have already written a thousand songs
Let me give me an appointment
You Might Also Like (Alkilados)
I don't know if you like it, help me fall in love
Tell him that I have already written a thousand songs
Let me give me an appointment

(Roockie)
And I don't know why it will be
That you have me dead now
I only think of your face and your body
Sad is my reality
But I know that with a kiss
I am able to change your universe

(Alkilados)
I like you
From the first day I saw you
I like you
You have to be, you have to be for me
I like you
From the first day I saw you
I like you
You have to be, you have to be for me

(J Alvarez)
Miss, give me an appointment
I am the man you need
That he fell in love and her life happy
I will be waiting until you decide
Give me the opportunity, to your heart enter
Baby I will promise you, a life full of love
(Pure pure pure beach)
A life full of love
(Pure pure pure beach)
A life full of love

(Nicky Jam)
This is the remix

You toy 'looking for mamacita
Pa 'that you give me an appointment
You just tell me when and where and I arrive immediately
I look for you from you from you
Addicted to you to you

Someone help me
Grab me the woman who crashes me
I will not endure
I will not wait, his face falls in love with me more

(Alkilados)
I don't know if you like it, help me fall in love
Tell him that I have already written a thousand songs
Let me give me an appointment

(Nicky Jam)
I don't know if you like it, help me fall in love
Tell him that I have already written a thousand songs
Let me give me an appointment

(Alkilados)
I'm dying for your kisses and your heat
Baby I can't continue with this obsession
I like you so much and I can't stand
You are the reason why I sing

I like you
From the first day I saw you
I like you
You have to be, you have to be for me

(Roockie)
You don't know how long I've been watching you girl
I want to be the owner of your kisses
Let's go to an appointment and you will see it
That you will not regret

That's why I ask you to regal an appointment
Where are we alone when you want to let me know
I will never say no if one day you need me
You are the priority of my list

(Alkilados, Nicky Jam and J-Alvarez)
I don't know if you like it, help me fall in love
Tell him that I have already written a thousand songs
Let me give me an appointment

(J Alvarez)
I have been so difficult for me to explain
And I don't have more songs to dedicate
Is that I like everything she has
If an opportunity gives me
I under the stars

(Alkilados)
I like you
From the first day I saw you
I like you
You have to be, you have to be for me
