Lyrics love tourist [see 1]
I was the accident of your heart
The open door that a thief would leave
That ends your mission
And you don't care poisoning
That is left after your cruel connection
What a poetic acting

[Pre-chorus]
I don't know what I am
I just feel like someone so distorted
I no longer have place
I have done everything, all for always being by your side
Don't tell me anymore
[Chorus]
I am a tourist of love
When I stay inside you
You will always be my worst mistake
And of my silences the author
Let me go

[See 2]
It is not natural you do not seem mortal
And I submit to your existential fault
I am your provisional love

[Pre-chorus]
I don't know what I am
I just feel like someone so distorted
Don't tell me anymore

[Chorus] (x2)
I am a tourist of love
When I stay inside you
You will always be my worst mistake
And of my silences the author

[Bridge]
You're my worship
Return me what I lost with you
Open your heart
Stop being an imposter with me
You Might Also Like [Chorus]
I am a tourist of love
When I stay inside you
You will always be my worst mistake
And of my silences the author
Let me go

Let me go
Let me go ... embed
