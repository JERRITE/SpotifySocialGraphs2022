Scave with me (Remix) Lyrics [Scap yourself with me (remix) ft. Ozuna, Bad Bunny, from La Ghetto, Arcángel, Noriel & Almighty]

[Intro: Bad Bunny, Wisin, De la Ghetto]
You can only spend every 10 years in music every 10 years
I need to see you (OH-OH-OH-OH)
Double U
It will be the magic that your eyes have
And those tricks to fall in love
You seduce me at will
And I can't escape from your spell (from the ghetto)
What do I want to look for you
And to kiss you again
As much as they try to get away
Baby, with me you're leaving
(You have to be brave, baby)
[Chorus: Ozuna]
Scave with me tonight, baby
I want to eat you (UOH-OH-OH), you will love it (you will love it)
You know that you always have a good time (you always pass it well)
I want to eat you, your lips kiss

[Post-Coro: Wisin, Ozuna, Bad Bunny]
Baby, don't say no, oh
If we are only you, oh
And your skin brings
When we get into heat
Baby, don't say no (no, no, no)
If we are only you and me
If your skin bristles
When we get into heat (Bad Bunny, Baby; Bad Bunny)

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny, Wisin]
I want me to escape '(escape')
Your best friend you tape (tape)
Tell me what bottle you want to uncover (Wouh!)
No condon, with you I'm going to
I like your little thing when he beats (beat)
Pa 'ti I don't have a phillie, I have a bat (wouh)
With the short for your jevo or try (Wouh!)
If he asks tell me that I am your four, Yeh
With me on Sundays they are in Palomino (Yeh)
Champagne bottles or wine glasses (Wouh!)
Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci or Valentino (Yeh)
Alexander McQueen or Moschino (Wouh)
I like to see you in four, do not turn off the light (no)
That today I will take the juice like a bubbaloo
Your jevo is late, it looks like a Razer with Bluetooth
Well, don't please you, you said that (ok, good night to all)

I want you to escape (heh)
And that with kisses you kill me
That with caresses me mistreat (imagine)
The magnate (hard), within a yacht (EH)
And you dancing chocolate soaked
GIVE IT BABY, MAKE THE DECISION
And only squeeze the button (brave)
You know, that of seduction (I want you to relax)
High percent of passion
Bring me the oil for massage and the tension went
Don't be afraid, I touch you because I can (hard)
Something happens to me when I get tangled up (something very crazy)
He sucks my fingers and I didn't go back
You tell me if we escape and proceed

[Choir: Ozuna, Wisin]
Scave with me tonight, baby
I want to eat you (UOH-OH-OH), you will love it (you will love it)
You know that you always have a good time (you pass it well)
I want to eat you, your lips kiss (ladies and gentlemen, the wonder)

[Verse 3: Archangel, from the ghetto, wisin]
Au!
If you escape with me it will be another story (Ajá)
Unforgettable moments in your memory (Yeah)
Do not listen to comments or scum
Fly with me, come I invite you to savor the glory
You, with you, take out the lotus'
You are hot, in your gaze I notice it (Hot)
Your body is the ship
And in this special case, I have been the pilot (me ')
In the space of your being I want to lose (I ')
And learn all the secrets that your skin hides (I ')
I would like to see with you a new dawn
Not on Earth, but in the air at 30 thousand feet (First Class)
Dare, I'm going to you, leave shyness
And you will see how again you will want again (Muah)
Look out the window and tell me what do you see (what do you see?)
Only white clouds and a lifeless life
(Archangel, Pa ', Remix, Ah, De la Ghetto)
[Verse 4: from the ghetto]
Ok, how about the baby I look for you at A. Romeo (OH)
That I have half phillie already in the ashtray (OH-OH)
Relax, to caress you the 'seat' leather (eh)
I speak to you clearly, you know that I am sincere (uoh)
I see you sad and also a little lost (uoh)
It will be because of the problems you have spent in your life (huh)
Scave with me, extended vacation (OH)
To travel the world from Egypt to Argentina (UOH)
I don't want this to end (no)
I want you to stay a little more (no)
You are something I can't forget (Yeah)
And with you I escape again

[Chorus: Bad Bunny, Wisin, Noriel]
Scave with me tonight, baby
I want to eat you, your lips kiss
You know that with me you always have a good time
I want to eat you (a), your lips kiss (gentlemen, Noriel the dangerous, not-no-noriel)

[Verse 5: Noriel, Wisin]
I got tired of thinking about my bed (aha)
Today I'm going to look for you to kill the desire (wouh)
Your body and your soul calls me (ah)
They throw the bad because the one who does not win, always defames
You know what the goal is (Wouh)
I am the only one who understands to 'what your body interprets (aha)
We live playing in a roulette
But for you I leave it to 'and I start looking for you for the planet
I am crazy with your photo and as if that were not enough (Baby)
You know that I am the pilot
Neither you, nor do I have a broken heart (no)
I am not in love, but na 'more wants with me and not with another (Almighty)

[Verse 6: Almighty, Wisin]
You filled my heart
Because before it was useless as an iPhone 7 that does not have the chip
They want to sink the ship in which I saw 'together
And I am an expert at Battleship (hahaha)
I'm a player, you are my Championship
I want to give you kisses
I want to eat you to 'the days, we have a partner
That nobody gets more than damaging the relationship
Today I dressed in white, all white pa 'ti (pa' ti)
I bathed in the perfume you like, Clive Chris
Scave with me and remove the clothes that naked vamo 'to record a feat (mommy, the money bear)

[Choir: Ozuna, Wisin, Archangel]
Scave with me tonight, baby (uoh-oh)
I want to eat you (UOH-OH-OH), you will love it (you will love it)
You know that you always have a good time (you pass it well)
I want to eat you, your lips kiss (Yeah; Au!)

[Outro: Wisin, Almighty, Bad Bunny, Noriel]
Listen well, princess, just have a decision
You give approval and I execute
Double U, Ozuna, Almighty (It's The Game Changer)
Bad Bunny (Bad Bunny, Baby, Baby)
Archangel
The ghetto
No-no-Noriel, Noriel the dangerous
