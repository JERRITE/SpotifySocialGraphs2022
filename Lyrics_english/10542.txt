Cigarette Ahegao Lyrics[Intro]
As an Amewican, fuck!

[Verse 1]
So like, I guess they call it the "sophomore slump"
Always crying, always drunk
A few dead, more gone; the rest well on their way
(Thanks, I hate it)
So everyone that I love is stuck
Because this, that, the other, and the state fucked up
We covered it in a class that I'm about to fail
[Chorus]
Well, I feel better now (UwU)
Cigarette ahegao (Uh huh)
I haven’t had another episode, except last night was touch and go
No need to cry about it

[Post-Chorus]
UwU
Hey incels? Just have sex
Duh

[Verse 2]
Trash on the walls and trash on the floor
Liquid eyeliner stuck to the doors
Screwing everything up, and doing everything wrong
In my defense, I wasn't supposed to be around this long, so

[Chorus]
Well, I feel better now (UwU)
Cigarette ahegao (UwU)
No need to cry about it (UwU)
(Oh, I don't smoke, I just like how it smells)

[Bridge]
Get thin on smoke and coffee
Get fat on pie and biscuits
God bless this perfect shitstorm
I hope that it takes me with it
I have a soft small body
Strawberries make it happy
Someday, I’ll leave the country
I hope to have you with me
Get wrecked on becherovka
Get fucked on smoke and wine
Someday, I'll have my own life
I'll leave this all behind
You might also like[Outro]
Uh huh
