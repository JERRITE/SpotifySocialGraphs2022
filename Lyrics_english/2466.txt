Girls on the Dance Floor Lyrics[Intro]
Girls on the dance floor
The Stereotypes
Girls on the dance floor
Girls on the dance floor
Girls on the dance floor

[Verse 1]
I see you chilling by the bar
Why don't you grab your girls and come here with a star?
Yup, up in VIP, drinks on me
Swag on tight, with a gangsta lead
Everybody knows just who I are
[Chorus]
Girl, you know what it is? (Girl, you know what it is?)
Follow me to the floor (Follow me to the floor)
You can bring a couple of friends
(You can bring a couple of friends)
They can drink a little more (They can drink a little more)
They can drink a little more (They can drink a little more)
They can drink a little more (They can drink a little more)
They can drink a little more
Oh, you don't hear me though? (Oh, you don't hear me though?)
They can drink a little more

[Interlude]
You know about the stereotypes?

[Verse 2]
I take a shot of Patron
Two shots and it's on
Three shots, four shots, five shots
Oh shit, I think I'm gone
You see that girl walking by?
She gave me them bedroom eyes
Later on, I'mma take that home
And smack them bedroom thighs

All my girls, hit the dance floor floor
I'mma get you drunk and make you lose control (Control, control)
Gotta arch your back, swing your hair
Just like that, I don't care
After here, I'm about to take you home
[Pre-Chorus]
