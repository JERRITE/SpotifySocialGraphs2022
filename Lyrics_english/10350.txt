Won’t Make a Sound Lyrics[Intro]
(Broken)
(Break me)
(Broken)
(How does it feel?)

[Verse 1]
Nothing cuts quite like a memory (Like a memory)
Especially one that you're trying to forget (I'm trying to forget)
But I can't find the energy (The energy I need)
To rewind and reset (Rewind and reset)
I know you don't wanna be used, but you used me too
Build up, you build up to break me down
[Chorus]
How does it feel, how does it feel to knock me around?
I won't make a sound (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't make a sound (Sound, sound)
Until I hit the ground (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't make a sound (Sound, sound)
So don't shoot me down
Alright, we're not broken
We're just getting off the ground
Afraid of the truth

[Drop]
Broken
Break me
How does it feel?
Broken
Break me down
(Down)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I lack the bravery (The bravery)
'Cause I know I fear the end (I fear the end)
One day we'll see a victory (A victory we need)
Carry on until the sun will set
To break me down

How does it feel, how does it feel to knock me around?
I won't make a sound (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't make a sound (Sound, sound)
Until I hit the ground  (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't make a sound (Sound, sound)
So don't shoot me down
Alright, we're not broken
We're just getting off the ground
Alive but I'm choking
I hope you're better now

[Drop]
Broken
Break me
How does it feel?
Broken
Break
(Down)

[Outro]
