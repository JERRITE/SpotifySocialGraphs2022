Angel Eyes Lyrics[Intro: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaah
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

[Verse 1: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
Last night
I was taking a walk
Along the river
And I saw him together
With a young girl
And the look
That he gave her
Made her shiver
[Pre-Chorus: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
'Cause he always used
To look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha
It’s a game he likes to play

[Chorus: Amanda Seyfried]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and you’re hypnotized
He’ll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaah
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking ‘bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

[Verse 2: Amanda Seyfried]
Sometimes when I’m lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time
When I see him will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha
How can I forget that name?
You might also like[Chorus: Amanda Seyfried]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and you’re hypnotized
He’ll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep into those angel eyes

[Chorus 2: Amanda Seyfried]
Crazy ‘bout his angel eyes
Angel eyes
He took my heart, now I must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep
Into those angel eyes
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Outro: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking, a-aaah
I keep thinking
About his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking, a-aaah
I keep thinking
About his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha
A-aaah
I keep thinking about his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha
I keep thinking, a-aaah
I keep thinking about his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha, I keep thinking4Embed
