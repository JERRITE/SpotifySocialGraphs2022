Pretty Lyrics Girl [Lyrics for "Niña Niña"]

[Verse 1]
Pretty girl, princess smile
Which is a masterpiece from head to toe
Perfect laugh, so simple and so flirtatious
As much as she hides her beauty

[Chorus]
And I wonder, what would happen if I sing to you this song?
I tell you what I feel
What would you say if you choose a star?
High flight and I'm for her
If I take you to another universe
And then I ask you a kiss
And if we dance tonight and take you here in my heart
If I take care of you every day, tell me, baby what would you say?
If I am here, and I never leave, would you tell me no?
[Verse 2]
What would you say if we ride my car
And we travel until the sun goes out?
What would you say if in the morning I sing to you
And do I prepare something rich for both of them?
What would you say if every day is an adventure
Where do you laugh and enjoy this song?
As a gift would give you a thousand smiles where I can hear your sweet voice

[Chorus]
And the question is, what would happen if I sing to you this song?
I tell you that I love you
What would you say if you choose a star?
High flight and I'm for her
If I take you to another universe
And then I ask you a kiss
And if we dance tonight and take you here in my heart
If I take care of you every day, tell me, baby what would you say?
If I am here, and I never leave, would you tell me no?

[Bridge]
Would you tell me no?
Would you tell me no?
Would you tell me no?

[Chorus]
And the question is, what would happen if I sing to you this song?
I tell you that I love you and that I love you
What would you say if you choose a star?
High flight and I'm for her
If I take you to another universe
And then I ask you a kiss
And if we dance tonight and take you here in my heart
If I take care of you every day, tell me, baby what would you say?
If I am here, and I never leave, would you tell me not? You might also likembed
