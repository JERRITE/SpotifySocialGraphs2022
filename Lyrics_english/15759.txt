Eternally beautiful Lyrics [letter from "eternally beautiful"]

[Verse 1]
I would like you to tell me again and again
"I love you, baby, I love you and I will always love you."
With that foreign language that softe my legs

[Verse 2]
That you have a sugar mouth, I already know that
That you kiss with poison burns and honey
That you have changed me, there is no doubt, I know too and I like it
[Pre-Car 1]
That's why I'm going to be for you, for you, for you

[Chorus]
Eternally beautiful, beautiful (uh, uh, uh)
With a gypsy spell I will be the enchanted princess
That will love you desperately, desperately
Eternally beautiful, beautiful (uh, uh, uh)
And in the middle of the iguana, I make a gypsy spell
So that you always continue desperately in love with me

[Verse 3]
Shoot, you are already willing to die for me
Why do you sell so expensive? Tell me since yes
After those black lenses, what the hell do you think?

[Verse 4]
This is the Russian roulette, take value
What are doubts about? Do the same as me
If I find something that I like, I take it and I don't think about it

[Pre-Coro 2]
From today I promise to be for you, for you, for you

[Chorus]
Eternally beautiful, beautiful (uh, uh, uh)
With a gypsy spell I will be the enchanted princess
That will love you desperately, desperately
Eternally beautiful, beautiful (uh, uh, uh)
And in the middle of the iguana, I make a gypsy spell
So that you always continue desperately, desperately

Eternally beautiful, beautiful (uh, uh, uh)
With a gypsy spell I will be your delighted princess
That will love you desperately, desperately
Eternally beautiful, Bellaembed
