Israelâ€™s Son Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hate, is what I feel for you
And I want you to know that I want you dead
You're late for the execution
If you're not here soon, I'll kill your friend instead

[Chorus]
All the pain I feel
Couldn't start to heal
Although I would like it to
[Verse 2]
I hate you and your apathy
You can leave, you can leave, I don't want you here
I'm playing this pantomime
But I don't see you showing any signs of fear

[Chorus]
All the pain I feel
Couldn't start to heal
Although I would like it to
This time I'm for real
My pain can not heal
You will be dead when I'm through

[Verse 1]
Hate, is what I feel for you
And I want you to know that I want you dead
You're late for the execution
If you're not here soon, I'll kill your friend instead

[Chorus]
All the pain I feel
Couldn't start to heal
Although I would like it to
This time I'm for real
My pain can not heal
You will be dead when I'm through

Hate and execution
Put your hands in the air, Put your hands in the air, the air

[Outro]
I am, I am Israel's son
Israel's son I am
Put your hands in the air, Put your hands in the air
I am, I am Israel's son
Israel's son I am
Put your hands in the air, Put your hands in the air1Embed
