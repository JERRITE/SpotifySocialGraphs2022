Fortunately it is not you lyricsletra of "fortunately it is not you"

[English Translation]

[Verse 1]
You arrive, you flirt, you talk about more
You make great entry into each place
You don't make me sweat
You told me you had 26
You behave like about 10 or 6
How will I escape?
[Pre-car]
Look, for God's
What a horror, let's shut up!
That your librettos do not work with me
I don't know, who told you that
Your strategy works, not
Somebody save Me!

[Chorus]
Uuuh, I don't want a story man
Uuuh, I don't look for someone perfect
Uuuh, I want something natural, someone who knows how to love
That I get intoxique with love of the body
That I envy me with each kiss
I fell in love with the bones
Uuuh, fortunately it is not you

[Verse 2]
I don't know how many drinks you have more
That nothing is understood when talking
You don't make me sweat

[Pre-car]
Look, for God's
What a horror, let's shut up!
That your librettos do not work with me
I don't know, who told you that
Your strategy works, not
Somebody save Me!
