TFV2 Lyrics (Enter)

(The Word Tilde)

Do not rest until the goal, it is impossible for me to break
You are still turtle but this hare does not sleep
We start with what we put and work even with fever
So that we never lack until the day they bury me

(Chorus)
Now where are those who were going to be
I only see their face if I uncorcore champagne
When I win a medal or when I'm going to charge
They know that I am not a hypocrite I show me rеal

Tell me who are the ones who speak badly
Sometimes I do not know which is which is which
That whore sticks and I already know the end
The day that is really needed does not give a vital sign

(Verse 1)
To the town in which I live for me has been an obstacle
Even my own friends because some are plastic
To some other leather, but now they are phonatic
Cough those who said that this was just a pálpito

Look at my face, they thought I wasn't clear
Because dark was the way and nothing was seen
Now we are generating envy you get face
Because I have been humble God sends me money and fame

I don't have a sig-sauer but it's a matter of time
I have to be pending, I have to be attentive
I am an HP until the last breath
A funeral of a rival is better than a lament
You Might Also Like (Choir)

Now where are those who were going to be
I only see their face if I uncorcore champagne
When I win a medal or when I'm going to charge
They know that I am not a hypocritical I show me real

Tell me who are those who speak badly
Sometimes I do not know which is which is which
That whore sticks and I already know the end
The day that is really needed does not give a vital sign

(Verse 2)

They ask me to stay when I'm taking the knob
I don't want anyone to do my lao, I'm doing it alone
Dani lock me a hookah, who is uploading the monkey
Ten bottles on the table, this looks like a bowling track

Tell me there's better than going out for grx
And give infinite turns like a Scalextric car
I went down with Alvarito Boston Celtics dress
The babies without asking for it made Aupa Athletic

We are already billing, and I have only 17
The first 800 spent them on an iPhone 13
The following I spend on what I think I feel like
Or in two plates and a tana see how profit grows
(Chorus)

Now where are those who were going to be
I only see their face if I uncorcore champagne
When I win a medal or when I'm going to charge
They know that I am not a hypocritical I show me real

Tell me who are those who speak badly
Sometimes I do not know which is which is which
That whore sticks and I already know the end
The day that is really needed does not give a vital sign

(Outro)
You have to squeeze that letter
If it does not carry tilde, it is not well written
