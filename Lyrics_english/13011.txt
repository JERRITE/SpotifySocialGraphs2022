For the Ages LyricsDarling, you’re one for the ages
I’m glad you live here in mine
Your face and figure belong
To centuries been and gone
Those Renaissance and Roman times

Darling, you’re one for the ages
Long may you live in my rhyme
The years will cut us down
But they won't keep us in the ground
Out of the grave we’ll climb
Darling, you’re one for the ages
You’ll never go out of style
You walked into the ball
Dressed by Saint Vincent de Paul
With that shy and serious smile

Darling, you’re one for the ages
Your beauty suits every clime
There’s a mystery deep within
And in the light upon your skin
I could study for all time

Darling, you're one for the ages
Darling, you're one for the ages
Darling, you're one for the agesYou might also likeEmbed
