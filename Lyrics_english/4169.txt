Prrum Lyrics ["Prrrum" letter]]

[Intro]
Mommy, I've seen you
You get to the album next to him
I don't resist
You dance and the album wants to break
Mommy, I rob you, Ouh-Oh
And it doesn't happen na '
Your boyfriend is a fool, Ouh-Oh
He is not going to do na '
[Chorus]

If you catch it by the area, it says:
Prrum, Prrrum, Prrrum, Prrrum

The head of the tribe, since the IVU uploaded us
Your boyfriend is buying Reebok
I don't know Pique-Pique, it's Dracula Boy, Tickets
You are my Girly-Girl, Baby, so (Muah)
I love you in a bottle, ask me that I please you
They say I'm crazy about the helmet
Lo-Lo-Loco Crazy, I explode the cards in Macy's
I have the Thompson as Dick Tracy
Pa'l of yours

He is bordering the Converse, the Guaynabito, but I am still
Hard on the street without giving the Dumbbells
My name does weigh, I am the principal and you the princess
And the cat of you paw it straightening
We put it good and healthy, mommy, I catch you between Shannan's
And the party is going to end early
You know how I'm with you, so soft with me
Mommy, it gets grossly and I fumigo, oh

You know me, "El Princi"! Embed
