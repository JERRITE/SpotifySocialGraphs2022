Life after you Lyricste loves more than normal and thought
That our love was
Infinite as the universe
And today it is reduced to a verse

I don't know where, or how will I be
Now that you've gone
My heart went with you
I don't know ... I don't know me

I want to forget that one day
You made me happy
But it is useless to pretend
I can't, I can't, I can't
Living without you
Life after you
It is endless punishment
And do not survive
My body without your body
Before and after you
Nothing is the same for me
I force myself to live in a veil
And do not survive
My memory without your memory
So is life, life after you

I will say this is not killing me
But that's not true
I have become an eternal ghost
That lives in your memory
And so what one day was no longer
Damn my luck of
Only in dreams see you
Loving you ... to love you
And to lose you

I want to forget that one day
You made me happy
But it's useless funeral
I can't, I can't, I can't
Living without you !!!

It is endless punishment
And do not survive
My body without your body
Before and after you
Nothing is the same for me
I force myself to live in a veil
And not survive ...
My memory without your memory
So is life, life after trembed
