BLOODY FUTURE Lyrics[Intro]
All the days you've watched the fire
You stare at it so
It's like a dance, watch the flames
The light, the rageful

[Chorus]
We were living in the eighties
Everybody going crazy
We were living in the nineties
Dot com, do you wanna find me?
We were even in the O's
Jet set international
We were living in the future
The bloody futurе
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1]
We're blowing up
I saw it deep in the screen
Cruеl world, mammal or machine
Can't stop that fire burning
I see haze going up
Feel sweat rolling down
Keep listening in
And I know the sound

[Pre-Chorus]
It gets
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Bubbling up, come to the surface
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Crumbling earth under our purse strings

[Chorus]
We were living in the eighties
Everybody going crazy
We were living in the nineties
Dot com, do you wanna find me?
We were even in the O's
Jet set international
We were living in the future
The bloody future
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Still lost in a fever dream
This blue marble keeps turning
Cell static in my ear ring and ring
I turned it up, I drift from my sound
Her tides rolling in
And we can't hide on the internet
Forever

[Bridge]
Forever, forever
Daisies dancing in the breeze together
Forever, forever
Shells clinging to the shore together
Forever, forever
Make me wonder what we've done together
Forever, forever
Wonder what we'll all become together

[Chorus]
We were living in the eighties
Everybody going crazy
We were living in the nineties
Dot com, do you wanna find me?
We were even in the O's
Jet set international
We were living in the future
The bloody future
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, naEmbed
