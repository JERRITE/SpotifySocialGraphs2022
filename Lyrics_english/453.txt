[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Rude boy, might lick a shot pon 'em
Run up in the dealer, I might get the drop on 'em (Give me that)
Niggas gettin' killed once we get the drop on 'em (Grrt)
Catch him in the whip, you know he got the chop' on him (Uh)
I be jumpin' out the roof like that nigga Birdie
Catch me sittin' in the coupe with that big .30
I just got the car washed, but that shit is dirty
Motherfucker, we ain't scared, all my niggas sturdy (What's up?)
Lil' bitch, I got two hundred on my neck now (Facts)
And they can trip or we can trip and take a jet down
God body in wide bodies with big watches
Got young niggas, them dumb niggas got big choppas

[Chorus: BEAM]
Soon as we step out, dem check out
Find wah dem deh 'bout
Gunshot
Soon as we step out, dem check out
Find wah dem deh 'bout
Gunshot

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Everybody got a gun, motherfucker, you can shoot it
Cops pull a chase then you know we gonna loot it
Sure we undisputed, boy, we do it like champions
I'm talking heavyweight, we used to do it in the Hampton Inn (Facts)
I'm finna do it big, where Diddy at?
Throw some ice in the sky, bring Biggie back
I'm all Aces in the club like Pitty Pat
And, yeah, we pushing P, we make the bity brack (What's up, Blood?)
Copping all my jewels down in Mazza
I be rocking all my jewels in the Gaza
You know I'm good with all the killers and the shottas dem
So tell 'em be cool 'fore I throw somethin' hot at them
