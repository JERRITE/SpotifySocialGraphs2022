Small Cuts Lyrics[Verse 1]
It doesn't take much
To cover up small cuts
Hid' 'neath the bandages
Under her sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
She just wants attention
We all want attention
She just wants it more than
She'd have you believe
[Chorus]
Goodnight, sleep tight
Don't let anyone bite
She will leave you deaf and bewildered
Oh how she floats like a butterfly
Stings like a killer

[Verse 2]
All of the good kids
Will darken their eyelids
Cover in make-up
And uncomfortable dress

[Pre-Chorus]
They just want attention
We all want attention
A beautiful kiss and
A sin to confess

[Chorus]
Goodnight, sleep tight
Don't let anyone bite you
She will leave you deaf and bewildered
Oh how she floats like a butterfly
Stings like a killer
You might also like[Outro]
It doesn't take much
To cover up small cuts
Hid' 'neath the bandages
Under her sleeves
Oh...8Embed
