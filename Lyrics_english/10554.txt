Pushback 5 (Ayesha Erotica Remix) LyricsHigh, now
High
High, now
High

I've gone wrong so many times now
Grown from stone I revive now
Don't ask me why
Well too many times
Oh my
I gave love to a ground
That watered itself
I try 5 steps towards love
I pushback 5
Oh my
I try 5 steps towards love
I pushback 5
Don't ask me why

Look for me
Look for me
Look for me
I get high now
Don't ask me why
Look for me, high
Look for me
Look for me, low
Look for me
Look for me
In the sky now
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
I get high, now
In the sky, now
I get high, now
Don't ask me why
Look for me
Look for me
Look for me
I get high, now
Look for me, high
Look for me
Look for mе, low
Look for me
In the sky, now

High, I feed clouds
Below I deny tears
Yeah
And my fears shine through
Like they're opaque
Not today no sadness not today
No love no, not today
I run so far away
Yeah, it may fill me up
But it may weigh me down
Yeah i'll choose for myself
I'll fly, fly, fly
So up, so up, so up, away
I'll fly, fly, fly

I try 5 steps towards love
I pushback 5
Oh my
I try 5 steps towards love
I pushback 5
Don't ask me why
Look for me
Look for me
Look for me
I get high, now
Don't ask me why
Look for me, high
Look for me
Look for me, low
Look for me
Look for me
In the sky now
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
I get high, now
In the sky, now
I get high
Don't ask me why
Look for me
Look for me
Look for me
I get high now
Don't ask me why
Look for me, high
Look for me
Look for me, low
Look for me
Look for me in the sky
Don't ask me whyEmbed
