Itâ€™s Always Something LyricsI look around me and I see what I wanted and what I settled for
Yeah, I've got the heart of a Joan of Arc but the soul of a gigolo
I've been good at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
Anytime I stopped to smell the roses they drew blood from me
Do you know what I mean?
You never ever get away clean. But it's alright
Yeah, touchdown, turn around, flag on the play

It's always something, you know it is, it's always something
It's always something, everyday, it's always something
When I was a kid the teachers and the priests said
"Why do you let him run around like that?"
My father said, "If the boy wants to play guitar, I say we let him."
Through the hard years he was my rock
When I just could not win
So it goes y'know my father died
Just before my leaky ship came in

Do you know what I mean?
You never ever get away clean. Oh, but it's alright yeah
Down one, homerun, your dog steals the ball

I step up to the table in the middle of my life
And I take my cards and I check them twice
I've got a killer hand and I'm ready to stake my claim
The cops raid the game
