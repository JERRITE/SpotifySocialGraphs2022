TranslationsEspañolBeautiful Faces Lyrics[Verse 1]
And as the earth returned to calmly dress itself in white
We caught a glimpse of all the people going out tonight
Big guys and little guys, and bad guys in cuffs
I bet they can't get enough

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I wanna be on Broadway and in Cabaret
Tonight, I must go out and celebrate St. Patrick's Day
Tonight, I must demand a raise so I can grab, let's say
Some part replacements and strawberry laces, no spaces
[Chorus]
Beautiful faces smiling over us
Lift your hands up and lead us back home
Beautiful people won't remember you, honey
I bet you can't get enough
Beautiful faces smiling over us
Lift your hands up and lead us back home
Beautiful people won't remember you, honey
I bet you can't get enough

[Verse 3]
Tonight, I'm good staying inside
But I'll be dancing for sure
Going to the stores, pulling socks out of the drawers
Of the people who you don't love anymore

[Chorus]
The beautiful faces smiling over us
Lift your hands up and lead us back home
Beautiful people won't remember you, honey
I bet you can't get enough
Beautiful faces smiling over us
Lift your hands up and lead us back home
Beautiful people won't remember you, honey
I bet you can't get enough
You might also like[Interlude]

[Chorus]
All the beautiful faces smiling over us
Lift your hands up and lead us back home
Beautiful people won't remember you, honey
I bet you can't get enough
I bet you can't get enough12Embed
