F*ck Love Lyrics[Chorus]
Fuck love
Got too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart
I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up
Like the seasons
Tell my mom I’m sorry
I’m too weak to bear these feelings
(so now it’s)
Fuck love
Nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault
Hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after
Everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive
Like the way, I used to
[Verse]
Feel you
Underneath my skin
Like a tattoo
Can’t forget
All of the memories
That I have with you
Visit you inside my dreams
I’ll be back soon
Keep me out the prеsent
What the past do
And ain’t no drug could fix me
I’m too fuckеd up
But that’s what all the lies
And broken trust does
I can’t even think
Without you on my mind
Even tho I’m breathing
I don’t feel alive

Tell me how it feels
To have a heart so cold
Without you in my arms
I have no one to hold
Now I know that
Everything that glitters
Ain’t gold
Broken into pieces
I could never be whole

Fuck love
Got too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart
I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up
Like the seasons
Tell my mom I’m sorry
I’m too weak to bear these feelings
(so now it’s)
Fuck love
Nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault
Hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after
Everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive
Like the way, I used to

[Verse]
Feel a death rattle
Think I’m turning into a ghost
Thinking I could
End this pain
With just one note
What will they remember
If I don’t make it to morning
Should I tell you how I feel
If it won’t matter anymore
Looking in the mirror
Don’t know who I see
It isn’t me
I don’t want to feel
Wake me up
And tell it’s a dream
I could never be
Anything that you wanted from me
Thought I had your heart but
Everything ain’t always what it seems

Devil in disguise
Every promise made
You didn’t keep
Played me for a fool
Stab me in the back
To watch me bleed
Look me in my eyes
And tell me that you didn’t feel a thing
Gave my heart to you
Didn’t know it’d be the end of me

Didn’t know
Didn’t know
But I know now
Wish I woulda knew
You’d turn out love into a war
How’d you learn to be so cruel and
Tear the heart right off my sleeve
Girl I gave you all my love
How could you do this to me?

[Chorus]
Fuck love
Got too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart
I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up
Like the seasons
Tell my mom I’m sorry
I’m too weak to bear these feelings
( so now it’s )
Fuck love
Nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault
Hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after
Everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive
Like the way I used to6Embed
