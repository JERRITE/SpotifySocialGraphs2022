​love is just a word Lyrics[Verse 1: Jasmine Thompson]
Love, there's nothing more to say
Every words already been written
Every chord, already played
You, make everything make sense
Every melody hits different
Every line and sentiment
Sounds brand new
After you

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson]
Purple rain is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah is an old song by an old man in a suit
And I guess love, is just a word
Without you
[Verse 2: Calum Scott]
Trust, is something you can't fake
It's so delicate and fragile
And it's something you can't break
They call it luck, it's something you can't makе
It's a falling star you catch and then you hope to God it stays
And you caught me, and I caught you

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson with Calum Scott]
Purplе rain is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah is an old song by an old man in a suit
And I guess love, is just a word
Without you

[Bridge: Jasmine Thompson with Calum Scott]
I'm half the man I'm supposed to be
Only one more thing to say
I fall in love more every day
When I'm with you
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
You're everything I need
The better part of me

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson with Calum Scott]
Purple rain is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah is an old song by an old man in a suit
And I guess love, is just a word
Without you
You might also like[Outro: Jasmine Thompson with Calum Scott]
And I guess love, is just a word
Without you
You, there's nothing more to say
Every word's already been written
Every chord, already playedEmbed
