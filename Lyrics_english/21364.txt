Big City Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune, which never stand still

[Chorus]
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
[Verse 2]
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something, I can't find anymore

[Chorus][x2]
Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

[Verse 3]
There is no dream that you can't make true
If you're looking for love
But there's no girl who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight

[Chorus][x3]You might also like2Embed
