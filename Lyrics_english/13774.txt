Your Teeth In My Neck Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gone before sunrise
Never sleep on the game, we're all shaking the dice
Now, if you roll 'em hard enough, could change your life
I'm on a roll on my own, I came to fight, I came to fight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What do I do it for?
I've been working so hard just to give you more
Gotta get right
What do you do it for?
When the rest of the world is falling through the floor
You gotta get right
[Chorus]
'Cause you know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
It's your teeth in my neck, your teeth in my neck

[Verse 2]
Some people worship, diamonds and pearls, silver and gold
Just to hold it, they'd give anything in the world
Kill us all off, they'd take our worth they pay us dirt
Is it worth it? Is it worth it?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What do I do it for?
I've been working so hard just to give you more
Gotta get right
What do you do it for?
Rich man keeps getting richer, taking from the poor
You gotta get right

[Chorus]
'Cause you know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
It's your teeth in my neck, your teeth in my neck

Don't you wanna get to know you?
Baby, take it slower, slower
Wow, baby, take it slow

[Chorus]
'Cause you know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
You know better, you know, you know
It's your teeth in my neck, your teeth in my neck13Embed
