TranslationsРусскийTürkçeFrançaisHonestly Lyrics[Chorus]
Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

[Verse]
Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem, I might make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" she said, "Baby, make me scream!"
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for youYou might also like30Embed
