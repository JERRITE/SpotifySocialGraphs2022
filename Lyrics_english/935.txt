The dark night Lyrics [lyrics by "The dark night" ft. Anuel AA]

[Enter: Anuel AA, Jory Boy]
Real until death, anuel
Maybach Music
The J Baby

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
His eyes are green, like a one hundred bill
And his eyes are green as Cristina too
Anuel money and power in 2012
And she wears Armani, if he knows her
As for the break time
She breaks the tile, money on my mind
With the secret weapon, in the VIP a Zeta
The devil has a boyfriend, but he never respects him, he
[Chorus: Jory Boy]
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
Baby again, I serve the park yes
Anuel and NELY causing you to swell
Feka is not allowed, names no longer exist
And if it is not Armani, then of Gucci wears
To make threesomes with Cristina, fine whore
I don't dance like Justin Bieber, but it's my selena
Gets diabolical and machine
He told me that he likes the holes of the bed and that they do not scare him

[Bridge: Jory Boy, Anuel AA]
There is no woman like that
That you go and make your prey
Punishment while touching and comes
Sex in the dark, is what entertains her, ey
You might also like there is a woman like that
That you go and make your prey
In full moon the wolf does not suit you
Sex in the dark, is what entertains it

[Chorus: Jory Boy, Anuel AA]
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey

[Verse 2: Jory Boy]
None gives Break, connects twelve to six, ey
On the track in a Porsche
Sponsored by your baby's wallet
They tell me that she jumps the puddle, with a suitcase cargo
He likes the bad and appears fine
I know that she is far from Santa

[Verse 3: Anuel AA]
(I started the daughter and 'Lucifer)
And that people know
A devil wants me to hit the tooth
He has an innocent face, but he is a diabolical, pornographic
Disguised as an angel but it is a satanic, ey
[Bridge: Jory Boy, Anuel AA]
There is no woman like that
That you go and make your prey
Punishment while touching and comes
Sex in the dark, is what entertains her, ey

There is no woman like that
That you go and make your prey
In full moon the wolf does not suit you
Sex in the dark, is what entertains it

[Chorus: Jory Boy]
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey
The night is dark, she shines as a goddess
Go with your friends and fight for which one is harder
The Duppers do not forgive
He likes the flowers that are laughing and does not fall in love ey, hey
