You’re On Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

[Verse 1]
You have some nerve showing your face here
It had been so long, I thought you disappeared
Why'd you pretend that we’re still so close
When it’s all too clear who you need the most
[Chorus 2]
But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe, you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you’re on

[Chorus 1]
Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I heard your name
I was losing hope, that you felt the same
And it's been so long since I'd seen your face
That in my own mind, I had been replaced
So won't you just

[Chorus 2]
But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe, you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you’re on
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

[Chorus 2]
But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe, you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you’re on22Embed
