Sorry (feat. Sofía Reyes) Lyrics ["Sorry" letter "ft. Sofia Reyes]

[Verse 1: Beret & Sofía Reyes]
Mmm-mm-mm
You always said that you would never leave, but that it would be fine
Do not fight for what you want only has a name and it's called losing
If I hurt you, it was not unintentionally, but without wanting
Tell me only what do you prefer if you have the option to have or fear
Mmm-mm-mm

[Pre-car: Beret, Beret & Sofía Reyes]
You just think about how it ends
I just think about how I will end
One day you tell me "I lack the desire"
Another think about it and I never beat you
I did everything because you stay (uuh, uuh)
Now I think about it and what I stayed (uuh, uuh)
Lost time, maybe I won it (UUH, UUH)
To miss telling you that
[Choir: Beret & Sofía Reyes, Beret]
Sorry, for wasting your time
For thinking about doing another attempt
To have you, fight and feel you would make you happy
I revive, because sometimes I don't even understand
How will I understand ours
If I never understood you

[Verse 2: Sofía Reyes, Beret & Sofía Reyes]
I know that in importing the past
That before me it is just growing
That we have never been two
Since telling fear we were three
Because we are so the same that if I leave you too
The failure is to have a problem and never learn
If I'm going to stay with you
If I'm going to run for the edge
I know the future was not ahead
Now I realize that I punish me
I already won at the time and is not lost
I never remember, but I don't forget
There are more letters that ever occurred
Because there is no force 'for those who have written it

[Choir: Beret & Sofía Reyes, Beret]
Sorry, for wasting your time
For thinking about doing another attempt
To have you, fight and feel you would make you happy
Oh, I revive, because sometimes I don't even understand myself
How will I understand ours
If I never understood you

Because your successes will say where you are
And your failures just where to go
What is the amount of
If only the intensity will become happy
Before doing what is going to destroy us
I prefer to save myself and make me
Now I understand that you can't give me what you don't have or live in you

[Choir: Beret & Sofía Reyes]
Sorry, for wasting your time
For thinking about doing another attempt
To have you, fight and feel you would make you happy
I revive, because sometimes I don't even understand myself
How will I understand ours
If I never understood you

[Outro: Beret & Sofía Reyes, both]
You always said that you would never leave, but that it would be fine
Do not fight for what you want only has a name and it's called losing
If I hurt you, it was not unintentionally, but without wanting
Tell me only what do you prefer, if you have the option to have or fear
