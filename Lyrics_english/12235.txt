Hymn for the Missing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tried to walk together
But the night was growing dark
Thought you were beside me
But I reached and you were gone
Sometimes I hear you calling
From some lost and distant shore
I hear you crying softly
For the way it was before

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone?
Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?
Why did you go?
I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait, will you wait?
Will I see you again?
[Verse 2]
You took it with you when you left
These scars are just a trace
Now it wanders lost and wounded
This heart that I misplaced

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone?
Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?
Why did you go?
I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait, will you wait?
Will I see you again?You might also like3Embed
