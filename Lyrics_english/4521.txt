Distance Lyrics[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah (Uh, uh)
Yeah (Uh)
(And you know I got it)
My mind

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Nigga life end if he startin' with me
My niggas still goin’ hard in these streets
Triple six, nigga, the mark of the beast
I unlocked my potential, I'm feelin' unleashed, sheesh (’Leashed)
I put that bitch on a leash, leash (Leash)
Hit them all 'til they deceased, 'ceased (Deceased)
Lord have mercy on all my enemies (Enemies)
Know I may get it all by any means (By any means)
No, I won't fold, I ain't coppin' no pleas (Pleas)
Pull my dick out and she drop on her knees (Knees)
Power P, he goin' dumb on the beat (Beat)
I do not know who they want me to be
[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Unlocked my chains and I'm feelin’ so free
I tried to tell ’em, I been a OG (Yeah, yeah)
Tell me what they really know about me
I don't think they really know anything
Now you done fucked up, you woke up the beast
Everywhere I go, we 47 deep
We gon’ run down and they forced to retreat (Yeah)
Every last one of my niggas gon' eat

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
She tryna fuck, make her lock her knees
Can't hear you talk, I speak Guap-anese
Wrappin' the work, I’ma cop a ki'
Smoke out the V, tryna dodge police
Nigga been stuck in his ways
Bill Belichick, how I'm callin' out plays
Causin' a wreck, hope I don't catch a case
Watch how you step or my niggas will spray
G-Mackin', keep the heater packin' (Uh-huh)
See static, keep the reach slummin' (Uh-huh)
Squeeze 'matic, see your team nappin' (Uh-huh)
Wreak havoc, none my niggas cappin', that's a fact
Nigga been lit, I've been knockin' out hoes
Rollin' a zip, I'ma blow me a zone
Twistin' ya lips, now you got to go
Don't fuck with nigga, just leave me alone
You might also like[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Unlocked my chains and I'm feelin' so free
I tried to tell 'em, I been a OG (Yeah, yeah)
Tell me what they really know about me
I don't think they really know anything
Now you done fucked up, you woke up the beast
Everywhere I go, we 47 deep
We gon' run down and they forced to retreat (Yeah)
Every last one of my niggas gon' eat

[Verse 3: Erick The Architect]
I'ma need more than a 20 at least
Grew from the slum, now we reppin' the Beast (Woo)
She got the cake, so I'm takin' a piece
Make no mistake, I get play when I preach
Walk like a G, I put teams in the gang
Blessin' the karma that build up my name
Dead on arrival, endurin' the painless
All white huaraches in Europe, they trainers
Too many rappers and not enough painters
Frida or Dali, my palette like Monet
No one can stop me, I'm too stubborn too
Only get down when I'm stuck in the groove
Wipe myself down and I'm bustin' a move
Goldie, it's evident, ice out the tooth
In the meantime, I got nothin' to prove
Ride in the hoopty with nothin' to lose (Errt, errt)
[Outro: Erick The Architect]
Lose (Errt, errt)
Lose (Errt, errt)
Lose (Errt, errt)5Embed
