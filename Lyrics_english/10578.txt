Bottled Up (Spanish version) Lyrics [verse 1: Dinah Jane]
It doesn't matter if you give me the blue sky
I don't need more, just you
They say everything is better in life
When you find a love that is really

[Pre-Caro: Dinah Jane]
I'm a bad one, I want a bad dad
That makes me hard, daddy
I'm going to sleep, do pamper pa ’ti
You stay with me, I stay with you
Where are you going, you know that I follow you
I'm going to sleep, do pamper pa ’ti (woo)
[Chorus: Dinah Jane]
Taking, pass me the bottle
Smoking, baby, let's fly
Taking, pass me the bottle
Smoking, baby, let's fly

[Verse 2: Ty dolla $ ign]
Bottled Up, Yeah, Yeah
Bottled Up, Yeah
Feeling Like B & Jay, We're Drunk in Love, Yeah
I PUT 50 ON YOUR WRIST, THAT DON'T MEAN shit
WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU'RE MINE, I KNOW YOU MEAN
D'essé, put it on the rocks
Little Baby, On that French Vanilla Ciroc (Ooh, Yeah)
We could be anywhere in the world right now
But you're here with me, girl (oh, woah)

[Chorus: Dinah Jane]
Taking, pass me the bottle
Smoking, baby, let's fly
Taking, pass me the bottle
Smoking, baby, let's fly

[Verse 3: Dinah Jane]
You have sensuality that I liked
Don't change your rhythm, stay here
When let's start
I threw it to you
I know what you want is a touchdown
Yeah, Yeah
[Pre-Caro: Dinah Jane]
I'm a bad one, I want a bad dad
That gives me hard, daddy (ooh)
I'm going to sleep, do pamper pa ’ti
You stay with me, I stay with you (hey)
Where are you going, you know that I follow you
I'm going to sleep, do pamper pa ’ti

[Chorus: Dinah Jane]
Taking, pass me the bottle (AAH)
Smoking, baby, let's fly (HMM)
Taking, pass me the bottle (Whoa)
Smoking, baby, let's fly (baby)

[Outro: Dinah Jane]
Pass the bottle
Pass the bottle
Pass the bottle
