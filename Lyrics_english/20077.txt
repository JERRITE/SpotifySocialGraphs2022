Left 4 Dead Lyrics[Intro]
Gotta watch where I go, I don't hang like I, uh, ayy, ayy
(I'm working on dying)
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead
I just want my racks, ayy, look
(Ayy, Brandon, man, why you—)
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
Asked them, boy, that's facts, I did, ooh, ayy
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
I just want my racks, yeah, yo, uh, ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
Asked them, boy, that's facts, he did everything he said, ayy
I already know that's cap, but I just wanna know what's on your head, ayy
Say she love me back, but I'm just thinkin' 'bout what you said

[Verse]
Ayy, better leave it at that 'cause my big bro really want them dead
Don't talk about him in my raps 'cause I don't really want nothin' from the feds, uh
Shawty did me foul, it feels like she paid the ref
Gotta find her friend a towel, I don't want her fuckin' up the bed
Gotta watch where I go, I don't be hangin' like I used to
SRT, it go a lil' faster than what she used to
At my show, she shy, she just whisper like she Goonew
I don't want you around 'cause I can't control what these fools do
He don't come around 'cause that lil' boy know what he did, ayy
All on them computers, got these bitches in our business, uh
When I got some money, I just switched up like I did, ayy
She been out of town really wonderin' how I live, uh
I wish I was home, I don't like tourin' like I used to
I don't pick up the phone, so she just get her time through YouTube
Hate me through them phones, but he don't really get wild like he used to
Put my heart in chrome, they'll kill you after they use you

[Chorus]
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
Asked them, boy, that's facts, he did everything he said, ayy
I already know that's cap, but I don't really wanna know, ooh, ayy, ayy
I already know that's cap, but I just wanna know what's on your head, ayy
Say she love me back, but I'm just thinkin' 'bout what you said
You might also like[Outro]
Is you comin' back? Ayy
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
I just want my racks, my lil' baby left me for dead, ayy
