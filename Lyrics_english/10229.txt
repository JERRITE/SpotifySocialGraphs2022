Tear Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so over being over you
I'm so done doing things I'm supposed to do, mm
I got a problem with letting go
Yeah, I just thought I should let you know
(thought I should let you know)
That I still keep the light on
To show you that I'm home, wishing
Wishing you would come around more
Even though I know
Same moment you walk in, you're out the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh you give me love
Just to break my heart
Put me back together
Just to pull me a part
You give me a hand and kick me to the ground
Oh you build me up
Just to tear me down
Oh just to tear me down
Oh just to tear me down

[Chorus]
Down, down
You build me up (mm)
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up (Oh yeah)
Oh just to tear me down

[Verse 2]
Now I'm sober from your love
Just a touch will get me drunk, mm
My best friends are my memories
They're the only ones that save me from this misery
That's why I still keep the light on
To show you that I'm home wishing
Wishing you would come around more
Even though I know
Same moment you walk in, you're out the door
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh you give me love
Just to break my heart
Put me back together
Just to pull me apart
You give me a hand then kick me to the ground
Oh you build me up
Just to tear me down, oh
Oh just to tear me down, oh yeah
Oh just to tear me down

[Chorus]
Down, down
You build me up (mm)
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up (Oh yeah)
Oh just to tear me down

[Bridge]
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up
Oh just to tear me down
Down, down
You build me up (mm, oh yeah)
Oh just to tear me down
(Oh)
Down, down
You build me up
(Yeah yeah)
Oh just to tear me down
Down
[Outro]
Oh you give me love
Just to break my heart
Put me back together
Just to pull me apart
You give me a hand then kick me to the ground
Oh you build me up
Just to tear me down, oh
Oh just to tear me down, oh yeah
Oh just to tear me down, down, down, ohEmbed
