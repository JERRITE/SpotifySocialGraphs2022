Play It On My Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a song that I'm looking for
Oooh oh oh
Nobody plays it nowadays
Oooh oh oh
But it made me so happy
Oooh oh oh
Now that's all that I'm looking for
Oooh oh oh

[Verse 2]
There's a song that I'm looking for
Nobody plays it anymore
They don't know what they're missing
They never heard the song, no
Oh no
[Chorus]
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio

[Verse 3]
It was such long, long time ago
Oooh oh oh
Like in another life
Oooh oh oh
It all looked so different then
Oooh oh oh
They caught me when smiling
Oooh oh oh

[Chorus]
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio

It was always summer
It was always summer in my mind
It was always summer
It was always summer in my mind
It was always summer

[Outro]
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radio
Play it on my radioEmbed
