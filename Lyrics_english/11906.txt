Never A Good Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Spencer Stewart]
Old enough to know, "If you love her, let her go"
In another high and low, you gotta do whatever feels right
Young enough to break, just a little give, I take
I don't wanna walk away but I gotta do whatever feels right

[Pre-Chorus: Jeffery Jordan]
Continental in my hotel lobby
You know I never meant to do you like that
I'll miss your laugh and, girl, I'll miss your body
But once it's broken, then it won't go back
[Chorus: Jeffery Jordan, Spencer Stewart]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Maybe your star sign will tell you why
And she said, "No, no, a million times no
You know I'd rather die than see you lettin' me go," but
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah

[Verse 2: Spencer Stewart]
Hard enough to say, "If you love her, you can't stay"
But I got places to be, I'm due for chasin' down the skyline
Easier to wait, play it out and let it fade
But I wasn't built for that, yeah, stayin' isn't in my bloodline

[Pre-Chorus: Jeffery Jordan]
Sentimental in my hotel lobby
You know I never meant to leave you like that
I'll miss your laugh and, girl, I'll miss your body
But here's the moment where we fade to black

[Chorus: Jeffery Jordan, Spencer Stewart]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Maybe your star sign will tell you why
And she said, "No, no, a million times no
You know I'd rather die than see you lettin' me go," but
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah

(Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah)

[Chorus: Jeffery Jordan, Spencer Stewart]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Maybe your star sign will tell you why
And she said, "No, no, a million times no
You know I'd rather die than see you lettin' me go," but
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Stewart]
(Never a good time to say goodbye, yeah)
(Never a good time to say goodbye)Embed
