Bottoms Up Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Are you ready
Alexandra
Mohombi

[Verse 1: Mohombi]
It's gettin' hot, bring out them shots
We gonna be dancin forever
Shoot for the sky, we gettin' high
First time we feel it together
Lookin' so fine, now that you're mine
Baila conmigo morena
Sex on the beach, sippin' all night, night long
[Chorus: Alexandra Joner & Mohombi]
Bottoms up, up, up, we got no time to worry
Tonight we live the rush (bottoms up, up, up)
We doin' what we wanna
No no we can't get enough
You know you got me hot, drunk in love
We like ba rum rum, ba rum rum
Bottoms up

[Verse 2:Alexandra Joner]
Lost in the lights, feeling so high
We can make noise forever
Can't get enough, we set it off
Make this a night to remember
I know what you want, know what you need
Yeah we ain't promised tomorrow
Just you and I, feeling so right
Ba rum ba rum

[Chorus: Alexandra Joner & Mohombi]
Bottoms up, up, up, we got no time to worry
Tonight we live the rush (bottoms up, up, up)
We doin' what we wanna
No no we can't get enough
You know you got me hot, drunk in love
We like ba rum rum, ba rum rum
Bottoms up
