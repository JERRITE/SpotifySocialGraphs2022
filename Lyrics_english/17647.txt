Could Be There Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh I need to go outside 'cause I know
I've been having way too many sober nights on my own
How much longer can I take
'Fore my mind will start to break?
I just need to get away
It's not the same

[Chorus]
Oh I think about that days
When the sun was shining down
Upon my face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now
Oh I think about that days
When the sun was shining down
Upon my face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now
Oh I think think about that days
When the sun was shining down down down
My face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now

[Verse 2]
Tell mе can you memorize the thrill?
Of how wе used to dance away the night on two pills
How much time we gotta waste
'Fore we finally have a change?
We just need to get away
All I wanna say is

[Chorus]
Oh I think about that days
When the sun was shining down
Upon my face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now
Oh I think about that days
When the sun was shining down
Upon my face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now
Oh I think think about that days
When the sun was shining down down down
My face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now

[Chorus]
Oh I think about that days
When the sun was shining down
Upon my face
Having all my friends around
I wish that I could be there
I could be there now

Having all my friends around
