The Lyrics chair [letter of "the chair"]

[Intro]
Trooko

[Verse 1]
Son, here is my criticism
With the first one I gave you so hard that in your second attempt I started talking about politics
After this, they get into the asylum and they are not jokes
For being throwing something that no longer exists
I am what you still did not understand
Without magical wand or abracadabras, only with words you disappeared
Not that I am smart, is that you are an idiot
That is why those who follow you write "people" with jota
A reggaetonero who does not know where the horizon is
And that he thinks that in Everest there are rhinos
You are so animal
That you still did not find out that six for eight are the times in a musical compass
That you don't know what the left is or the right
And that he thinks that in Latin America there are only Indians with arrows
You are tiny as a gland
Throwing to you is lower than throwing a vedette in a show program
I'm still wasting my time talking about the clear
Throwing a reggaetonero who has two buttocks on his face
The only achievement of your life that was fruitful
It was three million 'of memes mocking you in less than a minute
A man full of illusions
It gives me tenderness as in your social networks you put your e-mail for hiring
Eleven years in prison creating expectation everywhere
And the empty coliseum with the gift tickets
I am doing stadiums internationally
June 17 in Mexico, National Auditorium
And you are doing discos that give sadness
Where women enter free and give you beer
You have four fans, I have thousands
Ask Baby Rasta who saw me play in Chile
And we provide with Zacapa after the concert
And although I have done the choir, if you want to take rum, I invite you (switch)
I make you a molecule when I stand as augula
With my rhymes esdrújulas, you miss with compass
Consonantly and chronicly
Pa 'that the phoneme' after tonic vowels coincide
You are better than me is just a Platonic idea
I make you cry without singing blues and without touching the harmonica
I translate your brain with short understanding
Something simple: I am fast and you are slow (switch it)
This is not even a fight
I am like your grandmother, Fu-Pshh, sticking with the belt
In this genre, I am Fucking Rock-N-Roll
Glossless shine, without armor all, without being patent
I am the light of lantern, Flame of fire and alcohol
I am your headache without paracetamol
I am the one who relive you again, the one who teaches you to write
I'm your mother and your dad without having to give birth
I am the one who will make you go to religion
I am what happened to you over truck -shaped
The hurricane who could not predict the meteorologist
I am everything that will bill the psychologist
What you don't see coming, I'm the Knockout that I gave you
I am all in Puerto Rico mocking you
And the one who puts them right in line in a row
I'm Muhammad Ali Partying your face in Manila
[Chorus]
I took you out of the grave, I took you out of the pantheon
Look for the shovel, earth and rum
Bring the colored flowers
That today I will bury you without a priest and without pastore '
I took you out of the grave, I took you out of the pantheon
Look for the shovel, earth and rum
Bring the colored flowers
That today I will bury you without a priest and without pastore '

[Bridge]
(Look for the shovel, earth and rum)
(Look for the shovel, earth and rum)
(Look for the shovel, earth and rum)
(Look for the shovel, earth and rum)

[Verse 2]
Never seen in a battle
The first rapper that cries because I didn't even go out of line
As a child I was diagnosed with autism
And while I pierce, I write rhymes that leave it in any type of rhythm
And he threw me to a blind, blind person
That raps more than you, with many smarter rhymes
And if I was wrong with stereotypes
Now I am with the Special Olympics Committee working as a team
But what are you doing, partner?
If you are so millionaire I invite you to donate your money
But you don't have to pay a nissan
First pay for the hundred thousand dollars you owe to Ángel Pagán
If I were on your ship, shipwreck
They tell me that in the bar 'you can't pay your own drinks
And there is nothing wrong with not having money
But you say that you sell fillet and what it brings' is can meat
The fantasy of showing off the millions that you lack
It is the reason why the kids with guns assault you
You promote lies, I pure reality
In an unequal world where there are children eating garbage
But of a guy like you can expect?
Dressing a shirt from the Chapo and another by Pablo Escobar
I am not a communist, socialist or capitalist
I think in inventing something new, I better say that I am idealist (Change it)
I believe in equal infinite opportunities
I think education, health and food should be free '
I think he works more than the other deserves to win more
But I also believe in sharing what I have with others
But you don't share, all you share, my treasure
It is the game that gave you and those who did the choir
I believe in Rafael Hernández, who put those who believe the status to sing
Beautiful calls you the children of freedom
Every day you learn
Even Marc Anthony sings her and even he understands her
I have thrown photos with important people
Even if they don't think like me, they are still interesting
My brother, you have to learn to differentiate
It is one thing to know and another thing is to support
I believe in rapid, with a critical eye
I believe in the town above any politician
But you believe in the pyramids so that the rich are comfortable
All the poor have to be uncomfortable
And you didn't realize what they stole us
For the capitalism that you defend with the gold chains that they lent you
Without knowing, you support the dictatorships that people disappeared
Just for thinking differently
You can use our sister island
And to the murderer Rafael Trujillo in Dominican
You can use Pinochet and Videla example
Go to Buenos Aires and speak in Plaza de Mayo with the grandmothers
I believe in Serrat, Silvio Rodríguez, Violeta Parra
Rubén Blades, León Gieco, Víctor Jara and his guitar
And as Alí First says from the open sky:
"Those who die for life cannot be called dead"
The class' and history is over, I go to my final verses
We start with the kindergarten with the vowels
The resi rhyme, today your dad will eat you
And the slit will leave it more open than the Panama Canal
Your lyrics will end up hidden under Mom Sofa
The reggaetonos like you put them to sing Cancioncitas de Maná
They are not really, but I did not finish, the resident now rhymes with the e
You and your trunnating committee 'Chimpanzees babies, at the same time they make me coffee
I Pure
Because I am rapening, I am like Maradona with Pelé
And here I came back, I never left, I kept rhyming with the i
I left you, it's still as a mannequin, your vowels already ate them
I am an MC, surgeon of the verse that operates without scalpel
Your piece of wild boar body I distributed while taking a daiquiri
No, no, no, no, it did not end, the resi continues with the or
He took you, nailed you, fucked you, she clawed you, in effect dominoes
The resi Knocke, killed him, resurrected him and again buried him
I have them in their minds saying: "Be the mother who bore him!"
I know who I am; I am the one who took you from the Iglú, but tell me who you are
You are the frontoo that went to war and never returned, like mambrú
In the list of the improvement, you are not part of the menu
The resident gave you classes ending with the U
With this one I throw you, I send you to the retirement
I take off the breath of a single sigh
I crush you and throw you, I don't viro or turn
Your rhyme 'are blood and I am a vampire
I am a poet from another planet and my style has no labels
My full lyrics have a concrete goal: educate illiterate
Here I bring the alphabet in the form of a submachine gun
Beheading words like the zetas, I give them as tambourine
I eat them as if they were chops
With the belly full to the tits because my notebook will never be diet
When the resident squeezes, all the bags packed
And they end up pedaling even if they don't have a bicycle
You played the roulette and you ended up in the gutter
And for being abusing you, animal, now you are looking for Peta
I am a murderous whirlwind on the way, do not see me fortune tellers
And they fulminate them when I rhyme, I simmer them cook them
With cucumber, cumin, bacon and blood of its intestines
And I never end because my verses reproduce like the Chinese
With the wild octane courage that I brought in my language
I take them on my trip without passage and without paying toll
Without landing in my carriage they fly looking at the landscape
When without skates he skates the message on this skating track!
In the midst of a violent storm the rap atmosphere is heated
With a thousand five hundred ninety words and I go to a thousand seven hundred
I already lost the account and my belly is still hungry
In rap in Spanish the resident represents
I am spicy without pepper, refreshing like mint
I have the royal academy as a maid
More tools than a mechanic, this Hispanic rapper
Leave British MC like Harry Shotta in a state of panic
No boot, without door and without a hood
Take note, my rhyme is never exhausted because it floats
By the sea of your broken neurons, like a seagull
The one that exploits your carota of a blow that springs in your defeat
To the idiots like you I have them as a pet
I put them to pay the fee, the bankruptcy dictionary
And they don't hurt me because everything that throws me bounces, like a ball
I am the singer, lover of the consonant rhyme
The commander arrived, feel my students
Like Willie Mays, giant; brilliant as diamond
I feed them even if the restaurant is closed
Fighting without gloves against my own career
The MC do not see me come even if they eat carrot
I am the notorious oratory teacher
And I put glory and victory, to have sex to make history
This rola is cool alone and also flies consoles
If you want more, in the stove I have another pan
When they see me surfing above the waves
They end crazy trying to bite their own tail
With my entry in square head, closed, little prepared
And every rhyme launched is an exploited grenade
I had alphabet and all its kidnapped lyrics
Working for me as employees
After being slapped with kicks, frying, like empanada
Now I go with withdrawal and you are still nothing
Here ended the novel against the Merengue dancer
That wears shoes with frost and clothes with sequins
I have to stop, if I'm not going to lose control
From eating so much scrap rat
You Might Also Like [Outro]
Already, now, now, I'm going to stop
One thousand nine hundred words, this is a new record, my people
Hears
The only ones that can throw me and nail my brother Gabriel
And my wife, who writes a pair of rhyme ', nail me, but nobody else
And I want to apologize to the people of my label
This ... Anir, forgive me for having made this song
I know they told me not to throw anything
A Afo, forgiveness, really
Pepo, bad mine
I know that it is' with the tour, with a lot of things
Bad mine, but this is fun
I think I'm going to open a rehabilitation university for reggaetoneros who don't know how to write
Hey, and bad mine, Elijah, that I know you told me not to lower me, but it is very easy
Forgive me, pole, too; sorry
Bastards, with me cannot at heart, take off
Second round or second round
Bastard, I nailed you from the beginning
What happens is that I had a day off and I put this, calm
Trujillo Alto in the house
Carraízo in the house
The pearl in the house
The Morales neighborhood in the house
The pan at home
Puerto Rico in the house
I see them in December, bastards
Hears
