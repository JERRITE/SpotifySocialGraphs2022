Girl Next Door Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the pinups in magazines
Movie stars on the silver screen
Don't do anything for me
Can't you see?
What you get is what you see
No more, "Maybe it's Maybelline"
She can give you everything you need
What you need

[Chorus]
She's the girl next door
Nice but naughty
A heart that's pure
She's the girl next door
She's for me
[Verse 2]
You can take her home to Mom
'Cause she's got that small-town charm
That glows anytime you want and more
And you know she's your biggest fan
'Cause she'll cancel all her plans
Give you everything she can 'til the end
'Til the end

[Chorus]
She's the girl next door
Nice but naughty
A heart that's pure
She's the girl next door
She's for me

[Chorus]
She's the girl next door
Nice but naughty
A heart that's pure
She's the girl next door
She's for me

[Bridge]
Think I'll take a walk
Or down the road she's on
Maybe not
I think I'll call her on the phone
Or am I better off alone?
You might also like[Chorus]
She's the girl next door
Nice but naughty
A heart that's pure
She's the girl next door
She's for me

[Chorus]
She's the girl next door
Nice but naughty
A heart that's pure
She's the girl next door
She's for me

[Outro]
She's for me (girl next door)
She's for me (girl next door)
She's for me (girl next door)2Embed
