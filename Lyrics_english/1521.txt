Summer on You Lyrics[Intro: Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

[Verse 1: Zion, Edwin]
Darling, I've been working all week (yeah)
I've got so much on my plate, always saying "poor me"
Although my boss is an a-hole, that's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan to hit the road with me  (yeah)
I'll pick you up after and-
[Pre-Chorus: Edwin]
We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke when love is all we own, I'm singin'

[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Austin, Zion]
I'm singin', "hey babe"
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face (ha-ha-ha-ha)
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel a love like this
Stronger than anyone else
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Edwin, Zion & All]
We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage (aye!)
So let me spend this pocket change
We'll drink beer like it's champagne (champagne)
Stay out kissin' in the rain
We don't care if we are broke when love is all we own, I'm singin'

[Chorus: All & Zion]
Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they (yeah) pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (uh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Nick, Brandon, Both]
Oh, I know baby we ain't got no money
All we got is love, but
I know that can see us through
It might sound crazy
But why do we need sunshine?
When we can stay and sip warm beer
While holed up in a room
That's how we spend my summer like (on you, babe)
[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is (hey) time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (uh)
Oh I will spend my summer on you
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh I will spend my summer on you22Embed
