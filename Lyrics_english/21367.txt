Where Are You Now? Lyrics[Intro: Lady Leshurr]
Ayy, ayy
There's so many people that have left the scene
Mad ting, man
And I can't see them anymore
Where are ya?
Where are you now?

[Verse 1: Lady Leshurr]
Where? Can't see you anywhere (Nah)
Rude girl, stay over there (Stay)
Or I'll put you back like hair (Scrape 'em back)
Yeah, you are not quite there (Nah)
Oh well, it's unfair; you'll get air
When I'm in the building, you come out
When I'm onstage, it gets shut down
When I walk in, you best look down
Fire alie, gets bun down
Everyone knows I'm the talk of the town (Yeah)
Everyone know when I'm walking in town (Yeah)
Oh my gosh, is that Lesha? (Wha?)
Make them fall to the ground, wow
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
Where are you now? (Where?) 'Cause I can't see ya (I can't see ya)
Where are you now? (Where?) I wouldn't wanna be ya (I wouldn't wanna be ya)
Where are you now? (Where?) 'Cause I can't see ya (I can't see ya)
Where are you now? (Where?) I wouldn't wanna be ya

[Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now?
(Where?) I said, where are you now? Where are you now?

[Verse 2: Lady Leshurr]
Where are ya, kid? (Where?)
I'm like wait, where are you, kid? (Ha)
You fell off, now your arm is ripped (Nah)
Attention, army ting (Woo)
Look, you was on top (Yeah)
Then you just flopped (You flopped)
You thought you was gonna blow up (Blow up)
You was gassed, got popped (Got popped)
Look, you're so late, with it (So late)
I said, you're so late widit (So late)
I'm on top and you're hating it (Yeah?)
And you look like 86 years old (Ha, ha, ha)
I get paid to spit
Heard your stuff, ain't rating it (Wait, hmm)
Your boyfriend was staring me down (Yeah)
Now he's on my phone like "where are you now?" (Woo)

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Where are you now? 'Cause
Any time I speak, that's news
See man on the 6 o'clock news
I've got choices, so I can choose
I've got a shop and we sell sports shoes
And I'm in control when man cruise
My DJ on the 1s and 2s
Aim for the 6, but still got views
Any time I speak, that's news
Any time I speak, that's doodoodoodadada
Any time I speak, that's tiger, tiger
Done with the shoulda, coulda, doodoodoodoodadada
Wiley, I'm getting them hyper, hyper
Doing this ting since MC Creepin'
Doing this ting ever since Pied Piper
And I know mandem in jail doing 5, doing 10s
Doing 15s and I know lifers
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
Where are you now? (Where?) 'Cause I can't see ya (I can't see ya)
Where are you now? I wouldn't wanna be ya (I wouldn't wanna be ya)
Where are you now? 'Cause I can't see ya (I can't see ya) (Mad ting!)
Where are you now? I wouldn't wanna be ya

[Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? (Where are you?) Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? (Where?) Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? (Where?) Where are you now (Where? Where are you?)
(Where?) Where are you now? (Where?) Where are you now? (I can't see ya)
(Where?) Where are you now? (Where?) Where are you now?
(Where?) Where are you now? Where are you now? (Where?)

[Outro: Lady Leshurr]

Where are ya, man?
You was on top of your game, son
Now I can't even see ya
You fell off, you have
