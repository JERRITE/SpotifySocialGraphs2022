I Was Made for Loving You Lyrics[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
A dangerous plan, just this time
A stranger's hand clutched in mine
I'll take this chance, so call me blind
I've been waiting all my life

[Pre-Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Please don't scar this young heart
Just take my hand

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Hold me close through the night
Don't let me go, we'll be alright
Touch my soul and hold it tight
I've been waiting all my life

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I won't scar your young heart
Just take my hand

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

[Bridge: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
Please don't go, I've been waiting so long
Oh, you don't even know me at all
But I was made for loving you

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving youYou might also like28Embed
