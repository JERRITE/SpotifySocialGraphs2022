[Verse 1]
[Saint Louis]
Forced my eyes not to see reality
Creating excuses for not listening
I raised, I didn't react
But sooner or later I had to leave
[Debi Nova]
And my mother helped me, the vacuum threw me
He told me: "My bold, it is with good intention
I am your mother and I want to see you fly high
And you won't do it if I have you in my arms "
[Víctor Muñoz]
And I said: "How does this do this?
Leave my house, my family and my affections
[Sebastián Yatra]
Leave my land and my friends
Why not everyone comes with me? "
[Reymar Perdomo]
And I cried, shouted and kicked
But life made me understand
And I grabbed my guitar and my luggage
And I said: "Maduro pussy 'and your mother!"
[Choir: Reymar Perdomo, Raquel Sofía]
And I left (I left, I left)
I left (oh, I left)
With my head full of doubts, but I left

[Bridge: Raquel Sofia]
And here I am, believing in me
Remembering everything that one day was

[Verse 2]
[Fonseca]
Goodbye was hard at that terminal
I cried everything that in a year can cry
But I left the border
And Spain, which now is that my odyssey begins
[Juan Fernando Velasco]
They stole a suitcase, they took me
I stayed with the money because I had it in my hand
I continued pa'lante, pa 'back I do
If God put this to me it is because I can with this
[Santiago Cruz]
And so I continued, making night and day
I crossed four countries in five days
Running the trot, eating little
Speaking little and crying short
[Fanny Lu]
But I arrived, as everyone should know
Well this was watered in any way
I don't know if this is now, I don't know if this always
I don't know if this is little, for me it was enough

I left, (I left) I left (I left)
With my head full of doubts, but I left
With rage, with anger I left

[Bridge: Silvestre Dangond]
And here I am (and here I am), believing in me (believing in me)
Remembering everything that one day was

[Verse 3: Andrés Cepeda, Reymar Pedomo]
I don't stop, I'm still in the fight
Well, I'm still making music and people listen to me
Being immigrant is not fucking
And the one who says the opposite that he says it from the outside
Now I walk around the world releasing tears
Breathing deep, my flag in my hand
Because if we are all brothers
That we are Latin American product

[Choir: Reymar Perdomo & Raquel Sofía]
And I left, I left
With my head full of doubts, but I left

[Bridge: Silvestre Dangond, Sebastián Yatra]
And here I am, believing in me
Remembering everything that one day was
[Choir: Reymar Perdomo, Raquel Sofía & Debi Nova]
I left, I left
With my head full of doubts
(But I) but I left (I left)

[Bridge: Cáceres, Javier Ramírez]
Oh, here I am (here I am), believing in me (without losing faith)
Remembering everything, everything I was one day

[Outro]
I left (oh, I left; oh, I left; oh, I left)
I left (oh, I left; oh, I left; oh, I left)
I carry your light and your aroma inside me
I left
I left, but I'll come back
Remembering everything, of everything I someday went
I believe in me, I believe in you, I believe in the brave village
