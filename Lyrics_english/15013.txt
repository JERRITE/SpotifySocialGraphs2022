Die Born LyricsI am cold and I don't know why
Said you got to keep me warm
You will run, run from my eyes
They stare you down and make you burn
I am the king, the king of the jungle
I'm the little dog
Said the king of the jungle makes me humble

[Chorus]
I will not die born
And I will not go down
This is not my home
For any fears at all
Keep me running, keep me running wild
Keep me innocent
The sand is hot, yes it burns my feet
I'm a little tired
Don't know what I'm gonna do with this
I am gonna run
Make it worth my while

[Chorus x2]
I will not die born
And I will not go down
This is not my home
For any fears at all

Keep me running, keep me running wild
I am wild dog
Said it gets me high, it gets me around
Everybody's walls, I don't feel no pain
Cause I am numb, numb from the fall
Yeah it's hard for me to make a little change
I don't have to change at all

[Chorus x2]
I will not die born
And I will not go down
This is not my home
For any fears at allYou might also likeEmbed
