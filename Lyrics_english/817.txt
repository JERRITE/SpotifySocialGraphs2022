Is that when we are together, the universe is in favor (Wuoh)
Everything is so perfect

This does not take a short time, this takes a while
I enjoy your kisses
What a pleasure is to see you daily
Present in my calendar

And I like your body when with wins' my mouth looks at me
And I love kisses with which you lift me every day
And I am a fan of your body when with wins' I look at me
And I love kisses with which you lift me every day (OH-OH-OH)

[Verse 1]
And I just looked at you, since I saw you
I want to travel with you to Paris
Is that there is no passport to love you
And those kisses that you give me I want to return you
Go walking together through the city, all so natural (AH-AH-AH)
How easy you rise to me 'temperature, my love
If I'm with you everything goes better (hah-ah-ah)

And I love kisses with which you lift me every day
And I am a fan of your body when with wins' I look at me
And I love kisses with which you lift me every day (OH-OH-OH)
