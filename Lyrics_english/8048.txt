Translations中文Under Control Lyrics[Verse]
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

[Chorus]
Waitin' for the fire to light
Feelin' like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control
[Build]

[Drop]
We're under control

[Verse]
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

[Chorus]
Waitin' for the fire to light
Feelin' like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

[Build]

[Drop]
Waitin' for the fire to light
Feelin' like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control
We're under controlYou might also like17Embed
