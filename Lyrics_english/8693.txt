The Story in Your Eyes Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about our fortune
And I've decided that we're really not to blame
For the love that's deep inside us now
Is still the same
And the sound we make together
Is the music to the story in your eyes
It's been shining down upon you now, I realize
[Chorus]
Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We're part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
That the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain
[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We're part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
That the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain

[Outro]
When the final line is over
And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall
I can hide inside your sweet, sweet love
Forevermore
