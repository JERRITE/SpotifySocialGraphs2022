Learn from This Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've come so close it's almost hard to believe
When you're up close it blinds you brilliantly
Just one rush can change your life forever
Just one push can end it altogether
Why can't we learn from the plague that surrounds us?
A glance at you and me

[Chorus]
Learn from my mistakes
Learn from this mistake
Learn from our mistake
Learn from their mistakes
[Verse 2]
There's no shoulder to cry on when you have no shame
There's no finger to point when you are to blame
Open book in my eyes shows you rain, then storming
I can't look when covered by the nothing and the suffering

[Chorus]
Learn from my mistakes
Learn from this mistake
Learn from our mistake
Learn from their mistakes, yeah
(Learn from my mistake)
(Learn from my mistake)
(Learn from my mistake)
(Learn from my mistake)

[Verse 3]
Believe me all my friends, in the ending of the story
There's no junkie out there with a happy ending
It consumes you and haunts you like the devil
It's the art of the process that kills off all the rebels
And that's me

[Chorus]
Learn from this mistake
Learn from my mistake
Learn from this mistake
Learn from our mistake

Yeah, yeah, yeah, my mistake
My mistake, my mistake, my mistakeEmbed
