Cheap Sunglasses Lyrics[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
You're packing magic in ah
You're making habits in ah
You're automatic, you are
The way you are
You're glitter sparkling in ah
You glow in the dark in ah
Make everybody go "ah"
The way you are
[Pre-Chorus: Matthew Koma]
Blue skies, white highs
Won't blind me, everything you hide
Your shades can't shade in the sunlight, in the sunlight

[Chorus: Matthew Koma]
Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of plastic
And you may seem like something classic
But you're cheap sunglasses
You're cheap sunglasses
And I'll see right through you
And I'll see right through you, you

[Verse 2: Matthew Koma]
You're so dramatic and ah
I want it badder than ah
You're super radical, ah
The way you are

You're double vision and ah
A new religion and ah
What hers and his and then ah
The way you are

[Pre-Chorus: Matthew Koma]
Blue skies, white highs
Won't blind me, everything you hide
Your shades can't shade in the sunlight, in the sunlight
You might also like[Chorus: Matthew Koma]
Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of plastic
You may seem like something classic
But you're cheap sunglasses
You're cheap sunglasses
And I'll see right through you
And I'll see right through you

[Chorus: Matthew Koma]
Your limousines get stuck in traffic
And we all know you're made of plastic
And you may seem like something classic
But you're cheap sunglasses
You're cheap sunglasses
And I'll see right through you
And I'll see right through you
And I'll see right through you
And I'll see right through you23Embed
