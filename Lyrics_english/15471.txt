The time of you Lyricses Easy to say "I'm going to miss you." 
 You feel to die, I can't fool 
 To a heart, which knew how to love 
 With another reason, apart from giving 

 I don't feel your voice, I don't listen to your speech 
 I feel that two is an odd number 
 I can't keep up without breathing 
 Understand that I just want to get 

 CHORUS: 
 I can't fly if your steps are not 
 That they fill the time of you 
 I don't want to fly 
 Without extinguishing your arms 
 And you feel the breeze on your face 
 And get wet from me 
 It's easy to say "I will come tomorrow" 
 I can't pretend that I'm going to be fine 
 I can't keep up without breathing 
 Understand that I just want to get 

 CHORUS: 
 I can't fly if your steps are not 
 That they fill the time of you 
 I don't want to fly 
 Without extinguishing your arms 
 And you feel the breeze on your face 
 And get wet from me 

 CHORUS: 
 I can't fly if your steps are not 
 That have the time of you 
 (Fill you time) 
 I don't want to fly 
 Without extinguishing your arms 
 And you feel the breeze on your face 
 And you get wet from meyou might also likembed
