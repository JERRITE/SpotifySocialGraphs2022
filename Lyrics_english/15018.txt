Where I Stand Lyrics[Chorus]
I have seen a thousand things
A thousand minds and what they bring
To this world and to this home
But where I stand, well, I don't know

[Verse 1]
I'm an open book, I'll tell you everything I know
To the darkest corners of my mind
My kingdom is wide
So wide-eyed I can't track the time between the spaces of my mind
[Chorus]
'Cause I have seen a thousand things
A thousand minds and what they bring
To this world and to this home
But where I stand, well, I don't know

[Verse 2]
I have little trouble walking
In directions I don't know of
And I'm walking and I'm walking blind

[Chorus]
'Cause I have seen a thousand things
A thousand minds and what they bring
To this world and to this home
But where I stand, well, I don't know
And people come and people go, people I will never know
But if I did and if I could, I'd wonder when and where they stood

[Chorus]
'Cause I have seen a thousand things
A thousand minds and what they bring
To this world and to this home
But where I stand, well, I don't knowYou might also like4Embed
