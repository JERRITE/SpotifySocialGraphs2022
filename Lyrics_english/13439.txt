Someone more lyrics [letter from "someone else"]

[Verse 1]
For the taste that your kisses bring
I know they have been in another mouth
I thought you weren't one of those
You see how one is wrong
You're going to say that they are jealousy
And make me look like crazy

[Pre-car]
And although as much I have silent
I also have something to tell you
[Chorus]
I already have someone else waking up in my skin
And it is so out of the ordinary, making me feel good
You'll be delirious for me
But don't try to force, that ends here

[Verse 2]
I do not plan to fight
And you can stay with her
With her, with her, or her
I'm going to forget you
And you're going to look for me
In her, in her, or her

[Pre-car]
And although as much I have silent
I also have something to tell you

[Chorus]
I already have someone else waking up in my skin
And it is so out of the ordinary, making me feel good
You'll be delirious for me
But don't try to force, that ends here

[Bridge]
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, taratatara

I already have someone else waking up in my skin
And it is so out of the ordinary, making me feel good
You'll be delirious for me
But don't try to force, that ends here

[Outro]
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, taratatara
Taratatara, Taratatara1embed
