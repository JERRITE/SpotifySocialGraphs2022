[Verse 1]
You tell me that it is not true that you die for me
If it's true that you don't like
They told me that you love that they die for you
Looking for the one who falls in love to do so suffer
[Pre-car]
If you tell me that you love me I will not believe you, no
You tell me that you love me and you can't be faithful, no
You left me driving alone and sad woman, no
I confess if you want to know, if you want to know, Yeh

[Chorus]
Treacherous, I don't care what you love me
Liar, you just want love to die
Treacherous, in my life you were passenger
Liar, I don't care that love you die

Ohh, ohh
Liar, I don't care that love you die

[Pre-car]
You keep dancing reggaeton, ton, ton
And you don't care at all who feels the heart
You just care about your pants, lon, lon
And you can see your evil intention from afar
And look, it's not so easy
Falling me was never so easy
When you are close to me it is not easy
And life became difficult
Just for you

Treacherous, I don't care what you love me
Liar, you just want love to die
Treacherous, in my life you were passenger
Liar, I don't care that love you die

[Bridge]
You tell me that it is not true that you die for me
If it's true that you don't like

[Chorus]
Treacherous, I don't care what you love me

Ohh, ohh
Liar, I don't care that love you die
