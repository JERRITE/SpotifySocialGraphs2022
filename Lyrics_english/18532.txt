You and I Lyrics[Intro]
(You and I)
(You and I)

[Verse 1]
I know it's warmer where you are
And it's safer by your side
But right now, I can't be what you want
Just give it time

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you and I can make it through the night (Oh-oh-oh)
And if you and I can keep our love alive, we'll find
[Chorus]
We can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I
For you and I

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Hey!
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
I know it's cold when we're apart
And I hate to feel this die
But you can't give me what I want
Just give it time

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you and I can make it through the night
And if you and I can keep our love alive, we'll find
You might also like[Chorus]
We can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I
For you and I

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Hey!
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
But for now, we stay so far
'Til our lonely limbs collide
I can't keep you in these arms
So I'll keep you in my mind (Reachin' out)
But for now, we stay so far (Freakin' out)
'Til our lonely limbs collide (Reachin' out)
I can't keep you in these arms (Freakin' out)
So I'll keep you in my mind
[Chorus]
Can we meet in the middle?
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I
For you and I
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Hey!
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
