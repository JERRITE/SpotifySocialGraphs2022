Tobacco and Chanel Lyrics [lyrics of "Tobacco and Chanel"]

[Verse I]
A smell of tobacco and chanel
It reminds me of the smell of your skin
A mixture of honey and coffee
It reminds me of the taste of their kisses
The color of the end of the night
He asks me where I went
Where are you?
That this only lives once
Where did you go? where are you?
[Chorus]
A smell of tobacco and chanel
And a mixture of honey and coffee
They ask me about her (she)
They ask me about her
The stars also ask me
They claim to return to her
Oh, come back for her (she)
Oh, to return to her

[Verse II]
A rose that did not bloom
But that time does not wither it
A promised flower, a love that was not
But that is still alive
And again the color of the end, at the end of the night
He asks where I went
That this only lives once
Where did you go? Where are you?

[Chorus]
A smell of tobacco and chanel
And a mixture of honey and coffee
They ask me about her (she)
They ask me about her
The stars also ask me
They claim to return to her
Oh, come back for her (she)
Oh, to return to her

But they were the same stars
That one day - marked my hands
And the flower took away that flower from my life
Of my life

[Chorus]
A smell of tobacco and chanel
And a mixture of honey and coffee
They ask me about her (she)
They ask me about her
The stars also ask me
They claim to return to her
Oh, come back for her (she)
Oh, to return to her

Don't leave, don't forget
Don't leave, don't forget
Na ra na ra naembed
