Forgive me lyrics ["forgive me" letter]

[Intro]
This is the big one

[Chorus]
And Baby forgive me, Yeh (-Don me; Yeh)
If I left your life (I went)
And although more than anyone I loved you, Yeh (I loved you; Yeh)
I'm not for you today
And Baby forgive me, Yeh (-Don me; Yeh)
If I left your life (I went)
And although more than anyone I loved you, Yeh (I loved you; Yeh)
I'm not for you today (EH-EH-EH)
[Verse 1]
And now the time ', the day' are cold '
The truth I swear I don't know what to do
I am involved in a mess with me and with you that I have not been able to solve
You did not believe that after leaving I was not going to come back
Today all that could not be; UH-OH, EY
We enrred ourselves in a game of two, ey (two)
But this time he lost the one who bet the most, uh (opted)
They say love makes you feel better, ey (feel better)
But not if you love and the other no, hey (no)
Drowning penalties to forget (-Vidar)
But I see that they already learned to swim (na ')
Looking for something that I know is not, he
'Toy by your side and I wake up again
And although this I hate
Mommy, seriously sorry
But I don't come back (ey-ey)
There are no pretexts, this is this (like this, this)
Forgive me

[Chorus]
And Baby forgive me, Yeh (-Don me; Yeh)
If I left your life (I went)
And although more than anyone I loved you, Yeh (I loved you)
I'm not for you today (OH-OH)
And Baby forgive me, Yeh (-Don me; Yeh)
If I left your life (I went)
And although more than anyone I loved you, Yeh (-am√©; Yeh)
I'm not for you today (EH-EH-EH)
