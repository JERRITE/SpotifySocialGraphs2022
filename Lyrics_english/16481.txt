Sweet Little Mystery LyricsBaby, baby, baby
Baby
Just you and me
Tell me baby

My love has taken a tumble
Ooh
But I'm still standing

You're such a natural
Sing
That's what you are
Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now
Baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
That makes me try

It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
Check my bootey
Didn't I come
Insisting a side of wonder
Didn't I come
Resting a higher decision
Didn't I come
Insisting a side of wonder to your life?

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now
Baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong

It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
Sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
That makes me try
Sweet little mystery that makes me try
That makes me try
Try, try
Oh
Just think of the magic ooh-ooh
Don't think it is tragic
Hey-hey-hey
Just think of the magic
Come on listen:
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
You might also likeCome on listen:
My love has taken a tumble
But I'm still standing

If you had only, only, only ...
Love me like you use to do

Just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
Come on listen:
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Com'on, com'on, com'on
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumbleEmbed
