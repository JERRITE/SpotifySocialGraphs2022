Flesh from Bone Lyrics[Verse 1]
My reality
Flawed you oppress me
Immortality whored by God
As the claws are left in me

My insanity
Fallen dignity
Whored by God
As we're drenched in slavery
[Chorus]
Peeling skin flesh from bone
Dealing sin, none shall roam
See the righteous fall
At the rise of the damned, denied
See others crawl
In the hour demand and fight

[Post-Chorus]
Unto deadly sin I fall
Praise to deadly sin!

[Verse 2]
My reality
Flawed you oppress me
Immortality, whored by God
As the claws are left in me

[Chorus]
Peeling skin flesh from bone
Dealing sin, none shall roam
See the righteous fall
At the rise of the damned, denied
See others crawl
To the towers of rancid spite
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
To the deadly king I fall
To the deadly king!Embed
