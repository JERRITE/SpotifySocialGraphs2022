Discard Lyrics ["Discard치" letter]

[Chorus]
You see it ', you see it', you see it '
You see it 'in a corner Soli치'
Corner 'as if it doesn't happen Nah
You see it, you see it, you see it
Memo, tell me if you see it
You see it in a corner Soli치 '
Corner 'as if it doesn't happen Nah
[Post-car]
Play with your hair, your fabric looks good
I have it in candle
I'm going there first, uoh-uoh

[Verse 1]
You see it as if it doesn't happen Nah
In the corner, like what kitchen
As we said Horita
Crazy, crazy, loquita
Remove remove
I put it and she removes it
Remove remove
I put it and she removes it
Remove remove
I put it and she removes it
Bold, beautiful
What's your name?
My name is Yomo, how?
I'm really berto
In this an expert
Mama, I'm looking for a cemetery
Because I have to bury a dead dead tonight
Give him, nine day '
You, I want you to be mine
In my bedroom, camera
Hey, looks 'turns away', ga-ga
You, Gaga already (gaga already), crazy pa'l ca치 '
Hey, you know that you are darling
Do not be guils my sister
You are not fine, you are a shameless
You Might Also Like [Interlude]
You don't guille '
Your body makes styl
I doubt that since I shine

[Chorus]
Discard, in a postal corner
Hand in the hair, with little fabric
From here the veil, she is in heat
Corner 'in a postal corner'
Hand in the hair
Tra, trara, tra, tra, trra
Me too? Here the veil and I hit him from behind

[Verse 2]
Simple I tell the ear
Hey has a friend for my friend
That walks with me and this misresses'
Soliao ', single, I have me lao'
Vamo 'there and start letting go, what should?
Tell me, what do you want to take?
A drink, I invite you, go for house, what happens?
Let's leave ourselves' and Guasa

[Bridge]
You came for the album to kill you
Give him, I'm going to kill you, ma '
You came for the album to kill you
Give him, I'm going to kill you, ma '
Ask, more ', ma', I'm going to kill you, ma '
I'm going to kill you, ma '
I'm going to kill you, ma '
Don't sleep, hey!
[Chorus]
Discard, in a post -corner '
Hand in the hair, with little fabric
From here the veil, she is in heat
Corner 'in a postal corner'
Hand in the hair
Tra, trara, tra, tra, trra, tra, tra, trra

[Verse 2]
It is not ', it is not' eat shit
Teach me what you have under
Let's go to the fuck, (leave me a la'o)
This is my job
Enreda'o, improvisa'o
Mommy, you know you have me well motivated me

[Outro]
My chest wants to get out of my heart
I am losing the notion of time
And the wind blowing, of the air conditioning
And you by my side, the two desperate '
In an intense, crazy, meso, mama
Silence, suspense, shhh
For a moment, a moment
You did not know that I am a singer
Hears! I have kids in the bank
Sometimes even tranco!
I Don's Fuck, Crazy!
I play the sky for little
You and me, you and me
Me and you, you and me
You and me, me, me
I and you, you, you
You and me, me, me
Me and you
In a corner
She used to play with her hair, beautiful
Like a flash of heaven, falling a fleeting star
I am able to more than you think capable
You escape
Mommy, I put a trap
Rumpa
Rumpa, Rumpa
Rumpa, Rumpa
Break the album
Mistale your gistro
Cortita skirt
Ma ', you don't take off
You are pretty
It is close
And I invite you a swallow with me, sister
I have my panas by my side, Memo Riz
And this are victorism, victorism (victorism, victorism) embed
