The Kiss of Venus Lyrics[Chorus]
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glow

[Verse 1]
Then I asked her, have you read the paper? Okay
People talking about which side they're taking
And if you know, then, baby, what's your take on it?
Does it make you wanna leave?
'Cause I could look the other way for you
[Chorus]
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
Scored a bullseye in the early morning glow, yeah

[Bridge]
Reflеcted mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or widе awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
Or would we stay awake?

[Verse 2]
Have you (Oh, I asked you) read the paper? (Oh, I asked you)
People talking without no education, yeah
Look, go to college (College), go find your major (Major)
Realize you're minor in the scheme of everything

[Chorus]
The kiss of Venus (Well, the kiss of Venus) has got me on the go (The kiss of Venus)
Scored a bullseye in the early morning glow, yeah

[Outro]
Well, the kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glowYou might also like9Embed
