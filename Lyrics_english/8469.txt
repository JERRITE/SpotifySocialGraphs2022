Dancing I want to see them Lyrics [lyrics by "Dancing I want to see them"]

[Verse 1]
I am a tempo
Without discussion, the revelation of the moment
Song by song, walk, female, báilame
I know that the rhythm is uncontrollable
It is not an obligation, but you are so kind
Please dance my song and if you don't dance, you miss it
Girl! I am the Green Eyed Cat
Woman, I know you wanted to see me
Tempo, a pleasure of meeting him
Dance! And don't cohíba
When they look at you, your alleged friends are filled with envy
And I bet that e 'because you have more body
I'm loose, you're loose
I'm easy, you revolt
[Pre-car]
Girl, send, yal
I have reggae, they send the women '
They are the ones that dominate, without any discussion
I have reggae, they send the women '
They are the ones that dominate

[Chorus]
Where are the girls? Dancing I want to see them
I'm going to make them mine 'and entertain them
Where are the girls? Dancing I want to see them
I'm going to make them mine 'and entertain them

[Post-car]
If e 'what they want, take, take!
That reggae is in fashion
The others who listen and eat, eat
That reggae is in fashion
If e 'what they want, take, take!
That reggae is in fashion
The others who listen and eat, eat
That reggae is in fashion

[Bridge]
I know that the rhythm is uncontrollable
In 40, in 40, in the 41 of Play
The others who listen and eat, eat
I am the Green Eyed Cat
If e 'what they want, take, take!
I have reggae, they send the women '
I'm the cat, I'm the cat, I'm the cat with boots

I'm one of the people who do everything with music
For the ladies to get hysterical
They go crazy with the sound that the DJ plays
And if it causes me, I kiss her on the mouth
I am the cat with boots, tempo!
If you fall into my claws, girl
I will touch your guitar body
And I am the cat with boots
And look to see if I don't notice that I'm the real one who whips
The one who explodes note in the 41 of Playe, causing the girls to take off their clothes

[Chorus]
Where are the girls? Dancing I want to see them
I'm going to make them mine 'and entertain them
Where are the girls? Dancing I want to see them
I'm going to make them mine 'and entertain themBed
