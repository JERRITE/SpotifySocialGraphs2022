My Crew Lyrics [Words of "My Crew" ft. Nemir]

[Intro]
Biggie Jo on the Beat

[Verse 1: S. black pri]
I got into the box, it's the bendo
DJ makes sound to see women shine
Me, during this time, I turn on my bédo
And my tickets can count by thousands
[Bridge: S. Black Pri]
A million enemies but what she wants is to follow my crew
A million troubles but it wants, it's following my crew

[Pre-refrain: Nemir]
Ana or Yak, or Ya Galbi
3Aynek FI 3AYNI
Wa yeh yeh
Goulili Kif N'Dir (Goulili)
Ah, Nari Nari
Han, haan

[Refrain: Nemir]
Habibti Matkhalinich Edini
Ana Baghik nti, wa habeltini
Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye
Wa ye, ye, ye, ye, ye
Ma 3ndi Win Nroh, Ma 3ndi wali
Be3Dou Ghir Nchoufek, wesh dani?
Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye, Ye
Wa ye, ye, ye, ye, ye

[Verse 2: S. black pri]
Sit in my table, there is Belvedere,
Yohji yamamoto, givenchy, lv life
It crawls, the negro loses the sight
No, does not speak Chinese, my friend, gives my due
Three-quarters of these negros are die
My cigarette, I crush it in the ashtray
This bitch wants to find the flaw
She would like to drink rosé champagne
I'm with my gavas, posed
It dances on reggae dancehall
She wins on me as if I were Sean Paul

Wa ye, ye, ye, ye, ye

[Bridge: S. Black Pri]
She would like to dance all night
Me, I want her to make me forget
All my disappointments, my problems, my troubles, my regrets
I just want to forget
She would like to dance all night
Me, I want her to make me forget
All my disappointments, my problems, my troubles, my regrets
I just want to forget
