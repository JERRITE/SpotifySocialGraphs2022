Necroshine LyricsYou can take me out of my Hell
You can't take the Hell on out of me

Watch me here as I get up
But be careful what you see

I cut across the waste
Some live and some enshrined
I look into the light of the necroshine
Don't you worry about me
You know I'm doing fine
Basking in the light of the necroshine
In the name of all that's sacred
In the name of misery

Watch me here as I turn red
But remember what you see

I hunger for a taste
To fill my glass with wine
Away from the light, into the necroshine
Don't you ever doubt me
As you walk the line
Guided by the light of the necroshine

I think that I have been reborn
Just a little better than before
I think I tried to tell myself
That I needed just a little more

They always tried to sell me
Hang me what I couldn't use
Always tried to get a little better
With an offer that I can't refuse

You can take me full of fire
You can take me as you find
Or you can leave me here
Where you gonna see me
Guided by the necroshine
Necroshine, necroshine
Necroshine
You might also likeDon't you worry about me
You know I'm doing fine
Basking in the light of the necroshine
Don't you ever doubt me
As you walk the line
Guided by the light
Guided by the light of the necroshine1Embed
