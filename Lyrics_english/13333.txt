Alexis Texas Lyrics[Hook]
Alexis Texas, Alexis Texas
Alexis Texas, Alexis Texas

[Verse 1]
You make me wanna take off all of my clothes
You make me wanna show you where that thing goes
You make me wanna dive into all that snow
You make me stay out all night and catch a cold

[Pre-Chorus]
(Rich) Never felt so sweet, never ride no skiis like this before
(Rich) Never been fucked up, never lined it up like this before
(Rich) Never felt so sweet, you pass the key, unlock my heart
(Rich) Don't know who you are but I love you on that Escobar
[Chorus]
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces, cartilage wasted away
Tell me you love me, baby, quit asking my name
Washing regret and adrenaline swept down the drain
Lovely, lovely, lovely, floating away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Rich) Never felt so sweet, never ride no skiis like this before
(Rich) Never been fucked up, never lined it up like this before
(Rich) Never felt so sweet, you pass the key, unlock my heart
(Rich) Don't know who you are but I love you on that Escobar

[Chorus]
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars

I'mma bring a white girl, always do it right girl
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back
I'll still be ya brown girl, never let you down girl
You come back for more, dreaming, feigning more

I'll still be ya brown girl, never let you down girl
You come back for more, dreaming, feigning more

[Chorus]
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Powder my nose I'm going out tonight, out tonight, out tonight
Me and my best friend go wild in the West End
You and my best friend, we cowboys and angels
Red lights stay blinking, we movie stars, movie stars
