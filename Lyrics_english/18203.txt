Brave Face Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and get ready for the end of the world
Put on your best clothes, take a deep breath
Don't bury your head and draw yourself up tall

It might hurt a bit but don't you forget that
This, too, shall pass, if we survive
So put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
[Chorus]
Make me a promise that when the world ends
You'll kiss me and you'll hold my hand
And then we'll get through this, whatever happens
One look at your brave face makes me a braver man

[Verse 2]
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
It's funny how fear can bring your focus in tight
Don't be ashamed, we all shoulder some blame
For the way that nothing ever really turned out right

The world is a mess now, baby, it's best now
If we start again with new visions in mind
So put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side

[Bridge]
If we have to do this, let's do it smiling
And I won't let it show that my hands are shaking
We're gonna die like kings and queens
Though we live like beggars
So put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and let's go down together

[Chorus]
Make me a promise that when the world ends
You'll kiss me and you'll hold my hand
And then we'll get through this, whatever happens
One look at your brave face makes me a braver man
You might also like[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Now if we have to do this, then let's do it smiling
And I won't let it show that my hands are shaking
We're gonna die like kings and queens
Though we live like beggars
So put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and let's go down together

[Chorus]
Make me a promise that when the world ends
You'll kiss me and you'll hold my hand
And then we'll get through this, whatever happens
One look at your brave face makes me a braver man

[Outro]
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
(Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side)
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
(Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side)
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other side
Put on your brave face, honey, your brave face
Honey, and we'll make it to the other sideEmbed
