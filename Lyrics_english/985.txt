[Intro: Alexander Delgado & Randy Malcom]
Hahaha
Enrique Iglesias (One Love, One Love!)
Zone people!
Desmer

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias & Randy Malcom]
I look at you and my breath cuts
When you look at me, my heart rises
I slow my heart
And in a silence your gaze says a thousand words (UH)
The night I beg you not to sunbathe
[Choir: Alexander Delgado & Randy Malcom]
Dancing dancing)
Dancing dancing)
Your body and mine
Filling the void
Up and down (up and down)
Dancing dancing)
Dancing dancing)
That fire inside
I am crazy
I am saturated

[Post-Coro: Enrique Iglesias & Alexander Delgado]
With your physics and chemistry
Also your anatomy
Beer and tequila
And your mouth with mine
I can no longer (I can't anymore)
I can no longer (I can't anymore)
With this melody
Your color, your fantasy
With your philosophy
My head is empty
And I can't anymore (I can't anymore)
I can no longer (I can no longer)

I want to be with you
Live with you, dance with you
Have a crazy night (one crazy night)
Oh, kiss your mouth (and kiss your mouth)
I want to be with you
Live with you, dance with you
Have a crazy night
With tremendous note

[Harmonization: Randy Malcom]

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias & Randy Malcom]
You look at me and take me to another dimension
(I'm in another dimension)
Your beats accelerate to my heart
(Your beats accelerate to my heart)
What irony of destiny not to be able to touch you (Wuh!)
Hug you, and feel the magic of your smell
