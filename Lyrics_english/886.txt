TranslationEnglishmucha Data Lyrics [Lyrics for "Much Data"]

[Chorus]
(Hi Hi?)
My answering machine tells you
If I don't attend the phone, surely I don't want to talk to VO '
(Bitch? Bitch?)
And all 'the best (Wuh!)
In your life you will not know any gang like me (me)

[Verse 1]
Those businesses no longer interest me
If until recently Pichea-Ban
I have the paca on the table, you interrupted while
Whore (whore), ha, fucking but not taled
I should be a lawyer, no play escapes me
9-8-0k, only in January, Pa '
In the year they are one hundred more '
It rains money, I want more '
"I want more ', I want more, I want more'"
He calls me, says "I want more '"
"I want more ', I want more, I want more'"
For you
[Chorus]
(Hi Hi?)
My answering machine tells you
If I don't attend the phone, surely I don't want to talk to VO '
(Bitch? Bitch?)
And all 'the best (Wuh!)
In your life you will not know any gang like me, Jah
(Hi Hi?)
My answering machine tells you
If I don't attend the phone, surely I don't want to talk to VO '
(Bitch? Bitch?)
And all 'the best (Wuh!)

[Verse 2]
What do I do like me
Have what I
He lives by throwing, but he is trying to do it like me, huh
I left so much that all 'your' cat 'hated me, today they worship me
She puts herself if I talk about money and converts the insult in compliment
He looks at me as if he were crazy, and what?
To silence his mouth I already got used to
Acting as if I knew they know what I know
I don't fight for leather, mommy, stay with him

[Pre-stribe]
I already tried it, I discarded it; It was not so much
I stole it, I kidnapped it, lost the charm
What do I call who? I don't know who e ', wants to forget but now I stuck
And now even his 'baby' loves me, from the La Chief neighborhood that is playing, Bitch (ey)
