Alone (tofû Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am not alone
Her lipstick stains my neck and shoulders all night long
She does it for fun
She puts her twisted words
In the back of a loaded gun

[Chorus]
I'm set in stone
Where you go I go
We’re so out of sight, we can't see the light
Can't find my way home
I feel so alone
Where did it all go?
I’m so out of sight, I can't see the light
Can't find my way home
I feel so alone, oh
[Post-Chorus]
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh

[Drop]
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh

[Verse 2]
Don't reload, I'm all out of trust
I don't know where else I can run
Falling down, who can pick me up?
'Cause this girl is heartless, heartless
Back and run when you find the truth
Steal your soul with one look at you
Lips dark red like the blood she drew
'Cause this girl is heartless

[Chorus]
I’m set in stone
Where you go I go
We’re so out of sight, we can't see the light
Can’t find my way home
I feel so alone
Where did it all go?
I'm so out of sight, I can't see the light
Can't find my way home

I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone

[Drop]
Alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone, oh
I feel so alone

[Outro]
I feel so aloneEmbed
