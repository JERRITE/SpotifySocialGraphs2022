​ilym (remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: John K]
I miss you already
And you're not even gone
I wanna call you
We just hung up the phone
I wrote you a letter
And I threw it away
No matter how small I write it
There's always so much more to say

[Pre-Chorus: John K]
I'm not sayin' it's a competition
All I'm sayin' is
[Chorus: John K]
I love you more than the bad days ahead
I love you more than the nights that we ended with slammin' doors
Oh, I love you more
There will be times when your heart will forget
So I'll say it over and over again
So you know for sure
Darlin', I love you

[Verse 2: ROSIE]
More than thе movies
That make me tеar up
Even Harry and Sally
Noah and Allie have nothing on us (Have nothing on us)

[Pre-Chorus: ROSIE]
And I'm not sayin' it's a competition
If it was, we'd win

[Chorus: John K & ROSIE, ROSIE]
I love you more than the bad days ahead (Bad days ahead)
I love you more than the nights that we ended with slammin' doors
Oh, I love you more
There will be times when your heart will forget (There will be times)
So I'll say it over and over again
So you know for sure
Darlin', I love you more
You might also like[Post-Chorus: John K & ROSIE]
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo (Oh-oh, ooh, woah)
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo (Ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: John K & ROSIE]
I'll love you more as the years pass us by
If you ever doubt it, just look in my eyes
And you'll know for sure

[Chorus: John K & ROSIE, ROSIE]
I love you more than the bad days ahead (Bad days ahead)
I love you more than the nights that we ended with slammin' doors
Oh, I love you more
There will be times when your heart will forget (There will be times)
So I'll say it over and over again
So you know for sure
Darlin', I love you more

[Post-Chorus: John K & ROSIE]
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
I love you more (Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo)

[Outro: John K]
I love you more4Embed
