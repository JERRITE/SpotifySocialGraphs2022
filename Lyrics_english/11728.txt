Hang on Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you're probably sleepin'
I got this thing I keep thinkin'
Yeah, I admit I been drinkin'
The void is back and unblinkin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot stop the airplane from crashin'
And we circle down from the sky

[Chorus]
Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me, hang on me
'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
[Verse 2]
I know you hate my hysterics
I promise this time is different
I won't cry wolf in the kitchen
Just please, oh, please don't hang up yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot stop the taxi cab from crashin'
And only lovers will survive

[Chorus]
Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me, hang on me
'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this worldYou might also like5Embed
