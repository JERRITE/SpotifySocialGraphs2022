Sweet tuesday morning - 2010 - remaster LyricsSweet Tuesday morning came on your smile
All of my fears, they have left me
Sweet Tuesday morning came on your smile
Love is the answer you gave me
I've been to places all around, astound me
I've seen the breaking of the souvenir
In a brightness I can feel, surround me
It's the first time I felt it for years
Sweet Tuesday morning came on your smile
Love is the answer you gave me
I've been to places all around, astound me
I've seen the breaking of the souvenir
In a brightness I can feel, surround me
It's the first time I felt it for yearsYou might also likeEmbed
