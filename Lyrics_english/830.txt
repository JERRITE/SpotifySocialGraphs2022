I don't fall down, I'm still standing
You can find me on Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday friday
Hey

[Verse 1: Drefgold]
Kngl, I don't change flag (Skrrt)
They are Francesco Totti and Alex Del Piero (Skrt)
Just by making money without thoughts (Skrt)
Always perennial rolling when evening arrives (Okay)
Siroppo falls low like the MD (hey)
I just drink Makatussin in the glass
Only twenty years that in this world I'm standing (Komparema)
It's not that I stayed with twenty ya-ya teeth
Don't tell me to me if you are an incompetent, Yah-Yah
I run with the bitch towards the plug that I make meta ya-ya
You know they are not competition
You can call me, talk to me, tell me your experiences, okay
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Gigi above the beat there are those who pretended nothing
I do eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Ah-Uh, Ah, the words are simple (okay)

[Refrain: Drefgold]
Low -falling syrup like the MD
I don't fall down, I'm still standing
You can find me on Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, always on the same wave
Low -falling syrup like the MD
I don't fall down, I'm still standing
You can find me on Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, always on the same wave

Drugs, fashion, pink my soda (Skrt)
Call Uber to return to the area (Skrt, Skrt)
We do not count anything but we count many
Billion Headz Money Money Money (Yah, Yah, Yah, hey, hey)
I don't know anyone who kills the Squad (Skrt)
The girl who aims for me to kill squats (Skrt-Skrt)
Amarena syrup, I have a dry throat, hey
She remained speechless, Uuh (Yah)
Bling as a star (Skrt), K in the Smart
Rollo six grams above the iPad, Uuh, Yah
His Chihuahua (Skrt-Skrt) hates me and as you bark (Skrt-Skrt)
My neck dazzles you
