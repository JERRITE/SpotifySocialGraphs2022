My baby fiu lyrics [lyrics by "my baby fiu fiu"]

[Intro: Tefi C.]
(Enroll me like this
With Endúlzame Powdered sugar
And you are my king
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu)

[Chorus: Tefi C.]
Chocolate carame, time like this
Like a showcase pionone, roll me up like this
With endúlz me powder sugar, and you are my king
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu
[Post-car: Tefi C.]
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu

[Verse 1: Tefi C.]
In my tears I looked at you
In my sorrows I kissed
In my caresses I drew you
Without seeing, from you I fell in love
How did I not know
If I had promised me again and again
I learned by heart that stupidity
"You better love you to love you"
Uhm, go immaturity
It was almost immediacy
In which I couldn't live without you one more day

[Chorus: Tefi C.]
Chocolate carame, time like this
Like a showcase pionone, roll me up like this
With endúlz me powder sugar, and you are my king
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu

[Post-car: Tefi C.]
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu

For me the most important of my life
The most important thing is my family
Family that I trained with Maribel, my wife, thirty years ago
The woman whom I love and the woman with whom I want to live until the last of my days (until the last of my days)

[Interlude: Tefi C. & Tito Silva]

I have lost my head for you
I'm no longer the fugitive bride
I've gone crazy about love
And I repeat it so that my smell is impregnated in you
(You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu)
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu

[Chorus: Tefi C.]
Chocolate carame, time like this
Like a showcase pionone, roll me up like this
With endúlz me powder sugar, and you are my king
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu

[Post-car: Tefi C.]
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu
[Outro: Tefi C.]
How handsome you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu
How handsome you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu fiu
How nice you are
You are my baby, my baby fiu1embed
