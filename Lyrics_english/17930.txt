XXXX Lyrics ["XXXX" letter]]

[Chorus]
Baby, it's not like before
Now we arrive and treat us as gangster '
If we go out, then, we spend a lot
If you shine 'it is because diamonds shine, Yeah
We are at another time (OH-OH-OH)
If Picheo is because my time has arrived
False smile, but I get violent
If I'm winning, why don't I see them happy? Yeah
[Verse]
I prefer to invoice, the one of you 'e' embarrassment
How many out there forced and mine and 'natural
These cabrone 'want flore' and did not put to sow
You fell with your corner, none copy again
And without a cojone 'I have if the studies to the a. m
These pyrobos border and nor sticks have
I'm with the blessing, the spoon told me not to stop me
What is down if it is more chimba what is coming?
Now in the house twenty Santa Claus arrives
I have the cat 'wet' listening to my voice
Breaking with Sky like the Bull 'of 92
Mounting it in Medallo as rock stars
(Gracia 'to God who was given to us)

[Bridge]
Random
Today in El Mercho and tomorrow at the Lambo
You do not even know what I have
They are neglected and already in this I lambo

[Chorus]
Because it's no longer like before
Now we arrive and treat us as gangster '
If we go out, then, we spend a lot
If you shine 'it's because diamonds shine, wow
We are at another time
If Picheo is because my time has arrived
False smile, but I get violent
If I'm winning, why don't I see them happy '? Wowyou mihht Also likembed
