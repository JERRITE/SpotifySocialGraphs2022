TranslationsPortuguêsSocial Climb Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come break some hearts now, tear them out
File in for amusements with the crowd
Oh, but be advised, participation is required
Doing things not typically allowed

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
[Verse 2]
Defend your factions, cut the lines
Leagues of social climbers are abound
Oh, but be advised, no restitution comes tonight
‘Less we lay unconscious in the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like we're having a good time
It's true, a wonderfully good time

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
(Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
When I'm with you
Hey!

[Bridge]
But if the lights don't stop me
No one's got control of what I do
