THE LIE (REMIX) LYRICS [LETTER OF "THE LIE (REMIX)" FT. Myke Towers, Cazzu & Rauw Alejandro]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro & Sech]
If yesterday does not 'ate' without the lights
How can you be possible to accuse me?
If I said "buy what you like"
And also as nobody put it to you, Yeh-Yeh (put; Yeh-Yeh)
This is the remix

[Pre-Coro: Rafa Pabön, Rafa Pabön & Sech, Rauw Alejandro]
Tell me what you expect from me
Do not believe (ra-rauw), woman, that I will wait for you
(I'll wait for you, Yeh)
Baby, time ends and I have to go (I have to go, Yeh)
Patience is exhausted and I will not insist (no, no; Yeh)
[Chorus: Brytiago, Sech & Cazzu]
And although I want, baby, I can't (I can't, oh)
Even if I die of desire (I die, oh)
You are not pa 'me for what I see (I know you are not for me; huh)
You lie, I know, but I believe you
Although I can, baby, no

[Verse 1: sech]
I don't believe you, and if you picheo
Take care that you fall in love 'of the fate of the' ugly '
I spend seeing you on Instagram, or I believe it
I make the madman that I don't wish you, but he texts you
"Hello, if you are not changing, stay alone"
It is better to lose you than to lose the hours
He told me "I love you" and it was embuste
Your bed is to blame that I like it '
I know it's not serious, I realized since I looked for her
He told me "I love you" and it was embuste
To your system you may adjust
But as no girlfriend, I don't dislike

[Verse 2: Brytiago]
I don't want a piece 'e you, I want you complete you
I love you complete, baby
I don't want to share you, I want you complete
I love you complete, baby
And I don't know what happens later 'from this beer
Let's see if I turn on one, for this headache
Hoping you will write to me because it really interests me
Although, I am your second table dish
And rise it to me
And then he does nothing, he rejects me
You are looking for you to take you up another sees'
And that breaks you again ', eh-eh

And although I want, baby, I can't (I can't, oh)
Even if I die of desire (I die, oh)
You are not pa 'me for what I see (I know you are not for me)
You lie, I know, but I believe you
Although I can, baby, no

[Verse 3: Myke Towers]
(Young Kingz, Baby)
The most famous lie of my 'exe' is that they forgot
That they already erased me, but they forced me
To take me to her friends, I win with them
Now it's Valentino, if not, Ferragamo
Don't call me, I call you
I thought I would navigate your waters and drowned in the plain
You did not put on your part, neither do I either from mine
That is why in the end Fallamlo '
Our love is condone '
You are the muse of the themes that one composes
The hotel rooms 'asked with Balcone'
And the reality of the case is that pa'l sex does not oppose
You still look for me
They say that when prohibited, he likes
I put it in pose 'that neither in Kamasutra
I own, she says that life and 'unfair
[Verse 4: Cazzu]
If you already know that I am the one who is killing the league
Why fuck 'go throwing my friends?
He says you love me, but I know that lies
Daddy, the world revolves and will return you
What you are doing wrong
And although you lie, you know it's not the same
He says not in the day, but at night I realized
That you threw the signal
I don't want to share you
I love you for me complete
If you want ', secretly
I'm not going to argue
But if you are playing
So my love also challenges you
Change 'The Booklet
And you're going to regret

[Choir: Cazzu, Sech, Brytiago, Rafa Pabön]
And although I want, baby, I can't (I can't, oh)
Even if I die of desire (I die, oh)
You are not pa 'me for what I see (I know you are not for me)
You lie, I know, but I believe you
You are not pa 'me for what I see

[Verse 5: Rafa Pabön]
You lie, but I know the truth
Your mentality does not go according to your age
It will be just one night, it will not be an eternity
If as you dance, you do it, I'm curious
And I swear what I treatment
I reveal my portrait
Whiskey bottles, hooka, tobacco
I try to get you out of my mind and I don't get you
It was an assault, a robbery

[Bridge: Rafa Pabön]
Tell me what you feel woman
Trust me, nobody will know, baby
We have little time to lose
You play with me and I'm not going to fall again

[Verse 6: Rauw Alejandro]
(RA-RAUW)
You have no mercy (no, no)
And suddenly you go (ey)
EY How important will it be?
The message that came to you that you do not let you see (Rah!)
I am not for this, to hell your pretext '
Pa 'get the hatred inside a perreo from that' (Wuh)
That on the wall have me imprisoned
Until the night makes me forget about you (ah)
But, out of nowhere, your memory returns to me (uh-wuh!)
You are the only one who wins on top 'and me (y-y)
Today I want to do it
As he sees' on the balcony, huh
But I don't know who I lie
If I never had your heart, huh

[Choir: Rafa Pabön, Sech, Brytiago, Cazzu]
And although I want, baby, I can't (I can't, oh)
Even if I die of desire (I die, oh)
You are not pa 'me for what I see (I know you are not for me)
You lie, I know, but I believe you
You are not pa 'me for what I see
