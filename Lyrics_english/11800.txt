When you return Lyricsno I know what will happen when you return
When I see you again
I don't know if we will feel the same yet
With its uncertainties variants time I pass
I just hope you like me
You still die for being with me
And you miss the air when I look at you
You still laugh at my nonsense
And that you still feel part of your life
I still die for being with you
And that still remember all your paths
I still get lost among your fantasies
And that you still feel part of my life
I just hope you like me let's continue
In love, in love
I don't know what's going to happen when you come back
And be in front of you again
If you see that our case is lost
There will be no culprits, do not avoid looking at me
The weather passed
I just hope you like me
You still die for being with me
And you miss the air when I look at you
You still laugh at my nonsense
And that you still feel part of your life
I still die for being with you
And that still remember all your paths
I still get lost among your fantasies
And that you still feel part of my life
I just hope you like me let's continue
In love, in love
I don't know what will happen when you return ... You Might Also Likeembed
