Donâ€™t Hang Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm lying all alone
The pillow is all I have to hold
Can't feel you, God, it isn't fair
Without you, I still wanna to take you there

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you
I'm not alone
[Chorus]
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when i'm lonely
And now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Verse 2]
Tell me (tell me)
Tell me what you see
Feel me (can you feel me?)
Feel me on my knee
Slowly, we begin to breathe
Hold on, hold on to your leash

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you
I'm not alone

[Chorus]
(Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely
And now I'm coming too (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

You're far way, we'll find a way
Ooh baby, now, let's make it right
Close your eyes (damn)

[Pre Chorus]
Don't hang up
It's just gettin' serious (damn)
You're making me delirious
Don't hang up
Until I'm finished with you

[Chorus]
I'm not alone (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely
And now i'm coming too (Don't hang up)
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too

[Outro]
Don't hang up
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Do you feel me too?
Even when I'm lonely
Close your eyes
And now I'm coming too
I am not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming too2Embed
