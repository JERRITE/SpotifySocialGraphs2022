Suicidal, I'll die for my brothers
When that motherfuckin' 4-5 bust
Flick all, flick all, let that motherfucker dump, dump, dump
Homicide ride for my
Suicidal, I'll die for my brothers
When that motherfuckin'
Let that motherfucker bust
And if it be homicide I'm ready to ride for my brothers
Suicidal, I'll die for my brothers
When that motherfuckin' 4-5 bust
Aye, aye, aye, aye
[Hook]
And if it be homicide I'm ready to ride for my brothers
Suicidal, I'll die for my brothers
When that motherfuckin' 4-5 bust
Flick all, flick all, let that motherfucker dump, dump, dump
Homicide, I'm ready to ride for my brothers
Suicidal, I'll die for my brothers
When that motherfuckin' 4-5 bust
Flick all, flick all, let that motherfucker dump, dump, dump

[Verse]
Creeping out the cut with them outlaws
Masked up and ready to blow your mothafuckin balls off
I’ve been itching for that bloodshed
Keep on barkin' like a bitch and ima split open your forehead
All the pain that I feel inside
Got me ready and I'm really killa, finna end a nigga life
All I wanted was some love mane
Never had it and I seen the people with it made me wanna take it
I’ve been empty on the inside
And the thought that I could take another life made me feel alive
I’ll ride, I’ll die for my brotherhood
And every nigga that I’m with know that Xen would
So just know it ain’t a question if he test me
Ima teach that ignorant nigga a lesson
Oughta know not to fuck with my tribe
If Xen want him then it's dead, not alive

When that motherfuckin' 4-5 bust
Flick all, flick all, let that motherfucker dump, dump, dump3Embed
