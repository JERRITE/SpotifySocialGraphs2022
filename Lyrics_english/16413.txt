Is this love - 2003 remastered version LyricsI should have known better
Than to let you go alone
It's times like these
I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again

I find I spend my time
Waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe
My back's against the wall
I need you by my side
So tell me it's alright
? Cos I don't think
I can take anymore
Is this love that I'm feeling
Is this the love
That I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love
? Cos it really got a hold on me
A hold on me

I can't stop the feeling
I've been this way before
But with you I've found the key
To open any door
I can feel my love for you
Growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms

Is this love that I'm feeling
Is this the love
That I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love
? Cos it really got a hold on me
A hold on me

Is this love that I'm feeling
Is this the love
That I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This is the love
That I've been searching for
