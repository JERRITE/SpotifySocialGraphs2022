You imagined Lyrics ["You imagined"]

[Intro]
(Yeah-eh)

[Verse 1]
Looks at me as if I knew (as if I knew)
What is in my mind (-Ye, -te, -te)
I want to steal you today (Ho-O-and) as a criminal
Spend more time and I feel more (I'm sorry)
I will only tell you that if you give me the chance (chance)
I don't lie (I don't lie), I will grab you and do with you
[Chorus]
Things you never imagined
And touch you in places that you did not teach me-e
Although I know you thought about it (OH-OH)
And I don't know why you say nothing (OH-OH)
If when you played (-caste)
Long ago since your body spoke to me

[Verse 2]
That shows although you think it is not seen (that is not seen)
I saw how you put on when I touched you (-which)
I put on pa 'you and the others I left them
And if your friends ask for you, tell them that I steal you
You, hiding, oh-oh
And I your mind damaging, oh-oh
Addictive like what is running, oh-oh
And I know that 'pa' is the same as me I'm
But you are hiding it, oh-oh
And I your mind damaging-or
If you look at me 'and you know what I have in mind
Well, know that I want to do only

[Chorus]
Things you never imagined
And touch you in places that you did not teach me-e
Although I know you thought about it (OH-OH)
And I don't know why you say nothing (OH-OH)
If when you played (-caste)
Long ago since your body spoke to me
