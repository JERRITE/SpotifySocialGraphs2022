â€‹that one song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh really
Your parents are out of town?
Well i'll be at your house in a few
And i don't care if we just drive around
As long as i'm next to you
You're tellin me you know of a party
And that it's gonna be gnarly
But girl i'd rather watch netflix
Cause all i wanna do
Is be alone with you
Cause i think you're the bestest, yeah
[Hook]
I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't babe)

And I know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but I got a better plan;
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song

Sing along to that one song (oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
And it goes like:
She's in a Smiths tee underneath her flannel
She could drink whatever but she loves Jack Daniels
I wanna get out this party and go home and light some candles
These people are too much for me to handle, yeah
You might also likeYou're sorta hipster, I grew up on punk rock
And I know how to party when I be goin' I don't stop
But tonight, girl I don't want no one else
I want you all to myself
So if you with it let's get it
We could be gone in a minute
Then light it up and we split it, aye
This gon' be a night that you won't be forgettin'
If you get caught we'll tell your dad
You needed help with house sittin' aye

[Hook]
I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(i got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't babe)

And i know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but i got a better plan;
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song
Sing along to that one song (oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
Sing along like:
Everybody's got that one song (one song)
Let me sing it to you all night long (night long)
We be makin' love with the lights on (lights on)
It don't matter baby if it's right wrong (right wrong yeah)

So if you leavin' with me
Well then we rollin' in a minute
Baby we gon' see! yeah
Maybe we could kick it
To some dylan or some del rey
Order in some postmates
That's when she say:

[Hook/Outro]
I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(i got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't babe)

And i know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but i got a better plan;
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song4Embed
