Last Man on the Moon LyricsI just can't seem to concentrate today
Seems my mind is wandering away
And all these things
Swimming through my head
Fade away when I go back to bed

And I close my eyes
See how fast time flies
Cause sunrise comes too soon

And I'm never out of bed before noon
And waking up too late would be too soon
Oh yeah, and I could never be Neil Armstrong
I'd be the last man on the moon
I used to live in a world of black and white
Until my dreams turned day into night

And I'm never out of bed before noon
And waking up too late would be too soon
So I close my eyes
And wait for the surprise

In a place I know I belong
In my head I can do no wrong
And I could never be Neil Armstrong
I'd be the last man on the moon

Never out of bed before noon
(Sunrise comes too soon)
And waking up too late would be too soon
(I'm lost without my silver spoon)
And I'm never out of bed before noon
(I float away in my balloon)
And hide in the corners of my room
(As July overtakes June)

In a place I know I belong
(In a place I know I belong)
In my head I can do no wrong
(In my head I can do no wrong)
Well who ever heard of an astronaut with one arm?
I'd be the last man on the moonYou might also likeEmbed
