Make You Stay Lyrics[Verse 1: Ryan McCartan]
I'd sing acapella in the rain
Let the whole world think I've gone insane
Give you all my money and my name

[Refrain: Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron]
Nothing I wouldn't do, nothing I wouldn't do

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron]
When I'm crazy and I don't know why
Would you calm me down and read my mind?
Would you still send shivers up my spine?
[Refrain: Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron]
Nothin' I wouldn't do, nothin' I wouldn't do

[Chorus: Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron]
We could be, we could be anything tonight
Just tell me everything you like (like)
Can't you see
We could be something if we try?
Just tell me how to make you mine (mine)
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
Stay ay aya aya ay
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta to do to make you-
Stay aya aya ay aya

[Verse 2: Dove Cameron & Ryan McCartan, Both]
I would break the laws of gravity
Kill it for you in the first degree
Shut the world out when you need to breathe

[Refrain: Ryan McCartan, Dove Cameron]
Nothing I wouldn't do, nothing I wouldn't do
You might also like[Chorus: Ryan McCartan, Dove Cameron]
We could be, we could be anything tonight
Just tell me everything you like (like)
Can't you see
We could be something if we try?
Just tell me how to make you mine (mine)
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
Stay aya aya aya ay
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta to do to make you-
Stay ay aya ay ay

[Interlude: Dove Cameron]
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

[Bridge: Ryan McCartan, Both, Dove Cameron]
Cause I've never known love like this
Never known love like this
Yeah-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

[Chorus: Ryan McCartan & Dove Cameron]
We could be, we could be anything tonight
Just tell me everything you like (like)
Can't you see
We could be something if we try?
Just tell me how to make you mine (mine)
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
Stay aya aya aya ay
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta do to make you-
What have I gotta to do to make you-
