Lovely One (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Michael Jackson & (The Jacksons)]
Why don't you believe me
When I say that I love you
I'm crazy 'bout you
You wear the face that tells me
You think my lovin' ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire
I get higher every time I speak your name
All I do
(That's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Now the first time that I saw you
Walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson & (The Jacksons)]
Why don't you believe me
When I say that I am true
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you
I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about you
Living and hoping
But I'm coping with these things
You put me through
All I do
(That's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains

Girl, it's driving me insane

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
