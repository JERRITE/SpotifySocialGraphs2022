Do or that lyricson text from Jonna Fraser - "do or die" ft. Brotherly love

[Hook: Jonna Fraser]
I'm not looking for a problem, don't want to be annoying
What you think about is a thing of the past
Honey I can tell you you are safe with me
This is "Do or Die"
I'm not looking for a problem, don't want to be annoying
What you think about is a thing of the past
Honey I can tell you you are safe with me
This is "Do or Die"
[Fresh 1: Jonna Fraser]
Appearance of "you don't need a man"
If you walk by is despair at Man-Dem
When you go out you often pull that handbrake
That's attractive, I have one more comment
You don't have to do that way because I am also lit
I see that you are proud of it is high
I want to wash with you, I want to dance with you
You have to tell me if there is hope

[Fresh 2: EMMS]
I'm not looking for problems honey
I'm not difficult as my training suit
Is in the car with you, not Senegal
Shards bring happiness, I just break some glass
I don't break your heart
Because Shawty, you are my beyonc√©
Your thoughts archive, want you to give me a chance
Here the coast is safe
Put your lips on mine and your coast safely
Mouth on mouth like those gossip in the neighborhood

[Hook: Jonna Fraser]
I'm not looking for a problem, don't want to be annoying
What you think about is a thing of the past
Honey I can tell you you are safe with me
This is "Do or Die"
I'm not looking for a problem, don't want to be annoying
What you think about is a thing of the past
Honey I can tell you you are safe with me
This is "Do or Die"

[?] I am off the street
Baby get to know me because then you know what you are talking
Don't go along what the rest says
You judge me what I dress
And if it seems that I look angry I have no lenses
So if I don't greet first, baby greets me
Because then I really haven't seen you
Set your honor aside if you have Louis Bag
Please Baby Do not go crazy Paw Paw

[Fresh 4: Sjaff]
How do you want to discharge me?
It's those steps we chose
Started at the bottom and now we climb up
Problems in the past but I want to Closen now
Girl believe me
Maybe I am unfaithful but remember that sometimes I wish you are building a little on me in negative days
I on you, you on me. Both at all times it doesn't matter
Problems honey, I talk it out (Sjaff!)

[Fresh 5: Mella]
We are drinking the two of us at a party
Then I want to stitch to an otro, yes you know
Yes I throw those branches when I drink and I eat you
1, 2, 3, 4 Tequilas, Drink a little
Do or that, baby stay with me
But don't think about stupid things because that's a thing of the past
And I'm not going to lie for you I am the dirty but look
I am not with those things from your girlfriends or Shy

[Bridge: EMMS]
Our characters can collide without damage because kiss is allowed. Come closer, want to bite your lips
Mouth on mouth, not a commercial
Sorry that I stood with a few ladies last night
Oho yeah, oh yeah
