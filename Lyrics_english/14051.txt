Donâ€™t Let It Get You Down LyricsThe storm it came from cross the seven seas
Hold your course, here comes the cavalry

Don't let it get you, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you, don't let it get you down

You dreamed a dream and they said, "Pay no mind."
Oh, but momma said, "Girl, faith ain't for the blind."

So don't let it get you, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you, don't let it get you down
Oh, this could be the part of you that you ain't never seen before
Oh, this could be the part, the part of you, you wanna be

December came, but spring was following
I prayed for one and once he came for me

So don't let it get you, don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you, don't let it get you downYou might also likeEmbed
