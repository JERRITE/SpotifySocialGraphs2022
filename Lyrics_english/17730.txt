Next Up - S3-E47, Pt.1 Lyrics[Intro]
Idi Akz
Idi Akz, you're the hardest, bro, I got love for my dargy though
(HARGO Production)
They wanna know if I sing like Not3s
I was never rated by the OGs
Might just ghost and disappear (Look, Idi Akz, like)
Look

[Verse 1]
I was never rated by the OGs, minor man 'cause I couldn't care (I don't)
The man there just fake, lil' gems and when there's problems they'll disappear like, what? (They're gems)
Nobody's real round here, nobody really spits 'round here (They don't)
I ain't really into the Snapchat drama, most times, I ghost then disappear (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Lol, I'm glad that I'm leavin' the ends, I could never call them friends, their snaky (Uh)
Them man there got Shaw like Fernandes (Uh), but it's always the cats, go mainstream
Paige like Cakey, hate or rate me
It's the pain in the bars that made me (They did)
Sing song, there was pressure on me (Uh), you could call me little baby
We-we-we got ships, Spanish Armada (We do)
I am the most hated karla
Been rappin' in school from young, think that my name, Josh Carter (Hah)
Back then it was bummy, David (What?), so I'm tryna make a hunna bands
Sorry darlin', I will never land, they go to Holland, but they never land (Never do)
Back then it was young like Ashley (Uh?), them days bro-bro didn't back me (They didn't)
Them man are too fake it's mad, to someone's on them, I'ma bun him gladly (Bun him)
Sick with the bars and flows don't mad me
Only fifteen, paigons can't stand me (Fifteen)
Ayy, I'm only fifteen paigons, can't match me
See I'm slept on, but I'm cold akh and my heart's so black like Kodak (Black)
This one wanna know my zodiac (Uh), ain't Thursday, bust one, throw back
And I'll do that one for my brother
When a rapper don't even stutter
Sorry darlin don't know bout P's and she's just really long like Pogba
[Chorus]
Nobody's real 'round here, nobody really spits 'round here (They're not)
I ain't really into the Snapchat drama, most times, I ghost then disappear (I'll ghost)
Lol, I'm glad that I'm leavin' the ends, I could never call them friends their snaky (They're snakes)
Them man there got Shaw like Fernandes, but it's always the cats go mainstream
Nobody's real 'round here, nobody really spits 'round here (They don't)
I ain't really into the Snapchat drama, most times, I ghost then disappear (I'll ghost)
Lol, I'm glad that I'm leavin' the ends, I could never call them friends their snaky (They're snakes)
Them man there got Shaw like Fernandes, but it's always the cats go mainstream

[Outro]
I'm the hardest kid, no question
And she's got me, did I mention
I'ma DE boy, gotta rep my city, whoosh
Yeah, I think that was betterYou might also likeEmbed
