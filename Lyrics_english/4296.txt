[Verse 1: Don Omar]
Friend, let's talk, let's talk
I have seen again, that woman who hurt you
That hurt you, for whom you suffered your heart
And he asked me, how are you doing
In your new life
That if you are happy, and I replied, friend
[Chorus: Don Omar]
That you are very good, very good, very good
Since he left, he left, he left
That love left, goodbye
That now you live without pain
That you still live without faith, without faith, since he left, he left
And although I see you laugh, live
I know you really want to die

[Post-car]
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Although I really know what you want to die
Friend, I told him

[Verse 2]
Precisely now I was thinking about her
I would like to see her head on, and tell her what she feels
That although with my heart I do not keep resentment
That now I have a new love, which has relieved that pain
That although with my heart he played, I don't keep resentment
That now I have a new love, which has relieved that pain
And I'm very good, very good
Since he left, he left, and only his goodbye was, goodbye
I already forgot my mind

That you are very good, very good, very good
Since he left, he left, he left
That love left, goodbye
That now you live without pain
That you still live without faith, without faith, since he left, he left
And although I see you laugh, live
I know you really want to die

[Post-car]
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Although I really know what you want to die
Friend, I told him

[Verse 3]
It's not to harm your mind, friend, if you saw her
For me I find it more beautiful
And his sorceress eyes, which captivate anyone
It's not to harm your mind, friend, if you saw her
For me I find it more beautiful
And his sorceress eyes, which captivate anyone
Now is your decision, you know her better than me
You just know 'what happened among you
It's from you, give your forgiveness
If it's for my turn, today say goodbye
Now is your decision, you know her better than me
You only know what happened among you
It's from you, give your forgiveness
If it's for my turn, today say goodbye
[Chorus: Don Omar]
That you are very good, very good, very good
Since he left, he left, he left
That love left, goodbye
That now you live without pain
That you still live without faith, without faith, since he left, he left
And although I see you laugh, live
I know you really want to die

[Post-car]
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Friend, I told him
Although I really know what you want to die
Friend, I told him
