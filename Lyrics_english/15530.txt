Lyricsenferma love sick 

 Neither asleep nor awake 
 He goes from my head 
 I think of him 
 Why it will be 

 On the street and at school 
 Worse than a toothache 
 Always is 
 It doesn't leave me alone 
 Even among the folds 
 Of the pillow every night 
 He comes to look 

 **Chorus** 
 This obsession 
 I do not understand 
 It makes me feel bad 
 I'm simply sick with love 
 This obsession 
 That takes my sleep 
 It is the signal 
 That I am already sick of love 

 With the fingertips 
 I put your name in the wind 
 And then 
 I feel good 

 No one knows my secret 
 Everything is inside 
 Although 
 That is not 

 How they eat 
 The senses to the boys 
 I do not know what to do 
 You Might Also Like ** Choir ** 
 This obsession 
 I do not understand 
 It makes me feel bad 
 I'm simply sick with love 
 This obsession 
 That takes my sleep 
 It is the signal 
 That I am already sick with love (x4) embed
