[Verse 1]
My soul loves Jehovah, to'a the honor belongs to Jesus
And the glory is from the spirit, which in the dark gives lu ’
It is eternal power, and without government arreguindarte
You called Santa Cos, you bastard, and it wasn't 'in winter (Yeah)
Get out with the two, that there is fire for me that cuque me (prrau)
It is the main one, the flow crea'o dismantling ships
The perfect delivеry (hahaha), my fault 'e' 0%
And the name that torments you since you threw "inside" (rrr)
Dare-you-you, say (ha)
Not because I seam
That I uninstall them and for you there is no more bad
That a cardboard trunk, bastard, is lowering your stick
Visitor, look for the guitar ’and the conga’ (hahaha)
The Amarra 'to the bonga ’and hold on' I give you '
That after this way, the tribe 'of the Kawasaki
It is not 'at the Amazon', this area is the Porto Rocky (Wuff)
I'm heating, looking for the medal
That when I he heat I feel like Xander Zayas (hahaha)
The impenetrable defense, the untouchable
My bar 'are double -edged, so think about' that I speak '(Wuh!)
That I have to's your data 'in the notebook
He cannot 'criticize the candidate without living under the government (Ajá)
He cannot 'criticize that there is no job if he does not live' in 100x35

[Verse 2]
He throws Balvin, does not throw 'the servant (aha)
And throwing Coscu is like going to the desert and giving you the crow '
"Threw Coscu, who does not know about Pablo Coelho" (Grr, Chu)
But I made it right now to break the ice
Resident of the 'ESDE THE 36 (WOH)
But it goes down for the strike 'e chop' in Hato Rey
Pa 'throw photo' and look rebel on the spokesman
And how much 'chop' that the guy has full '?, Tell me: zero (zero!)
He was not in the hurricane (Nah), nor in the earthquake '
He went down in a macan (aha) as always for the photo
Pa 'record criticizing and pointing broken tube (hahahaha)
Is it so shit? Well, don't live 'with us (Yeah)
You have to make an enclosure and release it on the island 'e mona
Leave it twenty day 'by force' e malta y dona '(oky)
Let's see if we are unlocked by hearing the tides
Gentlemen, the only idealist who has no idea '(Wuf!)
White Lion, White Lion, Tego doesn't give it to you (Wuh!)
White Lion, White Lion, and speaking the truth '
The hypocrisy of that 'time' in which it was' up to date
You won twenty grammys, you never mentioned Elijah (bastard)
They have called me 'pendejo', call to 'those who have'
That I do not believe in revenge, my Jehovah is the one who comes (Ajá)
That I do not believe in revenge or guideline 'in the Pharisee' (BRR)
I am looking for the Bible, Atheist, and look in Matthew (Woh!; Yeah)

Resi, I pray for you, but you don't pray '
And I know that you are a hustle with beer
In the first pull, 'they said: "Made in Iraq" (class' and shit)
That is' broth 'and camel, they know Keystone expirá' (Yeah)
And the tyrannia is not law, I amounted to you in a seventeenth '
I kill you without delay, not to mention Rubén Blade '
May Tito Roja rest in peace ', Bosi, Atye me, Güey
That Wimbledon is not the same if the final e 'in Clay
And I don't know if it is alcohol or so much Spanish class
But your theme 'enzyme, bastard, you are in Cruise Control (enzyme)
That if the accent, that if the esdrújula, today empjula
And you who do not believe in Christ, hold on a compass
That 'you can lose the north and you know it' (and you know it ')
I greet my veneco 'that they saw you sucking it to Hugo Cháve' (Yeah)
Where poverty reigns there can be no dictatorship
Life is hard without machetes at the waist (GRR)
You do not 'tito kayak,' tas taking a star '(prr-prr)
And I later ended up, put the gap and now
Close the beak, which is already fed up in Puerto Rico
Of so much philosophy and the philosopher was Vico
The intelligent style you use '(oh, shit)
With that shit and you no coatuza '
Ver looks for Antillean (Ajá), call
It is resident (hehe), the sausage sandwich with legend (hahahaha)

Of the shirts 'and the tail' cannot 'do na', ha, pff!
