Letania Lyricscaricia of my sadness 
 Balm of my pain 
 Source of wisdom 
 Lucero of my morning 
 Health of my illness 
 Spring of my joy 
 Comfort of my mistakes 
 Cup of my reality 
 Tower of my courage 
 Pulse from my heart 
 Shout of my rebellion 
 Wind of my fantasy 
 Anger 
 Angel of my loneliness 
 My mother
