Lyrics energy [Verse 1]
Once upon a time the sun and the moon
Reflecting in the sky and in the sea
The old land entered a cold
The energy missed, the air turned off

[Pre-chorus]
The time has come for the car zunir
The time has come for Jeep Lunar
Now I want to have fun
Now I want to shuffle
[Chorus]
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy

[VERSE 2]
Once upon a time the sun and the moon
Reflecting in the sky and in the sea
The old land entered a cold
The energy missed, the air turned off

[Pre-chorus]
The time has come for the car zunir
The time has come for Jeep Lunar
Now I want to have fun
Now I want to shuffle

[Chorus]
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy
Of my energy, give my energy

The time has come for the car zunir
The time has come for Jeep Lunar
Now I want to have fun
Now I want to shuffle

[Chorus]
Once upon a time the sun and the moon
Reflecting in the sky and in the sea
The old land entered a cold
The energy missed, the air turned off
The time has come for the car zunir
The time has come for Jeep Lunar
Now I want to have fun
Now I want to shuffle
