Happiness lyrics [verse 1] 
 Winter is over 
 I decided to visit you 
 On the way to your house 
 For the first time 
 I feel fear 
 And I covered my eyes in the sword of souls 
 I have running gan 
 I will bark against nothing 
 I thought I didn't survive 
 But I arrived 
 [Chorus 1] 
 Cheers 
 On the back street 
 I will be a little more 
 Cheers 
 Hell is good 

 [Verse 2] 
 And your sky a purple blood 
 Hot, I feel your grass 
 WhitMenics Visagens 
 I'm not afraid 

 [Chorus 2] 
 Cheers 
 On the back street 
 I will be a little more 
 Cheers 
 From behind 
 Love is simpler 

 [Verse 3] 
 It was joy that was in me 
 I remember 
 Of us both 
 You might also like [chorus 3] 
 Cheers 
 On the back street 
 Let's get a little more 
 Cheers 
 From behind 
 Love is simpler than loving 
 Love is simpler than loving 
 Love is simpler than yellow
