Covering My Ears Lyrics[Verse 1: wewantwraiths]
Let me say some, no one getting paid
Before I do my aim on you
I had a dream that I got a machine gun
Suttin' to lean on
These monkey's gon' wait upon you

[Verse 2: M24]
I feel more than safe when Sindy's 'round
Cah I know she ain't gon let me down (Uh)
I admit that's bae (Yes)
All she does is make me proud (Uh-uh)
Sweet one, this one fits in her pouch
Don't wine her up, she's wild, loud
I don't think you wanna hear her speak
You know it's gonna shake the crowd
[Chorus: wewantwraiths]
I'm covering my ears like a kid
This the city full of guns and it goes ra-ta-ta-ta
We turnin' up, can't hеar you when you speak
'Cause my hеarts still broken from this path I've chosen

[Post-Chorus: wewantwraiths & Naughty Boy]
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na

[Verse 3: M24]
Turn up, everybody turn up
All the drillers in the party turn up (Uh-uh)
We got Sindy with us, so we're safe
I'ma let my hair down today and turn up
We got all type of girls in the rave
We don't discriminate, Hot Nigga like Shmurda (All of them)
So much loud in the room, so much ballons
I wish you was here, free Burna
Watch me cover my ears like a kid
I ain't really tryna hear Sindy scream
That's mad how the fans go wild when they see me
I'm just a young nigga living my dream
I don't pop no pills, but I pop champagne
That smartwhip shit ain't for me
I swear I'm really tryna get lit, lit
Baby girl, come party with me and my team
You might also like[Chorus: wewantwraiths]
I'm covering my ears like a kid
This the city full of guns and it goes ra-ta-ta-ta
We turnin' up, can't hear you when you speak
'Cause my hearts still broken from this path I've chosen

[Post-Chorus: wewantwraiths & Naughty Boy]
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na
It goes
La la, la la la la la na na na na na

[Verse 4: wewantwraiths]
I pour up some lean, I sit
Somali madeen, she lit
Keep her with me every each day
Gotta keep safe, can’t afford to slip
I’m sick of these niggas, get rid
I’m sick of these niggas, get rid of these niggas
It’s hard to be this lit, whenever she rolls, we’re lit
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 5: M24]
Whenever she rolls, we’re lit
Look at my wrist, it’s about that time
I told shawty that we don’t dance
She’s still tryna give me a whine
Blue phone, phone sex
Now I’m getting lit with the guys
Baby, show me, I swear I got caught by surprise (Uh-uh)Embed
