Womp Womp Lyrics[Intro]
(Cássio)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Hey, womp-womp, womp-womp
She give me what I wanna
Ball so hard, need a warmup
I bagged her at the Walmart (Yeah)
Big timer, stunner (Woo)
I'm out here on the come up
I beat the pussy, drummer
I roll up, no more drama (Yeah)
Womp-womp, womp-womp
She give me what I wanna
Ball so hard, need a warmup
I bagged her at the Walmart (Yeah)
Big timer, stunner (Woo)
I'm out here on the come up (Woo)
I beat the pussy, drummer
I roll up, no more drama (Woo)
[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Ayy, super stunt dummy should be in the Special Olympics (Well)
Pockets so fat that I need Bally Total Fitness (Well)
Feet so fat, I hit the pedal, blew the engine
V12, duckin' 12 like license is suspended (Hey)
She's a slobber, all on my knob, corn the cobber
Ayy, sweet thing and that pussy taste like peach cobbler
I'ma never ever take her to meet mama
Just got a lineup and just added two more to my lineup (Hey)
Big money, why you always standin' on your wallet?
Profit, I just made another one, I'm Khaled
Stop it, they asked me what I do with my stacks
Just bought a new wall for plaques and a new broad for some smacks

[Chorus: Jeremih & Valee]
Hey, womp-womp, womp-womp
She give me what I wanna
Ball so hard, need a warmup
I bagged her at the Walmart (Yeah)
Big timer, stunner (Woo)
I'm out here on the come up
I beat the pussy, drummer
I roll up, no more drama (Yeah)
Womp-womp, womp-womp
She give me what I wanna
Ball so hard, need a warmup
I bagged her at the Walmart (Yeah)
Big timer, stunner (Woo)
I'm out here on the come up (Come up)
I beat the pussy, drummer
I roll up, no more drama (Drama)

Asked my mama for bread (Ma)
She told me, "Uh-uh" (No)
That's the day I wanted (Wanted)
To get my bread up, uh-huh (Yep)
T-shirt VLONE (VLONE)
Leave the coupe runnin', won't be long (Be long)
Chinese food, wonton (Wonton)
I might as well try that one time
I pour Wock' in the Fanta (Fanta)
My new bop speakin' Spanish (Spanish)
Fuck her twice, vanish (Vanish)
My VVSs shinin' (Shinin')
Bought the bitch some Chanel
And told her it's a handout (Handout)
Old school look undone (Undone)
But you still wanna buy one (Buy one)
Bitch look like Wonder Woman (Woman)
High fashion don't cost nothin' (Nope)
Bought that bitch some acid (Yep)
Yeah, I brought back the fun, fun (Yep)
Even though her weave undone (Nope)
I fucked her twice, come, come (Yep)
I spent seven hundred (What?)
Then met the bitch in London (London)
I just bought some Balmains (Uh-huh)
And since day one they looked undone (Undone)
Like Chip Foose, my whip custom (Custom)
A tooth chipped, think I lost one (Uh)
I spent seven hundred (Hundred)
Fucked that overseas stunner (Stunner)
If she a slut, I'll find out
I'll meet that bitch mañana
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Hey, womp-womp, womp-womp

I roll up, no more drama (Yeah)
Womp-womp, womp-womp
She give me what I wanna
Ball so hard, need a warmup
I bagged her at the Walmart (Yeah)
Big timer, stunner
I'm out here on the come up (The come up)
I beat the pussy, drummer
I roll up, no more drama

[Verse 3: Jeremih & Valee]
Hey, try not to assume, uh
I tell her to assume, uh (Huh)
I pull up to the spot, they pull the carpet out like Luna
Bitch had on some Pumas
Told her ass to boot up
Put her on my homie
She said she down for crew love (Hm)
Ridin' with no cosign
I got that bread, croissant (The croissant)
Bitch trippin', I think that shit ludicrous, Shawnna (Shawnna)
I'm talkin' shit kinda
My left wrist tryin' to blind ya
I'm lookin' at designer
But not who made Panda
Bottle girls bringin' all the sparklers in (Sparklers in)
Sirens on, feel like the ice cream man
They try to keep me out but I just Heisman in (Heisman in)
She brought her friend, they wanna eat, told 'em we dinin' in (Huh)
Bitch lazy, don't do much
I fuck her on the futon
I'm in some high fashion
Your bitch is dry, cactus
I been up three days, need mattress
I'm feelin' beat up, Cassius (Cassius)
These hoes fake, actress
My blunt stuffed, sinus
