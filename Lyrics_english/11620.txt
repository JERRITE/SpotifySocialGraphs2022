Kerina LyricsSweetest Kerina, give me a sign
Still haven't seen you
But I'm calling you all the time
Calling you all the time
Caught in the turning
Losing the line
But I've learned to believe you
When you say it'll be just fine
You say it'll be just fine
Let me know reasons why we change
Why our bodies are more than just breath and veins
Yeah, I wonder what remains
Past the forests and borders and pocket change
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, wind doesn't blow, baby
Just 'cause I want it to
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you don't want me, honey
Just 'cause I wanted you
Caught in the turning
Losing my mind
Lose what I'm learning
When I'm calling you all the time
But you say it'll be just fine

Let me know reasons why we change
Why our bodies are more than just breath and veins
Yeah, I wonder what remains
Past the forests and borders and pocket change

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, wind doesn't blow, baby
Just 'cause I want it to
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, you don't want me, honey
Just 'cause I wanted youYou might also likeEmbed
