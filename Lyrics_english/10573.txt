1501 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy, you want that ooh-na-na
Ring-ring when you come through
No need for no suit, no tie
Boy, come show me what you talked 'bout in them texts you send me, baby
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' want it again, it won't be a fade
It's that work I put in
You gon' wanna race, right back to the spot
Like there's something you forgot oh, yeah
No need for us to wait, wait, wait, wait
No need for us to wait, wait, wait, wait
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus]
I can't wait to get you in this room (Yeah, yeah)
You ain't ever wanna leave my room
Boy, you don't know what you 'bout to get into
When I get through with you, when I get through with you

[Verse 2]
That first round got you super hot
Too much pressure, you tryin' hard not to shoot your shot (Shot)
Boy, get yourself together, you gon' lay up with me 'til the mornin'
Mornin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' want it again, it won't be a fade
It's that work I put in
You gon' wanna race, right back to the spot
Like there's something you forgot oh, yeah (Yeah)
No need for us to wait (Wait), wait, wait, wait (Wait)
No need for us to wait (Wait), wait, wait, wait (Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I can't wait to get you in this room (Yeah, yeah)
You ain't ever wanna leave my room
Boy, you don't know what you 'bout to get into
When I get through with you, when I get through with you (Oh)

You'll be right back, right back
You ain't ever wanna leave my room (Woah, oh)

[Chorus]
I can't wait to get you in this room (In my room, yeah, yeah)
You ain't ever wanna leave my room (You ain't ever wanna leave my room)
Boy, you don't know what you 'bout to get into (Get into)
When I get through with you (Yeah, yeah, woah)
