The Struggle Lyrics[Chorus]
Uh
Everybody has a struggle
Questions everywhere, yo, this life is a puzzle (A puzzle)
Everybody has their own story (Own story)
Everybody has a page when its fuckin' pouring (Fuckin' pouring)
Everybody feels pain (Feels pain)
Everybody feels what's so hard to explain (Explain)
Yeah
But this is life, homie
This is life, this is life, this is life, homie
[Verse 1]
Yo
Imagine life without a stuggle, every day is sunny
Where happiness is really free, ain't no need for money
Where happiness only shines in the shadow
Where those who have their eyes closed overcome the battles (Battles)
Sometimes I wonder how this life would be
For one day my dad was out of the penitentiary
I'd hold him tight, I'd never let him go
Without him I ain't shit he's my heart, mind, and soul (Soul)
I miss my mother so damn much
I'm trying to cover up these tears that she can't touch
She changed, and it kills me inside
I'd do anything to have her back in my life (My life, my life)
I pray to God every single day
He takes away from this pain which has overcame
Who I am, and who I'm trying to be
A man with a message, a man with a dream (With a dream)
If this is life, what the fuck is love?
If love is kind, who gon' fuck it up?
'Cause everybody knows nothing lasts forever
When everything is good, that's the moment that you treasure (You treasure)

[Chorus]
Uh
Everybody has a struggle
Questions everywhere, yo, this life is a puzzle (A puzzle)
Everybody has their own story (Own story)
Everybody has a page when its fuckin' pouring (Fuckin' pouring)
Everybody feels pain (Feels pain)
Everybody feels what's so hard to explain (Explain)
Yeah
But this is life, homie
This is life, this is life, this is life, homie
Uh
Everybody has a struggle
Questions everywhere, yo, this life is a puzzle (A puzzle)
Everybody has their own story (Own story)
Everybody has a page when its fuckin' pouring (Fuckin' pouring)
Everybody feels pain (Feels pain)
Everybody feels what's so hard to explain (Explain)
Yeah
But this is life, homie
This is life, this is life, this is life, homie

Uh
These past months been the hardest that I'm going through (Going through)
Joel changed, yo, fuck it, man, I know it's true
What you expect, man, my uncle just killed himself
I wish he took that will to just rebuild himself
If I could, I'd turn back the hands of time
I'd try to show him that there is light if you let it shine
But I guess not, cause now he's gone
So I let him live through the soul of my song (My song)
Uh
I know the struggle will be worth it all (Worth it all)
I know the struggle will be worth the fall (Worth the fall)
See every day's another lesson
And every sunrise is a life that we're blessed with (Blessed with)
I tell my family every single day
I'm grateful for all the love that they gave to me (Gave to me)
They hold it down when I'm on the ground
Tell me they love me, and, nigga, that's the sweetest (Sweetest sound)
I promise, dad, I won't give up (Won't give up)
Raise my head and let my chest pick up (Chest pick up)
Never back down, I put my fist up
Cause life's a battle, yo, it's just what it consist of (Conisist of)
This is me 'til the day I die ('Til the day I die)
This is me 'til the day I fly ('Til the day I fly)
In the sky, looking down at what life was (What life was)
You can be yourself, just put yourself in God's trust (God's trust)

[Chorus]
Uh
Everybody has a struggle
Questions everywhere, yo, this life is a puzzle (A puzzle)
Everybody has their own story (Own story)
Everybody has a page when its fuckin' pouring (Fuckin' pouring)
Everybody feels pain (Feels pain)
Everybody feels what's so hard to explain (Explain)
Yeah
But this is life, homie
This is life, this is life, this is life, homie33Embed
