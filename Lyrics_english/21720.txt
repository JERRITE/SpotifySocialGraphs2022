Acid Eyes Lyrics[Chorus]
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you, when I looked
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you, and I looked
Into your acid eyes

[Verse 1]
You did the damage when you walked in the room
You started whistling my favourite tune
You did the damage, yeah, it's done from the start
It's like you swallowed my heart
It's like you swallowed my heart
[Chorus]
Oh, I
I never told you I lovеd you (Told you, I)
I never told you I loved you, and I lookеd
Into your acid eyes (Eyes)
Into your acid eyes (Eyes)
I never told you I loved you (Told you, I)
I never told you I loved you, and I looked
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes

[Verse 2]
And we were gone
Up into outer space, my mind was on
I played guitar while you painted the romance
You moved so fast
We'd never last
And now you're gone
Away to Mexico, my mind is on
She's in my car while you're asking him to dance
I should have asked
I never asked

[Chorus]
So baby, now
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you and I looked
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you and I looked
Into your acid eyes

Those shadows met me shaking in the hollow hour as my memories were melting in the sun
Yeah, the memories are melting on the broken flowers and the cicadas sang the chorus
Like they were singing for us
Those shadows met me shaking in the hollow hour as my memories were melting in the sun
Yeah, the memories are melting on the broken flowers and the cicadas sang the chorus
They sang on, and on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Ooh
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you and I looked
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
I never told you I loved you
I never told you I loved you and I looked
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyes
Into your acid eyesEmbed
