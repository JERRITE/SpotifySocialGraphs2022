Iâ€™m Alive Lyrics[GABE]
I am what you want me to be
And I'm your worst fear
You'll find it in me
Come closer
Come closer

I am more than memory
I am what might be
I am mystery
You know me
So show me
When I appear
It's not so clear
If I'm a simple spirit
Or I'm flesh and blood

But I'm alive, I'm alive, I am so alive
And I feed on the fear that's behind your eyes
And I need you to need me, it's no surprise

I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

I am flame and I am fire
I am destruction, decay, and desire
I'll hurt you
I'll heal you
I'm your wish, your dream come true
And I am your darkest nightmare too
I've shown you
I own you
And though you made me
You can't change me
I'm the perfect stranger
Who knows you too well
You might also likeBut I'm alive, I'm alive, I am so alive
And I'll tell you the truth if you let me try
You're alive, I'm alive, and I'll show you why

I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

I'm right behind you
You say forget, but I'll remind you
You can try to hide but you know that I will find you
Cause if you won't grieve me
You won't leave me behind

Oh-ho, oh
Whoa
Whoa

No, no, no
I'm alive, I'm alive, I am so alive
If you climb on my back, then we both can fly
If you try to deny me, I'll never die

I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive
Yeah, yeah
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive2Embed
