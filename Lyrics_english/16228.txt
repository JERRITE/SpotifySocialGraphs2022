​you don’t deserve these tears Lyrics[Verse 1]
Think I really need a therapist
'Cause you really fucked me up
I think it's kinda funny that your mom and dad are texting me "congrats" on all my songs
I think I should be over this
'Cause it's been too fucking long
I should be forgetting you, hating you, moving on
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't deserve it
The way that I'm hurting
Oh, how did I end up here?
'Cause you're out there laughing
While I'm stuck here crying in the mirror
Screaming, "You don't deserve these tears"
[Verse 2]
Maybe I should text you drunk
Try to run into your friends
See you at a party, say you'rе sorry
That you miss me and you wish we didn't end
Oh, damn it, what thе fuck?
I'm getting all up in my head
I know that you were shitty, didn't treat me right
So why am I still missing you again?

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't deserve it
The way that I'm hurting
Oh, how did I end up here?
'Cause you're out there laughing
While I'm stuck here crying in the mirror
Screaming, "You don't deserve these tears"

[Outro]
So why am I crying?
Why am I crying?
Tell me, why am I crying?
Why am I crying?You might also likeEmbed
