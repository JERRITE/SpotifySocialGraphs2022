Half orange Lyricstoqu√© the moon thanks to you
I'm tarumba clear that yes
I don't know how it was
However you conquered you
Maybe my red mouth carnation
As to honey ants
It was the one who brought you here
Clean more than April water without asking
What everyone asked for and
Stepping strong
CHORUS:
You my complement
My half orange
I love you without crossing word
If this is not a dream
You are my other half oh, oh, oh ...

I danced with all my soul, I danced
I made you dance too
I floated, I know what I floated
As in water floats the fish
Without letting you separate more
All night

CHORUS:
You my complement
My half orange
I love you without crossing word
If this is not a dream
You are my other half oh, oh, oh ...
