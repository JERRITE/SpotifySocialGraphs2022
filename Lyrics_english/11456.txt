Live Till You Die Lyrics[Intro]
I have to say the things I feel, oh
I have to feel the things I say

[Chorus]
You must live till you die
You must fight to survive
You must live till you die
You must feel to be alive
You must live till you die
[Verse 1]
See the sun rising in the east, welcome warm days
Feel my heart flying every time we're alone, babe
Everything around me has been changing so
I can't let go, oh no no

[Chorus]
You must live till you die
You must fight to survive
You must live till you die
You must feel to be alive
You must live till you die

[Verse 2]
Feel the earth trembling, have you heard distant thunder?
Everything's moving, what's this feeling I'm under?
Everything around me has been changing so
I can't let go, oh no no

[Chorus]
You must live till you die
You must fight to survive
You must live till you die
You must feel to be alive
You must live till you die
You must live till you die
You might also like[Bridge]
I have to spin the spinning wheel
Oh, I have to kneel that way
I have to say the things I feel
Oh, I have to feel the things I say

[Chorus]
You must live till you die
You must fight to survive
You must live till you die
You must feel to be alive
You must live till you dieEmbed
