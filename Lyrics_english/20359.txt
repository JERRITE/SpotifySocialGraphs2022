Wuow Lyrics [lyrics of "Wuow"]

[Verse 1]
Why tell me that I don't kill
A flow of these neither do you have in the bush
Fuck your idol, I didn't make the pact
Magazine is what I have in my mouth
Each word that comes out is a bullet
I kill Beat at the shot and I wash Blood
Then I put a lixivia in the smear and scream "wuow"
[Chorus]
Shout "wuow", scream "wuow"
Bro, I scream "wuow"
Shout "wuow", scream "wuow"
When she spins, Woah
Gira Woah, Gira Woah
Looks like the wind, Blowin 'and Blowin' and Blowin '

[Verse 2]
I pull gun, pita bro
P'a touch the beat the pipe
Don't give your nose, toucan
You don't even play, you just have seen the field (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
I live in the race, Gump
GUITA ESTICA TYPE GUM
Like Pika, firm, gang
ODB Type, Wu-Tang Type
(Aye -yah) bro, I'm a human myth
There is no one who mimics a bro, clean beats like a cloth
(Yeah) Neither do you come to ask you to get you up
So much stone to go breaking
If she swallows, she gets drunk
(Ah-han) I must have something disturbing
I was just an urban kid
All that remains is to walk with a turban (kid)
I'm pausing with another pack (gross)
Always c'a sword like Trunks (from the future)
There is no prison even that the tranques (interest)
Is that this mind even fries the skull (I float)
And when I reach the clouds shout "wuow"
You might also like [chorus]
Shout "wuow", scream "wuow"
I can't believe it, wuow
Shout "wuow", scream "wuow"
'I'm in the highest, far
Still far away, still far
Even gives vertigo, woah

[Bridge]
(Was this the party?) When 'it's up, sick
(I'm in a hurry, quickly) I have almost life at stake
(Bro, the rest doesn't matter) I only have to enjoy the show

[Verse 3]
Bro, I'm foot on the deck, there is bué in this boat (oh)
She has to be a model with this wasp waist (ah-aah)
It's very bad, she just wants to suck (aah)
It gets crazy with an ocean between the legs (oh, oh)
E—, I go deep as submarine (Deep)
She is a summary fruit (mhm-nham)
Her pussy meets Marinho (I introduced myself)
And when we connect inside, wuow
It's the wuow, wait a - wuow
Give me this pussy wall, this is wuow
This is uh-oh-oh
This pussy is a problem, wow (but I'm goblin)
I can't imagine, Raw (Gaw-Gaw Gawdamn)
[Other]
Eat, beautiful, eat, beautiful, eat
You can eat everything
Give me, beautiful, give me, beautiful, give me
Then I return, "Take it, you take it, you take it"
Your booty praises with palms, with palms, with palms
We should teach theSembed
