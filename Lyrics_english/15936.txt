Living in Your World Lyrics [Randy:]
I get up with longing
A text message is not missing
For you to know that I'm fine
And if I get out and call me
I always answer you ...
I don't want you to expect my lady ...
[Chorus:]
Living in your world
You are too beautiful
For you I arrive at the women's stars
Living in your world
If I'm living in a dream
I do not want to wake up
[Jowell:]
Ho ho
Your love is essential
Ho ho
For me something special
I have
That I die for you
Ho ho
Although sometimes you treat me bad
I have
[Randy:]
You don't look at any (HE HE)
I don't want any anymore (I hehe)
Ma I want to see you (I have)
As you are only one ...
[Jowell:]
Even if I get on a plane
You know what you call me
Yes, you don't call me, I call you (Yoo ...)
If I don't look for you so that the relationship does not die
In your world I am asking
Just ask for it and I'm going
(Living in your world)
Just ask me that I give it to you today
Fall in love with your thwart skin
You are my sweet Caribbean
Of my heart the owner
Yes Mama Yes Mama ... [x2]
[Randy:]
I get up with longing
A text message is not missing
For you to know that I'm fine
And if I get out and call me
I always answer you ...
[Chorus:]
Living in your world
You are too beautiful
For you I arrive at the women's stars
Living in your world
If I'm living in a dream
I do not want to wake up
In a world of joys
World of love
All stars tell me about you ...
I keep looking at you all day
Not anymore...
There will be no one to separate me from you ...
And nooo ... I want ...
Wake up without you ...
Not anymore
One to the back baby
Living in your world
Uoooh living in your world
Yeah Woou Wouu Wouu ...
[Jowell:]
When I'm far from you
I need my
And I can't pretend it no
You live inside my yeah
But when I'm close to you
Ma! is that you make me happy
You are the one that makes me smile
I am crazy about you I feel
So so...
Fall in love with your thwart skin
You are my sweet Caribbean
Of my heart the owner
Yes Mama Yes Mama ... [x2]
[Randy:]
I get up with longing
A text message is not missing
For you to know that I'm fine
And if I get out and call me
I always answer you ...
[Chorus:]
Living in your world
You are too beautiful
For you I arrive at the women's stars
Living in your world
If I'm living in a dream
I do not want to wake up
