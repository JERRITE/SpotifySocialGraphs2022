It’s Raining Men (Live) LyricsHi (Hi!) We're your Weather Girls (Ah-huh)
And have we got news for you (You better listen)
Get ready, all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home. (Alright!)

Humidity is rising (mmm rising)
Barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)(uh-oh)
According to all sources, (What sources, now?)
The street's the place to go (We'd better hurry up)
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men! (start raining men)

It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let mysеlf get
Absolutely soaking wet!

It's raining mеn! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel and rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Ameenn!

I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin (about to begin)
Hear (Hear) the (the) thun (thun) der (der)
Don't (Don't) you (you) lose (lose) your (your) HEAD!
Rip off the roof and stay in bed
(Rip off the roof and stay in bed!)
