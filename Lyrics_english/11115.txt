Bad ‘N’ Ruin Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mother, don't you recognize your son? Ooh, ooh
Coming home, yeah, yeah
Gettin' home 'cause I failed you, mother, mmm
I'll be there in the morning, if you'll have me back
The rent up here is much too high for a room without a tap
A room without a tap, woo
I'll be early in the morning and I'll find my way back home
Back from bad 'n' ruin with my tail between my legs
Tail between my legs
And I'll be so tired
I'll be so tired, now listen
[Verse 2]
I'll be early tomorrow morning and I'll fall down off my plane
Don't be embarrassed, mother
By your ugly worn-out son, mmm
Your ugly worn-out son
So just let me warn you, mother
Mother, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now, woo

[Verse 3]
And I'll be down on Cannon Street, passport in my hand
Should you not recognize me
I've heavily made-up my eyes
Oh, momma, you won't recognize me now
Brother, you won't recognize me now
Sister, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
So mother, when you've seen me
Don't forget I'm your boy too
I know my brother has done you proud
He's one foot in the grave
Mother, don't you recognize me now? Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I'm a burglar in the first degree
But it don't seem to worry me
I'll be so tired, so tired
I'll be so tired, so tired
So tiredEmbed
