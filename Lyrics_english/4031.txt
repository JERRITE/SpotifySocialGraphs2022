Take my life back to me [letter of "return my life"]

[Chorus]
Hey, return me the life you have taken it
Every night you have stolen me
Damn jealousy that has revealed me
The illusions that have kidnapped me
Return the life you have taken you
Every night you have stolen me
With my sins there I have moved
Lower from the bridge where I love you
[Verse 1]
I burn piano black keys
Decisions are already glass
And I can't stand to think it was in vain
I need to feel that it is true
And they are not crows, my whores sound
Although they would abort the two were already mine
Look at me and tell me that I have not suffered
And look for me in lost objects
Throwing to me is easier than a dish
And when I lie to me a ray
And you know, with the devil I made a pact
I don't have a dream that is so cheap
Ephemeral is life, it is written with pencil
Dawn in Kingston and CÃ¡diz
No one told you that I was a bambi
Not being easy with me

[Chorus]
Hey, return me the life you have taken it
Every night you have stolen me
Damn jealousy that has revealed me
The illusions that have kidnapped me
Return the life you have taken you
Every night you have stolen me
With my sins there I have moved
Lower from the bridge where I love you

Kagles mocks my face
Insults me and leaves me breathless
And I can lied to everyone, but not me
And I knew I didn't love you
And that good always ends
And I've already burned our pillow
That every night of you whispered
And everything I said made its meaning
The error, to have lied
Leave your heart
A roller coaster
I no longer have another excuse
Not even the devil is scared
Not in this you and I was to blame

[Chorus]
Hey, return me the life you have taken it
Every night you have stolen me
Damn jealousy that has revealed me
The illusions that have kidnapped me
Return the life you have taken you
Every night you have stolen me
With my sins there I have moved
LOW OF THE BRIDGE WHERE I LOVE YOU1EMBED
