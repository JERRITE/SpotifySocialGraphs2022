Heart of the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come on, let’s go, baby, don’t even pack
This town feels like a cage and honey, I’m not made like that
I can see the maybe in the jasmine of your eye
I’m a Roman candle, baby, do you have a light?

[Chorus]
Put lightning in this Thunderbird 'til the metal comes alive
The rhythm of the road will give these horses wings to fly
And my true north is anywhere I can leave it all behind
Let’s point this thing west, into the chest of the still-beating heart of the night
[Verse 2]
I know thе crazy in these words coming from my mouth
But I swear that’s whеre I’m going, girl, if we don’t leave right now
I’ll be your wildfire, you be my Santa Ana wind
Turn every town we never been to into somewhere that we’ve been

[Chorus]
Yeah, put lightning in this Thunderbird 'til the metal comes alive
The rhythm of the road will give these horses wings to fly
And my true north is anywhere I can leave it all behind
Let’s point this thing west, into the chest of the still-beating heart of the night

[Bridge]
I watched my old man grow older and slower
These factory wages weighing on his shoulders
This town was a boulder that just broke his back
No, I ain’t going out like that

[Chorus]
Put lightning in this Thunderbird 'til the metal comes alive
Yeah, the rhythm of the road will give these horses wings to fly
Yeah, and my true north is anywhere I can leave it all behind
Let’s point this thing west, into the chest of the still beating heart of the nightYou might also likeEmbed
