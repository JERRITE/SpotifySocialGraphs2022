Taxi Driver Lyrics ["Taxi Driver" text]

[Verse 1]
Songs travel by taxi to clean up the roads
The strangest animals come out
I who invoked a flood that took me for hostage
But that mirror has it with me
I was driving hours, that void, made a stranger to the company
I asked her: "Where do I carry it?", Said to me: "Come on enough"
I wore something else for each race
And while you move away
I hold the thread of your sweater, naked
I have never seen you naked, I'll rush before
One night without moon, a rose without thorns
Roads connect us
The days pass the same and suddenly you
I was singing alone and suddenly you
There has never been another choice, suddenly you
[Interlude]
Luca, make us cry

[Verse 2]
Judge, jury, executioner, all together
Exploitation, alienation, unbearable choices
Twelve hours by car, the others on the diary
In the darkness of a porn cinema
I only know in a city that does not hear even if it is agitated
The abysses of a soul that does not want to shoot more
The end is "Bang" You Might Also Likeebed
