Eyes on Fire (Zeds Dead Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strain

[Verse]
I'll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared
Of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour
I'll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared
Of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour

[Drop]
I'll seek-

I- Seek-

I-I- seek

I'll seek-

Seek-

O-o-o-o-oh

I'll seek-

[Verse]
I'll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared
Of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour

[Outro]
Ahh, felling any foe with my gaze
Ahh, steadily emerging with grace

Ah
