New water lyrics as sleepy see your body 
 Fainted by me on my pillow 
 And your gray hair in pensioning 
 At dawn if I get your owner 

 New water is born in my body 
 In my dreams I have you 
 And I go to your most secret corners 
 But awake and I don't have you 

 Come stay with me 
 To save me from dying 
 Come with me to cool 
 Of New Water and Happy Sеr 
 Fulfill my dream and my Dеseo 
 Come and my desire to live 
 To stay with me 
 What do I have here for you 
 New water in me 

 At dawn if I get your owner 

 New water is born in my body 
 In my dreams I have you 
 And I go to your most secret corners 
 But awake and I don't have you 

 Come stay with me 
 To save me from dying 
 Come with me to cool 
 New water and be happy 
 Fulfill my dream and my desire 

 Come and my desire to live 
 To stay with me 
 What do I have here for you 
 New water in me
