Flyin Lyrics(Hook: Chris Webby)
I feel like im flying (I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying)
Spreadin' my wings and leave that ground
Yeah I feel like I'm flying (I'm flying, I'm flying)
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til I come down
Yeah I feel like I'm flyin' (I'm flyin', I'm flyin')

(Verse 1: Chris Webby)
Uh
Up and away
Do what I like because fuck what they say
My GPS froze
I'm stuck in my ways
I double down and throw my money and raise
I'm ballin' so hard I wake up in my J's
So go get the camera's to cover my plays
The only ways up
So it's up where I'll stay
With this bud that's so strong I'll be buzzin' for days
Chronic the color of Baby Yoda
When I crack the jar you feelin' faded, don't ya?
Yeah we take it, take it, take it, takin' over
Get it crackin' baby, get thе baking soda
Hit the motor and we in the stratosphеre
Chuck up a deuce and we outta here
Until we see UFO's out appear
As I whip that Millennium Falcon clear
Of the black holes and the comets
Just blast forward with the rockets
Higher than Falkor once upon a
Time in this never ending story I'mma
Get to the last page, if it stops there
When the crash comes
Like a stock share
Because that's life and it's not fair
But 'til then I'm on Con Air
Yeah
(Hook: Chris Webby)
I feel like im flying (I'm flying, I'm flying)
Spreadin' my wings and leave that ground
Yeah I feel like I'm flying (I'm flying, I'm flying)
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til I come down
Yeah I feel like I'm flyin' (I'm flyin', I'm flyin')
Spreadin' my wings and leave that ground
Yeah I feel like I'm flyin' (I'm flyin', I'm flyin')
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til I come down

(Verse 2: Dizzy Wright)
I'm not worried about it until I land it (Gone)
I'm taking off to another planet (Gone)
Fuckin' shit up but I didn't panic
Not an amateur, we gon' pay for the damage
Better act like you been here before, god damn it
Don't be fuckin' up my thousand dollar linen
Watchin' out for the snakes on the plane (Snakes)
Send my love to when Samuel L Jackson did it
Private jets, private livin'
This is manager, the man is spending
I can tell you ain't built to be independent
If you learn from your L's then I know you get it
I guess it's too much on my plate again
In the seven
No two city sinnin'
I'm hittin' the kitty, no kiddin'
Don't play about mine
I'mma check in for bidness
They tellin' me don't be a menace
With all the funerals I attended
When I was stuck in place I would pivot
I'm making sure that my story get written
I gotta be here for a reason
They just keep retreatin'
I was flying high into another region
Turbulence got me heavy breathin'
When the seat full I went in seizin'

I feel like im flying (I'm flying, I'm flying)
Spreadin' my wings and leave that ground
Yeah I feel like I'm flying (I'm flying, I'm flying)
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til I come down
Yeah I feel like I'm flyin' (I'm flyin', I'm flyin')
Spreadin' my wings and leave that ground
Yeah i feel like I'm flyin' (I'm flyin', I'm flyin')
Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til I come downEmbed
