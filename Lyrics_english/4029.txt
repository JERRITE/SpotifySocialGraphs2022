Repentida Lyricsletra "Repentant"

[Intro]
Trying to see you is a challenge
I imagine waking you to me
False illusions cold hearts but how do I make you understand

That every time I see your photo
I fall in love with that angel's face
I don't know why you keep being with him
Tell him that when he leaves you are unfaithful
(Juaka)
[Chorus]
And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden

And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you pass it better
I want to be your coat on one of those cold nights
You are envy in drought hearts
And you are mine baby

I want to see you making those movements that one day I in my mind imagined
Look like the life I dreamed of and now I see you naked in my bed

Tell him
That in your feelings I am
That since he does not attend you
You are looking for in my shelter and heat
And that's it
You might also like
You're a beauty
Whenever I do it returns
I treat her as a princess
Tell me who hugs you and who kisses you

[Pre-car]
find me
If you think we both have a good time
In my room I am doing my hostage
I don't know why you keep enduring me
Talk clearly to me

find me
If you think we both have a good time
In my room I am doing my hostage
I don't know why you keep enduring me
Talk clearly to me

[Chorus]
And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden
And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden

[Verse 2]
If he knew
That I look for you at the university at Panamera and that before leaving you made 5,000 in the portfolio
Mamacita

If you left me in your arms, I slept and within you I lost it and if in front of me I diverted you
And you recognized that I have to offer you an entire life

What is lost does not recover
I am and I will be your cloth of tears
And you my faithful companion, baby

I remember when I kissed you the first time
That you were nervous and I could appreciate your nakedness
You told me that he did not do it like me
That's why you called me to do it again â€™again

[Pre-car]
find me
If you think we both have a good time
In my room I am doing my hostage
I don't know why you keep enduring me
Talk clearly to me

find me
If you think we both have a good time
In my room I am doing my hostage
I don't know why you keep enduring me
Talk clearly to me

[Chorus]
And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden

And that's it
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Tell you that you are repentant
It does not treat you well neglects you
That's why we see each other hidden
