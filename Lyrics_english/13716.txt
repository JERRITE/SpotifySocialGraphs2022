Perfect Crime Lyrics[Refrain]
Quick, what's better than me?
But I don't give a shit what you sayin' to me
Yeah, stay checkin' for me
When you want smoke you can get it for free

[Verse 1]
Don't call
I don't wanna think about us at all
It still hurts way too much
Bleed out
From the knife here in my chest that you left
My heart's not healing up
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm masochistic
I can't help but love it
It hurts so bad, it hurts so good
Dying all alone, no one will ever know

[Chorus]
Perfect crime, killin' me
'Cause nobody gonna ever see
What you've done, got away
You will never live a guilty day
Perfect crime, crime, crime

[Refrain]
Quick, what's better than me?
But I don't give a shit what you sayin' to me
Yeah, stay checkin' for me
When you want smoke, you can get it for free

[Verse 2]
In the end, I won't need ya
Pourin' up my medicine and tequila
And champagne, know when I'm mixin'
If I don't make it through the night, still be winnin'
I'm okay, one more shot, take the pain away
Thursday night, bottles free
It's the scene of a...
You might also like[Chorus]
Perfect crime, killin' me
'Cause nobody gonna ever see
What you've done, got away
You will never live a guilty day

[Post-Chorus]
I need your love, I need your touch
I need a friend
I need a heart, I need a pulse
To breathe again
(No, no, no, no, no)

[Outro]
I come alive in the night, in the moonlight
Yeah, I wanna feel alive with you
Yeah, I wanna shake my ass in the moonlight
Yeah, I'm gonna drop that down with you
Yeah, I wanna see us dance in the moonlight
Yeah, I wanna feel alive with you
Yeah, I wanna see us dance in the moonlight
Yeah, I wanna drop that down with you10Embed
