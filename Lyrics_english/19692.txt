Iron Sight Lyrics[Intro]
Muhh, skuhh, dripping in sauce, alla dat, gang
ZCBeats
Niggas know what it is, Stizz, brr, muhh
Look
Skuhh, muhh

[Chorus: Stickz]
Jump out cars with no remorse, give him the juice, give him the sauce
Swing that shit, do it with force, split him in two like he got a divorce
[Verse 1: Stickz]
Cannabis in my system, say you fucked my girl, I'm like "which one?"
Send the .44 bang and that shit spun, turn a brave opp boy to a victim
Come on bro, you don’t risk it, we know you're a mug and I'll dip like biscuit
Mow man down in this 4 door car, you’re under the whip like you work for Kwik Fit
Raw cup, I don't mix it, make a gyal get on her knees and fix it
Man do drills, day and night
Old school mash, iron sight
You'll get smacked, I don't fight
Or you might get whacked if the AD's slide
Or you might get whacked if the AD's slide

[Verse 2: Mayhem]
Run tru' pack like racists, how does Maynizz finesse them cases?
They claim they're paigons, half these brehs don’t know their faces
Do it in road or jail, I’m in the jailhouse riding basic
What you know about losses? They just split like half of my savings
I'm just bait, now they all wanna know, now it’s like they think I'm famous
They won't put my shit on the playlist, so I just move these packs on the pavement
Two bunny with the skeng doe, don't give me the chance, I’ll stain it
The way I chop these bricks, amazing, we do it like Freddy and Jason
Went from bang up at 6, now I'm back with a bang with Stizz
Too much new niggas, now I'm tryna cop me a new ting
Three times I've been to the jailhouse, this is the life we live
Do wrong for the right but we living a life of sin
I'm in the T house, bruck down pack, I ain't binning this Lyca sim
You know how much pack I ran tru'? Trapper of the Year, I might just win
They say I can't do this from bud, they see me and just smile and grin
Niggas switch sides like Caitlyn, niggas are bitch, they sly like Kim

As long as it buss', 4 from the wap, don't watch that it's rusted
Drill over there and the scene got dusted, served your bro, he was doing up custard
Bro with the wap, now it's fostered, step over there and they're gonna need doctors
Drill scene full of imposters, doing up T but it wasn't in Costa's

[Verse 4: Mayhem]
In the field, no training, how many been shot, [?] blatant
I weren't made for the kitchen, I can whip but I've got no patience
No comment in the station, how many man been left as a patient?
Yeah, I got dipped but he got dipped, lurk in Elm like Freddy and Jason
Hate on who? Boys ain't on piss, how many times have I hopped out whips?
Dip, splash, man get chinged, I push weight but I don't mean gym
Yeah, I took some L's but how many times have I win?
This is the life I live, my life is nothing but sin

[Verse 5: Stickz]
On Pistol P, no goofy can't be in my hood
On Pistol P, certain mans wifey been on my hood
4s in the Canada Goose, big boy corn, make you handle your juice
Give gyal Henny and Boost, she ask for a twos, I gotta refuse
Roll up and give you the blues, UDN gonna spread that news
Did that and left no clues, bro-bro chased him, he left his shoes

[Chorus: Stickz]
Jump out cars with no remorse, give him the juice, give him the sauce
Swing that shit, do it with force, split him in two like he got a divorce1Embed
