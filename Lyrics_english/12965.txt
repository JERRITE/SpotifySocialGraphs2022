Once Twice Melody Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out in the summer sun
She was the only one
Days go by
In her eyes
Belle de jour in front of me
No matter where you go
There'll always be your shadow

[Chorus]
(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody
[Verse 2]
The purple on the vine
The velveteen tree line
Nights fly by
In her mind
All along the boulevard
She tries to understand
A never-never land

[Chorus]
(La-la-la) Across thе room
(La-la-la) Sweet perfume
The sun, thе moon, the raindrops too

[Pre-Chorus]
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

[Pre-Chorus]
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

[Outro]
Once, twice, Melody4Embed
