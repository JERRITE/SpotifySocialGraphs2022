You Donâ€™t Know Me (radio edit) LyricsWhat is my problem with man, you ask?
No, I ask you what is man's problem with me

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life?

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life?
I don't ask for nothing
I'm always holding my own
Everytime I turn around
There's something

People talking about what they don't know
And when I try to move on up
They always pulling me down

I'm tired and I've had enough
It's my life
And I'm living it now
You don't know...

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me

I always wonder why
People try to hurt me
No happiness in their own lives
So they act by all their jealousy
