Sleep Baby Sleep Lyrics[Hook]
Sleep baby sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep baby sleep
I lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

[Verse 1]
I could be the one to give you all I am
With a gentle touch and a foolish love
You could be the one to carry all my troubles away
With the words you say, all I need to hear so
[Hook]
Sleep baby sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep baby sleep
I lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

[Verse 2]
Ignorance is torture but your love is right
Tip to tip a gentleman of the night
You feed my fascination with your skin like silk
And I'm still filled with wonder you could fool me easily so

[Hook]
Sleep baby sleep
What are you waiting for?
The morning's on its way
You know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep baby sleep
I lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

[Bridge]
So lay here and press up next to me
Cause we'll be alright, we'll be alright
But when we leave I know it's hard
Cause it's all we know but we'll be alright, we'll be alright, right
