Beavis & Butt-head Lyrics[Intro: Sad Frosty]
Ayy
What?
Trademark
Okay

[Chorus: Sad Frosty & DC The Don]
My bitch wear designer, she bougie as hell
Big chopper right on me, we wishing them well
Pussy boy talking, we send him to hell
Bitch, Tony Montana, we wrappin' the bales
I'm in the Scatty, I'm switching them lanes
XD wet him up on sight, long range
Nerf Gun, it's on me, I spray with no aim
And this T-dub-G, niggas know it's gon' bang
[Verse: Sad Frosty & DC The Don]
2020, bitch, they know we the wave
Bitch, I gotta have it, bought a Patek today
That bitch she a dub, on my mama, she plain
Get the bag, run it up, then I go on a skate
I'm independent, I'm holdin' my weight (Yeah)
I was ridin' in Hondas, now I'm in a Wraith
This Gucci bandana, wе bustin' his grape
Fuck buyin' a chain, I spent that on some Bapеs
Me and DC on some new shit
We started a wave and they copied the blueprint
Your bitch, she a thot, on my dick, she be choosin'
She peepin' the wave, she fuck for the movement, damn
Yo, DC, why they trippin'?
Bro, I couldn't even tell you, I'm out on a mission
Dip and dash on these folks, movin' through opposition
We gon' handle your scar, bitch, we'll do the division
Bitch want me to cuff her, ho, play your position (Thot)
I handle business 'fore rap, boy, you trippin'
We gon' run in your back door, bitch, this an eviction
Had to stand in the trap and my wrist in the kitchen, ayy
I got a bitch, she gon' do what I say so
Hundred-round drum, we give that boy a halo (Brrt, blaow)
Niggas strapped up, better lay low
I be peelin' my shit, she gon' do what I say so (Yeah)
Woah, and I'm so high right now, I'ma move like a AO
He talkin' tough, but he still on his shit
If my bro tryna come up, I'll put him on payroll (Ayy)
What these niggas tryna do? He frontin'
Big body pullin' up, we stuntin'
Bentley Bentayga got too many buttons (Ayy)
DC and Frosty, bitch, we came from nothin' (Okay)
