RM - Seoul (Prod. Honne) (Danish Translation) Lyrics [Verse 1]
With the dawn's cold air
I secretly open my eyes
The harmony of the city, it is so familiar to me
My youth days seem so far away
And now it's filled with buildings and cars
But this is my home now (Seoul, Seoul)

[Verse 2]
Why do you sound like “soul”?
What kind of soul is that you have?
What holds me back by your side?
I don't even have anything to remind you of you
I'm so tired of you now
The same old ash gray face every day
No, no i'm afraid of myself
For I have already become part of you
[Chorus]
If love and hate are the same words
Do i love you seoul
If love and hate are the same words
Do i love you seoul
If love and hate are the same words
Do i love you seoul
If love and hate are the same words
I love you Seoul (Seoul)

[Verse 3]
Buses with changing landscapes even when i sit still
And similar buildings actually vary slightly
The scent of life that could be disgusting or not
And the cold parks that seem to be hot
People who always have to wander
And the male river that carries too much he
And the swings that can't even look at the sky
And the kids totally adults, and me who's a little delayed

[Verse 4]
My friends often say they will go
I nod but i cant smile
I hate to admit it but
I already love your fumes and the clumsyness
Love the fished smell of cheonggyechon
Love the loneliness of Seonyudo
“It's a nice place to live if you have money”
Even sigh from some taxi drivers
I love you all
