Separate me from the rest of the herd so
I can run away from all of my hurt, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want it and I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)
Weave a story so I don't have to talk, no
It's not a problem if I never get caught, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want it and I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)
[Chorus]
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
(Hey)
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin' now
(Ahhh)

[Verse 2]
Hide your demons where no one can see 'em
Out of sight but in your mind you believe them
Drink what you want
Be what you want
Say what they want you to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want it and I'm afraid
(Ahhh)
Do you think, do you think that they notice?
I keep a bottle by my bed, it's a focus
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what they want you to say, like
I can pretend that I don't want it and I'm afraid
(I'm dangerous)

Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh

[Bridge]
This is not a problem if I don't want it to stop
Can't call it a problem if I never let a plate drop
This is not a problem if convincin' that it's not (Oh)
Don't call it a problem, it's the only thing that I still got

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, oh
Hey, I know
Down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh

[Chorus]
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I'm not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh5Embed
