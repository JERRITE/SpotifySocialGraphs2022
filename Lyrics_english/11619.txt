â€‹forwards beckon rebound Lyrics[Verse 1]
Over the Dead Sea
Keeping you company
Thinking, "I'm not afraid of you now
I'm not afraid of you now"
Letting my eyes close
Shedding my soft clothes
Wind blows
Wind that howls like a hound
Wind that laughs like a clown
[Chorus]
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound

[Verse 2]
Virtual bedroom
Rise like a full moon
Show me pictures that hang in your house
Pictures that hang in your mouth
Candescent insects
Crosses and fishnecks
I have nothing to pray to you now
Nothing to pray to you now

[Chorus]
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Pulling your face close, wanting the inmost
Show me
I'm not afraid of you now
I'm not afraid of you now
Villain and violent, infant and innocent
Baby, both arms cradle you now
Both arms cradle you now
You might also like[Chorus]
Mystery of lack
Stabbing stars through my back
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound
Forwards, beckon, rebound3Embed
