In the Trap - Remix Lyrics [letter of "in the trap - remix" ft. Lleflight]

[Pre-stribe: LLEFLIFGHT, Pablo Chill-e]
I'm flying short and I don't take Red Bull (without wing ')
Shishigang, we are Dream Team to Chicago Bulls
I'm flying short and I don't take Red Bull (without wing ')
Shishigang, we are Dream Team to Chicago Bulls
The rhyme of the short guard 'in the trunk (the 11)
They have no pa 'stir and are talking about full
(La-la-la-selling, hahaha)
Young J, Star
J Star On The Track
Shishigang
(La-la-la-selling)
[Chorus: LLAFLIFGHT]
I'm leaving the street because I live in the trap
In the trap, Shishigang, Tamo 'in the trap (the trap)
They tell me that they are going but I leave them 'Atrá', Yeah (in La Capocha)
'So attaches', you are attacked'

I am leaving the street because I live in the trap (pew-pew-pew)
In the Trap, Shishigang, Tamo 'on the trap (Shishigang, Shishigang, Shishigang)
They tell me that they are going but I leave them 'Atrá', Yeah
'So ATRÁ', Yeah

[Verse 1: LLEFLIFGHT]
They say they are up to it but no matter how much I look for them, I don't see them (where?)
I am not the best but in the letter Los Paseo (Ronaldo)
Compare with what is being fought this is fogueo (pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
I do my diligence, I don't trace with the Joseo
E-e-is very easy to see it, not doing it I walk purine
They say they are zopi, I look at them as aspirin
Pa'l that throws the pela ', I am minor and I go for up (gang, gang, gang)
They don't stop because I surely rob the chair (huh)
The-the-selling

[Verse 2: Pablo Chill-e]
I'm flying short and I don't talk to you about Lan
White as a baker but I don't cook bread (coca)
That [?] I came out toad was not part of my plan (Chota)
In the trap making monrra the species pa 'la van
I get a pill, I rob the chair
Your mai asked where your tilla were '(where?)
Under pa'l event with to'a my squad
The Paco 'They want to throw our pats'
Tamo 'on the trap that I am little
Selling the Clona, selling Pitito (Prr, Rah)
If I don't tell Xander, eating a client
I'm with Young King committing crime
You are a trapo (hahaha)
My best friend is the turns and the Napo
Pablito with Ki, Shiefkieff with the boss
We are not pretty 'but we are handsome'
Free Gucci Lean, I don't tell you about [?] (Free)
[?] With mine, I am flexin ', no [?]
You can tell me nothing
And you know why? Because he was in the tra '

I am leaving the street because I grew up in the trap (pa-pa-pa)
In the PAC, Shishigang Tamo 'in the Trap (SHI)
With Ladrone 'and trafficker' when you sing rap (feka)
In the trap when you were not 'in na'

I'm leaving the street because I live in the trap (pew, pew, pew)
In the Trap, Shishigang, Tamo 'on the trap (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
They tell me that they are going but I leave them 'Atrá', Yeah (Yeah)

I'm flying short and I don't take Red Bull (without wing ')
Shishigang, we are Dream Team to Chicago Bulls
The rhyme of the short guard 'in the trunk (the 11)
They have no pa 'stir and are talking about full, Yeah
[Verse 3: LLEFLIFGHT]
Do not throw anyone but I'm save.
They fell asleep and they don't realize, I went through them
I am the fusion between Mayweather with Manny Pacquiao (Los Menore ')
Don't talk how I cry 'If you are daddy [?]
[?] I don't take me with chip '
[?] Zero to one hundred, and I leave them out of the route
[?] Enjoy, I deal with the whore
And if I jump complainant, my gun executes it

[Chorus: LLAFLIFGHT]
To the street because I live in the trap (pew, pew, pew)
In the trap, Shishigang, Tamo 'in the trap (the trap)
They tell me that they are going but I leave them 'Atrá', Yeah (in La Capocha)
'So attaches', you are attacked'

I am leaving the street because I live in the trap (pew-pew-pew)
In the Trap, Shishigang, Tamo 'on the trap (Shishigang, Shishigang, Shishigang)
You believe are going to the 'Atrá', Yeah
'So ATRÁ', Yeah
