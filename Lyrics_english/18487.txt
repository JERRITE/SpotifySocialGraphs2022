Say Anything (Else) Lyrics[Intro]
And baby don't follow their lead
'Cause you'll never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes
And you are so confused
And baby, it's just like you
To say anything else

[Verse 1]
Whenever you get this way
Just getting up for the letdown
Mmm, here they come and yes, they're here to stay
Just getting up for the letdown
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm here to say that you're the star you want to be
Just open up and look inside and you will see, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, you'll sing it out loud
One day, this will make you proud
Whoa-oh, "I know"
Whoa-oh

[Pre-Verse]
And baby, don't follow their lead
'Cause you never know
Just how the story ends, or how the story goes
And you are so confused
And baby, its just like you
To say anything else

[Verse 2]
It's time for you to understand
Stop getting up for the letdown
Oh, who you want is not up to them
Stop getting up for the letdown

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm here to say that you're the star you want to be
Just open up and look inside and you will see, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Someday, you'll sing it out loud
One day, this will make you proud
Whoa-oh, "I know"
Whoa-oh
Someday, you'll sing it out loud
One day, this will make you proud
Whoa-oh, "I know"
"I know" is never good enough

[Bridge]
So say what you want
(You know I'm wasting all my time)
You gotta mean it when you say what you want
(You're only safe when you're alone)
And everybody's on your mind
Saying anything to get you by
And so to get what you want
(You know I'm wasting all my time)
You gotta mean it when you say what you want
(You're only safe when you're alone)
You're wasting everybody's time
You're saying anything that gets you by
It's not, not, not gonna get you
G-Gonna get you by
[Chorus]
Someday, you'll sing it out loud
One day, this will make you proud
Whoa-oh, "I know"
"I know" is never good enough
Someday, you'll sing it out loud
One day, this will make you proud
Whoa-oh, "I know"
Whoa-oh

[Outro]
Whoa-oh, "I know"
"I know" is never good enough1Embed
