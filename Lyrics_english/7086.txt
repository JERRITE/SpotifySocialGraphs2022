Bad Intentions Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is the face I wear treading the riptide
Abysmal oceans where good girls go to die
I wanna love somebody
Wanna feel their love on me
But after everything I still believe in true love
Not being able to find it
Damn, it tears me up
And I know it's my fault, I know it's my fault
Let's take a trip, ten thousand miles above the clouds
We can stay up here until we figure it out
I don't wanna go home
Don't wanna be alone, be alone
[Hook 1]
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood, heat, over tension
And I know, oh-woah-oh

[Verse 2]
You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes
I don't wanna die

[Hook 2]
I just got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)
Haven't learned my lesson (Learned my lesson), woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions, woah
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh

I know we made a graveyard of this song (Mmm)
I know I don't feel too sober now (No, no)
I wanna lie awake with your black soul (Ooh)
Count your fears if you let me

[Hook 3]
Baby, I just want your damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions, woo
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh64Embed
