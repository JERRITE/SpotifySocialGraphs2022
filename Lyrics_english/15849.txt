I send you flowers lyrics [lyrics by "I send you flowers"]

[Verse 1]
I send you flowers that I pick up the way
I send them to you between my dreams
Because I can't talk to you
And I send you kisses in my songs
And at night when I sleep
Our hearts come together

[Verse 2]
You turn air
Yes at night there is a full moon
If I feel cold in the morning
Your memory warms me
And your smile when you wake up
My pretty girl, I swear
That every day I see you closer
[Pre-car]
And among my sleeping dreams
I try to talk to you and feel close to me
I want to have you in my arms
Be able to go out and hug you and never let you go

[Chorus]
I want to find you in my dreams
That I get up with kisses
No place is far to find us both
Let me shake hands to have you by my side
My girl, I promise you that I will always be your love
Do not go please

[Musical Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I send you flowers that I pick up the way
I send them to you between my dreams
Because I can't talk to you
And I'm preparing ten thousand words
To convince you that by my side
Everything will be how we dream

[Pre-car]
And among my sleeping dreams
I try to talk to you and feel close to me
I want to have you in my arms
Be able to go out and hug you and never let you go
You Might Also Like [Choir]
I want to find you in my dreams
That I get up with kisses
No place is far to find us both
Let me shake hands to have you by my side
My girl, I promise you that I will always be your love
Do not go please

[Outro]
(Dale Cali)
I send you flowers to adore your house
That the most red are always at the entrance
Every morning they don't miss water
Early Early Get up watering them
You can give each one a name
To always attend your call
Nice little thing can be the fattest
THE MARGARITA WHICH IS MARIANA

I send you flowers to adore your house
That the most red are always at the entrance
Every morning they don't miss water
Early Early Get up watering them
You can give each one a name
To always attend your call
Nice little thing can be the fattest
THE MARGARITA WHICH IS MARIANA
I send you flowers to adore your house
That the most red are always at the entrance
Every morning they don't miss water
Early Early Get up watering them
You can give each one a name
To always attend your call
Nice little thing can be the fattest
And the Margarita called Mariana1embed
