SHINing Love Song Lyrics [Lan "Shining Love Song" lyrics] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Your heart fills my heart 
 I like purple sneakers 
 Your staircase 
 I like the shaking necklace 

 [Chorus] 
 Always to you 
 I'll approach like a fool 
 A rumor of summer night 
 Until the truth 
 Always only you 
 Looking at and worrying 
 Lightly 
 I want to be a person 
 [Verse 2] 
 Returning with a sad heart 
 I keep becoming shabby 
 You always shine 
 I keep running as if I'm caught 

 [Chorus] 
 Always to you 
 I'll approach like a fool 
 A rumor of summer night 
 Until the truth 
 Always only you 
 Looking at and worrying 
 Lightly 
 I want to be a person you might Also likeembed
