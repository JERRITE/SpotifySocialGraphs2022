You Stop My Heart LyricsI'm so excited I can't get past one, two, three
I'm so impatient, it's everything you do to me
A little fire mixed in good with desire
Makes my heart sing like a choir
I'm on a respirator whenever he leaves

Cause you stop my heart
I can't focus on anything
Cause you stop my heart
And you get to beat it back again
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my heart again

It's never private, he tells the whole world 'bout me
I can't fight it, he's taking all the air I breathe
It's on purpose, so take no list of this hurtin'
I just wanna keep on flirting cause I know that I deserve him

Cause you stop my heart
I can't focus on anything
Cause you stop my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my heart again

You surround me like I wanna
Cause I love you
You will give this heart a murmur
If I lost you

Cause you stop my heart
I can't focus on anything
You stop my my my my my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You stop my heart
