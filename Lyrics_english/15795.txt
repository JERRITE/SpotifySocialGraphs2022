AWARD LYRICSNO heart, I can't understand
Because love fills us with surprises;
His perfume wrapped me
And now suddenly evaporates

I drain from among my skin
And it was much faster, revashing my borders
And I get loneliness, but I have to escape
To live with new forces

Forward heart no more
That life without pain does not know the same;
It is unitile to wait
I don't want to die of love
Forward heart do not cry anymore
That the road is still long to love;
You have to beat very strong
That life already expects

Yes, I still want to believe
I want to recover illusions;
My wounds will close, and they will be the scar
That I do give me

Because life is love
You will keep beating today
Turning up

Forward heart do not cry anymore
That the road is still long to love;
You have to beat very strong
That life already expects

Crazy, I had it in my hands
And I slept in his arms
And while I'm crying
He with her row

Forward heart no more
That life without pain does not know the same;
It is unitile to wait
I don't want to die of love
You might also like the heart do not cry anymore
That the road is still long to love;
You have to beat very strong
That life awaits Yaembed
