Here With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You give me highs to lose my breath
That leave me wanting more
You gave me lows I won’t forget
That left me on the floor
You’re everything
And nothing else is ever what it seems
Until the lights go dark, until the end of me

[Chorus]
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow, to follow you
Through every waking hour
Through all that time devours
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
[Verse 2]
I pray for this to never end
'Cause I just couldn’t breathe
And now the fear of losing you
Is the ghost that haunts my dreams
And if you tell me all is lost
Then I would give you hope
'Cause without you I don’t exist
And I go cold

[Chorus]
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow, to follow you
Through every waking hour
Through all that time devours
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you

[Bridge]
Now I see what I couldn’t believe
All the things you were saying to me
It’s taken me so long (It’s taken me so long) It’s taken me so long
All my walls, they are falling to dust
Until you, I never knew how to trust
It’s taken me so long, It’s taken me so long
You gave me lows I won’t forget
That left me on the floor
You gave me highs to lose my breath
You might also like[Chorus]
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you
Walk off the world just to follow, to follow you
Through every waking hour
Through all that time devours
I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with you

I’d give up all my tomorrows
To be here with youEmbed
