I don't kneel lyrics [lyrics by "I don't kneel"]

[Intro: Almight]
I don't kneel
I don't kneel, no
I do not stounce—
I don't kneel or Mordecao
Do not condemn the Christian 'like Hamán
They say they are from Dio ', but they don't love
They have other gods' like the Muslim
If you know a single body
Why a part of this body do you want to cut?
Says that in your church I do not
Just because this I want to sing
[Choir: Almighty & Manny Montes]
The Baptist came with camel hair
They look straight for tennis that do not use it '
Having money is not sin, better read
The one who bought the grave was José de Arimea
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH (YEAH)
The one who bought the grave was José de Arimea (Ah!)

[Verse 1: Manny Montes]
I don't even kneel even if they built me ​​with a brick '
THE WALLLA 'THE TUMBO WITH HAMMER (YEAH)
Word, many people don't live what speaks
I'm cracking cement, you keep cracking table (JA)
Let's see if I build something with such firewood
Why does it insist 'to cut the wing' to whom he dreams =
His 'great' pact 'mind' thought
They want to get into my life without password (What?)
If my tennis collection and 'love to silver
What about your suit collection 'and tie?
If he 'the same body, why does he mistreat me'?
Haven't you seen how music 'rescues it?
Mosqueda, by comment 'I don't go back
Christ comes (yeah) and little time is left
They want to get in cage 'e chicken being eagle
I just kneel down like Yiye Ávila (Ah!)

[Verse 2: Almighty]
The disciples were poor, who was going to buy the grave?
God uses even the rich ', your tomb argument
The problem does not reggaeton, merengue or cumbia
The problem e 'your mind that e' like murky water
Do you think the devil supports that I use a word
On the theme 'what do I do and what mind' open? Nope
He prefers to speak of sin
They don't want me to preach, they want me away
Get, Satan, that you are in hindering me
You don't see things as God sees them, yours is morbid
I only trust what heals Sordo '
Your Cross position on your shoulder
I save if I name it, look at me from your throne
Don't kneel if it's not to pray to him
To the Juda 'lion of the tribe of Israel
Manny, vamo 'pa'l monte to look for a presence
To talk about God does not need 'license
[Outro: Almighty]
Blessed the father, blessed the son
Blessed the Holy and Blessed Spirit be the Word
Put yourself to rescue souls, that e 'the mission
You don't have to divide, if you are a body
