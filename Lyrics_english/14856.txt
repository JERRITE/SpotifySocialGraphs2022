Beguiled Lyrics[Verse 1]
So swallow hard the serpents
Of many tags and faces hid in masks
Coiled 'round this lung until the last
He’ll crack your boots, young pagans
'Cause like you, I was hatched to traipse on cold
And seventeen's a long drawn way from home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ve learned these lessons I was taught
Taught, so taught
And now I'm telling you
[Chorus]
Return the faith
Return the faith
They're smashing out the veils, return the faith
And there's no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades, return the faith
You've gotta move

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
So as bеtrayed by rainbows
Here, I convеy I've sold out your dear cause
And the king has placed us in his jaws
It's sure no place can hold us
But in this scene, I'm December
And your June’s wretch
And my idyls lay gasping as if death

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ve learned these lessons I was taught
Taught, so taught
And now I'm telling you

[Chorus]
Return the faith
Return the faith
They’re smashing out the veils, return the faith
And there's no escape
So return the faith
With charging light brigades, return the faith
You've gotta move

[Outro]
Return the faith (Return the faith)
Return the faith (Return the faith)
Return the faith1Embed
