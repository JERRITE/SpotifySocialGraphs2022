For seeing you again, I see you see
Camarinar to the world
Steaming thorns sweating my soul
Tearing my feet
To see you again
Today sweet exchange
The rest of my life
For just one night with you skin by skin
For just one night the rest of my life
For just one night with you dear
And if there is life after death
I also change it to see you again
And you were my first love
And another I have not found again
Although Angeles from heaven fall
A love first cannot be forgotten
Is that you were my first love
And another will not have again
And that's why Daria would glad
The rest of my life to see you again
By becoming
I would get into a story
To ask a genius to change
My time for yesterday
To see again
The brightness of your eyes
When I made you
Under that red sky of that sunset
For just one night the rest of my life
For just one night with you dear
And if there is life after death
I also change it to see you again
And you were my first love
And another I have not found again
Although Angeles from heaven fall
A love first cannot be forgotten
Is that you were my first love
And another will not have again
And that's why Daria would glad
The rest of my life to see you again
And you were my first love
And another I have not found again
Although Angeles from heaven fall
A love first cannot be forgotten might also likembed
