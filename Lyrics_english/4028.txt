THE INDEPENDENT LYRICS [LETTER OF "LA INDEPENDENT"]

[Verse 1: Alejandro Santamaria]
She arrived dressed in red
He began to dance (Yeh), in front of me (eh-eh), stinging my eye
I looked up from top to bottom
I said without a calm relax that with me
You will not pass work and she said
"It can be, that story I know" (which can be)
You better take a drink, calm that I pay
And I thought aloud that it was God who brought it (Yeh)
And she said "It can be, vamo 'let's see" (vamo' to see)
[Coro: Alejandro Santamaria]
And I had to suffer
Because it's smart, maybe different
I did not know to say
I can't with her, what a beautiful woman
And I had to suffer
But even if I say, I'm not like a madman after his footprint
That makes me hot, an independent woman

[Verse 2: Pitizion]
La Piti ', the Pitizion
I a whiskey in the rocks he took wine
I think a malbec of those Argentines
We had a good time (we had a good time)
But I'm not one of those who go from zero to one hundred (one hundred)
I took me for my house, I said: "Then I am writing you
You don't pass them from the door, you don't throw them out "
How about the madman?
If what lasts goes little by little

[Chorus: Pitizion]
And it was his turn to suffer
Because I talked straight ahead, I think differently
He didn't know what to say
For your proposal, I had an answer
He had to suffer
Even if he tells him not he is still like a madman after my footprint
Because an independent woman puts it hot
(Independent, an independent woman)

She returned to the same place
Everything changed no longer goes alone
Go with me (aha)

[Coro: Alejandro Santamaria, both]
And I had to suffer
Because it's smart, think differently
I did not know to say
I can't with her, what a beautiful woman
And I had to suffer
But even if I say, I'm not like a madman after his footprint
Because it makes me hot, an independent woman
