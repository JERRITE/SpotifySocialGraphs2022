Best Day of My Life Lyrics[Intro]
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)

[Verse 1]
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high, I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh (wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh (wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
2, 3, 4â€¦

[Chorus]
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

[Post-Chorus]
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)
(Wooh-ooh-wooh)

[Verse 2]
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh (wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh (wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)
