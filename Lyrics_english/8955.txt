Fire and Water LyricsEvery single day I got a heartache coming my way
I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears in my eyes
I don't wanna say goodbye mama
But look at the way you made me cry
Every way that's nice you show
You've got a heart of ice
And I know

Fire and water
Must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes
To make a poor man's heart break
A poor man's heart break
Lover you turn me on
But quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
But I'm gonna try and make you grieve somehow

Fire and water
Must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes
To make a poor man's heart break
A poor man's heart break
And my heart is breaking...

I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears you made me cry
Every way that's nice you show
You've got a heart made of ice
And I know

Fire and water
Must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes
To make a poor man's heart break
Fire fire and water
Must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes
To make a poor man's heart breakYou might also likeEmbed
