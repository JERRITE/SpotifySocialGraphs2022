[Intro: Darell & Ozuna]
WO-OH
Oh oh oh oh)
Wo-Oh, Yeh (Yeh-Yeh)
This E 'The True Remix, Baby! (NA-NA)
That is like that (ozuna)
I spend a lot of 'night' thinking
I don't know how or when it was (huh)
But I only know that I remembered (eh-eh)
How did I do it that time (OH-OH)
Yes, I can't continue alone (hehe)
But I know that I bothered you (but I know; I bothered you)
[Chorus: ozuna]
From my life I bot, yeh, and bot I (oh-oh)
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you (oh-oh)
Pal 'fuck usté' left, and uté 'left (na-na)
From my life I bot, I bot, yeh, Yeh, Mommy (Ozuna)

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
Baby, life and 'a cycle (wuh)
And what does not use it does not recycle (no)
So my life move
That if I put it e 'pa' remember a t.b.t., Yeh (Yeh)
I already tired of your lie '
Now there is a tougher that throws me (Yeh)
Everything has its end, everything expires (Yeh)
You ere 'past and the past never turns
Pal 'fucking (wuh!), My body does not need you (no)
What asks and 'a dirty perreo in the placita
I don't think ours is repeated
Give him, turn on a Phillie, leave one read for now, Yeh (Brr!)

[Pre-stribe: Bad Bunny]
I hate knowing that once more 'I trusted
I hate to 'lo' "I love you" that a thousand vece 'I text you
Baby, better than you, now I have as die '
Ours was in a bugatti and you stayed on foot

I bothered you; I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pal 'fuck I sent you, I sent you
And your friend was nailed, I nailed it
Fuck you, son 'e whore, Yeh (Huh!)

[Verse 2: Darell]
(This E 'The True Tour, did you hear, baby'?)
Baby, I drove you (ha!)
And since I gave you that 'Botá', the cat 'are tre' in tre '(that is like that)
If you want, 'ask, if you don't believe me' (Baby)
That I no longer have it ', pa' complete the rows are express (Ja-Ja!)
Did you see how the world went upside down '?
And I with her in R.D. (Hahahaha), which fell in love with the day I tried it
I don't think I return and give you, Mommy, because the service was canceled
If I do not answer (ha!) The problem will play background
Mommy, breathe deep while I hide it (that is like that)
With you forcing today I put the condom
But I post a half court, Baby, like Rondón (ha!)
I gave you a hard burial (that's it)
I know that over time the wound is cured (by law)
E 'that in Verdá' that you are not 'at that point (ha!)
I swear to you, although I did not swear (ra-ta-ta-tá!)

[Chorus: Darell & Nio García]
Baby, I bothered you (E 'I drink you)
I gave you a band and I released you (I gave you a band and I released you; pa 'what knows')
Pa'l fuck I sent you, huh, huh (is you 'understanding what I am' wanting to say?; Pa'l I sent you)
From my life I took you, huh, huh (this is the true turn; real g4 life, my nigga, huh!)
[Verse 3: Magic casper]
(We are the magical, baby; casper!)
Pa'l fuck I bot (pa'l fucking you; wouh!)
I feel good without you (without you I feel good; ah)
I no longer suffer for love ', now I break hearts'
And there are plenty of the paca 'of one hundred (the paca' of one hundred)
You broke my heart (you broke my heart; Wuh!)
Without sense and without reason (without meaning and without reason; ah)
But I have a new ass that gives me a lot of love
And I fuck well bastard (good bastard)

[Chorus: magic casper]
I don't vote for you to suffer, I had a bad time
But I overcome you and from my life I bot (I bot)
And I gave you a band and I released you (and I released you)
And I don't want to know (I want to know)
And for the damn I sent you, I'm going to drink today (I'm going to drink)

[Verse 4: ozuna]
Ozuna
From my life I bot and I know that no one '
I will spend my whole life asking where it was
But your friend texts me whenever she wishes me
A photo is thrown with me and tells me: "Pa 'that you see it"

[Saying: ozuna]
I turn on for seeing if I forgot
From your name, your kiss ', your body, your groan' (oh)
I did it in the car, I shouted in my ear
I close the eye 'and I think of everything I did', baby (oh-oh, baby)
I turn on for seeing if I forgot
From your name, your kiss ', your body, your groan' (oh-oh)
I did it in the car, I shouted in my ear
I close the eye 'and I think of everything I did', baby (oh)

[Verse 5: Nio García]
Nio!
I gave you trust and you failed me
You made fun of me and you humiliated me
LEJO 'You left and you didn't explain
You saw my movie and you turned
Now want to know what I think about you?
I feel bastard because you are not here
Just as you came you can go (you can go; uh-yeh!)

[Chorus: Nio García]
I'm not going to deny that I suffered, I had a bad time
But I overcame and my life bot, and I bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you
Pa'l fuck I sent you, I sent you
And from my life I took you, I took you
Baby, I bot

[Verse 6: Nicky Jam]
I lie if I say I don't need when your skin touched me
(Touched your skin)
I lie if I say I do not need to call dawn
(At dawn)
Asking me to grip you hard in bed and make my wife
(My wife makes you)
I take advantage of the remix with ozu 'to send you for you too much
(Hell too)

[Bridge: Nicky Jam]
I don't want a lie 'or your falsehood
I'm leaving the street tonight to rumbar
I drink two drinks' and I'm going to forget you
I go with the babys who want to play
I don't want a lie 'or your falsehood
I'm leaving the street tonight to rumbar
I drink two drinks' and I'm going to forget you
I go with the babys who want to play

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Baby, I bot, bot
I gave you a band and I released you, I released you (I released)
Pa'l fuck I sent you, I sent you
And from my life I took you out, I took you out (I took you out)
