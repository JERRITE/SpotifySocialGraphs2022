B11 Lyrics ["B11" ft letter. Myke Towers]

[Intro: Darell, Zion & Darell]
How good you look, baby
Let see what is not seen
You keep looking at me, warming me
Pa 'hit the couple'
I want to give you how e '
How the last sees'

[Chorus: Darell, Zion, Zion & Darell]
You dance that I'm going to look at you (that is like that)
Put on the pose 'that you will give you (to know)
I have the fire to burn you (by law)
Move the body like Beyoncé
Hey, Rvssian! (Ra-ta-ta!)
You dance that I'm going to look at you (that's how, that's, like that; look at you)
Put on the pose 'to give you (that you will give you; by law)
I have the fire to burn you (The Real Rondón; burn)
Move the body like Beyoncé (that is, that's how 'E' like this)
[Verse 1: Darell]
(Everybody Go To The DiscoTak!)
Forever in Play, leaving for Eventay Street (ESO E 'like this)
When I caught you, mommy, I will not give you break (ah)
I want to do it all day (woh-oh)
Only you and I with the film in replay (here we go again!)
You say 'not fall in love'
But calm, I just need 24 hour '(listen)
Where is it'? That I arrive now
And forget what they say, that the good is not erased
Trépeate, mommy, on top
That I want to see you
'Toy like a madman behind you (that is like that)
You killed, he has' to 'lo' ki
With you I'm going to'a
Pa'l fuck the rest in peace
Vo'a give you, as if I wanted, mommy, make sure
Don't worry 'that I don't want to love you
When you want again, I look for you again
That is like this

[Chorus: Zion, Darell, Zion & Darell]
You dance that I'm going to look at you (look at you)
Put on the pose 'to give you (that you will give you; by law)
I have the fire to burn you (The Real Rondón; burn)
Move the body like Beyoncé

Hey
Move the body like Beyoncé
I fall after eleven
Versace of the 'Tenni' to the Boxers
You put in poses
If you want to eat you the closet
Private; I'm going to make you a concert
It is released if I look at her, that on the way the road
If you leave me, I don't finish and I combine you
Lowering the cheese with the wine
Knows that time we did not lose
I always do it as if it were the last sees'
With full pockets I was going to see you
You ere 'a hidden devil, baby
And I apologize from time to time
And I put it to the Revé '
And he let me go by my instinct
Gets carried away
One like you had not seen
And he wants to know the undefeated

[Chorus: Darell, Zion, Zion & Darell]
You dance that I'm going to look at you (that's how, that's, like that; look at you)
Put on the pose 'to give you (that you will give you; by law)
I have the fire to burn you (The Real Rondón; burn)
Move the body like Beyoncé
[Verse 3: Lennox]
(Mamacita; Hey Rvssian!)
Baby (ah), your punani is not easy (no)
Ponte pa 'me, I'm going to me (ah)
I want you to brinques on me-í, mami (plo-aplo-aplo)
Follow you moving for me (so-so)
With you I feel much more feli '(more feli')
All my money is to spend on you (so)
I'm going to live my life to Marc Anthony (EH)

[Bridge: Lennox]
Seeing you dancing already badly (so)
I want to grab your waist and give you (Take, Take)
In the Vamo 'disco to Bellaquear (Plo-Pop
I have what I am looking for to warm you (so, so, so)
Seeing you dancing already badly
I want to grab your waist and give you (Take, Take)
In the Vamo 'disco to Bellaquear (So-SO)
I have what I am looking for to warm you (ah)

[Chorus: Darell, Zion, Zion & Darell]
You dance that I'm going to look at you (that is like that)
Put on the pose 'that you will give you (to know)
I have the fire to burn you (by law)
Move the body like Beyoncé
Zion, baby!
You dance that I'm going to look at you (that's how, that's, like that; look at you)
Put on the pose 'to give you (that you will give you; by law)
I have the fire to burn you (The Real Rondón; burn)
Move the body like Beyoncé
