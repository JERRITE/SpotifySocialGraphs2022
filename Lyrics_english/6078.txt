Lovefool Lyrics[Songtext zu „Lovefool“]

[Intro: Pia Mia & twocolors]
(Love me, love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Fool me, fool me)
(Go on and fool me)

[Verse 1: Pia Mia]
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do
[Pre-Chorus: Pia Mia & twocolors]
So I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to

[Chorus: Pia Mia & twocolors]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, lovе me
Pretend that you lovе me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

[Post-Chorus: Pia Mia & twocolors]
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me

[Verse 2: Pia Mia]
Oh baby, baby
Hearts break so easy
Love me, touch me
Tell me you need me
Hold me, catch me quickly
'Cause I'm falling
Just remind me
Oh, I still reassure
There's an hole that is fine
And if you don't fill me
I'm empty inside
Oh save me, save me
Rescue my heart and soul
And set me free
