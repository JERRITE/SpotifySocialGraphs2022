It is only better lyrics [letter of "is only better"]

[Intro]
Alone is better
Hey
Alone is better
Yandar (it's just better)
And Yostin
From the study

[Pre-car]
My heart is very large and in the fit
Several quereres (several quereres)
That's why I don't commit myself
And I dedicate myself to enjoy the pleasures (the pleasures)
I have had several experiences
With ancient loves (ancient loves)
And as I am intelligent I learned from all those mistakes (errors)
[Chorus]
And that's why I'm alone, because it's only better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always say they love you (they want)
But they always deceive you (they deceive you)
And that's why I'm alone, because it's only better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always say they love you (they want)
But they always deceive you (they deceive you)

[Verse 1]
Unfortunately life has taught me not to believe
In the words that come out of the mouth of a pretty woman
To-to-to-all are the same, they all pay like this
When they see you in love they always make fun of you, eh-ey
Not all are bad, but there are very few good
Good is alien women
The bad walks, the good trapped

[Bridge]
I don't better fall in love because this area is undermined with bad
Bad, very bad women
That damage your heart
That's why I'm alone, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And that's why I'm alone, because it's only better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always say they love you (they want)
But they always deceive you (they deceive you)
And that's why I'm alone, because it's only better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always say they love you (they tell you they love you)
But they always deceive you (but you're alone, ok?)

I gave my heart to a beautiful woman
But he never took advantage, it was very big for her
My heart no longer owns

[Bridge]
I don't better fall in love because this area is undermined with bad
Bad, very bad women
That damage your heart
That's why I'm alone

[Pre-car]
I have had several experiences
With ancient loves (ancient loves)
And as I am intelligent I learned from all those mistakes (errors)

[Chorus]
And that's why I'm alone, because it's only better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always say they love you (they want)
But they always deceive you (they deceive you)
