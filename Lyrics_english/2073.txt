Paper Hearts Lyrics[Intro]
Goodbye love
You flew right by love

[Verse 1]
Remember the way you made me feel
Such young love but something in me knew that it was real
Frozen in my head

[Chorus]
Pictures I'm living through for now
Trying to remember all the good times
Our life was cutting through so loud
Memories are playing in my dull mind
I hate this part, paper hearts
And I'll hold a piece of yours
Don't think I would just forget about it
Hoping that you won't forget about it
[Verse 2]
Everything is gray under these skies, wet mascara
Hiding every cloud under a smile, when there's cameras
And I just can't reach out to tell you
That I always wonder what you're up to

[Chorus]
Pictures I'm living through for now
Trying to remember all the good times
Our life was cutting through so loud
Memories are playing in my dull mind
I hate this part paper hearts
And I'll hold a piece of yours
Don't think I would just forget about it
Hoping that you won't forget

[Hook]
I live through pictures as if I was right there by your side
But you'll be good without me and if I could just give it some time
I'll be alright
Goodbye love
You flew right by love

[Chorus]
Pictures I'm living through for now
Trying to remember all the good times
Our life was cutting through so loud
Memories are playing in my dull mind
I hate this part paper hearts
And I'll hold a piece of yours
Don't think I would just forget about it
Hoping that you won't forgetYou might also like35Embed
