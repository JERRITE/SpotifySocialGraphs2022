Let It All Go, Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good mornin' everyone, gather 'round, grab a chair
Make yourself a drink, blow your smoke into the air
Contemporary sadness and fire-breathin' dragons are everywhere
But the days go by here in old Belvedere
And the way that it goes is just the way that it is
But do you ever wonder if anyone is ever gonna make it out?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is it wonder? Is it fame?
Or is it popularity that ruins everything?
It's the river, not the rain
Why is everyone pretendin' that there's not a drop to drink?
There you are holdin' on to everything
[Chorus]
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go

[Verse 2]
So I build up a fence around the man in me
As the Mayan and the misanthrope argue in the street
Angelic eyes of sadness and fire-breathin' dragons are all I see
But the longer I stand and the more I awake
The cracks in my hand and the lines on my face
Fail to remind me the frail and the blind see the same as me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is it madness or is it fear?
My brother, I'm not really sure after all these years
Is it wonder? Is it love?
Or is everyone believin' that it's under their control?
Here we are, just waitin' to explode

[Chorus]
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is it madness or is it fear?
My brother, I'm not really sure after all these years
Is it wonder? Is it love?
Or is everyone believin' that it's under their control?
Here we are, just waitin' to explode

[Chorus]
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Let it all go
Just let it all go, man
Let it all go, man
Just let it all go, man
Let it all go1Embed
