The echo of your voice Lyricsvuelve the time he left 
 Your memory in my song 
 Live on the limit 
 The echo of your voice 

 And I feel you like something impossible 
 I remember that... 

 [Chorus] 
 I promised to return 
 Every warm day slides 
 To bring your liquid memory 
 Hugs my skin 
 In the days like today 
 Between the sea and the heart 
 Live on the limit 
 The echo of your voice 

 And I feel you like something impossible 
 I remember that... 

 I promised to return 
 Every warm day slides 
 To bring your liquid memory 
 That hugs me to return 
 Every warm day slides 
 To bring your liquid memory 
 That hugs me to return 
 Every warm day slides 
 To bring your liquid memory 
 Hugs my skinyou might Also likembed
