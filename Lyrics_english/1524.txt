It's PRETTYMUCH

[Chorus: Nick Mara & Haechan]
Leave it up to you, baby (Baby)
If you wanna spend the night, when the time is right
Leave it up to you, baby
Whenever you’re comfortable, we can make that move
Leave it up to you

[Verse 1: Zion Kuwonu]
Nobody watching, now I got you all alone, no interruptions (Yeah)
It's hard for me to hold my own and hold back
No cap, no cap
Before we do some things, we 'bout to both regret, let’s intermission (Yeah)
I should drive you home, darling, ASAP
No cap, no cap (Shee!)
[Pre-Chorus: Edwin Honoret]
Before we hit the road, if you ain't ready to go (Yeah)
Oh, just tell me that you're sure, you're sure (Sure)
'Cause I really want you to stay, but this ain't up to me
Oh, I just wanna make sure you're sure (Hey)

[Chorus: Nick Mara & Haechan]
Leave it up to you, baby (Baby)
If you wanna spend the night, when the time is right
Leave it up to you, baby
Whenever you're comfortable, we can make that move
Leave it up to you
[Verse 2: Haechan, Chenle  & Renjun]
원하면 말해 기다려 줄게
너와 내 사이 거리 이 정도면 어때
Yeah, 우린 서서히 서로를 끌어 당기지
난 네게 맞춰 갈게 걱정할 것 없어

[Pre-Chorus: Jisung & Chenle]
Before we hit the road, if you ain’t ready to go

’Cause I really want you to stay but this ain't up to me (Oh)
Oh, I just wanna make sure you're sure
