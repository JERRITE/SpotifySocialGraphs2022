Money Buy Drugs (Interlude) Lyrics[Intro]
I hate the internet
Me too

[Chorus]
Got a new plug, my other guy sucks
Barely got a buzz off 25 bucks
Dropped 200, I got too much
And I got too fried I'm sunny side up
Got your dad doin' blow off my ass
Got your mom tryn' suck on my nuts
Don't tell me money don't buy happiness when it so happen that money buy drugs
[Verse 1]
Therefore by the transitive property (Shh)
When I'm fucked up don't talk to me
I feel like it's a bunch of lil bugs on top of me
Help me, I can't get 'em off of me
I can't move I'm stuck in a sofa
Then stuck in a room where the walls get closer
Next time your try fuckin' me over I'll put you in a bath with a plugged in toaster
It's too late no one can stop me "Hey Siri"
How do you get rid of a body?
Chop it up, do a little bit of Karate
I'm doin' 90 and it sittin in the bag ridin' shotty

[Pre-Chorus]
Such a good boy when I was 18
But I smoked alcohol and drank weed
And now my brain turned into baked beans
Don't be like me, kids I'm fried
(Fried, fried, fried, fried)

[Chorus]
Got a new plug, my other guy sucks
Barely got a buzz off 25 bucks
Dropped 200, I got too much
And I got too fried I'm sunny side up
Got your dad doin' blow off my ass
Got your mom tryn' suck on my nuts
Don't tell me money don't buy happiness when it so happen that money buy drugs
You might also like[Verse 2]
I feel obligated to say this
Kids don't do drugs, drugs are dangerous
The brain can change in ways I can't explain
But it feel like I'm stuck in a simulation
Two sedatives for the euthanasia
The voice in my head got too persuasive
The flu contagious, everybody dead except a couple rich white dudes in spaceships
Ding, ding, time is up, the world is ending, the climate sucks
I'm high and drunk, drivin' a Cybertruck
The AI talkin' to me like it's tryna fuck (Fuck me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Such a good boy when I was 18
But I smoked alcohol and drank weed
And now my brain turned into baked beans
Don't be like me, kids I'm fried
(Fried, fried, fried, fried)

[Chorus]
Got a new plug, my other guy sucks
Barely got a buzz off 25 bucks
Dropped 200, I got too much
And I got too fried I'm sunny side up
Got your dad doin' blow off my ass
Got your mom tryn' suck on my nuts
Don't tell me money don't buy happiness when it so happen that money buy drugsEmbed
