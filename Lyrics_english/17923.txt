Lyricsno is not enough for me neither the light nor the morning 
 Neither the Rocio, nor the relay, nor the frost 
 Not a little sun 
 It is not enough for me to see blue sunsets 
 Nor Camilleo de la Mar 
 Nor the caleshs that hang from his voice 
 Nor that on the air is mixed every night 
 A bit of your smell 
 Nor that white condemned to abandonment 

 In your eternal is where I want to see myself 
 And get entangled with your essence 
 And to the infinite nail his teeth 
 And get away from your absence 
 The night is not enough for me in your gaze 
 Nor that your words are confused with kisses 
 Nor that you change your opinion 
 Neither your kisses nor your frictions are enough for me 
 Not even the one who hugs him when you cry 
 Nor the bankruptcies of your love 
 Nor that on the air is mixed a little of your smell 
 Nor that drowning with your dark transparent 
 Every effort, every light and every source 
 That feeds your Poloyou Might Also Likeembed
