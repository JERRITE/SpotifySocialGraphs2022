Tell them Lyrics ["Dile" letter]

[Intro]
Bad Bunny, Baby
(Turn on another Phillie, baby)

[Pre-car]
Turn on another phillie, baby (Yeh)
That this now goes out
Let's go for the fourth dust, this is a saga
He says he likes to do it with my trap songs
And if they ask you why sex I am your fav
[Chorus]
Tell them that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you
That I do everything you need to make you come
And tell (tell them), that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you
That I do everything you need to make you come

[Verse 1]
Vamo 'to do it inside the car and pichea the hotel (hotel)
I want, baby, and there is no time to lose
Crystallic 'tintia'o, nobody will see us
Estamo 'Bellaco' and Queremo 'put (wuh)
You and I alone, give it, turn off the cel '
That you will do what he does not do to you
And woh, heh
The Crystallic 'of the car fog
Your angel face deceives me
I am healthy, but you damage me
And woh (woh)
Set a krippy and put on lucí'a
He gave me a blowjob while driving
He climbed and seduced me
Tell these fools' that do not compare
If they are Lexus, I am a McLaren (Wuh)
Always from Pole Ralph Lauren
With drops for the eyes clarify
The air turns on and at least hot (it's hot)
If they ask you why, that I fuck you better, baby
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Tell them that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you
That I do everything you need to make you come
And tell them that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you (ah)
That I do everything you need to make you come

[Verse 2]
You and I do it.
Give him, baby, take off the mahón, Yeh
That I already threw out the armchair
Vamo 'to do it in the capsulon
It transforms when she sees smoke (she sees smoke)
It tells me that as I do not there (Wuh)
He never wants this to end
But I later 'two hour' ask that if I already came
We do to ', you never limit yourself
You put it yourself, it facilitates it '
I love it when I rise and shout me
I love that it lasts ', you never take away from me'
Hot Pants of Victoria's, with me 'it opens'
Kiss', bite ', obscene words'
She is not porn actress
But with me makes a scene '
She smokes and chinga from the high
Always jangling hidden from pa'i
He has a mahón that is not his size
And I crazy to make a creampie
Everyone throws him, but always in vain
Everyone throws him, but I am always the one who won him
[Chorus]
Tell them that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you
That I do everything you need to make you come
And tell (tell them), that I know your favorite 'pose'
That I speak badly and that excites you (ah)
That I do everything you need to make you come

[Outro]
