Let me know Lyrics [letter of "Let me know"]

[Intro]
WOH-OH-OH-OH, YEH-EH-EH-EH
WOH-OH-OH-OH, YEH-EH-EH-EH

[Chorus]
Girl (girl), let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
Tell me at once (once)
Although it hurts, I want to know, girl (knowledge, girl)
Let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
To know if I'm going away from here
You will not know about me, Girl (Girl)
[Verse 1]
And tell what happened
If you already forgot everything we and I
If I of course I left you
Nothing will happen, don't miss this, no
And I know they have told you that I have been
They are only rumors, nothing has happened here
Tell me if I leave, tell me if I stay
You blame me and with the position of conscience I stay (I stay)

[Pre-car]
And now you have me here, baby (-'qui, baby)
In Limbo for you, Yeh-Yeh (Yeh-Yeh)
And now you have me here
Breaking my head for thinking about you

[Chorus]
Girl, let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
Tell me at once (once)
Although it hurts, I want to know, girl (knowledge, girl)
Let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
To know if I'm going away from here
You will not know about me, Girl (Girl)

If you already know (you already know), I know too (I know too)
We both want and it is not fair (OH-OH-OH)
That everything ends and do not let me know (OH-OH-OH)
Tell me why, if not, I look for me (OH-OH)
What are you leaving for if you know it will soon return?
I know you'll call wanting it to do it again
One day you left and the other you came back
But I still remember the day when you tried me, Yeh (EH-EH)

[Pre-car]
And now you have me here, baby (-quí, baby)
In Limbo for you, Yeh-Yeh (Yeh-Yeh)
And now you have me here
Breaking my head for thinking about you

[Chorus]
Girl, let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
Tell me at once (once)
Although it hurts, I want to know, girl (knowledge, girl)
Let me know if you love me '(wants')
Or if you still miss me '(-traña')
To know if I'm going away from here
You will not know about me, Girl (Girl)
