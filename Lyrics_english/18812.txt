Ghosts Along the Mississippi Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the morning
It takes me quite a while to clear my head
And as the day moves on
I find it hard to smile at something said
So I took control
Priority number one, and that's me
Then I cut the dragon's head off
And put away my gun, so let it be
So let be
[Chorus]
I'm dying (I'm dying) prematurely
I'm wasting (I'm wasting) my life for sure
I'm trying (I'm trying) to kill what's happening to me
A ghost along the Mississippi

[Verse 2]
Never thought before
How life could be so strange
And I guess my one a day became ten or twelve or more
And more and more and more
But I've got a gift
It's something called my friends or love
With them and I combined I'll beat an early end
It's been done before
It's been done before

[Chorus]
No timing (No timing) of passing away
Of losing (Of losing) just one more day
I'm vying (I'm vying) to kill what's wrong with me, yes I am
A ghost along the Mississippi

[Bridge]
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me no, won't do it to me no, oh no
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me
Can't happen to me, can't happen to me
Won't do it to me, won't do it to me, won't do it to me, oh no
Let's go

Destroying
What's got hold of me
No more a ghost of MississippiEmbed
