Shook Ones freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Aye
Yo
Aye

Let's get it
Shook, shook ones

[Verse 1]
I'm a muthaphuckkin' playa
Not a hater, stranger
Better look out cuz' I'm 'boutta slay a
Beat and make a hit
Heat or the fire that made this heatwave
My people brave, your people slaves
My people eat, your people sleep
Rest in peace to Prodigy, a real fuckin' G
Shoutout all the legends, i'mma make you proud, G
Unit, shoutout to 50, a living legend
Representin' till the present, get it?
At the age of 16 I got 21 questions
Shoutout to my best friend baby sister
At the age of 14 I got 2 friend lesbians
Shoutout to my best friend's babysitter
A playa was shy so I didn't make it
But if I wasn't, all them chicks would already pay me, yo
One of them fingered and one of them pregnant
If I wasn't real enough then I would be shakin', yo
Ass on my dick
Real shit
Make a hit
This flow be annoying
But that's the shit y'all be enjoying now, yo, aye
21st question - what the fuck is going on?
80th section - shoutout Lamar, shoutout Kendrick, yo
[Bridge]
Aye, lemme do a chorus now, yo

Yo, yo, aye, yo

[Chorus]
I'm a real g, real g
