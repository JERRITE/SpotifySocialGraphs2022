The house of the rising sun Lyrics [letter of "the house of the rising sun"] 

 [Chorus: Álex de Lucas, Amaia, both] 
 Where the day is born 
 Where the sun is born 
 Is our little house 
 Where one day I was looking for your love 

 [Verse 1: Amaia, both] 
 Why does the memory pursue me? 
 Why can't I forget? 
 Why that helplessness? 
 Why this loneliness? 
 [Verse 2: Amaia & Álex de Lucas] 
 Why did you leave me just? 
 Where did you have to go? 
 How has life gone? 
 Life so far from me 

 [Instrumental] 

 [Verse 3: both, Amaia] 
 Fate played his game 
 The game that I did not choose 
 Your absence was so long that one day 
 Up
