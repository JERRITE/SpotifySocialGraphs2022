Call You Up Lyrics(verse 1)
I try to hide that I need you like I
Need the sky to light up at night
So I can see where I'm going
When I'm walking to you
But I made the mistake of giving away that I
Wanna call at the end of the day
And talk about plans wasting away with you
And that you seem to be the air that I breathe
And the last thing I think of as I fall asleep
But recently I've started to feel like I'll be
Slipping away at the end of the day
Into dreams of the two of us running away
It's okay, I'll just say I was drunk yesterday
And just hope that you still wanna stay
(chorus)
And I'll call you up in the middle of the night
In hopes that you wanna hear from me
I just wanna know if you're feeling alright
I just wanna know if you got in a fight with your friends
And I know we'll have to pretend that we're fine for a night
But then again I know you know we'll be alright in the end

(verse 2)
Yeah I try to hide that I need you like I
Need to sleep for once in my life
Oh, I've tried and I've tried but you keep occupying my mind
And I would say that you light a light in the room
Cause I need you to do all the things that I do
Can you be true?
You're making me lose my head

(chorus)
And I'll call you up in the middle of the night
In hopes that you wanna hear from me
I just wanna know if you're feeling alright
I just wanna know if you got in a fight with your friends
And I know we'll have to pretend that we're fine for a night
But then again I know you know we'll be alright in the end

(chorus/breakdown)
And I'll call you up in the middle of the night
In hopes that you wanna hear from me
I just wanna know if you're feeling alright
I just wanna know if you got in a fight with your friends
And I know we'll have to pretend that we're fine for a night
But then again I know you know we'll be alright in the end

Said I call you up

I'd called you up if I thought you would like it

Yeah I call you up

I call you up
I'd call you up if I thought you would like it

Yeah I call you up

I'd call you up if I thought you would like it

Said I call you up
I call you up
I call you up
I call you up
I'd call you up if I thought you would like it4Embed
