I look for you lyrics ["I look for you" ft. Alex Rose]

[Intro: Alex Rose, Sech, Alex Rose & Sech]
(YEH-YEH, YEH-YEH, YEH-YEH, EH, EH-EH)
Mommy, leave the fool that (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
That your body does not deserve (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
From pills I have a pot, let's travel with Popper
Scale even if they notice

[Pre-car: sech]
You just say yes
I vo 'to leave as Argentina, without Messi
No one changes Coca-Cola for Pepsi
That idiot did not pass the thesis
[Chorus: Sech, Alex Rose]
VECE ', he says no, but he liked him (-r he liked it)
Who has time with him and just met
Who does not know what what, but he liked (but he liked it)
E 'I have a Flow bastard when I look for it (Yeh-eh)
But he liked (Yeh)
Who has time with him and just met
Who does not know what what, but he liked (but he liked it)
E 'I have a Flow bastard when I look for it (Yeh-eh; Yeh)

[Verse 1: Alex Rose]
She says that she likes my swagg bastard (HMM)
That when he saw me, he was fast hypnotized '
I got flirty and threw a couple of wink '
I did not miss the respect but I put it wet
She does not smoke or baby, very rich it smells
Chiquita, Long Hair, Model 'E TV
And although I celebrate it, then, you should not
Sexflix is ​​heard in his bed whenever it rains (Yeh)

[Bridge: Alex Rose]
For not feeling bad (bad)
He put another name on his cell phone (EH)
Because he knows that I will call him (eh)
But he who sleeps the way to look for (Yeh-eh)
