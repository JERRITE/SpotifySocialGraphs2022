Pamela Lyrics [Intro]
Let's play
One, who bet
Two, you join
Three, four
Pamela One, Pamela-Mela One
Pamela Two, Pamela-Mela Two
Pamela Three, Pamela-Mela Three
Pamela Four, Pamela-Mela Four

[Hook]
Pamela One, move the body
PAMELA TWO, SUPPORT THAT
Pamela Three, as if tickling
Pamela Four, F4
[CHORUS]
Dance, stir like melting
Grind, request as if
Don't just hurt your head

[Hook]
Pamela One, move the body
PAMELA TWO, SUPPORT THAT
Pamela Three, as if tickling
Pamela Four, F4

[CHORUS]
Dance, stir like melting
Grind, request as if
Don't just hurt your head

[Post-Chorus]
It's for the child, as well as fatty
Also for the elderly 'non -nirahamoma
Easy to mimic, you will not sleep
Try it and let it go
