Raging on a Sunday Lyrics[Intro]
And the hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by
The Spirit of the Lord to the middle of a valley full of bones
Full of bones

[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Save me from myself and take me to the promised land)
[Verse 1]
This is a chapel and these words, your religion
Raise your cup for that holy grail that you're sippin'
Free up your mind, I know that it can be a prison
We ain't got much time, you better spend what you were given

[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Save me from myself and take me to the promised land)
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptized in the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday)

[Verse 2]
This is a holiday and you've been resurrected
Rise from the grave when everyone least expects it
We are the ones that thrive off being rejected
Hiding the bones and never learning our lesson

[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a- Oh, my God!)
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' in the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday)

[Bridge]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
(I'm ragin' on a Sunday)
Lot to confess and I'll worry 'bout that some day
(Worry 'bout that some day)
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Lookin' pretty thirsty)
Yeah, I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
(Raging, raging, raging on a Sunday)

[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Save me from myself and take me to the promised land)
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
(Hey-ay, Hey-ay)
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a, blaaa!)11Embed
