Girl Are You Lonely Like Me? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something changed and I can't explain
But I feel it deep down in my veins
Gotta move out, move on, it's gone
Before you know it you're alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Just got to let it go
Nothing's gonna change it all
Everything I know
Always want a little more, ah yeah
[Chorus]
Then your world crashes down
Like a ten tonne weight at the foot of your bed
Singing what do I do now?
'Cause you know deep down
He ain't the one you need
Girl are you lonely like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Lonely like me

[Verse 2]
Trying to fill the hole that you left with
Anybody that can put up with me
Go up to my room in the darkness
Sink back to the same old feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Got to let it go
Nothing's gonna change it all
Everything I know
Always want a little more, ah yeah

[Chorus]
Then your world crashes down
Like a ten tonne weight at the foot of your bed
Singing what do I do now?
'Cause you know deep down
He ain't the one you need
Girl are you lonely like me?
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Lonely like me

[Bridge]
'Cause if you've had enough of talking
And you want to waste some time, call on me
'Cause you know deep down
He ain't the one you need

[Chorus]
Then your world crashes down
Like a ten tonne weight at the foot of your bed
Singing what do I do now?
'Cause you know deep down
He ain't the one you need
Girl are you lonely like me?

[Outro]
