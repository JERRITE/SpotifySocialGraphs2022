Dermot (See Yourself In My Eyes) LyricsBut if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
Now these songs will hold and hide your name
You'd see you shine, you shine
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes

And if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine

I was lost
About you, about you, all about you
About you, about you, all about you
About you, about you, all about you
About you, about you
See you shine, you shine
I will hold you 'til I hold you right
And if only you could see yourself in my eyes

About you, about you, all about you
About you, about you, all about you
All it was was all about you, about you
All it was was all about you
See you shine, you shine

Fall in love with someone that enjoys your, um, weirdness
Not someone that, um, tries to talk you into being normal

And if only you could see yourself in my eyes
And if only you could see yourself in my eyes
I will hold you 'til I hold you right
And if only you could see yoursеlf in my eyes

About you, about you, all about you
About you, about you, all about you
All it was was all about you, about you
About you, about you
You'd see you shine, you shinе

Fall in love with someone that enjoys your, um, weirdness
Not someone that, um, tries to talk you into being normalYou might also likeEmbed
