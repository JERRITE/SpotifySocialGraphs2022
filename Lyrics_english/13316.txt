Whatâ€™s It Gonna Be? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do I tell you I love you or not?
'Cause I can't really guess what you want
If you let me down, let me down slow
If you let me down, let me down slow
If you got feelings for me
You just gotta speak honestly
If you let me down, let me down slow
If you let me down, let me down slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own
You're at the beach
Hundreds of miles away
I don't wanna be that girl
I don't wanna be that girl
[Chorus]
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna let you love somebody else but me
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna make it out like it's no big deal
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?

[Verse 2]
I'm praying but don't see the signs
I've been praying for you to be mine
If you let me down, let me down slow
If you let me down, let me down slow
I don't believe in forever
But I still wanna give it try
If you let me down, let me down slow
If you let me down, let me down slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own
You're at the beach
Hundreds of miles away
I don't wanna be that girl
I don't wanna be that girl
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna let you love somebody else but me
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna make it out like it's no big deal
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?

[Bridge]
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
What it's gonna
What it's gonna be?
[Chorus]
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna let you love somebody else but me
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna make it out like it's no big deal
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be?
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna let you love somebody else but me
So what's it gonna be?
(What it's gonna)
So what's it gonna be?
I don't wanna give you up
I don't wanna make it out like it's no big deal
So what's it gonna be?
(What it's gonna)
So what's it gonna be?9Embed
