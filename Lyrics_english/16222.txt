​what’s the matter with you Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look away
I try to bite my tongue
I think you might be givin' me the feelin' I've been runnin' from
A mistake
I know how this one ends
'Cause once you say it, there's no goin' back to bein' friends

[Pre-Chorus]
When you caress my face and kiss my waist
It's so underrated
Pins and needles in my arms 'til you touch me
Now I can feel again
[Chorus]
What's the matter with you?
You're such a gentlemen
I told you I don't have the time to fall in love again
What's the matter with you?
Why'd you take my hand?
I love the way you came around and ruined all my plans

[Post-Chorus]
What's the matter with you, hm-mm

[Verse 2]
Go away
You can read my thoughts
I can see it in your еyes in the driveway whеn you drop me off

[Pre-Chorus]
When you caress my face and grab my waist
It's so complicated
When we saw the shootin' star and you kissed me
We weren't bein' friends

[Chorus]
What's the matter with you?
You're such a gentlemen
I told you I don't have the time to fall in love again
What's the matter with you?
Why'd you take my hand?
I love the way you came around and ruined all my plans
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
What's the matter with you, you?
Matter with you, you
Matter with you, you
What's the matter with you?

[Chorus]
What's the matter with you?
You're such a gentlemen
I told you I don't have the time to fall in love again
What's the matter with you?
Why'd you take my hand?
I love the way you came around and ruined all my plans

[Post-Chorus]
What's the matter with you, you?
Matter with you, you
Matter with you, you
What's the matter with you?2Embed
