Chasing Rubies Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take me away to someplace else
Cause I don’t wanna see you, with anybody else
And maybe I’m selfish, I don’t know
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go

[Chorus]
This is not deja vu
I’ve never met somebody like you
I’d like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go
[Verse 2]
Chasing rubies, chasing gold
I’d like to tell you, before you’re told
Maybe I’m crazy, you’ll think so
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go

[Chorus]
This is not deja vu
I’ve never met somebody like you
I’d like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go

[Verse 3]
What if you don’t like me
What if I’m being naive
Maybe it’s love, sure I don’t know
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go

[Chorus]
This is not deja vu
I’ve never met somebody like you
I’d like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go
You might also likeAnd don’t wanna let you go (x8)

This is not deja vu
I’ve never met somebody like you
I’d like to tell you the truth
I hardly know you and I don’t wanna let you go
And I don’t wanna let you go
This is not deja vu2Embed
