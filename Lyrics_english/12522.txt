Brazilian Soul (Acoustic Bossa Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The praia in the sun
The forró in the night
Garota brasileira dancing into the daylight
De swing e rebolado
Don't know how but I try to
Seu jeitinho
Your carinho's something that I'd fly to

[Pre-Chorus]
Quer saber de onde sou?
Brasileira, meu amor
Brasil!
Quer saber de onde sou?
Brasileira, meu amor
Brasil!
[Chorus]
My tambourine in the rhythm of samba
In the heat of December
Oh, Brazil is where I'll go
I think I've got a case of Brazilian soul
I'll always remember
Oh, in the heat of December
When we let our hearts grow close

[Bridge]
The swing and the samba
Todo mundo bamba
The alma brasileira
Drinking coffee with the capoeira
From New York to Pará
Atlanta to Paraná
São Paulo, Tocantins
Miami and the in between

[Pre-Chorus]
Quer saber de onde sou?
Brasileira, meu amor
Brasil!
Quer saber de onde sou?
Brasileira, meu amor
Brasil!

My tambourine in the rhythm of samba
In the heat of December
Oh, Brazil is where I'll go
I think I've got a case of Brazilian soul
I'll always remember
Oh, in the heat of December
When we let our hearts grow close

My tambourine in the rhythm of samba
In the heat of December
Oh, Brazil is where I'll go
I think I've got a case of Brazilian soul
I'll always remember
Oh, in the heat of December
When we let our hearts grow closeEmbed
