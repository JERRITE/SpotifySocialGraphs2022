Angels On My Side Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Dark times and loneliness
It took awhile to feel like me
'Til I found my soul and I stood on my own
I said fuck that, no, it won't trap me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go down the road that I've been before
I wanna go see the world, where I've never been before
I wanna see all these people that I've never met before
I wanna go give you everything and everything and more
I'm like oh, you're not alone, 'cause at times I feel like
I can't control over someone mind and I just see the light
I feel like I got angels on my side, but then I just feel insane
'Cause all the hunger and the pain of the change
But, I'm thankful for my ups and my downs
I'm about to turn that shit straight up now
You can trust that
[Pre-Chorus]
Dark times and loneliness
It took awhile to feel like me
'Til I found my soul and I stood on my own
I said fuck that, no, it won't trap me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go down the road that I've been before
I wanna go see the world, where I've never been before
I wanna see all these people that I've never met before
I wanna go give you everything and everything and more
I'm like oh, you're not alone, 'cause at times I feel like
I can't control over someone mind and I just see the light
I feel like I got angels on my side, but then I just feel insane
'Cause all the hunger and the pain of the change
But, I'm thankful for my ups and my downs
I'm about to turn that shit straight up now
You can trust that

[Outro]
Dark times and loneliness
