Let Me In Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say, "Come over," but you won't let me in, in
You don't talk to me, you're too busy living in your head, head, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know if it's worth it
I'm walking on air
Barely scratching the surface
It's like you're not here
Say it ain't on purpose
Admit that you're scared
It ain't fair, ooh
[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe
Let, let, let (let me in)
Let, let (let me in)

[Verse 2]
Say you're misunderstood, you claim nobody cares, cares
I can't tell if you just save your mind for someone else, else

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know if it's worth it
I'm walking on air
Barely scratching the surface
It's like you're not here
Say it ain't on purpose
Admit that you're scared
I wanna be there, ooh

[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe
Let, let, let (let me in)
Let, let (let me in)
(Let me in, yeah)

Aw yeah (let me in, let me in)
You puttin' up a wall
You ain't pick up my call
I'll still be there regardless (I'll still be there, yeah)
No, I don't understand
You never let me in
I know you ain't heartless (ooh)
If it's mine, if it's mine
I'm getting impatient 'cause I've been giving it time, baby
I've been giving it time
So let me in

[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe
Let, let, let (let me in)
Let, let (let me in)

[Outro]
