ICU Lyrics[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, please, please, remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, please, please, remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de

[Verse 1: Cakes da Killa]
Yo, peep the design, Chanel Number Five
Got my chakras realigned, [?][0:31] on the spine
Feeling sober kind, I fill cups up with wine
Love [?] number nine
Running laps through my mind-mind-mind
Oh me, oh my
Tongues fully tied, no need for replies
Hands around my waist as I tick and I grind
Ma-ma-say, ma-ma-sah, ma-ma-coo-sah
Ex talking slick, no better than a try
Imitating mines, that's career suicide
Look me in my eyes, I'm the real, fuck that fake shit
Gotta warm it up if you really tryna taste it
Gotta hit the spot when you really tryna break shit
Apeshit, strip me down bare to the basics
Ain't no need to start if you ain't looking for no problems
Quick to pop shit and, yes, I solve 'em
[Chorus: Cakes da Killa, Nomi Ruiz]
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, please, please, remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de

[Verse 2: Cakes da Killa]
Coming down from above, bath bombs in the tub
Ate a full plate and it's still not enough
Had to get seconds 'cause I'm like, "You the one"
Single life really gone like the fat lady song
You know me, this a bad bitch pedigree
Cross me once and it's over like you dead to me
I gave it up, main course with the recipes
Keep it low-key, fans thirsting from my energy
Freak me, then leave me, you never could
Coming in cling like I'm spitting it for Westwood
Head up on my flight overseas wrapped in Westwood
Never had the time to be thinking what the rest would
On the beat, but let's not OD
I see a lot of bobbleheads tryna shake like me
You see, ain't no need to front, if I got it, then I got it
Had it from the womb, now I'm chilling in my pocket

[Chorus: Cakes da Killa, Nomi Ruiz]
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, please, please, remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de
You might also like[Verse 3: Nomi Ruiz]
Do you see what I see? In you, in me
I will love you now matter what the world believes, you see
I was taught that in life one must give to receive, you see
I was blind, but now love has fallen over me, I see, I see

[Chorus: Cakes da Killa, Nomi Ruiz]
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there— stand there— you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body— body— remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there— stand there— you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, please, please, remind me to breathe
Ooh, baby, don't you just stand there, I know you like what you see
Paws pressed all over my body, de-de-de de-de-de-de-de
