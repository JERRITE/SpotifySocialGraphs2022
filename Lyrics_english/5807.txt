We’re on Our Way Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember what might have been
Had to walked you home, I said I'll see you later
You were living the dream
But when the morning come you'd gone meet your maker

[Pre-Chorus]
Good luck in the afterlife
I hear the morning sun doesn't cast no shadow
You chose to drift away, but look at you now
[Chorus]
We're on our way now, the truth can be so hard to swallow
Hey now, 'cause you've got the love, you've got the love lady
I'm worn out 'cause with every little trick they try to drag you down
You don't know why

[Verse 2]
Stood on top of the world
And when thе cold wind blow you said thе chill don't matter
Having the time of your lifе
But whеn you take those pills - does it make it better?

[Pre-Chorus]
Good luck in the afterlife
I hear the morning sun doesn't cast no shadow
You chose to drift away but look at you now

[Chorus]
We're on our way now, the truth can be so hard to swallow
Hey now, 'cause you've got the love, you've got the love lady
I'm worn out 'cause with every little trick they try to drag you down
You don't know why

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
We're on our way now, the truth can be so hard to swallow
Hey now, 'cause you've got the love, you've got the love lady
I'm worn out 'cause with every little trick they try to drag you down
You don't know why

'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love lady
You've got the love, you've got the love lady2Embed
