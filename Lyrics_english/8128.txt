Broken In All The Right Places Lyrics[Intro]
Don't tell me that this has to end
We've always hung on by a thread
Whatever is ripped we'll tape it
Cause we're broken in all the right places

[Verse 1]
And I don't really feel like fighting
And I don't wanna argue then turn out the light
I'm tired of waking up
I'm still like this all the time
[Refrain]
Cause when we get close we just drift apart
Tear another stitch paint another scar
I know you've always been like a work of art
And I wouldn't change it or go back to the start

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay here in my arms until we cry
Lеt's try and forget who's in the right
Our story started with goodbyе
Always loved as if it's do or die

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this has to end
We've always hung on by a thread
Whatever is ripped we'll tape it
Cause we're broken in all the right places

[Post-Chorus]
Cause we're broken in all the right places

[Verse 2]
And I'm not gonna wave no white flag
And I'm not gonna trade you for somebody else
I hate the way you look at me like that
All the time

Cause when we get close we just drift apart
Tear another stitch paint another scar
I know you've always been like a work of art
And I wouldn't change it or go back to the start

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay here in my arms until we cry
Let's try and forget who's in the right
Our story started with goodbye
Always loved as if it's do or die

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this has to end
We've always hung on by a thread
Whatever is ripped we'll tape it
Cause we're broken in all the right places

[Bridge]
We're broken in all the right places
Cause we're broken in all the right places
And we're broken, yeah
We're broken in all the right places
We're broken2Embed
