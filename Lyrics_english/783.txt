Lyrics strawberry ["Strawberry" ft letter. Lalo Ebratt]

[Verse 1: Tini, Lalo Ebratt]
I have in my eyes
That in the dark you can only see (that's right)
Don't ask anything
You already know what we are going to do (All Right)
And now that we are alone
I don't care about the day or time
So much desire are not controlled
I just want to come back
[Pre-car: tini]
And if you tell me "Dance with me"
I will dance with you
And if you follow me, I follow you
Wherever you want to take me
So secret, give me your kisses
Don't think about it, Kiss me
And if you tell me "Dance with me"
I will dance (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

[Chorus: Tini, Lalo Ebratt]
When you touch me ', touch', touch ', touch'
How it causes me ', voca', voca ', voca'
When you kiss me ', from head to toe
I know you like my strawberry lips
When you touch me ', touch', touch ', touch'
The baby causes me ', voca', voca ', voca'
When you kisses me, 'the head is damaged (hey)
Is that I like your strawberry lips (the police 'the flow, yah)

[Verse 2: Lalo Ebratt]
And if I tell you, come, dance, turn off your phone
YOUR POINT COM, as in the room
Dancing reggaeton (that's right)
I have a rocket in the pants
(How? How so? How?)
Hey, the baby is strawberry and has the recipe (Yah)
Mu-very brightness' in the disco
I wet his lips because he was dry (Yeh)
Vamo 'to enjoy the moment, to look like a party
What a nice 'movement', ma, how pretty you are (that's right)
They are your lips as strawberry and cookie ice cream '(All right)
You are a cotton of sugar, you are Alpha and Beta
Like Bulma and Vegeta
