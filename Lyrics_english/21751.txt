Sunsets for Somebody Else Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else
You find yourself asking yourself
"What is any of it worth?"
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth

[Chorus]
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth, did they need a little something more
Than this?
[Verse 2]
The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost
The smell of rain when it’s on the wind
Will never be paid in full
You try in vain to account for this mess
And everything that you stole

[Chorus]
Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth, did they need a little something more
Than this?

[Verse 3]
'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running from this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face
I see you looking just out of frame
What is it pulling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth, they need a little something now

[Outro]
Every time you think, well, they’d be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you want more
Than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere1Embed
