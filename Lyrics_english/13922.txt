If You Ever Leave, I’m Coming With You Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm forever locking myself in the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends with the friends you're close to
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you

[Verse 1]
You know I'll do whatever you want me to
Throw a banquet in a moshpit
I'll get out of bed, stop listening to Radiohead
Take you out of this, your reluctant optimist
[Chorus]
And if you ever leave, I'm coming with you
Stuck to the gum that's stuck on your shoe
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you
I'm forever locking myself in the glass of your rearview
Trying to makе friends with the friends you'rе close to
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you

[Post-Chorus]
Am I losing you in the dark, baby?
Am I losing you in the dark, baby?
(If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you)

[Verse 2]
No more breaking stuff, no more acting up
Filling your head with doubt, you only ever catch me out
Don't wanna be talking to myself in a supermarket
Watching myself sink into a carpet somewhere
Don't wanna end up there

[Chorus]
So if you ever leave, I'm coming with you
Stuck to the gum that's stuck on your shoe
If you ever leave, I'm coming with you
I'm forever locking myself in the glass of your rearview
Trying to make friends with the friends you're close to
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you

Am I losing you in the dark, baby?
(If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you)
Am I losing you in the dark, baby?
(If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you)
I'm forever locking myself in the glass of your rearview
(If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you)
Trying to make friends with the friends you're close to
(If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you)

[Outro]
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you
If you ever leave me, I'm coming with you2Embed
