Come Catch Me, Bitch We Stack Chips Net Gatsby
Dyslexia, that chicken can't write so she doesn't leak
I do not text, I just came for Pepsi Prick
Chicken doesn't bend, so I send her away by taxi
No action, therefore do not expect interaction
Sketch action, and I pick your chicken infraction
Fresh promotion, I'm just waiting for my sanction
Lots of Kechs about here, lots of cash about here
No cash over there, no kechs about there
Is in that 'rarri
Ex regrets, hater says sorry (sorry)
Or with soes in that spirit, your niece and your bitch, yes that will be a party
Attention, I still just hit your chicken
But go beyond the States, Alaska
And we still dries our freshenhka
That you want to ride Mamma with me, Bicicleta, [?]

Money is happy everywhere
You just have to work just like Poland
And this summer I am hotter than coal
I have more principals than schools
Money is happy everywhere
You just have to work just like Poland
And this summer I am hotter than coal
I have more principals than schools

Congo Johnny Depp, in Love with the stack, but dive for a kech (kech)
In my new Gawwie, glide over the road, like a new butterfly knife
Young Boy stays calm, this is big man talk, about numbers and numbers (wow)
Come with Jamall in that fast, and they think is high how we surf that Snellie
Come see me, chickens want to keep kiwi
But I have to send her away just Mango, I am with Tonna
Do chic, I know men with just kiki
I know names with face just junia
You keep looking at my boys just chickie
Do normal, go to school, search Junta
Oh yeah, I am blessed, I am excited, we are moving fast, 220 the dash, oh yeah, oh yeah
Still on the streets, then on the bike, now in that jeep
I still look for bands, then in the stairs, now with that Benz
Come watch Me, I now make Money sporty just rugby
Can't touch me, put my boys at work just office

[Pre-hook]
Stay busy, otherwise your mother will not eat
Stay busy, otherwise your sister will not eat
Stay busy, otherwise your mother will not eat
Stay busy, otherwise your sister will not eat
