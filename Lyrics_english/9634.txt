Hands Free Lyrics[Intro]
Damn Keke, pop that gun sexy

[Chorus]
Gon' and do lil mama like you want to (Oh mama)
Ooh, I can't resist the way you want me (Oh na-na)
Damn, baby you play me like a banjo
Let me return the favor, do it hands free
Gon' and do lil mama like you want to (Oh mama)
Ooh, I can't resist the way you want me (Oh na-na)
Damn, baby you play me like a banjo
Let me return the favor, do it hands free
[Verse 1]
If I wind it back would you promise to break my bone?
(Aw yea yea yea yea yea)
I'ma make it snap right back with the play I’m gonna call, let's go long
(Aw yea yea yea yea yea)
No way that boy don't hang like that
You way too young to have all that
If you break the locks, you can gon' invade my home (Aw yea yea yea yea yea)
I dare you (Dare you), tongue kiss it
Baby, don't play with the bowl, go on, lick it (Lick it)
Better aim for the high score, terrific
‘Cause I'm the type that like to cum four, five times
Back to back, one by one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm willing and ready you can go and do that to me
I always been so freaky but only you got to see
There's something ‘bout you honestly that's got me so sexual
And what’s so magical about this shit here that we got?
And it’s so natural

[Chorus]
Gon' and do lil mama like you want to (Oh mama)
Ooh, I can't resist the way you want me (Oh na-na)
Damn, baby you play me like a banjo
Let me return the favor, do it hands free
Gon' and do lil mama like you want to (Oh mama)
Ooh, I can't resist the way you want me (Oh na-na)
Damn, baby you play me like a banjo
Let me return the favor, do it hands free
