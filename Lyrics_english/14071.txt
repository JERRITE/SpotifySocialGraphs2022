Forgot Your Name Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're so nice, I forgot your name
You're so nice, I forgot your name
All the other boys remember my name
Well, I'm so high, I forgot my name
All the other boys remember their name
I just play, don't remember the game

[Pre-Chorus]
White boys spinning records all night
Want a dance or taste? I don't bite
Black boys spinning records all night
I'm the rum and you're the Mai Tai
If you don't remember at all, it don't bother me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, I wanna just sing all night
And not remember one harmony
Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, you gotta rock your body right
Until my memory's wrong

[Verse 2]
Yeah
You're so nice, I forgot your name
Yeah
You're so nice, I forgot your name
She's the one that kept me up all night
Well, I'm so high, I forgot my name
All the other boys remember their name
I just play, don't remember the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Black girls spinning records all night
Make a mess, your dress is air-tight
White girls spinning records all night
Take her back, the math is finite
If you haven't come here to dance, then don't bother me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, I wanna just sing all night
And not remember one harmony
Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, I wanna just sing all night
And not remember one harmony
Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, I wanna just sing all night
And not remember one harmony
Leave it alone, I wanna just dance with you
And not remember one song
Leave it alone, you gotta rock your body right
Until my memory's wrong

[Outro]
Yeah
You're so nice, I forgot your name
Yeah
You're so nice, I forgot your name
She's the one that kept me up all night (Yeah)
You're so nice, I forgot your name
All the other boys remember my name (Yeah)
I just play, don't remember theâ€”Embed
