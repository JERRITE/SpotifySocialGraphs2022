Hello Linda Lyrics ["Hi Linda" letter]]

Hello pretty, how are you?
I would like to know what are you going to do tonight
Tell where you will be
That I spend to pick you at night

Come and Calm this craving
Tell me where are you, where I pick you
We go to the album and finish in my house
After a couple of drinks we look to see what happens
Although I know very well we knew each other
It has nothing weird that you and I wish
Let's not leave for tomorrow, maybe tomorrow we can't
Maybe tomorrow we can't

Hello pretty, how are you?
I would like to know what are you going to do tonight
Tell where you will be
That I spend pick up at night
Ehhh oh eohh
That I spend to pick you at night

It is more than midnight
And my name is that woman, he told me
Tell me daddy where we are going to take
And I told him

Let's take some
After a couple of drinks we give us some kisses
Let's take some
After a couple of drinks we give ourselves some kisses
Ehhh oh eohh ..
After a couple of drinks we give us some kisses
Ehhh oh eohh ..

Hi Linda, what are you going to do
Come with me woman
Do not think about it, see that
Let's go to dawn

I would like to know what are you going to do tonight
Tell where you will be
That I spend to pick you at night
