Beautiful and sensual lyrics ["beautiful and sensual" letter "ft. Nicky Jam & Daddy Yankee]

[Intro]
Hello my love, I have been accompanied
Dy
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam
Let me holla at you for a second

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
One of us is from the fine neighborhood
A very real guy (The Big Boss)
We played a bet, let's not look at you
That is going to steal you (tamo 'ready)
The other is half crazy, with twenty tattoos
And that street swing (Dimello Papi)
And in his Lamborghini, with wild lip
He wants to impress you
The third is a poet, brings serenades
Shines like the sun (just listening)
The boy of poetries
Sincerely, your server
[Choir: Romeo Santos, Daddy Yankee]
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
I want to own your bed, ah
Treat you like a lady, ah
The three have fame, ah
But nobody beats me, listen to me
Romeo speaks to you pretty and Yankee has Yamilette
I make you mischief, mommy until dawn
I have what is needed to get rid
That's why I ask you if you want to be my wife
With whom you go? I am curious
Tell me if it's me, give me the opportunity
I will be a little crazy but I can love you
Tell me mamacita, because I want to take you

[Choir: Romeo Santos, Nicky Jam]
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer (Zumba Nicky, eat on!)
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer (You Know Who's This Baby)

(DA-DDY!)
If you let you invite you, I give you what you need
We have something in common and it is that nobody competes
I like you have pique, don't be misplaced
If you want a movie, mommy, I have the tickets
If you are sick I give you my robitussin
Become my Russian, put me half Putin
Nicky flies like a Phoenix and Romeo, the bachata king
But I'm still the best pound for pound in the ring
Baby, I know that the decision is difficult
Recognize that there is no league here, I'm your option
I know you will be mine
When Shot does not fail my aim -Ã­a
I am the best of this trilogy
But whoever you choose, you win the lottery

[Choir: Romeo Santos, Nicky Jam / Daddy Yankee]
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer
Beautiful and sensual, supernatural
One of us has to conquer

[Outro]
Hey, Pina
Tell 'em the hitmakers in the Building
Da-Ddy!
