A LYRICSLLEGASE CONFUSION You hope
My wait had an end
You talked when I loved you

So strong that my patience ends today before you
My desire to live and I give up this suffering
Don't look for me to hate you
And I just find that I was ...

I was just one confusion
And that I am your big mistake
Forget of an old love
A confusion
What did you acted without thinking
That I would fall in love

To deceive with the heart
To then run
Without any explanation

And that I am your big mistake
Forget of an old love
A confusion
What did you acted without thinking
That I would fall in love with you and maybe
You could ruin my life
