One Hundred Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the willow bends towards the end of day
And twilight falls again
To the funny sound that a blackbird makes
Twilight falls again
As no good reason remains
I'll do the same, thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day a ship comes in
One day a ship comes in
But I can't say how or when
But I know somewhere a ship comes in every day
[Chorus 1]
There is no morphine
I'm only sleeping
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be bright
Something good

[Verse 2]
From my fingertips
The cigarette throws ashes to the ground
I'd stop and talk to the girls who work this street
But I got business farther down
Like one long season of rain
I will remain thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day a ship comes in
From far away a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
And you know somewhere a ship comes in every day

[Chorus 2]
There is no morphine
I'm only sleeping
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be bright
Just like something good
You might also like[Coda]
One day a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
Something bright
Something so good
One hundred days
A ship comes in every day
You know it's good
You know it's good
A ship comes in every day
One day a ship comes in
It's good
When it's something goodEmbed
