Tell me that you love me lyrics [introduction]
Come a little, listen to me
There is something you have to know
It has been a long time, I know that
But I know that you want to see me

[Chorus]
Tell me what you love me, tell me that you miss me
Although time passes, nothing changes inside
And that I have tried not to be by your side
But you have something that has me in love
Tell me what you love me, tell me that you miss me
Although time passes, nothing changes inside
And that I have tried not to be by your side
But you have something that has me in love

[Verse 1]
Each case has failed me, I can't advance
Stagnant, caught, I can't escape
And is that dress, that smell and your look
They have me hypnotized, I can't think

Do not ask me anything I'm going to give you
With a look you manage to catch me
If you ask for the moon, I'm going to download it
As you are only one and that will never change

[Chorus]
Tell me what you love me, tell me that you miss me
Although time passes, nothing changes inside
And that I have tried not to be by your side
But you have something that has me in love

[Bridge]
And even if you think it makes you happy

[Verse 2]
And even if you think it makes you happy
That fool knows nothing about you
I can see how he only makes you suffer
You want to hide from him
You might also tell me anything you love him
Look at my face and tell me what you want to see me
You know that I have much more to offer
Attention and love with a little and a little pleasure

To offer, I love you more that you must know
And even if you don't believe me, I do what it is for you
Just tell me that you are not going to go with him

Tell me that you are not going to go with him
(Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
Tell me that you are not going to go with him
With the

[Chorus]
Tell me what you love me, tell me that you miss me
Although time passes, nothing changes inside
And that I have tried not to be by your side
But you have something that has me in love
