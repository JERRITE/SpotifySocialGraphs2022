Cutter LyricsThe cuts you gave with your eyes remind me how
You used to cherish the feeling
The deepest wounds that you left they show me how
They would never end

Distasteful you try to be graceful
But look at the life you pulled from me
Somebody tell me it's over
When it's over
Cause my eyes refuse to see
The pain is overrated
I can't take it
The things that i hear you say
It's always you creating
I can't take it
The things that you're telling me

I tried to keep this a secret
But i've seen it
And i hate my eyes for it
I know you love to be hateful, so ungrateful
But my eyes refuse to see

The pain is overrated
I can't take it
The things that i hear you say
It's always you creating
I can't take it
The things that you're telling me

Sometimes it seems like you're immune...
Sometimes it seems like you hate it all
Now that you lost forever
Feels like you hate it all
Now that you lost
You might also likeThe pain is overrated
I can't take it
The things that i hear you say
It's always you creating
I can't take it
The things that you're telling me
Things that you're telling meEmbed
