Ambush Lyrics[Intro]
Sykes, Sykes
Woi, woi, woi, woi, woi

[Chorus: SJ, Bandokay & Double Lz]
I'm in the back of this car, no taxi
Sadly, I beg a man please try mad me
You'll see this hand ting get handy
Live-O corn when I slap this gladly
One in the head, jump out and get tappy
I didn't catch him, I didn't go back happy
Pattys, pattys, some fucking pattys
Bally up, spot man and get splashy
Switch
You don't wanna see me switch up off the moped with a stick
No witch
This sweet one stepped out in drip
Three balls in her tongue, this brown skins thick
Telling me she rates my songs and dickBack Rambos, not a fan of flicks
This .38 hand ting holds six
Like Turna, with bae I can't slip
I can talk on bare man's name
Fifteen, that was me on the ride with my blade
Then the next two rides man went on
The wap got brought, the spinner and the gauge
If you don't see no one at Tops or Commerce
We're circling Turnpike Lane
Tryna just ching man out of their J's
Ayy, broski holdin' the clutch then brake
[Verse 1: Double Lz]
Bro's too tapped, he keeps on squeezing
Sneezing, this is the shotgun season
Get back gang with the dotty's revealing
S slapped it, jumped out and beat it
Gang 'dem crash, no Flight of the Phoenix
Two in the dots for five of these eediats
Shh got cheffed up and then left bleeding
Lack on the road, that's normal procedures
These opp boys must've gone ku-ku
'Cause I'm really on drills, no fibs
Man's holding a fuck off chings
If you see Double Lz, step round with a limp
Always two guns up in the whip
Slap that quick, watch his whole body twitch
Don't think you can ride on the Nizz
Man slide right back in a tinted whip

[Verse 2: SJ]
If I slap this corn out the hand ting
It's a mad ting if I press this trigger
Six man squashed in this dinger
Chest shot chinger, Jump Out Gang with this spinner
This opp thot come way too inna
Cah her friend got shot, she don't know who's the driller
To all the opp boys, it's your friends we bill up
No reaction, they don't ride for their nigga
I'm on the O, ten toes with my soldiers
I don't beef my age, I got beef with olders
Man crash this corn off motors
This shotgun slaps and it flings my shoulder
Tion Wayne is a fucking joker
Carni tryna spill juice, that's soaker
Buck Fouyad, he tried run with his poker
He's with DV and they both got poked up
You might also like[Verse 3: Bandokay]
Yo, I'm tryna do it like Boogs
Swing blades in hoods but they got broski on the case
This shotgun come long like Grace
Half it-half it so it comes in the rave
On the stage with H, big shank on my waist
So I'm in N9 with my mates
Gang changing plates
Tape off your estates, then head straight back to the base
This sweet one keeps talking 'bout dates
If I slap this gauge, whole neighbourhood awakes
Bro Kush put his foot on the brakes
My driller backed it and try hit that face
If we can't see H then we gon' get blades
Either way, it works both ways
Bro's drunk off Wrays, got corn for days
So don't get blammed on the mains

[Chorus: SJ, Bandokay & Double Lz]
I'm in the back of this car, no taxi
Sadly, I beg a man please try mad me
You'll see this hand ting get handy
Live-O corn when I slap this gladly
One in the head, jump out and get tappy
I didn't catch him, I didn't go back happy
Pattys, pattys, some fucking pattys
Bally up, spot man and get splashy

You don't wanna see me switch up off the moped with a stick
No witch

Three balls in her tongue, this brown skins thick
