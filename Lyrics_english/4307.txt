To the nude lyricsnos we are the transformers of the genre

[Pre-Caro: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
Your body kills
It is poison (we are the transformers)
With his gaze on his network he wrapped me (eat on)
He left me speechless (ohh)
When he told me
(Just see your clothes slowly, slowly)
That in his room I was going to be waiting for me ... (Come on, eat on)
[Chorus: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
No clothes, naked (Erre XI)
Naked, she and me in her bed (Hey)
Sudados
Without clothes, naked (we are the transformers, heard?)
Naked, making it very slow (erre xi, eat on, eat on)
Dark ... (I know you want)
No naked clothes

[Verse 1: raphy flowers]
(I want to tell you something)
If you want to give me a call
That tonight I'm pa 'ti
Free chulería
Today I pull you to Paris
For you I assault a bank and buy a maseratti
Not that I believe me pa 'ti
But I fell in love with you
You have me enchula'o
Well in love
Walking on the alcoba sick in the middle of La'o
How well it feels (without fear)
In the Suda'o bed
Seeing the dawn the two together, sticks

[Chorus: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
No clothes, naked (Luny)
Naked
(I want you to take off your clothes now, slowly, slowly)
She and me in her bed
Sudados
No clothes, naked
Naked, making it very slow (up luny)
Dark, without clothes ... (there, soft)

I want to make love to you
(Without fear, we will do a remix tomorrow as this one, you know it, pa)
While kissing your neck
And I remove the mahon (hey, we are the transformers, how do you want me to tell you things, pa?)

I want to make love to you (hey, small)
While kissing your neck
And I take off the mahón (there is the bathroom to take off your shoes)

[Verse 2: Gerry "Lionize" Capo]
I want poison
So much curve and me without brake
I want to die by touching your skin ... although it sounds obscene
I know he kills you, how not
Keep tempting that you are getting more or less
I want to bite your mouth, I want to take off your clothes
I want you to go crazy while I serve you a drink
Then I make you an orgasm in the rocks
And I'm touching you while you touch me

[Pre-Caro: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
His body kills (Erre XI)
It is poison (we come very strong)
With his gaze on his network he wrapped me (and now without fear, lift my hands, above, that we left now)
Left me speechless
When he told me (hey, if you are not afraid, take off your shirt, raise your hand, above, now, without fear)
That in his room I was going to be waiting for me ...
[Chorus: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
No clothes, naked
Naked (we sound in the world)
She and me in her bed (Erre Xi)
Sudados
No clothes, naked
Naked, making it very slow (eat on)
Oscular, without clothes ... (slowly, slowly)

[Outro: Erre Xi, Tito "El Bambino"]
