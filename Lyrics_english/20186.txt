So Long, Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1: Familypet]
I'm coming clean
You can never mean this much to me
I've got these dreams
Up in the stars is where I wanna be
So you can see
So you believe
I've got to leave
Remember me

[Chorus: Familypet]
I'll make it on my own
Goodbye, so long
I'll miss you by my side
So long, goodbye
I'll make it on my own
Goodbye, so long
I'll miss you by my side
So long, goodbye
[Verse 2: LiL Lotus]
Just stuck and I felt this way for awhile
I'm too tired to smile
This is not what it used to be
Now it's everything we're not
And I'm learning how to forget
But I still have the smell of her cigarettes in my room
Lay down, close my eyes, and I think of you
And it's killing me
(Cut ties, I don't want to but I)
Maybe we just needed time to see
(Need to in the back of my mind)
But I'm sure we're onto better things
(Keep you tucked away deep inside)
Wasting time on what we used to be
(I tried, I tried)
But it'll never be the same
(Cut ties, I don't want to but I)
And I just hope that you remember me
(Need to in the back of my mind)
And what we said when we were seventeen
(Keep you tucked away deep inside)
I pray to god you see the best of things
(I tried, I tried)
Maybe it's better off this way
You might also like[Chorus: Familypet]
I'll make it on my own
Goodbye, so long
I'll miss you by my side
So long, goodbye
I'll make it on my own
Goodbye, so long
I'll miss you by my side
So long, goodbye

[Bridge: LiL Lotus]
Cut ties, I don't want to but I
Need to in the back of my mind
Keep you tucked away deep inside
I tried, I tried

[Alt Chorus: Familypet + (LiL Lotus)]
(Cut ties, I don't want to but I) I'll make it on my own
(Need to in the back of my mind) Goodbye, so long
(Keep you tucked away deep inside) I'll miss you by my side
(I tried, I tried) So long, goodbye
(Cut ties, I don't want to but I) I'll make it on my own
(Need to in the back of my mind) Goodbye, so long
(Keep you tucked away deep inside) I'll miss you by my side
(I tried, I tried) So long, goodbye
[Outro: Familypet + LiL Lotus in unison]
Cut ties, I don't want to but I
Need to in the back of my mind
Keep you tucked away deep inside
I tried, I triedEmbed
