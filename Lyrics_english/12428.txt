TranslationsPortuguêsWhat A Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
What a day to go around
Heavy in the sound of breaking mirrors
What a day to go around
Head up in the clouds, thought you were better
What a way to come around
While I take you out, I take you walking
Healing, mercy

[Chorus]
Shadow nearing
Course there's knowing
Where to put the right words, here in
Where does all the time go?
[Verse 2]
What a day to go around
Heavy in the sound of rivers breaking
What a day to go around
Well the sun came out and it was taking
Breaking me out
What a day to go around
While I take you out, I take you walking
Healing

[Chorus]
Missing light
Dancе around a pale blue sky
Wherе does all the time go?

Always fearing
Our hands clawing
Up against the light, it's nearing
Where does all the time go?

Always fearing
Our hands clawing
Up against the light, it's nearing
Where does all the time go?
