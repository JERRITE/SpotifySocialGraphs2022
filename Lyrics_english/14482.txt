Wedish Yellow (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "Wedding Yellow (Remix)"]

[Enter: Cardi B]
(Cardi, Ayy)
Said Lil 'Bitch, You Can't Fuck With Me If You Wted To
These outlines, these is network Bottoms, before is Bloody Shoes
Hit the store, i can get
And i'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comforable, look

[Chorus: duki]
If you want to see the future Better Follow me
I'm going there, anesthetized by medicine
Wait a min ', that nobody has the tomb of the Wanakin
Wannabes go to the side that those bored me, bored me
[Verse 1: duki]
Start on the bottom but they don't believe me because they didn't see me, eh-oh
I am doing too well in Music to be a gang member, eh-oh
Tamo 'burning fat, my friend' are to 'cook'
What happens to everything? They bother to see me make money
All corrarted that this is to 'pa' me, for me
You can k
The prettiest girl in the magazine, already wallet is no longer empty
Being the contrary to what they told me
I have the click phono, the cia follows me
To 'what I say is for real, what do you need to lie?
If I'm like that, I live like this, I shout like that, I sing like this, I spend like this, Yeah, Yeah
Caramel and Hennesy, yes, oh
Yellow wedding, the remix

[Chorus: duki]
If you want to see the future Better Follow me
I'm going there, anesthetized by medicine
Wait a min ', that nobody has the tomb of the Wanakin
Wannabes go to the side that those bored me, bored me

[Verse 2: duki]
If you wanna This, i drop a lott this
Maybe I Can Sell You On Piece
I change it for gold or cheese
Bitch, I drop to Dream, be a legend for living
More skrrt, more skrrt, and effective, and effective, damn, damn, damn
This was dead a while ago, Breathe
That was until I arrived and I 'on it
'Tamo playing on the radio of To' La Police
And in his car he has my sticker
Ice peak, wedding yellow, caramelo, huh
If you like Pégate, Mommy, Stop it, EY
Ice peak, wedding yellow, caramelo, huh
If you like Pégate, Mommy, Stop it

Said: '' Lil Bitch, You Can't Fuck With Me '' Even if you want
That's a Fact, Cardi B and the trap I am the mother
Hit the store and buy everything you want to buy
