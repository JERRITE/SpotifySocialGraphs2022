I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll say goodbye to all my sorrow
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
I'm so tired of getting nowhere
Seein' my prayers goin' unanswered
I guess the Lord must be in New York City

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, Lord, knockin' at your back door
Ain't it wonderful to be where I've always wanted to be?
For the first time, I'll breathe free
Here in New York City
[Verse]
Say goodbye to all my sorrow
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
So tired of getting nowhere
And seein' my prayers goin' unanswered
I guess the Lord must be in New York City

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, Lord, knockin' at your back door
Ain't it wonderful to be where I've always wanted to be?
For the first time, I'll breathe free
Here in New York CityYou might also likeEmbed
