Fading Like a Flower LyricsEvery time I see you, oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet, it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room, I feel I’m fading like a flower

Every time I
I can't let go
Every time I, every time I, every time I
I'm fading, fading

Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet, it seems I can’t let go (Can't let go)
Every time you leave the room, I feel I'm fading like a flower
(I'm fading like a flower)
Fading like a, fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Like a, like a, fading like a rose

(Yeah) Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet, it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room, I feel I'm fading like a flower
(I'm fading like a flower)

Every time I
Never let go
Every time I, every time I, every time I
I'm fading, fading

Every time, try to hide away
But when we, can’t let go (Can’t let go)
Every time you leave the room, I feel I'm fading like a flower
(I’m fading like a flower)

Fading like a, fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Like a, like a, fading like a rose (Can't let go), can't let go
I'm fading like a flower
I’m fading like a flowerYou might also likeEmbed
