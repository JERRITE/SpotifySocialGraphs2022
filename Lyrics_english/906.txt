Solo & empty lyrics [letter of "alone & empty"]

[Enter: Anuel AA]
Uah, Uah, Baby
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Your intention was to give me zeal '
You made up and made your hair (baby)
What a bad luck, with her you saw me
The one of us, I no longer think about that (no, no)
And you always went like that (like this)
You never wanted to see me well without you (without you)
And you were never 'pa' me (pa 'me)
It seems that I left (uah)
[Chorus: Anuel AA]
And what happened?
Now he is alone and empty (alone and empty)
I remember, it was growing '(I was growing)
Look now I bit 'and repent' (eh-eh, baby)
And what happened?
Now he is alone and empty (alone and empty)
I remember, it was growing '(I was growing)
Look now by biting 'and without company, Eah

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
Baby, love me without measure '(Oah)
A forgiveness does not heal the wound (Oah)
Baby, for you I gave life
But you went to GÃ¼ira (Uah)

[Pre-Caro: Anuel AA]
I talked to the man in the mirror
And I said: "I was not born for pendejo"
Baby, give me band (uah)
Take me in band (uah)
I talked to the man in the mirror
And I said: "I was not born for pendejo"
Baby, give me band (uah)
Take me in band
Uah, Uah, Baby
