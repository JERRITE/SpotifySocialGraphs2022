Brother (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I will go down
And I will go down to the rec
With hopes to see you
With hopes to see you again
I need to see you
I need to see you, my friend

And now my mind is
My mind is a goddamn mess
And all my vision
My vision is so impaired
I need to see you
It's my only way to forget
[Chorus 1]
And brother, brother, brother
I'm goin' under
So tell me what I gotta do
And lover, lover, lover
Come make things better
And do the things that lovers do

[Verse 2]
I know she's hurting
And that now it's on to me
But it's not easy
It's just not easy for me
'Cos I just can't believe
To see you I need my memory

[Chorus 2]
And brother, brother, brother
I'm going under
So tell me what I gotta do
And lover, lover, lover
Come make things better
And do the things that lovers do
And brother, brother, brother
It's getting harder
So take my hand and walk me through
And brother brother brother

And all these people
All these people in this place
All these people and they don't know what to say
But you are too hard to explainEmbed
