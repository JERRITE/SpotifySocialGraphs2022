Hug lyricskako returned, in the heat of your hug 
 Like bird eager for a nest 
 I suffered sadness, when I left you 
 That has not been experienced by anyone 
 I have returned, and you will be rescued again 
 I will never leave again 
 Because if you were my hug 
 It was like I was hugging heaven 
 And I hug as well as your smile 
 The heat of 'Yong kiss, nothing is as hot 
 It still hugs the mind 
 I have returned, and you will be rescued again 
 I will never leave again 
 Because if you were my hug 
 It was like I was hugging heaven 
 And I hug as well as your smile 
 Ooohhh ... 
 And you are again aware 
 I will never leave again 
 Because if you were my hug 
 It was like I was hugging heaven 
 And I hug as well as your smile 
 The 'Yong smile 
 Ooohhh ... 
 I hug ... you might also likeembed
