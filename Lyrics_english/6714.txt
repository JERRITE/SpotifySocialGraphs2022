Germantown Lyrics[Intro: Koopsta Knicca]
Smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo
Smoking, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo
[Verse 1: HU$TLE GOD]
H-S-L be the mafia
18 wheeler, no stopping us
Popular in your area
Cut these moves marvelous
Pardon me, I mean, pardon us
Moving deep as a party bus
Blowing smoke in your residence
Nigga feeling quite excellent
Ain't no if I or when I will
Take the globe in my second hand
Call me Slim Diddy, hustle man
Toking and doing the hustle dance
Loafin' rarely, that's when I can
When I do, I'm relaxin
With two soul eaters and half a xan
Savor blunts as I plot and shoot
You puss

[Hook: Koopsta Knicca]
Smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo
Smoking, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo

Brrrrat! That's the sound of a gat
Spray a chopper, sprayin' Uzis, blocka, blocka
Bullets tearin' you just like a sheet of looseleaf
Give me the loot, give me the loot, please
Give me the paper, bitch, I would rather get it now than later
Tired of being broke
Skullfuck an alligator, make his scales into a fucking robe
If I can't afford it, bitch, I'll make it on my own
Fuck a hoe, I ain't got a bone to throw
Used to bring a bitch to eat sushi with me
Now I'm eating Mikimoto solo
All these hoes know not to get in Oddy's snow globe
$now Leopard keep it so cold
Bitch, I gotta go, hoe, go home, don't call me
Money on my mind, make my head so foggy
But it could be the weed, regardless
Oddy still makin' all these bitches soggy

[Hook: Koopsta Knicca]
Smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo
Smoking, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off, smokin' on a junt, with my niggas drinking O.E
Stop off at the liquor store
Get some 'yac, and we headed for the indo
[Verse 3: YUNG $CARECROW]
Smoking, cheifin', I'm that reaper
Demon creepin' right beneath you
Call me Caesar, *59 leader
Beat his head in with the cleaver
I got a fever, and my sickness now is rising'quick
Breaking the meter body temperature is 666
Straight jacket shawty tryna calm me with a script of meds
"$carecrow, $carecrow, $carecrow!"
All these voices I hear in my head
Now cover the bed with bodies and lead
$uicide known to be raising the dead
Walk in my shed
Feeling the dread of staring at hundreds of old severed heads5Embed
