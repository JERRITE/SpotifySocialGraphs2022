Cassette Lyrics deleted [letter from "Delete Cassette"]

[Intro: Maluma, The RudeBoyz]
We know yours
RUDEBOYZ

[Pre-stribe]
Yesterday you kissed me and you couldn't stop
And you danced until dawn
When I woke up I wanted to call you
And now he tells me that Cassette deleted
That does not remember that night
Because she erased cassette
He says he doesn't know me
And I want to see her again

[Chorus]
And that the drinks, raised 'in their head
She with anyone does not kiss
I want you to know that I am interested
And there is no day that I don't stop thinking about its beauty

And that the drinks, raised 'in their head
She with anyone does not kiss
I want you to know that I am interested
And there is no day that I don't stop thinking about its beauty

[Post-stribe]
I told you mommy, take a drink
And when I get drunk 'pa' my house we go
I was surprised when you got that cigar
You took so much that you have forgotten

[Verse 1]
And quiet ma ', it doesn't happen na'
You went crazy but more na '
You were shouting to kiss you
On the staircase and on the couch
And quiet ma ', it doesn't happen na'
I know your weakness
Only a couple of glasses will be enough
To know you in intimacy

And you, mommy, how do you say you don't remember?
How my body heats you
Come, tell me on the face and don't lie
Let's stop playing

And you, mommy, how do you say you don't remember?
How my body heats you
Come, tell me on the face and don't lie
Let's stop playing

[Pre-stribe]
Yesterday you kissed me and you couldn't stop
And you danced until dawn
When I woke up I wanted to call you
Now he tells me that Cassette deleted

That does not remember that night
Because she erased cassette
He says he doesn't know me
And I want to see her again

[Chorus]
And that the drinks, raised 'in their head
She with anyone does not kiss
I want you to know that I am interested
And there is no day that I don't stop thinking about its beauty
And that the drinks, raised 'in their head
She with anyone does not kiss
I want you to know that I am interested
And there is no day that I don't stop thinking about its beauty

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for you to see if we repeat them
That night, that we did it well
Between drinks we undress
The bottles we drink
To the madness they took us
It was a lot that we hesitated
Impossible not to remember

[Bridge]
And you, mommy, how do you say you don't remember?
How my body heats you
Come, tell me on the face and don't lie
Let's stop playing

And you, mommy, how do you say you don't remember?
How my body heats you
Come, tell me on the face and don't lie
Let's stop playing
