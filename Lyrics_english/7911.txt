Love to Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living in the fast lane
Time is precious
I'm counting down the seconds
I can feel you on my skin
I go
In this direction
I'm sorry that yours is different
And it's tearing me up within

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep moving back and forth
I go my way, you go yours
Lost in the middle of it all
Will things be the same when I come back?
Don't forget you told me that
You'll always pick up, pick up when I call
[Chorus]
I'll take our love to go
(I'll take our love to go)
'Cause everywhere I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go
(I'll take our love to go)
No matter where I go
You'll be my home

[Post-Chorus]
I'll take our love to go
No matter where I go
I'll take our love to go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go
No matter where I go
I'll take our love to go
You'll be my home

[Verse 2]
All in
You give me heaven
I got no hesitation
Have to deal with the tears
Feel the radiation
Of my feelings
I can't give them a meaning
But I know that you're worth the risk
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep moving back and forth
I go my way, you go yours
Lost in the middle of it all
Will things be the same when I come back?
Don't forget you told me that
You'll always pick up, pick up when I call

[Chorus]
I'll take our love to go
(I'll take our love to go)
'Cause everywhere I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go
(I'll take our love to go)
No matter where I go
You'll be my home

[Outro]
I'll take our love to go
No matter where I go
I'll take our love to go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go
No matter where I go
I'll take our love to go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go (Love to go)
No matter where I go (Love to go)
I'll take our love to go (Love to go)
You'll be my home (Love to go)
I'll take our love to go (Love to go)
No matter where I go (Love to go)
I'll take our love to go (Love to go)
You'll be my homeEmbed
