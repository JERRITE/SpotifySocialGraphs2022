Love Tonight (Robin Schulz Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight

[Verse 1]
When you're tired
When you're lonely
Can just reach out an arm
Know I'lI be there
I'II help you weather the storm
[Pre-Chorus]
Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'lI be there
You will never be alone
All I need is your love tonight

[Chorus]
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All need is your love tonight
(Your love tonight)

[Verse 2]
In that moment
When you're feeling like therе's nothing at all
Reach out to me
Know that I'll answer thе call

[Pre-Chorus]
Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight, tonight, tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All need is your love tonight
All need is your love tonight
All need is your love tonight
All need is your love tonightEmbed
