Bodytalk (STFU) Lyrics[Verse]
I close my ears and eyes
We way to drunk and high
We don't need them pick up lines
'Cause you and I
We'll get it on
That's right
Fuck me up in my mind
Don't stop
We're smashing out the lights
[Chorus]
I close my ears and eyes
We way to drunk and high
We don't need them pick up lines
'Cause you and I
We'll get it on
That's right
Fuck me up in my mind
Don't stop
We're smashing out the lights

[Drop]
Shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk
Shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk
Shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk

[Post-Drop]
Shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk
Do the body talk
Bo-body talk
