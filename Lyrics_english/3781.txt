Ya-di-ya-di-ya-ya, mmh-ah-mmh
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from, perhaps outer space
With the foxy expression I can’t really hear what the fox says (What did you say?)
If I show you a copy of my bank statement will you come over?
How should I stage my attack I should study
Woo there's enough bullets
Just open your mouth, a steak is flying in, fly, fly
[Pre-Chorus]
Beautiful, it's not a waste
Money is power
You're not a snob
This is just my heart
An expression of it
So take it
Get ready, load and then fire

[Chorus]
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Eat and wear
All you like I'll get the bill
Eat and wear
All you like and thеn fire

[Verse 2]
Pow! What’s the problem
You just need to еnjoy
Wrap your whole body (Skrrt skrrt) in jewels like rappers do
Only call black cabs and meals (Okay) are Michelin
Everything charged on my (Okay) credit card
Until everything becomes unnecessary, everything is a one-time payment
Use it up like game money (I'ma rich)
Don't feel pressured, ever
But please be my oriole
When I see your back I'll immediately back hug

Beautiful, it's not a waste
Money is power
You're not a snob
This is just my heart
Just an expression of it
Take it
Get ready, load and then fire

[Chorus]
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Eat and wear
All you like I'll get the bill
Eat and wear
All you like and then fire

[Bridge]
It’s all favor, extravagance and forced
Honestly I want to buy your heart
Tell me how to seduce you
I'm dumb so I don't really know what's in a woman's heart
What kind of things do I need to do
Don't avoid me
I don't want to get hurt again
Even though you do all this to me, you're still in my heart
[Chorus]
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang! tang! tang!
Tang! tang! tang! tang!, tang! tang! tang! tang!
Eat and wear
All you like I'll get the bill
Eat and wear
All you like and then fire1Embed
