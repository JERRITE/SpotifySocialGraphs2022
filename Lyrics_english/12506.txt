My Trigger Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing, you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

[Chorus]
Baby let's forget the money, forget the money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger
[Post-Chorus: Harmonization]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
They say your body is full of sin
But they can't see the world that we in
Your body is the road to where peace begins
I'll give you mine, we can take a spin, spin

[Chorus]
Baby let's forget the money, forget the money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

[Post-Chorus: Harmonization]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh

I got paid and all my dreams came
True, true, true
Now I'm waiting in my car for
You, you, you

[Verse 1]
I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing and you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

[Chorus]
Baby let's forget the money, forget the money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger
Baby let's forget the money, forget the money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

[Post-Chorus: Harmonization]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
