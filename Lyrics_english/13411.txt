Translationsdeutschengishtodo de ti Lyrics [letter of "all of you"]

[Intro]
One, Two
One, Two, Three, Four
He says, Ra-Rauw

[Verse 1]
THE WIND SOBA YOUR HAIR
UH-UH-UH-UH-UH
Those beautiful eyes kill me
UH-UH-UH-UH-UH
I like your smell, your skin color
And how do you make me feel
I like your little mouth, that rosita lipstick
And how you kiss me (Yeh)
[Pre-stribe]
With you I want to wake up
Do it after smoking (EY)
I no longer have to look for
Something out of here
You combine with the sea
That bikini looks phenomenal
There is no gravity that can raise me
You get bad to me (Yah!)

[Chorus]
Accelerate to my beats
And what I like everything about you
From toa 'your part ’, what do I decide?
And what I like everything about you

[Post-stribe]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
And what I like everything about you
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
And what I like everything about you

[Verse 2]
Fifth Avenue, does not go to mall
She knows that I get to just a call
In the Raptor I like to put it in Four
The Jogger Large, the Small shirt
Like the Keto diet
For you, I control myself and stay still
Although I want to eat you to 'that complete
From that ass I turned a teco, huh
Mi-Mi-Micro Dose ', Rola, Oxi
Kissing that 'Lip ’Glossy
I already gave him the 'posi
Coconut shampoo, Chanel her wallet
It drives me crazy from the helmet to ’pedalo '

You get bad to me (Yah!)

[Chorus]
Accelerate to 'my beats
And what I like about you
Toa 'your part', which one do I decide?
And what I like everything about you

Ah, ah-ah (all of you), ah-ah (all of you), ah-ah
And what I like everything about you
Ah, ah-ah (all of you), ah-ah (all of you), ah-ah
And what I like everything about you
