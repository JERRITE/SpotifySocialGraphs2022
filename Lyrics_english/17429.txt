Without You (Mesto Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Same story on a different page
I just wanted to escape
Didn't you know that?
Dark nights into brighter days
Always feeling outta place
Didn't you know that?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not saying I feel nothing
When I think of all the memories yeah
Of you and me yeah
But I'm tired of holding on to something
Just because I'm scared you're going to leave yeah
You're gonna leave yeah
[Chorus]
I'm not sorry that I've changed for the better
That I got myself together
Guess I thought that you'd be happier
I'm not sorry that it didn't last forever
But it's bеtter late than nevеr
And I'm moving on with or without ya

[Pre-Drop]
I'm not sorry that it didn't last forever
But it's better late than never
And I'm moving on with or without ya

[Drop]
And I'm moving on with or without ya

[Verse 2]
I didn't know I was alone
Till I let the feeling go
I hope you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not saying I feel nothing
When I think of all the memories yeah
Of you and me yeah
But I'm tired of holding on to something
Just because I'm scared you're gonna leave yeah
You're gonna leave yeah

I'm not sorry that I've changed for the better
That I got myself together
Guess I thought that you'd be happier
I'm not sorry that it didn't last forever
But it's better late than never
And I'm moving on with or without ya

[Pre-Drop]
I'm not sorry that it didn't last forever
But it's better late than never
And I'm moving on with or without ya

[Drop]
And I'm moving on with or without yaEmbed
