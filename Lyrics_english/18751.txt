City of God Lyrics [song text for "City of God"]

[Part 1]
Drug bosses, gangs, inhalier 'the plankton burns
In the dusty ghetto that is called the city of God
The edge districts don't even have paved roads
There are few people who venture into the gang districts
A soulless place where the drug dealer ticks coke
Where even a kid looks up to big gangsters at the young age
Where you have been going the illegal path since childhood
You tick the grass package, have nothing in the stomach, choose the crime
You go out on hot days, wake up sweaty because you sell grass
Nobody saw anything, a patrol car appears in the district
And while some gas trucks were robbed
The others had running as grashusters
Doesn't matter, because somehow there was zaster out there
Some die, some bring the cops in
Gangsters never give up, they just pull their heads briefly (head in)
Even small kids mix up on the block pot (pot)
And here the story of SpongeBozz begins
[Hook]
City of go-O-O-O-Och, Bikini Bottom
Gang fights, bullets fly, you are hit in the streets
City of go-O-O-O-Oz, sponge connection
Projector, gang gangster who stretch the plankton
This is the city of God, where even small kiddies handle weapons
After they kill you, polish the creak
Consume sniffs and hash, tickers the crabkoke deal
Courage the city with plankton, I want to control the city

[Part 2]
I had as a ghettokid before I checked the dope in the streets
Not even hair on the sack, but a huge big face
At my first attack, I was still half -fully stupid
But violence is practicing young, kept in cold -blooded
I never wanted to start a harmless coup
Driven by money and violence in the hotel robbery, slam down all people
It all ended in black-red blood laugh (laughter)
From petty criminal crooks in the block to fabric sticker
Nothing spongie, hold the gun at your head, I'm now sponge the boss, you wanker
I will kill every little dealer gratf (deadlocks)
Knalle crab choken (-noses) and snap the dopy shop
The dealer, the coal, does packs that stretches the crabkoke and plankton
Gone with the robberies because the big money is now in drug trafficking
Stech's enemies bloody with a knife (knife), leading figure and blackmail
Fornsteaders G in the district and mostly sought -after criminals (criminals)
The gangster boss with MGS (MGS), check the package on the block
City of God, I put my fate in the hands of God
You might so like [Hook]
Go-O-O-Oz, Bikini Bottom
Gang fights, bullets fly, you are hit in the streets
City of go-O-O-O-Oz, sponge connection
Projector, gang gangster who stretch the plankton
This is the city of God, where even small kiddies handle weapons
After they kill you, polish the creak
Consume sniffs and hash, tickers the crabkoke deal
Courage the city with plankton, I want to control the city

[Part 3]
I made sure that no other ticker dope and powder checked
Checked all drug cover spaces, large sales quantities
The supplier came, I pulled a line and checked the goods
She was bagged in the shop, we ticked white and green in the streets
Massive dope in streets deal
Made seven giants with plankton and crab cocaine letters even in the weak month
Name me the powder man, the rapping pusher sponge
Packed bags to tens (tens) or parcels to hundreds
Some wanted to tear this business under nail
I littered the rival gangs off the track, distributed Koke, steered the street prices
If you miss a payment to the sponge, then
I give you a load from the pumpgun as a warning for the others
Yo, now the weedticker gives the trunk knife
Every opponent, hits, unerring like Man√© the Stecher (Stecher)
Yo, I distribute the fabric in my block as with City of God
Baller with my bell a hole in your head, sponge is curly the boss
[Hook]
Go-O-O-Oz, Bikini Bottom
Gang fights, bullets fly, you are hit in the streets
City of go-O-O-O-Oz, sponge connection
Projector, gang gangster who stretch the plankton
This is the city of God, where even small kiddies handle weapons
After they kill you, polish the creak
Consume sniffs and hash, tickers the crabkoke deal
Courage the city with plankton, I want to control the city embed
