TranslationSenglishromanization (if you do) Lyrics [Intro]
So, it's me Again? Huh ...
Why you gotta be like this?
Forget it

[Verse 1]
If you do, good if I do
How do I say I'm wrong every day
Just try to win
Are tears not your weapon
[Verse 2]
At first
But every day I kneel
I also inflated what I did a little wrong
I pushed me to the cliff
I don't know, but you still
I was able to endure because I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Every Day, Every Night
Feel Like a Fool, You Gotta Know
Why do you tell me why why?
Can we go back

[Chorus]
If you are
If you do, I can't win
Suddenly you become someone else
When it's good, make me more anxious
If I do, if you do it
If you just say something, you break up every day
I can't approach more
Do not love more

[Verse 3]
I talked about your major
Pierce the side and get the temple
I'm already tired of being judged.
I want to get out
My friend is a must for me
It's just an uneasy seed
Another mistake
If I do, huh
You might Also Like [Verse 4]
I want you to do it in moderation
Even though you want you, you can't stop
I will do well when I sleep while sleeping
When I have no words, I'll be good
It's frustrating, lamenting to whom
Sometimes I think it's trapped

[Chorus]
If you are
If you do, I can't win
Suddenly you become someone else
When it's good, make me more anxious
If I do, if you do it
If you just say something, you break up every day
I can't approach more
Do not love more

[Interlude]
It's up to you if you wanna break up
I don't care
Just Do Whatver You Want
IT doesn't mater to me
I'm just go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Every Day, Every Night
Feel Like a Fool, You Gotta Know
Why do you tell me why why?
Can we go back
[Chorus]
If you do, it is all right (if you do)
If you do, I can't win (OOH)
Suddenly you become someone else (becomes someone else)
When it is good, make me more anxious (uneasy)
If I do, you if I am (oh, oh)
If you just say something, you break up every day (break up every day)
I can't get me more (not)
I don't love you more 4Embed
