Lyrics falls [lyrics by "falls the night"]

[Chorus: Dollar Selmouni & Hard Gz]
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost
I know there is hope in this gloomy world
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost (Yah, ah)
I know there is hope in this gloomy world (oh)
[Verse 1: hard gz]
Tired, uncle, I'm no longer to give you explanations
But as I owe to this, come, two balls
I am a starving who only writes lines
And more than letters I balancing with emotions
Various addictions, inside a brain with hypochondria
Open sky, dead child, back to monotony
A thousand concerts, deserted roads towards the day
That I am satisfied within this cold house
Hunting, the united soldiers like a swarm
Utopia does not go back, it only expands
No one who sends, about this philosophy
To fight day by day for a piece of bread with cold
I'm hooked to live away from my blood
Because this knows me little and I'm very hungry
And I do well
I don't think my parents worry
While knowing that I have a bed where to go to bed
Liters to drink, I have a lot of late
I smoke big green to deranged me
Who do I call on Friday? I don't know who to trust
Because I only see snakes who want to buy me
And calm down, I'm making big shit
It is the kid who criou baixo to Ría do Randa
On Ríos de Agua street falling in the north
In the Rave Chaval they are left to do sports

The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost
I know there is hope in this gloomy world
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost
I know there is hope in this gloomy world

[Bridge: Dollar Selmouni]
I know there is hope in this gloomy world, oh-oh
(Yah)

[Verse 2: Dollar Selmouni]
I don't want to 'anymore, I'm no longer looking for
I just want to free me and others, and this goes
For those who are, what they leave
For those who will arrive, it is seen, we are going to liar
And it is normal, that this boy lets herself take
That look for your departure and that you will find it
And it doesn't know me badly
Because I know that if he falls, he gets up again
And it is normal, that this boy lets herself take
That look for your departure and that you will find it
And it doesn't know me badly
Because I know that if he falls, he gets up again
[Chorus: Dollar Selmouni]
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost
I know there is hope in this gloomy world
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
I trust, in the boys who are lost
I know there is hope in this gloomy world

[Outro: Dollar Selmouni]
The night falls and it's cold
Pay attention to the wise, my friend, do not go 'put troubles
The night falls and it's cold
The night falls and it's cold, oh-ohembed
