Die Inside a Dream LyricsI could break your skin, with my teeth, like a peach
They like gizmo where you been?
I been fucking shit up in peace
Imma spill your fuckin guts and
Mix it up like concretes
Right inside your fucking rib cage
I rip pages out delete

All that bullshit you believe stupid lil bitch
You so naive
Grab yo head and then i cleave until your bloods
Running up my sleeves
Fuck the pain you feel I’m in my head like 24/7
We’re not the same I peel the skin off a human like it’s heaven

Bitch I need my fucking pay back
Like where the fuck my blade at
Watch me touch the fucking heart of any living thing I aim at

Fuck the pain you feel I’m stuck inside your head like obsession
Call me the rainy cloud that follows you around around like depression

(Hook)
2x
I don’t want to die inside a dream
Let me sink in the marina
With the ocean my bodys a breather

I could break yo skin, with my hands like tissue paper
Torture in my nature
Call me the body deflator
I could liquify your whole body turn it to vapor
Smoke you like I needed me a hit to chill my anger

Bitch you out your mother fucking mind
If you think we cool now?
I wish I could stab you from behind watch your Guts pool out
I’ll get excited about your death
Like a kid when Schools out
Imma mess around inside ur head
Let’s break the tools out
You might also likeCut, then I snip
Don’t give a fuck, don’t give a shit
How you feelin I’m the captain and I want to sink the ship
Waves in my lungs, like a duffel bag ah bricks
Death is guaranteed and beautiful like a lunar eclipse

(Hook)
2x
I don’t want to die inside a dream
Let me sink in the marina
With the ocean my bodys a breatherEmbed
