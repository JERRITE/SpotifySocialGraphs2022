WANT ME DEAD THEN PUT ME IN THE DIRT Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch I am amazed
How they really think I changed
Calling my shit trash
And claiming that I ain't the same
What's your aim?
I don't need you to explain
Know you only want that rage
So i'll give it to you straight

[verse 1]
Pussy yu weak to me
Don't even speak to me
Demons are sleeping inside of my head
Killing the entity it too Impossible
Crying for help it's inaudibly said
I am the one that they all love to hate
And i know that they hoping that
I will be dead and they waiting the moment
They see me without any life in me
When I take my last breath
[Chorus]
Blast first, Blast first, You better blast  first
Blast first, Blast first ,You better blast  first
Blast first, Blast first, You better blast  first
Blast first, Blast first, You better blast  first
Last Words Yeah, You wanna hear my last words
Last Words Yeah You wanna hear my last words
Last Words Yeah, You wanna hear my last words
Last Words Yeah You wanna hear my last words

[Bridge]
Blast First
Yeah bitch you bestter blast first

[Verse 2]
Should know i been working
Tryna evolve as a person
As an artist put my heart in it
But the love ain't returning
Got my blood boiling, it's burning
And the voices screaming muder
In my head, they want me dead
So hurry up, and fucking murk me

[Outro]
