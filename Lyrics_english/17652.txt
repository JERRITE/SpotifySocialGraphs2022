Need to Feel Loved Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come catch me babe
I'm fallin’
Come save me baby
I'm callin'

[Verse 2]
Come be with me babe
(Come be with me babe)
Come as you are
(Come as you are)
Come catch a fire babe
(Come catch a fire babe)
Don’t let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
[Pre-Refrain]
Come touch me baby
I need to be loved

[Refrain]
Come hold me babe
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved

[Refrain]
Come hold me babe
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Come catch a feeling
It's electrifying me
Eyes wide open
I'm dreamin'
Free fallin' baby
Awake before I'm down
Free fallin' baby
Awake before I’m down
