One night LyricsOne night, give me one night of your time again
Make you feel alright again
You been runnin' and the ice just fell
That’s my girl, would you ride for that
Big whip, so the side's left down
Ooh

One night, give me one night of your time again
Make you feel alright again
You been runnin' and the ice just fell
That’s my girl, would you ride for that
Big whip, so the side's left down
Ooh
Let your back-end cock like a scorpion
'Cause all the real bad girls need an audience
She spilled juice on my shoes, so unfortunate
I took her hotel room and recordеd it
I bring her back to life, I make hеr breathe real deep

In my afterlife, I'll be in Givenchy
Snappin', with the green on me
But they said they won't smoke it, ah-nee-naw-nee
That's an ambulance, I only hit the strip club for the ambiance
She wanna dance on a champion

One night, give me one night of your time again
Make you feel alright again
You been runnin' and the ice just fell
That’s my girl, would you ride for that
Big whip, so the side’s left down
Ooh

One more Henny and we're faded
Hope no one post us on the socials
I’m only here for the night
So I let more time go by
I can't turn water into wine
But I can make sure there's bottles comin' all night
Design with my killies, tryna catch your vibe
No time for bad mind
You might also likeYo, see the way that it works, we step in the room and they twerk
All these bangers we droppin’ got these jessie's goin' berserk
They already know I'm the man, that's why they like hey boy, be chulo
Tell your man that I'm back, even he know I'm numero uno, uno
You know when I pull up out the Wraith with my money face
Just know you gon' feel exactly how the money taste
Girl, watch out, I make it work
Promise, squeeze each and every one of you in a mug

Ooh now give me one night (one night)
One night of your time again
Make you feel alright again
You been runnin' and the ice just fell
That's my girl, would you ride for that
Big whip, so the side's left down
Ooh

Yeah
Catch me dancing in your ends with big spends
I own the bottles of bubbly for your girlfriend
And she be sat at my table, it's getting intense
Because you don't wanna know what she put in her hand
She be rubbing on my leg and tickle my neck end
She booty-poppin', I'm watchin' erotic dancing
She keep on telling me that she don't have a boyfriend
And I could not give a fuck, guess how the night went
One night, fun times when you come to mine
Sexy, dressed to impress me for the (whole night)
Oh, you look good, yeah you look good
Back, make me have to look back, and that's a good look
Big slap, hit that, baby, bum-bum
Whine again, and make me lose my mind again
You're giving me those eyes again
Oh

One night, give me one night of your time again
Make you feel alright again
You been runnin' and the ice just fell
That's my girl, would you ride for that
Big whip, so the side's left down
OhEmbed
