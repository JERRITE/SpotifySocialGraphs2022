Dreaming Out Loud Lyrics[Chorus]
Last night, I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Next year in the Winter, let's give it a try
I'll keep on dreaming out loud tonight

[Verse 1]
Summer's over, but you still haven't call me back
We're just getting older, soon enough, it'll be to late to act
Let's do it again, let's ride on the waves of gold
(In California sundown)
I'll wait for your call 'cause I wouldn't go on my own
[Chorus]
Last night I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Can we still make it happen? It's worth a try
And I might keep on dreaming out loud
It's a beautiful lie, staying under blue skies
Next year in the Winter, let's give it a try
I'll keep on dreaming out loud tonight

[Verse 2]
Winter is dawning and I can't seem to adapt
And somebody told me that you've felt the same way since we went
Why won't you give me a call? We'll ride on those waves again
(In California sunrise)
And I can wait through a storm 'cause without you, it wouldn't be the same

[Chorus]
Last night I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Can we still make it happen? It's worth a try, oh
And I might keep on dreaming out loud
It's a beautiful lie, staying under blue skies
And next year in the Winter, let's give it a try
I'll keep on dreaming out loud tonight

[Outro]
Yeah, I'll be dreaming out loud tonight
I'll keep on dreaming out loud tonightYou might also likeEmbed
