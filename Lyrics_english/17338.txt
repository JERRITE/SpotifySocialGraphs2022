Dot da genius, baby

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
What carajos do these people know about me? (MHM)
All on the street talk about me (MHM)
A long time ago, you used to doubt me (what?)
Now that you see that I am caught, you want to get out of me (MHM)
What no people know about me (MHM)

Now that you see that I am caught, you want to get out of me
[Verse 1: Denzel Curry & Kid Cudi]
I have to you, I have your boy feeling as if I had a fat Gucci (BRR)
The police want to stop me, the whores-putes want to sue me (Yuh)
If you have some money, you better bring it to me (yes)
All on the web act as if they knew me (Woo)
I was never a new self (Nah), I'm just enjoying new shit
Seen as if it served an eighth ball, without pool stick (yes)
And my record is clean, so I never shit
Denzel an animal, yes, I'm in my shit of Zuu
Fuu shit, I could never fly, seen as a chicken that is about to fry
Curry The Killer, the black is me, I will take you to take a walk
Take a black aerodeslizer on black that floats
Or I will stop at a Phantom like Kids see ghosts, uh (yes)

[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Kid Cudi]

Now that you see that I am caught, you want to get out of me (yes)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The woman captures feelings, tell them they want to have my child (uh-juh)
Drugping for the week and I'm jumping out of the roof
In the tree, I put under game with the crazy friend
I have them, take them out, I am very faded, it often fades (yes)
Real blacks, yes, look at it, let me hear it
I have been the worst, ask Dennis, we have been in that dog and with her, Hey-Hey
Automatic (hey), black does not want static
I tried to tell him that he was tragic, made those blacks panic and that (Yuh)
Very cold, double, look at me bow
I'm too concentrated, I keep a new goal, I'm living my dreams (JA)
Black type that will enter anger, evil crawls
The devil cannot hold the middle finger as it is (UH, yes)

[Verse 3: jid]
Tell me what fuck people know about boys?
A lot of cakes turn black, do not work in Dominos
Take a slice of a black, deliver it, not a digiorno
Ceno before the sun puts on, then I went out the main door
So I'm sinking Girbaud, then I go back to my way
I bet that a damn black supports me
Does anyone want a tec?, No
Let's go when the night goes crazy and the lights are low
When the light is shit but I could go
Because I could change to the mode of crisis
Light fault, but I'm about to explode
I'm going to where nobody knows me
I'm in a ghost, mm, maybe the rolls
I heard that I was quitting smoking, but twice the dose (twice the dose)
I am an adult, standing on ten of my feet fingers, I stumble upon the cockroach
I'm not doing most, but if you know you know
But what shit do you know?
[Outro: Denzel Curry & Kid Cudi]
All on the street talk about me
Dot da genius, baby
Now that you see that I am caught, you want to get out of Membed
