5 Lyrics stars ["5 stars" letter]

[Intro: Jesus Navarro]
You can say that you are fine
That since I am not
You pass it more bastard
You say it's better than me
But who asked you? Who asked you? Eh

[Pre-car: sech]
I don't know who or what are you pretending for
I am not pending what you are doing
You are just a memory
I don't even look at your stories
If you were happy as you say ', ma
You weren't presuming Na '
Do not deceive me
[Chorus: Jesus Navarro & Sech]
I know you spend with him from hotel in hotel
I lowered you a million stars
He bought you with five of them
Yesterday in his Panamera I saw you
And I have to admit
That you looked just as Bella
I know you spend with him from hotel in hotel
I lowered you a million stars
And he bought you with five of them
Yesterday in his Panamera I saw you
And I have to admit
You looked just as Bella (AH-AH)
But not happy

[Verse: sech]
I go here looking for you
But not to you ', but to take a tea
And since I just found you
I didn't ask you for the float when in the lake I 'thus drowning me
Love had me 'fuck'
More to'a the shit that I got '
You were like a house for rent '
And he put 'in something that was never mine (no, no)
It made me ice to 'your cold
I was with toa 'the stone' of that river
If with the fall 'one learns, I fall
And even if it is without teeth, I smile
I'm so high that I turned off the Blunt
The open waze without location
An hour with the same song, Yeah
Wanting to make love without love
