The Way Of Mary Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know a couple of kids
With their minds on class As
And the jangly riffs
And a touch of cocaine
Makes them numb at their lips, it's true

They say
That I'm just the same
I'm out all the time
With the sweet Mary Jane
She's chillin' me out
So I just won't complain
She's true
[Pre-Chorus]
I must have heard a dozen times
I must have heard a dozen times
I don't care
She won't make me lose my mind
She won't make me lose my

[Chorus]
It's the way
It's the way
It's the way that she makes me
Tell her my problems
Makes it all okay
It's the way

[Verse 2]
She takes my thoughts away
Her scent it numbs my brain
And the words she talks
She only talks to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I must have heard a dozen times
I must have heard a dozen times
I don't care
She won't make me lose my mind
She won't make me lose my
You might also like[Chorus]
It's the way
It's the way
It's the way that she makes me
Tell her my problems
Makes it all okay
It's the way


[Bridge]
You won't see me, again
You won't see me, again
You won't see me, again
You won't see me, again

[Chorus]
It's the way
It's the way
It's the way that she makes me
Tell her my problems
Makes it all okay
It's the wayEmbed
