The Melody Lyrics[Intro]
But now, love is so much better
And Lord knows, if my words don't come together
Just listen to the melody
Cause my love
Is in there"

"Just listen to the melody"
"Just listen to the melody"
"Just listen to the melody"
"Just listen to the melody"
"Baby"
[Verse 1: Journalist 103]
Yo what's the deal love?
I know it's been a minute
Since I set aside time just for us to kick it
But you know how it is in this biz
You gotta go and make paper from these numerous gigs
But, you the reason why I keep it going
The threshold to my honor
A privilege that I'm blessed to know and
Even through rain, hell or snow and
Regardless to the stress you still push to keep the love flowing
I done had a share of love that done came and went
Lacking the patience it takes to build an establishment
You like a diamond in the rough to a cave of wonders
You got the treasure that could split a man's heart asunder
When the world starts to rain and thunder
You're the bridge of support that I go and seek shelter under
From cold winters to the hot summers
You're the love that I cherish that be
There ain't no need to wonder

[Hook: Journalist 103 (sample)]
If you think I ain't feeling your scene
I urge you by all means just, (just listen to the melody)
When you think the communication is low
And you just wanna know just, (just listen to the melody)
When you wondering if I ever miss you
Whenever I'm not with you just, (just listen to the melody)
And that's my word, regardless to our problems in the world
Just know that you gon' always be my (baby)

We disagree on a lot of topics
But life itself is a test sometimes you gotta weigh your options
I use a vision that's microscopic
When it comes to our family's future within a world of carnage
I never thought I could cherish something that's special
So I thank my Lord on the daily that He wrote to send you
And my life as my wife, I never would've guessed it
You be the blessing of foundation that's manifested
I know at times we done gave each other some drama
But the making of process made me a father
A gift I could never trade
The best thing you can have in this life
By me within the last days
This is just a beginning phase
Of what's to come as we strive together
Seeking the Lord's face
You my Khadijah, I wouldn't want to be without it
You my completion of life and that's without a doubt

[Hook: Journalist 103 (sample)]
If you think I ain't feeling your scene
I urge you by all means just, (just listen to the melody)
When you think the communication is low
And you just wanna know just, (just listen to the melody)
When you wondering if I ever miss you
Whenever I'm not with you just, (just listen to the melody)
And that's my word, regardless to our problems in the world
Just know that you gon' always be my (baby)
