Movie Star Lyrics[Intro: The Veronicas]
More than a movie star

[Verse 1: FR33SOL]
Yeah
Straight out the dirt, yeah (Dirt)
Now we bloomin' like a flower
Yeah, we been hurt
Sometimes we got dogged
But now we risin' to our power (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, together we claim what is ours
Infinite love in abundance
Like the blessings, rainin' showers
Had to open up my heart space
There wasn't many I could trust
'Cause normally I learn the hard way
When it come down to love
Healin' all these battle scars, babе
I can't lie, made me tough
And still, wе see with the stars, babe
We goin' up
[Chorus: The Veronicas]
Fly around the world
Never comin' down
Afraid of bein' lost
Scared of bein' found
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by your name
You still believe my love's only for your fame
But I know you're lonely in that crowd
I know those friends have let you down
Nobody will know who you really are
But to me, you were more than a movie star (Star)

[Verse 2: Lavva]
You don't gotta shrink around me, no, no
'Cause I enjoy your sincerity, ooh, yeah
A little too rough, but it's seeing better
Shining like some motion light beams
Way more than a role
Your spirit is golden
And I know you're chosen
But I never folded
Way more than a role
I know you're chosen
But you're still my best friend
You might also like[Chorus: The Veronicas]
Fly around the world
Never comin' down
Afraid of bein' lost
Scared of bein' found
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by your name
You still believe my love's only for your fame
But I know you're lonely in that crowd
I know those friends have let you down
Nobody will know who you really are
But to me, you were more than a movie star (Star)

[Bridge: The Veronicas]
I was right next to you
When you had nothing to lose
When all I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
I was right next to you
When you had so much to prove
When all I wanted was you
All I wanted was—

[Chorus: The Veronicas]
Fly around the world
Never comin' down (Comin' down)
Afraid of bein' lost
Scared of bein' found
Blinded by the lights (By the lights)
Blinded by your name (By your name)
You still believe my love's only for your fame
But I know you're lonely in that crowd (Know you're lonely)
I know those friends have let you down (Have let you down)
Nobody will know who you really are
But to me, you were more than a movie star (Star)
[Outro: The Veronicas]
Movie star
But to me, you were more than a movie star (Star)
More than a movie star (Movie star)
But to me, you were more than a movie starEmbed
