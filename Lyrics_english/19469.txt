Hello Lyrics[Chorus: Living in Fiction]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

[Verse 1: YONAS & Living in Fiction]
Lets go (Hello)
I call, but you don't answer so I write this open letter
When I left, the world was broken, I just hope its gotten better
Y'all argue who's the greatest, I left quotes for y'all to measure
Y'all were focused on who's clever, I was focused on forever (Hello)
Back when I would rock the hand me downs with holes inside my sweater
Thrift store shoppin' like I dove inside some treasure (Woo!)
Way before the Ben Haggerty's on these magazines
I was an average teen, not thinking bout this thing called rap (Hello)
'Cause there's this thing called white
And there's this thing called black
And there's this thing called life
And I think we're all attached
It's funny how my train of thought runs on these things called tracks
Marty McFly, I'm in the future tryna bring y'all back (Hello)
Pick it up and slam it down, that's just how the game goes
Telephone, telephone, I just hear the same tones
Where I’m from, it’s not too often that we see them rainbows
So we let the rain flow, then we change clothes
[Pre-Chorus: Living in Fiction & YONAS]
There's such a difference (Woo!)
Between us
And a million miles (That's right, we gon' get 'em with this one)

[Chorus: Living in Fiction & YONAS]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times (I just wanna call, baby I just wanna call)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

[Verse 2: YONAS]
Yeah, uh (Lets get 'em on this one)
Yeah (Hello)
Aw man, how could this just be a hobby
Five whole hours they been waitin' in the lobby
They callin' me a hero and I’m thinkin', "How could I be?"
All I wanted was a million and a two door Maserati (Hello)
But somewhere in my stride, we just started changin' lives
You think I’m changin' yours, but you really changin' mine
From here to overseas, they put belief in my designs
It's gettin' deep, I feel the world is tryna sneak inside my mind (Hello)
It's harder to define than artistry and rhyme
It seems like our journey is partially divine
I still have days where it isn’t all sublime
Even though I’m on the grind, I gotta slow up for the signs (Hello)
And recently I’m seein' that it’s more than just emceein'
When my homie has a son but needs court orders just to see him
A generation troubled and I just wanna free ‘em
Before machines are looking at human beings inside a museum
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Living In Fiction & YONAS]
It's no secret (Woo!)
That the parts of us
Are running out of time (We got 'em)

[Chorus: Living in Fiction & YONAS]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times (I just wanna call, baby I just wanna call)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be homeEmbed
