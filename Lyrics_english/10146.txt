TranslationsPortuguêsPerfect Lie Lyrics[Intro]
Dun dun, dun-dun-dun, dun dun dun dun dun
Dun dun, dun-dun-dun, dun dun dun dun dun
Dun dun, dun-dun-dun, dun dun dun dun dun

[Verse 1]
Neck aches and my back might break
I'm scared of the future, like everybody else
Handshakes on a highway that takes us straight to the grave
It's the secret that sells (Shh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody fakes it 'til they make it
Everybody loves it 'til they hate it

[Chorus]
La-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lie, I'll sing it 'til I cry tonight
La-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lie, I'll taste it just the one more time
I'll try to love without hating you
I'll try to blink without losing you
I'll try to leave without missing you

[Post-Chorus]
I can tell a perfect liе
(I can tell a perfect liе)
(I can tell a perfect lie)

[Verse 2]
Mistakes are the stories that take us straight to the stage
It's the heartaches that sells
Strange brain, take a look at my cage
You'll see, all I care about is feeding myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody fakes it 'til they make it
Everybody loves it 'til they hate it
You might also like[Chorus]
La-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lie, I'll sing it 'til I cry tonight
La-la-lie, la-la-la-la-lie, I'll taste it just the one more time
I'll try to love without hating you
I'll try to blink without losing you
I'll try to leave without missing you

[Post-Chorus]
I can tell a perfect lie
I can tell a perfect lie (I can tell a perfect lie)
I can tell a perfect lie (I can tell a perfect lie)
(I can tell a perfect lie)
(I can tell a perfect lie)

[Outro]
Dun dun, dun-dun-dun, dun dun dun dun dun
