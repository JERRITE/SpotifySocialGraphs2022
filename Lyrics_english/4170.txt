CERITICOMIO LYRICS [Lyrics of "asylum"]

[Intro]
They say that I blur
They comment that your crazy
Share a crazy vest
Everyone with whom it is

[Chorus]
A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood
A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood

[Verse 1]
This is a love villas, Castillas and pills
I of urbanization and you my richitilla
In the street it is rumored that I have a gang
And for your parents I am the nightmare

Smoking box office until the sun shines
Going around the old San Juan in the Tundra
With Mista and Maxi, Super Relaxy
You feel that you are in another galaxy

Well and healthy, they ask in Capestrano
As a madman you can win to 'what I win
And as a woman of your level you can even fix
In a man who is bipolar and with a mental failure

[Pre-car]
Disa me ma ', that you ta' put pa 'mi
As I am willing for you
They are two crazy in the world
From the second I met you
You might also liked ma ', that your ta' put pa 'mi
As I am willing for you
They are two crazy in the world
From the second I met you

[Chorus]
A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood

A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood

[Verse 2]
A love of Klonopin, Xanax, to buy in Sax
The show contracts continue to arrive by fax
And while Sature and La Plata account, it lasts
The doctors do not find the medicine that heals me

I your crazy and my crazy, nobody is wrong
There are no lies here in the mouth
I delete tape but I am not seen in the INTA
I fell in love since I saw your photo in Insta
I call you, we fight, we always fix
It is a love of asylum what we both carry
Indicate, before I diagnose
And another case formulate me or manufactures it

[Pre-car]
Disa me ma ', that you ta' put pa 'mi
As I am willing for you
They are two crazy in the world
From the second I met you

Disa me ma ', that you ta' put pa 'mi
As I am willing for you
They are two crazy in the world
From the second I met you

[Chorus]
A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood

A asylum love
Of those that cause me insomnia
Of those that nobody understands
But between you and me it is understood
