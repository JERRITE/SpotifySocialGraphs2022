Very happy lyrics ["very happy" letter]]

[Intro: Silvestre Dangond, Ñejo & Nicky Jam]
I got up happy even if I don't have money
Para-pa-pa-pam-pam
This is the remix
You know 'how is it

[Choir: Ñejo & Silvestre Dangond, both]
I feel music inside me
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Today I got up from the most 'Feli'
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Tell me if the same thing happens to you
And it's like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
I hope that the world feels like this
Happy, pa 'ti, pa' me
I feel music inside me
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Today I got up from the most 'Feli'
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Tell me if the same thing happens to you
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
I hope that the world feels like this
Happy pa 'ti, pa' me
[Verse 1: Nicky Jam]
Of pr pa 'rd, of rd pa' medallo
Today love 'in the neighborhood
With my good good pa 'that the balance' on the weekend
The rumba here never ends
And if you see her tell him that I arrived
Let him know that I want to see her to have a good time
Pa 'dance glue', knows 'that e' mine
Andamo 'Fiesta, Rulay with mine'
What is for today does not leave it 'pa' later
Take Mazucamba as Tego says
So Happy, so fresh, already knows 'how e'
Reggaeton for the world to activate and 'everything asks
God bless that 'single mamacita'
That run through hers and they are not left (they are not left)

[Verse 2: ñejo]
Ho-today-today I got up from the most 'feli' (more 'feli')
More happy that a Lombri '(a Lombri')
Nor ask me 'what did I get
When the 'guard' arrived, I quickly hid
Like when I was in Kinder
That the only problem was to choose the taste of a limber
Toíto 'was limber
I remember my grandmother by throwing me the blessing
That goes with Dio 'and the virgin
When the bell was the house of the 'doll'
A little of kidspirito
And when I have 'a thousand problem'
Write it 'on paper, with a light' burns'
Today I feel good Happy
I would like to give a thousand kiss' to my 'nephew', mami and daddy
And the one who comes negative, does not make him 'case
Better give it a hug, that there is no delay (delay)

And if I still don't feel 'the congratulations'
Then 'give the song pawrá', pa-pa-pa'trá
If you still don't feel 'congratulated'
Then 'give the song pawrá', pa-pa—

[Choir: Silvestre Dangond & Ñejo]
Today I got up from the happiest
With winning the parranda
And I slept in a juico town to you
Arrive 'like four batch' (to the pan)
Tell me if the same thing happens to you
And it's like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
I hope that the world feels like this
Happy pa 'ti, pa' me
I feel music inside me
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Today I got up from the most 'Feli'
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Tell me if the same thing happens to you
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
I hope that the world feels like this
Feli ', pa' ti, pa 'me

[Verse 3: Silvestre Dangond]
I got up happy even if I don't have money (and what?)
And I will hesitate with Ñejo until tomorrow (turn on the stove!)
So serve, 'fill it
Pass it, I roll up, delay it to '
Let's go, soleman '
Forgive, I don't endure the desire, my love
[Interlude: Ñejo]
Feliz Feliz
Put it at Christmas'

[Chorus: Ñejo]
I feel music inside me
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Today I got up from the most 'Feli'
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
Tell me if the same thing happens to you
E 'like a: "para-pa-pa-pam-pam"
I hope that the world feels like this
Feli ', pa' ti, pa 'mymbed
