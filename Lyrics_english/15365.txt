This Cold Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't need a ride to arrive
I don't feel approached any time

[Chorus 1]
If you feel a fader on a decline
Out of all you've ever been and you won't need time, you never need time

[Verse 2]
I don't need this every God
You see every ghost am I
[Chorus 2]
Have we found a phase to be out of
Transfer all your thoughts to me and you won't need love, we don't need love

[Verse 3]
I don't need this sin to go
Down to where all forevers flow

[Chorus 3]
Every faith released is revealed slow
Never talking back to me, say it out loud, say it out loud

[Outro]
I feel this cold
I never stay and I never go
I feel this cold
I never stay and I never goYou might also like1Embed
