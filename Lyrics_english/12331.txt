Die MF Die Lyrics[Intro]
Die!

[Verse]
I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do?

I don't need your resistance
I don't need your prayers
I don't need no religion
Run away, away from you!
I don't do what I've been told
You're so lame why don't you just go?

[Chorus]
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!

[Verse]
I don't need your present
I don't need your pray
I don't need your decision
So what should I do?

I don't need your approval
I don't need your hope
I don't need your lecture
Run away, away from you!

I'll be sorry when I'll go?
You're so full of shit man just go!

[Chorus]
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!
