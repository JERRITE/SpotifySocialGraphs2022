Love Die Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
What happens when it's over?
When we've breathed our last breath
And we've loved each other to death?
Can you tell me what happens?

[Verse 2]
I wonder where the love goes
When pleasure turns to pain
When the memories fade away
Can you tell me what happens?
[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers in your hair now on our grave
A little bit of pressure's all it takes
Should've known we'd shatter that we'd break, break
Maybe I'm the one that we should blame
For never thinking we'd end up this way
I don't need answers I need you to stay, stay

[Chorus]
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone
Then let it be you

[Verse 3]
In my dreams, we're growing older
But I wake up to the truth
That I'm scared we're gonna lose
Tell me it won't happen

[Verse 4]
So before it's really over
Can we have a little faith?
Baby, say it ain't too late
It's all that I'm asking
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm the one that we should blame
For never thinking we'd end up this way
I don't need answers I need you to stay, stay

[Chorus]
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone
Then let it be you

[Bridge]
Please don't let it die
Please don't let it die
Please don't let it die young, oh whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers in your hair now on our grave
A little bit of pressure's all it takes
Should've known we'd shatter, that we'd break

[Chorus]
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone (Love someone)
Then let it be you3Embed
