My Hero Lyrics[Verse 1]
Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
[Verse 2]
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Bridge]
Kudos, my hero
Leaving all the mess
You know my hero
The one that's on

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinaryYou might also like38Embed
