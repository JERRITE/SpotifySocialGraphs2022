Respectfully Lyrics[Intro]
(Why your face so ugly?)

[Chorus: Queendom Come]
Four bitches, three yellow, one chocolate
Head down, keep that pussy poppin', yeah
It's the bank account for me
Bad bitch, I ain't doin' shit for free
Ever, I don't know why I'm like this
I got finessed once, I used to be a nice bitch
Yeah, yeah, now it's dollar signs and no bitch can check me
Fuck all you hoes, respectfully (Bitch)
[Verse 1: Big Jade]
Where them hoes at that was talkin' down?
Somewhere broke gettin' fucked (Bitch)
Where them niggas at that was hatin' on me?
Somewhere mad gettin' ducked (For real)
Fuck your ex-bitch, I'm your next bitch
Pull up, zoom zoom, check, sis
Money up and I'm flexin'
I got NFO on my necklace (Ayy)
Goin' hard for my gang
Better put Big in front of my name
I put some diamonds inside of my veins
I got some money, don't fuck him the same (Nah)
Boss bitch, no handout (No handout)
Talk shit, bring the vans out (Vans out)
One call, bring my mans out
Rockstar, bring the band out

[Chorus: Queendom Come]
Four bitches, three yellow, one chocolate
Head down, keep that pussy poppin', yeah
It's the bank account for me
Bad bitch, I ain't doin' shit for free
Ever, I don't know why I'm like this
I got finessed once, I used to be a nice bitch
Yeah, yeah, now it's dollar signs and no bitch can check me
Fuck all you hoes, respectfully (Man, BeatKing)

I can't fuck with broke bitches, dick up in your throat (Woah)
Club Godzilla, I ain't trickin' on no ho (Nope)
Bitch, I'm out the H, grape, mix it with a four
Get the ass, hit my dance, then I'm dippin' on that ho (Hold up)
Pop that ass on me, I got cash on me (Ooh, ooh)
Do the dash, Lam', I drive fast on 'em (Zoom, zoom)
Fuckin' for no cash, she a crash dummy (Toss, toss)
NFO Gang, we the new Cash Money (Club God)

[Chorus: Queendom Come]
Four bitches, three yellow, one chocolate

I got finessed once, I used to be a nice bitch
Yeah, yeah, now it's dollar signs and no bitch can check me
Fuck all you hoes, respectfully1Embed
