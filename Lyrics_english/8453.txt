[Pre-car]
I don't know if it's a coincidence that I feel like this
Whenever you are close to me
Tell me what did you do to me, what drug you gave me
That since that night I am not the same
You look at me 'and I start to sweat
I feel I can fly
[Chorus]
Baby, the note is already taking effect
My world is fucking 'and I feel perfect
Because you are, here, moving like that, don't stop '
Baby, you are my drug, tonight I don't get off '
Because the note is already doing effect
My world is fucking 'and I feel perfect
Because you are, here, moving like that, don't stop '
Baby, you are my drug, tonight I don't get off '

[Verse]
The kitten of yours lost you due to negligence
And I don't believe in abstinence
Tonight in bed there will be turbulence '
How rich you mama ', you will give you the permanence'
That totito and 'the eminence
Pa 'give it I have licensed
Since it fell 'to Florence
He got more bicha, but does not lose the essence
No, no, from Carola
No, no, no, don't go alone
No, no, don't say '"Hello"
Or it will be another pa 'the tail
Your picket cool me
I am a fan of that popola (Mua, Mua)
Plus the picky, endo, coca and the rola (more)
It is you who controls me, huh (hehe)
