â€‹Two Faced Lyrics[Verse 1]
I put a smile on my face
No matter how I feel
Even if I'm sinking
Can't be dropping tears
Ain't a boy I'm a man now
Soon to be a star
In due time, in due time

[Verse 2]
What was the purpose of
Doing all the things that I did
Tryna grow for what reason
I wish, I wish I knew
I'm used to tightening my neck
So I won't stand out
But now I've come too far
I wish

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could convey how I feel
Distort it and confuse how I feel
What it feels to be in love
How I feel, how I feel

[Chorus]
What does it take to be right
How bad it hurts to be wrong
I've had a mask for so long
I lost the touch to be real

What does it take to be right
How bad it hurts to be wrong
I've had a mask for so long
I lost the touch to be real

[Post-Chorus]
Is there someone who I can
Trust enough to say who I am
I know that I'm weird sometimes
But I wish somebody knew this side of me
You might also likeKnew this side of me
Knew this side of me
Knew this side of me
Of me, of me

[Verse 3]
There are a couple moments
Where I wanna look back
And I'm just thinking
"If I made the right choices
Would it be right, would it be right"

I wish, I could, I would

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could convey how I feel
Distort it and confuse how I feel
What it feels to be in love
How I feel, how I feel

[Chorus]
What does it take to be right
How bad it hurts to be wrong
I've had a mask for so long
I lost the touch to be real
What does it take to be right
How bad it hurts to be wrong
I've had a mask for so long
I lost the touch to be real

[Post-Chorus]
Is there someone who I can
Trust enough to say who I am
I know that I'm weird sometimes
But I wish somebody knew this side of me

Knew this side of me
Knew this side of me
Knew this side of me
Of me, of me2Embed
