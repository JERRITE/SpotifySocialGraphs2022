PLEASE LYRICS ["PLEASE LAME"

[Verse 1]
The moon is an orange of carmine color at midnight
Barefoot behind the window, seeing Madrid the Nuit, Gulf and Canalla
Motorcycles, Rock 'N' roll, leather, studs and alcohol
What are you doing? Now I try that the heart
Which is a large steel dock does not get out of my chest
I need you, you see, I hate recognizing
That I need to have your breath to be fine
That there is no better food than the one you give me with your kisses
[Chorus]
Please call, I'm a zero to the left
I am a balloon without gas, a ship on the high seas without pattern, drifting
Please call, I'm so helpless
I lack will, I can't concentrate and I don't find the exit, no

[Verse 2]
The radio with its proposals for a happy world confronted me
A thousand follies pass me through my head that I do not take into account
And although it hurts this time, I have to recognize
That I need to have your body to be fine
In love, lost, my mind needs you

[Chorus]
Please call, I'm a zero to the left
I am a balloon without gas, a ship on the high seas without pattern, drifting
Please call, I'm so helpless
I lack will, I can't concentrate and I don't find the exit, no

[The end]
Please call, I'm a zero to the left
I am a balloon without gas, a ship on the high seas without a patron, to drift Might Also Likeembed
