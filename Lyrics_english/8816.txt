Nightclubbing Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see

[Chorus]
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?
[Verse 2]
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb

[Chorus]
When we're Nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?You might also like3Embed
