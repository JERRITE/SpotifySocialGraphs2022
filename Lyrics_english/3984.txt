[Enter: J Balvin & Bad Bunny]
J Balvin
Ba-Bad Bunny
LEGO, LEGO, LEGO
I live day and night thinking about you
And you wasting time with him (Skrt, Skrt)
Tell me where are you that I want to see you, Yeh

[Chorus: J Balvin, Bad Bunny]
If your boyfriend leaves you alone
Tell me and I went looking for you
Only a couple of hours will be enough (Ajá)
And that bastard is not going to recover
If your boyfriend leaves you alone (alone)
Tell me and I went looking for you
Only a couple of hours will suffice me (LEGO)
And that bastard is not going to recover (RRRUAH)
[Verse 1: bad bunny]
Such a ass is not found on eBay
This bug is yours, I have it in Layaway
Is more none has Brake
I'm not a pitcher, but I'm going to make you double play
I know you're fine, but in bed Sasha Gray
Smoking and drinking Gray
Sorry for Casper, but J-Lo leaves with Drake
I take you for New York a weekend
A dust before bedtime, another in the morning
There is a jet of fools who have you wins'
But tell them you are from the king like wool

[Pre-stribe: Bad Bunny]
I always mistreat me
Seeing your videos and your portrait
Tell your boyfriend that the contract was already defeated
With me are from wax, the outburst ', Yeh

[Chorus: j Balvin & Bad Bunny]
If your boyfriend leaves you alone
Tell me and I went looking for you
Only a couple of hours will suffice me
And that bastard is not going to recover
If your boyfriend leaves you alone (EH-EH-EH)
Tell me and I went looking for you
Only a couple of hours will suffice me
And that bastard is not going to recover, Yeh (Lego)

Tell him, he always knows when and where is it
He brought other friends who have boyfriend too
Every time I play her cat and fall where daddy
When I miss me and wants me to get surprise you arrive in Medellín
With him you always lose, with me win
I think about all day well Nasty
Thousands of women, thousands in bottles
There is no chimba if you are not here
Tell the truth to that
That does not give the levels
And to see if you can

[Bridge: J Balvin, Bad Bunny]
To your jevo (to your jevo)
Avise him (Avise him)
That this weekend
You pass it with to 'your panas and not with him
I don't play (I don't play)
Avise him (Avise him)
That you found replacement
And wait for a while (Yeh-EH-EH)

[Chorus: j Balvin & Bad Bunny]
If your boyfriend leaves you alone
Tell me and I went looking for you
Only a couple of hours will suffice me
And that bastard is not going to recover, Yeh
If your boyfriend leaves you alone (Bad Bunny)
Tell me and I went looking for you (the bad rabbit)
Only a couple of hours will suffice me (J Balvin, Man)
And that bastard is not going to recover
