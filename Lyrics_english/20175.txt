Pumpkins Scream in the Dead of Night Lyrics[Intro]
Gaspare, what the hell you doin'?

[Verse 1: Savage Ga$p]
I just had to do it on my own shit
I just had to do her on some cold shit
I just got these bitches in my cold grip
Know you see me lookin’ like a ghost, bitch
Ayy, like a ghost, bitch
I just seen 'em lookin' when I rode in
Ayy, on some ho shit
I just hit it once and then that ho dipped (Dipped)
Young Jack in the back, ho (In the back)
I been in the cut, lookin’ spooky in a black coat (Bitch)
And she fuckin' with my tats though
I don't know her name but I just know I'm finna clap though, ayy
[Chorus: Savage Ga$p]
Look, don't know her
I'm just finna glow, October
Ayy, don't know her
Boy, I'm finna glow, October

[Verse 2: Savage Ga$p]
Look, and I been gettin’ bands, no Green Day
I been fuckin’ geeked off a bean for a week straight (Uh)
Gasp, 93, here to team play
Catch me in a graveyard, posted where the fiends stay, look
Ayy, and I'm up in her guts, no Berserk (Ayy, yuh)
Got these bitches jumpin’ out they T-shirt
And I just got a chain for my bro
And I'm finna get my own, but my brothers gotta eat first (Ugh)
Look, and I don't text hoes
I'm just in their mouth like strep throat
And I don’t even really wanna feel it
Shinigami told me, "Kill 'em," I said, "Let me grab my death note"

[Chorus: Savage Ga$p]
Ayy, don't know her
Boy, I'm finna glow, October
Look, don't know her
Boy, I'm finna glow, October

October (Bitch), it's a nightmare
Feelin' like Jack, I'm a king, you're a poser (You're a poser)
Fuck out the way, if you see me, move over
If you can't hear me, lil' bitch, move closer (Damn)
Yuh, and you can't see me, I'm a ghost
Got this smoke in my throat
Can't feel my face, I'm 'boutta choke ('Boutta choke)
I been on the road, fuck the pressure, I won't fold
I been chillin' with Gasper on Winterhill, and it's cold (Bitch)
I don't listen for shit, I don't ever do what I'm told (Bitch)
That's why these labels are tired 'cause I just can't be controlled (Bitch)
I got chains on my body, lookin' partly decomposed
Bloody ice on my wrist, like Subzero, I'm froze, bitch (I'm froze, bitch)10Embed
