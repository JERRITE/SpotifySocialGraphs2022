Lonely with Me Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, you should never be lonely
But baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me

[Verse 1]
Check one, two radio
East coast, West coast
Gulf Shore, Midwest
Maine down to Texas
Deep south, up north
L.A., New York
I'll be there wherever you are
Yes because I'm only breathing when you're near me
Girl your touch keeps my heart beating
Anytime you ever need me
I'll be there wherever you are
[Chorus]
Baby, you should never be lonely
Baby, you should never be lonely
But baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me
And I don't ever want you to worry
I can run to you in a hurry
So baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me

[Verse 2]
You could be in
London, Rio
Paris, Tokyo
Dubai, Beijing
Rome to the Phillippines
Sydney, Kenya
Mexico to Canada
I'll be there wherever you are

Cause there's nothing that they can do
That's ever gonna stop me from getting you, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, you should never be lonely
Baby, you should never be lonely
But baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me
And I don't ever want you to worry
I can run to you in a hurry
So baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me
You might also like[Bridge]
And I know it's a little bit crazy
But I'm just trying to cover my bases
I don't care where in the world you are
Cause you know that it's not too far

[Chorus]
Baby, you should never be lonely
Baby, if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me
Baby, you should never be lonely
Baby, you should never be lonely
But baby if you're gonna be lonely
Be lonely with me
(Be lonely with me, girl)
And I don't ever want you to worry (no no)
I can run to you in a hurry
(Don't you worry bout a thing)
So baby if you're gonna be lonely
(Won't you be lonely with me?)
Be lonely with me

[Outro]
Gotta be lonely with me
We can runaway on this dream
Get up and make your getaway1Embed
