LOVE TO LOVE LYRICS [LETTER OF "LOVE YOU"]

[Verse 1]
I'm always in a hurry against the clock
Everything I lived was never for me
And although it hurts to accept it, it is so

[Verse 2]
Nonsense separate us both
An endless story is repeated again
And I know that I am part of you
[Pre-car]
Because after your love there is nothing
And I recognize fear in your gaze

[Chorus]
Because I always fall asleep when you call me
Because at every minute I miss you again
You are for me, since I saw you I don't stop thinking
And I am so afraid to love you again

[Verse 3]
I would bet again on this love
To lose reason, it's you illusion
That catch my heart

[Pre-car]
Because after your love there is nothing
And I recognize fear in your gaze

[Chorus]
Because I always fall asleep when you call me
Because at every minute I miss you again
You are for me, since I saw you I don't stop thinking
And I am so afraid to love you again

[Chorus]
Because I always fall asleep when you call me
Because at every minute I miss you again
You are for me, since I saw you I don't stop thinking
And I am so afraid
I have so much, so afraid of returning to Yoyou Might Also Likeembed
