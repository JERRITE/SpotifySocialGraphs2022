Lions Inside Lyrics[Verse 1:]
If you leave me to my own device
I never had to compromise
This city’s like a jungle
Gotta make it mine
Put my fears right out of sight
Beat the hustle better get it right
In a game where the strong survive
Only the strong survive

[Chorus:]
These chains will not hold me down
They’ll break and fall to the ground
Can't tame these lions inside
The Power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight
These Lions inside
These Lions inside
Ohhh Ohhh Ohh
These Lions inside
Ohhh Ohhh Ohh
These Lions inside

[Verse 2:]
I had to learn to be the hero
I started only here from zero
In a city like a jungle I had to get mine
Never give you gotta take
Be the catapult to storm the gates
Cuz a champion is never giving in
Seeing thru to till the end of days
Till the end of days

[Chorus:]
These chains will not hold me down
They’ll break and fall to the ground
Can't tame these lions inside
The Power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight
These Lions inside
These Lions inside

Ohhh Ohhh Ohh
Can't tame these lions inside
Ohhh Ohhh Ohh
Can't tame these lions inside

The ground that they’re walking ain’t cutting thru this skin
Hunt down their prey till the bitter end
The ground that they’re walking ain’t cutting thru this skin
Hunt down their prey till the bitter end
The ground that they’re walking ain’t cutting thru this skin
Hunt down their prey let the games begin

[Chorus:]
These chains will not hold me down
They’ll break and fall to the ground
Can't tame these lions inside
The Power is reigning like
Thunder ready for a fight
These Lions inside
