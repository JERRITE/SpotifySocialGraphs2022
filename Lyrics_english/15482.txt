Color Esperanza / I only ask God (Mexico) Lyrics [Lyrics for "Color Esperanza / I only ask God (Mexico version)"]

HE
What's in your eyes just looking
That you are tired of walking and walking
And walk, always turning in a place

HE
That the windows can be opened
Changing the air depends on you
It will help you, it is worth once again
Know what you can, want to be
Remove your fears, get them out
Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart

It is
Better to get ever embark
Better try to stop trying
Although you see, it's not so easy to start

And
That the impossible can be achieved
That sadness will one day go
And so it will be, life will change and change

Know what you can, want to be
Remove your fears, get them out
Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart

Know what you can, want to be
Remove your fears, get them out
Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart

It is better to shine
That just seek to see the sun
You might also like to ask God
That war is not indifferent to me
It is a big monster and stave strong
All poor people's innocence

I only ask God
That the unfair is not indifferent to me
Don't slap me the other cheek
After a claw scratched me this luck

Know that you can
Know that you can
Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart
