Hold Up Lyrics[Intro]
Red Drum on the beat
Thanks Ugly God

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I'm gonna count this guap-guap when I show up (Guap-guap)
She gon' give top-top 'til she throw up, I'ma
Pull up in a drop top, Fruit Roll-Up (Okay)
Don't call my phone get blocked-blocked, bitch, hold up
Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
The bih' blew up my phone, I told the bitch, wait, hold up
Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
The bih' blew up my phone, I told the bitch, wait, hold up
[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Big bag (Ooh), big green Peter Pan, ayy
Diamond chain (Uh-huh), left wrist 20 bands, hey
Bougie bitch (Wassup), clean nigga, dirty hands, wait
One mansion (Ooh), plenty bitches, bring a friend, ayy
And all these niggas mad wack
Runnin' with the sauce, bitch, give me my swag back (Bitch, give me my swag back)
When I up this pole, guarantee they back, back (Brr)
I'm a big dog, nigga, you a lab rat
And every time I touch that money I get flashbacks (I get, ooh)
But I just throw it at my bank and tell 'em add that (They add that)
I call your baby mama up, she gave me mad cat (Brr)
My chain piss yellow but my whip is matte black

[Chorus: Ugly God & Takeoff]
I'm gonna count this guap-guap when I show up (Guap-guap)
She gon' give top-top 'til she throw up, I'ma
Pull up in a drop top, Fruit Roll-Up (Okay)
Don't call my phone get blocked-blocked, bitch, hold up
Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
The bih' blew up my phone, I told the bitch, wait, hold up
Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
The bih' blew up my phone, I told the bitch, wait, hold up (Takeoff)

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Wait, wait a minute hold up (Hold up)
Lookin' for a bad bitch with no miles on her (Where?)
Daddy bought a brand new bag, James Brown on 'em (Daddy)
Control the bitch, I mute that ho', can't hear the sound on her (Shh)
Paper tag, here go the keys, you the Jag owner (Here)
Use these racks for all yo' needs, I'm the bag donor (Bag)
Ignore your calls, when you call, make you sad, don't it? (Sad)
Ignore my call, when I call, I'ma spaz on you (Spaz)
It start to change, you got chains and some ass on you (Ass)
Bought you a chain, wit' ya' name, came with glass on it (Glass)
Thought you gon' run off wit' that bag, run up a tab on it (Uh-uh)
When I sag baguettes, I could be some diamonds or some cash on me (Uh-huh)

Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
The bih' blew up my phone, I told the bitch, wait, hold up
Hold up, wait, hold up (Wassup, wassup)
