[Intro: Damso & Noémie Lenoir]
Love
Sentimental (sentimental)
Yeah
Han

[Verse 1: Damso & Noémie Lenoir]
I'm waiting for it to rain
Let the rain confuse your tears, my sweats when you talk about us (yeah)
You are sulking
You imagined that one day, ring in hand, I would get on my knees (beg me, yeah)
[Pre-refrain: Damso]
But it's not that simple, love
We say it every day but it's not really true
It's not that simple, love
We say it every day without necessarily loving ourselves

[Refrain: Damso & Noémie Lenoir]
Sentimental (sentimental, yeah)
Sentimental, why is it so hard to kiss without being bad?
Without being bad?

[Bridge: Damso]
AIE Aie Aie
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch, Yeah-Eh-Eh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Damso & Noémie Lenoir]
Love (oh yes), what do I know, me, of love, his mother?
Twenty-seven years that I am around the sun, however, I still haven't seen the light
Five years we make you say: "I love you", however, still no ring with the annular
And then we are for a Go
From kisses to kiss, from midnight confidences, to simple parental exchanges
Separation (leave me)
And for those who say to themselves: "yes" in front of the family then divorce for not much
Precipitation (gently)

[Pre-refrain: Damso & Noémie Lenoir]
No, it's not so simple, love (no, no)
We say it every day but it's not really true (believe me)
No, it's not so simple, love (no, no, no)
We say it every day without necessarily loving ourselves (leave me)
