Merry Happy Lyrics [Verse 1]
Watching Me Like You Never Watch on One
Don't Tell Me That You Didn't Try And Check Out My Bum
CAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU DID
CAUSE YOUR FRIEND TOLD ME THAT YOU LIKED IT

Gave Me Those Pearls and I Thought They were ugly
Don't You Try To Tell Me That You Never Loved Me
I know that you did
CAUSE YOU SAID IT AND YOU WROTE IT Down
[Chorus]
Dancing at discs
Eating Cheese on Toast
Yeah You Make Me Merry, Make Me Very Very Happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around

Dancing at discs
Eating Cheese on Toast
Yeah You Make Me Merry, Make Me Very Very Happy
But you obviously, you didn't want to stick around

So i Learnt From You
Of the do do do do that

I can watch a sunset on my opera

Sitting in restaurants
THOUGHT WERE SO GROWN UP
But i know now that we were not the people
That we turned out to be
Chatting on the Phone, Can't Take Back Those Hours
But i won't regret
CAUSE YOU CAN GROW FLOWERS
From Where Dirt Used To Be

[Chorus]
