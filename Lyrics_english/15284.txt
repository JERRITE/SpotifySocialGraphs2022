Smoke Two Joints Lyrics[Intro]
She was living in a single room with three other individuals. One of them was a male and the other two, well, the other two were females. God only knows what they were up to in there. And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes... Reefers

[Verse 1]
I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more
[Interlude]
Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!
Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemilla
Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!
Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemill...
Eazy-E were ya ever caught slippin'?
Hell no!

[Verse 2]
Daddy, he once told me, "Son, you be hard workin' man"
And Momma, she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can"
But then, one day, I met a man who came to me and said:
"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head"

[Outro]
