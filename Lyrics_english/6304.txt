Caffeine Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeff Williams]
Listen up, strap in, notify your next of kin
You're about to take a ride a little on the blazing side
Guzzle down your Red Bull, you're gonna need a bucket full
You're watching me accelerate and tear apart the interstate
A certified monster, I'm an absolute trip
Like Otis Redding, hard to handle, so you better get a grip
Super fast, super fly, bonafide wise guy
Call the morgue and say goodbye, write your will, it's time to die

[Chorus: Jeff Williams with Casey Lee Williams]
Caffeine, I'm caffeine
Caffeine, I'm caffeine
I'm a bad dream
I'm a rad scene
I'm a tad mean
But I'm not afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out
[Verse 2: Casey Lee Williams]
I'm a cheetah on the plains, I'm the highway star
A supersonic princess in a million dollar car
Blood on fire pumpin' through my veins
Weavin' in and out while I'm boltin' through the lanes
I'm hyperdrive, overdrive, hit the gas at fifty-five
Break neck, trainwreck, in my presence, genuflect
Track roundin', speed-a-soundin', 'lectrifyin', pulse-poundin'
Heart-pumpin', brain-thumpin', watch me get the party jumpin'

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams with Jeff Williams]
Caffeine, I'm caffeine
Caffeine, I'm caffeine
I'm a bad dream
I'm a rad scene
I'm a tad mean
But I'm not afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out

[Verse 3: Lamar Hall]
Yo, listen up, I hope you like it hot
Grab yourself a mug 'cause I made a fresh pot
Come and get a dose of my kickass java
Fuelin' your addiction with this thick black lava
We can do up an espresso, or the cappuccino way
Sure to get your fix, venti or grande
Sugar, Splenda, Equal, maybe Sweet'N Low
Everybody's happy when they hangin' with Joe, let's go

Caffeine, I'm caffeine
I'm caffeine, yow! Caffeine
I'm a bad dream (Yeah)
I'm a rad scene (Yeah)
I'm a tad mean (Yeah)
But I'm not afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out (Afraid to take you out)
Afraid to take you out8Embed
