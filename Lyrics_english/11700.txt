[Verse: Kizaru & Big Baby Tape]
I Say “One-Two”, Say “One-Two-Three”
Ho, you didn't know, I'm from SPB
These rappers are all like mini-we
Everything has changed today, it's hard to be g
Yes, it was an ordinary day, I remember this as yesterday
Mood Homicide from morning to evening
We sat with him, and yes, we thought for a couple
I remember how he told me: “Hey, you, kizaru!
I came to an idea - let's throw a plug, take everything from him
And we will check it Playa "
Check it OG, check it g
Shit, let's come to him while he is sleeping (e)
No, I can't wait, let's drop it door
Although no, let's drop a whole yard
Tip has a cut, ready to meet them point blank
They ask for mercy, but I translated the shutter
Run, take everything, take our feet
An inconspicuous Logan will wait for a continuous on the road
(E, e) and what in the end? We have a nalik, a dop, took all the prey, oka-docks
I click on the floor, and we fly on the oncoming
They just sent all these opponents to eternity
When we are in duo, something happens
Plag Bulk in the mouth - this life is so fleeting
I looked for a while - this is time to make numbers
I say on codes - they do not understand these ciphers
This is rarely - we are white tigers
He shot him like a frame in his film - these are the credits (oh shit)
Bingo, we smoke indo, these whites do not understand my lingo
These kids play games-Simple-Dimple
I played with bitches, sorry, mom, I'm pimp’sal
She is lower and lower, but this is not a limbo
We smoke Cali Gas, Man, you smoke only dildo
Fo 'Shizzle, My Nizzle, I launched Missile in them
Kingpin Skinny Pimp - I'm Winner every Season
I fell in love with Nin, I can't finish Bang'
So that they go, yes, I had to run
Those who are not standing on this fall, like KELL
It’s hot on the quarter, was in Pekla itself
Forty -five degrees, demons fucking
I didn't even know that hell really
Who are you not sure, let him tell time
Come on, throw a plug - this is a good idea (idea) (what's the matter?)
How, how, Manny? And I went down to hell
I was met by the devil, and I made a pact with him
I smoke nectar, ho, I smoke an extract
Nike on my feet, walking in the sky - this is a fact
Y, and I Don'T Give A Fuck
The same Same Shit, new day - I moved Guap
I didn’t joke, I scattered, like, I made a frame
On the shoulder of the bandana-mafioso Don Dada (yes)
Talks about love, but I don't need it
Fuck her - Doggy Style, on dick lipstick
No, Ho, I'm not a prince, no, fucking, I'm not a gift
He flew to Browom to your block and brought up order Might Also Like33MBED
