How are you doing some time I heard
That time was very cruel
And that when it happens, that illusion takes
Intense with which something was born between two
But here that truth does not apply
It doesn't matter how much it goes from the beginning
Delirium herring, who get drunk
Since when I found you
How you do
To get around me every time
Take my world to law and the other way around
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To get through me whole no more
Make me see everything I am capable
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To be lost to us ...
I ever saw you and everything around me fell
I told you that it was like that
You know how to surprise, I know how to reveal a little more
But just a little more
I know here, the days will spend
No matter what goes from the beginning
Without breaking this delirium, which gets drunk
Since when I found you
How you do
To get around me every time
Take my world to law and the other way around
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To get through me whole no more
Make me see everything I am capable
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To be lost account
To start everything back
So that it has no end
How you do
To get around me every time
Take my world to law and the other way around
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To get through me whole no more
Make me see everything I am capable
Just feeling that you approach
How you do...
How you do...
How you do...
How you do
To get through me whole no more
Make me see everything I am capable
Just feeling that you approach
How you do
To be lost account
How you do
