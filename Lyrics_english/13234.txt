​swallowing stones LyricsSwallowing stones
On the way to your home
I waste time being wistful and slow
Get so tired of singing your songs

Say I'll move to the city
When I'm finally grown
But I been driving the long way home
Round the block just to finish that song

Deciduous forest ain't growing my way
Say things'll get better when I get away
But I been watching the skyline and been getting home late
Counting ways that I love you and lights on the parkway
Where was I hiding when
We all grew up
Watching blinking lights changing
On the edge of some bluff
I keep making mistakes
And they’re not makin me any tougher
And I wish everyone liked me but
You'd be more than enough

Swallowing stones
On the way past your home
I like who your parents r voting for
There's a sign on your lawn

I'm gunna move to the city
When they tell me that I've grown
We could waste our lives being wistful and slow
Miss my prime while I'm choking on stonesYou might also likeEmbed
