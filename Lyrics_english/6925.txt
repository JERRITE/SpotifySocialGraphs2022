OG Black Lyrics ["Og Black" letter]]

[Chorus]
I take you for a walk in a Banshee roba'o
Like OG Black, like OG Black, like OG Black
We make a porn in the part of Atrá '
Like OG Black, like OG Black, like OG Black

[Post-car]
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
[Verse 1: Álvaro Díaz]
I look at your eye 'and see lights
Damn is the man who uses you
You deserve a grangi, you are not pa 'losers
Let him take you for the fair and win to 'the stuffed animals'
Follow, Follow, Falo looks at what cache at the crossroads (pa'l crossing)
Flowers, that the poli did not listen to me
You have yours and that makes me amended
I charge you to 'the package' if you buy in the Super (EY)
You are ahead '(EY), Tesla Cyber ​​Truck (EY)
It has a torque (EY), Father with the bo
You have me circling, I feel tony hawk
Christian Dior dress, I thank God

[Chorus]
I take you for a walk in a Banshee roba'o
Like OG Black, like OG Black, like OG Black
We make a porn in the part of Atrá '
Like OG Black, like OG Black, like OG Black (what, what, what?)

[Post-car]
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo
That does not stop the beautiful. that does not stop the Bellaqueo

Vo'a giving you hard as Banshee roba'o
With the tongue leave the phillie well Enrola'o
Pa'l hell
He playing play and you at home with the panty pa'l la'o
Pégalo, OG Black
Those who want Bellaqueo, where are they?
Hamomo 'a porn in the part of Atrá' of the album
I bless you that ass and I'm not minister
Keep perriating alone, I have 'Juquea'o as a drug
Fall in love with the ass, amorfoda
I think it's the picket, I'm free and fucks
If you want 'chingamo' without wedding, wedding
