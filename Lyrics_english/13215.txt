Lady Bird Lyrics[Verse 1: Nancy Sinatra]
I've been where the eagle flies
Rode his wings 'cross autumn skies
Kissed the sun, touched the moon
But he left me much too soon
His lady bird, he left his lady bird

[Verse 2: Lee Hazlewood]
Lady bird, come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird, I'll treat you good
Ah, lady bird, I wish you would
You lady bird, pretty lady bird
[Verse 3: Nancy Sinatra]
Lightning flashed across the sky
The night he taught me how to fly
The sun came up and then I found
Too soon he let his lady down
His lady bird, I'm his lady bird

[Verse 4: Lee Hazlewood]
Lady bird, come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird, I'll treat you good
Ah, lady bird, I wish you would
You lady bird, pretty lady bird

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5: Nancy Sinatra]
Winter lives in my heart
In the times we're apart
Summer sings a song or two
When he says "I love you true"
My lady bird, yeah, I'm his lady bird

[Outro: Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra]
Lady bird, come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird, I'll treat you good
Ah, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird, pretty lady bird (I'm your lady bird)
You're a lady bird (Yes, I'm a lady bird)
You're too much, you little bird (Hahaha)You might also like1Embed
