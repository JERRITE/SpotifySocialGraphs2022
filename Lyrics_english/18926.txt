Alcohaulinâ€™ Ass LyricsCome on

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of booze
A little bit of me
And a little bit of you
A little bit country
A little bit of blues
A little slice of heaven
And a little piece of you... come on
Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaul...in' ass

A little bit thirsty
A little bit used
A little bit of whiskey
And a little pinch of chew
A little bit tired
And a bad attitude
A little bit of drinkin'
And another piece of you

Yeah, come on

Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Yeah, come on
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin'
Alcohaulin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on

You drove me to it
So there was nothing I could do
You pushed me down, split me right in two
Now I've hauled the long hard load
Carried the weight of you
Boy oh boy goddamn
There's only one thing left to do... a little bit of

Pour another drink in my glass

Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin'
There's only one thing left to do
Yeah, a little bit of
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaul...in' assEmbed
