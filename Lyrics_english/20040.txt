666 Problems Lyrics[Chorus]
Brought six niggas with me and they all want beef
Brought six bitches with me and they all wanna leave
Got six shots for a nigga thats eye ballin me
666 problems, the vices and demons are conquering me
Brought six niggas with me and they all want beef
Brought six bitches with me and they all wanna leave
Got six shots for a nigga thats eye ballin me
666 problems, the vices and demons are conquering me

[Verse]
Huh, slide on a nigga, where he hiding?
Hurry the animals wildin
The stampede is keepin me smilin
Bow down and nigga pay homage
Might end it and enjoy the silence
Not weak at all not in the slightest
And you can't do nothin about it (huh)
Sacrifice the sheep from the land of the free (huh)
Tell the ones i love that I’m sorry but don't lean on me (huh)
I won't Mac Miller and I won’t Lil Peep
But I might Cobain, catch me wit no brain
Satan with the horns, and pac wit the nose ring nigga (huh)
Thoughts in my mind get scary
New game new lames same fairies
And I never claim rapper, I be too embarrassed
Question, where is the shame?
Lying and faking for personal gain
Know that these bitches can't all be the same
Claim a religion but act like a gang
Shoot with the sniper don't question my range
Answer already I'm going insane
Voices and voices inside of my brain
Numb most times cause I'm awful with pain
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you gave it all away for a deal
Tell me what you do when they take back the mills
Tell me how you eat when you can't afford a meal (huh)
Diamond noose for the slaves so it match they diamond grills (huh)
Diamond noose for the slaves so it match they diamond grills (huh)
Human race I can't save, human race I must kill (huh)
Human race I can't save, human race I must kill

[Chorus]
Brought six niggas with me and they all want beef
Brought six bitches with me and they all wanna leave
Got six shots for a nigga thats eye ballin me
666 problems, the vices and demons are conquering meYou might also likeEmbed
