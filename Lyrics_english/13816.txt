Drive and Disconnect Lyrics[Verse 1]
Run, run, running
Drive me away, I
See 'em come, come, coming
Don't wanna stay, wanna stay in
Days like, days like this, like this
Find a better place than this, than this

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to escape from them, from them
I guess, I guess, I guess
[Chorus]
We drive and we disconnect
We drive and we disconnect
Send my best, no regrets
With the wind, I'm gone
I guess, I guess
We drive and we disconnect

[Verse 2]
Tell me to stay
But I couldn't, even if I wanted
Tell me to lie
But I committed too many crimes
Let's stay like, stay like this, like this
Why can't we remain like this, like this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to escape from them, from them
I guess, I guess, I guess

[Chorus]
We drive and we disconnect
We drive and we disconnect
Send my best, no regrets
With the wind, I'm gone
I guess, I guess
We drive and we disconnect

Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to me

[Chorus]
We drive and we disconnect
We drive and we disconnect
Send my best, no regrets
With the wind, I'm gone
I guess, I guess
We drive and we disconnect

[Outro]
Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to me
Heaven know
Look what you do to meEmbed
