Nicest Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
All I know is that you're so nice
You're the nicest thing I've seen
I wish that we could give it a go
See if we could be something

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was your favourite girl
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world

[Chorus 1]
I wish my smile was your favourite kind of smile
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style
I wish you couldn't figure me out
But you'd always wanna know what I was about
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset
I wish you'd never forget
[Verse 2]
The look on my face when we first met
I wish you had a favourite beauty spot
That you loved secretly
'Cause it was on a hidden bit
That nobody else could see
Basically, I wish that you loved me

[Chorus 2]
I wish that you needed me
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars
Actually, I meant three
I wish that without me your heart would break
Yeah, I wish that without me
You'd be spending the rest of your nights awake
I wish that without me you couldn't eat
Yeah, I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep

[Outro]
Look, all I know is that
You're the nicest thing I've ever seen
And I wish that we could see if we could be something
Yeah, I wish that we could see if we could be somethingYou might also like9Embed
