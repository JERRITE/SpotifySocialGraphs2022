Fly (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Super Cat]
What it is! All nice and easy slip of the curl
This is Super Cat and Sugar Ray riding through
Spread your love and fly, fly...

[Verse 1]
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
(Lord, have mercy)
[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
(Uh, where you, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
(Where you want, where you try, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby
(I, I, I w-w-would tell her, here, well
Spread your love and fly, oh, me, oh, my
Spread your love and fly, oh, me for I
Spread your love and fly, fly)

[Verse 2]
Dance a little stranger
Show me where you've been (Say what?)
Love can make you hostage
Wanna do it again (Word)
There's no time to think
'Bout the starting or the end (Never)
We'll find out, I'm told
My mother, she told me so
(Yeah, yeah, check it out)

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
(Higher, higher, higher, high, high, high)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
(Like a birdie in the sky up so high)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby

I just want to fly (Grow your wing and fly)
(Uh, w-where you want)
(Uh, w-where you want)

[Verse 3]
Love you, baby girl, love, and I'll tell no lie
All the women all be lovin'
They want to come a me I, just like I
And the they wanna fly
Me have a lovely girl
I'm gon' tell her bye-bye and
Grow your wing and fly, oh, me, oh, my
Spread your love and fly, fly
It's chickadee time on the borderline
Don't tell a lie, won't tell a lie, bye-bye
Bye-buh-buh-buh-bye, bye-buh-buh-buh-bye

[Verse 4]
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you? (Ain't my thing)
Everyone I know has been so good to me (Hey, hear that)
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
(Lord, have mercy)

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
(Like a birdie in the sky up so high)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby (All night long)
I just wanna fly
(Higher, higher, higher, higher, high, high, high)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
(Like a birdie in the sky up so high)
Put your arms around me, baby
(High, high, high, high, higher than high)
Put your arms around me, baby
(Don't be shy, 'cause we all forget to fly)
I just wanna fly
(Like a birdie in the sky up so high)

[Outro]
All around the world, statues crumble for me
(High, high, high, high, higher than a kite
Spread your wing and fly, oh, me, oh, my)
I just wanna fly
Spread your wings and fly, give it up for I
Spread your wing and fly, oh, me, oh, my
Spread your wing and fly, because
