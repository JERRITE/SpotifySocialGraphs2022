Lyrics paper love [Lyrics for "Paper Love" FT. Atony]

[Intro: Herabroke]
(Tell me if you don't love me)
(Mommy, don't comfort me)
(The closer, it hurts)
(Our love is in papers)
Get out of Huebear, atony

[Chorus: Herabroke]
Tell me if you don't love me
Mommy, don't comfort me
The closer, it hurts
Our love is in papers
The smiles were left behind
I know that if I'm not taken by your hand, it's going to go wrong
Tell me if I did something wrong
Your red eyes of smoking and crying
Mommy, don't expect me
My cora always hurts
The closer, it hurts
Our love is in papers
(Mommy, don't expect me)
(My cora always hurts)
(The closer, it hurts)
(Our love is in papers)
[Verse: Herabroke]
I'm throwing clones as if I wanted
Your gaze is sad and cold as if you understood
Ma ', I opened my cora and my doll with scissors
I've never been good so I don't know what you expect
Mommy, like luny, I'm your plastic doll
Lloremo 'listening "is not so much"
BÃ³rrame of your eyes and your mind
Love me that life is not to always

[Chorus: Herabroke]
Tell me if you don't love me
Mommy, don't comfort me
The closer, it hurts
Our love is in papers
The smiles were left behind
I know that if I'm not taken by your hand, it's going to go wrong
Tell me if I did something wrong
Your red eyes of smoking and crying
Mommy, don't expect me
My cora always hurts
The closer, it hurts
Our love is in papers
Cut yourself! (Mommy, don't expect me)
(My cora always hurts)
(The closer, it hurts)
(Our love is in papers)
