Love-Hate-Sex-Pain Lyrics[Verse 1]
In this life I'm me, just sitting here alone
By the way I tried to say I'd be there for you
Walk the silent emptiness that leads me by my hands
And throw away what I don't understand, as a man

[Chorus]
Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's underestimated lies
[Verse 2]
And I wonder as I tear away my skin
It's taken me so long to stitch these wounds from where I've been
And mother please don't bury me, I'm begging for my life
It's hard to say that I will be complete before I die

[Chorus]
Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's underestimated lies

[Bridge]
Don't you worry, please
Don't you leave me
Because I surely slip away
Though love, hate, sex, and pain
I fall away into
Love, hate, sex, and pain

[Chorus]
Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's underestimated lies
