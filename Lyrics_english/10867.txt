Sleep Is A Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sleep is a rose
But I only hear the gale wind blowing cold
Against my windows
As I fold then I curl my leg around yours in a hold
I said, "darling, I'm scared of growing old"
I'm sorry if I'm loud
I'm just worrying about that now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I lay here
I'm still waiting for the sun
[Chorus]
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

[Verse 2]
I started to listen to every little sound
And so how am I supposed to forget silence?
As I fold and I curl my own head around yours in a hold
You said, "my love, I'll take you to the fairground"
I know you're not around
You're sleeping and talking now

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm still laying here
Just waiting for the sun

[Chorus]
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

[Bridge]
And you said, "boy, you better know that you got this love"
And you said, "boy, you better know that you got this love"
You might also like[Chorus]
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
Yeah, you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

[Outro]
So I hope morning comes 'round soonEmbed
