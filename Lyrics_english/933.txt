It told me everything Lyrics [letter from "told me everything"]

[Intro: Jory Boy]
And I know what time was to have it alone
He just looked at me and told me everything
He told me everything
Oh, no, no

[Pre-car: Jory Boy]
I like it when he does what he does (with his mini short)
He says that nobody pleases it and whatever happens (whatever happens)
She always wages', Buena Nena Flow (AH-AH)
Papi gives everything, he has no problem ’(Mai, Yah)
I like it when he does what he does (oh; and I know what arrived)
[Chorus: Jory Boy]
And I know what time was to have it alone
Only Mе looked and told me everything
And if I let the time go by, another takes it
No no no)
And I know what time was to have it alone
He just looked at me and told me everything
And if I let time pass, another takes it
No no no)

[Verse 1: Ñengo Flow]
The moment is now
Be able to catch you alone (alone, Solita)
I would like to devour you all (uah, uah)
I know your eyes are talking to me
You are eating me with my eyes (hehehe)
I go for heaven, I will make me fly '
I suspend horror nights
Your voce ’between four stop 'are heard'
Your shout 'saying that I am the best

[Choir: Ñengo Flow & Jory Boy]
And he says that time to have her alone
If she looked at me and told me everything
And if I let time pass, another takes it
Nerd
And I know what time was to have it alone
He just looked at me and told me everything
And if I let time pass, another takes it
Nerd
And I know what time was to have it alone
He just looked at me and told me everything
And if I let time pass, another takes it
No, no (hahaha)

Like her none, she became harder
To 'the day' an adventure
Of smoking so much I feel in madness (haha)
And that moves it as you are not

My love, throw yourself without thinking and let me
That if this is not what you are looking for ', get into
I know you will never forget, prepare (mommy), yaah

You already know 'the perfect combi
In the ear you sing the beautiful 'and there is problem (mmm, baby)
