Since you arrived lyrics as you arrived 
 I don't burn the cold 
 My blood boil 
 I hear my beats 
 Since you arrived 
 Being happy is my vice 
 Contemplate the moon: 
 My best trade 

 I don't promise you eternal love because I can't 
 I am a crew of an adventurous cloud 
 A butterfly hunter when I see you 
 And summarized in three words: how much I love you 
 Arrababababasei Arrababababasei 
 How much I love you, hooooo 
 Arrababababasei Arrababababasei 
 Hoooooo 

 Since you arrived 
 Nothing is rotten 
 He marks the doubt 
 I hug a sigh 

 Since you arrived 
 There is no better reason 
 To wake me up 
 To feel alive 

 I don't promise you eternal love because I can't 
 I am a cloud crew, adventurer 
 A butterfly hunter when I see you 
 And summarized in three words: how much I love you

 How much I love you

 How much I love you
