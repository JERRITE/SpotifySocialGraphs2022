I'm going lyrics ["I go" ft letter. Daddy Yankee]

[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
UH-JAH
UH-JAH (Daddy)
UH-JAH (Zion & Lennox)
UH-JAH (You Know How We Do, Man)
UH-JAH (Let's do This)
UH-JAH (Come ON)
UH-JAH (Daddy, Daddy)
[Chorus: Zion, Daddy Yankee]
She does everything to seduce me
And I'm going, I'm going
Doing what she asks for
And I'm going, I'm going
Because it was the one I always wanted
And I'm going, I'm going
If I'm with her, it's not a crime
And I'm going, I'm going
She does everything to seduce me (Daddy)
And I'm going, I'm going
Doing what she asks for (Daddy)
And I'm going, I'm going
Because it was the one I always wanted (Come on)
And I'm going, I'm going
If I'm with her, it's not a crime (Daddy)
And I'm going, I'm going

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
(What what what?)
That nobody watches it
Or I'll make everything fly
That already has an owner, don't make me reveal me
She hurts, she smells very rich
Give me that seed for coffee to sneak
That nobody watches it
Or I'll make everything fly
That already has an owner, don't make me reveal me
She hurts, she smells very rich
Give me that seed for coffee to sneak
Come on, that's the thing, vamo'a there, vamo'a there
If this motivates you, I'm going there, I'm going there
It is not a crime, to give it to the ground
Is that tonight is
Until leather breaks
Motivating to'a yal, to'a la yal
I feel that the album will explode, it will explode
SANDUNGUING ALL PA'L SOIL
Is that tonight is
Until leather breaks

[Verse 2: Lennox]
Who like her when I enter heat?
She heals me when I'm sick of love
Mile 'I have proba'o, but unique e' your flavor
I love your color, bathed in sweat
Who like her when I enter heat?
She heals me when I'm sick of love
Mile 'I have proba'o, but unique e' your flavor
I love your color, bathed in sweat
You figure break all the schemes
Inside my whole system
Giving you down you are Candela
I want to shake in the sand, oh, baby
[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
Motivating to'a yal, to'a la yal
I feel that the album will explode, it will explode
SANDUNGUING ALL PA'L SOIL
Is that tonight is
Until leather breaks

[Chorus: Zion]
She does everything to seduce me
And I'm going, I'm going
Doing what she asks for
And I'm going, I'm going
Because it was the one I always wanted
And I'm going, I'm going
If I'm with her, it's not a crime
And I'm going, I'm going
She does everything to seduce me
And I'm going, I'm going
Doing what she asks for
And I'm going, I'm going
Because it was the one I always wanted
And I'm going, I'm going
If I'm with her, it's not a crime
And I'm going, I'm going
