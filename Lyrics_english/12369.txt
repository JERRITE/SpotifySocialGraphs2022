Chabos know who the Babo is (remix) lyrics [song text to "Chabos know who the babo is (remix)"]

[Hook: arrest warrant]
Chabos know who the Babo is
Hafti Abi is the one who sits in Lambo and Ferrari
Saudi Arabi Money Rich
Know who the Babo is
Attention, just don't make any harakets
Before I come and you break your nose
Know who the Babo is
Still the same chabo, bitch
Which you meet at the train station how he is just nosing
Know who the Babo is
W-W-Knowledge who the Babo is
[Bridge: Sample]
Reče Čiča da me Ženi
Danas Hoće Sutra Neće

[Part 1: Milonair]
Milonair, I give the ghetto 'a voice
In this sense, the stars are not even my limit
A brother from the bottom turns his rounds in the Benz
Micked flex to customers, bankers and hookers
Ah, men in cowls split the skull
The street wrote a lot of shit in my resume
Look, you are coming now, everyone wants to protect Milos
Everyone pushes thick eggs here, it is opened everywhere
Stay loose, lan, let the Babas go
I slaughter the victims like Muslims on Bayram
Perser, Kurds, Sweden or Turks
Humper sons get battles from me with a belt

[Part 2: Mosh36]
Through West Berlin in the sixth, lak, time means coal
Champions League gangsters who earn money like Michael Corleone
Ey, if the nightingale flies here, it becomes dangerous where I live
Ta7arias in my neighborhood search everyone here for drugs
Loose notes in your jeans are just withdrawn
36 Ryders stays my team, I get the crown on the side
I am now one in Berlin and have no idols at all at all
Give me that Mic, I am MC Mosh, for me it only goes up
Moët-Rosé rap, Lak, I pull rabbits out of cylinders
Speak the language of the street because I make a profit here with goods here
Yes, the location is disabled because most of them are tackled here
Eight out of ten on Hash and Haze, I space in the game like arrest warrant
You Might So Like [Part 3: Olexesh]
To see who the Babo is
I want to see that you go into the bank with the Uzi and take everything
Whether there is a security guard, I have no idea, me
Just want to see Taler, because five hundred is not enough
She knows who her peso is, because if the para is right
Can you be sure that there is nothing better than the bills
Yes you talk, the next one is ffm
Chabos know where the customers fix, without jokes, everything is torn torn
Block platinum, so what's going on, you Martin?
Spreng your cartel with the Bratans and Abis
Brate, grab the navigation, frying, bring them to the base
Because if it is clear, it is certain that the goods are paid

[Part 4: Habesha]
I'm partisan, shit on your party craze and Amiland
I was never there, Habesha, Northeast Africa
We make it clear, if not, if not, then it's called the assassination
Raid, hands high, coal, Landesbank
From the beginning, tooth for tooth, ghetto-catch, street clan
Middle finger high for every Zinker 31er
Forty, Düsseldorf boy, I am radical
Real Babos in the Hood do not need bodyguards
Balls in your ass, rapper make a tough one
You are gangsters in your Parts, never on the street
But forget these children, who are you interested in?
I cry ': Freedom Palestine! Netanyahu, dog son
[Part 5: Abdi]
Everyone wants to be the Babo, Pablo style
Akho, no, you are not Rambo 3
Ess your Magnum-White, which shows maroc
How to write albums, so silence!
Of the bizz was banged, eowa, come on
I bring it at a point like laser pointer
A double-z, rap flash effect like LSD
Abderrahim, Hep O Dakarai?
Andale, Andale, Juana Maria
Flous flows through music, the Berber makes Lila
Color banknotes with songs
Departure, Azzlack, we make coal on the assembly line

[Part 6: Celo]
Now Tacheles, you know who the Babos are:
M3, Angel Eyes, shortened license plate!
Bosna, Maghreb, Polska, Neuf-Trois, Otuz-Dört
And you hear this verses in every banlieue
Böööhss !! The Bosnian at the Kottbusser Tor, Stai Most,
Mantije, Cevape and Baba Stani OT
Rap in the Nike Black Destroyer! Hasch I care
After Ali Nazik, Öz Urfa Taş Kapı
Backyard Slang FFM, Selam an Azad, Hany
Solo, Adem, Aslan, Sadiq, Dú Maroc, Chaker, Yassir
Sezai Achi, Vega, Magic, Jones, Jeyz, Moses
Real Jay, D-Flame, Criz, Blaze, Tone, IZ
Bosca, Raf, Twin, Lunarfrow, northern massif
Turkish Power Boys, Adlerfront, Frankfurt remains stable!
Allz-y! Yallah, Zid! This sound is Narcotic
A double-z, Lak, call when you see the skyline!
[Hook: arrest warrant]
Chabos know who the Babo is
Hafti Abi is the one who sits in Lambo and Ferrari
Saudi Arabi Money Rich
Know who the Babo is
Attention, just don't make any harakets
Before I come and you break your nose
Know who the Babo is
Still the same chabo, bitch
Which you meet at the train station how he is just nosing
Know who the Babo is
W-W-Knowledge who the Babo is

[Part 7: Crackaveli]
B-E-R, L-i-N, F-F-M, Crack, Azzlack Connect
How imprisonment, I'll take everything away (let's go)
Because Crackaveli is not scared in no time
[?] Stiff neck, as if you are getting train
Berlin Azzlacks, none, do not push the hallus
We bring the bangers like all chabos and all Babos
We Berliner say about Chabo's brother, to Babo Boss
There is no access to Crackaveli besides God
You keep asking me: Kurmanci Zane? In Ta Arabi?
La, Ana Yugoslavi Yani
Hello Bree, go, let's do it because in
Germany everything goes gold, what Kanacken touch

[Part 8: Doe]
Chabos know who the Babo is, Akho, I want banknotes
Make plus until Babo stands in my cursed passport
JAG 'customers in the Lacoste suit in there
Make Money, I'm Doper as the cycling biz
Armstrong Lance, competition is tapped
Klatsch, Boom, Bang, Street-Fighter-Hadouken
Spackos are quiet when I speak a power word '
While you suck cock for a handful of haze
Either hang around with bar stubble in jail
Or in Saint Tropez on the beach rum fuck
What's going on, Bitch? Doe, HB
Chabos know who the Babo is

[Part 9: 60/60]
Chabos know who the Babo is, I'm the one who fucks Rambo
This Greco, who ticks in the Ghetto Haze or Hazro
Who fucks Chuck Norris, the hooker gets a knife stab
Serious look and boxer cut does not mean that you are a gangster
You dog don't know me, 60/60 is breaking you
Nobody gives you your hand anymore because you stink like a bum
When I'm on the transmitter, I'll take the packs away from you
Do not make an action because
Chabos know who the Babo is, Hello, Miss Mademoiselle
Look at how my jacket sits, tailor -made, Ralph Lauren
I want to see cash, bags full of narcotic
I pull lines on marble tiles and let my cock suck me

[Part 10: Al-Gear]
Chabos know who the Babo is, get started, get a signature
But actually I'm much more interested in who your mother is
Always in the sauna, of course without a towel
Kahbas see my SIP and say: "Look, shampoo!"
Fresh from the detention center, labert like a waterfall
In court, after that I fuck the daughter of the prosecutor
Fuck work, I prefer to lie lazy on the sofa
And write no application, al-Qaida also makes it so clear
Look at me, made alone into the charts
Because last year this star was in custody
When I came out, I ticked coke to the stars with detention
In the meantime, I myself belong to the stars with imprisonment

[Part 11: Veysel]
Uzis pull, headshots, blood flows like ketchup
Altendorf youth is Bella and really blatant
Pull his flex off the Colombian
The six with all the extras
You work for Almanya, you sit on dildos
Bingöl on Iki, Zaza without education
Just want to get out of the third world and start
Either rap or ATM
Want to drive Benz cars, 4-3 terrorkids
At night on the streets, Koka and Hero-Biz
Sit for years now because judges punish
Faces full of scars, revealed by wankers
But nobody gave me my hand like my brother Aykut
But I swear to him that German rap is now swallowing lead
Veysel, Azzlack that is fresh from the MAPUS
CH-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chabos know who the Babo is
[Hook: arrest warrant]
Chabos know who the Babo is
Hafti Abi is the one who sits in Lambo and Ferrari
Saudi Arabi Money Rich
Know who the Babo is
Attention, just don't make any harakets
Before I come and you break your nose
Know who the Babo is
Still the same chabo, bitch
Which you meet at the train station how he is just nosing
Know who the Babo is
W-W-Knowledge, who the Babo is 10Med
