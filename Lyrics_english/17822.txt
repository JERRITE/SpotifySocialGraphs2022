Don’t Start Lyrics[Intro]
Get money
Bizzy
GMTO
Tell my niggas get money, they go and get it
Look
Tell my niggas get money, they go and get it
Got some demons and gottas that always with it
Why these niggas be talkin’ like they won’t get it?
Feelin’ invincible
Until I send them monsters to make you invisible
Dash i’m sending these niggas to finish you
Mortal Combat how I pull up and finish you
Come to the block is what I call a business move
She like when I hit the moves
Get a TD then I do the cha-cha like Victor Cruz
And these bitches they pick and choose
Got a whole bunch of W’s, member I used to lose
I was trappin’ all in the school
Now I get it and flip it
I stack it like i’m a jew
And these niggas know what I do, so
[Verse 1]
Tell them niggas; don’t play with me
And I been gettin’ money, ain’t shit you could say to me
And this treesh wanna lay with me
And she tryna sleep over but no she can’t stay with me
Oh wait so you think it’s cool?
Yea I fuck with some GD’s but do not get it confused
And nigga don’t act a fool
Niggas droppin’ my shit fuck around imma get em boomed
Cause they know the factory
I be jackin’ my G’s, but the ones that be jackin’ me
And I know why they mad at me
Nigga catch me outside, don’t be facebook @in’ me
And he charged like a battery
Nigga think he hold weight until I burn them calories
He get charged like a battery
Nigga think he hold weight until I burn them calories
Couple shooters be with me
Call up Black we go 50 for 50
Niggas spinnin’ all until we get dizzy
Niggas politickin’ talkin’ bout Bizzy
Bitches callin’ me and sayin they miss me
I don’t got no time for no hickies, I just want the quickie
So slide off them vickies
Can’t fuck with a bitch if she friendly

Don’t start with me, and pussy nigga I won’t start with you
If its ba-da-bing then its ba-da-boom
Got a couple shooters that’ll dot em too like look
Don’t start with me, and pussy nigga I won’t start with you
If its ba-da-bing then its ba-da-boom
Got a couple shooters that’ll dot em too like look

[Verse 2]
Get money, that’s motivation
Demon he with me, he ready for altercations
And I got the situation
We shootin’ off rip don’t got time for no hesitations
And I ain’t in conversations
You ain’t in my circle, you outta place
Told that bitch I need brain I can’t concentrate
Got some shooters from Jersey thats outta state like
Look
Call Choppa you whore
Cause that nigga movin’
I ain’t no metro but my niggas boomin’
Rooga in that cut, you know he be boolin’ like
Look
Ion Choo, ion Woo neither
Niggas know my salute I ain’t grabbin’ my shoe either
Nigga I spit ether
If a nigga run up we gon’ send him a few heaters
Nigga I spit ether
If a nigga run up we gon’ send him a few heaters3Embed
