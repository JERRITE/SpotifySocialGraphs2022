Letâ€™s Be Animals LyricsPhantom faces hide in dark places
We feel safe away from anyone at all
The secret obsession, we hold in possession
The very thing that keeps you traveling inside my dreams

So let's take off the clothes, run through the streets
Scream at the moon and scuff up our feet
Won't hear a word, sing, brother, sing, we're terrible
Let's be animals, oh

Our mothers and fathers were lovers before us
We were just creatures who were born to carry on
And maybe we're evil, we're mostly just people
Afraid of the living 'cause we might just think it's fun
So let's take off the clothes, run through the streets
Scream at the moon and scuff up our feet
Won't hear a word, sing, brother, sing, we're terrible

So let's kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like and do what we please
Won't hear a word, sing, brother, sing, we're terrible
Let's be animals, oh, let's be animals, oh

Kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like and do what we please
Kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like and do what we please

Kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like and do what we please
Kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like

Let's be animals, oh, let's be animals, oh

Kiss in the dark, sleep in the trees
Go where we like and do what we please
Let's be animals, oh, let's be animalsYou might also likeEmbed
