Lyrics walk around [letter from "walk there" ft. Wisin, Cosculluela, Ozuna, Farruko, Nicky Jam, Ñengo Flow, Archangel, Zion, Alexio & Bad Bunny]

[Intro: ozuna]
The pentagon (oh, oh, oh, oh)
They live pending '(haha)
They try to do what he does' (Ozuna)
Women also have them '(the pentagon)
I try to download and I can't
My music controlling the street (haha)
Nobody lowers me from the ship that I don't lower me (Revol)
Diamond 'shine, you pending me
They are fifty thousand on the wrist, Endiamanta'o the AP
[Chorus: Zion]
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Stop me, tempt with its end
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Let them be thrown out that they will cease to exist
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Stop me, tempt with its end
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Let them be thrown out that they will cease to exist

[Verse 1: cosculluela]
Pending to the street, I'm colder than a Eskimo
Follow my steps, you know 'Where are you going to finish
I already have bullets, ready, to see who slips
To bury their career in their own room
Revoltillo, here I emptied only one brush
Because nobody wants to face the god of rings
At the top, there is no rapper who touches me
I caused the wave of rhymes to roll them
This is line per line, bar by bar
The toughest rapping, nobody on the subject grabs me
What I want to tell you, I will admit you
I hate them, I bastard, I can't even smile at them

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
(YEH-YEH-YEH-YEH)
Easy takes it, or if not, I reveal me (rrruh)
I do not break, the ice meant (blap!)
The hell is frozen (season!)
My grandson 'are already a millionaire' thanks to their grandfather
With the stick 'and they are not pa'l sushi
Bastard, in my combo to the Forty are Gucci (Yi ', Yi')
Mercedes, there is no more Suzuki
Hard as a legend, but being a roakie
I am the one, I carry it, the most charged 'in the new'
A topic I record, another topic that I hit
Without getting retros, like Jordan took off
I killed them, but it wasn't bad faith like Tego, Yah
You Might Also Like [verse 3: Alexio]
They walk there pending me, I of their wife '
We are fine with pocket and super good powers
Smoke curtains that the juice arrived
That the skinny 'stopped consumption
No one knows what I do, I stuck and I'm vague
And chicho so much that I look like a prepaid
I have twenty enemy ', yes, disguise'o of friend'
Because nobody wants to collide with me
And scares leave, they have the short ones' in rebell
Moldy because they have never hala'o el deo '
Revol, if Jaimito, Blanca and double come out
Those who point out, ey

[Verse 4: Ñengo Flow]
This is the Pentagon, I break you and Vámono '
Because the polizontes are already looking for '
I am a storm that starts the ceiling to 'the one who invents
Do not take care of me, take care of my tool '
The bug have to breastfeed, they won't sign up
I have always lived at war, I was born to kill
They never kill with the hand at the time 'to shoot
Of the trigger in the trigger, the song 'are going to fly
The chips of a thirty comb, it is not sweet e 'mint
I'm still standing for the prayer of my old woman
I listen to voices in the distance they call me and shout me
As much as I try to take away, the bad does not take away
[Chorus: Zion]
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Stop me, tempt with its end
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Let them be thrown out that they will cease to exist
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Stop me, tempt with its end
They walk out there 'of me (-a from me)
Let them be thrown out that they will cease to exist

[Verse 5: Nicky Jam]
They walk like crazy 'around
They want to stop me, but I'm still on (Lighting)
And try to keep mine
But I don't have time for those messes
That is why I work and at the same time multiplying
I know that many were underestimating me
But calmly for the la'o I was happening
The numbers up and the account increasing
Take me whatever, that's what I'm killing
Discus me if it sounds like I'm snoring
But I'm in a lamb 'and my doña in a Phantom
But I'm in a lamb 'and my doña in a Phantom

[Verse 6: wisin]
(Ladies and gentlemen, the Pentagon)
They are like rajieros (Yeah), bordering me without money
The more that puts you, you know what I mean
I always exaggerate when I accelerate
Do not compare with me, I am the more than genre
The tigueraje, in the camouflage pentagon
Care in lights and tolls
The cowboy is loose and walks in sabotage plan
I am the most I put him, with a wild style (hard)
Puppies, when I go out I erase them
Fronteing with me, Chinchorro stars
Making money the world I go
You have no savings, Cotorro, you are fighting with the fox (hard!)

[Verse 7: Archangel]
(Daddy)
The saga began, I come to shine like Lady Gaga (Yes)
And I don't want to dirty the sole with his face to my Balenciaga
The times changed, take it to the step
To 'the one who puts the hand, picamo' the arm (yeah)
Take advice 'and have a case
That we are on fire, whatever you say ', for lining I spend
Quiet, soft, my sister, who from AK-47 are the pepitazo '
Quiet, my corduroy, that in any morning
I put you 'to scream like above' of the grass
La Marash, controlling more corners than an octagon (that is like that)
The main minister in the Pentagon

[Verse 8: Farruko]
(Request reinforcement '; Farru!)
Remove cadet ', return to your brigade
Revol, prepare the troops that I'm going to make my entry (Yes, Sir)
Salúden me with respect and give me the looks
That its general in command 'and the Armed Forces (Farru!)
The Pentagon, the highest authority
Gender belongs to me outside my property
Or I'm going to sink the bunker, bastards, this is not Battleship
I have a carbon sport and my to'as glopets have chip
Call of Duty: Black Ops, with two backup combs
Of 30 for the glock, cargo to the Tomahawk
Lo Pablo Emilio Escobar
The donkey 'come and go, they tell me the chapo Guzmán

[Chorus: Zion, Farruko]
They walk out there 'of me
Stop me, tempt with its end
They walk out there 'of me
Let them be thrown out that they will cease to exist
