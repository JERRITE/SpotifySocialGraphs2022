Fulanito

[Pre-car: Becky G]
What a way
How he gets what he wants
I left 'from the first (like this, so e')
Do what anyone does
And don't 'go so well (good)
[Chorus: Becky G]
He and the Fulanito (the Fulanito)

Dancing Squeech '(OH)
Today I wow 'to sleep
He and the Fulanito
That has me crazy
Dancing squeech '
Until 'boten from here

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Move it, which squeezes you, net (shiuf!)
No 'spectam' the kid 'that I have on the card (prr!)
Move it, which squeezes, net (shiuf!)
I get pretty, I get flirtatious (ah)
Only for you because I want to eat you and that everything 'do not see (pa' that everything 'do not see)
Only for you because with you I have what another 'wants (so e', daddy; wuh!)
When I move like this you can tell you that you like it
And puts you 'Happy when he bites' of this fruit
When I move like this (like this) you can see that you like it (aha)
And puts you 'happy (so happy) when it bites' of this fruit

[Chorus: Becky G & El Alfa]
He and the Fulanito (the Fulanito)
That has me crazy (Wuh!)
Dancing squeech '
Today I wow 'to sleep
He and 'the Fulanito (OH)
That has me crazy
Dancing squeech '(Yao)
