Silk Chiffon Lyrics[Verse 1: MUNA]
Sun down and I'm feeling lifted
Downtown, cherry lipstick
Watch her silk dress dancing in the wind
Watch it brush against her skin
Makes me wanna try her on

[Pre-Chorus: MUNA]
Like, life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm out 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon
[Chorus: MUNA]
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
(Oh, when she's on)

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm high and I'm feeling anxious
Inside of the CVS
When she turns 'round halfway down the aisle
With that 'you're on camera' smile
Like she wants to try me on

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & MUNA]
And life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm out 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

[Chorus: MUNA & Phoebe Bridgers]
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

Oo, why wouldn't it be? Oo, why wouldn't it be?
If it feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oo, why wouldn't it be? Oo, why wouldn't it be?
She's so soft like silk chiffon

[Chorus: MUNA & Phoebe Bridgers]
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

[Outro: MUNA]
Oh, when she's on me11Embed
