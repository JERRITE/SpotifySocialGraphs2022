When Someone Loves You LyricsWhen someone loves you, it don't feel like this
They don't leave scars on your soul or cuts on your wrist
When someone loves you, they don't run when you cry
They don't make you feel ugly or empty inside

They don't try to blame you when they're wrong
Or kick you to the curb to show they're strong
They don't tear you down, they don't raise their fist
When someone loves you, it don't feel like this

When someone loves you, they're patient and kind
They are strong when you're weary, they don't leave you behind
They laugh when you laugh, and they cry when you cry
And even if they can't help you, at least they will try
And they will say they're sorry when they're wrong
And always make you feel like you belong
I know they're out there, yes they exist
When someone loves you, it should feel like this
When someone loves you, it should feel like thisYou might also likeEmbed
