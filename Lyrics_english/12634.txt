Lonely Vampire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Does anybody else here feel like a freak?
A million side-eyes following me
Weaving in and out, don't want your company
Too many people here, I don't wanna meet

[Chorus]
Lah-lah-lonely vampire, and I can't change
Talking to you is like a ray of sunshine
Dancing in the fire, hope it rains
I'm a vampire, so out of place, but I'm trying to be cool for one night
Lonely vampire
Lah-lah-lonely vampire
[Verse 2]
Really want to scream shit
But can't find my mouth
(But can't find my mouth)
My head is talking so loud
I can't turn it down
It's like
Hate, love, hate, love, hate, love, hate, love, hate, love, hate, love

[Chorus]
Lah-lah-lonely vampire, and I can't change
Talking to you is like a ray of sunshine
Dancing in the fire, hope it rains
I'm a vampire, so out of place, but I'm trying to be cool for one night
Lonely vampire
Lah-lah-lonely vampire

[Bridge]
(Trying to be cool)
(Trying to be cool)

[Chorus]
Lah-lah-lonely vampire, and I can't change
Talking to you is like a ray of sunshine
Dancing in the fire, hope it rains
I'm a vampire, so out of place, but I'm trying to be cool for one night
Lonely vampire
Lah-lah-lonely vampire
