Olive & An Arrow LyricsWe've never been into honesty
So promise me you'll let me know
When you're lying
She wants to be an eagle
And when she's high she can fly
No matter what she was trying

She'll be the perfect woman
Then she'll change suddenly
You wanna cry from the feeling
She's got a heart of gold but
Every now and again she'll turn to gray
And you know she gives me
An olive then an arrow in the back
She leaves me breathless
Then she kicks me while I'm down

And she leaves me hoping
My love won't show
'Cause I know she'll give me
An olive and an arrow, yeah, yeah

She doesn't like to worry
But she's afraid of everything
That's going on around her
I'm just another photo
That made it's way on her page
Somehow I stayed but it won't be long

An olive, yeah, yeah, then an arrow in the back
She leaves me breathless
Then she'll kick me while I'm down

She leaves me hoping
That my love won't show
'Cause I know she'll give me
An olive and an arrow, yeah

You leave me hoping and praying
That my love won't show
'Cause I know you'll give me
An olive and an arrow, oh yeah, yeahYou might also like1Embed
