N.V.M.L. Lyrics [Text of "N.V.M.L." ft. Dani Faiv]

[Intro: Dani Faiv & Nitro]
It is better if you keep those hands down
I don't want problems not touch me anymore
We all look like rods when you pay you nah
I told you he didn't protect me God
I was elected as neo
So now don't touch what is mine

[Refrain: Dani Faiv]
We want to do them yes
And we have to do them immediately
Then it reaches the point immediately
I don't want to die shiny
We want to do them yes
And after sifting them immediately
But the money does not make me subject
I don't want to die shiny
[Verse 1: Dani Faiv]
Dani is like Bunny, yes, I have carrots
Friar 'You are not funny, you are just an idiot
I can't forgive me, I have the past gray
She is about to give me, I hope not a child
Full rod, muffin, laugh like Murphy
Eyes with x rays, speak how you eat
I fought a lot, it looks like the Matrix movie
Now fucking a lot, it looks like a Matri movie
Don't touch what is mine
That I am happy as when Belen's porn came out
Seven days like God
I want to eat leftovers on the tip of the Eiffel Tower
Show, come on, bears a mirror
I look at the door mirror
If you were looking for mercy
It can't happen, no, like the dead Merry
I put a tot to take it, now it's cocking that you take
We are lock & stock, we are overseas
Pugni Brock Lesnar, for the collection
I ran like Bolt, eh
Which Threesome, who are trimone
Bring the rudder, I take as a timon
Bro pushed, among you you know the name, come on dill

[Refrain: Dani Faiv]
We want to do them yes
And we have to do them immediately
Then it reaches the point immediately
I don't want to die shiny
We want to do them yes
And after sifting them immediately
But the money does not make me subject
I don't want to die shiny

Stupid, do not touch what is mine
Because you know where I come from, the promises keep them (uh)
I see the character of the moment, he has more courage than talent
I'm not on stage, I belong to you
I have a deep sense of duty
This is because I love my job, I know how to do it
I work sixty days a month, I never pay to drink
How to stay on vacation all year round
I open a new account in Montecarlo
And please until the day they will not notice
Those who command the country, who fuck women
With the balls because they don't have any
Hey Bwoy, you have to do from scratch
You made another pack pack for kind concession of 'I'm the fuck
If you really want to verify, they make me holy this year
And then you have to rap a gospel to stay at my passage
As long as you want I'm the checkpoint and it's Inter nos
I really fuck me a fuck what you say
The boss wins so much, then insert coin
Wanna Bring That Noise?
I fought a lot to have all this and I don't separate
Reborn, I'm ready for the shot
Sorry so much if I was not clear
Don't touch what is mine
[Bridge: Nitro & Dani Faiv]
Do you know how much I fought for all this?
I didn't give up, but I stripped in the middle of the dark pytho
And I learned soon that you are already fucking
And they didn't tell you, so with permission
It is better if you keep those hands down
Keep those hands down!

[Refrain: Dani Faiv]
We want to do them yes
And we have to do them immediately
Then it reaches the point immediately
I don't want to die shiny
We want to do them yes
And after sifting them immediately
But the money does not make me subject
I don't want to die lucidembed
