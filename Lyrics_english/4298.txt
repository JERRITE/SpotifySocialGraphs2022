TranslationEnglishvuelve to my lyrics [letter from "back to me"]

[Verse 1]
I don't understand what you want from me
I'm crying in this song
I can't breathe without you anymore
You stole the sun, Yeah
Why do you hurt me so much, love?
If I have given you everything without thinking
Until losing reason, Yeah
[Pre-car]
You got the best of me
I am cold our room
No photos that tell me about you
But here I still see you
You don't want to go from my body
You are in every corner

[Chorus]
Please come back to me
I dont want to go on like this
I am just the shadow of what I was
Please, wherever you are, just return to me

[Post-car]
Back to me
Back to me
Back to me

[Verse 2]
How to do to forget, love?
If with you I learned to love
And I can't believe how I still live, resisting
Like a ship aimless
I have lost my time, I have lost my world

You got the best of me
I am cold our room
No photos that tell me about you
But here I still see you
You don't want to leave, you're in every corner

[Chorus]
Please come back to me
I dont want to go on like this
I am just the shadow of what I was
Please, wherever you are, just come back, come back to me

[Post-car]
Go back to me (uoh)
Back to me
Please, wherever you are, just return to me

[Outro + guitar only]
Return, come back, oh
