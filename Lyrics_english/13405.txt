At Least I Lived It With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Staring out in the dark
Is it a star or a jet?
Will we live forever?
Or will the world forget about us, too?
At least I lived it with you
And, oh, is lovely to love you and you love me, too

We dig our feet in the sand
Will our dreams outrun us?
Or could we catch up to them if we held hands?
I wanna chase them with you
'Cause, oh, does it feel like we could do anything us twoYou might also likeEmbed
