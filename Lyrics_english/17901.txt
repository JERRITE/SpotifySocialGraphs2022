Under Lyricsletra water "under water"

I want to fly with you, very high somewhere
I would like to be with you seeing the stars on the sea
I want to find another way to put on my dress and go for a walk with you
I want to tell the world that we are not friends, tell the sadness
That does not cross my way

I want to fly with you, very high somewhere
I would like to be with you seeing the stars on the sea
I want to find another way to put on my dress and go for a walk with you
I want to tell the world that we are not friends, tell the sadness
That does not cross my way
Today because I go
Against the force of a submarine
To conquer that lady who plays with me so much
I go for the world alone and without friends
I'm doing so many laps without any sense
But you yesterday changed my destiny
You gave me life, much more life than wine
You gave me strength in the cold days
You wanted to miss you without any reason

I want to find another way to put on my dress and go for a walk with you
I want to tell the world that we are not friends, tell the sadness
That does not cross your way
That does not cross, no
That does not cross, no
That does not cross, Noyou mihht Also Like1embed
