Alone (remix) Lyrics [letter from “alone (remix)” ft. Brytiago & Alex Rose]

[Intro: Anuel AA, Alex Rose, Lunay & Lyanno]
Real until death, baby (Yeh-Yeah, Yeh-Yeah, EH)
Mera, tell me Lunay
This is the remix
Baby, you know (baby)
Lu-Lu-Lunay

[Pre-car: Brytiago]
You are a ghost that disappeared
You know how to use the body in your favor
Between smoke and an oxycodone
You left me crazy, wanting to undress you
And if I take you again, you will not leave
Pending whatsapp to see if you read me
Tell me what punched it was what you did to me
[Chorus: Lunay, Lyanno & Anuel AA]
Tell me how I do now
To be able to have you alone
You making the difficult
And I wanting to eat you all
Tell me how I do it now (baby)
To be able to have you alone
You making the difficult (-Fíci-il)
And I wanting to eat you all (huh, eh)

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
You have me wrapped (uah)
And I always think (OH-OH-OH-OH-OH)
And you always treat me like a stranger (EH-EH, EH-EH)
And I know your body (baby)
And I remember you naked, you on me
And kills me that you always treat me 'like this
You make the difficult (EH-EH)
So good but so lassie (eh-eh), uah-uah
And sooner or later I get to Guaya-Ar
No matter how much that Picheés did not vary (eh-eh)
And I always think about you (baby)
Squeezing you all, biting you (uah)
A secret 'e Victoria, your interio-o-or clothes (o-o-or)
And I inside you, a heated-ó-ó -ón (o-ó-eón)
In the dark doing the master-or (o-or)
Always take it 'to vapo-o-o-or, baby

And I am not begging
You have me looking for you since you left
I swore I was not going to call you
But I don't forget how rich you did, huh
Baby, as you do to me ', none
You want 'Musarte as the grass that smokes you'
Baby, I caused a lagoon
Montal with Lu-Lu-Lunay Pa 'La Luna

[Chorus: Lyanno & Anuel AA]
Tell me how I do now
To be able to have you alone
You making the difficult
And I wanting to eat you all (all)
Tell me how I do it now (baby)
To be able to have you alone (alone)
You making the difficult (-Fíci-il)
And I wanting to eat you to'a (to'a)

[Verse 3: Brytiago]
Baby, give me a break pa 'lower stress
Vamo 'a' esbaratar the bed as the last time
I want it to be repeated, I want to eat you enterita
And when I put it complete, I want to hear how you shout ', Yeh
You have me a slave to my cell phone
Waiting for how ñejo you give me a call
If you do not want, then, then I do not vo 'to force
When you are to me, I look for you and I turn
What if I have the condoms? Of course
Pending DM to see if I connect to you
Baby, why don't you loosen that?
[Verse 4: Lyanno]
Ly-Ly-Ly, has a thousand envy-sa '
He arrives and puts them nervous'
She doesn't even know what is beautiful (ah-ah)
But dangerous, you don't confuse your thorns with rose '
She lives life upside down and has never visited'o kress
Does not need that challenge, she is a twenty of ten
Yes it comes back ', I fall again
For not forget how in the first time (Yeah)

[Verse 5: Alex Rose]
I always threw screen to your photos
And when you upload something, I check the pin
Treating 'and locate and Google does not give me the link
I throw you private but always leave me in Seen
It seems that he took him seriously
That was not serious
And now what was a game became a mystery
Baby, take me from Friendzone
That I am still alive here in full cemetery
Waiting for you
Let's see if we are again
And we kill the desire we have
I know that maybe you have a new jevo
But here I go again

[Chorus: Brytiago & Lunay]
And tell me how I do now
To be able to have you alone
You making the difficult
And I wanting to eat you all
Tell me how I do it now (baby)
To be able to have you alone
You making the difficult (fíci-il)
And I wanting to eat you all (baby)
