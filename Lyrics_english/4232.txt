He loves me Lyrics [Lyrics for "He loves me" ft. Ozuna, Brytiago, Archangel & Cosculluela]

[Intro: Brytiago & Ozuna]
We lose twenty hours fighting for the day
But four are always left over
Pa 'give it to four
And although the relationship is shit (woh-oh)
With sex it is fixed (ozuna)

[Choir: Ozuna & Brytiago]
That is why when it arrives it stays, ah-ah (ah-ah-ah)
I ask for a song of that and give it to me, ah-ah (ah-ah-ah)
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
Much blah, blah, blah
And he stays ah, ah (oh)
I ask for a song of that and gives it to me, ah, ah
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
Much blah, blah, blah
[Verse 1: Arcangel]
Baby
You want action
All your friends know my reputation
They say that I make it violent (auh), well hard the penetration (uuf)
They also say I'm little (ah), but I have a bug bug (wow)
You know it, they all know it, I know it too
Tell me that you are willing to do for these 100 bills
I have an entire case, and that I do not use wallet
Take advantage of the time where I come from the kids are saved even in the fridge
Baby (baby), tell me that you want to do (-Cer)
If you want to entertain (-NER), the hotel awaits us
Baby baby baby
If you want we go to the room we arrive
We turn on, we smoke, then we kill each other
(La Marash)

[Choir: Ozuna & Brytiago]
That's why when he arrives stays, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
I ask for a song of that and give it to me, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah. Nah)
Much blah, blah, blah
And he stays ah, ah (oh)
I ask for a song of that and gives it to me, ah, ah
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
Much blah, blah, blah

(Ozuna)
He says he hates me (Nah, Nah), who doesn't love me (he wants)
That I have thousands of women (haha), and that I will never change
He calls me and wants sex, I put on that
It climbs on me (above) and the process begins
The baby is never removed
I have a lot 'but e' my favorite
He gets bad and he shouts me
How do you like the moment to be repeated
Nobody can beat him although she denies it
But her best friend told me that I am the one who raises her, Yah

[Bridge: Brytiago]
Even if we have a thousand problems
You well know that in my bed we solve, baby
We are two crazy possessed 'by sex, baby
And I die with you, your body is the drug that led me to perdition
That is why you look for me because I am the one who makes you come without control

[Choir: Ozuna & Brytiago]
That's why when he arrives stays, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
I ask for a song of that and give it to me, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
Much blah, blah, blah
And he stays ah, ah (oh)
I ask for a song of that and gives it to me, ah, ah
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
Much blah, blah, blah
[Verse 3: cosculluela]
(BRR)
I do not take flowers, or odor victory
Just a baby doll pa 'when I am better modeled and has a thousand colors
Thus the bad mood takes me
I get hooked and I give it steam
I put it in four, the theater is over, today I will get terror
I harm you the day, I am glad you
This is your fantasy, without buying Dolce
I amount to you in the Porsche and we do what you want
This is to'a the night, smoking in the Panamera
Just ask me because I treat her like this
He does not want with his boyfriend, he is a wannabe
Oh, you, uh
No one does it to me like you, uh, uh, uh (haha)

[Choir: Ozuna & Brytiago]
That's why when he arrives stays, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
I ask for a song of that and give it to me, ah, ah (ah-ah-ah)
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah (Nah, Nah)
Much blah, blah, blah
And he stays ah, ah (oh)
I ask for a song of that and gives it to me, ah, ah
He says he loves me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
He says he hates me, but, Nah, Nah, Nah
Much blah, blah, blah
