ILY x11 LyricsI wanted you to know that with you by my side
You make me feel like someone special and that's hard to find
No matter where life takes us
Or who fate chooses to replace us I know we'll be alright

There's something brewing deep inside my chest
I guess it's best to express this jest before I make a mess
(Or at least a bigger one)
I know that it's hard sometimes to say how you're really feeling

So let me take this chance to clear my head
It's dead from some kind of massive limbic overload
(Or something close)
It might be lame but i'll just say what I'm really feeling
It goes like this

I love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, my love
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, my love
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, my love
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, my love

I love you!You might also likeEmbed
