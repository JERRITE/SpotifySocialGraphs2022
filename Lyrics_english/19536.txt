3 Foot Tall Lyrics[Chorus]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're three foot tall
When it's just you, well, times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Like you're three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
When there's no one to-
[Verse 1]
Stressed out, waking up and it's time to get it
In a room full of haters ain't got time for jealousy
I'm too focused on the music, the money and where I'm headed
If they rain on my parade I'm a get an umbrella, haha
Fuck all the damn opinions, never really been a one to listen
Ain't no-one else in the world saw my visions till I went the distance and stayed driven
Gotta go for it, do or die
Can't slow down, I feel too alive
I'm a chase my dream, fuck the suit and tie
If you walked in my shoes you would lose your mind
Got the blood of a champion in my veins
I ain't following nobody, I'm in my own lane
Live a day in my life, come and feel my pain
I'm ballin out like Lebron and Dwayne
In overtime, all my life, time to turn it up into overdrive
Gotta live your life with an open mind
Blood, sweat, tears got me so alive
Pull up with a bad one, and I'll pass her
Jury's out with a ass got a fat one
Used to never get money or hoes back then
Now I get both, but never really get a chance to
Wake the fuckers and the money, turn a vision to it
Embrace the struggle, and you're gonna get through it
Never give up boy, you gotta keep moving
Don't worry about me or what I'm doing
If anyone listening got a dream, better go for it
If you think about giving up better hold on
I been on my grind, hustlin' for so long
Po' up, goodbye, so I roll one
You might also like[Chorus]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're three foot tall
When it's just you, well, times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Like you're three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye aye

[Verse 2]
Waking up with the same routine
Hoping and prayin' for sunshine
If plan A don't work out, there's A through Z
Looking at rappers it's lunch time
Sick of the drugs and the groupies
Hustlin' homeboy it's crunch time
Praying to god he don't lose me
Shout out to my family one time
Putting my thoughts on a loose sleeve
I'm the Bruce Lee of this rap shit
Sometimes this life will get only colder
So go make sure that you bring a jacket
Putting my heart and my soul in this music
I came way too far to turn back, bitch
People all told me that I wouldn't make it
Now they the ones saying "congrats kid"
Used to keep money that I made from hustlin'
Right there up under my mattress
Now I ain't tripping or worry about slippin'
I got an accountant for that shit
Stood on my own two feet nothing was handed to me
Everyday I would practice
Struggling everyday trying to find myself in this world
That's filled with madness
Stressed out, working hard
Going through some shit, put my trust in god
Everybody telling me I should stop
Put my middle fingers up, screamin' fuck 'em all
Every single day of my life I'm putting up a fight
Trying to figure my rights from wrong
Hella shit on my mind, no time for the bullshit
Boy I gotta' work hard
[Chorus]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're three foot tall
When it's just you, well, times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Like you're three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Three foot tall
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Outro]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're three foot tall
When it's just you, well, times can be tough5Embed
