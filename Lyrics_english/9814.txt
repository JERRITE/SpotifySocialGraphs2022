Ride With Me Lyrics[Intro]
(KP on the beat)
You hear me?
We been
Well, I been fuckin' shit lately
(Hear that CJ on the track?)
Just listen to me

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, and let me take you on this ride with me
Can take you far, if you just cool, and let your mind be
Youngin' had it hard, stealin' cars, a gangsta he wan' be
Mama stressin' bad, was on his ass, scary site to see
[Verse 1]
Can't take da phone call, already one lost to the streets
Get on her knee's pray to the Lord, keep my baby in peace
Youngin' was wildin' out his mind, a casket he will see
Da streets don't love, but understand them bitches love me
Million dollar dreams, servin' all da dope fenes
Daddy weren't there for him, his mama showed him everything
Learned you gon eat or starve, go rat or take da charge
Just hold it down fo' a nigga, if they hold yah boy

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, and let me take you on this ride with me
Can take you far, if you just cool, and let your mind be
Youngin' had it hard, stealin' cars, a gangsta he wan' be
Mama stressin' bad, was on his ass, scary site to see

[Verse 2]
Karma catch up with you, until then, keep it cool
Man fuck da slang, do yah thang gangsta, you can't lose
Gamble what he want do, that when they kill lil' fool
On my mind daily, you don't understand what I go thru'
Bury my lil' brother, I'm not the same dude
It's hard to fucking trust, if I don't love you
Hit 'em with that bitch, watch what his soul do
Long live lil' P brother, I love you
You might also like[Chorus]
Close your eyes, and let me take you on this ride with me
Can take you far, if you just cool, and let your mind be
Youngin' had it hard, stealin' cars, a gangsta he wan' be
Mama stressin' bad, was on his ass, scary site to see

[Outro]
There probly' got some people relate to this shit
You hear me?
My music for you
You hear me?
I am you, remember that young nigga
You hear me?Embed
