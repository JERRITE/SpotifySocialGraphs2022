Until dawn Lyrics [letter from "until dawn"]

[Chorus]
What's your name'? I don't know
Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
The only thing I know what I want with you
Stay with you until dawn (huh)
What's your name'? I don't know
Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
The only thing I know what I want with you
Stay with you until dawn (huh)
[Verse 1]
Hear me, mamacita, your body and face
Brown skin, what one needs (tra)
Looking at such a beautiful girl and asked why she is so single
Come, give it there, there, moving to 'that pa' me
NO LANGUAGE NI THE PAI '
Already VÃ¡mono 'from here, that I have something good for you
An adventure night you have to live
Hear me, there, there, mommy, vamo 'to give him
Rumbeando and drink to see '
You calm that I will give you a night full of pleasure

[Chorus]
What's your name'? I don't know
Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
The only thing I know what I want with you
Stay with you until dawn (huh)

[Verse 2]
Yo-I pending you, how do you dance like this
With that movement you hypnotize
I'm getting closer to you and I tell you softly in the ear
Listen to me, mommy, I'm loved you, I feel something inside
And you tell me ': "You are very crazy, leave that"
Mommy, I'm loving you, I feel something inside
I'm dying to take you

Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
The only thing I know what I want with you
Stay with you until dawn

[Chorus]
What's your name'? I don't know
Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
All I know is that I want you
Stay with you until dawn (huh; until dawn)
What's your name'? I don't know (I don't know)
Where did you get from? I didn't even ask
The only thing I know what I want with you
Stay with you until dawn
