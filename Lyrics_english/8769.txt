Damn Duende - Live in Germany Version; 2011 Remastered Version Lyricshe heard that the night is all magic 
 And that an elf invites you to dream 
 And I know that lately I have barely stopped 
 And I have the impression of rambling

 And I do not regret yesterday 
 The stars illuminate you and serve as a guide 
 You feel so strong that you think 
 That nobody can touch you 
 The distances are short 
 The hours pass quickly 
 And this room does not stop diminishing and diminishing and diminishing 
 And so many things to say 
 So much talk here 
 If it were possible to escape this fucking place

 And I do not regret yesterday 
 The stars illuminate you and serve as a guide 
 You feel so strong that you think 
 That nobody can playyou might also likembed
