​shadowshow Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am fire, I am damage in the making
I am an army set out to control your every ticking
I am a giant stepping on the tiny world you live in

[Pre-Chorus]
And you shake and you shiver
As the roof is coming down
And the walls grow thinner

[Chorus]
Shadowshow darkens the river
Turn hearts into stone
We run, we run terrified, what have we done?
Is this how it goes?
Silence grows loudly bigger
Its heartrending crow
You run, you run terrified, what have you done?
Is this how it goes?
(Let the shadows swallow all)
It's how it goes
[Verse 2]
Mass confusion, never been so excited
What your hearts felt for us was evidently unrequited

[Bridge]
And by the sea, we’re laying down our hopes
You will conquer all
Your rise, our fall
And by the sea, I’m laying down my hopes
We will conquer all
Our rise, your fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And I shake and I shiver
As I cut through skin and bones
Can you solve the riddle?

[Chorus]
Shadowshow darkens the river
Turn hearts into stone
We run, we run terrified, what have we done?
Is this how it goes?
Silence grows loudly bigger
Its heartrending crow
(Let the shadows swallow all)
You run, you run terrified, what have you done?
Is this how it goes?
(Let the dark upon us fall)
It's how it goes
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Let the shadows swallow all
Let the dark upon us fall

[Outro]
I am fire, I am damage in the making
I am an army set out to control your every ticking11Embed
