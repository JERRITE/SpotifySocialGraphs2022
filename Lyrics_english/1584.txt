When It Comes to Us Lyrics[Verse 1: Frances]
I turn tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don't make much sense
You're unable to calm down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you're so intense

[Pre-Chorus: RITUAL]
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home
[Chorus: Frances & RITUAL]
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
When it comes to us

Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

[Verse 2: Frances]
You're too playful, and never serious
But I love you that way, yeah I love you that way
I'm too careful and always in a rush
But it's all okay, yeah it's always okay

[Pre-Chorus: RITUAL]
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home

You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
When it comes to us

Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Frances & RITUAL]
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh5Embed
