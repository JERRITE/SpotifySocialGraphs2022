My Little RnR LyricsYou look so good when you get out of bed
You're always ready to go
I caught you looking like a million bucks

When you walk out the door

You've got something they call attitude
Dripping all over the floor
Nobody says nothing, they just make their assumptions
And now you got them on all fours
Just need my fix that sticks
And all I gotta say to you is

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
And no matter what you do, I'm gonna tattoo you
On the back of my left shoulder

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
And I don't mean to brag, when you fly your flag
I salute it like I'm a soldier

You get looks when you walk down the street
Hanging off on my arm
You shake they shiver and you laugh out loud
You know when to turn on the charm

Nobody minds it and they like it alot
When you're walking down the strip
You get away with most anything
Especially when you're licking your lips

Can't give my girl the best
Cause all I gonna say to you is

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
And no matter what you do, I'm gonna tattoo you
On the back of my left shoulder
You might also likeOh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
It's never been a smooth ride with you by my side
It's like riding on a roller coaster

Aha-aha-aha-aha
Aha-aha-aha
Aha-aha-aha-aha
Aha-aha-aha

Oh baby just do what you do
Come on baby you know you never lose
You got the moves and you got that soul
'Cause you're my little rock'n roll

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
And I don't mean to brag when you fly your flag
I salute it like I'm a soldier

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
It's never been a smooth ride with you by my side
It's like riding on a roller coaster

Oh baby, you're my little rock'n roll
And no matter what you do, I'm gonna tattoo you
On the back of my left shoulderEmbed
