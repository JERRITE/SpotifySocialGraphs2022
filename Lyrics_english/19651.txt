Tony Two Phones Lyrics[Chorus]
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a reception
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a reception

[Verse 1]
Don't disrespect it, my heart so excellent
My fault, my fault, my fault I'm reckless, this shit is senseless
Weight on my shoulders like a necklace, I'm draped in blessings
I stack, I stack, I stack like Tetris, adjust your retinas
1080p, my shit in HD, my vision Blu-Ray
Your vision blurry off of D’USSÉ, you sweet like Kool-Aid
I'm on a binge, been up a few days, coulda went a few ways
I keep it pushing, I been moving
This ain't no new thing but you can
[Chorus]
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a reception
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a reception

[Verse 2]
Finna blunder off the high horse
Pride is something that you wanna die for
An eye for an eye, knife to a gun fight for
Life for a life, how you live it that's on you boy
Options, pick a few, it's several, nigga we pro-choice
Off the sick brew weak niggas can't stomach
It's a hill I'ma climb it, it's a way then I'ma find it
I'm a plus, you just a minus
We ahead, you still behind us
Top billing, headliners, call it like I see it

[Chorus]
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a reception
Call my shit a two-tone, it got two reflections
Feel like Tony Two Phones, I get no reception
I put something new on, boy ain't it a blessing
Play it broke till I blow, keep it low like a receptionYou might also like1Embed
