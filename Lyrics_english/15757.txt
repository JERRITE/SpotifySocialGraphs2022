Stories of Danzón and Arrabal Lyrics [lyrics of "Danzón and Arrabal stories"]

There are stories that are from Danzón and Arrabal
There are pleasures that drunk and know for betrayal
In the slums all lovers
Dance in the dark
And in the corners are seductions
A dance of exquisite weakness

There are neighborhood stories and living room dances
There are sins that leave the heart marked
On their knees, biting the heels
And in the mouth it carries alcohol
Lust and hallucination
They make me lose control

When the devil wants to take me
And death is around
When my soul has to deliver
Danzón and Arrabal stories

When the devil wants to take me
Condemned by temptations
When I no longer have to love
Danzón and Arrabal History

There are passions that live in brothel lights
There are loves that leave skin injuries
In the suburbs all couples
Have something to hide

Lust and hallucination
They make me lose my reason

When the devil wants to take me
And death is around
When the soul has to deliver
Danzón and Arrabal stories
You might also by breaking the devil wants me to take me
Condemned by temptations
When I no longer have to talk
Danzón and Arrabalembed History
