Secret Place (Interlude) Lyrics[Intro: Aubrey]
Uh, baby
You have no idea where we're about to go
Just sit back and enjoy the show
Are you ready

[Chorus]
I got a secret place and I wanna take you there
You got an invitation, so won't you open it
I got a secret place and I wanna take you there
You got an invitation, so won't you open it
[Verse]
I can't believe
What I'm feeling for you, it's unusual
You won't believe
How you're gonna feel when I get you alone
I can't believe
What I'm feeling for you, it's unusual
You won't believe
How you're gonna feel when I get you alone

[Chorus]
I got a secret place and I wanna take you there
You got an invitation, so won't you open it (Make me say yeah)
I got a secret place and I wanna take you there (Make me say yeah)
You got an invitation, so won't you open it (Make me say yeah)

[Outro]
Ecstasy (Make me say yeah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
