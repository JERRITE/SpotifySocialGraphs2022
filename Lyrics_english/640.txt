The Lyrics chubs [lyrics by "Los Cauchos"]

[Intro: Floor 21]
What was there, my love?
I brought the chosen, ha (get it)
21st floor (Sú-subete)
Manuel Turizo

[Pre-car: Floor 21]
It is true
Who saw her taking on the album passing her rich at two in the morning
Intonaite 'with the corduroy', huh
Yeah, but ending a song
His name came into conversation and changed his face
He says that he was bad
[Choir: 21st floor & Manuel Turizo, both]
He doesn't forget that drunk he put the chubs'
He did not think about what he lost by (no) to give it to male
Now he's looking, Yeah
He is begging him, but he is no longer for him
Sent to say with the 'boy'

[Verse 1: Manuel Turizo]
The second dish prefers to be alone
More Buita was put than it looked (I saw)
'Tá happy, he doesn't cry for a while
If you go out at night, go back day
If you want to 'see, then look' the portrait '(look' the portrait ')
Today said he didn't come back
If it were him, I swear that I don't even try
Lost gold looking for fantasy '
The star 'going down and the party turning on
If it's for me, I was kissing you
He recorded with her friend perreating, says that the penalties are forgotten by taking
E 'more' come and pégate
Do not block it
Pa 'that I see you until I divert you
Do not write to you ', better than you neither insist'
What leaves does not even come because you insist '

[Bridge: Manuel Turizo]
Although it hurts, Pa'Trá does not come back ', does not come back to the
He left her and she doesn't look at Pa'Trá ', don't look at Pa'tá', no, no (Yeah)
