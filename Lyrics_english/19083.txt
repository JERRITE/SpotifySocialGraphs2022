Baby, call yourself at 911
Of ass ’I have more than eleven (yes!)

In bikini pa 'pass the bronzer (Bronzer)
And another new pa 'when I leave the concert
You changed China 'by bottle'
And while you were 'with him, Baby, I gave that
It is one hundred, you star you '(Ajá)
And you walked in the room, but you didn't leave footprint '
And (y), I have a new ass (new ass)
In an Airbnb with her I get found (SHH)
The Babie 'leave Uber, I never carry them (Nah)

You calm, that I already gave you (say!)
You took me from asshole, but I also lied
Toíta 'your friend' in Bajita I put them

My body continues in your consciousness
And when he puts it to you, he feels the difference
Of model 'I have an agency
