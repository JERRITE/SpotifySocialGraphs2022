[Chorus]
I 'toy pa' you and you take away from me '
Devil, what a picket the shamaquita
The heart put it in the Neverita
He says that this summer stays alone
I 'toy pa' you and you take away from me '
Devil, what a picket the shamaquita
The heart put it in the Neverita
He says that this summer stays alone
[Post-car]
But never alone, alone
Loves come and go, like the wave '
The DM explodes', to's writes "Hello"
A row

[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse]
Let me spread the Sunblock pa 'that does not burn'
Here are a lot of 'beautiful girls' but you have it'
Play with me, that entertains you
Don't be 'bad, you have me meme (hey, ey, ey, ey)
I feel like the sun, hey, when you get Sunblock (when you get Sunblock)
Baby let me enter (let me in), give him, take away the lock (give me, take me the lock), he

Let me surprise you, he
Let me spread the Sunblock pa 'that does not burn'
Here are a lot of 'beautiful girls' but you have it'
Play with me, that entertains you
Don't be 'bad, you have me meme

[Chorus]
I 'toy pa' you and you take away from me '
Devil, what a picket the shamaquita
The heart put it in the Neverita
