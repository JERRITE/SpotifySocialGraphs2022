Help Me Lyrics[Intro]
Tired of it man
It's like everyday I wake up and I see darkness
Gotta find my way out of this

[Hook]
You don’t know my heart, you only see the surface
You thought you knew me cause you know all of my verses
In the dark, I am searching for my purpose
Never giving up, never quit, I’m determined
My heart, my heart
You only see the surface of
My heart, my heart
But I'm determined
[Verse 1]
Yo, would you love me if I never laid a verse again
Tell me how would you feel if I threw away my pad and pen
Thinking back to 2010
Whenever I was killing it
Acoustic, flip the switch, spit and hit a million
Black Ops rap, what a track
Wishing I could get that back
Passionate about everything I did back then but now I’m trapped
Foggy vision, moaning, pissing, all the the things I think are black
Don’t know what to do or where to go, I’m about to snap
Question my existence, always battling resistance
I’m staring at the stars wondering why I suck at living
The very air I’m breathing’s been around since the beginning
So just the fact that I’m breathing ought to leave my body spinning
Cheesy grinning, be excited, man, you get to live your dreams
You get to work from home, you drive around an H3
I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, matter fact I’m very thankful
But somewhere along the way the straight and narrow became tangled

[Hook]
You don’t know my heart, you only see the surface
You thought you knew me cause you know all of my verses
In the dark, I am searching for my purpose
Never giving up, never quit, I’m determined
My heart, my heart
You only see the surface of
My heart, my heart
But I'm determined

Stop, pause, you gotta think about what you’re doing
If you continue to neglect what you built it will be ruined
And I got a list of things I need to do but I don’t want to do them
Then why can’t I just make myself motivated, hey wake up stupid
Are you in there, are you listening
Opportunity is knocking
You used to a boss, now you’re a bitch - "What’s the problem?"
Where did your peace and patience go, anger is a toxin
I do not like what you’ve turned into, this new look is rotten
Kids are looking at you like, I need an adoption
Wifey looking at you wishing you could be forgotten
Considering her options, exercise some caution
And still I act like I am a corpse in a coffin
Zombie on some morphine, every single morning
Rise outta my bed, feel like my head is slowly warpin'
Locked inside this epidermis, blood is almost boiling
Don’t know how much longer I can take it, shit’s annoying

[Hook]
You don’t know my heart, you only see the surface
You thought you knew me cause you know all of my verses
In the dark, I am searching for my purpose
Never giving up, never quit, I’m determined
My heart, my heart
You only see the surface of
My heart, my heart
But I'm determined
[Verse 3]
Gimme pills, give me something, I’ll do anything at all
Maryjane to soothe my attitude, that or alcohol
Grew up thinking that I could hear Jesus whenever he would talk
But now when I ask him for help he won’t return my call
Maybe he’s out of minutes, either that or he’s a figment
And I’ve been trying to understand but I can’t figure out religion
All I wish is I could run away, and start over again
Find my confidence, no consequences, I’m at a dead end
Gimme pills, give me something, I can feel it in my chest
Anxiety has got a hold on me, my heart is such a mess
I’m possessed, this is crazy, where’s my peace where’s the safety
Surely that would silence all the thoughts that agitate me
I'm to afraid to quit, I can’t let anyone down
So I hide behind the mask, put on an act, like I’m a clown
But when the show is over and and the bags have all been packed
Is there anyone who wonders if the clown has yet to laugh

[Hook x2]
You don’t know my heart, you only see the surface
You thought you knew me cause you know all of my verses
In the dark, I am searching for my purpose
Never giving up, never quit, I’m determined

[Outro]
My heart, my heart
You only see the surface of
My heart, my heart
