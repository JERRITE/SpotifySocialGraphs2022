Today it hurts to say
What is happening to me
I gave my heart
And I was cheating

My friend, I told you
But you went along the path of the bottle
To forget her
Not with a tequila drink
I could cure the wounds
Not with a brandy
I take her out of my mind

That whiskey helps and is a lie
You know all the canteens
And the more brandy
She is more present

Tell me how I do
To forget her
If I'm already called
Why don't you leave me?

Don't be so bad drinks
Don't drink more beer
Better follow the party
Look for another more beautiful

It seems to me that it has become impossible
Get it out of my head
APPEARS IS NOT INTERESTED
Wanting with bottles this sadness
Today I get drunk and this is just beginning
You might Also Likela Fiesta Follow, bottles asks
Because she lives in the land of Carlos Vives forgotten
Drink until the name forgot

Oh tell me, how do I
To forget her
If I'm already called
Why don't you leave me?

Don't be so bad drinks
Don't drink more beer
Better follow the party
Look for another more beautiful

When a love leaves
Going going Gone
For me it is very easy to say
For you it is difficult to understand

That a love leaves
Going going Gone
It is best to let it go
And accept that I had to lose

Today it hurts to say
What is happening to me
I gave my heart
And I was cheating
My friend, I told you
But you went along the path of the bottle
To forget her

Not with a tequila drink
I could cure the wounds
Not with a brandy
I take her out of my mind

That whiskey helps and is a lie
You know all the canteens
And the more brandy
She is more present

Oh tell me, how do I
To forget her
If I'm already called
Why don't you leave me?

Don't be so bad drinks
Don't drink more beer
Better follow the party
Look for another more beautiful

Yeah
There is nothing like a brandy
To calm the penalties
