Tangerine Skies Lyrics[Intro]
(1, 2, 3)

[Verse 1]
Losing days and working nights
Watch the hours ticking by
Funny how we drift apart
Keep the pace and drown distress
5 AM, Tesco Express
I can't help but miss your heart (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't you call me like you used to?
Call me like you used to?
Take me back where we left off
'Cause I ain't grown into these shoes
Yt feel like I could use
One more summer before I grow up

[Chorus]
So please take my hand and let's press rewind
We can light up the sparks in our eyes
Let's just be stupid for one more night
While we dance under tangerine skies

[Post-Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
While we dance under tangerine skies
Hey now, hey now
(While we dance under tangerine skies)

[Verse 2]
Driving down familiar coasts
Saying nothing, talking loads
We could do this all the time
The sky is full of UFOs
Tomorrow is far, let's keep it close
As long as you stay, I'll be fine (Yeah)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So come and hold me like you used to
Hold me like you used to
Take me back where we left off
'Cause I ain't grown into these shoes
Yet feel like I could use
One more summer before I grow up

[Chorus]
So please take my hand and let's press rewind
We can light up the sparks in our eyes
Let's just be stupid for one more night
While we dance under tangerine skies

[Post-Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
While we dance under tangerine skies
Hey now, hey now
While we dance under tangerine skies

[Bridge]
So light it up, take me out and feel the sun
Light it up, take me out and feel the sun

[Chorus]
Please take my hand and let's press rewind
We can light up the sparks in our eyes
Let's just be stupid for one more night
While we dance under tangerine skies
[Post-Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
While we dance under tangerine skies
Hey now, hey now
While we dance under tangerine skies
While we dance under tangerine skies1Embed
