(Ha)
Hmm, yo
(Ha), (Baby, you're that)

[Verse 1]
Nails shine like Christmas
Heels on six inches (Yeah)
Waist cinched, Mugler fit
You can't have this, you can't hit this
[Refrain]
I got a new man in my business
And he all about his business
And his name ain't none of your business
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Pin up girl on that poster
Say so like I'm Doja
Icy, Wifey
Body shape Coca-Cola

[Refrain]
I got a new man in my business (Aw)
And he all about his business
And his name ain't none of your business
(Oh, oh, oh) (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
Let them know
Oh baby, let them know
'Cause they can run they mouth
But I’ma stand and pose for you
Let them know
Go ahead and flip that switch
No, they can't beat you down
'Cause baby you're that bitch

I stay up on my queen shit
Up here the haters look teeny tiny (Oh)

Let them know
Oh baby, let them know
