GENGAR LYrics is a ghost like a GENGAR, toxic kush on a bench 
 Simba tell me, in the city where I fly with Fart 
 I don't have time, my Demogorgon is chasing me 
 Like Daredevil - I can't see, but I will find sense 
 Cypis is not going, I don't listen to what Popek is talking 
 As much kitsch as I fired a snapchat 
 Like Dexter Morgan, I still feel this void 
 I do what I like, but I feel this void 
 I can't fall asleep, fucking in my lid again 
 Such a silence that the bit squeaks in the ears 
 I'm going around the city, the future flies on old headphones 
 You take this smoke - Mask Off, Dziwko 
 New music is the Brandi Love butt 
 And my nigga who took her from behind 
 I have a dream, become an exclusive tracksuit 
 Put a good beca into your pocket, elo I'm flying 
 My life - a series, although Netflix did not do me 
 I hear blablabla, I don't know what the whore is about 
 What France? Unless you kneel 
 I will record a beautiful song in my throat
