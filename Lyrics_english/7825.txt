Traffic Lyrics[Intro: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action (that action)
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic (skrrt)
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action (that action)
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage (let's get it)
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap (bitch we clap)
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic (as a tragic)
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic (dramatic)
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards (let's get it)
[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Letting a nigga goon me, I can't imagine (no)
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic (skrrt)
My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it (man down)
My niggas do it for me, ain't no way around it (let's get it)
Blood hound for that money, bitch I gotta have it
Going crazy, 20's, 50's, 100's, bitch I'm cashing (I'm cashing)
And I ain't really with the talking, bitch I'm money stacking (let's get it)
And he ain't really bout' that life, cause he don't love that action (that action)
And they don't come from where I come from, they wasn't born a savage (savage)
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic (skrrt)
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin' (no)

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action (that action)
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic (skrrt)
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action (that action)
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage (let's get it)
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap (bitch we clap)
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic (as a tragic)
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic (dramatic)
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards (let's get it)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
We don't really play, homie we about gun action (bang bang)
Pistols get to flappin', ball like the Mavericks (swish)
Chief Keef bitch I'm savage, I'm paper stackin' (Sosa baby)
Pistols get to clappin', niggas get to lappin' (bang bang)
Bad bitches packed up inside a Maxima (yeah)
That bitch gon' give me neck, neck like a Dracula (top)
Fuck nigga talk shit, delete him, no schedule (graah)
That bitch want some ransom, she say I'm handsome (beep)
I need me a dancer to come and dance up (let's get it)
On me while I'm wildin' and I'm throwing sets up (O'Block)
I need me a dancer to come and dance up (let's get it)
On me while I'm wildin' and throwing sets up (300)
