A kiss lyrics [lyrics by "a kiss"]

[English Translation]

[Pre-Caro: Romeo Santos]
There is a woman, who dominates my senses just by touching my skin
And as me too, another man can happen to another man

[Choir: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
That just for a kiss can fall in love
No need to speak, only the lips rub
Cupid will arrow them
And just for a kiss with her I'm happy
Just with a little kiss, he took me to infinity
And I don't even know her well
[Post-car: Romeo Santos]
A kiss means: friendship, sex and love
Anywhere in the world, no matter religion
For a kiss from his mouth I go to heaven and talk to God
I reach the stars of emotion

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
His mouth is so sensual
Captivates me and excites me, I don't get tired of kissing
His language is my weakness (weakness)
She knows the tricks, tell me if there is someone else

[Choir: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
That just for a kiss can fall in love
No need to speak, only the lips rub
Cupid will arrow them
And just for a kiss with her I'm happy
Just with a little kiss, he took me to infinity
And I don't even know her well

[Post-car: Romeo Santos]
A kiss means: friendship, sex and love
Anywhere in the world, no matter religion
For a kiss from his mouth I go to heaven and talk to God
I reach the stars of emotion
