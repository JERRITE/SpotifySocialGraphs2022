Roll Me Up Lyrics[Intro]
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon

[Chorus]
And don't you worry bout me I'll be fine
I'll see everybody on the upside
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
I'm alright, don't you cry
Everybody just get high
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
[Verse 1]
I feel the darkness oh no lord
The darkness I go towards
I really want freedom
But I ain't selling my soul for it
I can't afford it, I feel it's too expensive
Pray to God that I'm forgiven, Lord this is my repentance
And my momma taught me better, sang Amazing Grace
I came to fame, to trade the pain, for razor blades, to cut loose
A must do. I take a stand
If it's fuck you, its fuck you cause I'm a
Man and we don't respond well to bully tactics
Before you try us just know that the whole team is fully savage
No weapons formed against me will ever prosper
Watch how you keep talkin'
Just know I'm off my rocker

[Chorus]
And don't you worry bout me I'll be fine
I'll see everybody on the upside
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
I'm alright, don't you cry
Everybody just get high
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die

All of the sudden they askin me how I'm feeling
I'm sick of explaining myself I'm Bob Dylan
I started at the floor but I think I hit the ceiling
Either die the hero or live long enough to be the villain
The good die young like Jimi, Croce
And Hendrix probably blow right past it not even knowin' the limit
Paranoid, blowing weed smoke
Staring out the peep hole
Feeling like my legacy is tainted like I'm Pete Rose
And I don't wanna die yet
But if I do remember me for stacking
Up my checks
And my southern dialect
God loves the gangsters and fuck-ups
Be careful what you say, there are angels amongst us

[Chorus]
And don't you worry bout me I'll be fine
I'll see everybody on the upside
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
I'm alright, don't you cry
Everybody just get high
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
[Outro]
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoon
I see the moon in the middle of the afternoonEmbed
