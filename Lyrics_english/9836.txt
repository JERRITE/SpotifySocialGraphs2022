Goon Music Lyrics[Hook: Max B]
Gain green, we wavy
Money we holding
Them bitches, we fucks them
Until their pussies is swollen
Ten thousand tickets
Got caught with a blunt
Fuck it, I paid it
I park anywhere I want-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 1: Max B]
It ain't hard to tell
You ain't fuckin' with Bigavell
Still on the billion dollar bail
Wait, do some other shit
Motherfuckers is coming quick
Biga Daddy, I want it, never flip
I want it, never hit hit cause they thirsty
Tryna jerk me but you missed out
Mami got her tits out, papi got the 6 out
That's not papi, that's Velli
Clear out, clear the route when I come through
'bout to steal the show from the big names on your bill
Let me show you what we next to kill, sex appeal
Bitches love the dick, they can't help it
Margarine stick on your tongue, mami I'm melting
You're welcome
Who helped him?
Beat past me, I was fast
Nigga but you lack class
Black mask, gloves for the robbery, do this shit in and out
Many packages I be sending out
[Hook: Max B]
Gain green, we wavy
Money we holding
Them bitches, we fucks them
Until their pussies is swollen
Ten thousand tickets
Got caught with a blunt
Fuck it, I paid it
I park anywhere I want-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2: French Montana]
We spend what you made, three times that
Niggas wrinkle up they face on the detox that
Ask Dre, I got detox wrapped in my whip off top
Yeah homie, I freestyled that
And yeah I see the hate, but I see past that
Man niggas can't copy, my shit [?]
Matter fact, nigga get with or get rolled over
On the grind, can't get a day sober
Break's over, goon music takeover
Cocaine and that coke wave makeover
I done seen real niggas fold over
When the pressure on tight niggas tellin' on sight
Like Biggo, bricks in vehicle
Montana, head crack [?]
It's two thangs, I'm a shooter like Luol Deng
Goon music, top of the food chain
You might also like[Bridge: French Montana]
Max is wavy, Grease be rollin'
Nigga take your dough, fuck them hoes
Take your time
Goon music baby, picture me rollin'
Homie take your dough, fuck them hoes
Take your time

[Verse 3: Dame Grease]
Let me tell you 'bout a real OG
Harlem boy just born in to move keys
I rob and I steal, I kill at will
The boy used to get her often, always known for flossing
Fucked up a few mill, watch him make a billy back
Known as a gangsta, I'ma sell these where it's really at
New York City, grind and we gritty
[?] up on the school tracks, always make a few stacks

[Verse 4: Meeno]
Got them bricks, them bundles, them P's
What a nigga thought they wasn't gon' see me?
Please, I go off on beats like these
Keep a hoodrat with a pocket full of cheese
Grease told me come on, mama I made it
When Bigavelli come on, he make it so wavy
I'ma let the gun off, let the drummer drum off
I got to go but Snaps 'bout to come on
[Verse 5: E-Snaps]
Tell everybody look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No it's me motherfucker, I'm a G motherfucker
Feel good to be E, that's me, word to mother
Get up in that ass for all sorts of cash
Y'all know when it's problems handle it like Nash
Ain't worried 'bout the problems, automatics will blast him
I'm a goon slash gorilla, bazooka straight through ya
I do ya, tell your boys papi did it to ya1Embed
