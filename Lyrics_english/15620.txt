Until counting a thousand lyrics [lyrics of the song "until counting a thousand"]

(Uuuuhhh-uh-uuuhhh)
Since you left, I don't want to eat
Well, nothing feeds me
Since you left I can not dream
And I sleep awakens
I have the anorexic heart of love
And love torments him
I tremble my brain, my reason trembles
And you calm me
Since you left I can't breathe
Well, your demons suffocate me
Since you left, I can't talk
Well, you silence my life
You think you dominate and control heat
That my soul burns
Then hurt me and want to apologize
And never regret
Ohhhhhhh

And you know that I
Would kill me for you
And I would be born again
Would reincarnate in you
I would build an altar
To pray for you
Then I would make love
Until counting a thousand

Since you left my identity I lost
And I can't find it
Since you are not no longer concentration
And I can't think
I have anorexico the damn heart
And my soul melts
I want you to return and give us a forgiveness
I am dying inside
You might also like is that you know that I
Would kill me for you
And I would be born again
Would reincarnate in you
I would build an altar
To pray for you
Then I would make love
Until counting a thousand

(Yoooooo) you know that I would kill myself for you
(I would kill me for you) I would look for you in eternity
(And would be born again) I would reincarnate only for you
(I would reincarnate in you) I would hide you anywhere
(I would build an altar) and so that no one can find you
(To pray for you) With me you just want to stay
(Then would love you) I would die if you are not
(Until counting a thousand) You know that I die for you

Since you left I don't want to live
I really do not interest me1embed
