TranslationsPortuguÃªsEasy For You To Say Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
I see it in moments, it's comin' in waves
A sunrise in Sydney that's burnin' for days
But I'm headstrong and stubborn and stuck in my ways
With every tomorrow, keep turnin' the page
A youth that was stolen and filled with mistakes
I turned all around, looked for someone to blame
But I'm overdramatic and drenched in my pain
I know that you saw it all over my face

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Last night, I lied
I looked you in the eyes
I'm scared to find
A piece of peace of mind
I swear to you
Each and every time
I'll try and change my ways
[Chorus: Luke]
Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say

[Verse 2: Luke & Calum]
I feel it in moments, a semblance of free
Between all the gaspin', I finally breathe
So I hold on so tightly in times that I see
Someone with striking resemblance to me
A darkness that holds me and loves when I bleed
It locks all the doors and then hides all the keys
Wish someone had told me what I couldn't see
A glimmer of hope that was starin' at me

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
Last night, I lied
I looked you in the eyes
I'm scared to find
A piece of peace of mind
I swear to you
Each and every time
I'll try and change my ways

Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Luke & Michael]
Last night, I lied
I looked you in the eyes
I'm scared to find
A piece of peace of mind
I swear to you
Each and every time
I'll try and change my ways

[Chorus: All]
Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say
Harder for me to take
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say
[Outro: Luke]
This nostalgia in my bones
Why can't I forget it?
Easy for you to say
This nostalgia in my bones
Easy for you7Embed
