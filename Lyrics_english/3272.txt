Tiimmy Turner - Remix Lyrics [lyrics by "Tiimmy Turner - Remix"]

[Chorus]
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner with my blacks do not fuck
With the green and with the rose the slab breaks down you
Even if you look at me and think that I can't live on this
For my still, I don't know how to deserve it, I deserve it

Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner with my blacks do not fuck
With the green and with the rose the slab breaks down you
Even if you look at me and think that I can't live on this
For my still, I don't know how to deserve it, I deserve it
[Verse]
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
I hope they improve, that Wanda makes me favors
While Cosmo brings flowers
'Tamo' trafficing pollen with wands and flavors
ReMi, Full Box Wait with money and bullion
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner, I wish islands with three boats
The babysitter chases me because mom is not at home, I was with the kids
Burning on the terrace without magic survive
The pixies talk to whatsapp when the detective arrives
Try to find the mass brought from the magical world
I smoke a dry and I'm going to a fantastic place
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner, dressed in pink cap
My sharp palettes to spit good prose
All my people dances her at the pass of Chip Skylark
I have the crazy muffin, brother, I won it on my birthday
I asked that what I get is fulfilled in a few years
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner

[Chorus]
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner, with my blacks do not fuck
With the green and with the rose, the slab breaks down
Even if you look at me and think that I can't live on this
Pa 'mi still doesn't matter, total, I know I deserve it

With the green and with the rose, the slab breaks down
Even if you look at me and think that I can't live on this
Pa 'mi still doesn't matter, total, I know I deserve it
