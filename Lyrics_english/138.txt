[Enter: Pusha t]
You are supposed to put the first five hundred in the safe and lose the combination
The neck and wrist do not lie
The neck and wrist do not lie

[Chorus: pusha t & pharrell williams]
First on the beach with a car of one million dollars
Bring the cameraman, we can film our own narco
812 Black, it looks coal
I promise that the plant plane does not look anything like the model
The cuеllo and the wrist do not lie
The cuеllo and the wrist do not lie
[Verse 1: pusha t]
The money counter ding is so exciting
Summertime, Winterfell, I'm the king of the night
The Colgate kilo, the block needs whitening (skrrt)
We are blacks with fish scales like all pisces
Your bitch in my bubble as if I were still writing
She expects you to let her go like a comet rope
Your jewelers are eco-friendly, keep recycling
Cartier's arrests are not my thing
The B at the center of that left and right wing
The only time you will see me next to Breitling (Skrrt)
I wonder where this began, the facts are terrifying
Richard Pryor's flame gave light impossible dreams, now we are here

[Chorus: pusha t & pharrell williams]
First on the beach with a car of one million dollars
Bring the cameraman, we can film our own narco
812 Black, it looks coal
I promise that the plant plane does not look anything like the model
The neck and wrist do not lie
The neck and wrist do not lie

[Post-Stribillo: Pharrell Williams]
And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line
And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line
And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line
And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line
(And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line)
(And the drug house had a line, the drug house had a line)

The phase in which I am, love, I would not believe it either
It would be like, "Jay-Z is a cheater," I wouldn't hear reasons either
All I know is that he is a criminal, how is it being sold?
Grass, the Caliva brothers, deep down, I think you love us, huh
Delight your eyes, the piece is unique, it is sapphire
Rappers liars, I don't get satire
Neither me nor my doll move mockingly
All spend real money on false watches, surprisingly
They put me in lists with these blacks inexplicably
I put your mansion on my wall, are you screwing me?
I blow the bird's money, all of you are talking about Twitter
We have different stories from Saab, keep your soliloquios
They like, "if Big was alive, Hov wouldn't be in his position"
If Big had survived, you would have obtained the commission
Hov was always going to be Hov
It was the universe because Allah said it, and now I am here

[Chorus: pusha t & pharrell williams]
First on the beach with a car of one million dollars
Bring the cameraman, we can film our own narco
812 Black, it looks coal
I promise that the plant plane does not look anything like the model
The neck and wrist do not lie
The neck and wrist does not lie
