Hello Cotto Lyrics ["hello cotto" letter]]

[Intro]
Brown!
Gang, Damn, Esskeetit, Wuh-Uh! (Prrra!)
Money, Money, Damn, Damn
Bullet, Bullet, PRRA, PRRA!

[Pre-stribe]
I drowned in why I have a broken heart for a long time (broken heart, broken)
But, well, what my thing, I have this mania that has me very crazy (which is very crazy, crazy)
'Tamo' in Floría and I have a Mary that is a lotus flower (which is a lotus flower, lotus)
Take care, who hits as Cotto (Cotto)
Take care, who hits as Cotto (Cotto)
[Chorus]
I have the 'hand' empty
If there is a piggy, say where I explode it
Fuck the Police, the CIA follows me
If you are listening to me: "Hello, Moto"
They want medicine 'e laughing, they look for it
Tell me how much I write it down
Take care
Take care

[Verse 1]
My Music hits Cotto (Cotto)
Like Molly, powerful (-Saver; Ah)
Used, I'm Floto (Floto)
As if I take the rose (prra)
Your remote control gangsters (what?)
They speak a lot and do little (na ', na')
For me they are not much (na ', na')
If they throw me, don't
Always face for the photo (blin ')
I never know what happens (na ', na')
This lying that weighs me (weighs; haha)
The madness is not passed (it passes)
Anxiety so much stress (strip ')
That from now on at home (ah)
With GTA as a pilot, take care of, who hits as cotto
I am the 'kids of the background (UH), of the addict' to the quilombo (UH)
Better do not launch with my combo (more na ')
They are 'crazy' and I don't oppose (pum-pum)
They don't name me, I don't name them (I don't name them)
With my men to the shoulder '(the shoulder')
They go to the envelope, I do not so much (I do not so much)
From poor to rich as Rondo (Rondo)
They already know me as the monster
My flow doesn't fit my face
I am Jesus or I am Apostle
Or I'm from Bronx or I'm from Boston
The seed is not rice, toy
You give it fire that this is popcorn
Golden buns, pure porn
I'm not drugged, I'm in the oven
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
And what they say about me does not care na '(nothing, nothing)
And what they say of me has me without care, -a'o, ah-ah-ah, a'o, oh

[Pre-stribe]
I drowned in why I have a broken heart for a long time (broken heart)
But, well, what my thing, I have this mania that has me very crazy (which is very crazy, crazy)
'Tamo' in Floría and I have a Mary that is a lotus flower, lotus
Take care, who hits like Cotto, Cotto
Take care, who hits like Cotto, Cotto

[Chorus]
I have the 'hand' empty
If there is a piggy, say where I explode it
Fuck the Police, the CIA follows me
If you are listening to me: "Hello, Moto"
They want medicine 'e laughing, they look for it
Tell me how much I write it down
Take care, who hits as Cotto (Cotto)
Take care, who hits as Cotto (Cotto)

[Verse 2]
Ask for the scene that fractures it (fracture, fracture; ey)
That is paste, is the one that most billed (invoice, invoice)
What to criticize? Better more mature (ah; mature, mature)
The mind to win as Yaya Touroé (ey; Touro)
There is no being that this evil does not cure (cure)
I wanted to change but, ma ', I couldn't (I could)
They are worried about my auto-tune (tune; ah-ah)
And I for the penalty of so much 'Lune' (Lune '; ah-ah)
Mama only asks that I don't smoke (I don't smoke)
It does not serve as na 'that in vain jure (jure)
Do things that I couldn't (I could) long ago
Duki shoots although Mauro Dude (Dude)
I am the child 'the year, Morocho Achinado
I wear double pipe, polarized flow
What's up with your click? Do you have a lawyer '?
Call it to mock that I am mockery
CORONÉ BOTELA 'with the first payment
In the second Zapa ', in the third gram'
With the room the kilo, do we see what we are talking about?
With a little 'e style here to' achieve it '
I have them outside with the dog tied
Wait for Street to get a bite
And it's not that I don't hear her for being spoiled
Here everyone lies and I am distrustful
That I get the bug, I'm mallandized
Bando E 'Venezuela is for my side
With study 'payments and I'm not a scholarship
I do not wear a cross but I live crossed (PRRA, PRRA, PRRA!)
[Pre-stribe]
I drowned in why I have a long broken heart
But, well, what my thing, I have this mania that has me very crazy
'Tamo' in Floría and I have a Mary that is a lotus flower
Take care
Take care

[Chorus]
I have the 'hand' empty
If there is a piggy, say where I explode it
Fuck the Police, the CIA follows me
If you are listening to me: "Hello, Moto"
They want medicine 'e laughing, they look for it
Tell me how much I write it down
Take care
Take care
