Paid Up Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Chorus]
Three bad bitches on my dick, so now we laid up (Now we laid up)
Won't let 'em use my name unless I'm getting paid up (Getting paid up)
Bronem let the toolie bang whenever he get fed up (Boom, boom)
Nigga, you a stain, you and your bros'll get set up (Get set up)
Three bad bitches on my dick, so now we laid up (Lil' bitch)
Won't let 'em use my name unless I'm getting paid up (Getting paid up)
Bronem let the toolie bang whenever he get fed up (He get fed up)
Nigga, you a stain, you and your bros'll get set up
[Verse 1]
Uh-uh, I got bands, more than fifty (More than fifty)
Gotta pay to come see me (Come see me)
Uh, met a bad bitch from Miami (From Miami)
She licking on me like some candy (Like some candy)
I just talked to my bro, he said, "Someone save me"
And it's crazy, I feel like no one can change me (Change)
Now I got a lot of bread, and I'm still the same me
And I went to my city, and it's still the same (Still the same)
I was in my city, some bitch, she tried to play me (Tried to play me)
I just left LA with some bands, this shit is crazy (Shit crazy)
And you stupid bad, but you cannot have my baby (Uh)
And it's so sad 'cause these niggas try to hate me

[Chorus]
Three bad bitches on my dick, so now we laid up (Now we laid up)
Won't let 'em use my name unless I'm getting paid up (Getting paid up)
Bronem let the toolie bang whenever he get fed up (Boom, boom)
Nigga, you a stain, you and your bros'll get set up (Get set up)
Three bad bitches on my dick, so now we laid up (Lil' bitch)
Won't let 'em use my name unless I'm getting paid up (Getting paid up)
Bronem let the toolie bang whenever he get fed up (He get fed up)
Nigga, you a stain, you and your bros'll get set up

[Verse 2]
I was fuckin' with a bitch, but she was playin' (She playin')
Tried to take my racks, bitch, is you crazy? (Is you crazy?)
I just love the money, got these bands on me daily (On me daily)
Pour a cup of lean, in the Masi goin' crazy (Of the lean)
I was in bro crib whippin' baby on the daily (On the daily)
I was hittin' licks, but this rap shit saved me
I be cashin' out, had to restock on the whole thing (On the whole)
Now I got these bands, these niggas mad 'cause they ain't me (Why you mad?)
You a broke nigga tryna ride 'round with my crew (With my crew)
I just got a check, watch me skrrt off in a coupe, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt)
All my niggas ballin', we got brothers on that tool, ayy (Uh-uh)
Sippin' on that Wock', all my niggas got that juice (Uh-uh)
