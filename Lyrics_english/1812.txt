Places We Wonâ€™t Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sunlight dances off the leaves
Birds of red color the trees
Flowers filled with buzzin' bees
In places we won't walk

Neon lights shine bold and bright
Buildings grow to dizzy heights
People come alive at night
In places we won't walk
[Chorus]
Children cry and laugh and play
Slowly hair will turn to gray
We will smile to end each day
In places we won't walk

[Verse 2]
Family look on in awe
Petals decorate the floor
Waves gently stroke the shore
In places we won't walk

[Chorus]
Children cry and laugh and play
Slowly hair will turn to gray
We will smile to end each day
In places we won't walkYou might also like3Embed
