Your little angel lyrics [intro]
[?]

[Verse 1]
Your face is a work of art, your mouth the most beautiful mouth
Your eyes the look of an angel, of an angel
You are a pretty little thing, it makes me easy to fall in love
You have a beautiful face of Angel

[Chorus]
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love is me
A GIFT OF GOD
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love, affectionate
[Post-stribe]
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh

[Verse 2]
I am a faithful addict to your presence, ah, ah
I don't know if your innocence attracted me, ah, ah
What I know is that you have no competition, ah, ah
That's why I wait for you patiently, ah, ah
When I remember your beautiful eyes
I just imagine the blessed angels,
That is why I think and I beg you to say that if
If I invite you to an appointment

[Pre-stribe]
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well

[Chorus]
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love is me
A GIFT OF GOD
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love, affectionate
[Post-stribe]
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh

[Bridge]
You know that I am your little angel
And you, you, you are my queen, you are my queen

[See 3]
I want to dance with you flying
Have your hair moving
Talk close
Tell you what I'm feeling
When I remember your beautiful eyes
I only imagine the blessed angels
That is why I think and I beg you to tell me that if
If I invite you to an appointment

[Pre-stribe]
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
That's why they see, come, come that I port my well
[Chorus]
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love is me
A GIFT OF GOD
Your little angel is me
Your blessed love, affectionate

[Post-stribe]
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh
I am your angel, your little angel, whoa, oh

[Outro]
That's why they see, come, come with little angel
That's why they see, come, come with little angel
That's why they see, come, come with little angel
That's why they see, come, come with Angelitoembed
