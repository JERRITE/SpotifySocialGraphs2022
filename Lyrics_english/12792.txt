Lo-Fi Children Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, I get this feeling in my heart some days, whoa, uh-oh-uh-oh
This kind of feeling doesn't need X-rays
Oh, my darling, darling, darling
Oh, if I knew what to say when we met we could
But my lips are locking, locking
I take a risk when I try to be understood

[Pre-Chorus]
I've drawn too close to let go now
[Chorus]
Guaranteed chemistry
I'm not lying, only dying
Spending time without you's cheap
Nothing's free
If we meet someday, we'll never need to change
The beat of growing streets
No place can urbanize our lives
It'd make my night to get to know your way around the block
I'll leave it up to you

[Verse 2]
Can't help staring when you make it through the rain on time, whoa, uh-oh-uh-oh
Thunderstorming, yet you look just fine
Oh, I'm falling, falling, falling
It wouldn't be half as bad if nobody knew
Yet, I'm stalling, stalling, stalling
Oh, if I wait any more, I'll be overdue

[Pre-Chorus]
Got something to compete for you

[Chorus]
Guaranteed chemistry
I'm not lying, only dying
Spending time without you's cheap
Nothing's free
If we meet someday, we'll never need to change
The beat of growing streets
No place can urbanize our lives
It'd make my night to get to know your way around the block
I'll leave it up to you
Ooh, aah
You might also like[Bridge]
If I arrive before you're gone
And you're right where you belong
Inside that warehouse in a loft your family bought
I have a letter that I wrote
Wanna take you out before
That rotten boy from school comes knockin' at your door
Lately, I can't get you off my mind
Can't get over just how you're designed
Since your face, I can't help being kind
Take my thoughts of you and press rewind

[Chorus]
Guaranteed chemistry
I'm not lying, only dying
Spending time without you's cheap
Nothing's free
If we meet someday, we'll never need to change
The beat of growing streets
No place can urbanize our lives
It'd make my night to get to know your way around the block
I'll leave it up to you2Embed
