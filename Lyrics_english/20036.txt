Pdl lyrics [verse 1]
Points "i", bars the "t"
You rugs in "i", glue the joints in t
Ball in VIP, opium in tea
I'm distant, I'm next to it
I have moon dust
Moon dust
Sniff The Moon Dust
Moon dust
I like clothes clothes there on site
(I like fairly classy clothes)
I'm going to put Chinchilla on you
On London it sounds like on you
The cymbals flutter on me
Oy oy, oy oy, the flow tah la rive, boy
90's like Tony, Boy
I go fast, quickly as an ovni, boy
Boy, there's color in my ice cubes
If I see shapes in the pants
It will flow like the Euphon
[Bridge]
(Baby, Baby)
Moon dust
(Baby, Baby)
Moon dust
(Bab-Ba-Ba-Baby)
Moon dust
(Bab ', Ba-Bab', Baby)
Moon dust

[Verse 2]
There is, there is dust on open mouth
I have the cake, there is no cover
L.D.O in the room, it comes all green
I'm going to ace like Serena on the reverse
Bang, Bang, yeah she touched me
Wake up, fucked up, we fuck and will buy me
The room revolves around me and moves the floor
Flow, is wet on speakers, not waterproof and
Lease, lease, lease, I can't lie
I'm looking for real, you're trying to lie
I have dust, I may destroy it
