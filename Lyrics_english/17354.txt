Lay Down Lyrics[Chorus]
Look, all of that woofin' like you 'bout that shit
Better stop that shit
Bitch I got something to make you lay down
Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, going through a nigga mind
When I'm loadin' up them K rounds
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round
[Verse 1]
Look, fuck boy we ain't gon' play round
Lurkin', itchin' for for a killin'
When I catch a nigga, I'ma leave him face down
AK eat a fuck nigga body
Eating everything but the waste down
I'm getting high off gunpowder
See you on the way down
Look, you ain't talking money then I can't stay round
Ain't fuckin' with no lame nigga
Niggas tip the system then they wanna break down
Go to jail, break down, fuck no
Bitch I'ma lay down
I'm worried bout clowns actin like real niggas
Man, fuck a fake clown
Pulled up on him at the gas station
Nigga thought I was playin'
I got the pump but you see big fire coming out that Phant
What about that time I walked out on you in front of yo clan?
He pushed you in the gate
Fore you came we had an understandin'
That boy ain't really yo man

[Chorus]
All of that woofin' like you 'bout that shit
Better stop that shit
Bitch I got something to make you lay down
Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, going through a nigga mind
When I'm loadin' up them K rounds
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round

Ay, riding round with fed cases
Murk a nigga for a couple dead faces
Fuck yo baby momma ain't no sympathy
I hope she have a dead baby
Niggas wanna tell the police everything
Well tell em how that lead tasting
I've been in the streets no sleep
Told em that he ain't seen the dead lately
I've been trippin', poppin' fifties
I remember I ain't have a pot to piss in
Partners kick it in the trenches
Nigga trippin'? Grab the Glock
And pop the stick in
Murder mission pop a jigga
Smoke a black wait for my high to kick in
Rob a nigga flat broke
He shake back?
Then I'm gon' rob him again
All of that woofin like you bout that shit
Better stop that shit, I'll pop that bitch
Slide through your block, murk a nigga
Then I'm out that bitch
Look, all of that woofin' like you bout that shit
Better stop that shit, I'll pop that bitch
Slide through your block, murk a nigga
Then I'm out that bitch
[Chorus]
All of that woofin' like you 'bout that shit
Better stop that shit
Bitch I got something to make you lay down
Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, going through a nigga mind
When I'm loadin' up them K rounds
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round
And we gon' ride through that pussy nigga block
One of these nights and let em have it
Fuck boy, we ain't gon' play round2Embed
