There is no need to need to look at me 
 You don't need to say it 
 You don't need to explain me 
 When you cry or laugh 
 You don't have to say that I want to die 
 By your side, I love you 

 You don't need to stay 
 It is not necessary to insist you 
 I don't need to cry you 
 If we will see each other 
 You don't have to say that I want to die 
 By your side, I love you 
 We don't have to dream 
 What is a lie that there is no death when there is love 
 This same story continues 
 Just change the stage 
 In the love scene 

 You don't need to look at me 
 You don't need to say it 
 You don't need to explain me 
 When you cry or laugh 
 You don't have to say that I want to die 
 By your side, I love you 

 We don't have to dream 
 What is a lie that there is no death when there is love 
 This same story continues 
 Just change the stage 
 In the love scene 

 I don't need to insist me 
 I don't need to cry you 
 If we see each other 
 I don't have to say that I love myself 
 Die by your side, you amoyou might also likembed
