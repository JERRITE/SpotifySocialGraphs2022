Are You In Love With A Notion? Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam Fray]
Run away from this God forsaken place
And hide away from everybody's prying face
You told Deborah that he is the one
You're going to quit Debenhams
Elope and get married in the sun
[Chorus]
Have you really thought this through?
Is he really the one for you?
Why are you so in love with
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all
Why are you so in love with
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all
[Verse 2]
You linger on a feeling
That you can't quite put your finger on
Reminiscent of a summer in the Isle of Wight
But you think that it's too late
To back out at this stage
You need to emancipate
Step back and disengage

[Chorus]
Have you really thought this through?
Is he really the one for you?
Why are you so in love with–
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all
Why are you so in love with–
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all

[Verse 3]
I don't know if he'd stay or if he be on his pedalo
Cramping from the frantic pace
You told Alison next door
That all your dreams were made
But then your home screen flashed some more
He never was one for serenade
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Have you really thought this through?
Is he really the one, really the one?

[Outro]
Why are you so in love with–
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all
Why are you so in love with–
Why are you so in love with a notion?
It doesn't do you any good
It doesn't do you any good at all4Embed
