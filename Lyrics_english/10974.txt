All Time Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes you walk by the goods ones
'Cause you're trying too hard, too hard to see them
And sometimes you dont find the right lines
Cause you're trying, too hard, too hard to hear them

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you know what it feels like, 'cause you're like me
And you won't give up

[Chorus]
Till an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me
[Verse 2]
Some days you're too set in your ways
And you forget to shut up, shut up and listen
And some days you just have to misplace all your mistakes
Somewhere that you won't miss them

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So stop lying that you're fine, 'cause you're like me
And you can't give up

[Chorus]
Till an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me

[Bridge]
I dont believe that its a failure
I dont believe that its a fault
'Cause if everything were plain sailing
Oh, tell me what would there be left to exalt?

[Chorus]
But an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me
I want an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find meYou might also likeEmbed
