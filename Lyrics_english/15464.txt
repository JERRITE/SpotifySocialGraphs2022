Love is no age lyricspaso the night 
 From my window 
 Asking for time 
 That is tomorrow 
 To find it 
 At the entrance door 
 And before the bell 
 Hug him again 

 Love first 
 Love in secret 
 Because my father 
 I know I wouldn't understand 
 Under my pillow 
 I have all your letters 
 And a photograph 
 Where is next to me 

 Paying at it at all hours 
 Every day 
 And I listen to songs 
 That make me cry 
 My friends swore that I'm sad 
 And my mother just says: 
 Love has no age 

 The first kiss 
 I don't forget 
 It will be a memory 
 Forever 

 I die of grief and 
 I die of joy; 
 I live so confused 
 But, I am finally happy 

 I think about him ... You Might Also Likeembed
