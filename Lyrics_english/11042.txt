I Say i ’sti ccÿ - 2014 remaster lyricsi say i 'sto ccà 

 Me '' mbriaco and c'aggia do ' 

 Me turned to capable but I want to speak ' 

 I say i 'I'm ccà 

 'To sadness he leaves 

 'O wine it scenes but then it will end 
 I will move 

 Touching what I don't have 

 I will smile 

 Maybe crying a little 

 But I do from me 

 I 'me' mbriaco pe nun see ' 

 But I know I will be wrong 

 I feel in war the rest I don't know 

 I say i 'I'm ccà 

 It is fear of 

 And I am not a 'nterra nun me skeptà' 

 I Say i 'I'm ccà' 

 Every now and then you do it
