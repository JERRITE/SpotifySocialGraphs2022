Where are the Lyrics Gatas ["where the cats"]

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Where are the cats 'that do not speak and throw pa' a'Lante?
Where is the guilla'o corillo of Maleante?
Let's go for the album to make esconte
Now
Give him the crazy bar, who will pay you the drink
Look those cats who are looking at us
Vamo 'to throw lip pa' see if we win
Now
Where are the cats 'that do not speak and throw pa' a'Lante?
Where is the guilla'o corillo of Maleante?
Let's go for the album to make esconte
Now
Give him the crazy bar, who will pay you the drink
Look those cats who are looking at us
Vamo 'to throw lip pa' see if we win
Now
[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
How do you call yourself? And where are you from?
What are we going to do, Gyal?
If you have your boyfriend I don't care who
The one I like is you (aha)
How do you call yourself? And where are you from?
What are we going to do?
If you have her boyfriend, I don't care who, Gyal
The one I like is you

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Where are the cats 'that do not speak and throw pa' a'Lante?
Where is the guilla'o corillo of Maleante?
Let's go for the album to make esconte
Now
Give him the crazy bar, who will pay you the drink
Look those cats who are looking at us
Vamo 'to throw lip pa' see if we win

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam]
Aze it well that the fire turns on it, and I say it takes
Look at the way that touches her, and I say
I know you like my sandungueo, and I say it takes
Give more, take, give more, take
I see myself like a gargoyle, and I tell you
Feel my camping booth, and I say
He clashes, his body and yours clash, and I say
Give more, take, give more, take
