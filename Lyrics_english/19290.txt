When You’re Around Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm falling to the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around
When you're around
I'm falling on the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around

[Verse 1]
Elevate your mental, kick it on three
Mind set moves, what the fuck you gone need?
I know whatcha thought, would you be that?
I show nothing, I won't be back
Let me whisper something super secret in your ear
Let me tell you everything you ever wanna hear
Let me show you how to bow, this is static
Let mе take a bow for the ground from the attic
[Pre-Chorus]
What? You can't tеll me nothing
Standing on a roof while I contemplate jumping
What? You can see me coming
From a mile away, falling flat on my face

[Chorus]
I'm falling to the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around
When you're around
I'm falling on the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around
When you're around, don't try to change me
When you're around, don't try to change me

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, hate it or love it, this is me
I'm so sick and tired of trying to breathe
Freeze frame, pause, watch me turn it up a notch
Good luck, motherfucker, try and make me stop

[Pre-Chorus]
What? You can't tell me nothing
Standing on a roof while I contemplate jumping
What? You can see me coming
From a mile away, falling flat on my face
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm falling to the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around
When you're around
I'm falling on the ground from the ceiling
Feeling nothing seems to change when you're around2Embed
