Sodium Lyrics ["Sodium" letter]]

[Intro]
(This love knows salt)

[Verse 1]
Do not confuse me
In this game I am losing
You want to fool
Because that door is on par
If you explain to me, I understand you
If you shut up, I don't understand
I lost the bet and in the end
One less boyfriend, one more friend
[Pre-car]
I have you and I don't have you
Tired of the same story
You twenty -one have played well
But tonight, will you dance with whom?

[Chorus]
Salt, go out with me dance
If we like the same, oh boy
It is already night we are going to shine
Salt, this love knows salt
So much sodium knows me to hate
But I love you and that is obvious

[Post-car]
Ay, ay, ay, ay)
Ay ay ay)
Na, Na, Na, Na (Ay)
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na (Ay)

[Verse 2]
Huh, okay
At least let me play now
Without much delay, if you don't bother you
If not with you vamo 'to compete
For which it does make me feel
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
Well, I have you and I don't have you
Tired of the same story
You twenty -one have played well
But tonight, will you kiss who?

[Chorus]
Salt, go out with me dance
If we like the same, oh boy
It is already night we are going to shine
Salt, this love knows salt
So much sodium knows me to hate
But I love you and that is obvious

[Post-chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay)
Ah, ah, ah, ay (ay, ay)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, ay

[Bridge]
I have you and I don't have you
I already understood this story
But that closet closed well (ah, ah, ay)
And tonight, will you open it with who?
Oh
[Chorus]
Salt, go out with me to dance (ay, ay)
If we like the same, oh child (a-ah)
It is already night we are going to shine
Salt, this love knows salt (ay, ay)
So much sodium knows me to hate (ah)
But I love you and that is obvious, UH-UH

[Outro]
(Three, Two, One)
The truth, I did fall in love
This burns, I know why
I want to see you happy
Even with him2embed
