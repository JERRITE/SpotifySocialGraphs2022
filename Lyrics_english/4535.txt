Papal Bolla Freestyle Lyrics [text of "Papale freestyle bubble"]

[Intro]
Young Apulian
Listen 'ste fucking bars
Feel what the fuck of Pigna 'I'm beat
Bars, bars, bars, bars, bars

[Verse]
M part from scratch (uh)
Your bars Le Azzero (uh)
They study my Neuro text
Like "this does it really do?" (Aah)
Like your girl, babbbeo (hah)
That you believe you another Romeo (Hah)
The day before yesterday he made a Rodeo (Hah)
Do not you believe it? Look at it at Neon (hey)
I do this shit in a take (eh)
Yes, there are a bang of fake (eh)
Yes, someone writes you
No, however no, you are not Drake (ah)
Yes, you like you to females and males (seh)
Yes, go to the toilet with the taxi (Seh)
Yes, they all lick your ass
No, however no, you are not Justin (nah, nah)
I see more tragic scenarios of these, go to rest
Sognan all the magical years of each festival imploded
On the instrumental hooks, kicks, every technique, every metric
Rappo supercalifragyfi -pitralist (eh, eh, eh)
I want to make the reports with the tow (woo)
I want to do Gerry Scotti with wheat (Woo)
I want me to fill the backpack
I want to do Mary Poppins, Doraemon (Doraemon)
I was relaxed in costume and flip flops
I thought I was stored
But the hatred that lairs foils
It is like the bank account, in the sense that it has climbed me
The new flow of Pacca, yours knows already seen (Woo)
Fra ', ask me the feat that you eclisso (woo)
Ask me for the visa type the clearance
I am attaching a verse that is like an epistle, like an epistle (Emme)
Flow is a fucking papal bubble (ah)
I repeat it to you even if it is trivial (ah)
I repeat it papal papal
The new flow of Pacca, yours knows already seen (eh)
Try to copy me and see how much you are welfare
But be careful that you will look at the abyss
You're done every now and then, well, imagine fixed, between '
The walls tremble, between '
As if there was something to be teeming inside (woo)
The walls tremble, between '
Like a hooligan race
Like a Telluric shock (Fra ')
M above the verse (seh)
Like a pig and a sow (ah)
The Beat is purpose because it is my bride (Seh)
No, I don't know if you have beca 'is what (ah)
If you down in Puglia I say: "I'm done"
Up in Milan they say: "It's an ttofa" (hahaha)
Fu-Fu-Fumo above a sofa
'This shit makes you like the prozac, hey
Your usual sulfa is Loffia
Knows nothing, scrapping
People feel you and Ronfa (ah)
M takes to s need and triumph (ah)
Fra ', this herb is dry but is swollen (ah)
This free is dry but is swollen (ah)
You are mad but you don't have fabric
Take the cock in your hand, Jerk Offa (Emme)
[Outro]
Ahaha!
Take the cock in your hand, Jerk Offa!
Lirically you make beautiful blowjobs!
