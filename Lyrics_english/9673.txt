Ways To Go (live for Like A Version) LyricsThis is a rare, live, acoustic version of the band’s first single off of their Sophomore album, Spreading Rumors, recorded in Australia at the Triple J radio station studios.  The video opens with a brief exchange between the band members and the DJ

Pre-performance studio banter (between the band and the DJ)

Hannah Hooper:   “You know, today we were talking about ‘Ways
To Go’ being about a hangover.”
Radio DJ:  “Right? Yeah, yeah. So still getting back to 100
Percent?”
Chris Zucconi:  “Yeah, it's you know, maybе, you know, it's good to
Leave it undefinеd and let the listener come up
With their own interpretation.”
Radio DJ:    “And we will do that right now on ‘Like a Version.’ A
Live version for you of ‘Ways to Go’ by Grouplove
You're listening to triple J. Whenever you're ready
Guys.”
Verse 1 (Vocals performed exclusively by Chris Zucconi)

`	Zucconi:   I didn't ask for that. You give me heart attack
I didn't want to care, and then I saw you there
Been working like a dog. I turned all my dreams off
I didn’t know my name. I didn’t know my name

	Zucconi: I got a ways to go
	Hooper: I got a little bit longer

Hooper: I got a little bit longer
	Zucconi: I got a ways to go-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh (I got a ways to

Chorus 2 (Vocals performed by Hannah Hooper (70% mic) with Chris Zucconi (30% mic) providing faint backing harmony vocals)
	
Hooper:  Even when I can't see my rear view
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day
Even when I sleep all day
Even if I order like I'm times two
Living in the back of a bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day
