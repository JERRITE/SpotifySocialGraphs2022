I Still Ainâ€™t Over You LyricsOut of luck and out of tune
Half a day and night confused
Love may wash away the blues
But I still ain't over you

Damn the day that I forgot
Came so close and almost lost
It's been one year and fourteen months
And I still ain't over you

Hey, I'm the blood in your veins
I'm the cold when it rains
I'm your heart when it breaks
Time, no it ain't on our side
I'm the truth to your lie
And I'm your tear when you cry
Back and forth, and side to side
Right ain't wrong if wrong ain't right
Well I will love you day and night
'Cause I still ain't over you

Hey, I'm the blood in your veins
I'm the cold when it rains
I'm your heart when it breaks
Time, no it ain't on our side
I'm the truth to your lie
And I'm your tear when you cry

When the walls come crashing in
When the flames come closer then
Just remember time and again
I still ain't over you

Hey, I'm the blood in your veins
I'm the cold when it rains
I'm your heart when it breaks
Time, no it ain't on our side
I'm the truth to your lie
And I'm your tear when you cryYou might also likeEmbed
