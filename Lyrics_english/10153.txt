Me Before You Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's Tuesday night
No, I shouldn't be out this late, no, I'm not alright
Has it come to this?
I'm insecure
Lately I don't recognize myself, no, not at all
So uncomfortable

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I should just move on
If only I could just move on
[Chorus]
I miss the me before you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I miss the me before you (Ooh-ooh)
Who knew such a pretty face
Could bring me so much pain?
I miss the me before you
Before you

[Verse 2]
I don't get high
But I'm sat here smoking, thinking, goin' out my mind
I'm numb to ya
And I need to leave
Only lying 'cause it's easier than hurting me
I know what the truth is

[Pre-Chorus]
If only I could just move on

[Chorus]
I miss the me before you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I miss the me before you (Ooh-ooh)
Who knew such a pretty face
Could bring me so much pain?
I miss the me before you
Before you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Before you, before you
Before you (I miss the me before you)
Before you, before you
Before you (Me before you)
Who knew such a pretty face
Could bring me so much pain?
I miss the me before you

[Bridge]
Gotta get out, back on my feet
Back to the person I used to be
Yeah, you let me down, now let me go
Back to the person I used to know
I gotta get out, back on my feet (Back on my feet)
Back to the person I used to be (I used to be)
Yeah, you let me down, now let me go (Now let me go)
Back to the person I used to know

[Chorus]
I miss the me before you (I miss the me) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I miss the me before you (I miss the me before you) (Ooh-ooh)
Who knew such a pretty face
Could bring me so much pain? (Oh, you bring me, babe)
I miss the me before you
Before you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Bridge]
Gotta get out (Before you), back on my feet (Before you)
Back to the person I used to be (Before you) (I miss the me before you)
Yeah, you let me down (Before you), now let me go (Before you)
Back to the person I used to know (Before you) (Me before you)

[Outro]
Who knew such a pretty face (I gotta get out, back on my feet)
Could bring me so much pain? (Back to the person I used to be)
I miss the me before you (Yeah, you let me down, now let me go)
(Back to the person I used to know) Before youEmbed
