I didn't want smoking but gave the pen (yes)
A Barbie, but does not look for a Ken (no)
I always arrive when he says: "Come"
To behave badly dresses (good)

Turn off the notification 'in the cel
She has her own, but today she wants to fuck

I filled Be-So's neck '
I made time like a pre-so
If he sees it ', do not speak' of e-so, what

All single ones, they always look at her that she follows
