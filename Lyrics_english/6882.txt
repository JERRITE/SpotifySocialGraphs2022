â€‹you were my best friend Lyrics[Intro]
Anyway the peculiar thing is I, uh, it's really a request, a favor. Ah see I can't sleep Hubbel, and it would help me so much if, if you could uh well, if I had someone to talk to, you know, like a- like a best friend to talk about it with. Only you're my best friend

[Verse: Yung Van]
Call me back, I need you right now
On the ground as the rain pours down
Where'd you go as I needed you?
Where'd you go as I needed you?
Call me back as the rain pours down
On the ground I need you right now
Where'd you go as I needed you?
Where'd you go as I needed you?
I called you, but I can't speak
But I can hear you breathing
I'm wide awake cause I can't sleep
And I can only think of you
Yeah, I can only think of you
I can only think of you

[Verse: guardin]
Think too much, I'm so lost, where my head go?
Trippin' now, blankin' out to the echo
All I fear's finally here, movin' mad slow
Pacing now, trace your frown when I let go
Falling back into the depths of my own mind
I'd be lying to you baby if I said that I was fine
I've been rearranging furniture and finding stuff inside
Like the crystals in my pockets that you've probably left behind

[Outro: guardin]
I don't wanna be without you
Baby I am not okay without you
I don't wanna be without you
Baby I am not okay without youYou might also like3Embed
