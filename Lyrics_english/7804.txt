Leaving Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, maybe I should go way down south into Mexico
The way things are going around here, I think I probably should
I'm gonna fly away like the bird that hung around here yesterday
I'll be back someday when the weather's good

[Chorus]
This ain't no leaving song
You ain't done nothing wrong

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna sail my boat to where I don't need no winter coat
Build me a fire at night, sleep out on the beach
When I'm good and tired of that, I just might find my way back
Until that time comes, I'll be a little hard to reach
[Chorus]
This ain't no leaving song
You ain't done nothing wrong

[Bridge]
Hey, maybe I should go way down south into Mexico
The way things are going around here, I think I probably should

[Chorus]
This ain't no leaving song
You ain't done nothing wrong
This ain't no leaving song
You ain't done nothing wrong
This ain't no leaving songYou might also likeEmbed
