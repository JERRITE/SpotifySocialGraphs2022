Evidence [live] Lyrics when I say that I don't want to love you anymore
It's because I love you
When I say I don't want you more about you
It's because I love you

But I'm afraid of delivering my heart
And confess that I am excited
I can't imagine what will be of me
If I lost a day

I see my peace that emerges everywhere
That, later, I give you
I need to talk about the things I know
And then I refuse
And, the truth is that I am crazy for you
I am afraid of losing you, once
I need to accept that God, never
You will separate from my life

It is crazy
Saying that I don't love you
Avoid appearances
Hiding evidence
But why keep pretending
If I can't fool my heart

I know I love you
No more lies
If I die of desire
I love you more than everything
I need your kisses
You need my days
But without you I don't know what to do
What to do without you
I want you to know more about me

It is my fears that move me away
The truth is that I love you more than me
It is my fears that move me away
The truth is that I love you more than me
You Might Also like crazy
Saying that I don't love you
Avoid appearances
Hiding evidence
But why keep pretending
If I can't fool my heart

I know I love you
No more lies
If I die of desire
I love you more than everything
I need your kisses
You need my days
But without you I don't know what to do
What to do without you
I want you to know more about me

It is my fears that move me away
The truth is that I love you more than me
It is my fears that move me away
The truth is that I love you more than membed
