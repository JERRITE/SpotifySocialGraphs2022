The Click Lyrics[Verse 1: ZayBang]
Huh?
Nigga, I ain't never froze with a strap
Tell 'em we got hoes in the back, we got poles in the back
I just keep the pole on my lap
We could drop a load where you at, like, "Hello? Where you at?"
I done really slid for this shit
I can't really miss with the nick'
He done slid for the vision
Tell 'em you done slid for the bitchin'
Niggas yellin' gang, it's the clique, bitch nigga, this the clique
[Verse 2: Lil Bean]
I'm drivin' through, we doin' walk-ups, yeah
Speakin' on the gang'll get you chalked up
Upgradеd my lil' nine to a Glock, I had to boss up, yeah
But speak again, you tryna cross us
What happеned to that nigga? He was the man, I think he lost it
Why the fuck you playin' in that cat? You ain't gon' dog it
You can't buy a seat, I'm at a table with the bosses
I could pay a fee and put a nigga in a coffin

[Verse 3: KxNG LLAMA]
How you claim you gangster, but you shootin' with your eyes closed?
Boy, I got that drip, splash water like in Cabo
Run up on him, feed him six pieces like a combo
You would think these niggas lames too if you knew what I know
If I think we missed too many shots, we double back on 'em
Nigga think he too sick, fuck it, drop a stack on him
My dog got plays, like a wolf, he got the packs on him
My dog got plays, like a wolf, he got the packs on him, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I can't judge a book by its cover
And I know not to change on my brothers
If you fall with me, then I'ma fall harder
If you ball with me, then we gon' ball harder

Up in county, you get rolled up
Broke nigga, hold up
You know I got the game in my hand like a controller
Treat the rap game like my baby, need the stroller
Organized crime, bitch, we don't need a folder
Welcome to the 415 like Coca Cola
Strapped, ready for war, my heart a road soldier
If you ain't slidin' for your niggas, what that iron for?
Cut a punk bitch off pronto

[Verse 5: Lil Pete]
I got more money, more problems, more bitches
More motherfuckers hatin' on me, in my business
I done did shit, get caught, life sentence
I done came up from hittin' licks and hard livin'
When I got on, niggas was callin' me they cousins
Before EDD, we was runnin' up hundreds
Name one thing that I ain't start and I ain't finish
Rap nigga, but this rap nigga take missions

[Verse 6: Lil Yee]
Ayy, trap nigga, but I'm strapped, nigga, what the business?
And I been with the shit since we was children
Ask my granddaddy, he gon' tell you I'm the realest
And I done felt some pain that hit different
[Chorus: Lil Pete]
I can't judge a book by its cover
And I know not to change on my brothers
If you fall with me, then I'ma fall harder
If you ball with me, then we gon' ball harder
I can't judge a book by its cover
And I know not to change on my brothers
If you fall with me, then I'ma fall harder
If you ball with me, then we gon' ball harderEmbed
