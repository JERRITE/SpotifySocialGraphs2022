Boss Up Lyrics[Intro]
(Majestic keep stackin' them bands)
(Stackin' them bands)

[Verse 1: Molly Brazy]
I'm not lazy, I'm bossy, I don't feel like moving
In-in-in the fast lane but I proved it, I'm cruisin'
I-I hear niggas sayin' I don't write my own music, amusin'
I get on these beats and abuse 'em
My niggas doin' time, I could never make excuses
Thirty for a show, they don't owe no restitution
It's paid off, took a day off to get my head right
He on me like some headlights but I'm trying to see what that head like
Hair (Hair) laced, n-n-nails laced
Bitches sick, stale face
(White, white) White ice, (Red, red, red) red Wraith
Cut 'em off, why? They dead weight
Ever had to buy yo' neighbor house to stash money in?
Steppin' in some Loub's that I just brought with two-hundred tens
Bitches in my hood paying homage like I'm Lil Kim
(Old) Old niggas all on my line playin' remember when
[Chorus: Molly Brazy & Mozzy]
Nigga, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed up
Bitch, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed up (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Bosses in the building, I am one of them
HGM member, all the strippers be in love with them (Yeah)
I-I'm smellin' like a hundred M's with eighty on me
Twenty-four inch Forgiatos, throw the 'Cedes on 'em
Who hatin' on me? Ayy, tell them niggas run they chicken up
Chopper city wood, tell them niggas put them nickles up
We throwin' alley hoops to the youngin', that's how you big 'em up
The type of nigga let his dawg fall, should've picked em up (Ayy)
Everybody 'round this bitch eatin'
Buss down Rollie, compliment a nigga pieces
Ain't wait for them to feed me, went to get it, that's on Jesus
I really bleed this shit to motivate the demons

[Chorus: Molly Brazy]
Bitch, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed up
Bitch, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed up

Power plays, put the label in my own name
Built my own brand
Stacked it up and spent my own change
Power moves got me dancin' like this the soul train
Cali plug got me rollin' woods out of whole thang
Jazz on the plane, conversatin' with the pilot
Fuck the destination we wanna know, can we buy it?
Gettin' money better than therapy you should try it
O-o-open to the public but I really board private
White buffs, rock, call it Miss Mulatto's
Black amigos, we like tattoos and tacos
Feel-feelin' macho, big clips, big chops
For-for-for whoever want some, like I got a big pop
Used to go to school wit' you, you was never tough
Molly took the same route but she was never touched
'Member sittin' on the steps but I stepped it up
(We some) We some real bodybuilders come and flex with us

[Chorus: Molly Brazy]
Bitch, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed up
Bitch, would you, boss up?
Started off small, told myself it's time to boss up
Took a lil' minute, I ain't quit, I just bossed up
Pulled up in that, "Oh my fuckin' God", look who bossed upEmbed
