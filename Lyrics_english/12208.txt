Wasting My Time (Acoustic) LyricsWell, I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
Well, I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed up reasons for me to stay
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling and there's no reason
Just make the call and take it all again, woah again
Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red
Well, I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
Well, I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling and there's no reason
Just make the call and take it all
Well, I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my time again, woah again
I see you waiting, lonesome, lonely
I see you waiting, I see you waiting
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
Well, I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling and there's no reason
Just make the call and take it all
Well, I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
Well, I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling and there's no reason
Just make the call and take it all again, woah againYou might also likeEmbed
