Killer Bombón Lyrics [letter from "Killer Bombón"]

[Chorus: Lit Killah]
She has a chocolate
I brought it to me to try, I like a lot
At my table it moves it-Mueve-Mueve, Downtown
He has the 'Chinese' eye, it looks like Hong Kong (What?)
And I am the only one who has that chocolate
I brought it to me to try, I like a lot
At my table it moves it-Mueve-Mueve, Downtown
He has the 'Chinese' eye, it looks like Hong Kong (ah-ah; ah)
[Verse 1: Lit Killah & Rubén Deicas]
And I can't shut up if you're like that (if you're like that)
He puts my mind to fly in ecstasy (L-I-T; is that she has a chocolate)
Of To's those who had his favorite (Bombón)
He says that nobody becomes done as a liter (Bombón)
He leaves the bed and puts the Ripndip (Bombón)
It seems that my video clip was prepared (uh)

[Saying: lit killah]
With me he left for the paradise (UH)
He says that with him does not happen to him Na '(UH)
I put the chain and the off-white
I prepared myself

She has a chocolate (What?)
I brought it to me to try, I like a lot (What?)
At my table I might
He has the 'Chinese' eye, it looks like Hong Kong (What?)
And I am the only one who has that chocolate (woh-oh-oh)
I brought it to me to try, I like a lot
At my table it moves it-Mueve-Mueve, Downtown
He has the 'Chino' eye, it looks like Hong Kong
