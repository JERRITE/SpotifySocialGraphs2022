You Better Listen LyricsYou, take on me
And break apart the everything that makes me man
So I, want you to leave
If I ever want to restore my sanity

Baby look at me I'm the fool
I'd tear myself in two for the vision of me and you
Baby don't you know

Every time you come around girl
You've got me thinking
That I'm going to lose it
And every time I talk to you, you'd better listen
Because you need to choose between the things
That will lift you up and will break you down
Baby don't you know
Just listen to the words that I got to say
You want to do it your own and go about it your way
I don't suggest that you walk that path alone
You don't have the protection or the knowledge girl
To prevent you from the bad harm of the world
I want to say that you're more than
Welcome to leave with me

Baby don't you know your man's a fool
I'd tear myself in two for the vision of loving you

Every time you come around girl
You've got me thinking
That I'm going to lose it
And every time I talk to you, you'd better listen
Because you need to choose between the things
That will lift you up and will break you down
Baby don't you know

Stop, wait, slow down a minute
You're moving too fast baby
Stop, wait, slow down a minute, you're moving

You wanna, don't you wanna just slow it down
For the sake of your mercy girl
Don't you, don't you, don't you
No don't you wanna slow it down
You might also likeNow you know
Every time I talk to you you'd better listen
Because you need to choose between the things
That will lift you up and wither your soul
Girl you better know now, every time I talk to you
You'd better listen
Because you need to choose between the things
That will lift you up and wither your soul
Girl you better know now, every time I talk to you
You'd better listen
Girl you better choose what is right for you baby3Embed
