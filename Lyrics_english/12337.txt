Nothing for Me Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
How many times should I stop and believe in myself
I don't believe much in anything
I've seen enough of the pain and the shame and the blame
It don't amount up to anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I rewind back to a time
Where I would do anything and pay any price
And I need time 'cause I'm starting to think
That the promises ain't worth the sacrifice
[Chorus]
And there's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here

[Verse 2]
How many nights should I walk in my sleep
As I dream of how much I wanna run away
I've had enough of the stress and the mess
I can't take anymore, I gotta get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know why I'm empty inside
And I'm sure I've only got myself to blame
And I don't try to view the lies
It's just a waste of time, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
There's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here
(I gave you my life and it's fading away)
There's nothing for me here
(I gave you my life just to fade away)

[Bridge]
And I can't go on
And I can't explain
When everyone's gone and I'm left holding the blame
And I can't rewind
And there's no escape
It's been so long and I just don't feel the same
You might also like[Chorus]
There's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here
(I gave you my life and it's fading away)
There's nothing for me here
(I gave you my life just to fade away)
How many times should I stop and believe in myself
I don't believe much in anything

[Chorus]
There's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here
(I gave you my life just to fade away)1Embed
