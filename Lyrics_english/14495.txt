My bad (remix) lyrics [lyrics by "my bad (remix)" ft. Leslie Grace, Becky G
Lali Esposito & Karol G]

[Enter: Mau and Ricky]
Yes Yes
Yes Yes
Mau and Ricky

[Verse 1: Leslie Grace]
Who was going to think that with the same language
I would be touching bell at another door
Who was going to think that with my wallet
I would be buying bread in another store
It is not your matter what I do on the street
You like bad
[Choir: Mau and Ricky]
If you don't love me '
If you don't love me '
Let's make things clear
I don't look for love with you either, with you
If you don't love me '
If you don't love me '
Let's leave the pods clear
I don't look for love with you either, with you
My bad

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky]
I know you're not alone
Pa 'me, pa' me, pa 'me
And I'm not just
Pa 'ti, pa' ti, pa 'ti
But we have ourselves
There there there
There there there
There there there

[Verse 2: Lali]
Don't expect me that I don't know if I arrive
I get if I feel like
You and I make clear the game
You my bad and I your bad

There are a few days that I am crazy for you
I see you and I want everything you bring there
And then I don't want anything
Yes, I am like that, so
You can't stop it
Every morning you want more and more
You can't help me
I am your bad (your bad)

[Choir: Mau and Ricky, Karol G, Leslie Grace]
If you don't love me '
If you don't love me '
Let's make things clear (ay ay ay ay ay)
I don't look for love with you either, with you (Yeah)
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
Let's leave the pods clear
I don't look for love with you either, with you
My bad

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky, Karol G, Leslie Grace]
I know you're not alone
Pa 'me, pa' me, pa 'me
And I'm not just
Pa 'ti, pa' ti, pa 'ti
But we have ourselves
There there there
There, there, there (uoh)
There, there, there (uoh)
I know you're not alone
Pa 'me, pa' me, pa 'me
And I'm not just
Pa 'ti, pa' ti, pa 'ti
But we have ourselves
There there there
There there there
There there there
[Verse 4: Becky G]
Becky G
If jealousy and anger pollute
We bathe with soap and take away
There is no invention, no secret, or lie
That we both eat from another teaspoon
And then in the morning we are as if nothing
It is not your matter what I do on the street
You like bad

[Bridge: Karol G, Mau and Ricky, both]
You tell me that I am your bad
You stay looking at me alone and you don't talk to me
Because you like that at night
Be your body who speaks to me and whoever touches me
This is not love, or entertainment
It is like a thing that remains in the middle
When I want, you want
When you want to, I will
And if you, and if you

[Choir: Mau and Ricky + Becky G, Karol G]
If you don't love me '
If you don't love me '
Let's make things clear
I don't look for love with you either, with you
If you don't love me '
If you do not love me '(no no no)
Let's leave the pods clear
I don't look for love with you either, with you
My bad

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky + All, Lali]
I know you're not alone
Pa 'me, pa' me, pa 'me (I have you here)
And I'm not just
Pa 'ti, pa' ti, pa 'ti (in the palm of my tongue)
But we have ourselves
There there there
There, there (no, oh)
There there there
I know you're not alone (I know you're not alone)
Pa 'me, pa' me, pa 'me
And I'm not just (and I'm not alone)
Pa 'ti, pa' ti, pa 'ti
But we have ourselves
There there there
There, there, there (there)
There, there, there (there)

[Outro: Mau and Ricky, Leslie Grace, Lali, Becky G]
I Grace
I'm not just for you my love
But who does' Mami understand
Lali (Eat my mouth, bad, bad)
(Mau and Ricky; Eat your mouth, bad, bad)
With Karol G (Eat your mouth, bad, bad)
LG, BG, KG, Baby
