[Verse]
I dropped out of school, started selling dog food
Kept the biggest pistol even though I was a small dude
I'll get your block hot
50 Shots out this AK
You diss on my name, you get smoked on the same day
We do a hit, we hit your block the same way
You niggas broke, tell me how y'all wanna gang bang
Ridin' 'round with two baby ninas
I feel like Max Payne
Serving Caine, baby, I'm trapping
I'm selling everything
I gotta watch my back
I know these niggas out to get me
So I bought a mac
You better know i got it with me
Bag on ya head, on ya head
It's a meal ticket
Stuntin' on these niggas
They don't like it gotta deal with it
He pillow talked the bitch
You know she still let me hit it
Pistol to the party
Security let me in with it
I pop lock the Glock, bitch, I'm Huey
With this F&N
I cruise up the block while I'm listening to "Many Men"
If you a opp, we gon' put this hot shit on you
I got thirty shots, make me put this mop stick on you
Laser beam, nake you think chicken pox was on you
You get robbed, now we going in them pockets on you
He a plug but he snitching
He put sockets on you
I love fucking thick bitches
I fuck skinny bitches too
Love riding 26's, ride 24's too
Homicide would you take a life?
Would you really shoot?
You on some tough shit, We on some young shit
Let us through
100 niggas jump you
That's 200 feet stomping you
Treat a nigga like he Ricky, make me put this pump to you
Went from recording out the closet room
And using Fruity Loops
Me and Kid Wonder Bishop
Always had the juice
Let this TEC loose
All over your head like mousse
I got my Colt .45 catch you on some drunk shit
I collect checks from these hoes
On my Don Juan Shit
Got that check, fucked it off like it really wasn't shit
A lot of niggas run they mouth
They don't really run shit
You ain't did what I did
Bitch you never done shit
I'm smoking goat piss
That shit that have me high in one hit
You wanna rap beef, and tell fairy tales about me
Real street nigga, I got all the killers round me
Fake ass nigga, how could you be real around me
And if I'm hungry, bitch, you better not eat a meal around me
Hard shells hit your Soft Shells, now you ground beef
Flipping work, It do cartwheels when its round me
She can't swim
She gon' fuck around and drown 'round me
I'm the center niggas can't get a rebound round me
A lot of pussy niggas tryna' smile when I come around
But they smiles turn upside down when I'm not around
Cruising tough behind the tints
Loaded pistol in my reach
Better hustle like your broke
If you don't, you a leech
Put some muscle in your grind, down the line you'll see
I was young, always kept a beeper on the side of me
Leaving school every second, just to go and serve a P
I had good grades, 'cause I used to sell my teacher weed
Put the Dre Beats on, then I hit the studio
Spitting straight dope
I put fentanyl on the flow
Fuck her once then get ghost
Go AWOL on a ho
Heavy traffic, so I put some Berkeley bars on the door
.22 Glock loaded up with twenty-two shots
For this knot
Bitch, I scrapped up every angle in the pot
All these rap niggas actors
Always claiming shit they not
Picked my boogers
So my bankroll covered up with snot
She ain't love me, But She love me now
'Cause I'm getting guap
Since in getting funds
Hoes say zi'm acting funny now
All my niggas rob, boy, you better not pull your money out
Reached in and hat them thought I was gon' pull the bunny out
It's a hot car
Only drive it when its sunny out
They was laughing at me
I don't think they think its funny now
Black and yellow bumble bee
I parked it at my honey house
Bitch I'm from Chicago, I be all across the country now
Sleeping on a pallet when I lived in granny house
I had ambition and tuition to make it out
It was rough for me
Other rappers took the safer route
Being hardheaded really made me wanna listen now
Thinking 'bout the shit I could've had but I was missing out
Old heads lay some knowledge on you, if you hear it out
Say the game should be sold
But to me they give it out
Call my plug for the birds, he gon' bring the pigeons out
Used to have a girlfriend
I fuck plenty women now
I'm not a minute man
I won't give a ho a minute now
At my trap house, dope fiends running in and outYou might also like8Embed
