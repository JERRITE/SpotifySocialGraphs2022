You do not live like that Lyrics [lyrics of "You don't live like that"]

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny & Archangel]
I got used to the sour, no longer kicks (no)
They get home, do not fall
Only models, like Barea (JA)
Multiply Ciene 'is the task (cash, cash)
I am the chief in your own village
I am more than everything around you
Do not believe it '
Remember that curry puts her (wuh) until LeBron Gardea
Baja Pa 'La Cuesta (Low, Caprón)
That I am with the orchestra, bastard, not e 'the sect
I'm never down in the bet 'and Men' in this (Yeh)
Tell Vico that, of the final stretch, he was in the end of the line
The devil injects me, and I take out the one who sounds and lies them
Rra, Rra!
Another that falls by force of gravity
Rra, Rra!
Another one, in case it survives by chance
Refute my thesis
Bastard, and we are going to give you catequési '(catechésis)
I have not put a goal (put a goal)
And I have Christians praying 'Messi (Auh!)
[Choir: Archangel & Bad Bunny]
You Ronca ', bastard, and you don't live' like this (you don't live 'like that)
Your jeva is pending from me (pending of me)
Called me to give him and I say yes
I am a child since I was born (Wuh!; Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
You Ronca ', bastard, and you don't live' like this (you don't live 'like that, you don't live' like that)
Your jeva calls me and I say yes (I say yes, I say yes)
I do not change, I have always been like this
I'm still here, I'm still here (I'm a hijueputa since I was born), Auh!

[Verse 2: Archangel]
I went back to beat
But how did I come back? I don't understand, if I never left (Wuh, wuh)
Hardly the bug of mine, fuck 'with me and leaves' partio'
I have a couple of son ', a nephew', the one who doesn't tell me "dad", tells me "uncle" (wuh; ha)
Respect the 'rank', the position
I changed the fame for admiration
I never run out of ammunition
They want to border on, but they have no condition (condition)
I follow my life, I live bastard
Always active in my machine
I left the alley alone
And I bought a one million mommy mansion (Wuh; AH)
I have fat (fat)
I have the picket that moves the dough '(dough')
I am faithful to my label (auh)
That is why the world asks what happens
"Archangel sounds, ey-ey, for more 'that blocks it'"
"Archangel fills everything 'the concert' and we don't 'have it'" (Wuh)

Today Salimo 'at night with to' the boy 'put' pa 'the' insects' (prru)
This' Cabrone 'snatded me' and we owned the hardware store (cash, cash)
Andamo 'with to' Los Rosario 'without knowing the dust
They snore me, they snore, they snore, they snore me, and they are like meek million, without battery
I do not fail 'a hook (Yeh), today I put me, I hooked her (I hooked her)
Do not 'put' to your ranch and in the face we make you a wide hole (wide hollow)
What if I am a thug? Bastard, I don't know, what I know
It is that the nerve 'do not exist after do' Pecocet (no, no)
Today there is no excuse '; And if removed, used (if removed, used)
If my .40 were Versace, on the face I made you 'a jellyfish (BRU)
The night is confusing, and if with me it crosses you '
You bast
Marijuana, hookah and pill ', the Cuban who shines
Today he puts you 'in a chapel, although he walks' with the family eating in Padilla
Someone who does it like me is still born (no, no, no)
If you don't catch you in pr, they catch you domi in New York
