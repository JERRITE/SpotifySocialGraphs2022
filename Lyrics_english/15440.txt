I am not that woman lyrics [verse 1]
You have a false idea of ​​love
It was never a contract or imposition
And although I love you more and more
In a way that you can't even suspect

[Chorus 1]
I am not that woman
That does not leave the house and that puts the best of his soul at your feet
I will not become the echo of your voice, a corner
I am not that woman
[Verse 2]
Change your way of thinking about me
Or you will see how you will not find me here (you will find me here)
And although my heart breaks
I will force you to understand this lesson

[Chorus 2]
I am not that woman
That does not leave the house and that puts the best of his soul at your feet
I will not become the echo of your voice, a corner
I am not that woman
That lost girl, who signs a paper and gives you her life
You will never see me cry even if I feel wishes more than once
I am not that woman

[Bridge]
And although my heart breaks
I will force you to understand that lesson

[Chorus 3]
(I'm not that woman)
That does not leave the house and that puts the best of his soul at your feet
(I won't become) what you want, no; In what you prefer, no
That spoiled, pampered girl, lost
(I'm not that woman)
That girl who dances, dances to the sound of your life and your soul
(You will never see me cry)
You will never see me crying, no, no, no; You will never see me fall, no, no, no
You will never see me lost, crying, spoiled, oh, no

(I'm not that woman)
(He doesn't leave home and puts at your feet) the best of his soul
I will not become the echo of your voice, a corner
I am not that woman
That lost girl, who signs a paper and gives you her life
You will never see me cry even if I feel wishes more than once
I am not that woman
