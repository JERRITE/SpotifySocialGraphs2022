Be careful with the heart Lyrics ["care with heart"]

[Verse 1]
Cold lights of diamonds, angel or demon you
Caes from blue sky slowly just like a blues
No, don't cry like that

[Verse 2]
Almost irrespirable air, sunset streets
Half man with woman, skinny more than a pin
No, don't cry like that
[Chorus]
Be careful with the heart
Below in this material world
You defend you or will destroy you for anything
Be careful with the heart
With wings and with everything else
An oversight and can plum up, alert

[Verse 3]
Shines with gold reflexes; Tremble, tender cherub
I leave my gray bag and I walk next to you
No, don't cry like that

[Chorus]
Be careful with the heart
Below in this material world
You defend you or will destroy you for anything
Be careful with the heart
With wings and with everything else
An oversight and can plum up, alert

[Bridge]
Playing my skin
I take you to know
This dark city, ah
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Be careful with the heart
Below in this material world
You defend you or will destroy you for anything
Be careful with the heart
With wings and with everything else
An oversight and can destroy you
