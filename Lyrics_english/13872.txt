It’s Not My Fault Lyrics[Verse 1: Anthony Lewis]
It all started on a cool afternoon
I was sitting by myself when I noticed you
So I made my way across the room
Thinking what I gotta say to get you in the mood

[Chorus: Anthony Lewis]
It's not my fault that you're beautiful
Saying that It's not my fault that you're (smoking hot)
So an hour later when this feeling is mutual
I know we can (fly, fly, fly), fly, fly, fly
[Verse 2: Anthony Lewis]
The first thing I heard was your voice
I'm telling all my boys (about your smile)
Baby you don't know what you're doing to me
You're making my heart dream (oh baby, no)

[Chorus]
It's not my fault that you're beautiful
Saying that It's not my fault that you're (smoking hot)
So an hour later when this feeling is mutual
I know we can (fly, fly, fly), fly, fly, fly

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Girl you to beautiful for some dude to be talking terrible to you
I'm thinkin' me and you, dinner for two, tiramisu
As your desert, as we converse
I'm thinking digging in her skirt
Get her drunk first
Them other guys are bettin' you make your way to mine first
Them other bitches hate it, I don't buy 'em lunch first
[?] dicky bird blubblegum, maybe one purse, for the fun girls
And some lean and some loose ones for the young girls
Hol' up, hol' up, ay, It ain't my fault is it
That the ass so fat make me wanna dive in it
I gotta jackhammer, I'ma pile drive in it
Take a dap 'fore I stab, [?] high in it
You might also like[Chorus]
It's not my fault that you're beautiful
Saying that It's not my fault that you're (smoking hot)
So an hour later when this feeling is mutual
I know we can (fly, fly, fly), fly, fly, fly
It's not my fault that you're beautiful
Saying that It's not my fault that you're (smoking hot)
So an hour later when this feeling is mutual
I know we can (fly, fly, fly), fly, fly, fly
[Outro: Anthony Lewis]
