A lies more lyrics [letter of "one more lie"]

[Verse 1: yuri]
I know it was I who asked you
That we did not speak again
But I need you
I don't know well because and how it happened
But my conscience already
It turned from your team

Now that my heart wants to forget you
My head begins to justify you
And since you are an expert in deceiving me
Tell me something that has no going back
Maybe he will carry a little really
A lies perforate
To achieve, disrupt
[Chorus: Yuri & Natalia Jiménez]
Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me one more lie
Shoot just to the heart
I don't want
To keep hearing you
To live loving you

Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me one more lie
I can't bear it
My soul, a mortal lie
That I do not go to the opportunity
To forgive you again

Is that you swear to me
And I don't believe you, but you hint that you love me
And there I go, again
Always looking for good thing again (good)
And with little that I find you
I comfort myself

[Choir: Natalia Jiménez & Yuri]
Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me one more lie
That just to the heart
And I don't want to
To keep hearing you
To keep loving you
Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me one more lie
That my soul cannot endure it
A deadly lie
That I do not go to the opportunity
To forgive you again
To forgive you again
To forgiveyou might Also likembed
