Bottled Up Lyrics[Intro: Dinah Jane]
Dinah Jane

[Verse 1: Dinah Jane]
I don't need no diamond ring, baby, I got you
I can buy the finer things, simple things will do
Say the best things in life are free, now I know why
Since you gave your love to me, opened up my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah Jane]
I'm a bad chick, I need a bad one with me
Work from home, but he gon' stay up with me
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like
If you ride for me, I'm gonna ride for you
Back to back, boy, we gon' make it through
No sleep tonight, yeah, you know what I like (woo)
[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck
I'm drinking, baby, 'cause I'm bottled up
I'm smoking, baby, yeah, I'm high as fuck

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign with Dinah Jane, Dinah Jane]

Bottled up, yeah, yeah, bottled up, yeah
Feeling like Bee & Jay, we're drunk in love, yeah
I put 50 on your wrist, that don't mean shit
When you tell me that you're mine, I know you mean it
D'Uss√©, put it on the rocks
Little baby, on that french Vanilla Ciroc (Ooh, yeah)
We could be anywhere in the world right now
But you're here with me, girl (Oh, woah, woah)

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy, Ty Dolla $ign, Dinah Jane]

But he putting in the work
Let me feel if this is worth it
Gonna have to hit him with the bust down (Down)
