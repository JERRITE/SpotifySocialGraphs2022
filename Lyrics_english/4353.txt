You deny me (remix) lyrics [letter of "you deny me (remix)" ft. Jory Boy, Ñengo Flow]

[Bridge: Jory Boy]
Time was demonstrating
That we were sharing you
But you were expired
When I knew what you were talking about
The shit that you speak out there
You will have to eat it
Go and tell me I'm your friend
I know what will believe you
[Choir: Baby Rasta, Ñengo Flow]
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there

[Verse 1: Ñengo Flow, Baby Rasta]
ESPACHARRALA ÑENGO
Mommy not apparent
And not try
If your good knows that I leave you hot
You pass it by talking shit
You don't say that when you have me in your mami legs
If you want to deny me, give it do what you want
But it does not appear that you are serious
That bastard knew that you are not holy, that you are tremendous fierce
You don't talk about me
If you and I are guilty
I don't have time for your novels
Speak whatever you want and fuck
If at the end you always turn alone pal punish

I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there

[Verse 2: Jory Boy]
You tell him you don't call me
But you always look for me at dawn
The street always comes out and you define me
But how many lies you will hide
You tell him you don't call me
But you always look for me at dawn
The street always comes out and you define me
But how many lies you will hide

[Verse 3: gringo]
I have news for you
The photo you sent vo’a put on profile
What the world finds out
That last night you were with me
I will make you punishment, I'm coming back and I'm still
And for wuoh, oh, oh
That bicha picket, watches like you down
When the wuoh feels, oh, oh
From twelve to six o'clock
[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When we do it in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
