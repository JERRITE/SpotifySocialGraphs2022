Diablita Lyrics ["Diablita" ft letter. Anuel AA & Baby Rasta]

[Intro]
When you look at me like that
You show that you want to fuck with me, I know
(Real until death, did you hear, bastard?)
Trépeate on me
Do not waste time that then it's late

[Choir: Baby Rasta/Anuel AA]
You and me, the two fucking
Diablita, cling me on top
In your toto, I'm going to hide it
Drinking and smoking
Your man keeps calling you
And I have a glitter to answer
You and me, the two fucking (fucking)
That bastard calling (calling)
You, on top of me, jumping
I put you in four and I bite your buttocks
This bug is going to twist

[Verse 1: Noriel]
Baby, I have a glope
In case he keeps calling you
You are coming and here it will die
The bastard that gets lamb and touches you
Forget if you call
Make me with my Cuban
I have told you, you without this bug
You are like Dolce without Gabbana
You are a devil
And if I don't get it, it is devilish
He tells me to give him harder
And look me in the eye whenever he speaks to me
Baby always has a plan
Fucking in bed, he knows that I am the captain
Pasto comes from Amsterdam
The short and the rifles are lowered by a German contact
Wetting and moving on me
Shouting that I get inside you
And if your cat calls you
Tell you that you are busy
Pa 'chinggar, you have me
If you want to come
give me a call

You and me, the two fucking
Diablita, cling me on top
In your toto, I'm going to hide it
Drinking and smoking
Your man keeps calling you
And I have a glitter to answer

You and me, the two fucking (fucking)
That bastard calling (calling)
You, on top of me, jumping
I put you in four and I bite your buttocks
This bug is going to twist

[Verse 2: Anuel AA]
Enrolling and smoking
Fornicating and Perco, exploiting
You, shouting and touching you
And this bug, with that totito, cooling
He is your dusk
Forget about him, I'm your dawn
Do not let me fall
If you are hell, I am Lucifer
My bug is yours since I was in the crib
It's already six and 'we fuck from one
I kill that bastard if you ride a rostrum
Fucking, like you, none
Sucking, like you, none
They want to kill
You are going to be loyal or you are going to forget me (forget)
If one day 'toy prisoner
You are going to write to me or you are going to visit me (visit)
You like breastfeed
And like an animal, I'm going to devour you (devour)
Héctor Lavoe, snathea ', I spent 1300 in my Cazal glasses
[Outro]
(You and me, the two chining)
Look, tell me, baby
Look, tell me, Noriel
I vo'a shit in the Mother'l Devil
The untouchables, the Illuminatis, did you hear, baby?
(Drinking and smoking)
Hey, after us there is no one
We are gold, bastards
(You and me, the two chining)
Look, tell me, Santana
The devils, the wolves, did you hear, bastard?
Tell me, Sinfo and Onyx
The G4
(You, on top 'e mi, jumping)
Real until death, did you hear, bastard?
Baby Rasta
Tell me, Anuel
Tell me, Ganda4embed
