The last day Lyricsel last day we went, we returned, I remember well
Without catching our hand from the train
Without looking for the stupids to the jokes
Reproaching us to the gel cap
And love didn't have much more to do, I remember well
Of the tears of fire that I cried

And now I see it different
And now I see it different, different, weird, strange
Give everything for lost
Separate and not see yourself in years
Nor that it was an instinct
Different, weird, strange, silly and so many times cynical
What seems to be to play harm
And in the sun I lift my cup and the part that touches me
And that tar that does not go. The air passed passed
It is not the intention you put, or that it leaves or feels
With or without wood, whatever comes out of your mouth
It is such for which, your duty in my clothes
Your salt and break it now, enjoy the vision in all
You know what the stop is. You always rolling little
I keep rolling alone, your collision

And the last day we were friends but vice versa
We check how you can't use
With the torch of a traitor to set out Troy
Because Troy decided that he was not going to burn
And the rumor did not have much more to do, I remember well
And I learned that there are things that are better to lose

And now I see it different
And now I see it different, different, weird, strange
Give everything for lost
Separate and not see yourself in years
Nor that it was an instinct
Different, weird, strange, silly and so many times cynical
What seems to be to play harm

And if you take away the evils that are in lost background
That even knowing what you know there is no need to know who has been
So much looking for you in the bars I'm falling asleep
And now I see it different
You might also like now I see it different
Different, give everything for lost
Separate and not see yourself in years
Nor that it was an instinct
Different, weird, strange, silly and so many times cynical
What seems to be to play harm

Now I see it
And now I see it different
Different
I gave everything for lost
You left and I haven't seen you again in years
Nor that it was an instinct
Different, weird, strange, silly and so many times cynical
What seems to be to play harm
Now I see it
And now I see it different
