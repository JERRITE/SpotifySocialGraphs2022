100 Headaches Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't sleep alone
I'm scared of your ghost
Oh, I try
But I can't fill the void
Drown myself in poison
Oh, I try

[Pre-Chorus]
Every drink I taste, I associate with you
Every sip I take takes me back to me and you
[Chorus]
Now I get drunk just to remember us
Then I get drunk just to forget
I get hungover to hang onto us
A hundred headaches hurt me less

[Verse 2]
I can't talk to guys
I see you in their eyes
Oh, I try
But I still hear your voice
So I drown myself in poison
Oh, I try

[Pre-Chorus]
Every drink I taste, I associate with you (I associate)
Every sip I take takes me back to me and you

[Chorus]
Now I get drunk just to remember us
Then I get drunk just to forget
I get hungover to hang onto us
A hundred headaches hurt me less

[Post-Chorus]
A hundred headaches hurt me less
Than when you left
A hundred headaches hurt me less
Than when you left
You might also like[Bridge]
Every drink I taste, I associate with you
And it makes me sick that you're drinkin' with somebody new

[Chorus]
Now I get drunk just to remember us
Then I get drunk just to forget, oh
I get hungover to hang onto us
A hundred headaches hurt me less

[Post-Chorus]
A hundred headaches hurt me less (A hundred headaches)
Than when you left
A hundred headaches hurt me less (A hundred headaches)
Than when you left1Embed
