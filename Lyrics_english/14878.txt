I Stay Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey, I want to travel south this year
I won't... won't prevent safe passage here

[Chorus]
Why you act crazy?
Not an act, maybe
So close, a lady
Shifty eyes, shady

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hey, yeah, tears that soak a callous heart
[Chorus]
Why you act frightened?
I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me
So someday you'll see

[Bridge]
I stay away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Why you act crazy?
Not an act, maybe
So close, a lady
Shifty eyes, shady

[Bridge]
I stay away
I stay away
I stay away
I stay awayYou might also like15Embed
