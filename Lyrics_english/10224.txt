Love How It Hurts Lyrics[Verse 1]
I trust your heart, I trust in you
When times are hard, I reach for you
I'm out of breath, I'm frozen still
No light ahead

[Chorus]
We can rise up, you take me higher
My soul's on fire, I love how it hurts
We can rise up, you take me higher
My soul's on fire, I love how it hurts
[Drop]
Ignite with me
Ignite with me
Moonlight
Ignite with me
Ignite with me
Ignite with me

[Verse 2]
I'm unafraid, rely on you
When lights go out, I reach for you
I'm out of breath, I'm frozen still
No light ahead

[Chorus]
We can rise up, you take me higher
My soul's on fire, I love how it hurts
We can rise up, you take me higher
My soul's on fire, I love how it hurts

[Drop]
Ignite with me
Ignite with me
Moonlight
Ignite with me
Ignite with me
Ignite with me

[Outro]
Love how it hurts
