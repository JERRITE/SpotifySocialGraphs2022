Hot Mess Lyrics[Intro]
I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Walk into the room with my skirt tucked into my shoes (my shoes)
I skated here, I'm sweating, had a good day how about you (it was alright)
Let's talk about things, Dan, game plan
Hey Stan, why you talking over me? (ah)
Chatting shit, I'm not a kid, well this is patronizing
Then explain how you studied this at Uni so you'd know (mhm)
More than me about the thing that paid for my phone (yeah)
Why don't you make it a hat trick and comment on my look
Like "Bit outlandish, love, but you know, don't judge a book"
(Don't judge it)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't know who you think I am
But your bitch is not one
I'm good at what I do
And don't ever let anyone
Tell me that your song's okay
But sweetie did you know
A couple changes here and there would make it super cool
(It would be so awesome, like so much better)

[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, everyday

I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't you think she'd look a little bit nicer if she combed her hair every once in a while, aha
Look at those jeans, so messy, jeez
You know what, her natural hair colour would look so much better on her with her bone structure
She probably doesn't even write her own songs, hahahaha
Open up my mouth and rap some fiction poems prose
But all that you can focus on is my makeup and clothes
I don't have perfect skin, I don't live in fairytale land (La la la)
Stop telling me to grow some balls, I'm happy as a woman

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Also on that subject maybe you should change your look
Your presentation's scruffy and it's time you really took
This whole thing seriously, do you really want success?
Just cause I'm a girl I think that you think you know best
(Well let's be honest, I do)
[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, everyday

[Bridge]
I'm so stupid please tell me
How the world works, I'm female you see
Please stop using such big words
My brain can't take it
I'm just a little girly

[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, everyday

[Outro]
I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck3Embed
