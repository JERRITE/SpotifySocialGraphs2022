Just My Luck Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
I happen to get real drunk
One drink turned to shots and I lost count
I’ve been kind of down on my luck
Don’t know how my friends got me out this house

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I sound silly
Now I sound stupid
My sentences are broken and my words are getting fluid [?]
So if you’re listening now, just stop while you’re ahead
(Please)
Because I’ve made a fool of myself in the past five minutes
And now I’m yelling at the phone in the middle of a bar begging for your kisses

[Chorus]
It’s just my luck
I got your machine
It’s just my luck
You ain’t pick up [?] for me
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember this in the morning

It’s just my luck
I called you at three
It’s just my luck
That you went to sleep
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember this in the morning

[Verse 2]
So now I’m onto something sweet
There’s vodka in my purse, sex on the beach
I don’t know how I’m still standing on my feet
Plus I don’t look a thing like my fake ID

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I’m feeling silly
Now I'm feeling stupid
My sentences are slurring and my words get quite confusing
So if you are listening now, go on and stop while you’re ahead (ahead)

And now I’m yelling at the phone in the middle of the bar begging for your kisses

[Chorus]
It’s just my luck
I got your machine
It’s just my luck
You ain’t pick up [?] for me
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember this in the morning

It’s just my luck
I called you at three
It’s just my luck
That you went to sleep
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember you in the morning

[Whistling interlude]

[Chorus]
'Cause it’s just my luck
I got your machine
It’s just my luck
You ain’t pick up [?] for me
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember this in the morning (I won’t remember a single thing in the morning, baby)
It’s just my luck
I called you at three
It’s just my luck
That you went to sleep
It’s just my luck
I won’t remember this in the morning

(We could just let go, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, you and I
We could just let go, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, you and I)Embed
