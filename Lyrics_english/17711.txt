Daily Duppy, Pt. 1 Lyrics[Part I: Produced by Prod by MA]

[Intro]
(MA makes it deadly)
Glah, blap
(Scratch mixed it)
(In the streets)
Woo, Big Kweng, Daily Duppy
You see it? We're lit right now
(Trap House Mob)
(In the streets)
Yo, look
[Verse]
Look, this Barbie say I Street Fight too much
Now, she's out here callin' me Ken (Ayy, come 'ere)
Nah, I ain't Joey or Phoebe, Ross or Rachel
Nah, I ain't doin' up Friends (No)
With bro-bro in the the opp blocks, two sticks
Doin' up Twix, doin' up skengs
I know he's on hidin', If I can't find him, LOL
Then I'm undoin' his friends (Bap, bap)
I'm a smooth criminal, bad individual (Woo)
Might step 'round there, beat it like MJ (Wow)
Yo, we don't turn up the estate
Brown skin ting, she a ten on a dead day (Ayy, come 'ere)
Look, feds done came through the front door
So, it's the back way Kwengface escape
Huh, man still tryna shoot in your block
With a white boy, suttin' like Pressplay
Look, jump out of ride, man slap that
Clap that peng ting, screamin' out "Black gang"
Tap that, swear on my life, I can't breathe right now
But the flow's too mad, gotta rap that (Woo)
Man put a Luger Slug through your hat back
Hit me a lick, you ain't gettin' your racks back
OT trips, man's sendin' out young boys
Tell 'em "Be cautious", fast that, bag that (Uh-ha)
Yo, juice garn spill like wine
Dip, splash, spill like Tonic (Di-di-dip, di-di-dip)
Italian kicks, sporty drip, oh, yes, and the whip's Steptronic (Skrr, skrr)
I see man jump on the roads for a year and die
That ain't no logic (How?)
I'm smoking GB, chronic
Made man trip, spill, vomit
Packs came fat like CeeLo (Woo)
All my opps been pre-rolled
How many man have we left there missin'?
Left man swimmin' like Nemo (Di-di-dip, di-di-dip)
I done step 'round there with my Mafia 2
Had man fill it like Vito (Di-di-dip, di-di-dip)
Tryna turn this half brick to a fuckin' kilo
If I jump out the ride, and slap this, active
Corn have you doin' up backflips (Bap)
Why the fuck they actin'?
Do it on the 'net, in the flesh, they dashin' (Woo)
I just order a Uber, a Kapten
The driver's cool, lemme bark my zoot, I just try not to ash it
Man do-man do backflips, grands in elastic
I just try not to splash it
The opp block's dead like their friends
Kway back then, it was nothin' but crashings (Woo)
Free all my bros in the wing
They do their ting, it ain't nothin' but crashings (Bap, bap)
Tap-tap-tap it, tap it, slide 'round, doin' nothin' but tappings
Slide 'round, doin' nothin' butâ€”

[Verse]
**** got slapped with a beater (Ow)
I remember that day when I ris' that dots
And I ended up hittin' **** (Glah, glah)
I just charge 20K for a feature
I can't even lie, I just bought a new heater (New one)
Huh, Kwengface and skengface
Can't even lie, that's a mad little team up (Gang)
One Rambo, and a two tone nina (Gang)
Me and P like Durk and Von (Glah, bap)
Big-big grap, bap if I slap that at your hatchback
Then your hat back's gone (Woo)
Ayy-ayy, stay grippin' this wand
And this Insta' ting ain't wearin' no thong (Ayy, come 'ere)
Stay grippin' this wand
And this Insta' ting ain't wearin' no thong (Ayy, come 'ere)
Hit that once, one time, now, I'm off (Skrr)
Last year, I was steppin' on dirty, now, I'm just steppin' clean (True)
Put a rack in the T, mum's bare inner
Bare tryna find the receipts (Ouch)
Got the waps in the pouch, hid that in a car
Hope that they don't find a machine (Woo)
Live in the T, live in the beef
And I've been live in the scene (It's true)
Too many draw outs, sendin' me mad
Now, I roll with my hand gun everywhere (I've got it)
Bro says, "I'm losin' my mind"
'Cah I told him, "Uptown, downtown, anywhere"
If I di-di-dip, splash, leave man in a state
You're gonna need more than Medicare (Di-di-dip-dip-dip)
Brown skin ting, hood and boujee
I love how you slip down your baby hair (Ayy, come 'ere)
Back then, man, I couldn't buy clearance
Now, I'm in LV, doin' up clearin' (Woo)
See, it took me a while, now, they hearin'
Just had a lunch with my guy Ed Sheeran (My guy)
See, I'm in Thorpe Park with my toy
Just bakin' with Fosu, and Hudson-Odoi (My guy)
These blue lights makin' me noisy
Jakes at the light, man, I had to avoid (What's that?)
If I back this mash (Glah) and I slap it (Glah)
Finna make man levitate (Blap, blap)
This music help man elevate (Woo)
But this trap shit made man generate (Prr, prr)
Put a nine in a pot (Whip), yo, darg (Whip-whip)
Just let a man demonstrate (Whip-whip)
Just built me a opp, now, I meditate
Two in a Q, that's featherweight2Embed
