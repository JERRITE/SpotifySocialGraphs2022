SHE SAID HE SAID SHE SAID Lyrics[Intro]
(She said, he said, she said)
(She said, he said, she said)

[Verse 1]
I saw you in the back of the room
Takin' shots with your friends again
You talk shit, like you always do
I guess high school never ends
You sure got a lot to say
When you're talkin' on my name
You sure got a lot to say
But did you tell them everything?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and when you dance with the devil
The devil's gonna dance with you
Oh, and when you play with fire
The flame's gonna burn you, too

[Chorus]
Starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said
Just can't get ovеr
I let you go, yeah
Let's put this shit to bеd
She said, he said, she said

[Post-Chorus]
She said, he said, she said (Oh)
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said

[Verse 2]
Night ends and you call me again
Say you didn't mean what you said
But drunk talks are sober thoughts
So don't act so innocent
I can't keep playing games
When your rules are always changing, so
If you're saying, "Sorry"
You can save it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and when you dance with the devil
The devil's gonna dance with you
Oh, and when you play with fire
The flame's gonna burn you, too

[Chorus]
Starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said (She said)
Just can't get over (Just can't get over)
I let you go, yeah (I let you go, yeah)
Let's put this shit to bed
She said, he said, she said (She said)

[Post-Chorus]
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said (She said)
She said, he said, she said (She said)

[Break]
(Oh)
(Oh)
(She said, he said, she said)
[Bridge]
Burn your bridge, talk your shit
I've been growin' thicker skin
Forgiveness? Ask again
Patience only runs so thin

[Chorus]
Starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said (She said)
Just can't get over (Can't get over)
I let you go, yeah (Oh)
Let's put this shit to bed
She said, he said, she said2Embed
