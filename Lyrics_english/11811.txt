[Verse 1: j Balvin]
If the rhythm leads you to move your head
We have started as it is
My music does not discriminate against anyone
So let's break
All my people move
Look at the rhythm how you have them
I make music that entertains
The world loves us, loves us
He loves me
All my people move
Look at the rhythm how you have them
I make music that entertains
My music has them strong dancing
And it is danced like this
[Choir: Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Willy William]
Tamo 'breaking the disco
The party does not stop, it just begins
C'est comme-ci, c'est comme ça
Ma chèrie, la-la-la-la-la

Bottles up, yes
