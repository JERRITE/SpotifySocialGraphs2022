Glory, what have you done?
Ha

Hey chain on me, rash lava
Thousand thousand on BAG LV
Hundreds of bitches want me

Hey Bitch, We Got Some guns (PIF PAU)
Pow Pau, hit the carcass (ha, ugh)
I have two pillows on me (oh, yes)
Bitch, I hang like a young Pushkin (y)
Chains hang on dad (e)
Dig a cache with a shovel (e)
Rich, like a capper (e)
How is your salary?

[Bridge: Morgenshtern]
Hey, look
Two Multi on me - watches
Three on the neck, seven under the ass
I am a little more than twenty
Look, look
Two Multi on me - watches
Three on the neck, seven under the ass
I am a little more than twenty

Hey chain on me, rash lava
Thousand thousand on BAG LV
Hundreds of bitches want me
Hundreds of bitches want stones
How are you? How are you?
This is the new Cadillac
Make money, make money
Make money, fucking, like this

Sayonara "Sick" Boy
This is my house (I), this is my jon
This is my yard, the fucking Chill Zone (Oh, yes)
Young samurai with a transparent umbrella (Oh, yes)
Under pouring currency rain

Lukbuk's turn
Your girlfriend fingering
To my sports car at the club

Hey chain on me, rash lava
Thousand thousand on BAG LV
Hundreds of bitches want me
Hundreds of bitches want stones
