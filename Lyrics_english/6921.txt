[Verse 1: randy]
I hit the wall in twenty nail '
This crazy one always turns on the bows'
Safaera when I get scho
It makes me fresh your doña's friend (pum)
LOW PA'L soil and paint (bla-bla-bla-bla, what bitch)

Relax, vamo ', accommodate yourself
Come and Front me (there, there; come there, there), Yeah

[Choir: Lenny Tavárez, Justin Quiles & De la Ghetto]
Baby, what does that stop ', that you don't come out'
There, there, there, there, there?
And I want to hit me, ma ', you know' Where?
From there, there, there, there, there
Baby, what does that stop ', that you don't come out'
There, there, there, there, there?
And I want to hit me, ma ', you know' Where?
From there, there, from there, there (Remix)

Smokes, waist, hard (eh)
Cúme my life, foam champagne (huh)
Hit the couple 'is necessary

Uh, how rich get out with you
Baby, I had marijuana and turned her (Mari, Mari, Mari, Mari)

In twenty nail 'dale (pa' the wall)

[Verse 3: Lenny Tavárez]
A combi of buttock and tetita 'that is not bought in the mall
And I want to penetrate 360, John Wall
You see that after a chinggar you don't give a call
Just Gimme The Light and we set a Blunt
You have 'that corner will monopolize' (monopolize ')
Yomo says that ere 'a darke
I see it here
He has his hand in the knee, wow, what kind 'e wick, ah
Hypnotiza'o, I cost it
I wanted a perreo, the DJ put the count
One, do ', tre', four (haha)
Today I will do the same thing I did to the Chanteo
[Chorus: Justin Quiles]
Baby, what does that stop ', that you don't come out'
There, there, there, there, there?
And I want to hit me, ma ', you know' Where?
From there, there, from there, there

[Verse 4: brray]
Po-po-ponle, never down 'never
I am that perreo will grab 'by the neck
And it's not your mai's fault if life does not educate you
You have 'La Tuqui, that's why E' so daughter 'and whore
And what is what you have there, mommy?
I wonder, since I saw you 'you have made for me
Pa 'give it to you and follow him in repeat
Drinking Tequi, crazy for hitting my Guayaquil
My mind in that ass, my body in Beijing
So I vo'a hit (Yeah)
I already gave my place, you will make you put in your place
Anyway, I'm going to get to me and so I will leave you
You walk and I don't want to tie you (BR, BRR, Sheesh)

[Verse 5: Justin Quiles]
Give it heat, she wants heat
Gatita asks for heat and fidy 'steamed
Without grief, she knows that she is good
A pepa pa'l system and goes out with the bargain of the problem
Alert, if you get loose
I'm going to touch you much richer than an orchestra
Give it heat, that she wants heat
Gatita asks heat and you will do the favor
