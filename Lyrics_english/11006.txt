Friday (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Big Freedia]
It's Rebecca Black
Dorian Electra
3OH!3
And Big Freedia
It's the fucking weekend, people
It's Friday

[Verse 1: Rebecca Black]
7 AM, waking up in the morning
Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs
Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal
Seein' everything, the time is goin'
Tickin' on and on, everybody's rushin'
Gotta get down to the bus stop
Gotta catch my bus, I see my friends
[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black]
Kickin' in the front seat
Sittin' in the back seat
Gotta make my mind up
Which seat can I take?

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
It's Friday, Friday
Gotta get down on Friday
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend
Friday, Friday
Gettin' down on Friday
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend
