[Saying: Rauw Alejandro]
'Toy put pa' take a bastard note
Exploit the account and get a culona
Wake up in another bed other than mine
I care about a bug my ex, if it is tremendous because he would, haha
But what fuck happens to this bastard? (Yah!)
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Lyanno]
Today I want to take a loquera, take a loquera
Guayar for the disc, guayar for the disc (tra, tra, tra, h)
Guayar, Guayar

You are Chucky
Linda face, a vece e 'Media Puti
Your cat left you alone on the album (what?)
Bastard, what a rookie
Put on four, Menea Las Nalga '
The gistro is seen under the skirt
In taking it out, it does not take long
Always sweet, you never know bitter
I threw the boyfriend, prefer to be single
That phillie never stays outside
Always with the condone 'in the portfolio
Of the daughter 'e bucky, it was the first, Yeah-Yeah (Ra-Rauw)

[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro & Rosalía]
Today I escape
And I invented a plan like El Chapo
She wants to tie up to a caco
From Carolina, a born Bellaco
I, who fails, doubtful (Yah!)
Tonight I'm dangerous
She is not my wife, but the husband
He saw it and said: "Oh, what venous", oh (wow, baby)
