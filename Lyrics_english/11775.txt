Day after day lyrics [letter from "day after day"]

[Verse 1]
A flower lasts a summer
A summer is three months
Twelve months is one year
Can be so short
How is the dictionary brief
To define who you are

[Verse 2]
I love you is not I love you
I love you is not so strong
If you are not strong what you feel
If you feel that you have loved
With the body and with the mind
How I love you
[Pre-car]
Going into the world is like walking in the middle of a war
But by your side everything is safer because I find peace
I ask the sky
That protects you

[Chorus]
That we are always the same, that you love me the same
I want to be with you the rest of my life
That we can be together until the end
Be able to wake up with your smile
It is my joy
Day after day

[Verse 3]
There is no pain that is eternal
A until later is eternal
See you later a return
There is no return without encounter
And an encounter is the most beautiful
When we are melee

[Pre-car]
Going into the world is like walking in the middle of a war
But by your side everything is safer because I find peace
I ask the sky
That protects you
You Might Also Like [Choir]
That we are always the same, that you love me the same
I want to be with you the rest of my life
That we can be together until the end
Be able to wake up with your smile
It is my joy
Day after day

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
That we are always the same, that you love me the same
I want to be with you the rest of my life
That we can be together until the end
Be able to wake up with your smile
It is my joy
Day after dayembed
