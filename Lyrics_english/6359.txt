Heat of the Summer Lyrics[Intro]
(Listen now fâ€”)

[Verse 1]
No one can take me out of this mess
I do it to myself
I lost my phone, my keys, what else?
The acid doesn't help
I'm paranoid as hell and I wanna
Go home but there's no place to run
[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!

[Verse 2]
I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubts and I'd rather
Stay home 'cause there's no place to run

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
You might also like[Bridge]
I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer1Embed
