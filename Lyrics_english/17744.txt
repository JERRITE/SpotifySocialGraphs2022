Kane & Undertaker Lyrics[Intro: LD & Rv]
That way
R4DIANT made this one
Still stretchin' shit, one-forty-four, OS
Mason
Mh-hmm
OS, OF, Originals, Official (All of that, all of that, all of that)
Don't get got
When my head gets hot, might get yourself shot (Yo)

[Verse 1: Rv]
I ain't tryna clean up when I'm bringin' the mop (Nah)
I'm spinnin' the block (Spin it)
Won't find them chillin' at Tops
Too much man got did in that spot (Too many)
Nowadays, you get life for an AM
Even more reason to finish the job (Trust me)
No phones on the glide
Make them make calls so I'm ringin' it off (Baow)
Been out there since school days
Shoulda been black Air Ones, not kickers (True)
Went home with blood on my shank
No gold stars, didn't earn no stickers (None)
I'm in the field, I'm good with my feet, but I'm not the fittеst
Run man down, tryna put him to sleep
Woulda beat me, but bro was the quickеst (Come here)
[Verse 2: LD]
Little bro stepped in with the ZK blade, same size as my dreads (Ayy, y'mean?), length (Mh-hmm)
I've got arms and I'll show a man strength (Ayy)
Man's ultra attack with the nine in the 4-4-2, fuck playin' defence (Mh-hmm)
Bro stepped in with the mop and he spilled some juice
It's mad I weren't makin' the mess, fuck it
Jump out gang, man's with it, let that grrt then bill it (Grr)
Four man down one day, it was me and gang that did it (Yeah, all of that, all of that, all of that)
I'm like, "Come on, man! You know the vibes"
Caught him again so we did him up twice (You know)
It's been ten years straight
Now the feds got me screamin' out, "Free all the guys" (Mh-hmm)
You see nuttin' ain't nice (Ayy)

[Verse 3: RV]
I was on G wing washin' my beddin' (Stress)
That's green sheets and a blue mattress
Blade in my hand like Wolverine
Shoulda been me instead of Hugh Jackman (Me)
We don't talk much, we just do action
Opps get rubbed out when the crew catch them (Dead)
My man came out of jail
Now he's in Hell, gotta do a new caption

[Verse 4: LD]
I was on C wing givin' out orders (Icin')
See a man's flesh get spread like Flora (Mh-hmm)
I was like Fat Ron in my prime (Haha)
Put me up front, prominent scorer (Baow)
'016, got spent in the sauna (You know)
He got saw on that corner
Shot on that corner, dropped on that corner (Stretched)
And we're still outside on that corner (That way)
You might also like[Verse 5: RV]
If you see me on Lordship Lane (What?), you know where I'm headin'
Me and my blade at the weddin'
I had it on stage, performin' at Reading (Facts)
My man said he wants beef
Cool, took out my shank and fed him (Ching)
Had the dot-dots under my mattress
Pray that my mum didn't change my beddin'

[Verse 6: LD]
See, I'm not just rappin' (Uh-ha)
I'm on Five Ways, who we attackin'? (Who?)
I'll sponsor all of that shit
Made the young boys fire up, one in the clip (All of that, all of that, baow)

[Verse 7: RV & LD]
Mask on like Kane, never burned my face
Stop talk and chat, man, it hurts my brain (Dickheads)
Suttin' turned pack in the Woods
And two turned pack different, Turnpike Lane (Ayy, mh-hmm)

[Verse 8: LD]
Long hair, long jacket
I'm feelin' like The Undertaker (Ayy)
Real gravedigger, big risk taker
Make man meet the Creator (Stretch that)
I was in school sittin' exams with Luger and nines in my blazer (Live boy)
Godfather, I just throw man racks and they turn man flavours (All of that, all of that)
[Verse 9: RV]
All of that work that I did in my days
Can't drive past opps, gotta fling on the brakes (Skrrt)
Since '09, I was flickin' my blade (Blade)
Now I've copped new boots that's bigger than Ye's (Ours bigger again)
They don't want pepper, them man are baby spice, Emma Bunton
Told the young G's, "Rise up the guns dem"
If I don't go on them glides, I'll fund 'em

[Outro]
Mason
Some live boys in the buildin', you know, mh-hmm
R4DIANT made this one
Stretch that on peak, haha1Embed
