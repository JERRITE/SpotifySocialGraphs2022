Everybody Loves You When Youâ€™re Dead LyricsThey crucify you when you get it wrong
When things are fine they put you ahead
They laugh at you with your trousers down
They pick the stones and aim them at your head
When you're alive they won't care what you said
What you deserve and all the blood you bled

It doesn't matter what you try to hide
The sun comes out and then the truth is read
Your fans'll love you when you're alive
But the wreaths are laid by the rest instead
When you're alive they won't care what you said
What you deserve and all the blood you bled
'Cos everybody loves you when you're dead
Kneel and pray by the side of your bed
And everybody loves you when you're dead
Kneel and pray just like your momma said

When you're alive they won't care what you said
What you deserve and all the blood you bled
You'll turn in your grave at what's gonna be said
You'll finally be appreciated
'Cos everybody loves you when you're dead
'Cos everybody loves you when you're deadYou might also likeEmbed
