I Shouldâ€™ve Told You LyricsI was just a ?? from what I had to say
Something grabbed a hold of me
It's like I realized that day
That I should be ashamed
Of what I let grow much too deep

[Chorus1]
But you took control of me
Your love it was too sweet
You had a hold on me
That just couldn't be released
You touched a soul in me
You could grow old with me
Wanna give all of me
But we can no longer be
[Chorus2]
I never got a chance to say
How much I loved you
How much I needed you
How much I truly adored you
(Baby) I should have told you
My feelings were for you
And I didn't want you to go astray

Thought my love for her had changed
Arguments put out the flames
Guess I needed time away
But I never thought that I found you
Someone so equal to my vision of my soul mate

[Chorus1]
[Chorus2]

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Never had a chance to say
How much I loved you
How much I needed you
I truly adored you

[Chorus2]
