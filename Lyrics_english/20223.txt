​would it matter pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
Thank you, sadface
5-5-5-5-5head

[Chorus]
Messing with my life I been playing with the fire
You say that you care, but you don't you're just a liar
Fuck a cheat-code, break the game just like a hacker
I would tell you how I feel, but would it even matter? (Would it even matter?)
I don't know, I don't know
I don't really think it would, think it would
I keep it to myself, to myself
Because I know I should, know I should (Know I should)
[Verse 1]
Broken angel wings, I been rushing to the grave
Nobody ever show you love until you make a name
I'm so sick of being nice when no ones nice to me
And I'm so sick of everybody always doubting me
Things don't ever feel the same like it used to
Cut connection off something like it's Bluetooth
Offline like I got hit with a DDoS (Thank you, sadface)
Too drunk at my show and I'm next on

[Verse 2]
I need you by my side
To tell me that I'ma be fine
I'm such a mess, staying up every night
Nobody knows what I lock deep inside
I know I can do this I just need some time
It's evident, they say I'm heaven sent
Work on my art I can't focus on negatives
I'm over all of this isn't it obvious?
I don’t want your love if it's just empty promises
Live a life that's full of sin and self destruction
So high I can barely even function
Going up I'm blasting off just like a missile
I might die before I reach my full potential
Feeling down and so I go and light the sticky up
Running laps inside my head it's like it never stop
Never had it now I do and now they want a taste (Thank you, sadface)
Burning memories with a blunt until they're all erased
Let's be honest you're not special and we're all the same
Making music is the only thing that helps the pain
Never had it now I do and now they want a taste
Burning memories with a blunt until they're all erased
You might also like[Chorus]
Messing with my life I been playing with the fire
You say that you care, but you don't you're just a liar
Fuck a cheat-code, break the game just like a hacker
I would tell you how I feel, but would it even matter? (Would it even matter?)
I don't know, I don't know
I don't really think it would, think it would
I keep it to myself, to myself
Because I know I should, know I should (Know I should)Embed
