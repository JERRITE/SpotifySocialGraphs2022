My nightmare Lyrics [lyrics by "my nightmare"]

[Intro]
A while ago
I didn't think about you

[Chorus]
My nightmare, you, the worst
You are in all my dreams and I do not escape
From my life, you the worst
I have to throw or save a while
My nightmare, you, the worst
You are in all my dreams and I do not escape
From my life, you the worst
I have to throw or save a while
[Verse]
I have to kill you, get out of here
I am Goa, everything painted me gray
You serve for evil, equal to me
Tequila, some friends, I go out for Madrid
I am like a perfect hell
That there is no turning back is true
You move the weather back
And it doesn't matter, I enjoy the moment
Hell is perfect, a long time ago ...
Hell is perfect, I didn't think about you

[Instrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
My nightmare, you, the worst
You are in all my dreams and I do not escape
From my life, you the worst
I have to throw or save a while
I have to kill you, get out of here
I am Goa, all of Gray is painted
You serve for evil, equal to me
Tequila, some friends, I go out for Madrid

[Outro]
My nightmare, you, the worst
My nightmare, you, the worst
From my life, you the worst
I have to throw or save a might might also like1embed
