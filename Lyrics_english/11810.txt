It is no reason to not think about what will happen,
When the day comes the one who has to lose,
Lose my loneliness knowing that you are,
I understand that tomorrow nothing will be the same.

It is no reason to hate, (hate you once again)
It's no reason to see, (my smile breaks)
It's no reason to see, (my friends get away)
It is no reason to give you, (my life and more)

And lose my loneliness and feel like today,
Feel free without looking for a reason,
I grab my guitar and start singing,
There is no reason to cry.
It is no reason to hate, (hate you once again)
It's no reason to see, (my smile breaks)
It's no reason to see, (my friends get away)
It is no reason to give you, (my life and more)

I am ceasing to be, if I was what I was yesterday,
I took the table and I was going to skate,
I laughed out, to think that it was going to be,
Macabeo just like my friend Andr√©s

It is no reason to hate, (hate you once again)
It's no reason to see, (my smile breaks)
It's no reason to see, (my friends get away)
It is no reason to write, this fucking song! Embed
