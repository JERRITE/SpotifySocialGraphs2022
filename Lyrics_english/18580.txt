Wherever You Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
The kind you like
To come back in
Wherever you go

[Verse 2]
No hawk in sight
The scenic drive
The signs just so

[Verse 3]
The brightened lines
Stay by your side
Wherever you go
[Pre-Chorus]
The kind you like
A comeback kid
They told you so

[Chorus]
Wherever you go
No doubt it
It’s true
The lights off

Wherever you go
No doubt it
It’s true

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
The kind you like
No end in sight
The rest you knowYou might also likeEmbed
