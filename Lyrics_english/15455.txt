Sand and sun lyricsel flavor of the wind and your dawn
Break the distance constantly
I can feel every day
That memory makes me live

Because part of so many things
That they still feel
Always so present
Always so present

Sand and sun
I take you inside my heart
You will be with me always where I'm going
You are part of my life and what I am
Sand and sun
If they invite me, I dance

You are like the air that is not seen
I breathe strongly and deeply
I take you inside me
You give me strength to continue

It is for you that I feel the heart
Of all my people
Always so present
Always so present

Sand and sun
I take you inside my heart
You will be with me always where I'm going
You are part of my life and what I am
Sand and sun

If they invite me, I dance

Always so present, dancing
Tequila and Ron
Arrive and invite another round
The rumba goes to the moon
And it comes for the stars
Anah√≠ with people in zone
Latin America
You Might Also Likearena and Sol
I take you inside my heart
You will be with me always where I'm going
You are part of my life and what I am
Sand and sun

Sand and sun
I take you inside my heart
You will be with me always where I'm going
You are part of my life and what I am
Sand and sun

If they invite me, Dance Yoembed
