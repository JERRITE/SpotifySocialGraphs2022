[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
WOH-OH (YEAH)
WOH-OH, OH-OH (Myke Towers)
Mmm-mmm (yatra, yatra)

[Pre-Caro: Sebastián Yatra]
How crazy it would be
If I were the owner of your heart for just one day
If joy beats us, I would finally kiss you
What would happen?
You could see between him and I would win
[Chorus: Myke Towers & Sebastián Yatra]
My condition: madly in love with a girl that strangers today
And not having you hurts me
Seriamo 'the couple of the year
How I miss you
Without condition I fell in love precisely from a girl who is not mine
And my friends knew
And everyone told me what would happen, you would leave me

[Verse 1: Myke Towers]
If they gave me only twenty -four hour ', I take it
I swear that I'm going to do something 'that have never done you
I already tired of being a friend 'right'
I do not see you, but you don't even say it
If not 'Juntamo' seriamo 'the couple of the century
With her Acapella gives me introducing it
Double edge knife
Cortamo 'and the' video 'gave me reproducing it'
They told me, I ignored them
Everything simply now remained in nothingness
He did it and at the eye 'he looked at her
I never believed that love blinded

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Myke Towers]
My condition: madly in love with a girl that strangers today
And not having you hurts me
Seriamo 'the couple of the year
How I miss you
Without condition I fell in love precisely from a girl who is not mine
And my friends knew
And everyone told me what would happen, you would leave me

That minidress from seeing a photo of yours
And seeing you on television may be that my mind destroys me
Stop, as the song says
That they do not imprison anyone for stealing a heart
Suffering, crying with sorrow
That I do not see my crying is not worth it
I don't have wings, but you do fly
You become the bad of our novel
You have me suffering, crying with sorrow
That I do not see my crying is not worth it
I don't have wings, but you do fly
You take away the track and I stay up

[Choir: Myke Towers & Sebastián Yatra, both]
My condition: madly in love with a girl that strangers today
And not having you hurts me
Seriamo 'the couple of the year
How I miss you
Without condition I fell in love precisely from a girl who is not mine
And my friends knew
And everyone told me what would happen, you would leave me

[Outro: Sebastián Yatra & Myke Towers]
I had another melody
Of what would result
Damn monotony
Was it your fault or was my fault? (Seriamo 'the couple of the year)
I learned to live with jealousy (with jealousy)
You learned not to be mine (no, oh)
It only remains to be sincere
I still love you8embed
