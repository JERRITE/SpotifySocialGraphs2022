Letter To Ur Ex Lyrics[Verse]
Last night, you sent a text to him
Made us have a fight, made a mess of it
I know you're his ex, but you can't do that anymore
Close the door for me
And you don't owe nothing to me
You think you know all about me, huh?
You've never been me, but I've been you, girl
I've had my heart broken, too, girl
Many times before, yeah
I've done it all, I've seen it all through
I didn't eat, I didn't sleep, too
Oh, my God, all my memories
Waitin' for the right caller ID
So, yeah, I get it
That don't mean I'm gonna always be forgivin'
There comes a timе when you gotta let my love start
And I can only do that whеn you stop
[Chorus]
With the drama, drama, drama, drama
I don't wanna sound like a bitch, no, I don't wanna
If you carry on like this, you gon' get your karma
Take it from a girl who's already been through the trauma
Please stop with the textin', callin', showin' up
I think you know what you’re doin' and it ain't showin' love
Stop now, baby, it's drivin' me crazy, please
You ain't got no drama with me, no

[Outro]
Drama, drama, drama, drama
If you carry on like this, you gon' get your karma
Please stop with the textin', callin', showin' up
I think you know what you’re doin' and it ain't showin' love
Stop now, baby, it's drivin' me crazy, please
You ain't got no drama with meYou might also likeEmbed
