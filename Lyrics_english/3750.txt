Let’s Push It LyricsHuh, huh, whoa……

I need a hand, not your basic sympathy
We have a plan to make into reality
We can ____ long ago can be forgotten
We've gotta be the one to share in ecstasy
No matter what, things can change within a time
Don't fall behind, let's see who comes first in line
You gotta know that I'm gonna be there

Yeah…
Don't rush it, no no
If you need it, we can achieve
Let's push it
And it can be all yours
If you need it, we can achieve
Let's push it
And it can be all yours
All yours, hey…

Create the mood; mind will work well over you
We've got the moon, don't care for stock reality
Enjoy our time, patience not our stronger virtue
Let's make it right and hold on to the mystery
You gotta know that I'm gonna be there

Whoo…
Don't rush it, no no
If you need it, we can achieve
So let's push it
And it can be all yours
If you need it, we can achieve
So let's push it
And it can be all yours

Whoa… hey, hey…

Yours……

You…. Can have it
Let's push it
And it can be all your, all yours
