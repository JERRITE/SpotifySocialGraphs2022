TranslationsEnglishFind Someone Like You Lyrics[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Somethin' 'bout the way that you talk to me
Even when you not around, I feel you boy
I feel you boy, yeah
Tangled in your love and your energy
Perhaps it was the way that you smiled
I see you boy, oh, I need you boy, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I've been waitin' my whole life to find someone like you
Find someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been waitin' my whole life to find someone like you
Find someone like you
Baby I, I want this
I want this to last forever
Baby I, I want this
Can we make this last forever?
[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
Nothing's ever perfect, but you're perfect to me (Uh-huh)
And fuck bein' asleep, you're a dream, I need you
Though we got a past, I want you (Yeah)
And even when it's bad, I love you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I've been waitin' my whole life to find someone like you
Find someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been waitin' my whole life to find someone like you
Find someone like you (Oh, baby, can we make it last, yeah?)
Baby I, I want this (Oh I, I)
I want this to last forever (We can make it last)
Oh yeah, yeah
Baby I, I want this
Can we make this last forever? (Can we, can we make it last, yeah?)
Oh yeah, yeah
