Too Many Chiefs... Not Enough Indians LyricsIn the sun he hides away
Cause they smile and tell him lies
But the boy he always knew
That they'd choke upon his pride
As the greed eats the sand
Turns to stone all that lives
All he builds is made by hand
And the love he always gives
Oh when they look in to his eyes
Why can't they let him be
And he knows they're not that blind
They just choose not to see
All he knows is in his heart
So he never speaks his mind
Say his prayers and tries so hard
And the lord says give it time
Oh when they look in to his eyes
Why can't they let him be
And he knows they're not that blind
They just choose not to seeYou might also likeEmbed
