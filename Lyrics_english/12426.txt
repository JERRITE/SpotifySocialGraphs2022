When Doves Cry (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darlin'?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard (Oh-oh-oh)
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
[Chorus 1]
How can you just leave me standin' (Standin')
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demandin' (Demandin')
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother (Like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's nеver satisfied)
Why do we scrеam at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch, if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

[Chorus 2]
How can you just leave me standin' (Standin')
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demandin' (Demandin')
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother (Like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Chorus 3]
How can you just leave me standin'
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demandin' (Demandin', baby)
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold (Oh, ma-ma-ma, ooh-no-ooh-oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
