Everything Is Fine Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think the whole world's crazy
I don't want to leave my bedroom
There's a devil on my shoulder
And a monster in the television
Set me up for failure
All I wanted was some options
But my only choice is leaving
Like time is not a crocodile

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't mind
I don't mind
[Chorus]
Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
If I don't care

[Verse 2]
Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]
Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
And it makes it all ok if I don't care
(If I don't care)

Everything's alright (I don't mind)
Everything is fine (I don't mind)
Everything's alright (I don't mind)

[Chorus]
Everything is fine and nothing matters
(Nothing really matters at all)
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
I slept through another day
And it makes it all ok if I don't care3Embed
