Do not say anything lyrics [letter of "don't say anything"]

[Intro]
I know well
That tonight you want to see me
It doesn't matter that you are with him
You will only turn off the cel
And you will see the dawn

We will end together in my room
Tonight is one of the two
As we wanted
I needed it
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything
And I needed it
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything



3 in the morning
And only I want to see
Like your dress
It begins to fall
How time is gold
You can not lose
Tell what are you going to do
Almost dawn

I'm just giving you more happiness
That's why you always look for me
Do you want more
In the end with me you would like to stay
You say I'm your weakness
You might also liked
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything
And I needed it
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything

Just you and me
Lose ourselves
Let's make the night
Forget the clock
You want the same
Mommy tell me if not
That nobody finds out about what
Here it happened

I'm just giving you more happiness
That's why you always look for me
Do you want more
In the end with me you would like to stay
You say I'm your weakness
I know well
That tonight you want to see me
It doesn't matter that you are with him
You will only turn off the cel
And you will see the dawn

We will end together in my room
Tonight is one of the two
As we wanted

I needed it
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything
And I needed it
Tonight does not end
Let's wait together at dawn
That your boyfriend of this does not know anything
Do not say anything

Yeah Yeah
