Lyrics rebelled [letter from "rebelled"]

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
If it's about loving, I don't mention it anymore
He says she is tired of illusions
He got tired of suffering from bad decisions
She was not like that when I met her

[Chorus]
It revealed
He doesn't want anyone, he says he got tired
He prefers to be single, from the past he forgot
Neither chocolate, nor flowers, it's over, he rebelled
[Verse 1]
He leaves at night and arrives for the day
Alcohol blame
He says that he is not yet loved
Single she has a better time (Yeah)
He doesn't want anything serious
Nor does he want to fall in love
With none of these fools' he will tie
He rebelled because he doesn't want to get excited

[Pre-car]
And he will not return
With other arms will not return
Love is no longer your need
Now it is put for evil
And he will not return
In other arms it will no longer return
Love is no longer your need
He got tired of such falsehood

[Chorus]
It revealed
He doesn't want anyone, he says he got tired
He prefers to be single, from the past he forgot
Neither chocolate, nor flowers, it's over, he rebelled

He will not cry anymore, now he will go out
Everything does not matter (it does not matter)
Nothing will feel (Yeah, Yeah)
Now you get drunk and send you a photo
Telling you that it is better without you
That does not have a broken heart
And that because of yours she is like that

[Bridge]
Delete his profile photo
For you nothing will feel
Your heart will no longer open
Not a tear for you
He erased his profile picture
For you nothing will feel
He already forgot you

[Chorus]
It revealed
He doesn't want anyone, he says he got tired
He prefers to be single, from the past he forgot
Neither chocolate nor flowers, it's over, he rebelled, Hmm
