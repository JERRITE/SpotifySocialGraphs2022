Silhouette lyrics [The lyrics "Silhouette"]

[Verse 1: endgrades]
A light silhouette will sneak, behind him, like a psycho, wandered at night
The wind hugs me gently, everything is without sadness
How to find you and how you generally, let's tell me
What is the soul? What are the thoughts? Please just don't be silent
Behind us are clouds, dust, evil message
The bitches tried to knock down the way, took and shaved
Worthy to move and live only in high
Let's promise to carry it through years
Give everything the same fire
In an empty block without you, I suffocate, yet
When we know, I know, I dissolve
Fundamental love, and I will repeat the word in word
These pieces are your power when I am happy - I sing
[Bridge: End Shpil]
One person fell in love with another
How boring and how many such stories
Remember, I got fire for you
And we are already running from Praetory

[Chorus: Miyagi]
It was hard, but we ran into the light
I will draw your silhouette clouds
The unshakable faith found the answer
To those questions that so often tormented you, dear
It was hard, but we ran into the light
I will draw your silhouette clouds
The unshakable faith found the answer
To those questions that so often tormented you, dear

[Verse 2: miyagi]
In the pool of the eyes of relatives, he could not remain indifferent
About reefs broke a wave
Was a naughty cold wind for you
I will flash the lines in the sunset, which we need so much
Destined to be launched
The nerves spoke to us times
The soul is burning
Sings about how it was warm and sad here
Let's whisper on your
My love for you is art

Thoughts about the high did not leave us here
I tried to make only the purest sound
Hot fires I diluted leisure
And you and I watched ghostly beauty
Thoughts about the high did not leave us here
I tried to make only the purest sound
Hot fires I diluted leisure
And you and I watched ghostly beauty

[Ekuphav: Miyagi]
It was hard, but we ran into the light
I will draw your silhouette clouds
The unshakable faith found the answer
To those questions that so often tormented you, dear

[Chorus: Miyagi]
It was hard, but we ran into the light
I will draw your silhouette clouds
The unshakable faith found the answer
To those questions that so often tormented you, dear 7mbed
