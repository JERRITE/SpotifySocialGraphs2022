Connoisseur Ambassador lyrics [verse]
You empty your mouth like a magazine
And dreams about how clearly it rhymes when you pack your lines
Talking like a ninja, quick and sharp
You shouldn't 'rap' you should grow karate
We 'acid and separate, not' controlled by the smart
Sickly created sickly rap, toxic as a python snake
We murder the industry, crashing on the ramp
A few guys who are expensive as fees in the bank
This it 'original, no joke
It 'spokesline on track, that muck is wrong
It is not going to be strong as car chase and billiards
But did we get money for every beat - then we had a billion
No chiliart, burning like we do
Danish Rap, Feinschmecker, Connaisseur Ambassador
Crunchy not 'for bass'Ã¸re, no fixed driver
That slam mazda doors, lives off pasta until we die
SPASER HEAR IT 'NOT' A SUPPLY
To the shitap you hear, you can 'suck' the long
This is the 'more super duper tight
From a pair of dudes that can hug with looped long songs and
Sku 'you have' a urge to snore on beats
In a time when it has become a sport to be G's
And spit 'empty words like the short newspaper
Should you know that we are not able to do it fisyou Might Also Likeembed
