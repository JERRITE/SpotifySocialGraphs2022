Walking In Circles LyricsQuiet
Everyone's sleeping through life
Afraid that their questions
Just might have answers
Quiet
Everyone shut off their mind
So I'll turn on mine
Alone in a world
With millions of souls
Walking in circles
Trapped in their dreams
Unhealthy, unclean
Walking in circles, now
Do not disturb
Scream in silence
Everyone's sleeping

Quiet
We're living inside of our mouths
Afraid someone just might
Hear what we're thinking
Quiet
Careful of what you might say
Cause they'll put you away

Alone in a world
With millions of souls
Walking in circles
(Walking in circles)
Trapped in their dreams
Unhealthy, unclean
Walking in circles, now
Do not disturb
Scream in silence
Everyone's sleeping

Alone in a world
With millions of souls
Walking in circles
(Walking in circles)
Trapped in their dreams
Unhealthy, unclean
Walking in circles, now
Do not disturb
Scream in silence
Everyone's sleeping

With millions of souls (Walking in circles, now)
Walking in circles (Walking in circles, now)
Alone in a world (Walking in circles)
With millions of souls (Walking in circles)
Walking in circles, now
Do not disturb
Scream in silence
Everyone's sleeping6Embed
