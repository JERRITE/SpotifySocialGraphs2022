Salvation Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are the avalanche
One world away
My make believing
While I'm wide awake

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a trick of light
To bring me back around again
Those wild eyes
A psychedelic silhouette
[Chorus]
I never meant to fall for you, but I
Was buried underneath
And all that I could see was white

[Hook]
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You are the snowstorm
I'm purified
The darkest fairytale
In the dead of night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let the band play out
As I'm making my way home again
Glorious, we transcend
Into a psychedelic silhouette

[Chorus]
I never meant to fall for you, but I
Was buried underneath
And all that I could see was white
[Hook]
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Outro]
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, my
My salvation, my, myYou might also like6Embed
