TranslationsPortuguÃªsSmall Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh my mind!
I walk down Mayflower Road again
The wailing sun
Echoes from the park seem so absurd

The bus takes hours
I knew it would, but I can't shake the sting
Can't spend my time
On everybody else
If buildings fell
At least we'd be in matrimony
I can't control
The words kaleidoscope inside my head

[Chorus]
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

[Verse 2]
I saw the police
Screaming something trivial
Like, "Keep the peace!"
The world moves on and you can't shake the sound

I know she's home
Waiting on somebody
Loathe in light
All in my mind
The anvil and the weight upon my back
You might also like[Chorus]
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

[Chorus]
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

And I can't see, my love

[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things, they gather round me
Gather round me

And I can't see, my love

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(And I can't see, my love)13Embed
