​if we never met (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: John K]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met

[Verse 1: John K]
What if I never started singing?
What if you never, told your family you were leaving?
When you felt the pressure
There's a million different reasons
We shouldn't be together
But when I put it all together
[Pre-Chorus 1: John K, Kelsea Ballerini & Both]
It all comes back to you, you, you
I love it when the only light is me, you, and the moon (Moon)
And baby, when I close my eyes, I'm thinkin' about

[Chorus: John K & Kelsea Ballerini]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met

[Verse 2: Kelsea Ballerini]
Yeah
What if I would've left the party?
What if you never, look twice when you saw me?
In your favorite sweater
It must've been for a reason
For worse or better
'Cause when I put it all together

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kelsea Ballerini]
It all comes back to you, you, you
I love it when the city lights, bring out all the blue, ooh-ooh
Like when I'm lookin' in your eyes, and I realize
You might also like[Chorus: John K & Kelsea Ballerini]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed (One else's bed)
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't (I wouldn't even know), even know what love is (Love is)
If we never met, oh-oh

[Outro: John K & Kelsea Ballerini, Kelsea Ballerini]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
If we never met
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
