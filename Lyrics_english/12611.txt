Morocco Lyrics[Verse 1: Alina Baraz]
My favorite view
Is me covered in you
Nothing but my perfume
Oh, I love the taste of you
Turquoise bedroom
Crystal clear, ocean view
Play some, Badu, please do
Oh, on and on and on and on

[Chorus: Alina Baraz & 6LACK]
Yeah, you take me to another time zone (Time zone)
Without ever even leavin' my door
Steady ride it to another life though (Life though)
Oh, I look up and we in Morocco
[Post-Chorus: Alina Baraz]

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Okay, now my face (Yeah), your throne
Baby girl, daddy's home, and we're still goin' strong
I'ma pick her up and then it's on
Ain't no neighbors on the top floor, now we in Morocco
Baby cold, I can make her hot though
Come again, oh, you want an encore?
My face, your throne
Baby girl, daddy's home, six zone goin' strong, yeah

[Chorus: Alina Baraz with 6LACK]

Steady ride it to another life though
Oh, I look up and we in Morocco
