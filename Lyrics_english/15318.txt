Say Iâ€™m Wrong LyricsI don't wanna wonder if you love me
I just wanna know this much is true
I've searchin' for a purpose, but I've found someone in you
And now I'm asking questions baby and I can't stop the feelings I've had
Am I headed for some trouble in this windy heart train track
Way way way too long
I've been tryna get through to you, tell me what should I do
Say say say I'm wrong
If standing up for this is wrong, then I don't wanna be right yeah
Staying up all night with you is a gift that I won't forget
Make out sessions in the dark like the times when we first met
Making love on the bedroom floor in the night while your parents slept
We would laugh and whisper until the morning sunlight crept in
We don't talk much like we used to do
And I miss our silly conversations
Please tell me should I stop loving you?
'Cause I don't think I could even if I tried
Whoa oh
Way way way too long
I've been tryna get through to you, tell me what should I do
Say say say I'm wrong
If standing up for this is wrong, then I don't wanna be right yeah
We don't talk much like we used to, and I miss our silly conversations
Please tell me should I stop loving you?
'Cause I don't think I could even if I tried
Whoa oh
Way way way too long
I've been tryna get through to you, tell me what should I do
Say say say I'm wrong
If standing up for this is wrong, then I don't wanna be right yeah
Way way way too long
I've been tryna get through to you, tell me what should I do
Say say say I'm wrong
If standing up for this is wrong, then I don't wanna be right yeahYou might also likeEmbed
