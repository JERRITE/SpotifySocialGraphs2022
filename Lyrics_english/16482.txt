Angel Eyes (Home and Away) LyricsI pay the price for cheap advice

Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away
So now I’m gonna take that all that I can get
With those angel eyes
You make saints do sins all the time

Say I’m gonna stay, home and away, well well
When I said I’d catch you when you’re falling
I’d have my heart open wide
And you who’s not naive I thought
Say I’d thought I’d mend my heart
People say I’m so automatic
People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
And time and time again I walk on by
With the look of love

And with those angel eyes, woh woh
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
C’mon now baby

The saddest thing I’ve ever seen on my TV screen
Was the dying man who died for his dream
The toughest thing I’ve ever heard
Was that new-born scream in this naked world

People say I’m so automatic
People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
And time and time again I walk on by
With the look of love

And with those angel eyes, woh woh
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
C’mon now baby

Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
I love her

Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
I love her

Say I’m gonna stay home and away
Should a little loving gotta make you smile girl
Say I’m gonna stay home and away

People say that I’m so automatic
People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
Been all around those edges
But ain’t never been in love
Ain’t never been in love before babe
Never been in love
Never been in love

Set me on fire, baby
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
Set me on fire, fire

And with those angel eyes
And with those angel eyes
And with those angel eyes
Everything’s gonna be alright
Everything’s gonna be alright now babeEmbed
