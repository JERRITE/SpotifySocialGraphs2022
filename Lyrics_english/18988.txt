DEATH SQUAD Lyrics[Intro]
A twenty-minute song
It's not actually twenty minutes
Duey! Put on something creative
Duey, you're so fucking DIRTY, hehehe
Oh boy
Is there any way that I can put a melody over this?
No
Yeah! I am the melody
Yuh
[Verse 1: (PROD. DUEY DIRTY)]
Hate me, nigga, hate me
You a dummy, funny lady
I’ll name you Katie
Talking shit, you like a baby
I cannot understand
I keep that commie Tommy gun under my pants
In my hands
Make you dance
Fuck a no melody
I am the melody
Kill the beat Marric and I catching felonies
I am not listening to what you’re telling me
I am not buying the shit that you’re selling me
I’m in the cut with Sir Duey, he dirty
I’m making this art 'til I’m well over thirty
Or forty, you buying that clout, get aborted
You niggas unworthy of being awarded
For anything other than being recorded
As some of the worst niggas labeled important
Go put some more in
You like a moron, I ain't talking foreign
But, nigga, I’m touring
Keep up the pouring
That poison yo organs
I'll keep putting powder front of my forehead
Popping them pills
'Til these artists, there’s more dead
Ain't snorting nothing but smarties and warheads (Yay)

Huh, huh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I'm like, and I'm like, hmm
(WENDIGO x DILLINGER beat)
(Real trap shit)
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you bitches
Go say what you want about me and my riches
You faking statistics
These niggas be leaving they lipstick on top of my dick tip
Pussy, I whiff it from miles away (Okay)
I will never work with niggas that do shit for clout 'cause they dry like a pile of hay (Yuh)
Ain’t nothing new nigga (Yuh)
Ain’t shit to do withcha (Yuh)
I’m pushing shit like Van Gogh or Kanye
In the van, go from LA to The Bay and then back
'Cause I’m very much missing my bae (My bae)
Hair on my dick and my face and I shave it with mace and erase it
Flow into the drain
Ain't came here to play
What you wan' say?
One of these days I'ma blow up like Hiroshima
No, sir, I don’t buy no plays
I don’t even care if you listen
You shitting or pissing
You ain't missing nothing important
Bitch, it’s a blessing that through all the stressing
I get to take what I imagine and form it
You an informant
As in you know about me
You informing the people
You scorn it
Aren’t you bored yet?
To get that clout, all these fakers will forge it
I am so pure and so gorgeous
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you whores
Pimples in all of your pores
Walk on all fours, can't open doors
Where are my thumbs? I am too dumb
I’m sick of you niggas, I’m sick of you bitches
Go say what you want about me and my riches
I'm swimming in ditches, I'm dipping through gullies
I keep an eye open like Mike who with Sully
I'm bitchin', I'm bitchin' niggas in the kitchen whippin'
I'ma grip a stick and I'ma stir slowly
Niggas be wishing the worst for me
I'ma do me, I'm my own homie
Don't owe you nothing, you don't know me
Ain't wrote for me
I grip a stick, I wrote a poem not a rap
I'll be slapping when the money’s bottle caps
Fall out
With niggas that care about all clout
I'm hanging with WENDIGO
We in New York and we sticker the city
I'm hanging with DILLINGER spitting it witty
I rap on the track like I diddle her kitty
Fast, I get an O for like fiddy
Gas, no, I don't smoke with no biddy
Pass, Spider Gang titty committee
Ass
[Verse 3: (Prod. SOLSA)]
(Shoutout that cute ass nigga Chris, mwah nigga)
Helter skelter
Kill all the beatnicks
Kill all the faggots
And anyone who seek dicks
Face tats and fake plays, uh
Waste cash and make no moves
I got bass cracking my plays, uh
Raise dragon live channel number 2
My mama told me sideways
I would have to get outside, find my place, uh
My mama shares my migraines
Look too hard at me, might get eye pains, uh
Lipstick on my limp dick
Mommy, I want a skateboard
Mommy, I want to rape whores
Mommy, where’s daddy?
Mommy, what that man came for? (Oh)
I don’t like you
I don’t appreciate your tone of voice when you talking to me
Up in a tree, I am so free, caw
Who want to breed with me? (Ah)
Make more of me, make more of me
You are my spawn, look up and feed
I'm in a tree like we KND
Dirty apollo kaka and mazi
Solsa down under he sipping his pee
Hanging a wallaby up in a tree (Ha, ha)
I’m gonna rap like Eminem this time
Spam
A tin can of some ham, lamb, and damn man
Having a grand slam, jabbing it
Mad stamina, damn it
Can famine and cramming an animal
Into a pan, damage the cannibal Hannibal’s hands
Bird berry, walk in my Burberrys, I herd Mary
Edible eating credible medical speaking fellow
My turd scary, smelling like burnt Mary
A word fairy
How did he learn? Where’d he intern?
Fern carrying
With a stern stare, he’ll burn holes in your mental
Fennel seed scent
With a rental key to event
I got lots of tea if you spending
Ain’t meant to be in your business
I gotta go pay the rent
I’m giving up tree for Lent
I’m beating it 'til it bent

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no
Stop it

[Verse 4: (Prod. LUISPRODUCEDIT)]
Great, great, great
A couple people in my face, face, face
No other nigga’s songs dropping like the bass, bass, bass do
Thunder blunt, keep it a hunnid, some it laced, laced, K-2
At the summit, ho, you want it take it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, fool
Why you running from the nothing in ya heart? It always catch up
Go and buy some marijuana, I forgot my fucking ketchup
If you step up, better have some shit to say, say, say, to me
Don't waste my time it isn’t real in the first place, fool
I like hairy bitches, uh
I like hairy bitches, uh
Bitches with hair, uh, hmm
I like hairy bitches, uh
I like hairy bitches, uh
Bitches with hair, uh
I'ma do this shit eleven hours in advance
Hey, Luis, do yo dance
Give 8XNE8 back his bands, scammer
If he talking shit I gotta hit him with the ban hammer, ugh
If you hear this nigga, I know that you can't handle
I don't gotta cook a story gripping on a panhandle, ugh
What you talking 'bout? (Uh) Nigga who is that?
Fuck a fake friend, all you pussy bitches stupid cap
Got it out my system like my fecal with the sewer rats
Shaka laka zulu, huh
New year, thirty new yous
What we should do
Is move the fuck on, huh
Walk through the valley, yes, I walk through the rain
And the puddles, nigga, do not get it muddled
All these humans are insane, huh
Half metal Kaiba with a blade runner
Moving like a wave in a cave
Hunter aiming at yo brain
Brain, brain, brain liquid
I feel like Eddy, grip machete
I'm addicted
But not by definition 'cause I kicked it
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Men have become truly weak (Wow)
Why are they abusing me?
Why are they abusing me?
Why are they abusing me? (Wow)
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep
Fl.vco needs his beauty sleep (Wow)
Men have become truly weak
Why are they abusing me?
When I've become truly weak (Wow)
(Yuh, yuh, nah, nah)
(Yuh, yuh, nah, nah, okay)

[Verse 5: (Prod. CXRPSE)]
Shoutout Cadaver, yuh
Hahahahahaha
And for the record, screaming "Yuh" behind your own vocals is overplayed
Punk ass niggas
I will make your corpse dance (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will make your corpse dance, your corpse dance
I will make your corpse dance, your corpse dance
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Look both ways before you cross the street
Jumping niggas, Frogger, a logger, I'm smoking down a tree
Rotating blades bring him to his feet (Vroom, vroom)
(Staring at you, sipping my lager, I'm standing down the street)
Care about my kin, I'm a father, but do not bow to me
Bow to god, bow to her pussy that drippin' on your meat
Why you never holler unless you got something else you need?
Bitch, I ain't the caller, there’s many niggas who be like me
Feel like me, feel not free, huh
"Sand nigga, dune coon," I heard it all before
Up in the schoolyard, ooh
Bitch that hurt my feelings, I will put you in the fucking floor
Yo soda purple, must be sipping on that codeine
My soda yellow, hydrochloride what a ho mean
Talking promethazine, I will fuck you and your homies
I’m a whore nigga, got some balls? Then show me
Go pee (Psss), on my face, I got no teeth
Water tap on bloody bony finger, Tony!
In New York I sock your cronies if they phony
I'm lonely, my only friends are toy ponies (I'm lonely)

[Verse 6: (Prod. THRAXX)]
Ayy, shoutout that nigga THRAXX, man
Haha, shoutout that nigga THRAXX, haha
Yuh
THRAXX
Fendi, Prada, Gucci on my waist, huh
Then your daughter coochie at my place, huh
Then I slaughter booty like a race, huh
When she gotta poopy, do me face! Yes
That way you can waste less, Hollywood faggot
Shove it up ya ass and then drag it
I'm a hot bitch if I drag it
Bag him and tag it, uh
Don’t get mad at me, I'm a faggot
Walking down Sunset Boulevard, I've had it
BRUHMANE asking what I'm mad at
All of that fag scat
Pussy chatter like he Claptrap
Nap sack full of marijuana and some rap cap
Hate on me all you want, you leave comments on my shit
Companies are scared to post me, prolly ran by half a bitch
You keep race a thing we tripping on, but I don’t give a damn, uh
Color myself in with sharpie just because I can
Yo choppa kill niggas, buss until they dead
My choppa heal niggas, bussin' at they heads
Yo choppa feel bigger, fill it with some lead
My choppa real hitter, I hide it from the Feds
Yo choppa kill niggas, buss until they dead
My choppa heal niggas, bussin' at they heads
Yo choppa feel bigger, fill it with some lead
My choppa real hitter, I hide it from the Feds
[Verse 7: (Prod. CRMSYN)]
Niggas really need to stop, fuck sittin' with us, man
Spider Gang shit
I'm off a quaalude, right now
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Lil tranny goin' thirty, I see jay in her lips
Is it gay? Give a shit
Lay you out like my fit
Like a piggy in Hawaii, getting hot up in the pit
Lit a ciggy at the light and then pass it like a spliff
I'm dirty ass nigga, grip her hips at the party
Go stupid, go retarded, make a scene if you get carded
I’m an artist, possibly the hardest ever hit a beat
Sorry, got my nut up on yo fitted sheet
Nigga, how you been this week?
Tell me while she finish me
I am never industry
Semen like I'm in this meat
Streaming down yo sister cheek
Yo plug got a fist of weed
Bitch, go use some Listerine
Or maybe some Mr. Clean
'Til yo mouth is blistering
Headlights bright, hemp wick on my light
In-N-Out Tray Cluch, CRMSYN rolling outta sight
Pack the cookies down tight, then we stop for a bite
Got the fries on my left, lemonade on my right
Outta sight
Rolling so the pine tree bounce around
Never outta green because we always keep an ounce around
RAW paper packet, got the tucks and I attack it
Smoking bleached shit, you ain't got the sharpest tool to hack it
Put it bluntly, can’t receive a dime and try to front me
Then you shouldn’t tell me that you want weed
Tell that fucking cunt, "Leave"
Riding too high to keep a downer round
Turning up a pounding sound
Roll and pass around a pound
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick
Go stupid for dumb little bitch with a dick

[Verse 8: (Prod. LIL DARKIE)]
I produced this song
I made this beat
I'm so proud of myself
Shoutout Johnnascus
Johnny boy, Johnny boy
Playing with his army toys
Johnny tell his mother
Let him hang out with the brawny boys
Scrawny as he is
He hold his own against the bully
He pull out his hair and yell at them
They aren't fully people
Then they beat the fuck out the kid 'cause they want to
Piss on his chucks if he think he know Kung Fu
Bear that he hug tight, take it, now it’s gone too
Off his head with the bite of his front tooth
Bitch what you gon' do?
Outta sight, boutta fight, but he hesitate
Tongue he bite 'til he tell the bigger fella, "Wait it isn’t right"
Pulled out his cabella knife and gut the motherfucker
Ayy, you sucker, tell the others
If they come around this way you getting stuck up
Did I stutter?
Run from Johnny, he’s crazy
"Mommy, I think johnny has rabies"
Save me, that little boy is shady

[Verse 9: (Prod. SONNATIC)]
SONNATIC, wake the fuck up
SONNATIC, wake up SONNATIC
SONNATIC, wake up SONNATIC!
Rickety stick hit Cedric Diggory
Wicker man lit, you sick of me, picket me
Know I been tied up
Finger bobby pin he prick
Backwood lobby, suck my dick
Burn down the hotel like a wick
Wick, wick, flick Bic
Like I said one million times
I feel lightning fill my spine
Sucking, biting when they rhyme
Pissy face, I lick a lime
Kiss my dick tip, you a dime
Keep a quarter in my mind
All times
I don't give one fuck about meeting a nigga
These little ass kids on IG with they pictures
I went to school and I read all my scriptures
Maybe then God will let me into heaven
And I can look down at the pedophile reverends
That burning in hell for not learning they lessons
Steady molesting, no biblical sessions
Ayy, that’s the nigga that gave me depression
What’s up?
Oh hey, just burning eternally
Oh, cool
Wish it was that simple
How to pop a pimple
Squeeze until you bleed
I got momma dimples right up on my cheeks
I am up in the dead of night (Hmm)
Fall in love if you fed him right, yuh
Bitch, I'm up in the dead of night (Hmm, hmm)
Yuh, yeah, yeah, yuh, huh
Rat race, okay
Move your feet if you wit' it
Searching back page, okay
All the cool shit got deleted, got a flat face (Whoo)
My Asian bitch got a fat waist
All you pussy niggas are in last place
All these pussy niggas, know you're shit
All these pussy niggas, know you're shit
Shoutout Killtak
[Verse 10: (Prod. MUPPY)]
So, I just really want this one to sound like a steaming pile of shit
(Listen Muppy, make this beat sound like garbage, mate)
Alright? Oi (At a reasonable miles per hour)
I just took a whip it in the back of my friend’s whip (Okay)
Whip it if the cops wanna start shit, we end it (Yuh)
I just popped a LEMON Quaalude, I was lended
You just on the Xannies, Perc' 30, you pretending
I took off her panties, work dirty like my collar blue
My dollars blue
Niggas paying Darkie for a comment and a follow too
Hollow foo, industry will swallow you, all of you
Where that nigga Yahweh you was callin' too
Nowhere, nowhere to be found
See you pound on your head
He has to be around, right?
Sound bites, as in wave eats
He don’t save fleets
Say please, bitch, you will obey me, nigga
Hey team! Let’s go make a movie should be way clean
Lights, camera, dick under my UZI with a gay beam
Spray cream
Hahaha, yuh, uh
Oh, man, I'm so gay
Meth-head, lay down on my death bed
Oh yeah!
I love the way it hold me so bad
Oh man!
Nigga send the digits if you will not send a fucking location
I'm that nigga usually cool but now I got no patience
Pussy niggas speaking on me unwisely
Pussy niggas tweak in they tweets most likely
Would these niggas get on they feet? Advise me
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene (Whee)
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene (Ooh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, no Visene
I can see you clear off this weed, and I’m high, G
Dirty nigga, take care of your personal hygiene
I can see you, I spy with my little eye
A little man, small fry on his inner thigh
Hop a fence, leave yo grandma behind
I feel something tense, wrap around and it bind, yuh
Now I know what you're thinking
This song is getting kinda to the end (True)
That means some cool shit is about to happen
[Verse 11: (Prod. LIL CUBENSIS)]
Ayy, CUBENSIS, play the beat
Hahaha, this nigga sound hairy, hahahaha
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout?
Bitch, you hella pussy
Many kitties flockin' round
In yo city, talking loud
I can see you walking out
While I'm rapping
I'm a dog owner
I yell at the cat then
Kick his backend, uh
I know why these niggas yapping
'Cause they mad that I'm attacking
Everything they holding dear
Being racist, live in fear
Being hateful, Killing queers
Let a Darkie smoke marijuana while walking trail of tears
Bitch, I rip out my hair, I wanna put niggas on they rears
You can say what you ponder, we kinda don't even need you here
Suicide, commit suicide, yeah, I tried to
Sad, turned mad when I figured I was lied to, huh
What the fuck you offer to a nigga like me?
Run that shit back to the curb, off a nigga, we’ll see
In the cut, sew it up, dealing stitches, no fee
Straight mixing up this shit, bathwater, cup of tea
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh
My boys on my back
12 pull up when we shooting for a track, wack
Slide to the crib in the back
Baby ass kid got a bib for the yak
Black
Sky with the brake dust
And under it gun they make bust
And under it LA break trust
And under it all they fake us like
Mannequins up in the pike
These Anakin bitches is killing the light
Sike
I’m biking bitch go take hike
I ain't yo Darkie and you ain't my type, yuh
Light fire to grass get water or rock on it
Ground pound like I taught her to hop on it
Round sound, no squares in my circle
One loud round when we passing the purple
No bumming, no hits off of Brahman, I call that shit robbin'
He leave you red like a robin
Birdie hop out of the nest without wearing a vest
On his chest, already mobbin'
Pull up and you stutter
My face in the neon, it making you panic (Panic, huh)
Manic depressive unless I got blunt in my face
Little boy, what you be on? What’s happening?
Faking (Ugh), illusions and smoke on reflectors
They never said they protectors (Ugh)
Protect us I bet, then wet us
Let us be sheep for the lettuce (Ugh)
Get us
They judge us ain't even met us
I gotta hop on my shit right quick (Ugh)
We swimming the current, they trying to net us
Curran put bruv on the shit right quick
'Til Spider Gang get up

[Outro]
That's the whole song
It's done right now16Embed
