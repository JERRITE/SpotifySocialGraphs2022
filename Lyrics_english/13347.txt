Tammy Faye Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know how I get
With my Tammy Faye eyes
Crying, I'm a mess
Half undressed in the light of the TV

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you'll just have to go bury this
In the garden and leave it till there's nothing left
For me to find, when I try to dig it up
And bring it back to life
[Chorus]
'Cause you know how I get
I love you so madly like Sadie Mae
But I'm just a crazy bitch
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette (Tammy Wynette)
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette

[Verse 2]
But it's just how I get
With my Tammy Faye eyes
Blood on my clothes and my hands
I've done it again, I've done it again

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you'll just have to go bury this
In the garden and leave it till there's nothing left
For me to find, when I try to dig it up
And bring it back to life

[Chorus]
'Cause you know how I get
I love you so madly like Sadie Mae
But I'm just a crazy bitch
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette (Tammy Wynette)

[Outro]
'Cause I shoot the gun any chance I get (Sadie Mae)
With blood on my clothes and my hands
I've done it again, I've done it againYou might also like1Embed
