Take Over the World Lyrics[Verse 1]
I looked into her eyes, and I swore
I've never written a cliché before
And I'll probably never do so
She was beautiful, though

[Chorus]
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

[Verse 2]
I'm only a paperboy from the North West
But I can scrub up well in my Sunday best
How could I ever do for you? Because I'm true
And I'm real, and this is how I feel
[Chorus]
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

[Verse 3]
A glossy magazine on the coffee table
That you've held court
With half of the culprits in there
Who seem unstable
But you don't look at them like you do at me

[Bridge]
Those eyes are only mine
What a wonderful time
When your eyes are mine, and mine are yours

I turn over in bed, but you're not there
Nowhere to be seen
All I can do is flip the Mac and gently touch the screen

[Chorus]
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world
I think it's time for me and you to take over the world

[Outro]
Take over the world
Take over the world
Take over the world
Take over the worldYou might also likeEmbed
