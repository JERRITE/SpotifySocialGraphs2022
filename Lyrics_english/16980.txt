Vanish Lyrics[Chorus: Ouija Macc]
I just wanna vanish
Be the blank canvas
Young white cloth for the brain damage
I just wanna vanish
No one understand this
I just wanna vanish
I just wanna vanish
I just wanna disappear
Evaporate
Fog in the wilderness
Dissipate
I will become crystal clear in the lake
Free my ashes from the cliff by the lake
[Verse 1: Ouija Macc]
Baby degenerate throw me away
My life a mist and I'm gone in a spray
Bacc from the dust I'm a skeleton grey
Take me away
Save me from my dreams not the ones that I can see but the ones that I forget
I can feel them taking heed
Into the abyss
Nothing on my wrist
Nothing on my necc
No one in my whip
Just a single bullet exiting the clip
Liberated from the chamber with nothing in the clip
Look into my eyes I am reading your design
Nothing complicated you're a library of lies
Stop thinking your thoughts when I am offering you mine
Led you to my water but to drink it is to die

(Reversed message)

[Chorus: Ouija Macc]
I just wanna vanish
Be the blank canvas
Young white cloth for the brain damage
I just wanna vanish
No one understand this
I just wanna vanish
I just wanna vanish

I just wanna go missing (gone)
Cause y'all niggas ain't really listening (nope)
Third album y'all hate on my vision (yep)
Killing shit and I'm so consistent
Real spit and I'm so insistent
I guess it don't make no difference
Unless you can't go the distance
Cause your fate comes at an instant
It can be somewhat hard to deal with it
So we take drugs until we can't feel shit
Fuck hoes, Get drunk and stay real lit
Jump right on the mic and get ill with it
All on your neck and we ain't letting up
We know you bitches is scared of us
Just getting started we revvin' up
Warm my engine up!
Rockstar nigga fuck different sluts (Hefner)
Blocc star nigga wanna stack the bucks
MonStar nigga wanna "Lyte" you up!
I just wanna vanish (ghost)
My side chick is Spanish (local)
21 killers with me bruh all them niggas savage
Your team looking shitty (ew!)
We got the advantage (hatchet)
Feel the hate in your stands we know that you can't stand us (Mad!)
(?)
Tryna cop the fam you ain't Gangus (nah)
They don't we all not strangers
All over the world we famous but..
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ouija Macc]
Walk into the door
I don't fall apart
Scavenging my bones you won't find a heart
I am just remains
Memory to fade
Hope that they remember me when looking at the stains
Moving through the streets look like I ain't got no legs
Ouija move on energy and levitate on faith
Everything is clear to me we are human waste
People can be saved but for some that ain't the case
I'm within the upside down
What goes up it must come down
As you travel through the smoke with me write all your feelings down
Send them to me in a message
We will figure this place out
We all need our own way out I'm practicing my vantage now
Let me rot
Blood clot
I'm not talking just to talk
I'm not saying this to say this leave these crows all on my blocc
Jammed pacced up in that show a street down from where they shot Pac
Its the memoirs of the lost
Music gutter water drops Ay
