Far from here Lyrics [letter from "away from here"]

[Bridge 1]
I know, I know, what are you crazy crazy to have me
I know it, I tell you that, that I am also crazy about having you
To leave, far from here and from here
To leave, I and you next to me

[Chorus]
Kiss me in your mouth like this and so (uoh, wouh, woh)
Remove your clothes on me
Then we exchange, I above you (ah, ah, ah)
Making love as you like you (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Get naked (OH), let the silhouette see
Of your body when you eat you complete (Yeah, Yeah)
You have the recipe, you are so flirtatious
Your beauty is out of this planet (Yeah, Yeah)
I'm dying to dawn with you in the morning
To take breakfast to bed (bed)
If I don't see you one day (OH), it looks like a week
When night falls, mommy, your body calls me (Yeah)

[Saying]
And if you want to feel and I want to feel you
Vamo 'to have a good time
I stimulate my senses increases my beats
When I'm close to your skin
