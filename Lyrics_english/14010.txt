L.S.F. LyricsPicture yourself on the Mount called Olivet
You're standin' with Jesus ... a marvelous time
Then while you talk He begins to rise slowly -- and gives you His final goodbyes
Aeroplane flyers were seldomly seen down in Jerusalem then
Look for the Lord with the sun in your eyes and He's gone!
Lookee, in the sky, He's flyin'! REPEAT
Following that there appear on the mountain a couple of angels in garments so white
"Ye men of Galilee," they say, "please tell us how come you still stare at the sky?
Soon He'll be back, He'll appear as before where He was taken away
When He comes back, He'll descend through the clouds." Then they're gone!
Lookee, in the sky, you'll find Him! REPEAT
Scripture foretells of a day we'll be taken
"The Rapture," they call it -- it's looking like time
Suddenly trumpets declare His return while the church will arise to go with Christ
Lookee, in the sky, we're flyin'! REPEATYou might also likeEmbed
