Hold It In Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jump into that water and see for yourself
Take a deep breath and hold it in, hold it in
She's got a secret and she wants to tell
But I made her promise to hold it in, hold it in
Maybe I'm in love and maybe it's starting to tell
Only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
Was told that I'm a man now and I'm not allowed to cry
Only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
Huh
[Chorus]
But life is
"Oh my God, if I tell him, he'll tell her, and then she will know I like her"
But good grief
I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
I will not hold it in
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

[Verse 3]
Well, there's the couple with a baby, and it's no secret why
Neither one was able to hold it in, hold it in
Kids in the streets, yeah, they're all getting high
Everybody's screaming, "Hold it in, hold it in"
Ha-hey

[Chorus]
But life is
"Oh my God, if I tell him, he'll tell her, and then she will know I like her"
Good grief
I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
I will not hold it in
Hoo!

[Verse 4]
If there's a God, He's embarrassed, and it's no secret why
Only thing that He can do is hold it in, hold itâ€” *gasp*
So I've written Him a letter to be sent out to sea
I'm looking for a bottle to hold it in, hold it in
Ha!
You might also like[Chorus]
But life is
"Oh my God, if I tell him, he'll tell her, and then she will know I like her"
But good grief
I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
I will not hold it in
Hoo!4Embed
