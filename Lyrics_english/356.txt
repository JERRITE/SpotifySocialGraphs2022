Ride With Me Lyrics[Chorus: Amber Ruthe & Kid Ink]
This dark sky, I know that we can make it bright
I promise if you ride with me
We'll find a better place to be
Baby, know I ride for you
Drive all night until golden years in lights
I promise if you ride with me
We will find a better place to be
You could ride around the world with me

[Post-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you could ride around the world with me (Kid ink)
[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
You know I be on some fly shit
Hero in the nighttime, I just need my sidekick
Sexy in that leather with the tight fit
Try to get between us, I'ma start a riot (Woo)
Love how shе roll it up (Roll it up)
They ain't know no room in this two-seater, you can't roll with us
It's gеttin' hot up in the city, but don't keep it tucked
I put that tenison on your neck, make sure you cold enough (Yeah)

[Chorus: Amber Ruthe & Kid Ink]
This dark sky, I know that we can make it bright
I promise if you ride with me
We'll find a better place to be
Baby, know I ride for you
Drive all night until golden years in lights
I promise if you ride with me
We will find a better place to be
You could ride around the world with me

[Post-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you could ride around the world with me

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Cede, hop in the black Mercedes
I'm driftin' like it's rainy
Baby, she strapped, safety
You catch me fallin', save me
I ball you out like granny
Them haters plottin', waitin'
Don't ever do me shady
Look in it
You might also like[Chorus: Amber Ruthe & Kid Ink]
This dark sky, I know that we can make it bright
I promise if you ride with me
We'll find a better place to be
Baby, know I ride for you
Find a better place to be

[Post-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you could ride around the world with me

[Outro: Amber Ruthe & Kid Ink]
This dark sky, I know that we can make it bright
I promise if you ride with me
We'll find an better place to be
You could ride around the world with me2Embed
