TranslationsPortuguês6 Five Heartbeats Lyrics[Sample: Eddie Griffin]
Blew-blew-blew-blew-blew
Lord, clearing out like roaches when the light come on
That motherfucker walk out, don't nobody know what happened
He still praying

[Intro: Vince Staples]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ayy
Yeah
[Verse: Vince Staples]
You had a blog; we had Berettas, ayy
Couldn't buy no birds; we fly together, ayy
How has every single rapper been a dopeman?
Really tryna kill, cuh, lift it up with both hands
Is you pushing for real? Talking rocks, Xans
I done slid enough to see a Glock jam
Couldn't take the heat, so you bought fan, yeah
Every stream freshwater; limousine tints sparkle
If I can't see you, you got something to hide
Told me all I ever do is fuck her and lie, yeah
At least you happy, though, bag Dior
My momma helped my daddy bag the dope—that's real love
I'm searching for some real love
Someone to set my heart free
Shot him on the eight-block, I hope nobody saw me
When there's problems, call me; they know the way my heart beat

[Outro]
I told you, you know how I am
You go on and sort him out, 'cause he wasn't cool 'round hereYou might also like1Embed
