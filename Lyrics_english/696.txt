You call me Lyrics [lyrics by "You call me"]

[Pre-car: Mark B&BAD Bunny]
They are so many thing 'that I want to do to you (I want to do to you)
To 'position them', mommy, I know (mommy, I know)
If you like smoke, you can 'turn' (I could 'turn'!)
When you feel alone

[Chorus: Mark B]
You just call me
You call me, you call me
I do it to you to 'the day
You call me
You call me, you call me
And I take it out to 'the day
[Post-car: Mark B]
Uoh, oh, only you and me
Uoh, oh, in the room
Uoh, oh, only you and me
Uoh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
Baby, what what?
You came when I touched you (eh), Yeh
I caused you (Skrt!)
That bumper I hit you (eh)
Calls me to give him
The toughest of RD (Yeh)
I hit you to the wall
I am your baby, you are my baby (-bé)
I have an iPhone pa 'when I call me'
Another pa 'record when I get it' (when I get it ')
These people throwing the game and I am the point of the win
Like a kilo, pa 'new york I uploaded you
I went to the Russo and looked for the Franco and the ruby
In to 'the poses I gave you
Listening to my theme 'and those of Mark B, Yeh

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & threateazzy]
And now you call me (-Mas)
You call me (-Mas), you call me (-Mas)
(And I do it to 'the day)
Now you call me (you call me)
You call me (you call me), you call me (ah-ah)
(And I take it out to 'the day, Yeh)

Ey-yo ', the baby
He fell in love since I got it that first day
After me she didn't want
Now call me for me to give him
How do you see it '? The one who rules is me
I come, I spend it with that ass
Of such trust does not use 'condon
Do not drink anything other than pattern, skrt, skrt (Skrt, skrt!)
I am the one who calls when there is no na 'who does' (there is no na 'that makes')
For me, her jevo she doesn't see it anymore (he doesn't see it anymore)
I put it to baby 'Lean with Percecet (-Cocet)
When you feel alone (haha; and now you call me)
I always do it 'where she wants
I finished 'to do it and with me stay
Knows not and 'the only one and I don't complain
He turns back 'and his ass puts him on my face (Wuh)
While I put it to me, he tells me to get him before 'that she is la-, hah, haha
The baby

[Chorus: from the ghetto, Mark B & Archangel]
You call me
You call me, you call me
I do it to you to 'the day
You call me (uh)
You call me, you call me (ah)
And I take it out to 'the day (Austin, Baby, me')
[Verse 3: Archangel]
I want to wear it
'Tá more than say that I would like to do it
That's there I'm going to kiss you (Muah)
And if it's dry, I want to wet you
The boyfriend of yours
'It's more to say that I can break it
Attend it (AHA)
Take it for a walk and disappear it
I know you like when calling 'and I answer you (ah)
At any time you want 'and I don't bother me (Nope)
If you want ', I continue' the libretto (Yes)
Normal, I left it 'in secret (okay)
You know 'that I am discreet
Nobody tells him when I put it to you (woah)
And I continue the rumba, calm, that nobody tones me (no-no)
The bed floods when those buttocks rumble (Austin, Baby)
I am the one who wants to calm your cravings
With feeling, evil and elegance, ah

[Verse 4: Mark B]
I do it to you 'the way'
As you like, mommy, you will take it out
In bed or in the bathtub
Until you yell at me: "Daddy, I can no longer!"
I like how you hurt '
And puts me 'that face of fresh
Of my cure has' the recipe
So, come, to eat you complete

[Bridge: Mark B]
You only call me when you leave the disco
You call me if your boyfriend leaves you incomplete
You call me, tell him that the one I know is me
You call me, give it, mark my number

[Chorus: from the ghetto & bad bunny]
You call me
You call me, you call me
(And I do it to 'the day)
You call me (uh)
You call me, you call me
(And I take it out to 'the day)

[Verse 5: from the ghetto]
It climbs on top, there is no one who goes down
Does not want to take off until it ends
He likes Threesome ', he likes Molly
Also kissing with toa 'the' friend '
I touch it and the mojo (wuh), that red panty (wuh) quickly lowers
I put it pa'inentro until he makes his eye vi
He always likes to do it with me and that's why he looks for me
Even if I have a boyfriend, I am the best for her to spread
He doesn't ask questions'
Whenever it starts it does not want para-a-ar
He always calls me to return to Da-a-ar
