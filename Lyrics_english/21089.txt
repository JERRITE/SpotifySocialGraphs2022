Silent Running LyricsLyrics from live performance

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Stop, cause you're killing me
You brought me back and made me feel free
Rowdy waves and your energy
You brought me from the wreckage found within
I got so lost here
Machine assisted, I disappear
Into a dream, you don't wanna hear
How I got caught up in nowhere again
[Pre-Chorus: 2-D]
Hey!
It feels like I've been silent running
Through the infinite pages, I scroll out
Searching for a new world
The waste of the sunrise

[Chorus: 2-D]
I'm silent running
Run, run, running, run, run, running
Run, run, running, run, run, running (Back to you)
Run, run, running, run, run, running (Back to you)
I'm silent running
Run, run, running, run, run, running
Run, run, running, run, run, running

[Verse 2: 2-D & Adeleye Omotayo]
Stop, or you'll make me cry (Makе me cry)
I think it's time that I decidе (I decide)
What I've done when I trip and fly (Trip and fly)
The wave is taking me (Taking me)
Cause there's no way out of here (There's no way out)
In the labyrinth I disappear (No one here)
To the dark fleet that got me here (Underground)
How I got caught up in no where again

Hey!
It feels like I've been silent running
Through the infinite pages, I scroll out
Searching for a new world
The waste of the sunrise
I'm silent running

[Bridge: 2-D & Adeleye Omotayo]
Here we go
Searching for gold
You make me feel so alive (I'll never be)
Demons here (I'll never see)
That I had (I'll never sigh)
Truth be told (Too far to sigh)

[Chorus: 2-D & Adeleye Omotayo]
I'm silent running (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm silent running
Run, run, running, run, run, running (Ooh)
Run, run, running, run, run, running (Ooh)
Run, run, running, run, run, running (Back to you, back to you)
I'm silent running
Run, run, running, run, run, running
Run, run, running, run, run, running
[Outro: Adeleye Omotayo & 2-D]
I trip and fly (Trip and fly)
There's no one there (No one there)
There's no way out (No way out)
Trip and fly (Trip and fly)
'Cause I'm inside (Ooh, ooh)
Oh yeah3Embed
