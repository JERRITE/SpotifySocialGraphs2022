Brothers of Metal, Part 1 LyricsSlowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
Soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord,I summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
Hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take
My lustful soul
Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on
The horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll flyYou might also likeEmbed
