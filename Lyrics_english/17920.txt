What I told you [letter of "what I gave you"]

[Intro]
What I gave you
What I gave you, Woah, Woah

[Verse 1]
Nothing to do or say
I can't stop you anymore
Just remember what you're going to lose today
Nothing to talk about, that you are happy
If you can forget me
What we had will never find it
[Pre-car]
One day you are going to wake up
With nostalgia to skin flower
And you will remember again

[Chorus]
What I gave you, what I gave you
Follow inside your heart
I will always be the first time
What I gave you, what I gave you
It is the story of the purest love
I will always be the first time

[Post-car]
What I gave you
What I gave you, Woah, Woah

[Verse 2]
Forgive me if I'm not fine
There is any explanation
You are going to regret this goodbye very soon

[Saying]
Nothing to talk about, that you are happy
If you can forget me
What we had will never find it

One day you are going to wake up
With nostalgia to skin flower
And you will remember (remember)

[Chorus]
What I gave you, what I gave you
Follow inside your heart
I will always be the first time
What I gave you, what I gave you
It is the story of the purest love
I will always be the first time

[Bridge]
You have my name tied to your lips
And the caresses in my hands are still on your body
Sooner or later, you're going to miss me
You will then try to look for me and I will be very far
From the purest love, Woah-Woah

[Chorus]
What I gave you, what I gave you
Follow inside your heart
I will always be the first time
What I gave you, what I gave you
It is the story of the purest love (of the purest love, Woah-Woah)
I will always be the first time
[Post-car]
