TRANSMUTATION Lyrics[Chorus]
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind

[Verse 1]
To the ones that hold me down
I'm just grateful you're around
I'ma make 'em know this sound all for you
To the angels passed away
I'ma take this to the grave
And then meet me at the gates when I'm through
[Pre-Chorus]
We always see lightning before we hear thunder
But why does the wintеr feel longer than summer
And why is the timе getting faster and faster?
It's such a disaster, I know I won't last here

[Chorus]
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind

[Verse 2]
To the people of the world
To the boy without a girl
To the woman turned to widow in her room
To the doctors at the hospital
Who promise the impossible
Then rob you till you've got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
We always see lightning before we hear thunder
But why does the winter feel longer than summer
And why is the time getting faster and faster?
It's such a disaster, I know I won't last here
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mind
I'll act like I'm alright
Until the day that I die
I'll tell you one more time
Something 'bout you is haunting my mindEmbed
