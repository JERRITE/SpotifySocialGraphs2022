Intoxicao Lyrics [lyrics by "Intoxicao"]

[Intro]
Tell me what do you do 'pay them
That you don't want to pay them
Tell me what do you do 'pay them
No, you don't want to pay them

[Verse 1]
Intoxicao 'for power, I don't know
Who drives both, if I or him
A waste talent ', you see
But I still know this honey on my lips
I want to repeat, again
White and pure in my nose, again
Against your body without love, again
Don't tell me I shouldn't
[Chorus]
Tell me that you don't want to fuck like this, uh
Letting you wear
Tell me that you do not pay it like that, uh
Without knowing how much you spent
I wish I would never have convinced me
That I was born to win
I wish I would never have convinced me
That you are not from anyone else

[Verse 2]
I know that everything I have in good
I could kill me for money
I know that everyone who now follows my game
I want to have what I have
But I'm at my time, baby
I'm going to fuck you to kill my grief
I'm going to make this gift my sentence (Na-na)
Don't tell me I shouldn't

[Chorus]
Tell me that you don't want to fuck like this, uh
Letting you wear
Tell me that you do not pay it like that, uh
Without knowing how much you spent
I wish I would never have convinced me
That I was born to win
I wish I would never have convinced me
That you are not from anyone else

Brands of your nails on my skin
Multinationals in my cell
Hitting your face to the wall
I know you like this poison
Doing your year in just one month
Someone should stop my feet
I can only think about fucking and spending, this is not a game (EH)

[Verse 4]
Intoxicao 'for power, I don't know
Who drives both, if I or him
A waste talent ', you see
But I still know this honey on my lips
I want to repeat, again
White and pure in my nose, again
Against your body without love (huh!)
Don't tell me I shouldn't

[Chorus]
Tell me that you don't want to fuck like this, uh
Letting you wear
Tell me that you do not pay it like that, uh
Without knowing how much you spent
I wish I would never have convinced me
That I was born to win
I wish I would never have convinced me
That you are not from anyone else
[Verse 5]
I know that everything I have in good
I could kill me for money
I know that everyone who now follows my game
They want to have what I have
But I'm at my time, baby
I'm going to fuck you to kill my grief
I'm going to make this gift my conviction
Don't tell me I shouldn't

[Outro]
Uhm (no, no, no)
Uhm (no, no, no)
Uhm, uhm (no, no, no) 1embed
