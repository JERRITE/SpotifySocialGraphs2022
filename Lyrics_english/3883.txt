Family (Korea Version) Lyrics[Chorus: JAMIE & Ty Dolla $ign, JAMIE]
I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends

[Verse 1: JAMIE]
쉽다고는 못 하겠어 매번
의미 없이 쏟아지는 mention
다들 원해 뭔가를 내게서
그럴수록 주변은 더 챙겨
[Pre-Chorus: JAMIE]
지붕 아래 우린 private
창 밖의 소음 다 무시해
내 옆에 너만 that's all I care
난 겁이 없어

[Chorus: JAMIE, JAMIE and Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need
너와 나 that's what you'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Yeah) (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna know your real ones when you tested (Real)
Who there with you and they stand there when you're stressin' (Oh)
And if I do you wrong, I'ma 'fess it (Wrong)
Eh, good energy, gotta protect it

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bare feet on a fire walk, carry
You for miles until I crawl, trust me
Uh, tell me your secrets, they on lock, yeah (Lock, yeah)
I ain't alone on this one way

'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need
너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I need your energy, baby, don't need no friend or acquaintance
I need your love in a form that you won't give to nobody
Baby, I mean it, you taught me it was all, even inside of you
But I seen it, it's family over everything

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, I love too hard
I just want you to have your fun 'cause life is too short
Take you out to eat in New York, let's go to Jue Lan (Yeah)
Gon’ make and lose friends when your money too long

[Chorus: All, JAMIE, Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need
너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)
[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Huh, David Guetta, I told you they wouldn't — with us mayne
These glasses Celine, these Yeezy slidesEmbed
