TranslationsPortuguÃªsSearchlight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take one step and make it count
Hold your breath then let it out
What's left unsaid, say it loud
There's a fire in me
That's still burning

[Chorus]
I'm sending out a searchlight
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight
To bring you back to me
[Verse 2]
I'm lost again in this night
The sun just leads me into shadows
In my bones, in my blood
You cure my disease
Like a remedy

[Chorus]
I'm sending out a searchlight (Searchlight)
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life (To life)
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like (It's like)
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight
To bring you back to me

[Bridge]
Like a wild river
In a hurricane
Like a fallen empire
I will rise again
Take on step
And make it count

[Chorus]
I'm sending out a searchlight (Searchlight)
Shine it out until I find you, oh
Can you bring me back to life (To life)
When my heart's in smithereens
I wanna feel what it's like (It's like)
To be surrounded by you, oh
So I'm sending out a searchlight (Searchlight)
To bring you back to meYou might also like1Embed
