Bailo Sol Lyrics [verse 1]
No, I don't look like you
No, I'm not going to follow you
Who are you to judge
My way of climbing, my way of going down?
And who am I to doubt
Just because a fool wants me to change?
Ha! I don't need you

[Chorus]
I dance better when I dance alone
I move like this, breaking the waves
It's not me, it's you who complicates things
It's not me, it's you, don't tell me "liar"
[Verse 2]
You wanted to have me just to leave me
And then lock myself just to escape
Oh, look what chance
You get what I want and then leave
If everything paired badly
Why don't you open the door and leave me alone?
I do not need you

[Chorus]
I dance better when I dance alone
I move like this, breaking the waves
It's not me, it's you who complicates things
It's not me, it's you, don't tell me "liar"

[Bridge]
You don't need here, look, you don't need here
Hey Hey hey!
I'm fine like that, look, I'm fine without you
Hey Hey hey!
I want to dance alone, I dance alone
I dance alone
I want to dance alone, I dance alone
I dance alone

[Outro]
I dance better when I dance alone
I dance better when you dance
