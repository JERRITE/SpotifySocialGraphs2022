THE GLORY OF GOD LYRICS [LETTER OF "THE GLORY OF GOD"] 

 The glory of God, manages my life 
 With love threads that put in my soul 
 Takes me to him 
 The glory of God, giant and sacred 
 He loads me in his arms, encourages my steps 
 Fill me with peace and honey 
 He goes out to play when he comes to see me and lets me win 

 From the glory of God I will have, the rest for my feet 
 With his mantle my cold will disappear and rest 
 From the glory of God will come, blessing and abundant bread 
 For you for me and whoever wants to come to the glory of God 
 Of glory 

 From the glory of God will come, blessing and abundant bread 
 For you for me and whoever wants to come to the glory of God 
 For you for me and whoever wants to come to the glory of God 

 In the glory of God (in the glory of God) 
 Abundant bread
