Turn on another lyrics we see when the sun falls
When the night is cold
We two wrapped in alcohol
A feeling I turned on because you are lit

Look what I tell you, Tate Attentive
In the wallet there is another wrapped and a mint
If you want we do it in the car, close the door
But let's practice without respect

Turn another and go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy, if we eat
Turn another and go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy, if we eat

LET ANOTHER AND WE WILL PAL HOTEL
Encapsulated with smoke and accelerate car
I serve a Jagger shot, I'm your waiter
Now I let you get wet like a downpour
If we had a connection from the zero minute

If you put conditions not my matter
But if I kiss you is pa â€™that corresponds (no no no)
Nor do you beg you to be together
Everything in life has its pro and against

You don't have to be boyfriends to eat
Just tell me mommy where you and I are going
If it is for me I buy you or ferragamo
And if you want again I call you

I can't give you what you deserve
But if I can give you hard in the dark
That today is in front of you is no accident

Turn another and go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy
If we eat
You Might Also Likeprende another and let's go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy
If we eat

We are young for commitments
But you are already big to ask permission
He has 21 and gave him on the tenth floor
That the note uploads to the Manuel Turizo huh

We enter the fourth furisa
He took off his shirt
I gave him without protection
Like a plane lands
Toa the skin brings
I take out the one who laughs
It is not necessary for a plan B
When something is improvised, huh

I can't give you what you deserve
But if I can give you hard in the dark
That today is in front of you is no accident

Turn another and go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy
If we eat
Turn another and go for the hotel
That, in reality, we do not know each other
That we wasting time would be stupid
When we are going to enjoy
If we eat ourselves
