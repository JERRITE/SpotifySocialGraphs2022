Soul Ties Lyrics(Ain't taking nothing from you, but you took a lot from me)

Sitting here staring at your picture with a slight grin
Even though you hate me I know you’ll let me fuck again
Them Soul Ties Got You Stuck Again
And I ain’t never been in love
But I swear to god I wanna love again
Serious Issues do you need some tissues
You hate talking to the only nigga that can fix you
You Say, "I got some growing up to do, I just wanna fuck with you"
Feeling like I’m stuck with you won’t toot your horn or blow your flute
Them rainy Nights Can turn into some sunny days
Random sex can temporarily take this pain away
Major Nine to these hoes but you call me bae
And that’s only when you fucking with me
Tell me if you fucking with me
Pussy that ain’t nothing to me
I just need some help
We be focused on everybody and everything but our self
You so hurt and you don’t know how to love
And you don’t give a fuck
But self-respect won’t let you, let just any nigga fuck
I’m mad I feel like turning up fuck the world without a glove
Room full of demons I’m still fighting I ain’t giving up
Tell me if this real enough and look me in my eyes
Even though Ion know what I’m doing damn at least a nigga tried
And I ain’t never tell you lies I’m too G for that
Them Soul Ties will leave you heartless ain’t no keeping that
And I ain’t never tell you lies I’m too G for that them Soul Ties
Will leave you heartless ain’t no keeping that

That’s why I'm
Sitting here staring at them pictures with a slight grin
