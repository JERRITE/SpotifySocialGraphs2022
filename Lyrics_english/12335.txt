My Funeral Lyrics[Intro]
At the end of this long and lonely path
All misery will be gone

[Verse 1]
Down this long and twining road
I walk with heavy feet, my head sunk down below
I have made up my mind
It's time to end this life, then peace I will find

[Chorus]
Walking down to my funeral, the mortal sin
Some might be sad, I'll die with a grin
Walking down to my funeral, it's time to die
When I leave this pathetic world I will hold my head high
[Bridge]
Angels are watching from above
As so does the evil ones that lurks down below
I am almost there
At my funeral

[Verse 2]
I reach the end of twining road
I put a bullet in my gun, don't need to reload
Feel the cold steel to my head
Time to pull the trigger, soon I'll be dead

[Chorus]
Now when I'm at my funeral I feel so free
Some might be sad, I'll die with a grin
Now when I'm at my funeral I feel so free
The mortal sin (Sin, sin, sin, sin, sin)

[Bridge]
Angels and demons
Reach out for me
Kingdom's wide open
I walk away from thee!
As I walk away
Eternal in twilight I dwell
You might also like[Chorus]
Walking down to my funeral, the mortal sin
Some might be sad, I'll die with a grin
Walking down to my funeral, it's time to die
When I leave this pathetic world I will hold my head high
Hold my head high!2Embed
