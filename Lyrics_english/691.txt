Hey Chanty Lyrics ["Hey Chanty" letter]]

[Chorus]
Hey, Chanty, what does it do '?
Two in the morning, she is online
Vamo 'A Verno', what do you think '?
Smoking 'and pedimo' food
It is not 'malita,' toy of course that you ere 'a dog
Like up and shouts for me

[Post-car]
He tells me that he hangs her and that she is scipped
That if I'm coming it is in my mouth
I get my diablita tongue
And I come, and I put the 'wife' (-osa ')
Galleto and that excites
He despairs, wants me to break it
And I donqueo like Jordan
From Zaza, we fell an ounce, a round of round '
[Verse]
My chukynunni, who is not afraid of the 'poli
Smokeing up for the story (-Sto-Tory)
Fan of how the madman puts it (puts)
Of such trust no longer use 'it' condone '
Today 'TÃ¡ in heat, he doesn't want to use his vibrator
He spends porn by imagining that I give him
When he stays to sleep, I do it from a time
And I know how to make that little bit drene (that totito drene)

[Pre-car]
Bring me that culote (-Let)
For putting it 'on my face (face; uh-uh)
To vert it to me (for)
And if you shout, I come (I come)
So nice 'Those eye' snathea ', that note goes to' putona
With wins' of synoge now
(What did you tell me? Can I change me? Heh)

[Chorus]
Hey, Chanty, what does it do '?
Two in the morning, she is online
Vamo 'A Verno', what do you think '?
Smoking 'and pedimo' food
It is not 'malita,' toy of course that you ere 'a dog
Like up and shouts for me
