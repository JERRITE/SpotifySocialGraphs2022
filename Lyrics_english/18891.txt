Hellraiser (30th Anniversary Edition) Lyrics[Song lyrics for ''Hellraiser'']

[Verse 1: Ozzy Osbourne & Lemmy Kilmister]
I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ozzy Osbourne]
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire
[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Lemmy Kilmister]
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

[Verse 2: Lemmy Kilmister & Ozzy Osbourne]
Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight
People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't make it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Lemmy Kilmister]
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

[Bridge: Ozzy Osbourne]
Hellraiser, yeah
Hellraiser

[Pre-Chorus 3: Ozzy Osbourne]
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Lemmy Kilmister]
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you1Embed
