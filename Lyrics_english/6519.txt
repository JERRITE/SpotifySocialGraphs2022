Marijuana Breath Lyrics[Verse 1]
I tried to tell you a hundred times
Love can kill you and make you cry
I'm not the monster under your bed
I'm just the voices inside your head

[Pre-Chorus]
Somedays we may go our separate ways, oh
These drugs they get the best of me
Rolling torches underneath the table
These drugs will be the death of me
[Chorus]
So kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget

So kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget

[Verse 2]
It's human nature, it's in our bones
Cause no one wants to be all alone
I'm the darkness behind your eyes
Killing brain cells and killing time

[Pre-Chorus]
Somedays we may go our separate ways, oh
These drugs they get the best of me
Rolling torches underneath the table
These drugs will be the death of me

[Chorus]
So kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget
You might also likeSo kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget
(Kiss me with your marijuana breath)

So kiss me with your marijuana breath
I can be your cure for loneliness
A little something to help you forget
(Kiss me with your marijuana breath)
(Kiss me with your marijuana breath)2Embed
