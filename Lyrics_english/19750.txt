The Thrill Lyrics[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit
I get done with one, and move right on to another bitch (Ha)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, college-educated, she graduated
Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it
The show was far, you the only one with a car
And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chase it
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it
Value player, hotel room, meet you there
[Bridge: Empire of the Sun & Wiz Khalifa]
Walking on a dream
How can I explain
Talking to myself (Just travellin' the world)
Will I see again? (Trying different drugs and girls)

[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Wiz Khalifa]
(Yeah) We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne (Champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (Whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (Planes at)
Yeah, uhh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up drunk, go to sleep fucked up (Fucked up)
We both amazed at what we just done (Just done)
Mixing drinks, knowing we'll regret this (Regret this)
Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringing us breakfast (Breakfast)
All this money, darling, what else is left to do
But smoke and enjoy my presidential view
Got a swimming pool in my livin' room
On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume (Let's consume)

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it (Yeah)
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it (Bitch, okay)
On and on and on we are calling out and out again (Yeah, yeah)
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne (Champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (Whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne (Champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (Whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (Planes at)

[Bridge 2: Empire of the Sun & Wiz Khalifa]
Catch me, I'm fallin' down (Yeah, that's what it is)
Catch me, I'm fallin' down (Until I drop the next one)

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne (Champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (Whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at
[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm addicted to champagne (Champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (Whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (Planes at)
