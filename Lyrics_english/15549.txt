You didn't want

[Verse 1]
Aha, you don't want to hurt me
Aha, which was not your intention
That you never imagined that we would arrive until today
That it is better to finish everything so that you do not suffer your love

[Pre-car]
You would have thought about when you looked at me with that smile that made me tremble
And before saying the phrase that made me feel that I was something special
Before with your sweater you would remove the cold from my loneliness
Before stealing a kiss and turning on my body and not being able to stop
You didn't want to hurt me
You didn't want to hurt me
You wanted to kill me!

[Chorus]
You say that now
I'm still on time, I can escape
What are you going to release my hand
So that I run towards my freedom

Tell me who gave you the right
To take you to want to save me
You can't do more damage
And if I'm with you, I want to be

[Post-car]
You didn't want to hurt me
You didn't want to hurt me
You wanted to kill me

[Verse 2]
Aha, it's not because you don't love me
Aj√°, I deserve something wicked-or
And you prefer to leave before
To break my heart

You would have thought about when you caught me on the four walls of your room
When you went down my defenses and made me fragile with that song
Before closing the door and leaving me nervous and breathless
Before entering my dreams and changing my direction towards your direction

You didn't want to hurt me
You didn't want to hurt me
You wanted to kill me!

[Chorus]
You say that now
I'm still on time, I can escape
What are you going to release my hand
So that I run towards my freedom

Tell me who gave you the right
To take you to want to save me
You can't do more damage
And if I'm with you, I want to be

[Outro]
You didn't want to hurt me
Oh, you didn't want to hurt me
You wanted to kill me!
You didn't want to hurt me
You didn't want to hurt me
You wanted to kill me
