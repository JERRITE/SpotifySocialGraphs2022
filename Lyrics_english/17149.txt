Bout Shit Lyrics[Intro: DMX & Styles P]
(Scram Jones, Scram Jones)
Grrrr
LOX shit, nigga
Livin' off Xperience
You feel it in the air, don't you?
Yeah, ha

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Steppin' out the Benz with the shearling that Bane had
Before you test me, you ought to think of your brainpan
Donnie's a gorilla, Al-Qaeda came with the killers
Gun on the weight while I wait for niggas
Plate full of plants
If you wanna die, y'all know the devil, go ahead and pick the date for the dance (Go ahead)
I'm in the i8, blow an 8th on the iPhone
On a money call, then take the advancе (Uh-uh)
Fifty-fifty split, take mines on the back еnd
Business going good, take the profit, put it back in (Put it back in)
Reganomics in effect (Yeah), rooftops with cartels, honoring the set (E-block)
My outfit, put you out kid
Fuck about the plug 'cause we the outlet (We the outlet)
Yardie homie got a TEC, and he on that stoute shit (Damn)
Latin homie got the coke and he on that route shit
[Chorus: DMX]
You ain't really 'bout shit
We let the dogs out
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Blam, blam, you in the Lord's house
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Y-O nigga, we goin' all out
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Find you a shelter, we gon' fall out
Man, come on, come on

[Verse 2: DMX]
They call me the microwave 'cause I hit 'em with hot shit, quick (Damn)
Got the streets like, damn this LOX shit sick (Ooh)
We ain't playin' with you niggas
In the trunk I got them things that I'm sprayin' at you niggas (What?)
Think something funny? Y'all keep laughin'
Nigga already dead, I'ma keep stabbing (Ugh)
Been a loose cannon, been puttin' work in (Yeah)
Name ringing bells, from School Street to Warburton (Woo)
Niggas talk about battle, but they ain't battle dog (Nah)
My rap sheet is longer than niggas catalogs (What?)
Fuck you battle for? (Ugh), you know you ain't winnin' (Uh-uh)
X been the grim reaper since the beginning' (Okay)
These new rappers got me like, "What the fuck is you doin'?"
You all over the place with it, what the fuck is you doin'?
If you ain't spittin' the truth, then the shut the fuck up (Please)
Fuck you, suck my dick, now what

You ain't really 'bout shit
We let the dogs out
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Blam, blam, you in the Lord's house (Woo, yeah)
Man, come on (Scram, you a fool for this one)
You ain't really 'bout shit
Y-O nigga, we goin' all out
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Find you a shelter, we gon' fall out (Ay yo, we [?] ready or what?)
Man, come on, come on (Ay yo, [?] will you talk to these niggas?)
(Time to mop these out)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
All this fake love around here, I know how it feel
You could just say, "What's up?" I could tell it ain't real
Nigga came home from somewhere, I could tell it ain't jail
No music, got a hunnid thousand large in the mail
Can't tell them all your plans 'cause they want you to fail
Nigga hate when you be movin', they rather you still (Haha)
Keep track of me (Facts), watch the back of me (Facts)
I pop up more than my son's acne (Yeah)
Cut 'em into pieces, body in the freezers
I don't drink Lean, so I don't be catchin' seizures (Nah, haha)
With the cheese, I'm like Lil' Caesars (Woo)
Fuck your debit card, and your lil' visas (Oh)
Coke game, dope game, niggas been around that (Oh)
Shot dead, left at your bitch house, you get found at (Oh)
Trap game, rap game, niggas made hits (Huh, hits)
LOX, D-Block, get off our dicks, ah
[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Pretty much are who we are now (L-O-X)
We shed light on a city with a dark cloud (Y-O)
We brought Diddy through, even bought the R's out (Yeah)
In a lot with the trucks and the cars out (Hmm)
And we never said once, if it wasn't for us (Uh-uh)
Hindsight, I look back, it just wasn't enough (Nah)
The fake love got exposed, just wasn't the lust (Uh-uh)
You find out who's who, you seek others to trust (Woo)
It was already bars (Yeah), we was already stars (Yeah)
Couldn't make us more related than we already are (Nah)
It was written already, meaning it was already God
And we came from the bottom so it was already hard
Now, I smoke different, I drink different, I think different (Yes)
My contract is much bigger, so the ink's different
My outlet, not about my outfit (Fuck)
How you feel about shit? You ain't really bout shit, nigga

[Chorus: DMX & Jadakiss]
You ain't really 'bout shit (Yeah)
We let the dogs out (L-O-X)
Man, come on (Scram Jones)
You ain't really 'bout shit
Blam, blam, you in the Lord's house
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Y-O nigga, we goin' all out
Man, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit
Find you a shelter, we gon' fall out
Man, come on, come on
You ain't really 'bout shit2Embed
