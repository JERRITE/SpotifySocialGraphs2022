JOKER, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
We are, tonight's entertainment
(Perfect!)
D fucking Savage

[Chorus]
All of this money, don't know what to do
I bought some guns for my motherfuckin' crew
She for the squad, call it switcheroo
I get in that pussy and do what I do
I drop the top on that Off-White coupe
I spend a band on some motherfuckin' kicks
I spend a band on some motherfuckin' shoes
Fuckin' with mine, put him on the news
I'm in my prime and I can't lose
I pour out the pint 'til my body get loose
I play with that paper, my bitch do too
She suck on my dick likе she missing a tooth
I'd rather be dеad then fuckin' with you
When I'm out in Bompton, I be with Pirus
I jump in these streets, and I'm breakin' the rules
[Verse]
He in a stretcher, I'm leaving him flat
I'm hearing voices, I'm talkin' to Jack
Hit her one time, she keep calling back
If they outside, then we doubling back
Play with the gang, and that choppa gon' clap
In the mafia, baby, I'm getting them wacked (Ah)
I wanna see that shit drop to the floor
She wanna fuck and then smoke on my dope
Like, "Baby, I'm done, it's your time to go"
Fuck up that Wockhardt, I just poured a four
Niggas be goofies, you know how that go
I wanna get my dick sucked on a boat
I wanna get a two litre and pour
And I got Christian Dior on my coat
I got some Bloodys, and I got some Locs
I know some BDs, and I know some Folks

[Chorus]
All of this money, don't know what to do
I bought some guns for my motherfuckin' crew
She for the squad, call it switcheroo
I get in that pussy and do what I do
I drop the top on that Off-White coupe
I spend a band on some motherfuckin' kicks
I spend a band on some motherfuckin' shoes
Fuckin' with mine, put him on the news
I'm in my prime and I can't lose
I pour out the pint 'til my body get loose
I play with that paper, my bitch do too
She suck on my dick like she missing a tooth
I'd rather be dead then fuckin' with you
When I'm out in Bompton, I be with Pirus
I jump in these streets, and I'm breakin' the rules

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Yeah, that's itEmbed
