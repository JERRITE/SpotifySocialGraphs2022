THE LYRICS STRATEGY [LETTER OF "THE STRATEGY"]

[Verse 1: the dandee]
I know that it is never good to appear, that I should not call it
That it must seem that I am fine, that I could already forget it
The same I know that it was your decision and I must respect it
And I must suppress this hope of loving her again
If I do everything good, maybe one day I will get me to cry
And it's not that I want me to suffer, I want me not to ignore me
And although I did it without guilt, my fears won, eh-eh
If I do everything well maybe one day come back and fall in love
[Bridge: Cali]
Do everything without errors to see if you captive you
And look for the perfect excuse, so you know that I still live
And to make that call that shows that I still exist
The strategy is the least, I just want to hear your voice

[Chorus: Cali & El Dandee]
I don't want to keep playing, uoh
To be my friends who decide what I do
I'm drowning
By swallowing the words, and not saying that I miss you
And not say that I love you

[Verse 2: Cali]
Your departure hurts so much that I beg for anesthesia
A heart is bleed while yours has amnesia
Do not remember that night that we swore to be eternal
That we were going to give everything to love us
That parallel universe in which you still love me
It is the cure at times that it hurts so much
The abandonment hurts so much, I gave you everything you have
And the more love I give you the more you close it and you hurt me

[Chorus: Cali & El Dandee]
I don't want to keep playing, uoh
To be my friends who decide what I do
I'm drowning
By swallowing the words, and not saying that I miss you
And not say that I love you

They told me that you forgot me and that you are no longer sad
That there is another and that you no longer care what for me one day you felt
And I do not lose hope and dream that you lied to them, eh-eh
And that you use the same strategy that I used when you left

[Chorus: Cali & El Dandee]
I don't want to keep playing, uoh
To be my friends who decide what I do
I'm drowning
By swallowing the words, and not saying that I miss you
And not say that I love you2embed
