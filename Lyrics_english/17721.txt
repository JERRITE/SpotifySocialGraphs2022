Next Up - S4-E2, Pt. 1 Lyrics[Intro]
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
J, Ay, Yo, Yo

[Chorus]
They try claim that they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski' back, whatever the situation gimme' time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake
[Verse]
I can't live a normal life no more
This shit got me wishin' I hid my face
I ain't been gеtting no sleep on a regular
Think it's because of thе money I chase
Gotta make sure that everyone eats
Need to put food on my families' plate
When bro shoulda been in school
He was puttin' numbers in a shape
Yo, I put all of my heart into passion
I said I would blow, but they were tellin' me "No"
I'm guessing, they must have been cappin'
Bae been upset that I ain't been present
'Cah I been focusin' on the rappin'
But I need to leave the hood soon 'cause the block too hot like tuna
Gotta get bread, no room to be slappin'
Yo, so many sleepless nights
Grind don't stop till the whole gang eatin' right
You weren't there when I had no cake, but you're thinkin' of gettin' a slice
Ever since I been handle with fame, I been duckin' from evil eye
And them girls that were movin' tight
Told them that there's been a change in price

[Chorus]
They try claim that they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski' back, whatever the situation gimme' time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake
They try claim that they had my back
Them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski' back, whatever the situation gimme' time and place
I been working on trust and again
They don't know about the time it takes
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like—You might also like1Embed
