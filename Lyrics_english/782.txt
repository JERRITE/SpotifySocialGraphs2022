Baby Girl Lyrics [lyrics by "Baby Girl"]

[Intro: Mario Bautista & Lalo Ebratt]
Is that with your skin you wrap me (prr, prr)
You wrap me as a snake (skrrt)
Poison that does not kill me
Poison that makes me strong (prr, prr)

[Pre-car: Lalo Ebratt]
Oh, baby
Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me
I boil if you touch me
Hit your mouth
Oh, give it
Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me (prr, prr)
You know I have you crazy, crazy
[Chorus: Mario Bautista]
Merde me again and again, again and again
I want to try you too, Yeah
Give it, remove stress
Be what you want to be
Be a Barbie Girl

[Verse 1: Lalo Ebratt]
By your sea you have me sailing (PRR)
Your name I put it to my ship (Skrrt, Skrrt)
I was waiting for you
You know where and know 'When (You Know, It Baby)
And tell me what you want with me
As I want with you (haha)
I don't know why I like you so much
I don't know why I like you so much (prr, prr)

[Verse 2: Lalo Ebratt]
They all give them very heavy (pshh, pshh)
All skates are Penny, ha
Red in your eyes looks good (so good)
Tell your friends to spend more than one hundred (Yeah, Damn)
I KISSED TO GIRL, I LIKED IT (SO GOOD)
How good you look, Versace
I KISSED to Girl, I Liked It (Another One)
I KISSED TO GIRL

Sorry for the delay, we had lost ourselves in time
To another universe, in 2030 and Pico

We are staying with the whole party and all the baby girls, haha
