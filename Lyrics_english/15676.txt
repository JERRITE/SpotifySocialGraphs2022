I fell in love with you Lyrics ["I fell in love with you"]

[Pre-car]
I want you to be mine and never anyone (baby, baby)
If I continue in your life, it was to stay (you know ')
A true love is never shared
I promise to give you everything and that nothing is missing

[Chorus]
I fell in love with you, your figure, your face
And I don't know what to do, I'm going to go crazy
Tell me if I continue here, if I deliver everything I have
Or I leave here and you run out of me
[Post-car]
I fell in love with you (OH-OH-OH)
I don't know if you (ri-rri-rri-righ)
Tell me if I'm still here
Fighting to see if something makes you feel

[Verse 1]
CONTER ME THE PHONE, MAMI, Don't say no
Look that I'm alone and I miss you in my room
I know you still listen to adventure
And what I feel for you is no obsession

[Bridge]
Hey, mommy, wait for me at the door
I'm going to pick you up, I hope you're willing
Hey, mommy, wait for me at the door
That I came to pick you up, tell me what it costs you

[Chorus]
I fell in love with you, your figure, your face
And I don't know what to do, I'm going to go crazy
Tell me if I continue here, if I deliver everything I have
Or I leave here and you run out of me

[Post-car]
I fell in love with you (OH-OH-OH)
I don't know if you (ri-rri-rri-righ)
Tell me if I'm still here
Fighting to see if something makes you feel

(I fell in love with you, I don't know if you)
Yao ', Baby, Mamacita
(Tell me if I keep fighting here to see if something makes you feel)

From Maluma, Ba-Ba-Baby
Muah, hahahaembed
