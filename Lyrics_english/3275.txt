Panda (Luca Lush Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

[Chorus]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 look like a panda
Goin' out like I’m Montana
Hundred killas, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Sellin’ bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Panda, Panda, Panda
[Drop]
Panda
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Panda

[Chorus]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 look like a panda
Goin' out like I’m Montana
Panda, Panda, Panda

Hey, hey, hey, hey
