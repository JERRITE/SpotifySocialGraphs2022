Someone I like lyrics ["I like someone's lyrics" ft. Jessi Uribe & Jhonny Rivera]

[Intro: Andy Rivera & Jessi Uribe]
I like someone, but I can't tell him
It has a built life that I cannot destroy
I would like to tell him, that ignoring it was impossible
And it hurts that without being able to have it, you have to say goodbye

[Pre-Coro: Jhonny Rivera, Andy Rivera]
I know a thousand ways to fall in love
But what I feel I have to keep
And consciousness prevents me from approaching, Yeah-Yeah, EH-EH
When I'm drunk it gives me a feeling
That if I call you you will come running
With one more glass I would dare to call
[Choir: Jessi Uribe & Andy Rivera]
And if you come, I don't answer, no -uoh
Pass me the bottle and I drink it to the bottom
And if you come, I don't answer, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
Serve me another bottle, I take it to the bottom

[Post-car: Jessi Uribe]
And when there is no more cup
I'm going to say what I never told you
Although with another you committed, for me there is no
In my mind you are mine and anyone else

[Interlude: Jessi Uribe]
Jhonny Rivera and Andy Rivera
Repeat it
Rafa!
Faith
What?

[Pre-Coro: Jhonny Rivera, Jessi Uribe & Andy Rivera]
I know a thousand ways to fall in love
But what I feel I have to keep
And consciousness prevents me from approaching, Yeah-Yeah, EH-EH
When I'm drunk it gives me a feeling
That if I call you you will come running
With one more glass I would dare to call
