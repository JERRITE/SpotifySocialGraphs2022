Save Me from Myself Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to the voices in my head
They misbehave with every chance they get
The pain is real, my laughter is pretend
So I light the matches, ready to forget

[Pre-Chorus]
And I spark up the fire
And things feel a bit brighter
But not quite how I like it
So I get a bit higher
[Chorus]
So won't you save me from myself right now
'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now
So won't you save me from myself right now, right now
'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow

[Verse 2]
Still it's 48 hours without rest
Burning sensation in my chest
Never would admit that I'm depressed
'Cause I was raised to take the bitter with a twist

[Pre-Chorus]
So I spark up the fire
And things feel a bit brighter
But not quite how I like it
So I get a bit higher

[Chorus]
So won't you save me from myself right now, right now
'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now
So won't you save me from myself right now, right now
'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow, somehow

[Bridge]
'Cause I miss myself, yeah I miss myself, have you seen me
Yeah I miss that man that I was back then, have you see him
'Cause I miss myself, yeah I miss myself, have you seen me
Yeah I miss that man that I was back then, have you see him
You might also like[Chorus]
So won't you save me from myself right now
'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now
Won't you save me from myself right now, right now
'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow, somehow3Embed
