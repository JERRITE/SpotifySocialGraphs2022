Where no one can go lyrics [letter from "where nobody can go"]

Looking in the stars I found
Eyes as bright as nothing you know
Beyond the sun
Because you're so beautiful
More than heaven and stars
You are what was missing and I always wanted it to be
You are the only one that puts me to dance
Who puts me to sweat
The only one that makes my head walk
The heart to beaten
In a pleasant way
For your unsuspected smile
I would like to tear off your skin
Like a piece of paper
I would like to kiss you again
From head to toe
I want to wake up with you
Be your pillow and be your coat
And whenever you want
When you want it
I'm going to be with you
Hidden until the end
Together
Where no one can go
You are the only one that puts me to dance
Who puts me to sweat
The only one that puts my head to walk
The heart to beaten
In a pleasant way
For your unsuspected smile
I would like to tear off your skin
Like a piece of paper
I would like to kiss you again
From head to toe
I want to wake up with you
Be your pillow and be your coat
And whenever you want
When you want it
I'm going to be with you
Hidden until the end
Together
