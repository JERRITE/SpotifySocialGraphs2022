One Thing Right (Firebeatz Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've cheated and I've lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door
[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right

[Pre-Drop]
One thing, one thing right
One thing, I got one thing right
One thing, one thing right
One thing, I got one thing right
One thing, you, One thing right
One thing, I got one thing right
Thing right, thing right, thing right, thing right
Thing right, thing right, I got one thing right

[Drop]
I got you
I got you
One thing, you, one thing right
One thing (Thing), I got one thing right
One thing, you, one thing right
One thing, I got one thing right
You might also like[Verse 2]
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right

[Pre-Drop]
I got one thing right

[Drop]
One thing, one thing right, you
One thing, thing, I got one thing right
One thing, you, one thing right
One thing, thing, I got one thing right
One thing, you, one thing right
One thing (Thing), I got one thing right
One thing (You), one thing right
One thing, I got one thing rightEmbed
