Translations Franiseni√®re Danse Lyrics [Lyrics of "Last Dance"]

[Verse 1]
O my sweet suffering
Why go on? You come back
I am only an unimportant being
Without him, I am a little paro
I wander alone in the metro
One last dance
To forget my huge pain
I want to run out that everything is coming to
O my sweet suffering
[Chorus]
I assess the sky, day, night
I dance with the wind, the rain
A little love, a bit of honey
And I dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And in the noise, I run and I'm afraid
Is this my turn? Comes back pain
In all of Paris, I surrender
And I fly away, flies, flies, flies, flies, flies, flies

[Verse 2]
What hope
On this path in your absence
I may have trime, without you my life is only a decor that shines, empty of meaning

[Chorus]
I assess the sky, day, night
I dance with the wind, the rain
A little love, a bit of honey
And I dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And in the noise, I run and I'm afraid
Is this my turn? Comes back pain
In all of Paris, I surrender
And I fly away, flies, flies, flies, flies, flies, flies

[Verse 3]
In this sweet suffering
Of which I paid all the offenses
Listen like my heart is huge
I am a child of the world
You might also like [refrain]
I assess the sky, day, night
I dance with the wind, the rain
A little love, a bit of honey
And I dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
And in the noise, I run and I'm afraid
Is this my turn? Comes back pain
In all of Paris, I surrender
And I fly away, flies, flies, flies, flies, flies, steals12embedd
