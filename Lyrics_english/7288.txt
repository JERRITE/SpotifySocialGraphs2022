Wild Bandana Lyrics [Text by "Wild Bandana" Ft. Tedua & Vaz tea]

[Intro: Izi & Tedua]
Eh hey, yah
Eh hey, yah
Hey
No, so much ..
I remember everything, Seh
And I remember, eh
You Tedua?
You vaz?
Wild Bandana, Tedua, Yah
C o g o
Yah, Yah, Yah
[Verse 1: Tedua]
When I started, I was suspended
I hated any spoiled torture
I wanted to rap my exits of jail
From the popular, but the crack changed the plans
Memories Izi arrested with the buffi on the shoulders
And the balls of not singing
As I was able
And Mundu moved from Cogo to Grateful
He wore chocolate kappa
I remember Rave when he was in the garage
Then vaz tea, consciousness of the classic intellectual honesty
The thickness between blocking and blocking of the writer
In the amount of rhymes in Montale
Until blood had lost its flow
It was a menstrual from the houses of the municipality
Above Voltri among the cocci di coca
And Caran d'Ache Ocher color
Still little consciousness
The first live souvenir brawls in Are, Cogo, with Bolzaneto
Galletto screamed: "dug the pit alone"
But an hour later stavam drinking together
In the back you could not spread ignorance
When walls was in four walls
And we sang before his mom
Meanwhile, respect was learned
To make road rap

I know what is best for me
I just don't do it
I have no money, yes, but for now
You will see, sooner or later I do them
I bought books at the book
I just want a ransom
For me and my gang
We smoke on the beach
Pour the Fanta with the ice

[Refrain: Izi]
And shouts
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
And shout wild bandana
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, cries Wild Bandana

[Verse 2: vaz tea]
It was the spring of rap e
Genoa was full of Nader
I did the first from Demo for R Key
In the end, for Diego they spread the red carpet
Music is an excellent lover
Or a bad partner
Sarah Jessica Parker
If for this two bombs I put it aside
Look there the bandana
From the first bridges skipped in the air
All skilled jobs, my friar 'has
Feat with the accounts welded on the street
Taken well that they have not captured
Genoese as in the songwriter
Then he stops all my cocks
Paradise what mine deserve
I do this and so
That you want to know of who, of whom
You want only one feat
Hear you say yes
We win because we have not divided ourselves
I'm still with Mario in the New Izi
Edited by Diablo
It is the day of karma
And, among ', we give him a gift
[Pre-Crime: Izi]
I know what is best for me
I just don't do it
I have no money, yes, but for now
You will see, sooner or later I do them
I bought books at the book
I just want a ransom
For me and my gang
We smoke on the beach
Pour the Fanta with the ice

[Refrain: Izi]
And shouts
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, Oh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Scream wild bandana, wild bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, Oh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, cries Wild Bandana

[Verse 3: izi]
I brought the sheets to Duate on Al Campetto
Yes, in search of respect
I was about sixteen, a more or less dwarf
I wait for the train to Cogoleto above the third
Which still scrutinizes for the controller "You are without a ticket"
I know vaz tea around the squares
From the center to the outskirts I am in tune with a thousand races
I misfigred the girls because I felt ugly
I started with the rods because I needed a dip
The first tape with blood and dirty roots
Stains, scars, in cream with friends
I stole my bikes to go home
At home with my mother and my sister he quarreled
I was isolated for dinner, I tried at school
And the study was my time
Always inside with hot temples
I was working in the stable to stay happy
And I swallowed bales like hay to stay peaceful, like time
That with passing I felt more well
And I try to leave, but then I always fall
Strip like snakes, I have nothing to do with it
That I met Rave when he already saw bad
When two reeds at the park separated the roads
The chester in the package and ten grams on the ball
That yellow face that "I recommend, eat"
I recommend mom, I recommend with mine
I am not forty like the DSA
The shit that are eaten in meals, between '
I have no degree, but I'm a doctor
Giro rods, I go around the world like the equator
I do this and I do that because I have no limits
I put the judgments aside
They are the chills that I feel they throw me forward
I made war for a lot, packed with the gloves
I made war on a fuck, now we are on condition of arms
That I don't know if I am or if I have to escape
Or if maybe I have to pay duties

[Pre-Crime: Izi]
I know what is best for me
I just don't do it
I have no money, yes, but for now
You will see, sooner or later I do them
I bought books at the book
I just want a ransom
For me and my gang
We smoke on the beach
Pour the Fanta with the ice

[Refrain: Izi]
And shouts
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Scream wild bandana, wild bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, Oh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, cries wild bandana14embed
