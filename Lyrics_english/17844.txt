Palm Angels Lyrics [Song text for "Palm Angels"]

[Intro]
(The Beat is like Water)
(Cato)
Water, Keep That One!
Drip Baby, Yee

[Hook]
Okay, Palm Angels
Feelings of happiness, I see flavi in ​​a Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, I came as a forent
White gold chain, stones clear as Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, Nigga, that's The Wrong Way
Feelings of happiness, I see Flavi in ​​Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, came as a forent
White gold chain, stones like Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, nigga, that's wrong way (ye)
[Part 1]
Palm Angel's Track Suit, almost a K (almost a K)
Body and head clean, ya, I did it
It was nice, but I think back, it was much too hard (way too hard)
Everyone says he knows that, no, that 'not the (no, not that)
The angels up there, they sing for me in the choir (they sing in the choir)
The sky reminds me of the Cartier Store (Cartier Store)
His last word was: "Mufasa, you fur off" (you fur off)
I wouldn't be what I am, I would still be in Düsseldorf (in Düsseldorf)
Paying asses like Play-Doh
I haven't had a payphone for five years
I ride for the day-ons
Share in or 5 million pesos
Know the sky, I saw him
Forgotten souls in their eyes
Depression no longer hurts me
I saw the devil

[Hook]
Okay, Palm Angels
Feelings of happiness, I see flavi in ​​a Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, I came as a forent
White gold chain, stones clear as Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, Nigga, that's The Wrong Way
Feelings of happiness, I see Flavi in ​​Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, came as a forent
White gold chain, stones like Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, nigga, that's wrong way (ye, ye, ye)
You might so like [Part 2]
McM bag, always there
They talk too much, the niggas are quiet
You can't afford my lifestyle
Copy the wave because you better don't know (ye, ye)
Goofies say: "This way, gangsters don't look like this"
Colorful hair because the world is so gray
Colorful stacks, they look like a peacock
The mainstream will then check the sound (ye) in a few years
The jeans are ripped
Get Amiri from Farfetch
The club is shit, prank my name from the cunning
That you snitched me, I will never forgive you
If it has to be, I also go over corpses
But never about that of my own slimes
Yee! I say ': "Slatt! Slime-Love All the Time "
Red dots on the forehead of my enemy

[Hook]
Okay, Palm Angels
Feelings of happiness, I see flavi in ​​a Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, I came as a forent
White gold chain, stones clear as Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, Nigga, that's The Wrong Way
Feelings of happiness, I see Flavi in ​​Balmain
God’s Race, I'm Blessed, came as a forent
White gold chain, stones like Bombay
You come for drugs, but believe me, Nigga, that's wrong way
[Outro]
Yes, this is Wrong Way3embed
