And if it were her? ( + Es +) Lyrics [letter of "and, if it were her? ( + Es +)"]

[Pablo Alboran]
She slips and I get hit
And although sometimes I don't care

[Pastori girl]
I know that the day I lose her I will suffer for her again
That appears and hides

[Abel Pintos]
That leaves and stays
[Rozalén]
What is a question and is answer
What is my darkness, star

[Antonio Carmona]
She combs my soul and tangles me

[Antonio Carmona + Laura Pausini]
Go with me but I don't know where it goes

[Laura Pausini]
My rival, my partner
That is so inside my life
And at the same time, it's so out

[Shakira]
I know I will lose myself again
And I will find her again
But with another face and a different name and another body

[Antonio Orozco]
But it is still her
That takes me again
It never answers me

[Juanes]
If when turning the wheel
She becomes cold and becomes eternal
You Might Also Like [Tommy Torres]
A sigh in the storm, to which his voice changed so many times

[Pablo Alboran]
People who go and what is always her

[Manuel Carrasco]
That lies and denies me
That forgets and reminds me
But if my mouth is wrong

[Jesse & Joy]
But if my mouth is wrong
And when I call it I name another

[Joy]
Sometimes you feel compassion

[India Martínez]
For this crazy, blind and crazy heart

[Pablo López]
Be, whatever God may be
My crime is the awkwardness of ignoring that there are those who have no heart

[Malú]
And he burns, burn and burn me
Nerd
And if it were her?
No no no...
[Vanesa Martín]
Sometimes he feels compassion for this crazy, blind and crazy heart
It was?

[David Bisbal]
Who tells me if it was her?
And if life is a wheel and turns and nobody knows when it has to jump
And I look at her ...

[India Martínez]
And if it were her?
And if it were her? Embed
