To My Love (Tainy Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "To My Love (Tainy Remix)"]

[Intro]
(Chiflidos)

[Verse 1]
I was thinking about the night I saw you
The same that you abandoned me without thinking (without thinking)
And I gave you my heart
A dark night without looking back
[Pre-car]
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To My Love, to My Love

[Chorus]
I gave you my love
He ran and did not come back
I gave you my love
He ran and did not come back

[Verse 2]
I was looking at your eyes and I left (I also left)
Feeling your smile, hearing you talk (Ja-Aha)
And you gave me your heart (your heart)
That dark night without asking me more

[Pre-car]
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To My Love, to My Love

[Chorus 2]
I gave you my love
I ran and did not come back anymore
I gave you my love
I ran and did not come back anymore

That first night you gave me
It was the last night that I saw you arrive
Just one was enough to
I want to give you the sky and I want to give you more

We don't need anything else
We already gave everything he could give
When we deliver the heart
That dark night until the end

[Chorus-Variation]
I gave you my love
He ran and did not come back
I gave you my love
He ran and did not come back

I gave you my love
I ran and did not come back anymore
I gave you my love
I ran and did not come back (oh, I ran)

[Outro]
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To My Love, to My Love ... to My Love (To My Love)
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love
To my love, to my love ... to my love (to my love) embed
