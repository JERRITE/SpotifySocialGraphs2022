Big Brazy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brazy lil’ boss in a foreign
Bitches mad ‘cause they life is so boring
On my way to the money when I get up in the morning
I need a bag, cause it’s really important
I get to the money and go!
My diamonds water, watch it drip and it glow
I keep a pole, yeah these bitches know
I just want it all, what you hating for?
Yeah, I just want to get to the cake
I’m tryna see a hundred m’s in my face
Tryna do the dash in a fucking wraith
Bitch I’m a boss, watch what you say
Yeah, I don’t wanna talk on the phone
I don’t wanna talk to these hoes
All of these bitches be clones
Trigger happy, finna up the chrome
Hollow tips, coming to your fucking dome (bitch!)
[Chorus]
Try to play me
I’ma show you why they call me big brazy (boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, why they hate me?
I ain’t beefing with a bitch if it don’t pay me (get the fuck on!)
Try to play me
I’ma show you why the call me big brazy (boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, why they hate me?
I ain’t beefing with a bitch if it don’t pay me (get the fuck on!)

[Verse 2]
Pull up in your city with my bitches with me
Draco locked and loaded, aim at your titties
Anyone can get it, don’t got no pity
Nann one of y’all hoes fuck with me
Gun bop, when it shoot like biddy
Nonstop with them bullies got plenty
Aim at your head, shoot it again
Never again will you come at me silly
Uh, shots should’ve been for a long time, yeah
Got beef? Bitch stand in line
I don’t really give bitches time
Red dot, don’t miss when I shoot mine
And these bitches probably think that I was loco (yeah!)
That’s why fucking with the brazy is a no no
You might also like[Chorus]
Try to play me
I’ma show you why they call me big brazy (boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, why they hate me?
I ain’t beefing with a bitch if it don’t pay me (get the fuck on!)
Try to play me
I’ma show you why the call me big brazy (boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, why they hate me?
I ain’t beefing with a bitch if it don’t pay me (get the fuck on!)2Embed
