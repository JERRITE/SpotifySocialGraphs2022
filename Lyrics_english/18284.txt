[Intro]
RANSOM GOT THAT SAUCE IN IT
Lip is painted ', today has no schedule
He wants him to look for her in the Lambo
Tonight Coronamo '
Give it, to finish what started '
OH-OH, Baila Morena, Baila Morena
OH-OH, Baila Morena, Baila Morena (Dance, Dance)
OH-OH, Baila Morena, Baila Morena
Oh oh oh oh
[Verse 1]
A baby like that I needed
To put my hand for your skirt
It is seen that not e 'holy
It's like me, he likes evil
Give him, baby, it's not 'bad
Do not stop moving that I love
Baby, give me one, a probaite '
You ere 'a mamacita
When Chingamo ', Baby, you never take you away'
Move to 'that booty, as chulita as Anitta

[Chorus]
You 'tá, Manina, Nini, Yaya
Give me tequila, I don't want pod '
Dance, I upload the mini, Yaya
Bring me drink, I don't want water
I want Manina, Nini, Yaya (Yaya, Yaya)
Give me tequila, I don't want pod '(Yaya, Yaya)
Dance, I upload the mini, Yaya
Bring me drink, I don't want water

[Verse 2]
Ponte friki, frikitona
You ere 'a chapi-chapter
She and 'beautiful, but do not fall in love
Mommy, and fucking you have to give you a diploma
None match you
She tells me: "Vente, daddy," he takes it to me (take it out)
And I dance Shakira, Waka-Waka (Waka)
She has a beautiful ass but e 'skinny
La Baby E 'Flaca
