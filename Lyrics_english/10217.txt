Watch What Happens Next Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna be a millionaire before I'm 30
But saying that out loud is probably gonna hurt me
Got nothing from my label
Bitch, pay me what you owe me
If you play guitar, you can't want things
And if you really love me
You should want the best for me
Everyone is sad when
When bands break up
Well, guess, guess, guess, guess what?
They're defeated as fuck
Shamed out of money
By their own culture
Nice to fucking meet you
Let's get a little see-through
Watch what happens next, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I like cool shirts, I like cold rings
I want a big house, I want nice things
I want jet packs for all my friends
I want a big house, I want nice things

[Chorus]
You don't love me the same
It's such a fucking shame
I don't deserve as much
As all your pop faves
You wanna hear my art
But only on your terms
So learn these fucking words

[Post-Chorus]
I like cool shirts, I like cold rings
I want a big house, I want nice things
I want jet packs for all my friends
I want a big house, I want nice things

[Verse 2]
I don't think people realize how they're fucking us up
I put autotune on "Worst" and caught all their disgust
Hip hop can do whatever it wants
Like make country songs and hit number one
And that's fucking awesome, we could never do that
All the fans that like us need an easy fucking format
They would boo that, they'd abuse that
It's a cultural hold-back
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I like cool shirts, I like cold rings
I want a big house, I want nice things
I want jet packs for all my friends
I want a big house, I want nice things

[Chorus]
You don't love me the same
It's such a fucking shame
I don't deserve as much
As all your pop faves
You wanna hear my art
But only on your terms
So learn these fucking words

[Bridge]
Let me get this straight, you want a say
In how well I live, if my life's okay
Do I get a car? Hope it's not too nice
Tell me everything you're comfortable with and I'll comply
Can I pay rent? Sure, but not much else
Can I try new sounds? Go fuck yourself
Tell me what I get, tell me what I earn
Tell me all the things you want and I will give up me for you

[Chorus]
You don't love me the same
It's such a fucking shame
I don't deserve as much
As all your pop faves
You wanna hear my art
But only on your terms
So learn these fucking words
You don't love me the same
It's such a fucking shame
I'll never be enough
Until it's too late
You wanna hear my art
But only on your terms
So learn these fucking words
[Post-Chorus]
I like cool shirts, I like cold rings
I want a big house, I want nice things
I want jet packs for all my friends
I want a big house, I want nice things11Embed
