YES MOM Lyrics[Intro]
Bet you've been a fan of me
See me in your fantasies
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah
I'm the one to beat, yeah, mm
I'm the one to beat, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I take my picture, wanna kiss her, I'm like "damn" (Damn)
I see my reflection, got affection 'cause I can
I can't help that I feel myself, yes, I guess I'm a fan
When everything you're looking for is right here where I stand, yeah
[Chorus]
Bet you'vе been a fan of me (Yes Mom)
See me in your fantasiеs (Yes Mom)
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah
What you see is what you get (Yes Mom)
Everything I'm owning it (Yes Mom)
Did it independent 'cause I got what I need so
Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah (yeah)
I'm the one to beat, yeah, mm
I'm the one to beat, yeah

[Verse 2]
20/20 vision with ambition's how I'm made
I can't keep from winning when it's in my DNA
Push me down and I bounce right back
Trampoline and it's in my past
Rising like a phoenix making fire from the ash, yeah

[Chorus]
Bet you've been a fan of me (Yes Mom)
See me in your fantasies (Yes Mom)
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah
What you see is what you get (Yes Mom)
Everything I'm owning it (Yes Mom)
Did it independent 'cause I got what I need so
Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah

Eat that, peep that
I'm the one to beat, yeah
