Bloody Murder Lyrics [Words of "Bloody Murder"]

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of the game like Bloody Murder, like Bloody Murder
My seal is loaded, fuck your charger, yeah fuck your charger
3.5.7 hood in the rover, in the Carter cities
Labal bumper, pomegranate, machine gunner, yeah fuck donors

[Verse 1]
I took a long time but hey I came back, like Jordan I came back
Dedication to all my detainees, the Kush in the pants
Cargo, no counterfeit, that shard fucking
Bigger than one, bigger than you have house so don't ask too many questions
The slave trade is over, increases income
The nose full of coke farts menus, only drugs in the avenue
Well yeah it scrolls that gues-shla, pussy at ke $ ha
The shaved kitty worse than Tahiry, yeah Marianne must slip
Street law I learn the lesson, money as reason
Scented by all the seasons, Coffee Shop in the tiekson
I have already said it I am in the turmoil, I dream that gourmet sums
Big racing cars than German sedans, palette palettes at the controls
I have 23 rods, a young city, I dream of getting out
I have the Glock in the FUS, you will feel so you would better leave
Well yeah 5-9 my street is ghetto, compare not to rap game
NVR, Schweitzer, Roubaix, Hem, Lille, Tourcouing, I'm just at the start of my career
[Chorus]
I'm afraid of the game like Bloody Murder, like Bloody Murder
My seal is loaded, fuck your charger, yeah fuck your charger
3.5.7 hood in the rover, in the Carter cities
Labal bumper, pomegranate, machine gunner, yeah fuck donors
I'm afraid of the game like Bloody Murder, like Bloody Murder
My seal is loaded, fuck your charger, yeah fuck your charger
3.5.7 hood in the rover, in the Carter cities
Labal bumper, pomegranate, machine gunner, yeah fuck donors

[Verse 2]
Rap game is worse than a big film of balls, that hypocrites that come to
Big gamos for rent, only the leak that conveys
To listen to them is all gangsters, are war in rap
For a little worse buzz than pussies, all of them are for Biggie and PAC
More mature than them from the top of my twenty, it is real
Rapper of the people listened to in all tieks, all the alleys
Negro on me you should have bet instead of Mediser
Today you hurt, you regret like your first handjob
Well yeah history-geo is the same, colonS treat us shitty
Soon they will bend the spine to do me at their concerts
Traces of whips on the body, no tears on the face
The revolver look draws if you stare

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of the game like Bloody Murder, like Bloody Murder
My seal is loaded, fuck your charger, yeah fuck your charger
3.5.7 hood in the rover, in the Carter cities
Labal bumper, pomegranate, machine gunner, yeah fuck donors
I'm afraid of the game like Bloody Murder, like Bloody Murder
My seal is loaded, fuck your charger, yeah fuck your charger
3.5.7 hood in the rover, in the Carter cities
Ballery vest, pomegranate, machine gunner, yeah fuck the donors Might also like5embed
