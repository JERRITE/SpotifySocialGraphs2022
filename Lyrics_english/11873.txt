I am not seen so bad (nsmvtm) lyrics [lyrics of "I am not seen so bad (nsmvtm)"]

[Verse 1: Olga & Natalia]
After so many days, so many months
What I thought, I wasn't going to forget
Today I found you so different
And now I know, you don't care

[Pre-car: Makis & Camila]
And the truth is that I have changed
Without having you by my side
I knew how to join the thousand pieces
That you left, that you left
[Choir: Natalia, Makis, Olga & Camila]
You broke my heart
And no, I don't look so bad
What you did to me was a favor
And no, it didn't get so bad
I'm better than you found me
What did you do not try to fix it
You broke my heart
But I don't look so bad

[Verse 2: Olga]
Your kisses already lost them, there is nothing left of you
Nor the lies that I thought so much

[Pre-Caro: Camila & Makis]
Do not think about returning (do not think about returning)
Yes alone, you know how to run (run)
Beg does not look good
If you left me

[Choir: Natalia, Makis, Olga & Camila]
You broke my heart
And no, I don't look so bad
What you did to me was a favor
And no, it didn't get so bad
I'm better than you found me
What you damaged do not try to fix it
You broke my heart
But I don't look so bad

And the truth is that I have changed
Without having you by my side
I knew how to join the thousand pieces
That you left, that you left

[Choir: Natalia, Makis, Olga & Camila]
You broke my heart (heart, heart)
And no, I don't look so bad
What you did to me was a favor (favor)
And no, it didn't get so bad
I'm better than you found me
What you damaged do not try to fix (no)
You broke my heart
But I am not seen so Malembed
