Do not notice Lyrics [letter of "do not notice" by Andy Rivera]

So much time next to you
And I still can't understand you
Everything I do to see you happy
It does not seem enough

I have stopped doing
I liked things
Just because they disliked you
I always try to please you in everything
But when more love I show you
Less you notice and more fight me
And when I don't show you anything
You are happy and you want me more (x2)

You tell me, to show you much more love
But tell me, for you to do it if it is worse
And he always acted as if ours did not care
You tell me that it seems that I will not love you anymore




I have changed
Enough, because I really care
I became a retailer, but you still don't notice
I make you many details over and over again
But for you to do them, if you never see them

And you never realize, what I do for you
You always keep looking bad about me
And you never realize what I do for you

But when more love I show you
Less you notice and more fight me
And when I don't show you anything
You are happy and you want me more
You might also like I don't go out so much, I don't take so much
For how much and even this for you is not so much
I don't go out so much, I don't take so much
For how much and even this for you is not so much

So much time next to you
And I still can't understand you
Everything I do to see you happy
It does not seem enough




I have stopped doing
I liked things
Just because they disliked you
I always try to please you in everything

But when more love I show you
Less you notice and more fight me
And when I don't show you anything
You are happy and I wish me more
