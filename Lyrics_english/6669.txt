I think that first intro is the one, was the one
Water!
Wet, wet
Oh my God, Ronny (One, two, three)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh-yuh, yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, okay, ahem

[Verse 1]
He gon' need a first-aid kit, ain't doin' no waitin'
This ass whoopin' is free, just like the Masons
Giant what I am, Attack on Titan
A beast in your reality, somethin' like lycan
To your bitch I've taken a likin'
My dick is her cup of Joe, not talkin' 'bout Biden
Why they mosquito? They always be bitin'
I'm strikin' like lightnin', my watch on Ben 10
Poppin' like vitamins with the nine right beside me
And then it's fuck the economy 'cause they taxing unproperly
Said I play with the paper, I said I do origami, I said, "Huh..."
Okay, wipe ya nose, wе cold
What we follow? The code
I'm an animal, you see thе silo
Horns on the top the head, a nigga goat
Rocket launcher, we tote, just like Starbursts, in throats
In a ghost, Danny Phantom, on bro
Know that I be picky, I eenie-miney the mo
[Chorus]
Yuh (Go, go, go, go)
Yuh (Ain't from Chicago, go, go, go, go)
Yuh (Go, go, go, go)
Yuh (Put that on my folks)
Yuh (G-Go, go, go, go, yeah)
Yuh (Go, go, go, go, yeah)
Yuh (Go, go, go, go)
Yuh, yuh-yuh (Put that on my folks)

[Verse 2]
I go crazy, I Steve-O
Figured I'd blow like a damn C4
Keep the beam, Dragon Ball Z, Piccolo
Niggas think I'm scared to get jumped, Geronimo
Wish a nigga would, like Pinocchio nose
We gon' beat 'em, leave 'em purple, look like one of Barney's toes
That's just how it goes
All of my opponents get disintegrated from the head to the floor
Like a rubber band, we show resistance
Said I'm pissin' on 'em, these niggas my bedpan
Bitch, I've been fly, Harry Potter or Peter Pan
We gon' wax 'em, sorta somethin' like Daniel-San
Call me senpai, animatedly fucked the world, but no hentai
You outdated, yo' flow wrinkly like a hang dry (Yuh, yuh)
So what's the hate for? I'm on a Tron bike, about to skate by, ayy (Okay)
Golden like retriever, it's a wonder like I'm Stevie (Yuh, yuh)
From the bottom, like bikini, crown on me like Nefertiti (Yuh, haha)
Litty like a titty, drip or drown in this city (Yuh, yuh)
I got my floatie, what's the deal-y, bitch? (Yuh, bitch, water!)
