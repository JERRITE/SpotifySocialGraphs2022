I don't just go to Lyrics [lyrics by "I don't walk"]

[Intro]
Earthlings in The Beats
The combs 'does not bring it' just like me, mamabicho
Hey

[Pre-car]
Taa'o pa 'back, like Tony Montana (Montana)
My name weighs like my Cuban (Cuban)
From Guacamayo and the combs' banana (banana)
Living today because I don't know tomorrow (no)
If a whore is turned or a corduroy is turned
On the street I learned that the monkey dances for wool
[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
Daddy, I'm not alone (alone)
The streets of the under world control them (Yeh)
I am loyal, I do not betray them (no)
The one who lamba, with the AK was mouth
Give him, goat ', vamo' to kill 'I'm alone (are you crazy, boy?)
I am read pa 'war against everything (Yeh, Yeh)
Every time I get hooked to me (and let yourself be carried away)
Mine panas like to give lead
Give him, Cabrone ', vamo' to kill '(woh)

[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
The most bastard of the cast
We hunt you and take out the flamenco '(PRR)
The Draco Patea and the bullets whip your face and body like the Mannchenco (PRR)
Of to'a position '
I have sound addicted panas, the boys, the combs '' and drum (prr, prr)
And you guide you 'from a bridge by Chota written in Cartelone' (Yeh)
The comb one and a half (woh)
Blood on the street, the only remedy (PRR)
I send a guy (Yeh) and they will play floor you and to 'the one who gets in the middle
Mera, tell me, Yayo (wow)
Coat the longest comb to 'Los Guacamayo'
That today these people fall when the stick makes the flash, the sound of the lightning (prr)
Tomb the Movie de Julito Maraña
Do not convince your flow or your azaña (na)
I take out the cell phone and they will chop the spider '
Here the quietest is damaged, so I don't convey me
Bring me a mushroom and turn on the incense '
Let's provide for the dark and for the new beginning
I'm blessed (Yeh)
From so much ice on the neck I have been cold
Diamonds and torque that I have inverted (wuh)

Daddy, I'm not alone (alone)
The streets of the under world control them (Yeh)
I am loyal, I do not betray them (no)
The one who lamba, with the AK was mouth
Give him, goat ', vamo' to kill 'I'm alone (are you crazy, boy?)
I am read pa 'war against everything (Yeh, Yeh)
Every time I get hooked to me (let yourself be carried away)
Mine panas like to give lead
Give him, goat ', vamo' to kill '(uh)

[Verse 2: Miky Woodz]
I do not betray who trusted me
Nor who helped me when nobody gave it to me
Vo 'to continue loyal with mine
Money or fame changed me (Never)
I always do alone, but four eye '(ey)
They have seen me calm, not when I get angry
Fantastic and face decorate you
Yours 'loosen and give you in a tray' e gold (prr, prr, prr)
Like Pilate, many are not brothers, they are panas per time
I have seen them snore, but time passes and I see them dead 'in a portrait
Hijuepin, nobody runs you and mine go out to hunt you by car or in peace
The guns are guys, vamo 'to kill' although later the problem brings tail and ...
Lead, lead, lead, lead (PRR)
How do we do it, ask how (Hol 'Up)
After it puts you in a kilo, they celebrate with Romo (Yeh, Yeh)
Take care that they don't get caught out 'and cone
What the hell, after you put you in the free newspaper I give you a promo
Nigga, I'M DONE
[Chorus: Bryant Myers, Miky Woodz]
Daddy, I'm not alone (alone; bastard, really. Miky Woodz)
The streets of the under world control them (Yeh)
I am loyal, I do not betray them (no)
The one who lamba, with the AK was mouth
Give him, Cabrone ', vamo' to kill '(prr, prr, prr, prr)
I am not alone
Each party that touched the mouth
Always loyal, I don't betray mine
You have to stay firm even if the mono caught you '
I killed you, bo 'if I pissed off
