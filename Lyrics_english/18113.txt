Hot All The Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna be hot all the time
To remind you, you'll never be mine
Get what I want and fucking thrive
To remind you, I'm still alive
Fantasies of when I taste
The teardrops on your face, it gets me high, high
That's just the icing on the cake
Baby, I, I wanna be hot all the time

[Chorus]
Does it sting for you (Ooh, why?)
When I sing for you? (I, I)
Does it torture you? (Why?)
Ooh, I wanna be hot all the time (I, I)
[Verse 2]
I wanna be hot all the time
Just to make your blood turn to fire
I wanna be young, I wanna be wild
All the things you didn't like

[Chorus]
Doеs it sting for you (Ooh, I, I, I)
When I sing for you? (I, I)
Does it torture you? (Ooh, I, I, I)
Ooh, I wanna bе hot all the time (I, I)

[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I
I wanna be hot all the time (I, I, I)
I, I, I
I wanna be hot all the time (I, I, I)

[Bridge]
I'll break your heart like you've broken mine
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Without you, without you
Feels so damn good in my skin
So hot in the state I'm in

[Chorus]
Does it sting for you (Ooh, I, I, I)
When I sing for you? (I, I)
Does it touch you? (Ooh, I, I, I)
Ooh, I wanna be hot all the timeYou might also likeEmbed
