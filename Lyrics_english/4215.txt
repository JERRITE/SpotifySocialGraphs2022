Lyrics prohibited loves [letter of "prohibited loves"]

[Enter: Yomo & Periquito]
How many do not like the forbidden, ah?
What and what

[Saying: Lenny Tavárez]
Baby, I know (I know; I know)
That you are not anyone who respects yourself
Baby, I know (I know; I know)
And you are not my bed because you are with him
I will be your lover, your love bandit
Baby, if you liked, stay with me (you know ')
I don't want to see you hidden
And you know I can't be your friend
So I do not know
[Chorus: Periquito]
I don't know why you're not here with me
Love, love, forbidden love, oh
Prohibited, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lenny Tavárez]
(Lenny Tavárez, Baby)
When you want to tell him, that I am better than him
Tell him that you want to see me
Tell him, that I bring you crazy, Loquita (what?)
Baby, I don't understand (PLO), why aren't you here with me? (Hears)
The last time I saw you I gave you advice 'and they weren't a friend', I continue
I just want you to forget your name
Remember the penalty at the Three Sinkred
I don't know you, but I do, 'to have you follow with me (-Mo-Migo)

[Choir: Periquito & Lenny Tavárez]
I don't know why you're not here with me
Love, love, forbidden love, oh
Prohibited, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Yomo, Trebol Clan]
(Didi, di-di '; ma', ma ')
We are going hidden ', I
The undue passion, playing 'life
There is no fear when we undress '(na')
And our unimos bodies ', both of them making' one
You Might Also Like [Bridge: Yomo]
That room keeps the secret where I make you a woman
And pain and pleasure plays' in the same team, the same symphony
I telling the 'time' that you are again ', ah-ah
And I don't know love, I don't know, why, why will it be?
What you, what do you give me ', when I see you again?
That room keeps the secret where I make you a woman
And pain and pleasure plays' in the same team, the same symphony
I telling the 'time' that you are again '

[Choir: Yomo & Lenny Tavárez]
I don't know why you're not here with me
Love, love, forbidden love (ah), oh
Prohibited, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Periquito]
It's me who makes you fly
It's me who knows how to love you
It's me who makes you wrong
It is me and like me no more
Woman (wuh), walk and see
Want to see, you know well that I'm your man

[Chorus: Periquito]
I don't know why you're not here with me
Love, love, forbidden love, oh
Prohibited, oh, oh-oh
[Outro: Periquito, Lenny Tavárez, Yomo]
