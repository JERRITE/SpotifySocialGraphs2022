The black shirt Lyrics [lyrics of "the black shirt"]

[Intro]
One for poor and ugly, home, but Antojao '
Ah, children

[Verse 1]
I have the black shirt, today my love is mourning
Today I have a shame in my soul and it is because of your spell
Today I know that you don't love me anymore and that is what hurts me the most
That I have the black shirt and a shame that hurts me
[Pre-car]
I seem badly that I only stayed
And it was pure all your lie
What damn bad luck mine
That that day I found you
By drinking from the Malevo poison of your love
I was dying and full of pain
I breathed from that bitter smoke from your goodbye
And since you left I have only

[Chorus]
I have the black shirt because I have black I have the soul
I lost my calm for you and I almost lost to my bed
Cama-Cama, Come On, Baby, I tell you with dissimulation
That I have the black shirt and below I have the deceased

[Interlude]
To stab you whenever you want mommy! Juya!
Just as he hears it, mika

[Verse 2]
I have the black shirt, already your love does not interest me
What yesterday knew Gloria today knows me pure
Wednesday afternoon and you who do not arrive, do not even signs signs
And I with the black shirt and your suitcases at the door

And it was pure all your lie
What damn bad luck mine
That that day I found you
By drinking from the Malevo poison of your love
I was dying and full of pain
I breathed from that bitter smoke from your goodbye
And since you left I have only

[Chorus]
I have the black shirt
Because Black I have the soul
I lost my calm
And I almost lost my bed
Cama-Cama, Come On, Baby
I tell you with dissimulation
I have the black shirt
And below I have the deceased

[Chorus]
I have the black shirt
Because Black I have the soul
I lost my calm
And I almost lost my bed
Cama-Cama, Come On, Baby
I tell you with dissimulation
I have the black shirt
And below I have the deceased31embed
