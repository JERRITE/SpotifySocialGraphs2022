Get to You Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mmm
I guess we'll meet again, my friend
It’s not so often that you come around
Until our track has seen its end
Imma be running, babe
Mmm

[Verse 2]
I spent the whole night driving home
Just wishing you would call and tell me
To turn around like I ain’t done
With what I started, babe
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Finally think I'm starting with you
Can I start with you, oh?

[Chorus]
How do I get to you again?
How do I get to you again?
How do I get to you again, babe?
How do I get to you again (again)?
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I heard she’d never say she’d fall
She just had taken something stupid
She probably won’t expect my call
So I ain’t making it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Knowing that I’m calling to you, oh
Can I call to you, yeah?

[Chorus]
How do I get to you again, babe?
How do I get to you again?
How do I get to you again, babe?
How do I get to you again (again)?

They wanna know how I’ve been living (good)
They’re listening to the shit that I have written
They say I knew I had it in you baby
Last man to touch the mic, he went missing
The only thing I know is what it isn’t
Didn't think I had it in me baby, yeah
They wanna know how I’ve been living (how do I get to you again?)
They’re listening to the shit that I have written
They say I knew I had it in you (how do I get to you again?), babe
Last man to touch the mic, he went missing (how do I get to you again?)
The only thing I know is what it isn’t
Didn't think I had it in me baby, yeah

[Outro]
How do I get to you again, yeah?5Embed
