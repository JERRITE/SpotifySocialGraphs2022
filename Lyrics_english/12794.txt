Coexist Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're smoking cigarettes
In the back of your house
I watch the liquor spill
And drip from your mouth
You said you're holding on
To old memories
[They] keep you from moving on
To all of your dreams

[Chorus]
But it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I wanna' know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew
But it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I wanna' know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew
[Verse 2]
Cut it off, cut it off, take pieces of me
Castaway, ricochet to where you want to be
And when you feel complete
Give 'em back to me

[Chorus]
Cause it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I want to know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew
Cause it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I want to know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew

[Bridge]
Anymore, I am sure
And then I took you by the wrist
Told you that we can't coexist
Friendly banter, tonight's a blur
"Are you good?" and "How ya been?"
We do this time and time again

[Chorus]
Cause it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I want to know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew
Cause it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
When I feel you again I want to know if it hurts
But to tell you the truth, I'm not the person you knew
Cause it wasn't the best, cause it wasn't the worstYou might also like3Embed
