Light turned on (Remastered) Lyrics ["Light Letter"]

[Pre-car]
A mamacita of those that are not seen, of those that are not seen, Yah
I ran it and I wanted to eat it, I wanted to eat it, YAH-AH (YAH-AH)
And I took it in the ship for the moon
It wasn't Rosalia but I wanted height
In the bed he did not hide, he gave everything (Wuh-Uh)

[Chorus]
He did me on, 'I put the' lu 'turned on'
What was coming when it was undressed
He did me on, 'I put the' lu 'turned on'
What was coming when it was undressed (ey, me)
[Verse 1]
I said: "Come on" and find you 'available (Blep!)
The ship is read and is full of fuel
With that booty, ma ', is' irresistible
I do the third part of the incredibles, of nothing
From Lejo 'I saw her with her picket, but she told me that she wanted strong, with me she jumped
Just a call and it came to me and followed me, it passed it to the room
Baby, movie
Walk and uproar the enrollment
Exclusivity, nobody links it
And I crazy about having it in a capsule
Baby, movie
Walk and upset the tuition (OKEY)
Exclusivity, nobody links it
And I crazy about having it in a capsule (ah)

[Chorus]
He did me on '(ey), I put the' lu 'turned on'
What was coming when it was undressed
He did me on, 'I put the' lu 'turned on'
What was coming when it was undressed

[Verse 2]
Hey
I lowered the pantysito that 'taba cool (oh)
And I caught a tattoo with a broken heart of the highschool (haha)
The Demon, I kissed her to 'knew Gloria (and now, haha)
Now we compete for victory
In the room both with nothing
She on top of me killing the desire
The world is ours, Tony Montana
You have 'with me this weekend, Yeh-Yeh (haha)

[Chorus]

He did me on, 'I put the' lu 'turned on'
