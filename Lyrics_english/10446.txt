Take me on the floor lyrics [Verse 1]
The lights are out and i barely know you
We're going up and the place is slowing down (Down, Down)
I Knew You'd Come Around
You captivate me, something about you has got me
I was Lonely, Now You Make Me Feel Alive (Alive, Alive)
Will you be mine tonight?

[Chorus]
Take me on the floor (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I Can't Take It Anymore (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I can give you more (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch
[VERSE 2]
My heart is racing as you're moving closer
You take me higher with every breath i take (i take)
Would be wrong to stay?
One Look at You And I Know What You're Thinking
Time's a Bitch and My Heart is Sinking Down (Down, Down)
You turn me inside out

[Chorus]
Take me on the floor (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I Can't Take It Anymore (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I want you, I want you, I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
I can give you more (Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da)
You kill me, you kill me, you kill me with your touch

[Bridge]
I Wanna Kiss A Girl
I Wanna Kiss A Girl
I Wanna Kiss A Boy

I Wanna Kiss a Girl (Do, do you, do you, do you?)
I Wanna Kiss a Girl (Do, do you, do you, do, do you?)
I Wanna Kiss A Boy (Do, do you, do you, do, do you?)
I Wanna Kiss A (Kiss A, Kiss A, Kiss A)
Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da
Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da
Da-Da-Da-Da, Da-Da-Da-Da (OH)
