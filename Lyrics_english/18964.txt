Redemption City LyricsLost in a dream high and wide
Whatever price to keep it by your side
The steps to the top are very steep
King of the hill when all are fast asleep

But I'm stuck in between
And I know you know what I mean
What a pity... redemption city

Broken hearts toast another round
And drink to the lost, there's not a soul to be found
Lonely boy says come what may
I hate to see it always end this way
But I'm stuck in between
And I know you know what I mean
What a pity... redemption city

Simple words remind me
Cluttered room, it haunts me
Come back yesterday

The soul is tired and you wantsto go home
And close the curtain on everything you've known
But the curtain is high, wide and long
And kills the dream so we sing this simple song

Stuck in between
And I know you know what I mean
What a pity... redemption city
What a pity...You might also likeEmbed
