Infinity (Piano Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, this love, I'll never let it die
Can't be touched by no one
I'd like to see them try
I'm a mad man for your touch
Girl, I've lost control
I'm gonna make this last forever
Don't tell me it's impossible

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
[Verse 2]
Darling, my soul
You know it aches for yours
And you've been filling this hole
Since you were born, oh, oh
You're the reason I believe in fate
You're my paradise
And I'll do anything to be your love
I'll be your sacrifice

[Chorus]
'Causе I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
'Cause I lovе you for infinity
I love you for infinity

[Post-Chorus]
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh

[Bridge]
Meet me at the bottom of the ocean
Where the time is frozen
Where all the universes open
Love isn't random, we are chosen
And we could wear the same crown
Keep slowing your heart down
We are the gods now
You might also like[Chorus]
I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity

[Outro]
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-oh1Embed
