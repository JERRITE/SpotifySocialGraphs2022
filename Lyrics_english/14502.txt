[Verse 1: the Joaqui]
Look at the eye 'e' die of pain
I know there is another guacha that has your love
You see that you found someone better
It is seen that I did not reach what I gave you
Forgive me fight ', jealousy, scenes, night' in candle waiting for me
It is not that I do not love you, do not believe, to overcome everything and forget you
By day I bank, at night and 'more difficult
If not as your body, Turro, I swear I enter Crisi '
I never thought to fall in love like this
I think you did macumba in me

[Verse 2: the Joaqui]
When I saw you with her, I wanted to re-mulmar
But I show myself Chelo, you won't see me break
Although another fox occupies my place
Nene, you're going to miss me
Now I'm going on tour, forget, with my Ã‘era '
Kill sorrow 'in alcohol, I was your partner
But the things change, there wasn't
It was so depressing, now I'm first
I go with the band to forget about you
Papi, yes, touch, touch
I don't want your love anymore
Forgive me, chocolate
Kiss you to another rocha
