Canâ€™t Fall N Luv Lyrics[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Smooky MarGielaa]
Yeah, too much ice on me, got a young nigga froze
Heard they hatin' on lil' Smooky but they said they was my bros

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Smooky MarGielaa]
All I really know is get them bands on the road
I'm just tryna fuck, can't fall in love with no ho, yeah
Too much ice on me, it got a young nigga froze
I do what I want, I don't follow dress code
Uh, hop up out this 'Rari, two tone AP on froze
All type designer on my body, Gucci head to toe
Heard they hatin' on lil' Smooky but they said they was my bros
Pull up foreign, tinted windows, can't see these bands I'm countin' on
[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Can't see these bands I'm countin' on
Fashion Nova jeans cover her thong
AP my wrist, honeycomb
I'm on the road, ain't comin' home
She thick as fuck, she got some thighs on her
Grab on her ass, put pliers on her
I fell in love with styrofoam
I was just fuckin' a redbone

[Verse 2: Smooky MarGielaa]
Can you please stop blowin' up my phone? Girl, I'm way too busy
I just took this trip to Mexico, racks on me, got plenty
Skrrt, watch me skrrt off in this Ghost, new Bentley, ain't no renting
Too much money, I can't even fold, too much guap, it can't fold

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Smooky MarGielaa]
All I really know is get them bands on the road
I'm just tryna fuck, can't fall in love with no ho, yeah
Too much ice on me, it got a young nigga froze
I do what I want, I don't follow dress code
Uh, hop up out this 'Rari, two tone AP on froze
All type designer on my body, Gucci head to toe
Heard they hatin' on lil' Smooky but they said they was my bros
Pull up foreign, tinted windows, can't see these bands I'm countin' on

Oh, counting bands, oh
Uh, young, I'm rich as fuck
Uh, in my Lam' truck
Uh, lil' boy can get jumped
Got the semi tucked if he run up
Uh, that boy out of luck
Big racks lift my bank up
Cares 'bout countin' up

[Verse 4: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Damn, shawty bad, and she thick as fuck
She dance, shakin' that ass, I just wanna fuck
I get in my bag, I just be countin' it up

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan & Smooky MarGielaa]
All I really know is get them bands on the road
I'm just tryna fuck, can't fall in love with no ho, yeah
Too much ice on me, it got a young nigga froze
I do what I want, I don't follow dress code
Uh, hop up out this 'Rari, two tone AP on froze
All type designer on my body, Gucci head to toe
Heard they hatin' on lil' Smooky but they said they was my bros
Pull up foreign, tinted windows, can't see these bands I'm countin' onEmbed
