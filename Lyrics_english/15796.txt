I am not a lady (non sono a signora) lyrics "
It is not a novelty
People will judge
Crossing opinions

I start another day
A couple more kilometers
No horizon
With anyone who cares
Leaving my dreams
In the room of any motel
With the face covered
With revolt life
You marked my life
Leaving me forgotten here
Absurd sacrifice
And how to remind you now

I am not a Mrs
Of impeccable behavior, in life
I am not a Mrs
Fighting and losing the war that my life is made

I believed in your feelings
And lived only for you
You preferred to follow the wind
Without thinking about me
And how sad it felt
You used me like a mannequin
A horrible adventure
An absurd story
I stopped being yours
I went from another as I went from you
And I forgot how to love you
I don't want to remind you now

I am not a Mrs
Of impeccable behavior, in life
I am not a Mrs
Fighting and losing the war that my life is made
I am not a Mrs
Of impeccable behavior in life
You Might Also Likeno am a lady
Of impeccable behavior in life
I am not a Mrs
Fighting and losing the war that my life is made
I am not a Mrs
Of impeccable behavior is lifeembed
