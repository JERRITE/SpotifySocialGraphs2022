Lyrics love hurts [Lyrics for "Love hurts"]

[Intro: Aleks Syntek & Ana Torroja]
Love Hurts Without You
It hurts to kill

[Verse 1: Aleks Syntek & Ana Torroja]
I feel the humidity in me
To see you cry, not even talk
If you leave here
I think I will suffer
Today I would like to stop time
The distance between the two
But the light of the sky went out
The sun does not come out anymore
[Verse 2: Aleks Syntek & Ana Torroja]
I am fragility without you
How to overcome the end?
Where do you harm?
I don't know, and recover went
Neither you nor I are guilty
But we are vulnerable
They're life's things
What is left to live?

[Choir: Aleks Syntek & Ana Torroja]
Love Hurts Without You
It rains to wet
Love Hurts Without You
It hurts to kill
Love Hurts Without You
Everything is so gray

[Verse 3: Aleks Syntek & Ana Torroja]
Today I would like to stop time
The distance between the two
But the light of the sky went out
The sun does not come out anymore
I am fragility without you
How to overcome the end?
Where do you harm?
I don't know, and recover went
Neither you nor I are guilty
But we are vulnerable
They're life's things
What is left to live?

[Bridge: Aleks Syntek, Ana Torroja & both]
I feel the humidity in me
(I feel the humidity in me)
To see you cry, not even talk
(To see you cry, not to mention)
If you leave here
(If you leave here)
I think I will suffer
(I think I will suffer)
I feel the humidity in me
(I feel the humidity in me)
To see you cry, not even talk
(To see you cry, not to mention)
If you leave here
(If you leave here)
I think I am doing
I think I will suffer

It rains to wet
Love Hurts Without You
It hurts to kill
Love Hurts Without You
Everything is so graybed
