Bodies Lyrics[Intro]
(Riding)
I had came
I had came out 38th street, you know, Nawf side (Yuh)
Lit fuck
Oh, bitch ass nigga, what you scared of?
We was slangin' iron and these bitch ass niggas ain't the niggas from across the track
And them niggas won't on none of that shit, you hear me?
Old bitch ass nigga, I stood on everything
(Bi-Bighead on the beat)
And you bitch ass niggas gon' die 'bout it
[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Hunnid bands on my head, who want it?
Gang symbols on the top of my motor
I don't want no diamonds for to cover my Rollie
Made nigga, I'm the truth, I was chosen
Preaching bad, know the game like a spokesmen
Niggas bitches, I can tell from they motions
Straight out the Nawf, diamonds hit from the mouth
I done slept on the floor with the rats and the roaches
My young niggas turnt in this bitch and they bogus
And them done fill yo' ass up with them doses
Kept it one hundred, had lows, can hold 'em
Tryna stay focused, snake by the closest
Niggas bitches, that's that shit I ain't feelin'
They know I'm with it, play, I'm clearing the business
In penitentiary with my nigga, he stressin'
Tryin' to get a call, he just got a sentence
I remember I ain't ever forget it
Just know I love you, we ain't talk in a minute
These motions can't hide, they need to collide
And this for Lil Dave, we finally did it
The last body, I don't like how they did it
I wish they could've put 'em all in his fitted
But they tore his body up with the chrome
But fuck that, it's however you get it

You can go ask the neighbors I walk the streets with holes in my tennis
Thank God I got my own now they hating that I'm in it
I hiding I ain't pussy it’s  gonna be a killing
All my niggas died from a bullet I'll make you feel that glizzy

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I ain't with that lame shit bitch stay back (Ya)
Riding in the new May back (mhmm)
Beep Beep when the mission pack
Take it out straighten up let a count up all these racks (mhmm)
For the bag I ain't going on the stage for da front
I be having this shit I don't cap I don't front (Ya)
New fit wit a brand new gun
New note took for da' bitch I don't even stunt' (Huh)
Draw down with that thang he gon run
Real nigga he official he don't call till its done
Been loyal it come with position I'm fillling attention i keep it One Hundred and One
Get it in the rain I ain't worried about the sun (what)
Stayed down through the pain I'm as strong as they come
Them hitters gonna hit on my hut they gonna hunt
Forever I stand I'm a lead in the front4Embed
