Take A Chance With Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
The kind that colors the sky
Heart intangible
Slips away faster than dandelion fluff in the sunlight
And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
Uncovering the dreams, he dreams at night
As much and hard as he tries to hide
I can see right through, see right through

[Verse 2]
His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
I'll fade away somehow if he's too loud
What I would give for me to get my feet
Back on the ground, head off the clouds
I laugh at how we're polar opposites
I read him like a book, and he's a clueless littlе kid
Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
Just to makе him smile, make him smile
[Chorus]
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me, take a chance with me

[Verse 3]
His kiss you'd kill for
Just one and you're done for
Electricity surging in the air
He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That I'm hopelessly captivated
By a boy who thinks love’s overrated
How did I get myself in this arrangement?
It baffles me, too, baffles me, too

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
You might also like[Bridge]
In the end, we only regret
The chances we didn't take
I'll be your safety net
So, why not raise the stakes?
And I can hear your heart from across the room
Pulsing through my veins
I know you need this, too
Lie to me all you please
I can see right through
See right through

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Oh, why can’t we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me, take a chance with me2Embed
