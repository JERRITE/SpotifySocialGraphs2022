MoneyOnMyMind Lyrics[Intro]
Money
M-money
Money on my, money on my

[Verse 1]
Living in a tragedy
Suburban paradise
All I ever wanna see
Is triple dollar signs
I don't want no enemies
Don't get in the way of what's mine
[Verse 2]
You can keep the jewelry
I'll take the enterprise
Ruler of a dynasty
Yeah, a paradigm
Swimming in the currency
Drowning in the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus]
Zeros add up like nothing
Stack 'em to the right of one
And count them up, baby, show me something
Cha-ching, cha-ching

[Chorus]
Money on my mind
Used to think about you all the time
Even though you nеver were my typе
Almost let you go and kill my vibe
My life's richer now (Money)
Ever since you left the picture now
Baby, I've been better by myself
With money on my, money on my mind (Money)
Money on my, money on my mind (Money)
Money on my, money on my
You might also like[Verse 3]
I want the kind of love
Dollars can't buy
But till the day it comes
I'll use them to pass time
I blow a little kiss
Blinded by my wrist
Screaming out, "Show me the money" (Show me the money)

[Chorus]
Money on my mind (Money)
Used to think about you all the time
Even though you never were my type
Almost let you go and kill my vibe
My life's richer now (Money)
Ever since you left the picture now
Baby, I've been better by myself
With money on my, money on my mind (Money)
Money on my, money on my mind (Money)
Money on my, money on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Zeros add up like nothing
Stack 'em to the right of one
And count them up, baby, show me something
Cha-ching, cha-ching
[Chorus]
Money on my mind (Money)
Used to think about you all the time
Even though you never were my type
I almost let you go and kill my vibe
My life's richer now (Money)
Ever since you left the picture now
Baby, I've been better by myself
With money on, money my mind (Money)
I'd rather rely on dollar signs (Money)
Money on my, money on my1Embed
