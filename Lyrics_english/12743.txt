My Paper Heart Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can

[Verse 1]
Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that
I know moving on is
Easiest when I am around you
[Pre-Chorus]
So bottle up old love
And throw it out to sea
Watch it away as you cry
A year has passed
The seasons go

[Chorus 1]
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can

[Verse 2]
Waiting, day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer

[Pre-Chorus]
So bottle up old love
And throw it out to sea
Watch it away as you cry
A year has passed
The seasons go
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can

[Chorus 2]
Summer time, the nights are so long
The leaves fall down and so do I into the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me
Summer time, the nights are so long
The leaves fall down and so do I into the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me3Embed
