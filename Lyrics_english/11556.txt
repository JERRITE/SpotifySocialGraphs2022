Bite the Hand Lyrics[Verse 1: Lucy Dacus]
I can't hear you, you're too far away
I can't see you, the light is in my face
I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could

[Refrain: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker]
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

[Verse 2: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker]
Here's the best part, distilled for you
But you want what I can't give to you
Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied
[Refrain: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker]
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

[Bridge: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
What do you want to say?
What do you think will change?
Maybe I'm afraid of you
Maybe I'm afraid of you
I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand

[Refrain: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker]
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
