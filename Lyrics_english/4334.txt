Tell me Lyrics ["Tell me" letter]]

[Verse 1]
Tell me that I am all ears
Tell me how many times have you lost
How many times have you let you go
Or when you have been the one you have gone
I promise you that I stay with you
When we spend heat or go cold
Thanks to you I feel blessed
And these eyes are no longer so fallen
Tell me all your dreams and your nightmares
In detail, if you look capable
I listen silently, I look like shine
My best home definition
[Chorus]
And tell me
Don't skip anything, tell me
I'm going to listen to everything without judging you
And tell me
Luеgo a song will write you
That everyone can be able to get excited
And tell me
Don't skip anything, tell me
I'm going to listen to everything without judging you
And tell me
Then a song will write you
That all can be sing to him—

[Verse 2]
Tell me what makes you happy
The times you have not stopped laughing
I promise you I'm not going to go without you
This life is pa 'both, we just have to live
I will also tell you the deepest of me
My greatest fears, my insecurity
But I must say that from you are here
There are things that do not stop improving
And tell me your triumphs, all your facets
I my ambitions, tell me your goals
Kiss my face, remove this mask
And tell the stars not to wait for me awake
Tell me your sorrows, all your problems
I will tell you the things that burn me inside
Let's sit down and talk about everything we have left
What are you going to be my muse for more than one million issues
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
And tell me, your smells and preferred flavors
To 'the plans you want to do with me
I will also tell you my goals
To 'the plans that I want to make with you
Tell me tell me
Tell me tell me

[Chorus]
And tell me
Don't skip anything, tell me
I'm going to listen to everything without judging you
And tell me
Then a song will write you
That everyone can be sing to get excited
And tell me
Don't skip anything, tell me
I'm going to listen to everything without judging you
And tell me
Then a song will write you
That all can be sing for
