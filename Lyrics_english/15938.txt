Really loving lyrics [verse 1: karmen]
That your perfume impregnated in me stays
That tonight's memory remains intact
That the moon is condue and do not let you go
Don't spend a day away from my side

[Pre-car]
That checks the universe that can be conspired
That if we want what is what is can happen
That there are no impossible to love
[Chorus]
No, it can't be more
Our clumsiness when creating an incomplete story
No, I don't think once again
You close the door and take my soul undone
Tell me because you don't risk really loving

[Verse 2: Silvia]
Although not feeling was the deal and swear to fulfill
I couldn't help falling from you in love
And if the moon is built and does not let you go
I promise to never get away from your side

[Pre-car]
That checks the universe that can be conspired
That if we want what is what is can happen
That there are no impossible for loving

[Chorus]
No, it can't be more
Our clumsiness when creating an incomplete story
No, I don't think once again
You close the door and take my soul undone
Tell me because you don't risk

[Chorus]
No, it can't be more
Our clumsiness when creating an incomplete story
No, I will never let you go
Something tells me that you and I will be happy
Let's heal our scars to really love
