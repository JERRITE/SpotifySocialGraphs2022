Youâ€™re the Reason (Acoustic Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna make a scene, I don't wanna let you down
Try to do my own thing, and I'm starting to figure it out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That it's alright, keep it together wherever we go
And it's alright, oh well, whatever
Everybody needs to know

[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now, no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why
[Verse 2]
I don't even care when they say you're "a little bit off"
Look 'em in the eye, I'd say, "I could never get enough"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause it's alright, keep it together wherever we go
And it's alright, oh well, whatever
Everybody needs to know

[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now, no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why

[Bridge]
If it was raining, you would yell at the sun
Pick up the pieces when the damage is done
You say, "It's just another day in the shade"
Look at what a mess we made

[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now, no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why

I don't wanna make a scene, I don't wanna let you downEmbed
