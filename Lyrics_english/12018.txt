Are U Live Lyrics[Intro: Valee]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus: Choir and Valee]
Oh, you live (Yup), lit (Yup), loud (Yup)
Dirty (Yup), clothes (Yup), hamper (Hey), tramp (Yup), study (Hey)
Fold (What?), rock it (Yeah), yeah (Hey), yeah (Yeah)
It's an Audi, zoom-zoom, ZZs, nap
Hit it, stamp, lean, frap (Hey)
Nasty, yeah (Woah), uh-oh, snap (Ayy)
Back back, tap (Hey), bitch, this slap (Woah)
Handshake, what's that? Dap (Dap)
[Verse 1: Valee, Jeremih, & Chance the Rapper]
Fuck with my 12s, Wisconsin Dells
What about you? Yeah, fucked a masseuse, yeah
Fucked that bitch and send her right back to you
Chunk up the deuce
Been pulled the trigger, I've been that nigga
Yeah
Ooh, I'm with my lil' man, I'm with the zoo
With the wood in my ear, made the roof disappear (Woo)
Fucked that bitch to Erykah Badu, haha, yeah
Used to rock Havana Joe boots
I'm sorta bougie, but I'm not a bitch
You got the goose, but it's not a Givenchy
I swear, my palms, they be itching
You rocking braids, that shit is different
Do Versace, look through the shades
She lucked out with me, call us up in the kitchen
I mix the lean with apple juice
She off a bean, she wanna juke
She don't want water, she don't want food
Still no chaser? (Ooh)
Mexican booth, I bought some fruit
Elephant tooth
Look what I bought, regular suit
Grammys, I'm smoking that Pep√© Le Pew

[Verse 2: Valee & Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
At Mariano's, I got the pooch
I got the loot, eatin' good, yeah
At Mariano's, I got my pooch
I got the puppy, I got the pump
Thanks to the mailman, I got the dump
I hit a lick, didn't touch a tongue
I got blue huns, separate the ones
Take it to Chase, facin' a blunt
Fogo De Chao, that was for lunch
I'm tryna dunk, skip to my lou
Check in my bed, checkin' my suit
Fuck that bitch twice, that's deja vu
Fuck on a journalist, she want the scoop
Now she do the news
Black diamonds, I'm on the slopes
My baby need a new coat
I'ma slide to River Oaks
Auntie Annie's when I walk through the door
Magic picture, man, I'm chargin' for photos
I need me some bread, I need me some bread
Niggas salty, man, that's all they gon' throw
I need me some prez, preferably dead
Remember the block is hot
My Pioneer shake the block
Oh, a little bit off the top
Please Calvin, don't sell the shop
Ice cubes in my eggnog
Ms. Claus in them red drawers
Shit, who do you think you are?
Bitch, you giving a TedTalk?
