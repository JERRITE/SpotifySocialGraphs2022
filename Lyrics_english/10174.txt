Trashfire Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Hands pressed to your thighs as if you could protect them
From the thoughts that you've had that conspire against them
Even though you need them to get by
Last chance to be a kid with a cereal box
Had a dream in your head but you woke up and lost it
And you only get a few more candles
Before you're too old to try again
To be a wreck
To get the sympathy of friends who see that you're not there yet
But they say that you'll get there
[Chorus]
And then all of a sudden, you're a bad liar
'Cause you said that it would get better
But all of a sudden, it's a trashfire
And you can't put it out, can't put it out
All of a sudden, you're a hostage
To things you thought you wanted
All of a sudden, you're a hot mess
And you can't sweat it out, can't sweat it out
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Gets tough being young
But you do it for kicks
Kinda hate how it tastes
But you eat it with chopsticks
Existentialist
You wanna know what all of this is
Four more months
It's just a season
Cut your loss
You'll start to think that
Things you have are things you'll lose
It's normal but it's not the truth

[Chorus]
And all of a sudden, you're a bad liar
'Cause you said that it will get better
But all of a sudden, it's a trashfire
And you can't put it out, can't put it out
All of a sudden, you're a hostage
To things you thought you wanted
All of a sudden, you're a hot mess
And you can't sweat it out, can't sweat it out
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You might also like[Outro]
And all of a sudden, you're a bad liar
All of a sudden, you're a trashfire
But if anybody treats you like a hazard
You're the one with your thumb on the lighterEmbed
