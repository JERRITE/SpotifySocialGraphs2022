In the slow lyrics [lyrics of "in the slow"]

[Pre-Caro: Farruko, Cosculluela]
I wear the combi, I bathe my perfume
My technomarine endiamanta'o, uoh
Much Penny Way in my chain that presumes
The cats worship me (the main), without me give wings (Farruko)
Easy I win comfortable, even if they throw me bad
(Let's go, eat on! Come on!)

[Chorus: Farruko, Cosculluela]
I leave chilling in the slow (Ye-Yeah)
Chavos, a lot of dress (cash)
Cats, I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me rent
I leave chilling in the slow one (too much 'a lot' tickets)
Chavos, a lot of clothing
Cats, I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me rent
[Verse 1: cosculluela]
(I'm coming in, nigga, Yeh)
Yes-if this were a kiosk I was a bugote, you shooters
Upload the volume you are listening to the best
Nor do they treat it, because it will not be like us
I Potro, that this is not Supermotos League
This is from a melon up and welcome to the sect
Hayabusa puts 240 on the line
The cats stick to me because I have the lettuce
Pa 'go cruise to' the year pa 'aruba, you feel me?
That's My Life (Okay), I'm waiting outside 'e vice
With the combo, my cat and forty-five
Crazy because you get out of the projects
The artist, Blanca Nieves, the insects (BRR)

[Chorus: Farruko, Cosculluela]
I leave chilling in the slow (Young Murda ')
Chavos, a lot of dress (too much)
Cats, I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me rent
I leave chilling in the slow, kids, a lot of clothing
Cats, I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me rent

[Verse 2: cosculluela]
(Tell me lolo)
I'm in the new yores', heating blocks, don't bliss
I erase you 'the seal for mine are placed
Twenty-four-Siete-Siete with to 'the guys
Las Mercedes with Cabinet System, Homeboy
I don't use bling, I don't get na ', I'm always clever
Chambea'o the Spring, circling your gallerin '
The BMW, cold like Iglus
Crazy about catching you and to 'your crew, Young Murda'
Gatas in Miami, Gatas in Medallo
I Gallo, Sing and collapse the macaw
Do not forget that we control the land
A skating and we put you brake, I Farru

I put the combi, I bathe in perfume (quiet)
My technomarine endiamanta'o, uoh
Much Penny Way in my chain that presumes (hey)
The cats worship me, without me give wings
Easy I win comfortable, even if they throw me bad
(Teaching these boys how he walks)

[Chorus: Farruko]
I leave chilling in the slow
Chavos, a lot of clothing
I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me the rent (cash)
I leave chilling in the slow
Chavos, a lot of clothing
I already lost account
If this were a kiosk you pay me rent

[Outro: Cosculluela, Farruko]
Pussy, crazy, but I don't understand these people
They are always talking about brands and things
But, pussy, what about what?
Is that the one who does not spend always has
My brother is Mosquea'o (hahaha)
Farruko
The principle, cosculluela
You know that this is worldwide, my brother
We run 'the kiosko
You enclose tighten and to 'those things
'Good?
Urba, Rome, the Evo Jedis
