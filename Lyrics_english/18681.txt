The Beatings Will Continue (Until Morale Improves) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another day, another riot
Another fire lighted
Has got you feeling down
They're coming with the cure
And demanding that you try it
I hear it’s the talk of the town
A little PMA through pepper spray
To put a little joy right in your day
Bringing cheer in riot gear
All you gotta do is obey
[Verse 2]
All the rank and file
Take their beatings and smile
As they cross your names off the list
Welcome to the fold
With a chokehold
Preach to the flock with a fist
Sunny days will dawn
At the end of a baton
Turn grey skies black and blue
Remedy the mood
With a blood feud
Here's what you gotta do

[Chorus]
Smile at all the beatings
All the punches and the greetings
All the blows and the bleeding
Until you like it
Smile at being battered
All the bones being shattered
All the blood being splattered
Until you like it
Rejoice in all the horror
Until you can't ignore her
And you revel in disorder
Soon you’ll like it
Grin at the abuse
You've got nothing left to lose
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves

[Guitar Solos]

[Chorus]
Smile at all the beatings
All the punches and the greetings
All the blows and the bleeding
Until you like it
Smile at being battered
All the bones being shattered
All the blood being splattered
Until you like it
Rejoice in all the horror
Until you can't ignore her
And you revel in disorder
Soon you'll like it
Grin at the abuse
You've got nothing left to lose

[Outro]
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves
The beatings will continue
Until morale improvesEmbed
