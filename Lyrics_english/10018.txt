[Intro]
*lighter flick*

[Pre-Chorus]
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in the chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
[Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

[Verse]
You got me so turnt up, this dude got a bitch so high
Weed always on my mind, now he always on my mind
Doja, know you want some of this purr (*meowing*)
You ain't gotta say a word, just spark that, let's get burnt
Ah, then we'll roll up a hundred fuckin' blunts
All up in my mouth, now I'm all up in yo' *meowing*
This nigga got pounds of it all up in his trunk
Now we both look Asian, he wavin' and I'm drunk
I got dank shit in my cup, you know what I'ma do to you
I could get real used to you, blow, weed, X
And we sippin' on that juicy-juice, that's just what she choose to do
Oh, man, this shit these drugs will do to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in the chest
When you put it on me you relieve my stress
You got me so high, takin' deep, deep breaths
You might also like[Chorus]
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
I know you ain't a drug, but you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high
You get me so high, you get me so high, high

[Outro]
