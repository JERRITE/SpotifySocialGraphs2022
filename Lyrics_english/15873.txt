Who loves you like me Lyricsquien loves her like me
Linda or Pope Chiquilla
Who loves her like me
Pretty girl or her breast
So what is thinking
And avenge here
Well here with me has
Much love Papa and Mama
Well here with me has
Much love Papa and Mama
Imagine my queen
What can enjoy daddy
Friday saturday and sunday
And when you want to go dance
When you want to travel
I also just enjoy it
If you get married with me
I will be dad and you mama
If you get married with me
I will be dad and you mama

And if he marries me
I buy everything you want
And when the baby is born
I put raised and also babysitter
And I will only give me yets that love me
What loves me
And I will only give me yets that love me
What loves me

How beautiful my little girl
I love her very much and you see it
Just as I love her
You must also love me
We go for a walk
Wherever I want to take it
If he marries me
Like a baby I will take care of her
If he marries me
Like a baby I will take care of her
You Might Also Likey if I had problems
With his brothers and his potatoes
Well, I take it very far
And every day I will love her more
I think it's time
Tell your family that you are already doing
After that with Papi
Cute little things will learn
I think it's time
Tell your family that you are already doing
After that with Papi
Cute little things will learn
And I will only give me yets that love me
For me love me
