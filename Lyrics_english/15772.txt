Behind my Lyricsya window I got tired
Don't caress me or look
To be in your bed a third pillow
To see that the future is becoming skinny
And knowing that life is nothing more than a while
Oh, feel a woman because I wash the dishes

Oh, I got tired
To say that I love you and see that you are asleep
To make you a special dinner and see that you have gone
Of being a housewife and nothing more
With the difference of always and never
And even feel happy when you're leaving
Behind my window I see the morning pass
Waiting for the night I uncovered the neckline
So that this causes your failed anxiety
Behind my window, I see the destination disguised as a murderer
Mocking laughter of this ungrateful concubine

Behind my window my life goes
With you but alone

I got tired
To be for you like any shirt
That is iron and wrinkled with your laughter
To be another object in your home
Like a rag, a chair, a simple cup
And that you don't even find out what happens

Behind my window, I see the morning spend
Waiting for the night I uncovered the neckline
So that this causes your failed anxiety
Behind my window I see to go to the destination disguised as a murderer
Mocking laughter of this ungrateful concubine

Behind my window, my life goes
With you but alone
