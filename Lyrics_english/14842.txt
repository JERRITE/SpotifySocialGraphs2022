All lyrics [Verse 1: Assono]
Still present with my dirty Net Pas team, it varies, several facets, a MIC between the phalanges, that's how it leaves the planet
It was fixed a big challenge, is a question of being yourself and from the start to the end of the exchange must be the same
Make the tactic that I am growing, send me the beat that I am mismanous, safely, I see that there will vibrate in the arenas
When it kicks nothing more, if I'm sadistic on the model, it is because a white bales made me easy from the gachette
So much I run, and I come from the Saldef parking lot, a beautiful style but not enough to make a bunch of clips with women
So much so that it is even putty in my bowl, it is impossible that I bring one to the plastic in the udders
Dirty titles, dirty texts, artists, dirty beasts, I am not often heard but know that classic are my reminders
There I arrive, you salivate, when I 19ch the material, I am expected at the turn and there is all my clique in the shuttle

[Verse 2: POZ]
If I have no rhymes it doesn't matter, it's not enough to have done 20 years of rap to say that the classic is palpable
And agitated and it calms, it's doubtful when you kick, I do the fire without the public of Johnny Halliday in Cannes
Yeah the atmosphere is freezing, for frosty guys, it curdles, I see them salivate the cam but I am jerking off I don't like that
Between my all man, I can validate you sharing, before you try to pluck us, we will have gone from the cage
Without light from the moon I can because in the night I have no flagship and because of the tune, the friend, we are addicts and stingy
I want the hard drive, that the memory does not fade, it is vicious but with each spliff of the phases leave
In the plumard I am quickly attended since I am abuse of pastis and caviar, I get the hair of the beast if you have fun saying that I have no beard
Do not do this, do not do that, nick your advice, in concert the walls vibrate to detap your room
[Verse 3: Aksang]
I have practice, I adapt, when you arrive with friends the price is the massacre
We handle the rhyme, Maasai technique, go ahead, we take out the petroleum jelly after massage
I have cries of barbarian, all embittered I run, I don't like it when I say that I have written everything
I was able to flee there, but I did not drop all my rhymes, under the inspiration I write three pages
We refine the work, then calls the ambulance, as an atmosphere we push macaque cries
Are not afraid we are advocating in the din, but we are not talking about rappers, the thing would be macabre
Enjoy the flavor, forget your pasta dish, come and judge the value of the low -end MC's
We disembark, we castagne, bastard, you may have a bastard, there are no seats break you

[Verse 4: Caccio]
Concrete block on the skull, the friends barbarized, violence is commonplace
It lives in dependence and then it cannabise, water flowed under the bridges but which channels it?
2012, we all expected cataclysm, by dint of swallowing their bullshit the people gargare
And in their safaris is agitated, hip-hop is dying, I see lots of actresses, no artists
Between Salafists, dirty fascists, anarchists, elections and always the same themes on their dirty posters
My bastards pollute the air without catalytic pots, smoke sdars, more XXX than a Qatari
Around me everything is advancing, rapist rap, there is shape but the background is secret #karachi
It's shot, violent, what is it cous' we haven't told you? The friend Cash, present at all party bastards

[Verse 5: Yul]
Ok heats the team, we are speed, collective kiff and the kick and good trip, late session in full
Artists we are, that the jealous jactent we are all bastards I'm talking about it but not to say to the condes
Complete, like the break that drives me, founded, my decisions are unanimous, intimate, I like to confide
My words I handle, humanist drive I was nesting against their lives, lively but who trust
To the rhythm of their nonsense, naive, I write my life hoping that it brings you out and it is better that than an empty art or pumped
They will tell you about business, falsely artistic silver, will teach you with vice and beautiful booted breasts
Yes what is done is rap, conflicts of lasting thoughts, to tell the truth to lose or even a penny from
Indomple, the void is hard to do, a tough business, I am so in my streets so low, for me it's just possible to go back

When I get down it's too late little hen, you just have to give you elsewhere, the rhyme of the brassor spreads quickly for
Make damage, proud to bury your guys, shit I lose the pedals, go back up your flower flow then move
I place one for the botaniks crew, all my bastards, I want fachos to leave there it is normal if I open
A 'Boukha Teille and I feel less alone, standing to win by being victorious far from the big' cups that are used
At the microphone just a zonard who suffers, come and contest our phases, it's a shame there it is our phases that go
It's too easy I find it, dirty asshole I wick everything, you wanted to lose you offshore but you're just a tocard that comes to
In my city it is the storm, that coa lines, and my life is How High, when there is cellophane it is my tos-ma
Success makes us walk I see unemployment that runs, wait it's heartbreaking it's not lucky but big sdarsqui are turning

[Verse 7: Hermano Salvatore]
Hermano Salvatore, this is my rhyme that I pilot, my bastards on board, far from ignoble artists
But that we practice and innovates, whole guys, not rentiers, because in real has been 10 rods that we activate hip-hop
The friend you spent your youth in cannabis and picole, that's it you have founded your home and is that you are so strong is so strong
We are not going to read the Discordes, you know everything is ephemeral, it is when you believe your life built that it happens to you from the odds and ends
I know, it's not to laugh but laughs, you have charisma and you are not worthy on your CV but you have weadowed diplomas
The heart of bruising, there you tired, you avoid family meals in the middle of a bad trip yeah you traffic and isoles
Fire in the ass, the kids set up, worse that will be enough to make buzz #paris hilton
You want supposedly, you want flow, theme, come see us or tell me, apart from my click who else

[Verse 8: Tetris Syzif]
Appreciate the technique, the same rhyme all along, we arrive as a team, warned everyone
We will be, a poto finds the name (what is it? All bastards) one day our songs will run
It is for the values of hip-hop that we come, is it for the Kiff? Yes, what is things moving? Nope
No glasses of water, the Fr√©rots get drunk, it flies not very high, with each aperitif I touch the bottom
With a bunch of friends we spam for good, you don't care I'm not naive, your friends will double me
Critics, explicit lyrics, the victims of ministers end up under the bridge
Feel the diff ', as soon as the curtains open, we invade while the rivals are suited the ass
I have to raise the level or tone, eh yo I will put the microphone, cut the sound
[Verse 9: Lamanif]
My life is sex, drugs and a bunch of other supplies, rotting, there would be time for me to have sounds for iTunes
I don't read anymore, I can barely read, son the guys of your playlist have all the balls that
There are not many outcome, it is truly pregnant, I always jerk off with a piece of fabric
We screw up your ass, a real fistery, for all these sons of wealthy would be necessary to get me with stings
Very far from the shots, I have the dick that drips on the competition, I give the fire so that the groupies sweat
There's just a whole little thing that grieves me, we get you down to each rhyme son, we are a group that kills
Their sounds have a taste of frying, that they go to their mothers and then that they take their shit for food
I have sex always so hard, go to do this elsewhere, you don't know my bastards but damn where do you live?

[Outro]
But where do you live? But where fucking you? But where fucking you? 2EMBED
