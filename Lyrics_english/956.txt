Wild Lyrics [Wild "Letter"]

[Chorus: Elvis Crespo]
Wild, I tie you and put the bandage
So that your mind does not record what happens
I grab you and we watched us' on a trip, savage
Wild, I tie you and put the bandage
So that your mind does not record what happens
I grab you and we watched us' on a trip, wild (oooh)

[Verse 1: Messiah]
She likes it hard, She likes the pain
I grab his hair, She's Screaming My Name
Shawty you know, yeah, you drive me insane
Alone at home and I want to eat you
Cale, my love
I will do it as nobody has done it to you, no (ay)

[Pre-car: Messiah]
I woke up the neighbor '
In the morning repeated '
Mommy, tell my house
I want with you tonight
I woke up the neighbor '
In the morning repeated '
Mommy, tell my house
I want with you tonight

[Choir: Elvis Crespo, Elvis Crespo & Messiah the artist]
Wild, I tie you and put the bandage
So that your mind does not record what happens
I grab you and we watched us' on a trip, savage
Wild, I tie you and put the bandage
So that your mind does not record what happens
I grab you and we watched us' on a trip, savage

And caress how nobody has ever done it
Baby girl i know you're looking for a savage, a savage
When you want to do it, mommy, call me

[Pre-car: Messiah]
I woke up the neighbor '

I woke up the neighbor '
In the morning repeated '
Mommy, tell my house
