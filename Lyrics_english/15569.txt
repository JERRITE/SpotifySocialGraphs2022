Save me lyrics [verse 1: Anahí]
missing You is My need
Live in despair
Since you don't come back anymore

[Saying: Anahí]
Survive for pure anxiety
With the knot in the throat
And I don't stop thinking

[Pre-stribe: Anahí]
Little by little the heart
Losing faith
Losing the voice
[Chorus: Anahí & Rbd]
Save me from oblivion
Save me of lonely
Save me from the boredom
I am made at your will
Save me from oblivion
Save me from darkness
Save me from the boredom
Do not ever let me fall

[Verse 2: Anahí]
I propose so much to continue
But love is the word
That it costs me sometimes to forget

[Saying: Anahí]
Survive for pure anxiety
With the knot in the throat
And I don't stop thinking

[Pre-stribe: Anahí]
Little by little the heart
Losing faith
Losing the voice

[Chorus: Anahí & Rbd]
Save me from oblivion
Save me of lonely
Save me from the boredom
I am made at your will
Save me from oblivion
Save me from darkness
Save me from the boredom
Do not ever let me fall

[Outro: RBD]
Save me from oblivion
Save me from the boredom
