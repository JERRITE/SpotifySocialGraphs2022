Keep a Blixky Lyrics[Chorus]
Keep a blicky, 'cause I cannot die young
Rather get caught up wit my gun
One in the head, why would I run?
Don't come outside you ain't got one
I done came a long way from them lineups
You can't complain, once you sign up
Hella shooters they all in designer
Get the addy, we spinnin' and find 'em

[Verse 1]
Louis, Amiri, shorty said she ain't tryna fuck with no nigga that's scary
I keep it near me, I know some hatin' niggas wanna see me get buried
Niggas better not spare me, he gon' get left if he think that he movin' too leary
Whole lotta blicks in thе function my steppers gon' up it them clips wе be dumpin'
Soon as he slip we gon' brush 'em, fuck it, faceshot they gotta rush 'em
Can't let my mama love bury me, can't show remorse to the enemies
Murder way more than a felony, I'm facin' life they was tellin me
I lost 3 how the fuck I'ma let it be, free the blickys, the feds came did a sweep
Keep one eye open when I sleep, cus it ain't no love out here in these streets
Hoodie on tight, spinnin in a jeep, catch em man down then we flee the scene
Last opper we caught had to pop 'em, shouldn't've left out his crib without knockers
He was dissin' in songs had to drop 'em, if it's snipers we hoppin out poppin'
[Chorus]
Keep a blicky, 'cause I cannot die young
Rather get caught up wit my gun
One in the head, why would I run?
Don't come outside you ain't got one
I done came a long way from them lineups
You can't complain, once you sign up
Hella shooters they all in designer
Get the addy, we spinnin' and find 'em

[Verse 2]
I bet folks up the blicks when it's drama
You ain't never get picked in a lineup
I done been through a whole lotta trauma
High speed, RIP [?]
Told them folks he ain't dead then reverse it
He was talkin' too tough in his verses
Get the drop and we gotta go merc' him
Ain't gon make it his blood keep on squirtin'
Tell my taliban tighten up his turban
Put that boy in a box, hearse him
They sent a shooter but that nigga miss 'cause he nervous
How the fuck homie a killer he never put work in?
Stand over opps, headshot, then we close the curtain

[Chorus]
Keep a blicky, 'cause I cannot die young
Rather get caught up wit my gun
One in the head, why would I run?
Don't come outside you ain't got one
I done came a long way from them lineups
You can't complain, once you sign up
Hella shooters they all in designer
Get the addy, we spinnin' and find 'emYou might also likeEmbed
