Hate Über Alles Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never asked to be reborn
Or submit unto their norm
Don't you ever tell me how to live my life
For rebellion I am armed
All my senses are alarmed
Decimate this mental breed that I despise
For this system I can't trust
In these ruins of arrogance
My saviors are destroyers to some
[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand with both my hands untied

[Chorus]
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate übеr alles
Hate is the virus of this world
Hatе über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world

[Verse 2]
I'm a wanderer of the storm
Live to win, not follow, bow
I'm an entity on a human journey
For my Reich's not of this world
I reject the empires gold
For the purest liberty, my heart is yearning
No distraction, no regrets
Slay the guardians at the gates
For this cult was never meant to compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand with both my hands untied
You might also like[Chorus]
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world

[Bridge]
I don't see what they see
I don't believe what they believe
Whatever comes, I am fearless
I don't want what they want
I hold my ground right at the front
My hate, they shall feel it
They shall feel it

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate über alles
Hate is the virus of this world1Embed
