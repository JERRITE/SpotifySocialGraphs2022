What would have been Lyrics [letter of "what would have been"]

[Verse 1: Olga]
I saw you today and I couldn't talk to you
We know that it is no longer the same
Today maybe, you can understand
We never chose the end

[Pre-Caro: Natalia]
It was time who said "maybe"
And it is not true that I stopped loving you
[Chorus: Juliana & Makis]
What would have been?
If you had never left
What would have been?
If time were our friend
If we had left everything aside
If we had insisted
What would have been?
If you hadn't fired

[Verse 2: Camila]
I saw you today, I didn't know what to say
I don't know how to hide (I don't know how to hide)
Today maybe, I have to understand
I can never forget you

[Pre-Caro: Natalia]
It was time who said "maybe"
And it is not true that I stopped loving you

[Chorus: Juliana & Makis]
What would have been?
If you had never left
What would have been?
If time were our friend
If we had left everything aside
If we had insisted
What would have been?
If you hadn't fired

OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH
If you hadn't fired
OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH
Hmm

[Chorus: Camila, all, Natalia & Makis]
What would have been?
If you had never left
What would have been?
If time were our friend
If we had left everything aside (aside)
If we had insisted
What would have been?
If you hadn't fired

[Outro: Olga]
I saw you today and I couldn't talk to you
We know that it is no longer the same2embed
