I don't need you (it was never necessity) Lyricsno I need you, I can live without you
Without you I think and breathe and where to sail
But what sense is not that I need you
I love you with me

It is not life or death, it shouldn't be like that
I can be happy on another shore without hesitation
But if this is in my hands
I know it's not a matter of luck
I love you with me
It is no necessity what I feel is not a necessity
It's just that I know that being with you
I feel good
And I can be myself

It is not a necessity, ours was never necessity
It was always a matter of sharing
To do well and talk to us in the ear

I don't need you or want to die for you
I have the reasons for walking this path
But what sense is, I saw you among so many people
And I want to walk with you

It is not crazy dependence is not irrational
Not that the world is over because you are not
It is to give each other naturally
It is a double track, is to give and receive
If I ever missed I could continue
But it's my decision
Stay with you

It is not necessity
What I feel is not a need
It's just that I know that being with you feels good to me
And I can be myself
You Might Also Likeno is necessity, ours was never a need

And talk to us in the ear

No, it is not a necessity, ours was never necessity
No, it is not a necessity, ours was never necessity
I don't need you
