So We Remain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see the moon at night
Reminds me of the times I cried
Where you held me so tight that I
Felt your heartbeat in my bones

[Chorus]
But now it's too late
There's much too much for both of us to say
We'd never do it justice anyway
How do you know when to walk away?
So we remain
[Verse 2]
Call me your woman one last time
Keep the night from meeting sunrise
And can you hold me so tight that I
Feel your heartbeat in my bones

[Chorus]
Even though it's too late
There's much too much for both of us to say
We'd never do it justice anyway
How do you know when to walk away?
So w–µ remain

[Outro]
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, laYou might also likeEmbed
