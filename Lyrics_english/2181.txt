TranslationsEspa√±olOnce Upon A Dream Lyrics[Verse]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, mmm
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
