Rockyâ€™s Late Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Darker side, where you no longer have a right
I fear what I'll do tonight
Can't decide, does everybody feel alright?
I made a mistake tonight
My left side companion, enjoys when we're not polite
He leaves me stranded when we get confronted by right

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm not the same as I was before
Oh, I'm not the same as I was before
[Chorus]

What wasn't mine to take, I took in double-time
Out of perfection, nothing can be made
What must be broken down is left to rearrange

[Verse 2]

What was your question? I can't seem to fill the blank
Watch as I begin a sentence that I can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the same as I was before
Oh, I'm not the same as I was before

[Chorus]
There is an emptiness that I cannot describe
What was another take, I took in double-time
I lack perfection, nothing can be made
What must be broken now is left to rearrange

[Refrain]
