God Says No LyricsFiring my friend
But I come back again and again
I just can't pretend
One more step and I'll start to bend
Yeah

You try and live
And God says no

We go on our way
Just a-waiting for that lucky day
I tried every way
Just so that God can blow me away
Yeah
I need some love
To start the show
But ask just once
And God says no

A line of dust slides through my head
And scary thoughts like wishing we were dead
You won't get caught if you don't get queer
And you'll be ready for a new frontier

It's good to be bad
It's the best time you'll ever have
What the hell is this ultra sad?
Pray for your cool and work on that ass, yes

You learn too much
You'll never know
Just start to laugh
And God says no

A point of life flies through my head
A scary thought like I was someone else
And don't get lost now and show no fear
And you'll be ready for a new frontier
A line of dust slides through my head
And scary thoughts like wishing we were dead
You won't get caught if you don't get queer
And you'll be ready for a new frontier

Mmm, for a new frontier

For a new frontier
For a new frontier
For a new frontier
Yeah, for a new frontier1Embed
