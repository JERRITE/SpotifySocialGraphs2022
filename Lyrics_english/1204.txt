TranslationsEspa√±olBO$$ Lyrics[Intro]
Woah! Woah!

[Verse 1: Normani]
Every day is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the Nae Nae
You're talking to a lady
I want a Kanye-ye, not a Ray J
So that's a no-no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-e
I already know whatcha tryna say
[Pre-Chorus: Lauren & Camila]
You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Working for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
[Chorus: Normani, All]
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars
Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, getting Oprah dollars

[Verse 2: Normani]

Don't want yo compliments, use common sense
I'm on my Michelle Obama (Shhh)
Shut your mouth
Boy, I think you know who run this house
I ain't thirsting for no bae
'Cause I already know whatcha tryna say
