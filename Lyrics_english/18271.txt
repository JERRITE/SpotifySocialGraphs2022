Amplified Plus Lyrics[Verse]
First off let me pull the rari out
You them niggas that go way out
Weighing on the 'caine I pull a caper
So I can pull a motherfucking caper
This ain't no freestyle chamber
Rock rap most of you chumps
Got that juice and got that pump
Hoes back there ass up and dump
Past shit older than Donald Trump
Wow who else got the drive
While in this beat Im Amplified
When I say that it means I gotta ride
Do you really need Kay Dolla $ign
Or do you need Bootlegg Jones or D-Cide
This is what I mean the whole crew gone AWOL
New discussion you don't have to call
I just download a mixtape by Paul Wall
And have the whole Crew loving
Self made kid and Im appreciative
We don't hold anything back I am in lead
Im professional like play in the league
Damn I grab the mic and guitar
We about Seconds to go take it far
Spaced out kid Im the Earth you are just mars
Migos Takeoff My Offset like Quavo
Im Number one Cheeseburger with Mayo
Blow my High when I say Ayo
Got the fame from when I fucked up the show
Im about E-40 he tells me when to go
There  is no turning back to the Fo'
But by the end I would be lovin these hoes
You Pussies can't test me when I already succeed
[Outro]
You know there is the gangsta on the phone
Im a rockstar in this bitch, boy
We in this bitch, boy
Go Kay have at it
Amplified right here
Stick to the script you stuck at the moment
Its me vs the hometown no opponentYou might also likeEmbed
