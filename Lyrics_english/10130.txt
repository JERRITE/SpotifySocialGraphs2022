FWM Lyrics[Intro]
Hey I'm Flamey

[Verse 1]
This takes all of me
I can't help but to be free
I just need to know what's real
Reality be calling me still
But them diamonds in my mouth so trill
I just need to know one thing for real
[Chorus]
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Bitch I've been living lovely
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Bitch I've been living lovely

[Post-Chorus]
Finally I grew some wings and flew away
I'm smoking better dank red eyes behind designer shades
So I can't see a thing, bitch I don't wanna feel a thing
I'm switching, swerving lanes and rolling up that stanky stank
(That stanky stank)

[Verse 2]
I don't really fuck with fugazis
These little bitches, they pay me
Trappin' and stackin' it lately
[?]
Can't let this fuckery faze me
You'd be afraid to just face me

[Chorus]
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Bitch I've been living lovely
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Do you really fuck with me?
Bitch I've been living lovely
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Finally I grew some wings and flew away
I'm  smoking better dank red eyes behind designer shades
So I can't see a thing
Bitch I don't wanna feel a thing
I'm switching, swerving lanes
And rolling up that stanky stank
(That stanky stank)

[Outro]
This shit gets so fucking real somehow
All this dope got my lungs filled with clouds
Think I ain't 'bout that shit come find out
Get the fuck from me with all that doubt2Embed
