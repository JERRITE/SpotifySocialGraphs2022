Sohber. LyricsHaven't called you up
Haven't heard your voice
You don't want to leave
But just know you have a choice

It's getting a little closer
It's coming to the end
I know you say you love me
But please, just don't pretend
I just don't think it's fair
For us to still be friends
You said that you would help me
But you've got no hands to lend
I'm love drunk and I'm sober
I'm counting down the days
Until I'm really over
And I fall back into your ways

I have nightmares about you
You haunt me in my sleep
You say that you hate me
And I wake up in deadly screams

I know this isn't real
And here's the reason why
As soon as things get hard
You leave without goodbye
You kept me going like a car
That runs on gas alone
But you threw me in the fire
Now I'm left with ash and coal

I'm love drunk and I'm sober
I'm counting down the days
Until I'm really over
And I fall back into your ways

I'm tired of you being pinned as my weakness
When I'm not pinned on the wall and your princess for the weekend
Attention and love are the same thing to ghosts
We've never gotten either so we get confused the most
You might also likeI'm love drunk and I'm sober
I'm counting down the days
Until I'm really over
And I fall back into your waysEmbed
