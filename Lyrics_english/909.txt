Lyrics devices [letter of "the devices"]

[Chorus: the alpha]
Me-me-I called me from Colombia and I 'vary' in a while
A Chuky of mine told me that the 'apparatus' arrived
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
(Me-me-I called Colombia and I 'vary' in a while
A Chuky of mine told me that the 'apparatus' arrived)
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
That the 'apparatus' arrived, that the 'apparatus' arrived
The 'apparatus' arrived, what the 'apparatus' arrived
The 'apparatus' arrived, what the 'apparatus' arrived
[Verse 1: the alpha]
Ah-ah
A-APARATE (apparatus)
You betrayed for money, here you did not ere 'pleasant
You ere 'a talkative, that knows me' ago
You do not move 'na', you 'tá friza'o like a portrait
LA DE'PEGO STREET (-PEGO)
Breaking the stage like McGregor's 'leg'
If you have 'thirty, you added what I have for'
Of woman 'of rd already' toy tired'o
That bring Filipina ', Uruguaya' and Panamanian '
The Dominican arrived with firewood
To 'are afraid of the Greña, the magic shows you
And you do not understand me or by sign ', Sign'
Moving the 'device', moving the 'device'
The one who plays my family I kill him
If the work 'tá well, gives the smell of the bowl of tail' and duck
I get the smell of above 'the plate
Give him pa'llá, give him pa'llá; I don't even stop you in Baní
That to the owner 'e lo' kilo 'le die'n tilín
Give him pa'llá, give him pa'llá; I don't even stop you in Baní
That to the owner 'e lo' kilo 'le die'n tilín (tilín, tilín)

They called me that they arrived, the pot left a long time (Yeh)
Up 'they crowned, with Gogo' I don't want to deal (wuh)
Row 'E Paketite', they say "White Gold"
If they touch the bank ', when they call they know they are so much' (ah, ah)
Do 'apparatus' on the wrist, do 'device' on the neck (cash)
New York sticks because there is 'that moves them'
Whoever is put on '(what?), Parce, what do you have'?
If your cat is not going to give the ass, of a Movemo '(Wuh)
CORONA'O-N'O-NA'O, LIKE ALFA AND LIL Pump (Pump)

'Tamo on high, changing the mind to the Menore'
Normal that the polygoma cry
It does not come, you get 'everything to me, I know that, I know that
Mamichula, come here if you want to know, if you want to know
I want the bruge to be lowered to the VIP, that everything is thirsty, that everything is thirsty
With the domi and with the Bori out there Copamo 'USA, Copamo' USA
