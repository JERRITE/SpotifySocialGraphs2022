Noses in Roses Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, would you believe it?
At long last the rain was finally gone
I just know the moment has come, I can feel it
Nothing but blue skies from here to God

[Chorus]
No more worries, baby
(No more worries)
Sayonara despair
(Goodbye despair)
[Interlude]
Ever gonna set it free?
Become what you ought to be?
When you gonna get it right?
Boy, you better live your life
Ever gonna set it free?
Become what you ought to be?
When you gonna get it right?
Boy, you better live your life
Ever gonna set it free?
Become what you ought to be?

[Verse 2]
Gonna have our noses in roses forever
Everybody's just, kind and fair
Every paper said and I quote
"Do believe it, all the news is good everywhere"

[Chorus]
No more worries, baby
(No more worries)
Arrivederci despair
(Goodbye despair)

[Bridge]
(No emotion)
(No emotion)
(No emotion)
(No emotion)
(No emotion)
Say, I'm not a toy that you can play with, dear
Though the sound is appealing
You're just a fly buzzing in my ear
As I'm dancing on the ceilin'
Elephants are crumbling down the bedroom door
And I can't stop them bleeding
You think you hit me with the kitchen sink?
There just ain't nothing here for stealing
God only knows just what I'm doing here
Babe, nobody knows
You think you taught me a lesson, babe
And think you "got through to me"
No one gets through anymore
