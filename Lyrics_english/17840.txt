Treeshin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Let me put my shit on do not disturb
I don't want nobody hittin' my shit right now (I see you DJ)
(Like, bro you know when you be killin' her, nigga)
Nine shots in the Ruger (And her leg shakin', like, Has-Hassy)
I just be wantin' to tell her, like, "Shake it, baby"

[Chorus]
Shake it, baby (Shake it, baby), I'm into treeshin' (Lord)
She gotta eat it (What? What?), then I might eat it (Mwah)
Out the gang, I'm the meanest (Hah)
If I call a demon (Empty the clip), ain't no question needed
Pull up, start clappin' that shit for no reason (Grr, bah, bah, bah)
[Verse 1]
She call my phone, like, "What do you want?" (Brr)
I got like three different opps in this blunt (Look)
I never call you 'cause you way too spoiled
But I need that pussy, it been like a month (I need it)
Ridin' around wit' the shh in the trunk (Skrrt)
We gon' be Gucci, the cito is tucked (Yeah, yeah)
I just been stitchin' and skrrtin' and dashin', reversin' (Skrrt, skrrt)
Our pressure too low in the front (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Don't give a fuck what they say about me (Nope)
Or what they gon' do to me (Hah), end up like the last opp
Get caught and get beat out your jewelry (Bah, bah, bah, bah)
Keep your chain tucked (Has-Hassy)
You better go get your name up (Yo)
I give all of these bitches the same fuck (Look)
I been gettin' money, I ain't change up (Ha)
They used to front on me back in the day
Now when they see me, it's, "Do you remember me?" (Okay)
Nigga, you phony, you act like you know me
When I come around, I ain't feelin' your energy (Fuck outta here)
Carry my homie, on court, I'm Ginobli
Pop up at your door like I came for deliveries (Skrrt, skrrt)
I hit it first, bro hit it second (Look)
We celebrate as a team, that's a victory (Ha, gang, gang)
S63, you can't see through the windows
I got 'em all black like I'm drivin' a limousine (Skrrt)
Mix the Givenchy, Amiri and DG
That shit go together like they been had chemistry
Bitch, I'm a thot, I don't know why you pickin' me
(Bitch, I'm a thot, I don't know why you pickin' me)
If you a thot, I won't bring up your history
(If you a thot, I won't bring up your history)

They said they tired of that waitin' (What?)
(Rah Swish, I'm gettin' impatient)
You never know what I'm thinkin' (Ha)
When you a boss, they do what you make 'em
We hit 'em up, he plankin' (Grr)
Steppin' out like I'm makin' a statement (Woo)
I like my bottles in cases (Yuh)
You know you killin' when that leg get to shakin', look (Shakin')

[Chorus]
Shake it, baby (Shake it, shake it), I'm into treeshin' (Lord)
She gotta eat it (What? What?), then I might eat it (Mwah)
Out the gang, I'm the meanest (Hah)
If I call a demon (Empty the clip), ain't no question needed
Pull up, start clappin' that shit for no reason (Grr, bah, bah, bah)

[Verse 2]
Niggas hoes, niggas suckas (Them niggas hoes and they bustas)
You lil' dirty motherfuckers (You little dirty motherfuckers)
She got a man, but we still fuckin' (She got a man, but we still fuckin')
Beat it in private, don't say shit when we in public (At all)
All red Bugatti but the seats the color mustard (Skrrt)
I move off actions when they speak, I never trust it (I never trust it)
Don't talk on phones, we meet in person to discuss it (Link up)
Take baby steps with the nina, I never brush it (Uh)
'Cause when I get it, then I'ma brush it (Woo)
Yeah, we the reason they stoppin' they functions (Ha)
Nine shots, big NBA, you know the rest
Put the licks on and brush it (Nine shots)
I been on go since I was a youngin' (Yeah)
We was a milli', we wylin', we buggin' (Gang, gang)
Free Choppa, free Trap, them niggas my brothers (Free 'em)
Ain't buy this pole, got this from my cousin (Grr)
Why is you talkin'? Homie, you ramblin' (Fuck up)
Shoot at a artist and get him some management (Bah, bah, bah)
Peyton Manning, I got a rocket
Watch me use it (Woo), no I ain't scramblin' (Grr)
I'm in the pussy, she might need some bandages
I caught the trips on the plug for some cannabis
She want it done, Zelle the bread
Baby a few of my niggas gon handle it (We gotchu)
[Pre-Chorus]
They said they tired of that waitin' (What?)
(Rah Swish, I'm gettin' impatient)
You never know what I'm thinkin' (Ha)
When you a boss, they do what you make 'em
We hit 'em up, he plankin' (Grr)
Steppin' out like I'm makin' a statement (Woo)
I like my bottles in cases (Yuh)
You know you killin' when that leg get to shakin', look (Shakin')

[Chorus]
Shake it, baby (Shake it, shake it), I'm into treeshin' (Lord)
She gotta eat it (What? What?), then I might eat it (Mwah)

If I call a demon (Empty the clip), ain't no question needed
Pull up, start clappin' that shit for no reason (Grr, bah, bah, bah)
