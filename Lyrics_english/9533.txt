Spanish Guitar Lyrics[Verse 1]
A smoky room, a small café
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd and close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there

[Chorus]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn (Ooh)
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long (Long)
All night long (All night long)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song
[Verse 2]
Steal my heart with every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday, yeah
I long to be the one that
You caress with a tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

[Chorus]
I wish that I was in your arms (Ooh, in your arms)
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn (Till the dawn)
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long (All night long)
All night long (All night long)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

[Break (in Spanish, performed by Felipe Elgueta)]
Te sientas entre la gente
Cierras tu ojos
Y sueñas que soy tuyo
Pero yo no sé ni siquiera que estas ahí
Me gustaría tenerte entre mis brazos amor

I sit out in the crowd and close my eyes
Dream you're mine
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

[Chorus]
I wish that I was in your arms (Oh, boy, hold me)
Like that Spanish guitar (Spanish guitar)
And you would play me through the night
Till the dawn (Till the dawn)
I wish you'd hold me in your arms (Hold me like that)
Like that Spanish guitar (Wish that I was in your arms, hey-yeah)
Like that Spanish guitar (In your arms, Spanish guitar)
All night long (All night long, yeah)
All night long (All night long, babe)
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

(Sería tu canción)

[Interlude]
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeah (Yeah)
I'll be your song, your song, your song
Play me all night long, yeah-yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song (I wish I was in your arms)
I'll be your song, yeah (And you could play me like a Spanish guitar)
I'll be your song, your song, your song (I wanna be)
I wanna be your song
I'll be your song, your song, your song (Baby)
I'll be your song, yeah
I'll be your song, your song, your song (I wish that I was in your arms)
Hold me, baby, all night long
I'll be your song, your song, your song
I'll be your song, yeahEmbed
