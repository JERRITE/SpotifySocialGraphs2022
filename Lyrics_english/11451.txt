Somebody Made for Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somewhere someone special just for me
Somewhere someone special must be
Somewhere someone special just for me (somewhere someone)
Somewhere someone special must be

[Chorus]
Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
(Ask and you'll receive)
Mmm, good God in Heaven, won't you help me please?
[Verse 2]
Somewhere someone special just for you (somewhere someone)
Somewhere someone special, it's true
Somewhere someone special just for you (somewhere someone)
Somewhere someone special, it's true

[Chorus]
Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
(Ask and you'll receive)
Mmm, good God in Heaven, won't you help me please?

[Bridge]
I've been searching all my life
Guess I've looked most everywhere
Many girls have caught my eye
But that special one's not there

[Verse 3]
Somewhere someone special just for me (somewhere someone)
Somewhere someone special, must be
Somewhere someone special just for you (somewhere someone)
Somewhere someone special, it's true

[Chorus]
Somebody made for you, somebody made for me
Somebody made for me, somebody made for you
(Ask and you'll receive)
Mmm, good God in Heaven, won't you help me please?You might also likeEmbed
