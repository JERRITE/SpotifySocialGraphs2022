Starstrukk (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go
That’s the way they all come through like
Low cut, see-through shirts that make ya
That’s the way she come through like

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Katy Perry]
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Katy Perry]
I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce
How
Do I say I’m sorry?
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Tight jeans, double Ds makin’ me go
All the people on the street know
Iced out, lit up, make the kids go
All the people on the street know

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Katy Perry]
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Katy Perry]
I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce
How
Do I say I’m sorry?
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce

You know that type of shit just don't work on me
Whistlin’ and tryin' to flirt with me
Don’t take this personally
'Cause we were never in love
It doesn’t really matter who you say you are
Singin' out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar
‘Cause L-O-V-E’s not what this was

[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Katy Perry]
I think I should know (Whoa-oh)
How (Whoa-oh)
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out (Whoa-oh)
Now (Whoa-oh)
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce
(Whoa-oh)
How (Whoa-oh)
Do I say I’m sorry?
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out (Whoa-oh)
Now (Whoa-oh)
L-O-V-E’s just another word I never learned to pronounce12Embed
