Let Me See Your Phone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Since we been together
Lord knows I've wanted you
Oh, to love me the same way
Yeah, to love me the same way
As I do
It's true, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when I look in your eyes
They don't shine just as bright as they used to (As they used to)
Said when I look in your eyes and you look back in mine
They look see-through
Can't believe you
[Chorus]
So let me see your phone
Type in your passcode
So I can see inside of your soul
And I'm scrollin' down to find where it might be

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, arguments
Said you're done with me 'cause I'm startin' shit
But I'm leavin' you 'cause you on some shit
"Who is such and such? What is all of this?"
We made a bond and you dishonored it
What's worse is you won't acknowledge it
And in spite of all my accomplishments
You took my pride and just stomped on it (Damn)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when you look in my eyes (You look in my eyes)
They don't shine just as bright as they used to (They don't shine just as bright)
As they used to (They don't shine just as bright)
Said when you look in my eyes (You look in my eyes)
And I don't look surprised (I don't, oh)
It's 'cause I'm used to (I'm used to you)
What you do, babe, damn

[Chorus]
Let me see your phone (Let me see your phone, baby)
Type in your passcode
So I can see inside of your soul (Inside)
And I'm scrollin' down to find where it might be
You might also like[Outro]
'Cause it ain't here with me
So where could it be?
'Cause it ain't here with me
So where could it be?Embed
