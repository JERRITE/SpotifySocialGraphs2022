Vamo to Busal Lyricsletra "vamo 'to Busal" [intro]
Jowell!
Vamo 'to give him slow
Hey
Randy!

[Chorus: Randy]
Vamo 'to Busal, grab your hair
Vamo ', Don Don, to' the world to the ground
Do not worry, what happens here, here it stays
Throw whatever, call the bartender, I pay you whatever
Vamo 'pa' the room, low pa 'house
For you believe and see, that you wiggle or call you the kennel
I don't want to tell you or compare you with a ramppleter
Simply, if you don't get carried away, you are going outside
Fall in love and ...

[Verse 1: jowell]
And vamo 'to give him slow
Mai 'You don't see that you look up with your flow
Simple, put feka when you make up makeup
Ronca de Santa, is Putilla path

Abuser, sinner, dance well
He never falls in love or delivers to 100
It is not wrong when it gives it down
When on the track it is the rak

[Verse 2: randy]
Silence, much much incense smoke
Intense beautiful that leaves me menso
Silence, much much incense smoke
Intense beautiful that leaves me menso

VE-VE-VE-Ven, that this is an abuse
I have not given that evil and I accuse me
Oh yeah? 'Tá well, you are Antiel's
So he wants me to, he wants him to give him, he wants limon and honey
You might also like a bug
Salt me ​​from the environment that your flow is cheap
Cacos Flow battery, there are no toads here
Yours are Fundita, mine are bags

What a damn flow, what a curse swag
These bastards are checking for copying
Black fabric here to La'o, to the mirror cela
Respect for the old woman, riddling new school

[Bridge: Jowell, Randy]
The one who is taken away, I want to dance
Whoever is ennota'o, I want me to brinque and jump
Uh, I know that it goes to it and does not take off
Uh, then she makes the holy

They say that when dream is an abuse
The Shorty tried it, he liked it, and I accuse me
I accuse me of abuse (na na na na)
Na na na na

[Chorus: Randy]
Vamo 'to Busal, grab your hair
Vamo ', Don Don, to' the world to the ground
Do not worry, what happens here, here it stays
Throw whatever, call the bartender, I pay you whatever
Vamo 'pa' the room, low pa 'house
For you believe and see, that you wiggle or call you the kennel
I don't want to tell you or compare you with a ramppleter
Simply, if you don't get carried away, you are going outside
Fall in love and ...

[Verse 3: jowell]
Give me a hot night
Mai 'you are read pa' get to the tooth
And bad mine, you're burning, in Hot
Enterit, from behind to the front

South, and let the temperature rise
You have the cure that takes away the bitterness
Don't be afraid, just move it back
I know that you are going for choli baby, you will not stay

[Verse 4: Randy]
A bug more bastard than the bosses
Salt me ​​from the environment that your flow is cheap
Cacos Flow battery, there are no toads here
Yours are Fundita, mine are bags

VE-VE-VE-Ven, that this is an abuse
I have not given that evil and I accuse me
Oh yeah? 'Tá well, you are Antiel's
So he wants me to, he wants him to give him, he wants limon and honey

Want Limon and Honey, wants lemon and honey
Limon wants, Limon wants, wants lemon and honey
Want Limon and Honey, wants lemon and honey
He wants him to give him, he wants him to give him, he wants limon and honey (Blass!)

Wants lemon and honey, which goes down
That the knees tremble, and you lower down
Don't be pachosa, give it, take out the courage
Put wild, give it, and make me go down

[Bridge: Jowell, Randy]
The one who is snatched ', I want him to dance
The one who is ennotao ', I want me to brinque and jump
Uh, I know that it goes to it and does not take off
Uh, then she makes the holy

They say that when dream is an abuse
The Shorty tried it, he liked it, and I accuse me
I accuse me of abuse (na na na na)
Na na na na

They say that when dream is an abuse
The Shorty tried it, he liked it, and I accuse me
I accuse me of abuse (na na na na)
Na na na na

[Outro]
Let's go pa'l choli mami, don't think about it and buy the ticket
On January 30 I go there
Choli Mami, don't think about it and buy the ticket

Jowell and Randy!
