The Great Pretender Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender (Woo-woo)
Pretending I'm doing well (Woo-woo)
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender (woo-woo)
Adrift in a world of my own (woo-woo)
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
[Bridge]
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

[Verse 3]
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender (Woo-woo)
Just laughing and gay like a clown (Woo-woo)
I seem to be what I'm not (You see)
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

[Bridge]
Yeah! Ooh-ooh!
Too real when I feel
What my heart can't conceal, oh

[Verse 4]
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown (Woo-woo)
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown

[Outro]
Pretending that you're
Pretending that you're still aroundYou might also like6Embed
