RUNNING HOME LyricsCh-ch-ch-Chase

Dis that 2020 shit, dat Henny Henny shit, you get me?
Man better stop playing with me this year
B-I-T-S
Shout out LOVE SEPT

Yo, dis year imma come take my shit
My team winning, it's bait, it's clear
2019 was the warm up round
Now I'm out of town with a fag and a beer
Shut down Camden a hundred times
Shut down London a hundred times
Just shut Belgium down with my gang, my bros, my fam, my slimes
Like anyway, finding myself, I'm becoming a monster
Man get boiled alive like lobster
I want deals this year, no Nokia
Big money moves so the fam eat proper
They wanna hold me, tell 'em I got ya
Hеnny2Cozy back on the roaster
Wait, but I nevеr left
Man better respect or you will regret the day you stepped to the god, uh
[?] targets red like Harry
Don't mean Megan but I want success, no Sussex
I don't mean no Duchess
Got a lean in my step, need crutches
Would've thought that the beat the case, the way that I buss it
Fuck it, letting it off like it was a musket, no trumpet
Get the beats then [?]

Yeah, and I run this show
See the man, they're running home
Take smoke in my lungs then blow
Like, I don't give a fuck, I'm grown
No, I don't really wanna go home
When I chase stacks and I shut down shows, oh
Now them man wanna show, no
Man, I erase them foes

Yeah, and I run this show
See the man, they're running home
Take smoke in my lungs then blow
Like, I don't give a fuck, I'm grown
No, I don't really wanna go home
When I chase stacks and I shut down shows, oh
Now them man wanna show, no
Man, I erase them foesYou might also likeEmbed
