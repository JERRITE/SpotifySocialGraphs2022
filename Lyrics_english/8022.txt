Close your Eyes Lyrics [Words of "Close Your Eyes" ft. Jr o crom]

[Intro: Gims]
Close your Eyes

[Verse 1 - Maître Gims]
Oddly everyone knows how to dance as soon as the tickets play the violin
And everyone finds the jokes of the funny billionaire
Africa is a dragon looking for a lighter
I make noise, but I stand invisible like the locust
I send heavy, but not even believe that I am touched on touches-car
The world frees like Igor and Grichka
Wati-B formed me, nothing could surprise me
I'm the penguin that will cheer your fingers in the nose
Akhi, it's God who will stop you
I saw things that would run a tetra '
Don't take us for morons
This is where the river is deeper that it makes the least noise
The world: a business tree
The fruits change in cash, do not wish me "Happy Christmas"
"Vortex" on the coat of arms, yes you're in the right wagon
But be careful to zouker the mother of the dragons
[Refrain - Maître Gims]
Nothing is ever acquired (never acquired)
You go straight in a wall without even seeing it (even seeing it)
The world is black my daughter: Close your Eyes (Close Your Eyes)
The world is black my daughter: Close your Eyes (Close Your Eyes)
Close your Eyes, end of the game card

[Verse 2 - jr o crom]
No need to live in L.A. to die black and proud
With us pride has dropped the most hardcore and proud
Follow me
I'm going to show you people we don't see even in the cinema
I'm marked like Albator, except that I don't balaf
On the torso W.A.T.I.-B. : Salam
I saw men in a cavalcade, Jazi bleeding the arcade
Confined blocks on keufs ​​cars, people are vate-sa
Spartans without their asphalt caner shield
Lascars give body and souls, covet the card-pla
Listening laptops since the time of tam-tam
Diszined thugs fuck the breed in Batman
In our ghettos, it is teeming with paces-ra
I am the rose of the bouquet, the darkest whose petals fane
Without Kevlar, I came to clean the sword in Duncan
Aboriginal, claustrophobic because of slave boats

[Refrain - Maître Gims]
Nothing is ever acquired (never acquired)
You go straight in a wall without even seeing it (even seeing it)
The world is black my daughter: Close your Eyes (Close Your Eyes)
The world is black my daughter: Close your Eyes (Close Your Eyes)
