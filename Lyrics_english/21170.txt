Jaded (These Years) (feat. Benji Madden) LyricsThere's a time and place for everything
There's a reason why certain people meet
There's a destination for everyone
Whats the explaintion when we're done...

All the summer nights, spent wondering
So many questions asked, but no ones answering
Would it be ok if I left today?
Took my chances on what you said was wrong

I'm jaded, stupid and reckless
Not sorry, when I'll never regret
These years spent so faded and reckless
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years
Ill never regret these years...
Now here I sit, so far away
Remebering all the memeories
Its times like these that I miss you most
Remebering when we were so close

I'm jaded, stupid and reckless
Not sorry, and I'll never regret
These years spent so faded and reckless
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years

I'll never forget the places we've been, you and I
Our lives, are slipping away, dont want to let time pass us by...by!

Im jaded, stupid and reckless
Not sorry, and I'll never regret
These years spent so faded and reckless
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years

I'm jaded stupid and reckless
Not sorry and ill never regret....
