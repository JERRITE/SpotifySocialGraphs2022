Bad Neighbors Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fuck my neighbors
I'm tryna put my mama on two acres
Then make it splash on you haters
I'ma get money, I'ma be big
Believe me, God, I tried
It ain't easy to be me, no, no
I was way, way far behind
Now they gon' see
Yeah, they gon' see me, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, them doors, now they suicide
But I hold it down, down until I die
Yeah, them doors, now they suicide
But I hold it down, down until I die

[Post-Chorus]
(And those doors, now they suicide)
(And those doors, now they suicide)

[Verse 2]
I've been on a ride, yessir
Got a bad little thing, but thе money come first, yeah
I don't know whеn they gon' learn
Gotta give it to 'em straight, but it ain't no point
Back in LA and ish
Slide in a thing, same day I'll hit
Girl, let me see you do that thing
Girl, I know that
If you wanna make the roof gone (If you wanna make the roof gone)
It's like poof, then my coupe's gone (It's like poof, then my coupe's gone)
Girl, let's take it back to your house (Let's take it back to your house)
I get it poppin', then you know I'm out

[Chorus]
Them doors, now they suicide
But I hold it down, down until I die
Yeah, them doors, now they suicide
But I hold it down, down until I die

Believe me, God, I tried
It ain't easy to be me, no, no
I was way, way far behind
Now they gon' see
Yeah, they gon' see me, yeahEmbed
