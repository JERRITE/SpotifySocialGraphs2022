After all (I Thought We were over) lyrics [verse 1]
I didn't know where you were, I couldn't find you
And remembered the sound of your voice, as if it were yesterday
And I don't know what we did wrong, I don't want to blame you
And I know we tried more than once, and it ended badly

And now you are here
I hope it is forever
Don't go again
I never thought you would return to me
Again
[Chorus]
And you are here, after all
I will not let you go again
You are in my arms, and there is no better place
And you are here, without fear of loving me
As if yes yesterday, I can't believe
We are here, after all

[Verse 2]
I saw your photo and I missed you anymore, I couldn't think
My heart couldn't follow anymore, I can hug you today

And now you are here
I hope it is forever
Don't go again
I never thought you would return to me
Again, and again, and again

[Chorus]
And you are here, after all
I will not let you go again
You are in my arms, and there is no better place
And you are here, without fear of loving me
As if yes yesterday, I can't believe
We are here, after all
You might also likehoy when I see your eyes I know that we are fine
I'm not afraid to try again, love
If you say "I love you" again, and again, and again

You are here after all
I will not let you go
Again, you are in my arms
And there is no better place

[Chorus]
And you are here, after all
I will not let you go again
You are in my arms, and there is no better place
And you are here, without fear of loving me
As if yes yesterday, I can't believe
We are here, after all
