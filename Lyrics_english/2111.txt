Soul Sucker Lyrics[Verse 1]
Beautiful vixen, but nobody else knows
She’s got an addiction to the powder in her nose
A touch from her lips will leave you turned to stone
You’re better off alone
She’s too high to listen, oh, always stuck in the clouds
Painting a picture, but it’s upside down
I bet that you wish that you never kissed
But it’s too late now

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t get too lost in her arms
All she wants is a bite of your heart
[Chorus]
I don’t wanna run, nowhere to hide
There’s a devil in my room and I don’t mind
Soul sucker, don’t touch her
‘Cause you might just losе your life
Careful for the poison up hеr sleeve
Touch you in the morning, haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they’re never leaving alive

[Verse 2]
Swear that you love her little claws in your brain
Cannibal lover, feeding off your pain
You’re just another stain on the sheets
Where she keeps them chained

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t get wrapped up, wicked spells
All she wants is to drag you through hell

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna run, nowhere to hide
There’s a devil in my room and I don’t mind
Soul sucker, don’t touch her
‘Cause you might just lose your life
Careful for the poison up her sleeve
Touch you in the morning, haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they’re never leaving alive
You might also like[Bridge]
Soul sucker, bet you didn’t want to leave your lover
Never over ‘cause she pulled you under
Now you’re laying in the grave you dug her, no wonder
Soul sucker, bet you didn’t want to leave your lover
Never over ‘cause she pulled you under
Now you’re laying in the grave you dug her, no wonder

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna run, nowhere to hide
There’s a devil in my room and I don’t mind
Soul sucker, don’t touch her
‘Cause you might just lose your life
Careful for the poison up her sleeve
Touch you in the morning, haunt you in your dreams
Soul sucker, they love her
But they’re never leaving alive1Embed
