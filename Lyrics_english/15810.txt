Kisses at war lyrics [letter of "kisses at war" ft. Juanes]

[Verse 1: Morat]
Who told you that lie?
That you were easy to forget
Do not pay attention to your friends
They are only witnesses of the other half

[Verse 2: juanes]
Two kisses are too much
And a kiss will not be enough
And even if they warn the soldier, if he is in love
At war he will die
[Pre-car: Morat]
You don't have to take care of me anymore

[Chorus: Morat & Juanes]
Because I
I have always known that your kisses kill
That your promises rhyme with pain
That you are an expert to steal beats to my heart
And you, you never swore that it would be unharmed
You no longer dare to apologize
I confess that I do not regret
And although I am suffering, it could be worse
Oh oh oh
Knowing that your kisses kill, I will die of love
Oh oh oh
Knowing that your kisses kill, I will die of love
Oh oh oh
Knowing that your kisses kill

[Verse 3: Morat]
For me it was never a game
For you it was one more kiss
And if you go back to my life today
Not that you are lost, it's no accident

[Pre-car: Morat]
You don't have to take care of me anymore

I will win the war to conquer you
I don't want to admit that you're leaving, that you're leaving
I will win the war to conquer you
I don't want to admit that you're leaving, that you're leaving
I lost battles for never accepting that
You weren't easy to forget
