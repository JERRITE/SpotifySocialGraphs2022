Nataaoki Lyrics [lyrics by "Nataaoki" ft. Steve Aoki]

[Enter: Natanael Cano]
Uh, Yah
Steve Aoki
DIM MAK IN FIRE
Ah, tonight is about
Tonight is about getting drarugged, Drugged
I Said "Yes, Don't Leave Without Your Gun"
UH, Yeah, UH, Yeah
Ah, tonight is about
[Chorus: Natanael Cano]
Loot the studs, washing, girls
The party falls, that is not dawn
The girls do not pray, they go to discos
They get in ecsta, the hot mind
And so it starts, and until dawn
It goes cold, your goal is eating the dam
Private the table, only van beauties
One hundred drinks, starts, likes it mixes and this already exploded (fi-fire!)
It's lit!
(Ah, ah)

[Drop]

[Saying: Natanael Cano]
I like how looks at me
I also like her friend
Baby, I never turned off
If I turn off, I bring battery
I don't understand what I feel
I'm not good, I'm sorry
Sometimes I speak, or think
But I feel happy (tonight is about
I like how looks at me
I also like her friend
Baby, I never turned off
(Tonight Is About Getting Drugged, Drugged)
If I turn off, I bring battery
I don't understand what I feel
I'm not good, I'm sorry
Sometimes I speak, or think
But I feel happy (Tonight)

They get in ecsta, the hot mind
And so it starts, and until dawn
It goes cold, your goal is eating the dam
Private the table, only van beauties
One hundred drinks, starts, likes it mixes and this already exploded, -tó, -tó (fi -fire!)
It's lit! (And this already exploded) embed
