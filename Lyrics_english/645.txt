Love me while you can be lyrics [letter of "love me while you can"]

[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
OH-WOH-OH
Manuel Turizo

[Chorus]
Love me while you can (Yeah)
That life is a wheel that gives you a thousand return ', in the end nothing remains
I have not seen the first story
That someone dies and something takes
And the best thing about this story is that you are my partner
From this passing life (Wouh, Wouh)
[Verse 1]
Love me while I love you
And it doesn't mean you're mine
That's why I keep good memories in the piggy bank
To remind you in case you leave one day (Yeah)
That this has been a poetry
What writing 'the two
Unique, in each chapter
He loves me before me
From before 'I watched Gucci or Valentino
They are things of destiny
Thanks to Dio 'who put us together on the way

[Chorus]
Love me while you can (you can)
That life is a wheel that turns you around ', in the end nothing remains (nothing remains)
I have not seen the first story that someone dies and something takes (it takes, takes)
And the best thing about this story is that you are my partner (my partner)
From this passing life (passenger life)

[Verse 2]
And even if I love you for eternity
Everything in life has its beginning and its end
You and I do not see the exception, it does not feel you 'bad
And if I'm going to be happy before crying
That's why I love me in life, Vivamo 'lo' day '
Making a story of the 'that are not forgotten
I have seen the love disguised as hypocrisy
The pocket full with head 'empty'
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
There are such toxic loves
That nobody understands them, they are not logical
But when love is between two
Butterflies are not cramps

[Chorus]
Love me while you can (love me)
That life is a wheel that turns you around ', in the end nothing remains (nothing remains)
I have not seen the first story that someone dies and something takes (it takes, takes)
And the best thing about this story is that you are my partner (my partner)
From this passing life (of this passing life)
