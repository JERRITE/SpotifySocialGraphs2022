Everybodyâ€™s Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dragged into another heartbreak
Like a moth into a flame
Are we programmed for broken romance?
Everything just sounds the same

[Chorus]
Why's every song about love or drinking too much?
Yeah, maybe that's because everybody's lonely
On your radio, there's another song that goes
"Babe, I'll never let you go"
Everybody's lonely, everybody's lonely
[Verse 2]
Digging through another playlist
Searching for a piece of art
A Jackson Pollock, some piece of gossip
Why can't we tell them all apart?

[Chorus]
Why's every song about love or drinking too much?
Yeah, maybe that's because everybody's lonely
On your radio, there's another song that goes
"Babe, I'll never let you go"
Everybody's lonely, everybody's lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody's lonely
Everybody's lonely

[Bridge]
Everybody, everybody's lonely

[Chorus]
Why's every song about love or drinking too much?
Yeah, maybe that's because everybody's lonely (Yeah)
On your radio, there's another song that goes
"Babe, I'll never let you go"
Everybody's lonely, everybody's lonely

Oh, everybody's lonely
Everybody's lonely
Woo, everybody lonely, yeah
Everybody's lonely, everybody's lonely6Embed
