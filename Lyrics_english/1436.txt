​​it’s not u it’s me Lyrics[Verse 1: Bea Miller]
I did anything you wanted, that's me
Gave you everything you wanted
But I started feeling haunted, by me
'Cause it wasn't what I wanted

[Pre-Chorus 1: Bea Miller]
And you were trying so hard with your pictures to look richer
That's not what I want to do
Your distractions were exactly what I needed
Now I see the truth
[Chorus: Bea Miller]
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
I'm the only one I need (Ooh-ooh)
It's not you, baby (Baby)
'Cause I'm leaving you for me (Ooh-ooh)
I don't want you blaming yourself
It's bad for your health
'Cause honestly (Ooh)
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
I'm the only one I need (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Bea Miller]
I'm sure someone's gonna love you, not me
And love all the things that you do
Took a minute but it hit me finally
That I'm not the person for you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bea Miller]
And I wanna lay under the stars
And hear the ocean while I'm talking bullshit
High with the people that are real
Don't make me feel like an idiot

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
I'm the only one I need (Ooh-ooh)
It's not you, baby (Baby)
'Cause I'm leaving you for me (Ooh-ooh)
I don't want you blaming yourself
It's bad for your health
'Cause honestly (Ooh)
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
I'm the only one I need (Haha, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Who you gon' call when it all fall down?
I just get a little lost, now I'm all found
Missed call now (Brrrr), block 'em all now (Woo)
I was told on, but I'm all on now
Big cap, why lie?
You are not the one I wanted, yeah
(You are not the one I wanted)
And I started feeling haunted by me (Ooh)
'Cause I know now what I wanted is
Peace of mind
It's not you, I figured I'm done wasting time
It'll be fine, self-love ain't selfish
My love reigns supreme, you felt it, yeah

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
I'm the only one I need (Ooh-ooh)
It's not you, baby (Baby)
'Cause I'm leaving you for me (Ooh-ooh)
(I'm the only one, I'm the, I'm the only one)
I don't want you blaming yourself
It's bad for your health
(I'm the only one, it's me)
'Cause honestly (Ooh)
(I'm the only one, I'm the, I'm the only one)
It's not you, it's me (It's me)
(I'm the only one, it's me)
I'm the only one I need14Embed
