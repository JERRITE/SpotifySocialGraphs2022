[Intro]
Eh, huh, eh, eh
Hey Rvssian
Eh, huh, eh, eh

[Pre-Caro: Rauw Alejandro]
That night you came back
Crying you convinced me
That you didn't want to hurt me
I made love in the bathroom
Your gaze is not reliable
Like Tokyo, it's unstable
Regardless of the damage you have caused
I love you pa'trá 'and that is bad
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
Bad, bad, but bad (huh, eh, eh)
I love you pa'trá 'and that e' bad (eh, eh, eh, eh, еh)
Bad, bad, but bad (huh, eh, eh)
Be cеrca of you, for me that e 'bad (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh), for me that is bad

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I’m tryin ’to keep you up
Quaranting with me for no reason, Love Drunk, Got Me Floored
LEFT YOUR CHANEL BAG IN MY PORSCHE (NO-OH)
I Shoulda Dropped You Off
Memories We Repeat Every Weekend, Li-Like This Before
You do me when you get bored
It ain't no problem, it’s cool, what you doin 'tonight?
Long As You Keep Comin 'and I'M Fuckin ’You Right
Don's Mind Me, Love ('More)
Another Chance for Me To Give You What's Yours
And i know that it's bad
WHEN I LET YOU PULL ME RIGHT BACK
'Cause You Never Promise Tomorrow
You Give Me Your Love, But It's Borrowed
Lay You Down and Forget All The Past
Only One That Could Do Me Like That
How you comin 'and goin' is tidal
You rub on my body, but i know, ooh

[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Baby, it's over
I cut you from Raí ', now where to put on I decide
That my flower dies
Difficult I put it (Yah)
I just saw in my car that his wallet stayed
By the way he left it (ey)
Always put an excuse for seeing me again
I later 'what a fight', he wants to do it to me
With just a kiss I forgot
Everything she did to me, ey

[Pre-Caro: Rauw Alejandro]
That night you came back
Crying you convinced me
That you didn't want to hurt me

Your gaze is not reliable
Like Tokyo, it's unstable
Regardless of the damage you have caused
I love you pa'trá 'and that is bad
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Chris Brown]
Bad, bad, but bad (huh, eh, eh)
