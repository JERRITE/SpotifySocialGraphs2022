Things that nobody sees lyrics [lyrics of "things that nobody sees"] 

 [Pre-stribe] 
 Did you know 
 I know you more than you can see 
 And I don't know very well 
 Where will you meet when you are no longer 

 [Chorus] 
 Love you is very hard 
 But I get so natural to me 
 You know I could be able 
 Of fucking everything, uh oh-oh 
 Those things that nobody sees 
 What we do not understand 
 They are violent times 
 Pa 'love ourselves in secret, Yeah 

 [Verse] 
 The sounds, bae 
 When we talk strong and silent 
 We always have to lose 
 And take Pal 'memory (mmm) 

 [Chorus] 
 Love you is very hard 
 But I don't want to shut him up 
 You know I could be able 
 Of fucking everything, uh oh-oh 

 Those things that nobody sees 
 What we do not understand 
 They are violent times 
 Pa 'love ourselves in secret, Yeah 

 Those things that nobody sees 
 What we do not understand 
 They are violent times 
 Pa 'love ourselves in secret, Yeah
