I could have sworn you were dead LyricsI could have sworn you were dead
But i saw you in a dream last night
There were flowers growing out of your head
And it made me smile
Because they were yellow and red
Like the kind that i left on your grave
I forget the name the florist said
But they were beautiful

Your face is so easily read
I'm happy you're happy you're dead
I know you were always so tired
So sleepYou might also likeEmbed
