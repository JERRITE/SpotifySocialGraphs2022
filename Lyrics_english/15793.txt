He was perfect [live] Lyricsesos black eyes
And your way of dreaming of reality
Light heart, caught me without asking
Unintentionally notify

Yes, you didn't say a thousand sweet words not
No I, if I never saw that the blind was me

He was perfect his only defect
Is that he never fell in love with me
I tried to force it and asked for a miracle
And it turns out that love is not like that
Nara, Nara, Naranana
Nara, Nara, Naranana ...
Heat to cold if it is affection is not loving
You don't want to hurt me
I got into a mess
Because in the face of the truth, I don't have to blame

Yes, you didn't say a thousand sweet words not
No I, if I never saw that the blind was me

He was perfect his only defect
Is that he never fell in love with me
I tried to force it and asked for a miracle
And it turns out that love is not like that
Nara, Nara, Naranana
Nara, Nara, Naranana ...

He was perfect his only defect
Is that he never fell in love with me
I tried to force it and asked for a miracle
And it turns out that love is not like that

No I, if I never saw that the blind was me
He was perfect his only defect
Is that he never fell in love with Miyou Might Also Likeembed
