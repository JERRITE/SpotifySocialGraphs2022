Gaia Lyrics [text by "Gaia"]

[Intro]
Duffy, Okay, Okay

[Refrain 1]
And I recover Gaia, Gaia
The redeemed all style Narnia, Narnia
I write a song that looks like a fairy tale, a little mild me
The reactivation at dawn, pentagram mind
While a drama returns, cry
[Verse 1]
On stage pendant, Jack Sparrow
That day at the bottom I joked
I didn't want to make an empire
But I didn't wake up
Be well, I don't know why, but it is fine (hey)
Among a thousand songs, two or three prayers
Do it for you, do it for her
You just do it, then who sees you
If you find me too many things that I don't give, and I who then sow
Fuck 'sti trees bare (fuck)
And so Goodbye, I who did not find the good vibes
Because if I have a past it is only what you know
Uh, come on, under the calendars to get to the level
But but I don't understand

[Refrain 2]
And I recover Gaia, Gaia
The redeemed all style Narnia, Narnia
I write a song that looks like a fairy tale, a little mild me
The reactivation at dawn, pentagram mind
While a drama

[Post-riernello]
You who have been what I will never be
I lose myself in the void, in the traits of his face
I'm writing the day from the first sunset, offline
While I resume Gaia, a dream on paper of paper (UOH)
Stories talk to me, na, na
You Might Also Like [Virfa 2]
And Fa-Fa-Fauno, Fara-Fa-Fallo (UOH)
Who know it (UOH), that is at stake
And Ba-Bastardo (Ah), like the past
Stories of a child, walk but do not fall (no)
I save you, hey (hey)
If I regard you know (you know) that I detach myself
I cry if Rivado in Mairon (in Mairon)
Because every time I make a trip

[Refrain 2]
And I recover Gaia, Gaia
The redeemed all style Narnia, Narnia
I write a song that looks like a fairy tale, a little mild me
The reactivation at dawn, pentagram mind
While a drama

[Post-riernello]
You who have been what I will never be
I lose myself in the void, in the traits of his face
I'm writing the day from the first sunset, offline
While I resume Gaia, a dream on paper of paper (UOH)
Stories talk to me
Na, na, stop

[Outro]
While I cry: "Bastard, bastard, bastard"
While I cry: "bastard", oh, no-no, no, no-no
