Friends and enemies (remix) Lyrics [lyrics of "friends and enemies (remix)" ft. Almighty & Bad Bunny]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
(Yeh; Yeh, Yeh)

[Saying: Bad Bunny & Noriel]
I know that you want to sleep today in my bed
When I leave you alone, you call me '(SHH)
With him, it happens to you 'fighting (Yeh)
And he has no idea that you are snoring with me shouting (Yeh, Yeh)
[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Noriel]
Baby, turn off the cell phone, I'm going to look for you at 12
If your man does not 'take, tell him that he is wrong, that you don't know me' (that you don't know me ')
Pa'l Mundo Somo 'Friends, but in the enemy bed'
When he leaves you alone, you go crazy about being with me
Baby, turn off the cell phone, I'm going to look for you at 12
If your man does not take, tell him that he 'tá bad, that you don't know me (that you don't know me')
Pa'l Mundo Somo 'Friends (AH), but in bed enemies (Wuh)
When he leaves you alone, you make you 'crazy for being with me (no-no-noriel)

[Verse 1: Noriel]
That cat is an idiot, in bed he no longer gives you note (hehehe)
This bug is told "Mayweather" because he is undefeated and without a defeat (Devil ', baby)
Tell him, that with me you float ', that he is calm, to look for another
He is like the apple
Baby, you are like bread, because you have given me that ass of 'vece' (aha)
Your boyfriend looks like a Sam Sam and does not put it as you deserve '(no)
Pichea the 'stupid' (wuh), knee 'and it is not pa' that I pray '(hehehe)
And tell your boyfriend to avoid, if he doesn't want the AK to straighten him, Wuh! (PRR)
I am going to give you to what life you remember from me
You dream with me awake from the first day I gave you
The time does not matter, when I am with me ignore it
The most I like about you is that you don't fall in love with

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
(Bad Bunny, Baby)
I invited him to make the cinema (HUH)
I suckled it until I came (brra)
Fill 'of milk and sweat the bearing' (Yeh)
PERFUM YOU, GO VICINI (UH-WUH), YEH
Turn on another phillie, baby, before it ends (that it ends)
Vamo 'to do it another sees', that for that was that I came
Your boyfriend has a face that works at Forever 21 (HUH)
Yours and his is comedy, as he can
Tell him that today I walk with the Lightsaber, like Obi-Wan (ah, ah)
Tony Montana fucking Elvira
And 'expert creating lies
With me it does it weekly
With you the condom expires, Yeh (bar)

[Verse 3: Almighty]
Percocet before looking for you
Thus I lasted to 'the night before I will give you
I called and he replied, I asked about another
Tell him you're leaving with your friend, Baby, tell him that the night is from us ', ma' (Wuh, Wuh, Wuh, Yeh)
While he works, I work for her (ah)
At noon the kidnapping (I take it)
It does not wrap because nothing shows him (aha)
I always repeat, nobody knows our
You are not my main dish, but, mommy (mommy)
I pass the tongue as the tsunami pass'
I want you to sleep in my cami
If it's about singing down, I get down and I won a grammy
Tell you that you are a swinger
That you like to make you a mustache like the one with the pringle '(dile)
The Bellaqueo 'are your jingle'
So turn off the cell phone, I'm arriving with the finger
I put it to you while he wants to sing
I told you, baby, that I was going to love
Tell him that he puts a hand, that he cannot be removed
And what is late because dust is not going to frighten me
(Almighty!)
[Saying: Noriel & Bad Bunny]
I know you want to 'sleep today in my bed
When I leave you alone, you call me
With him, you spend it fighting
And he has no idea that with me you are snoring shouting
