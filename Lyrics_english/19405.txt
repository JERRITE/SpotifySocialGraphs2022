Bad For It Lyrics[Verse 1: Cam Meekins]
You know I got it, come get it for me
You was on my mind, it's a different story
I seen you in the city where I rest at
And I'm stressed at, rolled sess at
Let money come and I get that
That's on your summer, I guessed that
Know I had to do it for you
Nobody's gon' do it for you
If you ain't working, you ain't loyal
I can't stay witchu if you ain't royal, on my king shit
Smoking loud in the green room right before I sing shit
Yeah, that's real, go to every city
Brand new jeans, white boy looking pretty
Million dollar deal, I'm just trying to do a fiddy
Need a girl with an Instagram popping with me
Yeah, and you know that
See me in the beantown, that's where I grow at
Catch me at the C's game, that's where your hoe at
Rappers got hot so I had to take the flow back
That's word, she need a triple threat
I need a bad bitch, an eleven out of ten
I'ma call you back baby, just one sec
Think what's next
[Hook: Cam Meekins]
So just work for it, beg for it
Grab for it, don't ask for it
I spend this cash for it
I'm mad for it, that's my bad for it
But I'm a young ass king that been bad for it

Just work for it, beg for it
Grab for it, don't ask for it
I spend this cash for it
I'm mad for it, that's my bad for it
But I'm a young ass king that been bad for it

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
It's funny how it all came out of the blue
Young king given nothing but tools
In a world filled with nothing but rules
In a room filled with nothing but fools
I'm over here, I'm trying to figure it out
But fuck 'em, I did that shit for effect
I still remember when a venue wouldn't give me a set
I still remember when this girl wouldn't send me a text
And now its "Witt, you're the one up next"
I knew that shit, I do this shit
Fuck you, you bitch, maneuver quick
If I'm the shit then I'm poop and piss
I still remember selling burgers like I'm stupid rich
Got loot to get, a dumb and a stupid kid
Look through my tips, my time for some minimum pay
Most of y'all are probably thinking
"Okay, go to work every day and complain on my Facebook page
About how much I hate my job and my boss is lame"
We're not the same, I'm in my zone, I'm in my lane
It's funny how it's money that'll make us change
And man, it's funny how it's money that'll make us reign
See, you could buy a lot of shit, but you can't buy brain
They'll take my brain the day that I go out
But what would you expect with a mind, oh so profound?
Every girl from my town is now all so down
It's funny how they switch up when they hear my sound
From lost to found, girl I don't care if you sing
I fuck with me, me and me, I don't care who you bring
What's a pawn to king? What's an arm to a wing?
What's a job to a boss? What's a loss to a win and if
Ah, fuck, I digress, a couple pretty girls send me snaps of they chest
Surrounded by sin, I don't want to live less
So I always keep my morals in check, muhfucker, it's Witt

So just work for it, beg for it
Grab for it, don't ask for it
I spend this cash for it
I'm mad for it, that's my bad for it
But I'm a young ass king that been bad for it

Just work for it, beg for it
Grab for it, don't ask for it
I spend this cash for it
I'm mad for it, that's my bad for it
But I'm a young ass king that been bad for it1Embed
