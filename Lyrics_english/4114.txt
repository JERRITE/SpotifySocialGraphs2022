Ey, me '

[Chorus: Jory Boy & Ñengo Flow]
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'

[Post-car: Jory Boy]
That even Random on the street treat me better
I have a pair of it, none the same
If you see me pulling down the street, don't say "Hello"
Don't send me kisses or messages

I have a random torque on the street that fuck better
All are varied, none the same
If you see me shining down the street, don't say "hello"
Don't send me kisses or messages

[Chorus: Jory Boy]
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'

If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'

How much calls me ', how much claims me'
If when I loved you, you had another sleeping in your bed (You, Bitch)
I have no more na 'to tell you, you calm you can leave
You're going to remember my talent when you want to come
And I can't ', now I keep me
He wants my candle, I melted and she freezes you
Better to your 'saints arise a candle
Because I do not plan to return (ieh-ieh-ieh)
This face will not be seen again (IEH-ieh-ieh)
Cazzu, Baby

[Bridge: Cazzu, Ñengo Flow]
LOL
I'm on the disc, out there alone walking
I have a couple of cats, that they spend it by throwing
With a flow matador, it must be for whom I am
And I don't love you anymore, it's what is killing you

[Chorus: Jory Boy, Cazzu]
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'

If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Don't look for me '
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Don't look for me '

[Verse 2: Ñengo Flow]
My feelings towards you are dead '
I can be wrong or I can be right
I don't want to see you close to me
This broke this, but I didn't lose
I made you a woman when I put you
My eye were crowded 'when I lost you

[Bridge: Ñengo Flow]
You don't love me, don't tell me anything
You do what you want, you are released
Looking for what to do, looking for pleasure
Delivering your body in different beds
When you want sex na 'more', then look for me '
He hates me, but he loves me and that never forgets
You don't love me, don't tell me anything
You do what you want, you are released
Looking for what to do, looking for pleasure
Delivering your body in different beds
When you want sex na 'more', then look for me '
He hates me, but he loves me and that never forgets

[Post-car: Jory Boy]
That even Random on the street treat me better
I have a pair of her ', none the same
If you see me pulling down the street, don't say "Hello"
Don't send me kisses or messages

[Chorus: Jory Boy & Ñengo Flow]
If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'

If you really don't love me '
You don't look for me '
Do not call me'
Do not judge me'
