Hey Pablo Lyrics [verse 1]
Eight at night local time
I was lost by this city
The Moon was my guide, inside Gran VÃ­a
And without looking for you, you would find me

[Pre-car]
And you came to ask me how you are
How beautiful, you see that you are not here
Oh no no, oh no
[Chorus]
Hey Pablo, I wasn't waiting for you
And you left me here asking for more
A little more, little more
Hey Pablo, you have a gypsy soul
If you had stayed a little more
Little more, tantito more

[Verse 2]
You saw me from afar alone walking
With just one look you made me tremble
I was already imagining, my soul undressing
And unintentionally, silly, say the bad number

[Pre-car]
And you came to ask me how you are
How beautiful, you see that you are not here
Oh no no, oh no

[Chorus]
Hey Pablo, I wasn't waiting for you
And you left me here asking for more
A little more, little more
Hey Pablo, you have a gypsy soul
If you had stayed a little more
Little more, tantito more

From Mexico to Madrid, looking for you in Paris
Tell me where you hide, if you want, I'm going to London
Tell where you hide
From Mexico to Madrid, we do it in Paris
Tell me where you hide, if you want, I'm going to London
Tell where you hide

[Chorus]
Hey Pablo, I wasn't waiting for you
And you left me here asking for more
A little more, little more
Hey Pablo, you have a gypsy soul
If you had stayed a little more
Little more, tantito masembed
