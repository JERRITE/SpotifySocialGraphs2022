I knew Lyrics ["I knew" letter]

[Intro]
Fefe, Show Me What You Got, Ey

[Chorus]
I don't look at how much it costs
'Parties at 50 and the row' tá burst ', eh (yi)
Like 23 in '90
A star detected, the bets changed, huh (Yah!)
I knew that my moment was going to arrive (I was going to arrive; ey)
I knew that my moment was going to arrive (which was going to arrive; ey)
My sixth meaning detects to 'these Feka' (Wuh)
That is why they are not here, h (Ra-Rauw)
[Verse 1]
At Madrugá 'in the study
Colla doesn't record me without a Blunt, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah
Nais, a pair of track sent (ey, ey, ey)
Caleb with the bass, squeezed (Yah, Yah!)
With this song it does not sleep
I'm Ronaldo in Manchester with 7 (Wuh)
We were born blessed, not hopefully (Yih)
Bastards, this is Duars Entertainment with the fuckin 'sensei (ah!)
Bruce reads with the chakos (Wu-Ah)
I hit her, but for my money he forgave me (ey)
In the Lambo I go like my glock's bullet
Carolina taught me to do to '(to', to ')
I have a couple of envious (Yah, Yah!)

[Chorus]
Ya-I don't look at how much it costs
'Parties at 50 and the row' tá burst ', huh
Like 23 in '90
A star is detected, the bets changed, eh (ey)
I knew that my moment was going to arrive (I was going to arrive)
I knew that my moment was going to arrive (which was going to arrive)
My sixth meaning detects to 'this' Feka'
That's why they are not here, huh

[Verse 2]
Baby, I hope you have a good day (day; muah)
Mr. Laguer will escort you at the exit, Yeh-Yeh (Baby)
I told her that I would call her again (-ría; ey, hehe)
But my cell ran out of battery (prr, prr, prr, prr)
The point e 'that vo'a pichar
None will delay me (no), money must be looked for (Yeh)
Until my mai 'guides a Panamera (Straight up)
90 Ready pa 'throw
Bone the check went to change (pah!)
The 'Paca' does not fit in the portfolio (Aching, Ching)
That is why your cat Wanna Fuck Me (Wuh)
If they knew how much Sony (Yuh) deposited
You Fortnite, we pubg (Yeh)
If Buchaca guides never 'caught the poli (plo!)
Stop it, Kenobi

[Interlude]
Mommy, I succeeded, Yeh
Alex, change me a little the flow, change me the lights
Put it on the way, more beautiful, I don't know, more romantic
Ra-Rauw

[Verse 3]
Thinking how we did before
They told me that he is moving, with another he already surpassed me
None will replace you (Wu-Uh)
Like I will make you come (Wu-Uh)
Call the Dealer, which is running out
What makes me distract from you (ey; ra-rauw), huh
Now I have a mansion
There is no na 'of her in my mailbox (Yeh)
I broke his heart (ah)
It was because of my ambition
Not all 'endure pressure (wuh), things like (ey)
Many come, but they have no vision
Thanks for being you the muse of my songs
In this race I run with tentacione'1embed
