Beautiful Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a drug, but it never comes with a warning
When the comedown comes, you know you're gonna be in mourning
The push and pull courtship, yeah, it betrayed us
Now I need something else to fill the space up

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I read between the lines
Holding on to better times
I can’t let it go, I can't let it go
I wanna take back what was mine
But only you can change your mind
I won't let it go, I won’t let it go
[Chorus]
So tell me, what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a bеautiful way
We're fucked up in a bеautiful way
So tell me, what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way

[Verse 2]
Love is a drug, but it never comes with a warning
And if you cut me out, you’ll never hear my side of the story

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I read between the lines
Holding on to better times
I can’t let it go, I can't let it go
I wanna take back what was mine
But only you can change your mind
I won’t let it go, I won't let it go

[Chorus]
So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We’re fucked up in a beautiful way
So tell me what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way

Love, love
I won't let it go, I won't let it go

[Chorus]
So tell me, what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
So tell me, what do you mean
When you say that we're not okay?
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
We're fucked up in a beautiful way
Oh no, yeah
We're fucked up in a beautiful way2Embed
