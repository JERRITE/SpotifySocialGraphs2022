3D Woman Lyrics[제이미 "3D Woman" 가사]

[Verse 1]
They’re chasing my high
Bending over backwards
All the way to forty-five
Yeah, while I’m in the bathtub
I’m just soaking up my life-e-e-e-e
And I ain't gotta try-y-y-y

[Pre-Chorus]
I got 'em captivated
Like the diamond on my bracelet
You can't miss her she glitters in the dark
'Cause they watch me while I'm walking
But they listen while I'm talking
Baby, all of these dimensions
More than you ever thought
[Chorus]
Oh, I, I'm a 3D woman
Oh, I
Yeah, you know that's how I do it
Good things come in threes
I'm a boss n I'm hot 'n I'm sweet, yeah
Oh, I, oh, I'm a 3D woman
3D woman
3D woman
Yeah, oh, I
Oh, I'm a 3D woman

[Verse 2]
(Oh this)
Oh, it's a skirt suit
Working nine to five
Protect my heart so it's bulletproof
Tryna break my wall
I'll let you up but you can't get through (ooh)
Only if I choose you (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I got 'em captivated
Like the diamond on my bracelet
You can't miss her she glitters in the dark
'Cause they watch me while I'm walking
But they listen while I'm talking
Baby, all of these dimensions
More than you ever thought
