Moneygrabber Lyrics[Chorus]
Don't come back anytime, I've already had your kind
This is your pay back, money grabber
Don't come back anytime, you've already robbed me blind
This is your pay back, money grabber

[Verse 1]
Teardrops fade and then I saw
Blue hands in the pocket
'Cause you were always made to want it all
But now you got to make it on your own
This ain't your home
So I'm showin' you the door, wave goodbye
Now it's time for you to go
[Chorus]
Don't come back anytime, I've already had your kind
This is your pay back, money grabber
Don't come back anytime, you've already robbed me blind
This is your pay back, money grabber

[Verse 2]
Blue rhinestone glass, all I see
You talkin' double
Like the time you set fire for me
'Cause I'm in trouble
Here's my advice
I don't pay twice for the price of a cheap dime whore

[Chorus]
Don't come back anytime, I've already had your kind
This is your pay back, money grabber
Don't come back anytime, you've already robbed me blind
This is your pay back, money grabber

[Interlude]
(Oh, one, two, leave)

[Bridge]
Oh, one, is for the money
Two is for the greed
And three times that I told you
That you're the one I just don't need
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't come back anytime, I've already had your kind
This is your pay back, money grabber
Don't come back anytime, you've already robbed me blind
This is your pay back, money grabber

[Post-Chorus]
Money grabber
Money grabber

[Outro]
Don't come back anytime, I've already had your kind
This is your pay back, money grabber
Don't come back anytime, you've already robbed me blindEmbed
