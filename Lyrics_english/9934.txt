Bacc at it Again Lyrics[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Yella Beezy & Quavo]
Oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it, hey, hey)
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again (Woo, hey, hey)
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again (Grraow, hey)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash, Quavo)
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Uh, back at it, back at it, uh
Count up a hundred, throw racks at it, uh
Yeah, my wrist a Titanic, uh
Ice hit the glacier, it do damage (Ice)
Uh, yeah, your nigga gon' panic
I see through her panties like a panoramic (Hey)
Yeah, then get back to whippin'
Then get back to trappin', young nigga back at it (Woo)
Uh, if it's too crowded, might shoot out the roof
And say let 'em come through (Baow, baow)
Keep it one thousand when I'm in the booth
I spent two thousand to step in the shoes (Uh)
Gang on gang, how you think we gon' lose? (Gang)
Back to back motorcade, that's how we move (Woo)
On mama porch, I was sittin' on the stoop (Mama)
When I hopped up, I took off to the moon (Uh)

[Chorus: Yella Beezy & Quavo]
Oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it, hey, hey)
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again (Woo, hey, hey)
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again (Grraow, hey)
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (Cash, cash)

My diamonds like Fiji, bitch, I'm Yella Beezy
Iced out in this freezer, just copped a Luigi
Oh, take it easy, you trippin', I'm leavin'
My drank in the freezer, this shit don't come easy (Damn)
I'm trappin', I mean it, my belt double G me (Damn)
That cooler, the heater, TEC-9, se√±orita
I'll send some shots through a nigga wifebeater
Chopper knock a nigga out of his Fila (Baow)
Don't call me, lil' baby, I'm sorry, don't need ya (Woo)
Last month I got shot, I been went up on features (Damn)
Body for body, my niggas some demons
We tit for tat, leave you busted and bleedin' (Woo)
Stopped in Atlanta, in the booth with my nina
Back in the day, used to trap in the Bimmer
I'm a true hustler, my bitch is a schemer
Skeet in her eyes and that lil' bitch a creamer (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Wrist so froze, I can't shake hands, I gotta give you a pound (Huh)
Way my bank account quadrupled, think I'm still slangin' pounds (Wow)
Told 'em castin' my vote for who tryna get this dope 'cross the border (For sure)
Guwop, I'm from East Atlanta, but stand my ground like it's Florida (Baow)
Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff, fuck the local reporter (Fuck 'em)
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer, Guwop slicker than oil (Oil)
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith, took the trip with the art
Look like a Rolls dealership every time I bring out my cars
Fuckin' stars, buy the bar, neighborhood superstar (It's Gucci)
24K, Bruno Mars down to the drawers (Wop)
I'm thinking' large, talkin' old money, Chico DeBarge (Woah)
Blue 720, futuristic, move when it's parked, it's Gucci

[Chorus: Yella Beezy & Quavo]
Oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm wrappin' again (Whip it)
Keep on playin', bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (Woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (Trappin')
Woo, oh my gosh, back at it again (Back at it, hey, hey)
On my grizzy, nigga stack, stackin' again (Woo, hey, hey)
Big old .40 on me, back packin' again (Grraow, hey)
