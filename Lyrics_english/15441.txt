No one is eternal in the world Lyrics [lyrics of "nobody is eternal in the world"]

[Verse 1]
Nobody is eternal in the world
Nor having a heart
How much feels and sighs
For life and love

[Verse 2]
The years end
Tell me that you take
If there is no time
Neither the grave, nor the cross
[Chorus]
When you say goodbye to me
With the last goodbye of this world
Do not cry to me, that nobody is eternal
No one returns from deep sleep

[Post-car]
You will suffer, you will cry
While you get used to losing
Then you will resign
When you don't see me again

You will suffer, you will cry
While you get used to losing
Then you will resign
When you don't see me again

[Verse 3]
Goodbye to those who stay
I always wanted to sing
Good luck and enjoy her a lot
There is no time to cry

[Verse 4]
Do not cry the one who dies
That forever goes
They will be for those who stay
If you can help them

When you say goodbye to me
With the last goodbye of this world
Do not cry to me, that nobody is eternal
No one returns from deep sleep

[Post-car]
You will suffer, you will cry
While you get used to losing
Then you will resign
When you don't see me again

You will suffer, you will cry
While you get used to losing
Then you will resign
When you don't see me again1embed
