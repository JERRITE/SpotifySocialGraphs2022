Range Rover sport truck (Go)
Range Rover sport truck (Beep)
Range Rover sport truck (Beep)
Bentley Bentayga, bitch sipping Jäger (What?)
Big blunt, picket fence for my neighbors
[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & Lil Keed]
I woke up 3 p.m. just to a lot of paper
Yeah, keep them stacks, flip them racks, don't do favors
Yeah, I'm with D, he do guns, not no tasers
Mhm, and I'm pullin' up with hoes, different flavors (Yeah, Keed, talk to 'em)
Niggas trippin', we shoot it up like a FADER (Grrah, grrah)
Gucci kicks (Ooh), the Virgil bag hold my paper (Guwop)
She coming out, and in between, I'm coming later (Ugh)
Got your hand out, don't say nothin' to me, I don't do favors (Slatt)
Eyes wide, ride deep, my world goin' up
Mob deep, fifty feet, where you from? Throw it up
If I ever call up my bloodas, then they pullin' up
Where he from? Talkin' like he gangster, we gon' beat him up
What he talking 'bout? Like we won't run in his house
Big diamonds shining on me all through the house (Big diamonds)
Fifty bitches (Fifty), fifty rooms, it's going up (Fuck somethin')
Spend a load, get a load, it's all love (Slatt)
I got a

It's a Rolls-Royce, it's a spaceship (Double-R)
It's a PJ, away to Saturn (Oh)
I swear my whole life, I've been chosen (Whole life)
I swapped my old rides out for a foreign
It's a VVS (S), not a SI (I)
It's a new 'Ghini-'Ghini, let the doors fly (Fly)
You lil' boys teeny-weeny, ain't got no pride (Pride)
Give that backend to the trap, they need more pies (Slatt, Keed, talk to 'em)
Talkin' 'bout trap house, talkin' 'bout egg beater (Egg beater)
Talkin' 'bout sippin' syrup (What?), I ain't seen a fever (Drank)
This an Aventador (Tellin' you), like a crawling creature (Roar)
Know you hate it, I know you was a leecher
Red Ferrari, red just like Satan (Skrrt)
I'm not sorry, no, I'm not mistaken (Hoo)
Beat the kitty up (Hoo), leave her body aching (Hoo)
Make her eat up while her booty shaking (Hoo)
