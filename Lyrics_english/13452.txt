La Movie Lyrics [Lyrics for "La Movie" ft. Bad Bunny, Ñengo Flow & Pusho]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
No one believes you, or your Instagram
You are not millo and either street
I am like that, you bastard, do not change
Always real, I don't trust anyone

[Verse 1: Luigi 21 plus]
If you are real meet your word
Man what he speaks supports him
Apply the barking dog saying
Asshole that nobody gets goat
No matter how much heart
A pig is always
(Pig)
These children are in herd
Bowls come out, who came their season
The humble, worms are made
And one in good faith shakes hands
They complain that nobody helps them
But when they grow up, then they don't even greet him
Now they are streets, and what is that?
If illegally they have not been looking for a weight
Say what they say careful ’with that
That you do not solve or your prisoner panas
Lights, cameras, and action
I see another lambe bug in formation
Roncando de Tickets and Armament
And he thinks he is the artist of the moment
They claim to be loyal, but to be loyal you have to try
And although loyalty on paper is not signed (hey)
Bastard this is confirmed
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
Yeh, Yeh
Bastards already lower the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na
They have no na, Yeh

[Verse 2: Ñengo Flow]
Many talk about loyalty without knowing her
They can't keep it because they are not real
For me to die to ’the bastard that does not work
For me he dies, I remain firm
The monastery, there is a poison for your arteries
Your life is a comedy and I am the owner of the fair
False singers will die, where they come they will go
Black and white the ying yang, the r is riddled, I
Fame makes them crazy
Rats are rats, I'm not mistaken
Mere mamabicho better down the mucus
Mere So, son 'e buck you will give you a few
Do not ignore your luck
That walks with a glitter to death
Crazy I'm about to see you
Pa ’take out the helmets for the glass in front
I kill the falsehood and burial to hypocrisy
We are still active, what?
Ñengo in nobody trusts
Ñengo puts the comb and empty the comb
Embustos artists then do not frustrate
I get pa ’, you will go settings
Although an army recruit they come
What are we going to see when the AK is pusted

Yeh, Yeh
Bastards already lower the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na
They have no na, Yeh

[Verse 3: Push]
I'm with Mercedes Deportivo
I walk with two children that are impulsive
Hunting a pair of fugitive piglets that escaped me
But they are more dead than alive
What I live almost never writes
And what I write almost never live it
What I'm looking for is an excuse, a reason
To drag them amarrao ’from the stirrups
My car is balance, my house is salad
And these colleagues fighting for skirts
The bug macked me the singer
The Chorist, the DJ, and even your bodyguard
With me avoid the rose to put you in I already have the pose
Bastard, you and your boss know me
Don't make me put the twelve in my mouth
They see me and break row, ah
I have never run through piles in my life
Leave the tide quiet
That my combo is mine, children, yours you rent it
I recommend that you ask for help
That he will not take you or flowers, the widow
Keep betting on the saint and Buddha
Until the hurricane shakes you (Pusho)
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
Yeh, Yeh
Bastards already lower the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
That the world knows who you are already, Yeh
Bastards are already the movie
They pass border and have no na
They have no na, Yeh
