Going With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you call out my name
I'll go from miles away
From high and low
I'll be around
When you wanna be found
Just call out my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Just tell me the truth
And you said
[Chorus]
Wherever you're going, I'm going too
I don't care where we're going, I'm going with you
You know I'm going with you
You know I'm going with you

[Verse 2]
And then I dreamt of all the things we could be
You sang my songs in the night
So I believe that when the light falls
There's only you and I
So I said

[Chorus]
Wherever you're going, I'm going too
I don't care where we're going, I'm going with you
I said
Wherever you're going, I'm going too (Going too)
I don't care where we're going, I'm going with you
You know I'm going with you
You know I'm going with you
You know I'm going with you
You know I'm going with youYou might also likeEmbed
