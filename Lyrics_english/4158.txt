I have you today, but maybe tomorrow you
What are you playing? Yes already (OH-OH-OH-OH)
The Do 'Calemo', there is no turning back (let's go!)

[Chorus: Jhay Cortez & Wisin]
No one does it as you know 'do
That little body is not mine, but I am faithful
If you don't want to 'leave, I don't want to drink
But when I am hungry no 'can' eat (Mr. W)
No one does as you know 'doing (woh-oh-oh-oh)
That little body does not e 'mine, but I am faithful (tra, tra, tra)
If you don't want to 'leave, I don't want to drink (what you say is done)
But when you are hungry no 'can eat' eat (from the base)

With photo 'Without clothes, he tells me: "I miss you"
