The gossip lyrics [pre-car]
Today I see you with him
And your skin comes to mind
I couldn't explain
How were things
I losing, I burned our time
There's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Nena arrived with an incredible gossip
And you believed them, of course you did it
Things of the past left us scars
I am leaving today, even if I didn't want to go
[Verse 1]
And what to beg
If it is the end of an never ending discussion
They filled you with doubts, the moon lowered you
He won you insecurity
And even if you are not, I know that later
Your heart will want to come back
For the things he left in my bed
If not that pride beats you
I would like to stay but I have to go
Ah-ahh

[Chorus]
Nena arrived with an incredible gossip
And you believed them, of course you did it
Things of the past left us scars
I am leaving today, even if I didn't want to go

Nena arrived with an incredible gossip
And you believed them, of course you did it
Things of the past left us scars
I am leaving today, even if I didn't want to go

Hey baby, they saw you talking about
That you are missing me
Oh what a shame gives me a woman
You might Also Likeoye Nena, they saw you talking about
That you are missing me
And pride is power

[Pre-car]
Today I see you with him
And your skin comes to mind
I couldn't explain
How were things
I losing, I burned our time
There's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Nena arrived with an incredible gossip
And you believed them, of course you did it
Things of the past left us scars
I am leaving today, even if I didn't want to go
