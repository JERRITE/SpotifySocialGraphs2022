Without fear lyrics [letter of "without fear"]

[Chorus]
I am not afraid of what can happen
A couple of the year 'there was no na' to lose
What else gives this life and what happens to the end, if
We already fulfilled to 'what we swore, Yeah-Yeah
Don't ask for me, mommy, I'm going to be fine
It doesn't matter where, Yeah
If one day I'm no longer, ma ', don't cry for me
You remember my name, Yeah, Yeah
[Verse]
Mom, don't be afraid
Envy always comes when you're touching the sky
I keep it fresh, I almost had a new
I go again if you make me start from scratch
I get as I want, Yeah, Oh-Yeah
Thanks to the microphone now swim in pool
I like the area, also the neighbor
Gold records in the showcase
Money every time I apartment the cabin, drunk flow Sabina
I don't know how many days I forgotten
The way you had to talk to me, ma ', I have to take care of myself
Life is giving me on the rib 'without gloves, businesses apart
Money does not buy freedom and that's what I want to be
Free without need ', while there is pa' eating
And if one day I die, Mama, I leave the bank full
And pay my brother some good studies
That does not come out like me, that with 15 I lost
If it weren't for Music, what would it be of me?
Mommy, this depression does not let me sleep
With what some would give here, hey
I did everything I said I wouldn't do (OH-OH)
I blame others when I was mine (OH-OH)
Mommy, I was so lost that I didn't even know
If I didn't know how to take care of you, bad mine
I wanted to hit myself like Bunny or Rosalia
Party and another party to 'the days (ah-ah)
But this world, mommy, is whyeh (Yeah)
I know we'll laugh one day
Four year 'tour without stopping
Babies in the party who want to fuck me
For being who I am, not for anything special, heh
And again drunk in a presidential, hey, hey
Now so drugged and I swore that I was not going to do it (ah-ah)
Now so sad, another concert (OH-OH-OH)
Around me happening things that I don't understand
All my friend 'I was just fucking
For every million, Baby, I lose a few
Stop the phone, stay the contacts
Stay the managers and to 'the contracts
I want to be free, baby, I don't ask so much
And now I'm living in a mental prison and I can't escape
I'm trying to go far to start over
Baby, the fame of fame is giving me anxiety
And as much as I take, this penalty is not going
Counting pasta, returning in Business, Yeah (OH-OH-OH)
Thinking about everything you told me (OH-OH-OH)
That all that money was going to serve me (OH-OH-OH)
If when nobody comes to receive me, hey

What else gives this life and what happens to the end, if
We already fulfilled to 'what we swore, Yeah-Yeah

It doesn't matter where, Yeah
If one day I'm no longer, ma ', don't cry for me
You remember my name

[Outro]
I am not afraid of what can happen
A couple of the year 'there was no na' to lose (Yeh-eh)
What else gives this life and what happens to the end if
We already fulfilled to 'what we swore, Yeah-Yeah
Don't ask for me, mommy, I'm going to be fine
It doesn't matter where, Yeah
If one day I'm no longer, ma ', don't cry for me
You remember my name, Yeah, Yeah1embed
