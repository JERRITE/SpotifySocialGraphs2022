The shameless lyrics [stanza 1]
She is a shameless for being the most beautiful
He has almost nothing but he likes face life
And I like her and I know how much loves me
I know he dreams with me but dawns in another bed

[Pre-car]
Money stole his heart
The lies broke off his soul
And his pain hurts much more than his betrayal
I was born to love her even if she leaves
[Chorus]
Nobody Woman, Woman of all, a woman who kills
Woman who hurts, a woman who gives and snatches you
Woman so expensive, ungrateful woman
I know you will not forget even if you leave
I know you will not forget even if you leave

[Stanza 2]
In my wallet I keep your worn photo
It is my greatest fortune and my unfortunate
I will follow my rumba, the world does not end
This life is very short, it charges you and pays you

[Pre-car]
And it is that money stole his heart
The lies broke off his soul
And his pain hurts much more than his betrayal
I was born to love her even if she leaves

[Chorus]
Nobody Woman, Woman of all, a woman who kills
Woman who hurts, a woman who gives and snatches you
Woman so expensive, ungrateful woman
I know you will not forget even if you go, shameless

[Chorus]
Nobody Woman, Woman of all, a woman who kills
Woman who hurts, a woman who gives and snatches you
Woman so expensive, ungrateful woman
I know you will not forget even if you leave
I know you will not forget even if you leave
I know you will not forget even if you go a might also likembed
