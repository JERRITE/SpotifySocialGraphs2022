[Chorus: Morgenshtern]
E-E -el Primero with a huge cher
I have a problem: Lambo 'or Ferra ’?
E-E -el Primero with a huge cher
I have a problem: Lambo 'or Ferra'?

[Verse 1: Morgenshtern]
Hey, hear
I am a young boss, you are a stupid mouse (mouse)
I am making money while you fuck (cache)
Chains on me are thousands of thousand (five cartoons, hey)
I have never saved up anyway (no)
Fucked rap because he loved (mm)
I make bombs, but I'm not from iga -

[Chorus: Morgenshtern]
E-E-E-EL Primero with a huge cher
I have a problem: Lambo ’or Ferra '?
E-E -el Primero with a huge cher
I have a problem: Lambo 'or Ferra'? (Uh-e-e)
[Verse 2: Timati & Morgenshtern]
I have an urgent question:
Choose yourself Rolls-Royce or Royce-Rolls?
This is Big Boys Playing Big Toys
Timati in the club - they know who I am
- Hey, wake up! The twentieth year in the yard
- Okay.
Big Boys Playing with Big Toys (Big Toys)
I am legendary as Pink Floyd (Pink Floyd)
I'm on Ferrari like Big Boss (Big Boss)
A chain on me like your house (Bling)
Hey, I fuck there like you (like you)
Torn contracts (e-e)
Timati began to do better (what?)
When left Blackstar

[Chorus: Morgenshtern]
El Primero with a huge dick
I have a problem: Lambo 'or Ferra'?
E-E -el Primero with a huge cher
I have a problem: Lambo 'or Ferra ’?
