[Intro: ysy a]
If I say "fifth", you say "step"
Fifth!, Step!
Fifth!, Step!
Fifth!, Step!

[Verse 1: duki]
The miracle of Sandra and Guille born on June 24 'E
Little warrior who plans to beat the fist ’
I went to the street, put in rap and left the studies'
And I found meaning to my life when I got into a study
And I hit my first song, and although I had no money, I thought I was a millionaire
The first Argentine rapper to have stuck from my neighborhood
And I didn't have nothing, we were so lacked, but I put him like a warrior
And I started to see money with tour ', bowling' until you reach the stage '
And I talk to you about ’, which I wasn't me alone, Shout-Out for Devil Mode
Al Ysy and the Neo, know that I love you, I think of you daily
I went through hell and I could leave when I thought it necessary
And in the end I did not fall, I became stronger to the surprise of several
My life seems very easy in the eyes of a stranger
But the pressures become larger 'and the fear' take more size
A career that I had with high ’more than five years’
Start 'playing for thirty person' and now you fill you 'the stadium
[Chorus: duki]
Drops inside my glass
I feel that everyone judges me when I take a step
They speak as if they did not know the failure
Many give up, but it's not the case

[Verse 2: duki]
From sun to sun training the flows', improving the bar ’, leaving life
I give way 'giant' and the footprint is so great that nothing erases it and nobody forgets them
My people are humble, you know about a family, you will not deny you a dish 'e food (no, no, no)
The Lejo Stadium 'looks like a spacecraft if I have my people on (Shoot)
My faith to the right, my group on the left
This shark there is no hook that bites
I'm not going to stop as long as I have my leg '
I'm not going to die while living my lyrics'
My two arm ', my gun' of war
My brain is a business key '
The secret 'I keep them in the language
My word 'are pa' to swallow them, so that they listen to or pa 'that bite them
The 'good' act does not take place, but deep down each one remembers (no, no)
Life hit me in front, I woke up and I have it between the rope '
Gracia 'To my people and my family for helping me out of shit

[Chorus: duki]
Drops inside my glass
I feel that everyone judges me when I take a step
They speak as if they did not know the failure
Many give up, but it's not the case

I went out to look for it, mommy, I didn't ask for it
The law of the strongest talks about me
I kill the race, rest in peace
Byza made the goal, I attended it
Bottle fly ', I fell with my team
The rest still as a mannequin
If they talk about mine, they talk about the elite
If they talk about Trap, 'Tan talking about me (Duko!)

[Verse 3: duki]
My life a movie, my group the cast
I'm not good, I have talent
I arrived well dressed and I stole the event
I do not leave the area, I think Shevchenko
The 512 has me feeling Sonic, next to me were slow '(very slow')
If you want to see Dio ', I present them (Dori Me)
On the back the Argentine flag
With the zapas in sports mode (dori me)
Vo'a keep rapping, mommy, for life
I knew I was going to keep mine real if I didn't sell me (Dori Me)
I fulfilled my rapper mission, I bought the house I wanted, ah-ah

[Outro: duki]
It's the Duko, You Know
Argentina is in the house, Devil Mode is at home
You already knew, mommy
Louder and louder, louder
After so many years I would not say "luck"
Louder and louder, louder
After so many years I would not say "luck"
It's a wrap4mbed
