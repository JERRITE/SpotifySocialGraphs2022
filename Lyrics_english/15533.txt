The illusion of the first love lyricsni friends know what happens to me but I get in looking at you
When we went for a walk after class I always finish
Near you
I can't anymore I will have to tell you
With the illusion of the first desperate love I love you
With the passion of the first love that I loved I love you
I do not fit in the body the love that I have
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
All your natural gestures can with me that
I'm going to do
I like you so much that I look at you and I don't even need more and more every time
I'm going to learn to bring you to the network
With the illusion of the first desperate love t I love
With the passion of the first love that I loved me
I do not fit in the body the love that I have
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
With the illusion of the first desperate love I love you
With the passion of the first love that I loved I love you
With the illusion of the first desperate love I love you
With the passion of the first love that I loved me
I do not fit in the body the love that I have
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
With the illusion of the first desperate love I love you
With the passion of the first love that I loved I love you
With the illusion of the first desperate love I love you
With the passion of the first love that I loved me
I do not fit in the body the love that I have
I don't don't
