​moonlit room Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
No, oh
No, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh (Oh), oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh (Oh), oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder
Wonder if you wanna leave, if I told ya
All the things you didn't see
Am I wrong for thinkin' that we met way too soon?
[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes it hurts, and I don't fight first
I don't want anything that ever mattered
To be caught up in your shadow, baby
Tears on my shirt
'Cause I loved you at your worst
Lookin' into my eyes, let me know you listen
'Cause you never listenin', ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
Dancin' across this moonlit room (Ooh, ooh)
Thinkin' about you way too soon (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I'm in love with the wrong things that you do (Do, ooh)
Makin' my way back back to you (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, ooh, oh, oh

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it seems like, every day
You and I got the same things that we workin' on
Goin' through
Rеason why I'm still stuck with you
When highs turn to low
And the sky hits the floor, I keep coming back
'Causе maybe I, just like the way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
That sometimes it hurts (It hurts), and I don't fight first (Fight first)
I don't want anything that ever mattered
To be caught up in your shadow, baby
Tears on my shirt (Shirt)
'Cause I loved you at your worst (Your worst)
Lookin' into my eyes, let me know you listen
'Cause you never listenin', ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
Dancin' across this moonlit room (Ooh, ooh)
Thinkin' about you way too soon (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I'm in love with the wrong things that you do (Do, ooh)
Makin' my way back back to you (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
When I gave you better than you ever had it, you run
See, you took the pleasure and I took the pain, made me numb
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Dancin' across this moonlit room
Thinkin' about you way too soon (Thinkin' about you, I'm in love)
I'm in love with the wrong things that you do (That you do)
Makin' my way back back to you (Ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
(Thinkin' about you)
Dancin' across this moonlit room
