The strength of the heart LyricsMírame
I get nothing to concentrate
I am clueless I do everything wrong
I am a disaster and I don't know

What's going on
I like to rage I wish you
You get to despair
What I feel for you is so great

What to have you will not be enough
That what invites me to live
That gives me the illusion
What will that force be
That all binds to two by two
It will be the strength of the heart
Makes it hugged you
And the bodies get to hinder
I tremble only with the idea of ​​touching

Your lips full of new kisses
I can't sleep you steal my tranquility
Someone has embroidered
Your body with threads of my anxiety

Of your belt your legs crossed
From my back a clock
Where your fingers are the needles
That give strength to this engine

What is the strength of the heart
And it's the force that takes you
That pushes you and that fills you
That drags you and brings you closer to God

It is a feeling almost an obsession
If the force is from the heart
It is something that lies the power discharge
That you take your reason

It makes you stumble
Sure is the strength of the heart
It's something that takes you
I can not think
You might Also would like to take care of me more
How little I lose my life and then you give it to me
WHAT IS WHAT IS FLOWING TO THE LOOR
That goes out of the Lord

And it's nothing more than a mischievous boy
Provocative will be the strength of the heart
And it's the force that takes you
That pushes you and that fills you
That drags you and brings you closer to God

It is a feeling almost an obsession
If the force is from the heart
It is something that lies the power discharge
That you take your reason

It makes you stumble
Sure is the strength of the heart
It's something that takes you .... embed
