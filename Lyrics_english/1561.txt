Bowie On The Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
New York City on an April night
I'm not religious but the Passover meal was fine
So was the art, so was the wine
Man, there’s McEnroe talking to a friend of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights flickering in your car
We drove fast but I took it in slowly
I swear I felt every beat of my heart
And just when I thought it couldn't get better
[Chorus]
They put Bowie on the radio
Just like they had a million times before
Felt like the first time that I heard it though
For a moment, we were heroes, heroes

[Verse 2]
I'd never seen the New York sky so bright
I swear I saw a shooting star or a satellite
Was lost in space and I was lost in time
It might be late but I’m feeling alright

[Pre-Chorus]
City lights flickering in your car
We drove fast but I took it in slowly
I swear I felt every beat of my heart
And just when I thought it couldn't get better

[Chorus]
They put Bowie on the radio
Just like they had a million times before
Felt like the first time that I heard it though
For a moment, we were heroes, heroes

[Bridge]
And I don't remember the name of the writer that spoke that night
But I'll never forget the way that she made me smile
I left that city in the morning light
I caught my flight but, damn, did I cut it fine
Couldn't help but wish that I could hit rewind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
To city lights flickering in your car
We drove fast but I took it in slowly
I swear I felt every beat of my heart
And just when I thought it couldn't get better

[Chorus]
They put Bowie on the radio
Just like a hundred, million times before
Felt like the first time that I heard it though
For a moment, we were heroes
They put Bowie on the radio
Just like a hundred, million times before
Felt like the first time that I heard it though
For a moment, we were heroes
They put Bowie on the radio
Just like they had a million times before
Felt like the first time that I heard it though
For a moment, we were heroes, heroes2Embed
