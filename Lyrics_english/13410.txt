TranslationEnglishdesperados Lyrics ["desperate" letter]]

[Pre-stribe: Rauw Alejandro, Chencho Corleone]
What did you do to me?
That I want to see her again
And kiss her again
I go looking for you, search
Is that the beautiful with you
With anyone else I get it
I don't forget your cry, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro, Rauw Alejandro & Chencho Corleone]
I have reserved the hotel, but with these it wins 'I do not come' to arrive
Somo 'do' desperate ', that's why I had us to park
Atrá 'the seat awaits us
You are an adventure when naked ', -a-as
You-teo resident the hotel, but with еstas wins 'I don't vamo' arrive
Somo 'do' desperate ', that's why I had us to park
Atrá 'the seat awaits us
You are an adventure when naked ', -a-as

[Verse 1: Concho Corleone]
The 'wins' of having it, I couldn't, I had
To do it when I stopped, I sweat
In the 'e Atrá', although it is lacking comfort
Your shout 'confirmed that you saw the' cloud '
Beautiful dominates us whenever you and I don't 'vemo'
No matter the environment, where not 'eat'
There is no planning because the situation
Uncontrolled you and there is no way to avoid the situation
Where we always end without clothes
Do not settle for a kiss on the mouth
According to you, I am the one who causes you
But it seeks me 'although he knows' that I have another

[Chorus: Chencho Corleone & Rauw Alejandro]
You-do I have reserved the hotel, but with these it wins 'I do not come' to arrive
Somo 'do' desperate, that's why we had to march
The seat awaits us
You are an adventure when naked ', -a-a-a'

Ah, mommy, do you want 'more, you want' more, you want 'more? (Wuh)
