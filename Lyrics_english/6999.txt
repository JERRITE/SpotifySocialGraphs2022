My World Lyrics [Words of "My World"]

[Verse 1]
As in Colombia, armed to the teeth it is the Amazon
As in Colombia, armed to the teeth it is the Amazon
Do not play Mia too much, you have littleadays are reliable
Don't look for it, to chagrate, you would need a miracle
What are you playing there? Do you think I’m your friend, who did you take me for?
You opened my eyes, ouh, mamma mia
You piss me off, and I’m hitting people there
I will not judge me without knowing who you are, when I feel weak I Depend to God to raise me
(God to unravel me, God to unravel me), I need to empty
[Pre-refrain]
You are there you make me the killer, you are only a bouncer
There's nothing fantastic, I am entering asics
So come in my world, you're there you don't see you deuh
You're here you get me, you smoke plastic

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Move your body, move your body
Oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo, oh
Move your body, move your body
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Move your body, move your body
Oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo, oh

[Verse 2]
Who do you want to shoot? Not far away you will go
You will walk, you will go up, and later we will kill you
It is the law of the environment, where weapons and go there is
It loads you as in bullfight, there is no point in doing the gorilla
You loose you laugh, now you're here
Fortunately I sorted, I don't regret
And I dodge all these biatchs, on pépé they make the grill
They don't bite, cry, look for a sequel to Kyriad
And then nothing I am gamber, there is no point in talking
I did things in my own way, so much better than it worked
A little honey I get into the air, kidney stroke she shouts my name
Two-three beautiful words in the air, and she says to me: "You're my man"

You are there you make me the killer, you are only a bouncer
There's nothing fantastic, I am entering asics
So come in my world, you're there you don't see you deuh
You're here you get me, you smoke plastic

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Move your body, move your body
Oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo, oh

[Pre-refrain]
You are there you make me the killer, you are only a bouncer
There's nothing fantastic, I am entering asics
So come in my world, you're there you don't see you deuh
You're here you get me, you smoke plastic

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Move your body, move your body
Oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo, oh

[Pre-refrain]
There's nothing fantastic, I am entering asics
So come in my world, you're there you don't see you deuh
You're here you get me, you smoke plastic
There's nothing fantastic, I am entering asics
So come in my world, you're there you don't see you deuh
You're here you get me, you smoke plastic16embed
