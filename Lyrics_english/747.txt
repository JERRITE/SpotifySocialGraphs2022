Cheque Lyrics[Verse 1: Loski]
I step in Margiela, my barbie look better
Ayy I'm Loose are you buzzing?
Ching you in designer Italian cutting
Bluffing, I know them boy are on nuttin'
How many times have they dashed?
Splash and brag, gyaldem love it
Cool kid block hot, oohh can't touch him
Drop on the pagans, we start bussing
Can't chat for the kid
18 with more bags than my age, are you taking the piss?
Pole on me still taking a risk
I'll boot at your camera, no Hood Politic vids
And I ain't ever on a gossiping ting
Ayy talk on my name, get touched I'm round a whole load of things
Them man are brass go manage your figs
Fendi or D Squared, don't care or it's Gucci the print
[Chorus: Loski]
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set

[Verse 2: Asco]
It's like Asc' and Losk' on a track that's waves
Seasick you can't take man for a eediat
Violate, gunshots ringing out immediate, huh
Light your whole block like a weed spliff, huh
Made a 10 racks on a week shift
Put another 5 down on the weekend
Moretime she be saying that she hate me, I hit her with the pipe then she saying she don't mean it
AP buss down on my Meek shit
VS clean cut on my clean drip
Youngen nine fifth back from a mean whip
Broke it all down, 9 of each up on each strip (truss)
And none of them man there live what they chat, dem man dere just rap
Me, I be really in the trap, see my trapline bangs and I cop hella straps for the gang

[Chorus: Loski]
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set

Niggas talk wass on tracks, man cop big jewels and tope this smoke
Move a HP in 2 weeks that's trips on trips nigga, going up so
I ain't beefing you if you ain't seeing over 50
I'm treating niggas my age like some pickney
Nah they won't come to the lane cah' that's risky
Roof garn bang it, no lacking when he tipsy
I ain't a rapper doe, I just trap a lot
I came in the game with more P's than all these rappers got
Huh, so don't mix me with no mediness
I drop a 5 bills on a quick pair of Adidas'
9 on my Valentino jacket, my Louis game spazzing
She would've thought I'm sponsored in Harrods
Big man B-Eazy, we splash easy
For the set all my bros be attacking

[Chorus: Loski]
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set
Babygirl I run up a cheque, and I don't take checks
I tell them boy mind where you step
She like that I go through bands, and smoke on man
I told her that it's all for the set1Embed
