I released lyrics [lyrics by "I freed myself"]

[Intro]
I released myself, I released
Thank God I released myself
I released myself, I released
Thanks to heaven I freed myself

[Verse 1]
I freed myself from perverse women
What do you want to make my life of squares
I freed myself from unscrupulous girls
I freed myself from Oria and Safety
I freed myself from Nancy, from Rebeca, from Olga
Damaris, Helga and Giselle
I also freed myself from Raquel
Thank God I will free me
I freed myself from Mariela and faith
Thanks to heaven I free me
I freed myself from perverse women
What do you want to make my life of squares
I freed myself from unscrupulous girls
I freed myself from Oria and Safety
I freed myself from Nancy, from Rebeca, from Olga
Damaris, Helga and Giselle
I also freed myself from Raquel
Thank God I will free me
I freed myself from Mariela and faith
Thanks to heaven I free me

[Verse 2]
They all insulted me
They told me "Mujeriego, I will not let you live in peace
Wherever I find you "
And I don't know why it will be
But that they all insulted me
They told me "Mujeriego, I will not let you live in peace
Wherever I find you "
And I wonder, and I don't explain what reason they will have
That's why I had to do it

[Bridge]
I released myself, I released
Thank God I released myself
I released myself, I released
Thanks to heaven I freed myself

(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
There were so many pressures that I put on my skates
I got in Bolina and I had to run
(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
Selfish women loved me only for them
For them nothing more, and so it cannot be
(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
I remember my mother when I told them
"Blessed, if he is a good boy, if that is a good man"
(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
I want to tell everyone you have to share it
And if not, I'M Sorry, Goodbye My Girl

(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
I am free (I released myself, I released myself)
(I don't want more complications, that's why I released myself)
And I don't owe anyone (I released myself, I released myself)

[Saying]
(I don't want more complications for what?)
Of shadows and that forgetfulness and I don't want to know
(I don't want more complications for what?)
To enjoy free without problem, good life I will give me
Yes, I (I released, I released)
I freed myself (I released myself, I released myself)
Yes, I (I released, I released)
I freed myself (I released myself, I released myself)
(I don't want more complications for what?)
I don't want to tell me what I have to do
(I don't want more complications for what?)
That I do not want to sing, everything I tired of everything

I freed myself (I released myself, I released myself)
Yes, I (I released, I released)
I freed myself (I released myself, I released myself)
