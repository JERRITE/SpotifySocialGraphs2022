Kidnap Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got that bottom of the ocean
Pressure, pressure
Pushing down on me, you know
Got that out in outer space kind
Pressure, pressure
Thinking my body might explode

[Chorus]
Shackle me up and lock it
I could live in your pocket
When you gonna kidnap me?
When you gonna kidnap me?
Take me away from here
I could see it so clear
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me

[Verse 2]
So call the cops and tell them
I've gone missing, missing
They throw the case into the pile

And call my mom and tell her
Don't you worry, worry
I'll see you in a little while

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, ya never gonna catch us
Oh, ya never gonna catch us
Oh, ya never gonna catch us

And anyway I need to
And anyway I need you

[Chorus]
You might also like[Chorus - Variation]
Tie me up to a chair
I could live in your hair
When you gonna kidnap me?
When you gonna kidnap me?

Take me away from here
I could see it so clear
You gotta kidnap me
You gotta kidnap me3Embed
