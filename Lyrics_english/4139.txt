[Verse 4: Myke Towers & Lunay]
Ask me to pay for it and all those who touch you
She is the sensation of the block
And lower mirrors like the boster
The lowest thing I used is Lacoste
And my behavior is already normal for them to adopt it (ah, yeah)
Baby, I look for the ticket 'daily, but the weekly room
Low profile for nobody knows'
And she wants to keep burning, reserve another mushroom
Supposedly at night becomes Satan
On the wrist an Audemars, much in the high seas
If he does not buy you Chanel, then Baby, change channel
It is assigned to the Can-AM
I do what they won't do you
Baby, never forget: money kills Galán (Lu-Lu-Lunay, haha)

[Verse 5: Lunay]
That nobody knows where we will be '
But that is what I do '(-emo')
You like Frontear (-ar)
And I will pay you (-ar)
Flow Natti Natasha, has made you a criminal, Yeh-Yeah
Of to'ita her e 'la má' that grows (-ece)
As to 'mi' interest '(-e-e)
You criticize me '(-ica')
And what hates you is that in your life you have not achieved what I have already done in eight mese ''
In the private jet, forty thousand feet
And I know that he leaves the foot of the foot 'at the waist, eh-yyah
The fool of your former snoring and walks in a law 8
I'm going for a penthouse and I only have 18

[Verse 6: Almighty]
I have to pay for
Not like your boyfriend that what he buys wants to post
Mine is riding you in the jetco
The other whores see me on the beach and fisco
Yeh, I put you with Perco
Wuh, I stay like Velcro
Mommy, with me, if I want it escapes you '
To your sister the bribe, she covers us
I rob you like Harry, with the cape
You like the boat '
To me culote '
I do 'a business that I
I take to cross the border like Coyote
The card that explodes, which I solve
I under bags full of ticket ', I don't believe in the salary, Yeh
He took the eye 'to the crow'
I get tonight and after I come back
When he is capota, I observe her
You are my favorite, I keep you
IT's "The Game Changer", Almighty

[Choir: Jhay Cortez]
Today I am Pa 'Ti (Yeah)

Moñas pa 'burn (-mar)

[Verse 7: Rafa Pabön]
Pulling the 'chavo' as an actor pa 'the '90
They fall if they do not walk along the line like Wallenda
I bring kripa pa 'that pledge' and tusi pa 'what turns on'
I prefer to spend on you rather than pay them on the Treasury
Mommy, what you ask for I am going to pay
I have to pay for, I don't go 'to mistake
I am not like others, I do not live to movie (Yeah)
But I have ticke 'pa' take all 'your friend' and put it 'in my room to twerkear
I border on me to border
First you have to bill
Corduroy 'they have to upload because I don't get off
Magic Johnson by Point Guard
Impossible shot 'to fail
And this is just one night, don't go in love

[Verse 8: brray]
(Brray, Brray)
I will charge you (Yeah)
There are more 'pa' spent (Yes)
3 thousand in the combi and I go out to kill, Yeah (BRR)
There is much envious that in my place I would like to be (Sheesh)
But they have to prepare the monthly income in my weekly gain
From before 'to sing my account not for' e win (prr)
They have told me about you, that you like anal sex (ah)
Find a bug and you just crown
The power is already ready if today puts you 'pa' the return (SA)
Today the kiosk 'taba active and broken' Las Venta '
Ask what I want 'I run with the account (Shiuf)
And Martino takes out the 40 in Inventa (Sheesh)

[Verse 9: Álvaro Díaz]
I am not looking bad (no)
And tell your whore to stop (tell him)
Like cardi, he loves me to twerkear (and you in the bad)
As offset, not for 'e cry (huh)
Today no 'vamo' of Shopping (Yeah)
Command to close a place
Buy
Always Ballin ', Lonzo Ball (Ouh)
Your Jevo Viste To 'Gucci, but you [?] In a york
I gave it to 'my crush, I had to make another list (no)
They see them mine and hire stylists
Your cats like old photos in my Insta
Hey, if it's no longer so fine because I broke the clues (prr)
Hey Hey hey
