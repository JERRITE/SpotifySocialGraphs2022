The country of never Lyricsletra from "the country of never"

[Verse]
When the moon goes out
And the universe catches you
Then you will understand
When your star tells you
That you no longer have a way out
You will look back

And you won't have who to call
Nothing to save
And you won't have where to go
Much less here
[Verse 2]
When your luck ends
And lose what you won
You will know what was from love
And when you feel the same
That I feel in this abyss
You will try to return

[Chorus]
Your song is no longer my song
You know my voice has just given
The final note
But finally only for you
Live in the country
Ever

[Verse 3]
When your sky clouds
And notice how you sink
You will know what I went to you
I only remember
Of our early days
A love between a thousand

And you won't have who to call
Nothing to save
And you won't have where to go
Much less here

Your song is no longer my song
You know my voice has just given
The final note
But finally only for you
Live in the country
Ever

And you won't have where to go
Much less here

[Chorus]
Your song is no longer my song
You know my voice has just given
The final note
But finally only for you
Live in the country
Ever

[Chorus]
Your song is no longer my song
You know my voice has just given
The final note
But finally for trembed
