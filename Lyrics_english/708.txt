Thinking Lyrics [lyrics by "Thinking"]

[Chorus]
I'm lost at night thinking
I'm going to 110 thinking
And if you want to come back, call me
And I take you at Benz
I'm lost at night thinking
I'm going to 110 thinking
And if you want to come back, call me
And I take you at Benz
[Verse]
I do not forget what we did in the capital
I want to take that mouth again
I have visions of having you here taking rosé with you in front of the sea (ey)
Look how crazy about yours and mine
That anuqué have boyfriend I am the favorite
To 'I remember them' go to oblivion
I know you like it even forbidden

[Chorus]
I'm lost at night thinking
I'm going to 110 thinking
And if you want to come back, call me
And I take you at Benz

[Verse 2]
Is already dawning and I don't see the message
I'm going crazy by skiding in the street
I think this is over
Even if you got to '(woh)
Maybe was the best
Give me something for pain
Red turned blue
Cold as coffin
It seems that you
You left southern pal
It's just that there is no one like you
Cold but with glamor
Strong as Excálibur (Yeah)
Ma write to me since I'm going to look for you (Yeah)
Come only once girl
Come

I'm lost at night thinking
I'm going to 110 thinking
And if you want to come back, call me
And I take you at Benzembed
