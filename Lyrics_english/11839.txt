I am a Don Lyrics [intro]
Is what you say
This is a pod like oil
Pa 'take us from the street
Mozart la Para y Juan Mag√°n
Let's go to the game that there is no timber pa 'los haater

[Chorus]
In Europe I am a Dale Dale (EEH)
Santo Domingo a Tigeron Dale (AAH)
Colombia a couple
Puerto Rico a bastard
Vamo 'night per million
Tell me cordo ma 'where are the gays
[See 1]
She just wants alcohol
Tobacco and rum
And the party turns on
He gets Bacana if I arrive
Shining like sun
The glow
He doesn't look at me, his mouth bites
Ah-Ah pants approaches
Your ta rega 'to night
Damo 'A Tour in my Hey Car
Dolce Hey Prada Dress Taconsito Prada
That the car's glass is determined

[Chorus]
And in Europe I am a Dale Dale (EEH)
Santo Domingo a Tigeron Dale (AAH)
Colombia a couple
Puerto Rico a bastard
Vamo 'night per million
Tell me cordo ma 'where are the gays

[See 2]
Where are the hunting leather
The single and married
Las Chapieras Las Flacas Culonas
Where are the interested parties
Mandala to private access
To have private sex
To grab her from the bun and pull it
Where curly

The women that was in their asphyxie
I don't first do it
Because you are maintenance
And we Chamaquito Ghetto
I got it effective
Were we to do juitero?
That is why he lacked respect for money

[Chorus]
And in Europe I am a Dale Dale (EEH)
Santo Domingo a Tigeron Dale (AAH)
Colombia a couple
Puerto Rico a bastard
Vamo 'night per million
Tell me cordo ma 'where are the gays

[Bridge]
Let's go to the game
We go to the game
That there is no timber pa 'lo hater
Turn on the machine
Nama 'you have to give it
And indeed the aroma paints and pedal
The youngest arrived here Ah-Wow-Wow
And to the world Ah-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow
Even I am mous
Christian the Manau?
Because there is a lot of challenge '
And his crazy women made Ow!
Is that I active it and they put it in Down
We arrived at the disco
Everything is more beautiful handle
A picket of rich
To the security that do not throw me a photo
That I walk with the panas and the night is crazy-trones
A whiskey drink to the rocks
If when we arrive it shows
The fame is so much that if we appear your boyfriend turns crazy

Then we leave here from Puerto Rico to Madrid
Redee to Medellin
About effect? Your money? Doing your solen?
My bank account does not add Multiple Montones

[Chorus]
Don Don Don Dale (EEH)
Santo Domingo a Tigeron Dale (AAH)
Colombia a couple
Puerto Rico a bastard
Vamo 'night per million
Tell me a corduroy ma 'where are the gyalembed
