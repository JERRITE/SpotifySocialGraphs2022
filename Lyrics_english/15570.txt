Just stay in silence Lyrics [letter just stay in silence "]

[Verse 1: Anahí]
I find you awake
You tell me "I'm sorry"
With a tear spill

[Saying: Christian]
You hug me, I ice
You ask me for a kiss
And I stay without breathing
[Pre-Caro: Dulce María]
Just wait a moment
Tell me "is not true"

[Chorus: RBD]
Just stay quiet
Five minutes
Caress me for a moment, come with me
I will give you the last kiss, the deepest
I will keep my feelings
And I'll go away from you

[Post-car: Anahí]
From you, oh

[Verse 2: Christian & Christopher]
I am so scared
And I don't understand
What I have done wrong (I've done wrong)

[Saying: Anahí + Christopher & Christian]
You hug me, I ice (I ice with a kiss)
You ask me for a kiss
And I stay without breathing

[Pre-Caro: Dulce María, Anahí & Christopher and Alfonso]
Just wait a moment (one moment)
Tell me "is not true"

Just stay quiet
Five minutes
Caress me for a moment, come with me
I will give you the last kiss, the deepest
I will keep my feelings
And I'll go away from you

[Bridge: Dulce María and Christian, with Christopher and Anahí]
Give me your hand, return the air to me
Say you love me, you're not guilty
At least one moment
Tell me that this is not true

[Chorus: RBD]
Just stay quiet
Caress me for a moment
I will give you the last kiss
I will keep my feelings and go away from you
Just stay quiet
Five minutes
Caress me for a moment, come with me
I will give you the last kiss, the deepest
I will keep my feelings
And I'll go away from you3embed
