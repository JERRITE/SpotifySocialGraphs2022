BREAKMYHEART Lyrics[Verse]
Time and time again
I’ve tried to mend these wounds, these scars I hide
I’m not ashamed to say I’ve lost my way
Not one single tear in your eyes
You’ve ripped me slowly piece by piece
The other half of me, I can’t replace
So don’t hold back, please break my heart
Alone you left me in the dark
I guess that it was all my fault
Before you go please tell me why
[Chorus]
Why'd you break my heart?
Why'd you break my heart?
Why did you break my heart? (Why?)
Why did you break my heart? (Why?)
Why'd you break my heart? (Why did you break my heart? Why did you break my heart?)You might also likeEmbed
