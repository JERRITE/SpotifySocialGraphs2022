SAD B!TCH Lyrics[Intro]
Aye, Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye, Aye

[Chorus]
Sad bitch but I love being bad
Hopped up out my feelings
And I hopped in my bag
I'm a real hood bitch
I don’t give a fuck
Talk shit, you getting hit
Knuck if you buck
[Verse 1]
Knuck if you buck
Better knuck if you buck
I don't fuck with bitches
But I put it in they gut
I don't fuck with niggas
And I don’t fuck with sluts
But if you wanna talk some money
Then you know I'll pull up

[Refrain]
Aye, I'll pull up
Aye, I'll pull up
Aye, I'll pull up
(Aye)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a sad bitch but I love being bad
Hopped up out my feelings
And I hopped in my bag
I'm a real hood bitch
I don’t give a fuck
Talk shit, you getting hit
Knuck if you buck

[Verse 2]
(Aye) Knuck if you buck
I don’t fuck with bitches
But I put it in they gut
(Aye) Knuck if you buck
I don't fuck with niggas
And I don’t fuck with sluts

I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a sad girl, I’m a bad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl

I'll slap a bitch then I go cry about it (I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl)
I'll stab my nigga then I'll go cry about it (I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl)
I'll kill an op then I'll go laugh about it (I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl)
Then cry about it, then cry about it (I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl)
I'll fuck your nigga while you go cry about it
I'll beat a bitch up make you go cry about it
I'll sleep all night while you go cry 'bout that shit
