Carolina Reaper Lyrics [verse 1]
I started a few years ago, without too many pretensions
Taggedness a few units but hard cock, Calabrian
Productive like Hugo Pratt when he made a short Maltese
Imposing flow, Volgograd, exceeds the statue of freedom, as
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper, Carolina Reaper
Keep closed mouth that is better
That as soon as you open it,
As if you eat a Moruga Scorpion
Burn everything soon as your salary
My pretty and balanced woman
The exact opposite of Nina Moric will
But in contact with my saliva
Sees fire and flames, Naga Morich
He drinks my milk and I wash the burning, I wash the burning (I wash the burning)
The result of combustion as if you cross habanero and raspberry
Filter light from the usual lamppost, champion
Back to your Committenshoppers to remove Parco Sempione
[Refrain]
Stura is underground, watch me goin 'deeper
Escape to Shangri-La, seven years in Tibet
I greet you hello, Sayonara, Priviet
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper

[Verse 2]
My baby has the booty, man, more than sharon stone, ok
But I am not boonkgang. I don't share stories
My cultivar? multiple but what fruits ago
Do you do bad? From six nullity
Turn rumor that in bed does not make trying with turmeric
California Dreamer on a Deville Coup
Porto 2 million and passes by Scoville units (Hey Hey)
Which marijuana, which cocaine
Only mamajuana, zero codeina
My drug friar? Capsaicin
That's why my rap lies at the top
Lengua del Diablo, 7pot
You do you from Kush, I of Habachoc
No Lemon Haze, better lemon drop
If it doesn't go with rap I open a peppers shop
Pigs from lovers not the patrons to Tex-Mex
Dragon's Breath falls asleep, Pepper X makes you out
Red braids in the head but they are not Famous Dex
Try this and jump into the air, semtex

Stura is underground, watch me goin 'deeper
Escape to Shangri-La, seven years in Tibet
I greet you hello, Sayonara, Priviet
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
I close your mouth like a Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
Carolina Reaper
I close your mouth like a Carolina ReaParambed
