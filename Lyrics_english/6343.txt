Stockholm lyrics [lyrics "Stockholm"]

[Intro: Meg Tilly & Shadowfired]
Were you gonna go, What you gonna run, What you gonna hide? Nowher. ... 'Cause There's No One Like You Left (Wow, this is trippy)
I came according to your souls

[Verse 1: Shadowraze & Shadowfired]
I charged Koila Katana, cut the bitch's throat in the bathroom
I take the rank for the rank, this whore is clearly not enough
The arsenal has three raysa and your bitch is all in tears
You get out of the lobber and do not take out in words (how many souls)
The clown is not in the subject, he gobbled up all the coats - he is in anger
Does not finish the revenge, in the lobber he knock on the fuck, F9
Is it worth playing further? You sold your mother in the lobby
I took someone's soul again, you passed me in five (ashm! Ashm!)
Bitch, I'm in Stockholm again, I take the whole pack - I'm satisfied
After heating blood, rays in fucking - it hurts so
The screen will not show me the pulse, I took the entire cache on the epillize
Iâ€™ll die inside, I have so fuck, the list of those who are not in the know (wa-ha ha ha ha-ha ha!)
I am a Tokyo ghoul, I hurt people
I do not give the point of words, I drove your unbearable to zero
I charged Koila Katana, on Finds, click on the tount
I take the pack again, I was Raise - I will stay, vow
[Verse 2: Shinra & Shadowfired]
I threw them a couple of coils
One pika - I'm tired
Zxc on stock, once at a time - my pedestal
One-two-three-password
I am on the left, I call it a Style
Cutting a couple of packs, on highgrade carnival
With me is a bag, everything is so stupid
In the Bracer bag - very wise
Lost in the farm of creeps (ha ha ha ha ha!)
Second band, people, very stupid
My Jitsu, my races
Hidden sheet is my house
My bands, my branches (Shadowfired)
I'm on the suite - there is my throne
Icewrack, Iceeshard, Teleport and Start
Two circus, slippers, branches
No more back
I cut this glass - call this varnish
I am on a skill, the shower of thirty, your souls are marriage (ha ha ha ha ha!) You might also like9embed
