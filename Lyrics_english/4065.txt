TranslationEnglishla Playa Lyrics [Lyrics for "The Beach"]

[Intro]
Full Harmony

[Chorus]
I did it to you on the beach, right in front of the shore
She and I do not know 'anything, but only in quotes'
She and 'my baby, below' the water or if not above the sand
You ere 'my siren
Because I did it to you on the beach, right in front of the shore
She and I do not know 'anything, but only in quotes'
She and 'my baby, below' the water or if not above the sand
You ere 'my siren
[Bridge]
Use bikini
I put the 'legs like the door' of a Lamborghini
I give him without beanie
And I love you for me, baby, Believe me
I want you to be 'Queen, I don't talk about Ivy (no)
Use bikini
I put the 'legs like the door' of a Lamborghini (ey)
I give him without beanie-ie
And I love you for me, Baby, Believe Me (Ey)
I want you to be 'Queen, I don't talk about Ivy (EY)

[Chorus]
I did it to you on the beach, right in front of the shore
And she and I do not know 'nothing, but only in a quote'
She and 'my baby, below' the water or if not above the sand
You ere 'my siren, ah

[Verse 1]
I put his leg 'like the door' of a lamb
And when I am giving him, always accelerating
Skrrt, Skrrt, the boyfriend moved pa 'Orlando
I have her kneeling and not e 'for you that she is praying
He likes janguita in the 'boats
He likes smoking and putting drops for the note not to notice
Send the friend to 'buy
She always is in neckline '
'Tá good from below to the top
I pay you to touch it, because

I did it to her on the beach, right in front of the shore
She and I do not know 'anything, but only in quotes'
She and 'my baby, below' the water or if not above the sand
You ere 'my siren

[Verse 2]
I put it below 'the water
I did it in his room and then in the bus
I don't 'do' sing in a motel in Caguas
I said: "I just arrive and I take care"
And now I spend looking for you for the Rede ', always sailing
And I did it for Loíza, in Ocean Park Echamo 'part
It was 'my favorite hobby and today you can' look for you
It was in Cabo Rojo, I think it was in Culebra
That I saw her and I did it mine, in Boquerón and in the Parguera
Giving table in the cabin 'e wood (ah)
Mirror 'Cartier in the same way (hehe)
She with her pamela (ah)
She wrapped herself and gave her candle (hehe)
She didn't care that people see us (ah)
There was no tsunami or earthquake that they did not move

[Chorus]
I did it to her on the beach, just at the head of the shore
She and I do not know 'anything, but only in quotes'
She and 'my baby, below' the water or if not above the sand
You ere 'my siren, ah
[Outro]
Easy Money, Baby, hehe
You ere 'my baby and you know it' (ey-ey-ey)
