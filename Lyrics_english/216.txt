Alligator Walk Lyrics[Intro]
(No, Shawn, you passed the limit)
Cuttin' up, cuttin' up (This Lil Top)
Cuttin' up, cuttin' up
Bitch, I'm cuttin' up, like, yeah
Cuttin' up, cuttin' up
Boaw, baow, take off his face, huh
(Cuttin' up, cuttin' up)

[Chorus]
I'ma get 'em stepped on (Huh)
Hold 'em dead bodies for my nigga
They been stepped on (Stepped on)
Do 'em dirty, do 'em bad (They know that)
I'm gon' get you repped on (Ayy)
Got a shirt tied 'round his head just for a mask
And got the window down (Ski)
Keep yo' heat, be cool, I'ma get all 'em gone
[Verse 1]
I stopped the whip, hopped in the street
Right inside my pants, where I tote the heat
Dead bodies left right where I be
Green flag, nigga, know it ain't no peace (No)
Meechy still sellin' dope from Beaumont way back in Missouri Street
Top tryna split a nigga from P Street way back to South 13
Bitch my money up and I'm bootin' up in a Lexus like its '99
Bitch I'm chewed up and I'm tooled up and I'm flexin'
You is not my kind
Rich just got that Maybach truck
Jump in that bitch, light up time
My empire, I been holdin' up
But now they need to free them slimes
They the ones who go to spit my rhyme
Only ones who down deserve my time
Get loaded while I think 'bout youngin
Need to win one million a million times
50 AR hold sixty, got it wit' me in the city slidin'
PTR, I'm plastic grippin', hit it, takin' off your mind

[Chorus]
I'ma get 'em stepped on (Huh)
Hold 'em dead bodies for my nigga
They been stepped on (Stepped on)
Do 'em dirty, do 'em bad (They know that)
I'm gon' get you repped on (Ayy)
Got a shirt tied 'round his head just for a mask
And got the window down (Ski)
Keep yo heat, be cool, I'ma get all 'em gone

This that fuck a hater talk, bitch
Really from the bayou
This that alligator walk, bitch
Real assassination shit
He gon' put a wig on while he slang that stick
Real food distributor, still drive Navigators around this bitch
Thank this Rollie I got blessed wit' way from '96
Yeah, drop, I'm gon' drop one
Talkin' 'bout Lil Top, you know AI, I keep a hot gun
Loaded, I been rollin', plus I'm mugged up 'cause it's not fun
Been in this bitch and doin' my shit since they was sayin' he too young
This bitch act like he wanna do somethin'
Youngest flexin', whoop 'em, zip 'em, drag 'em out
Stolo' whippin', pistol grippin', tryna bag 'em down
He left two stretched out without no witness 'round (Yeah, yeah)
Still had a army in that north when I ain't have millions 'round
(Nigga, yeah, yeah)

[Interlude: Rich The Kid & NBA Youngboy]
What, you finna go cop that Maybach truck?
No, man, I been— I'm sitting around playin' it off and shit
Ayy, what you looking crazy for, man?
Ayy, you know I’m on drank right now, son
Oh, I ain't need that though and I got yo' shit to flow in
And I got yo' shit to flex and fuck these hoes in (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
I'ma get 'em stepped on (Huh)
Hold 'em dead bodies for my nigga
They been stepped on (Stepped on)
Do 'em dirty, do 'em bad (They know that)
I'm gon' get you repped on (Ayy)
Got a shirt tied 'round his head just for a mask
And got the window down (Ski)
Keep yo heat, be cool, I'ma get all 'em gone3Embed
