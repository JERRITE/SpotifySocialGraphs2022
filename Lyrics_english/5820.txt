Meet Virginia Lyrics[Verse 1]
She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Smokes a pack a day, no wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful

[Bridge 1]
Meet Virginia
[Verse 3]
She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful

[Bridge 1]
Meet Virginia

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene

[Chorus 1]
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be the Queen"

[Verse 4]
When Daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
And brother is a fine mediator
For the President

[Verse 5]
And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
You might also like[Bridge 1]
Meet Virginia, mmmm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life

[Chorus 1]
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna live this life"

[Post-Chorus]
No mama
No mama
No mama
No mama

[Verse 6]
She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite
Unusual

[Verse 7]
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body?
Unusual
[Bridge 2]
Well, meet Virginia
I can't wait to
Meet Virginia
Yeah yeah hey hey hey

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well she wants to be the queen
And she thinks about her scene

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life

[Chorus 1]
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be the queen"

[Outro]
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna live this6Embed
