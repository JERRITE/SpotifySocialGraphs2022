Danteâ€™s Creek Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
If it happened now, would you take it how you left it?
It's a give and take, so take your time, take me under
I wanna know, could you show me what I'm missing?

[Verse]
In the playground in Southern California
Something running in the streets all day
I guess some of us just gotta learn the hard way
Who give a damn what nobody gotta say
You need to sell it now
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
If it happened now, would you take it how you left it?
It's a give and take, so take your time, take me under
I wanna know, could you show me what I'm missing?

[Bridge]
This can't be for nothing
We live for something
But nowhere we going
At least till the morning
This can't be for nothing
We live for something
But nowhere we going
At least till the morning

[Verse]
In the playground in Southern California
Something running in the streets all day
I guess some of us just gotta learn the hard way
Who give a damn what nobody gotta say
You need to sell it now
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
If it happened now, would you take it how you left it?
It's a give and take, so take your time, take me under
I wanna know, could you show me what I'm missing?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh

[Outro]
(This can't be for nothing)
Oh-oh
(We live for something)
Ooh, oh-oh
(But nowhere we going)
Oh-oh
(At least till the morning)13Embed
