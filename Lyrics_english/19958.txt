I Donâ€™t Feel Anything Lyrics[Intro]
I'm so high
Nothing can hurt me
No, I don't feel anything

[Chorus]
So much money in my pocket that my wallet won't close
I got ice around my neck, and it feels like it's froze
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm not the one you chose
Now I'm lyin' all alone, now I'm dyin' all alone
Now I'm cryin' on the phone, but that phone's iPhone 7
Know I'll probably go to hell, but 'least my dogs'll go to heaven
Now I'm fuckin' up a check, but I don't feel anything
No, I don't feel anything
I been smokin' on that loud, baby
I'm tryna make my mama proud, baby
My bro, he got it by the pound, baby
Might throw that money on the ground, baby
[Verse]
You see me gettin' emotional, syrup what I'm sippin'
I be wet just like the ocean, look like I was swimmin'
And my bitch she bad as fuck, they tryna take a picture
Why you tryna to be like us? You know we can't fuck with ya
Get the check, fuck it up like my life be
I don't give a fuck if anyone like me
I just blew a bill up my sinus
Just blew a bag to put some color on my eyelids
Wipe my tears with the same dang Louis scarf
Feelin' low like how the chain hang in my heart
Bein' alive's just a phase we're all goin' through
But, I'd like to go through it, with you

[Chorus]
So much money in my pocket that my wallet won't close
I got ice around my neck and it feels like it's froze
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm not the one you chose
Now I'm lyin' all alone, now I'm dyin' all alone
Now I'm cryin' on the phone, but that phone's iPhone 7
Know I'll probably go to hell, but 'least my dogs'll go to heaven
Now I'm fuckin' up a check, but I don't feel anything
No, I don't feel anything
I been smokin' on that loud, baby
I'm tryna make my mama proud, babyYou might also like3Embed
