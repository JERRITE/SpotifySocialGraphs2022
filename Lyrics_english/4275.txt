Dancing provocas lyrics (hey, hey ...)
What what!
("Mas Flow"!)
Looney Tunes and Trebol Clan!
(Woah ...)
(Hey, Hey ...)

You dancing provokes
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me
You dancing provokes
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me
You are a beast, you make me look bad
You are the only person that I'm going to blame
For you to know, you don't miss a lot
Nor are you the reason for my temptation
I see you dancing and I can imagine
Like tonight I want to finish it
Body with body to feel heat
Body with body, that's much better

You dancing provokes
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me
You dancing provokes
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me

Give it, keep moving like this
Above pa 'below
Move and not even
That what I say is not relax
It is true what they tell you
I have a unique trick
If you are interested, see it to find out with me
Dancing, sweating
Drunk, crazy and wrapped
Loose, slow
This is how i feel
Dancing, sweating
Drunk, crazy and wrapped
Loose, slow
This is how i feel
You might also like dancing provoces
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me
You dancing provokes
Put me wrong
Stay here
Dancing with me
You...
