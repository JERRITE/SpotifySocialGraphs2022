Proud Mary Lyrics[Intro, spoken: Tina]
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
[Verse 1: Ike]
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

[Chorus: Ike & Tina, Tina, Ike]
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story now

[Verse 1: Ike & Tina]
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

[Chorus: Ike & Tina, Tina, Ike]
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

[Chorus: Ike & Tina, Tina, Ike]
Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)

Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

And you don't have to worry if you got no money
