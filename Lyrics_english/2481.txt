[Chorus]
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap (Fantom)
She make it (Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap (She make it)
[Verse]
Ooh, uh, she make it clap
Riding 'round town with the strap in my lap
Ooh, yeah, she make it clap
I'm trying to grab it then hit from the back
Told her, "Drop it down", 'cause I like that
After I hit then I'll bе right back
I walk in the club and whip out the racks
I'm blowin' on gas, she doin' hеr dance
She makin' it clap, I might have the heart attack
I walk in the club and I'm makin' it rain with them stacks
She drop it to the ground, she know that it fat
I run through that sack when I thumb through them racks
I whip up that dough, boy, I'm fresh out the trap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
I hit from the back
Walk in the club and I thumb through them racks (Ugh)

[Chorus]
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it (Ugh)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it (Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it clap, clap, clap
She make it (Uh)You might also like12Embed
