To Love Someone Else Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know you make me feel good
And that’s something I don’t take for granted lately, no
Those eyes, that smile, yeah it glows
But I can’t help feeling like something’s missing though

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re perfectly good
Probably better
But please don’t waste your pretty time on me
[Chorus]
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
And I could get attached and love the hell out of you
I could fall for you if I let myself
But I don’t think I’m ready to love someone else
And I hate him for not letting me feel like I can finally breathe
I hate it
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
But I can’t

[Verse 2]
I know this isn’t easy
That’s all that people tell me
When you come out of a love as the one who’s not enough
It feels like there’s no healing

[Pre-Chorus]
And you’re perfectly good
Probably better
But please don’t waste your pretty time on me

[Chorus]
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
And I could get attached and love the hell out of you
I could fall for you if I let myself
But I don’t think I’m ready to love someone else
And I hate him for not letting me feel like I can finally breathe
I hate it
And I know you’re probably best for me
I see the way you look at me and I hate it
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
But I can’t
You might also like[Bridge]
You know that I would
You’re so much better
But that’s not enough
If I can’t get over
The way he used to look at me
And how he left so easily

[Chorus]
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
And I could get attached and love the hell out of you
I could fall for you if I let myself
But I don’t think I’m ready to love someone else
And I hate him for not letting me feel like I can finally breathe
I hate it
And I know you’re probably best for me
I see the way you look at me and I hate it
‘Cause I could fall for you if I wanted to
But I can’t2Embed
