No Other Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it true?
You’ve been feeling sort of low these days
Just don’t have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

[Pre-Chorus]
If it’s so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?
[Chorus]
Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Verse 2]
Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out?
It’s simply just my stubborn heart, no doubt, rambling away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If it’s not
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

[Chorus]
Well, for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
For one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Outro]
Ohhh
