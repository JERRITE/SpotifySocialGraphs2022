Always fine lines between us
They say nowadays don't mean much
Cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
But my ship set sail and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for, yeah
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Should I wait, should I stay to see it
Unfold 'cause I’m told, I need it
I’m not frightened to take a step away
But my ship set sail and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for, yeah
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)

[Bridge]
I’ve been running round, running round, running round
Now I’m down and out, down and out, down and out
Scared the magic might fade away

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
