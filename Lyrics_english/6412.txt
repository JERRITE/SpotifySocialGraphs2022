TranslationsPortuguêsAbsinthe Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bring to me your sons and daughters
‘Cause absinthe makes the heart grow fonder

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't care what momma says
You’ll wind me up or you'll wind up dead
I don't care what momma says

[Chorus]
I don’t believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Whatever they give you, stop drinking it down
[Verse 2]
If I were you, then I'd stop talking
'Cause soon you'll be a dead man walking

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't care what momma says
You'll wind me up or you'll wind up dead
I don’t care what momma says

[Chorus]
I don’t believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Whatever they give you, stop drinking it down

[Bridge]
I hear voices, I see visions
These spirits are your prison
I hear voices I see visions
These spirits are your prison

[Chorus]
I don’t believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I won't believe whatever this is
Until you burn all of the witches
I don't believe whatever this isYou might also like22Embed
