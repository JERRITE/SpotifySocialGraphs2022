That dancing 'well drunk'
We kissed ’well drunk’ both

Just when he believed
That for eating do ’or ten, I would forget you '(Yeh)
I took a breath and got out of the road
And like a asshole, I didn't know what he was doing
I never overcame it, I never overcome you (no; no)

Ere 'Kanye West's dark fantasy, baby, ey

And I haven't come to my head for a long time
But they are already a couple of beer '
And I remembered how you kisses me '
Of to 'lo' dust 'on top' and the table
And in the car, the beach, and the motel
At your Pai's house, when I was going to see you
I see them that you 'do not' come to take
You jumping Mojaíta ', sweating Chanel
I know that ours yesterday
And it makes me happy that you do well with him
I neither missed you nor wanted to see you
But they put the song you liked to put
And I remembered you, when you made me happy
It ended, then, I left, he
I laugh myself because—

[Chorus: j Balvin]
I thought I had 'forget you, huh
But they put the song, Yeh, Yeh
That we sing well drunk
What dance 'well drunk
We kissed 'well drunk' lo 'do'

[Outro: Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
And I thought your name was dead, huh
But I dreamed you awake, hey
Today I left the loose street
Without feeling ', the desert heart
And I thought your name was dead
But I dreamed you awake
Today I came out for the street loose feeling ', the heart desert11Embed
