Ferrari Horses Lyrics[Intro: Young Adz, RAYE]
This is so fun
(On the way, mhm-hm)
Hello? Yo
(Beatfreakz)
Yeah, that's it, that's it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Adz]
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh
Rap nigga still sellin' bricks, half a cake on the way, uh-huh
Take a flight, she wanna take a Lyft, for the molly man, he's on the way, uh-huh
I might take her The Shard, I might take her The Ritz, it don't matter, baby, I'm straight, uh-huh
Heart broke when them pills done, Prometh', I can't feel now
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh
[Verse 1: RAYE, Young Adz]
I feel like I'm in Prince's housе, purple paint all on the walls, uh-huh
Sittin' down on this fancy couch and I can't see straight, I'm a state, uh-huh
22, I'm in Paris, baby, got a strippеrs tits in my face, uh-huh
Pull up in a Bentley, I want Christian, I want Fendi, I want Prada (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge: Young Adz & RAYE]
Ferrari horses, hee
Cocaine scope, let's ski (Yeah)
All of this ice, we freeze
And my new hoe on page 3
I already make that paper, I don't need to chase no clout, wow
I don't usually pipe up but I don't like how you runnin' your mouth, wow
You're a side piece from east, then I'm a bad bitch from south, wow
Baby, baby I got more money coming in than going out

[Chorus: Young Adz with RAYE]
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh
Rap nigga still sellin' bricks, half a cake on the way, uh-huh
Take a flight, she wanna take a Lyft, for the molly man, he's on the way, uh-huh
I might take her The Shard, I might take her The Ritz, it don't matter, baby, I'm straight, uh-huh
Heart broke when them pills done, Prometh', I can't feel now
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Ooooh, why you calling my phone at 6 in the morning?
Said he need me right now and he said it's important
It's not a lot of girls you can open up to
Let's spend some money, some designer, fuck the feels
I ain't even been myself for a while, you can see it in my eyes
I'm so lit, I can see two Young Adz, LB, big vibe went way too high

Birkin bag for my favourite girl
We fuck so rough, she gon' break her nails
That's a fast car, that's an Audemar
We fuck tonight in the same Chanel
I'm the highest here, can I save myself?
We go Harrods tonight and buy YSL
I got nothin' to lose, I got nothin' to prove 'cause girl, there's no other one
I'm sippin' on medicine, ain't got no flu, I'm high off prescription drugs
I'm high off the drink, help me to think, pour me another one

[Chorus: Young Adz]
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh
Rap nigga still sellin' bricks, half a cake on the way, uh-huh
Take a flight, she wanna take a Lyft, for the molly man, he's on the way, uh-huh
I might take her The Shard, I might take her The Ritz, it don't matter, baby, I'm straight, uh-huh
Heart broke when them pills done, Prometh', I can't feel now
'Bout to take my lady Selfridges, new drip on the way, uh-huh

[Outro: Young Adz, RAYE]
