Don't say I'm abnormal for wanting sex on the beach, on the beach
Come, give just one proba ', but ma', if you like you don't go
Don't say I'm abnormal for wanting sex on the beach, on the beach
Come, give just one proba ', but ma', if you like you don't go

[Verse 1]
Without fear, ma ', from the routine scand up
Today we go beach, pack the towel
I walk, mommy, even with a booth. '
Ready pa 'pass me the line
Pa 'play volleyball without mesh
Is that in your thong you look scalp
'So vamo' to see when the sun goes
Give it, vo 'to turn on the bonfire
Throw the firewood and kill us the whole night

Don't say I'm abnormal for wanting sex on the beach, on the beach
Come, give just one proba ', but ma', if you like you don't go
Don't say I'm abnormal for wanting sex on the beach, on the beach
Come, give just one proba ', but ma', if you like you don't go

[Verse 2]
I just want to dawn with you
And see how my skin and skin change color
When the sun heats
Naked, stirring in the sand, feeling the heat
When the sun heats
Enjoying the moment
Quiet, come with me, if there is no party, I invented it
Without eating story, I don't lie
Without losing time
Mommy, take advantage of the moment
Without losing time
