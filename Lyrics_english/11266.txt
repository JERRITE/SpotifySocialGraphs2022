Running Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if everything we see is a bad dream
That everything around us is an illusion
What if the leaders in the cloud have a big plan
For the people in the world who are unaware

[Verse 2]
We see the fire in the sky it's for real now
A never ending flame of forever
We hide our fears and prepare evacuation
To save our lives and get away from the extinction
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stars are falling from the sky
Time is ticking and we see the world collide

[Chorus]
We are running like the wind, through the night
And the storms still raging out there
For the ones who gave their lives for the fight
We'll keep on running

[Verse 3]
We live our life in the state of confusion
Disconnected from the world as we know it
The desire for a life of perfection
Always fighting for the dream against deception

[Verse 4]
(We try our best to reach out but it's useless)
(Another victim of a crime in the system)
(We cannot stay in this place, here forever)
(We need to run like the wind and be clever)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The flames are burning solid ground
Time is ticking as we enter battleground
You might also like[Chorus]
We are running like the wind, through the night (like the wind)
And the storms still raging out there (out there)
For the ones who gave their lives for the fight
We'll keep on running

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We are running like the wind, through the night
And the storms still raging out there
For the ones who gave their lives for the fight
We'll keep on running
Running tonight

We are running like the wind, through the night (through the night)
And the storms still raging out there (out there)
For the ones who gave their lives for the fight
We'll keep on runningEmbed
