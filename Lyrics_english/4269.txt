MET COVER LYRICS [LETTER OF "METELE SALE"]

[Intro]
Hey, Borincana Sandunga
Pa 'my courts
And for the Dominican Republic
With Luny Tunes and Noriega
More flow
More flow
And I thought they knew about you
Luny, I fell on fire
Pa 'to'a those shorty's in the New Yores
[Chorus]
Hey, get it seasoning
Battery and reggaeton
That the rest is put by Calderón

[Bridge]
The flavor, the most beautiful
The one who has nerve guasons
What You Talking?
More beautiful than in Lucky
This horse does not run with jockey
Báilalo, baby, this is a good thing
But don't talk to me with your mouth full
Abnormal, the generals arrived
No matter how much you treat you
What I bring is the Saranana
The Cambumbo does not tied, wins
To hesitate my courts
With Luny Tunes, with others, Mama
Pa 'to'as the Shorty's in the New Yores
Pa 'thugs in prisons

[Chorus]
Hey, get it seasoning
Battery and reggaeton
That the rest is put by Calderón
Say, get it seasoning
Battery and reggaeton
That the rest is put by Calderón

Mommy, you know that I am the most Caracachimba
The ugly of beautiful girls
Hey, get it seasoning
Battery and reggaeton
That the rest is put by Calderón
That pigwon wants to make
With the hiju 'e whore in the microphone
'Tate still, who now came to Pan Pilla'o
Do not sleep from that la'o, mama'o
In Sandungueo himself I am delivered
What knows that I am the one who distributes
The cod I like AFEITA'O
Without thorns, and for times I have drown
Have careful, this black is approved
Since I left I have not stopped
They have been
And even with Hamburgers they have thrown him
They walk guilla'o, but they have not made a manda'o
Playing brave and there are two shit
Sandunguia'o, good abayardia'o
From Puerto Rico Pa 'to' the La'os

[Chorus]
Put it seasoning
Battery and reggaeton
