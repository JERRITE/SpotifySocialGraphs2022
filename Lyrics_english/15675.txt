And you leave Lyrics [lyrics "and you leave"]

[Verse 1]
I never imagined life without you
In everything I raised, you were always
Only you know well who I am
Where do I come from and where I go
I have never lied to you, I have never hid anything
You always had me when you needed me
No one better than you will know
That I gave everything I could give
[Chorus]
Oh ... and now you leave, as if nothing (and you leave)
Shortening my life, crouching my eyes
And you leave, and I ... that I get lost in nothing (and you go)
Where are the words and love that you sworn me?
And you leave, oh ...

[Verse 2]
If I have failed you, tell me how and when it has been
If you have tired and now you forget me
There will be no one who will love you
Just as I can love you

[Chorus]
Oh ... and now you leave, as if nothing (and you leave)
Shortening my life, crouching my eyes
And you leave, and I ... that I get lost in nothing (and you go)
Where are the words and love that you sworn me?
And you go away...

[Verse 3]
No matter how much I am looking for, I can't find reason
As much as I try, I can't forget
You are like a flame
That burns at the bottom of my heart

(And you leave) and you leave
(And you go) shortening my life, crouching my eyes
And you leave, and you leave (and you leave)
Shortening my life, crouching my eyes
(And you go) 1embed
