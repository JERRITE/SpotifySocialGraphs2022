Tell him Lyrics [letter of "Tell him"]

[Chorus]
Tell him
What in bed you and I did
And talk about the pain when we said goodbye
And tell him
What in bed you and I did
And talk about the pain when we said goodbye

[Verse]
Since you're not everything hurts, baby
The others do not fill me
To forget you there is no way
Since you are not the neighbor below it has leaks
Of so many tears
Baby, does not end our chapter no matter how much I pass from page
Fame does not fill even half
Of what you did ', empty souls'
Separated by what united them one day
Time made you so distant and so cold
You are the Russian roulette of a lost bullet
I know that with another you are happy, baby
But don't love him like me, baby
As much as I spend looking for a new
Tell me who is the only one who takes you to heaven
I do it with another, I imagine your face
When I realize my mind is locked
Memories of when in my bed you were
I don't feel anything anymore, mai '
If time does not kill me, then the karma will do it
For just being happy when lifting your skirt
I complain about how much weight being my own load
It's bad to think so much to the many '
But I found the rose that I was looking for in your spine
He says that I look like a son of ruin
And I so low in love
And she lacks self -esteem
I prefer to be dead than live
If it's not with you
[Chorus]
Tell him
What in bed you and I did
And talk about the pain when we said goodbye
And tell him
What in bed you and I did
And talk about the pain of when we said goodbye to might also likembed
