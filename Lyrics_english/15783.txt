Don't ask who Lyricsya I don't know if you got to sleep
Much less that you want me
I got tired of waiting for the miracle
To be like before

And it is necessary that I tell you
Your absences have made me a wound
I forgot our last time
And I looked for an exit

If it amazes you that I was capable
I learned it well from you
Don't ask who
I unleash my desire
I sigh for sigh
You have no right to ask me for
You did not have the value
To be only mine

Don't ask who
I dared to be the one that was not with you
He makes me reach where you could not
Do not do badly third
He stays with me

Your suitcases await you outside
And don't forget to close the door well
Be Cort√©s and walk from the front
If you find it

If it amazes you that I was capable
I have learned it from you

Don't ask who
I unleash my desire
I sigh for sigh
You have no right to ask me for
You did not have the value
To be only mine
You might also like you ask who
I unleash my desire
I sigh for sigh
You have no right to ask me for
You did not have the value
To be only mine

Don't ask who
I unleash my desire
I sigh for sigh
You have no right to ask me for
You did not have the value
To be only mine

Don't ask who
I dared to be the one that was not with you
He makes me reach where you could not
Do not do badly third
He stays with me

If it amazes you that I was capable
I have learned it from trembed
