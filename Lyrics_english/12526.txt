Walking On Water Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna tell you how over and over
Real love feels like walkin' on water
I wanna tell you we'll be here forever
Real love feels like walkin' on water

[Post-Chorus]
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never еnd, it's you
Right beside me
[Bridge]
You always will rеmember
Ooh (You'll never forget)
You never will forget her
Ooh

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you how over and over
Real love feels like walkin' on water
I wanna tell you we'll be here forever
Real love feels like walkin' on water

[Post-Chorus]
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside me
Some things never end, it's you
Right beside meYou might also likeEmbed
