Teach me to lie Lyricsme disgusting to think that I kissed you when
She came to visit you, I found out the woman of the
That I fell in love with which everything leaves
I cheated on me
Teach me to lie to be bad
Feel shame like you
Teach me to pretend you have the ability to
Get to suffer
It is worth crying even though
It hurts the same I'm going to leave you because a
Love like this does not suit me
It is worth crying even though it hurts
I am going to let you not listen to you
To my heart I will do what I
It is convenient
And now I understand and put myself
To tie the ends and I am understanding
What you are saying you keep lying to me
In life it is better take it as a
Tipooo
And now I understand why for me you
You never had time you were
Hiding may not be so
To give yourself to him took a long time
I find out what they really taught you
In your six -year class I find out
Practical anatomy and studied was
