Jeremiah 17: 5 Lyrics [letter of "Jeremiah 17: 5"]

[Intro]
Hey, with the truth you get far away
Over, get my voice there, a tad
Ey, in no

[Pre-verso]
"Take care of envy, millet"
Looking into my eyes, my old woman, rest in peace now, once told me
And what reason was I warned of this Puerca life
Do not raise crows, or your eyes will tear off your basins
[Verse 1]
I have realized that the truth is so relative
And the reality is so much lie ...
Dogs trying to invade my private property. While I slept
Seeking to steal my females, my reais, my food
"Damn is the man who trusts another man"
What a great truth in that phrase is hidden
I feel like crazy when trying to trust
In someone, on the planet of hypocrisy
Murse me, I'm an illusory! So brave that I give it to me and the abuse
It is natural that against me give use
Dirty world where everyone thinks only of themselves
Damn thousand times, puppets of selfishness
This is pa 'ti, pa' ti, you who betrayed me
You shake hands, with your face 'e "I was not"
And I gave it to you because I still didn't know
That your giggle came with the date already won '
This song is not for anyone
I don't feel like killing someone for false and pussy 'e her mother
Another hand with dagger in my number
The hand of such a carnal, brother that my hand used to narrow
The most traitor may have it head -on
Drinking your cold, or sharing your hot dinner
I wish those who always lie
And once in hell, who burn forever
Have you never thought that your partner can be a dirty
What can Chuzo give you for a business?
My arm tells me that love will take me away
But hatred taught me to be a lynx, never a asshole
With the fingers were counted
Those that that same hand for them put to the fire
Now for a zamuro in lamb suit, tired
He is thinking of having to fly a deo '
That's why I don't believe in my pillow
Not in my shadow, that is nothing
I don't even believe in my old man!
If one day I tell you that I believe you, do not believe me that I believe you
Because, I don't believe in my reflection
If you are looking for a friendly hand starts through your arm
That I knew at the end of the pain
I hope my life is long to see when yours fails
And step on your hand when you ask me to hike you, my pace

I am simply inexpressive, when I write
I hardly drink rum, but came and from heart I say
That the dirty revenge kills the soul and poisons it
But when it comes to betrayal it is worth it
The word is valid, the trap comes out
Varconitos are seen in the eyes to tell truths
Leave it colla 'when you lose battle, that this is not the war
And if any fails, change it by bitch
Shit the blood, stone the heart
Get on volume, repeat me prayer
"Damn is the man who trusts another man"
Those who betrayed, remember their faces and their names
There is only one thing in you that I admire
And, how are being so two faces still sleeping?
For my part, well, I smile
But for my mother, it is not good to have the enemy's tiredness
The neighborhood did not happen in vain
Like Willie Colón in the deep of my heart I'm bad
These damn cagapalos think that I am not clear
That they are not a pussy 'e mothers my brothers
I am life and death, and I don't believe in anything
Neither in living legends, nor in dead legends, nor resurrected
I am real like Bolívar and his sword
Giving stab to the hypocrites by their facades
He knows me to shit, culture, whores and fame
This song is not to stick, it already has a truth attached
You will live trauma when you don't have panas
And you notice that those who tell you that they love you look at me with desire
I know the flow and skills
I am rough, I do not get rhymes that are not real
God wants not to find González outside
And invites you a court until either of them dies
A pussy and 'mother, gentleman, right?
If I can, it stabs you even with the pencil that I used pa'l theme
Fakes, there are more than flies where you shit
Or bad smell where you were, without metaphors? Quite
One hand cuts you the other, as Tempo said
And the shares are not taken by the wind
That Christ forgives you if it exists
Because if for me, I can sing this while I meo in your sad grave
That the hand raises the one who does not believe in anyone
And if nobody goes up, I upload it
I hope you die, old compadre
And let's see ourselves in hell to kill me again
[Bridge]
God cannot double what I think when I observe you
Because more than once I can't enter hell
And don't tell me "your brother" that pa 'ti I'm tired
Rolitronco 'e mamagüevo

[Pre-verso]
"Take care of envy, millet"
Looking into my eyes, my old woman, rest in peace now, once told me
And what reason was I warned of this Puerca life
Do not raise crows, or your eyes will tear off your basins

[Outro]
Stop crying, damn whore
That I have not thrown tears18embed
