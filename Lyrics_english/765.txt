He no longer has boyfriend Lyrics [lyrics by "He no longer has a boyfriend" ft. Mau & Ricky]

[Intro]
Yatra, Yatra
Okay, yes, yes
Mau and Ricky

[Choir: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend (and now it's alone)
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend (and now he is mine alone)
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend (and now it's mine alone)
[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]
The last time I saw her
She was with a guy out there
What a strange thing, now it is on top of me
What's happening? What's happening?
I don't know, I know
But it seems that she wants to take revenge on him, he

[Pre-Caro: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]
If your boyfriend ends you, I have the best medicine
If your boyfriend ends you, mixture guaro with tequila (ay)

[Choir: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend (because he no longer has a boyfriend)
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend (and now it's mine alone)
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend (because he no longer has a boyfriend)
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend (and now it's mine alone)

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Oh, ay, ay, ay (Yeah)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
That I have what the boyfriend did not have

Only in two minutes it rides on me
She wants me to do it tonight
That grip it and take it for the corner
And I know that I have what Yatra didn't have
He stuck, stuck, nobody took it to me
He stuck, stuck, I think he fell in love
He stuck, hit, never took off
He stuck, stuck

[Pre-Caro: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
If your boyfriend (if your boyfriend) ends (ends you)
I have the best medicine
If your boyfriend (if your boyfriend) ends (ends you)
Guaro mixture with tequila

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend (and now he is mine alone)
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
That I have what the boyfriend did not have
[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]
With his murderous voice he tells me
"Yatra, come on, my house is empty"
This is not over
We started in the room and finished 'in the pool

[Pre-Caro: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
If your boyfriend (if your boyfriend), ends you (ends you)
I have the best medicine
If your boyfriend (if your boyfriend) ends (ends you)
Guaro mixture with tequila

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
They don't see her for a while, but today she went to drink
Because he no longer has a boyfriend
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I give her
Because I don't have a girlfriend (and now it's mine alone)

[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]
Oh, ay, ay, ay (Yeah)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
That I have what the boyfriend did not have

[Outro]
Mau and Ricky
Yatra, Yatra
I tell Mau and Ricky that ... (hahaha)
She doesn't want them
Says I have what Yatra didn't have
Sky, breaking the bass
