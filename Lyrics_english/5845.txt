Rhythm of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
I told her, "I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
[Verse 2]
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum
You might also likeBop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

[Verse 3]
And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Oh, play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love11Embed
