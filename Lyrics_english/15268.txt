My Own Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you feel it?
Essence weak in this room
Designing all the paintings on the wall
And it's the right
That sets me in despair
It's ornamental
When I beg for you

[Chorus]
So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over
So I'll start!
[Verse 2]
It doesn't show
And we're not well behaved
It's always there when you're not expecting it
So you complain
Your legs are tired
Sit in my chair
Don't fall through it

[Chorus]
So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over
So I'll start!

[Outro]
(I'm never going to get my own life, no
I'm never going to get my own
I'm never going to get my own
I'm never going to get my own)
I'm never going to get my own life, no
I'm never going to get my own life, no
I'm never going to get my own life, no
I'm never going to get my own life, noYou might also likeEmbed
