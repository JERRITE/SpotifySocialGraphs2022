Nothingâ€™s Gonna Stop Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, look out world cause here I come
I'm burnin' brighter than the sun
You put up walls but I can break 'em, break 'em
Fear is not a roadblock in my way
Don't care what the haters say
They don't scare me, I'm not shaken, shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if ya think I'm gonna quit
Go and cross it off your list!
[Chorus]
I just wanna scream out loud
Nothing's gonna stop me now!
I'm never comin' off this cloud
So move over, move over, move over
You don't wanna mess with me
I know who I'm meant to be
Never gonna slow me down
Nothin's gonna stop me, nothin's gonna stop me
Now-ow-owww-ow-ow-owww-ow
Nothin's gonna stop me
Now-ow-owww-ow-ow-owww-ow
Nothing's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
I'm movin' faster than you think
You might miss me if you blink
Every day I'm gettin' stronger, stronger

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I was born to break the rules
So that's just what I'm gonna do!

[Chorus]
I just wanna scream out loud
Nothing's gonna stop me now!
I'm never comin' off this cloud
So move over, move over, move over
You don't wanna mess with me
I know who I'm meant to be
Never gonna slow me down
Nothin's gonna stop me, nothin's gonna stop me
Now-ow-owww-ow-ow-owww-ow
Nothin's gonna stop me
Now-ow-owww-ow-ow-owww-ow
Nothing's gonna stop me now

[Chorus]

Nothing's gonna stop me now!
