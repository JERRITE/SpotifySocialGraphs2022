Into the Sea (It’s Gonna Be Ok) [Acoustic] Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heart is breaking
In a way I never thought it could
My mind is racing
With the question, "Are You still good?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Can You make something from the wreckage?
Would You take this heart and make it whole again?

[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay"
[Verse 2]
I've blamed myself
And if I'm honest, maybe I've blamed You too
But You would not forsake me
'Cause only good things comе from You

[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into thе sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay"

[Bridge]
From beginning to the end, You're so close
You have never let me down and You won't
In the valleys, in the shadows, I know
You're so close, You're so close

[Chorus]
Though the mountains may be moved into the sea
Though the ground beneath might crumble and give way
I can hear my Father singing over me
"It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay"

[Outro]
"It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay"
I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be okayYou might also likeEmbed
