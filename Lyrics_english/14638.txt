Timbaland - Morning After Dark Ft. Soshy, Nelly Furtado (Turkish translation) lyrics [Nelly Furtado]
Come on, Timbo!


[Timbaland]
I will be the same when everything goes well
I will be the same as everything goes bad
Not the first
I will be the last closing
I don't know if I gave you a chance yet
Beautiful, I'm looking at your style
Do I think you're good enough? Yes
A way to understand this
Come to me, honey
He doesn't care, he's not afraid to be wild
He wants to upset
The question is - will it release them out?
Anyway, the hourglass is moving
Somehow, I'm not worried
Why can't you see where this is going?
Come on, let's discover

[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
(After the darkness-)
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(After the darkness-)
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
(After the darkness-)
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(In the morning after the dark)


[Soshy]
I have a little secret for you
I can never sleep at night
But every time I make every finger
I turn it into light
My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire burns my mind
Is this love or just desire?
This is something I can't explain
Am I the only one for you?
Because you are the only one for me
Wait for you
It came too long and I felt lonely
Looks bright and early
I want to close my eyes
This is an unusual story

(After the darkness-)
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(After the darkness-)
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
(After the darkness-)
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(In the morning after the dark)


[Nelly Furtado]
I need a little r.e.m but
I don't like to sleep alone
So as you hung up the phone
Come to buy me
I want to get into trouble
Then, you move me home
I want to hide
I just want to shake your bones
Yes i am a single
But I am not the only one
So let's work extra
And in this shift, let's stand up to the sun
Maybe we can create a turmoil
Maybe we can burn this city
Maybe I'll be your vampire
We can discover

[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]
When the cats go out, bats go out to play

Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(After the darkness-)
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
(After the darkness-)
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
(In the morning after the dark)


[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]
From darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness
(In the morning after the dark)
From darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness
(In the morning after the dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after the dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after the dark)
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
Dawn dismantled, disappear, be in your own way
When the cats go out, bats go out to play
Dawn dismantled, disappear, olembed in his own way
