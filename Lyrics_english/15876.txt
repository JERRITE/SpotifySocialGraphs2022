CNCO

[Verse 1: Erick Brian Colón & Christopher Vélez]
These are those desire to feel close, pronounce your name (your name)
Every second you are not with me is an eternity (eternity)
You appeared in my life when I was lost
And you gave me the best of you without asking anything else
[Pre-Caro: Zabdiel de Jesús & Joel Pimentel]
My head goes away if you say "I love you"
Under the moon, I dream you awake
For a caress, huh! You know that I die
And your mind and mine are in tune
You are the reason that makes my life
That melody that breaks the silence

[Chorus: CNCO]
What is happening?, That divine face
My medicine has become
And little by little I am healing
It is those lips that have me tied
Like crazy in love
Without realizing you, you have already conquered me
UOHH-UOHH, UOHH-UOHH, UOHH-UOHH

[Verse 2: Erick Brian Colón & Christopher Vélez]
I need your remedy, because I'm sick
I get the fever when I don't have your body
I don't know what happens to me, this is a mystery
But I heals with kisses on the neck
Miss come here, and give me that recipe that I like
That so convalescent I cannot live, if it is not next to you (if not next to you)

[Pre-Caro: Zabdiel de Jesús & Joel Pimentel]
My head goes away if you say "I love you"
Under the moon, I dream you awake
For a caress, huh! You know that I die
And your mind and mine are in tune
You are the reason that makes my life
That melody that breaks the silence

What is happening?, That divine face
My medicine has become
And little by little I am healing
It is those lips that have me tied
Like crazy in love
Without realizing you, you have already conquered me

[Bridge: Richard Camacho & Joel Pimentel]
And it is crazy
I am obsessed
I live in a sea of ​​doubts, if you are not by my side
Because she is my first love
It is as immense as the sun
It is so great that my heart fills with life

[Chorus: CNCO]
What is happening?, That divine face
My medicine has become
And little by little I am healing (little by little I am healing)
It is those lips that have me tied
As crazy in love (-ado)
Without realizing you, you have already conquered me

What is happening?, That divine face (what is happening baby?, Baby, baby)
My medicine has become (my medicine)
And little by little I am healing
It is those lips that have me tied
As crazy in love (baby)
Without realizing you, you have already conquered me
[Outro: Richard Camacho]
Without realizing she has conquered me, oh-oh-ohh-mmm9embed
