In a Heartbeat Lyrics[Intro: Frankie Rodriguez]
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
(Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Frankie Rodriguez & Joshua Bassett]
I scream at the top of my lungs, you keep it all bottled up
We're different that way (Different that way)
But please don't ever change (Don't ever change)
It might feel like it's only us
Lookin' for our kind of love, and maybe that's true
But I'm so glad that it's you
[Pre-Chorus: Frankie Rodriguez]
I wish you knew that you're fantastic
I'll be right here, whatever happens

[Chorus: Frankie Rodriguez]
When all's said and done
You'll always be the one that I keep comin' back to
In a heartbeat, I'd choose you
Hope you know you'll never dance alone
So, don't you worry, don't need to
In a hеartbeat, I'd choose you

[Verse 2: Frankie Rodriguez, Joshua Bassett & Both]
You make mе feel like myself
Why would I go anywhere else?
How crazy I am (Crazy I am)
Somehow, you understand (You understand), yeah
You're the sweetest guy I've ever met (I've ever met)
I'm as lucky as lucky can get, too good to be true
Knowin' somebody like you

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie Rodriguez, with Joshua Bassett]
I wish you knew that you're fantastic
But I don't have to tell you, this is magic

[Chorus: Frankie Rodriguez, Joshua Bassett & Both]
When all's said and done
You'll always be the one that I keep comin' back to
In a heartbeat, I'd choose you
Hope you know (I hope you know), you'll never dance alone
So, don't you worry, don't need to
In a heartbeat, I'd choose you

(Oh-oh-oh-oh) In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat, I'd choose you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Don't you worry, you can trust me, I won't lose you
The future, we can't control
But all I know is everything that I need
I have with the boy who chose me

[Chorus: Frankie Rodriguez, Joshua Bassett & Both]
When all's said and done
You'll always be the one that I keep comin' back to
In a heartbeat, I'd choose you
Hope you know (I hope you know), you'll never dance alone
So, don't you worry, don't need to
In a heartbeat, I'd choose you

[Outro: Frankie Rodriguez & Joshua Bassett]
You (In a heartbeat), you (In a heartbeat)
I'd choose you (In a heartbeat)
In a heartbeat
Ooh (In a heartbeat)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (In a heartbeat)
I'd choose you (In a heartbeat)
In a heartbeatEmbed
