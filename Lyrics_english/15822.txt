Lose with you Lyrics [lyrics of "Lose with you"]

[Verse 1]
If I'm stealing your heart
It is not to leave it saved
It is not to enclose it
In no cage
Bored

If I'm stealing your heart
It is not and then lose myself
And jump running
When sure
That it is mine
[Chorus]
And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
Dancing at the bottom of a bar
In an old city
Like bandits

And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
Another tequila with salt
If you want to get bad
But with me

[Verse 2]
If I'm stealing your heart
It is not for being a collector
It is not to frame it
Nor to show it
To my friends

So many people mean, they want to comment, and criticize
But in the end nobody else understands this madness
I can fly by your side, I can go up, I can go down
Eternal love is a sweetness of sweetness
And I want to enjoy it slowly, while hard

And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
Dancing at the bottom of a bar
In an old city
Like bandits

And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
Another tequila with salt
If you want to get bad
But with me

[Verse 3]
I've been dreaming of having you
From before meeting you
Come and tell me how, when and where
Your love is a fantasy
I dream it all day
And I'm looking for you like crazy at night

Let's fly to any city
To Havana, or Quito, or Bogot√°
Let's go to Paris, we go to Peru
I'm going to do you want if you want you
[Chorus]
And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
And the one who wants to find me
It can come to look for me
In your dress

And if I'm going to miss
I want to get lost with you
Another tequila with salt
If you want to get bad
But with me1embed
