No Limits Lyrics[Intro]
I don't got no limits
Black card don't got limits, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't got no limits (No)
Black card don't got limits (Yeah)
Life's hard, but I brought lemons (Yeah)
When I pull up, hoes in their feelings
Spend prices higher than the ceilings (High)
Bitches can't see me, windows tinted (Yeah)
All of these cars bought none of them rented
I ain't tryna make new friends, got requests still pendin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse]
I only fuck with my old friends
Especially when I'm spendin' (Yeah)
I can't fake with fake bitches
Never been good at pretendin'
Dani get the party bussin' like a semi
Love drunk every time they see me
No need to crack the Remy or the Henny
This beat stupid, make me act silly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I don't got no limits (No)
Black card don't got limits (Yeah, yeah)
Life's hard, but I brought lemons (Ayy)
When I pull up, hoes in their feelings (Okay)
Spend prices higher than the ceilings (Ayy)
Bitches can't see me, windows tinted
All of these cars bought none of them rented (Yeah)
I ain't tryna make new friends, got requests still pendin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't got no limits (I don't)
Black card don't got limits (I don't)
Life's hard, but I brought lemons (Damn)
When I pull up, hoes in their feelings (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Spend prices higher than the ceilings (Ayy)
Bitches can't see me, windows tinted (Yuh)
All of these cars bought none of them rented
I ain't tryna make new friends, got requests still pendin' (Woo)You might also like2Embed
