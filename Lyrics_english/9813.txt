Out There Lyrics"Sanctuary"

[FROLLO]
The world is cruel
The world is wicked
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city
I am your only friend
I who keep you, feed you, teach you, dress you
I who look upon you without fear
How can I protect you, boy
Unless you always stay in here?
Away in here
(spoken)
Remember what I've taught you, Quasimodo

[FROLLO, QUASIMODO]
You are deformed I am deformed
And you are ugly And I am ugly
And these are crimes for which
The world shows little pity
You do not comprehend You're my defender
Out there, they'll revile you
As a monster I am monster
Out there, they will hate
And scorn and jeer Only monster
Why invite their curses and their consternation?
Stay in here
Be faithful to me I'm faithful
Grateful to me I'm grateful
Do as I say
Obey
And stay in here I'll stay in here

[FROLLO, spoken]
Remember, Quasimodo.  This is your sanctuary

"Out There"

...My sanctuary...

[QUASIMODO]
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them, but part of them

And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there, all I ask is one
To hold forever, out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give, what I'd dare
Just to live one day out there!

Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I were in their skin, I'd treasure every instant
Out there, strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there, like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent one day out there!Embed
