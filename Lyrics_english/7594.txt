Unpretty - radio version LyricsI wish i could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today (yeah)
My outside looks cool
My inside are blue
Every time I think i'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways
But its all the same
At the end of the day
I have my self to blame
I'm just trippin
Chorus:
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That mac can make
But if you can look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then i'll get back to me (hey)
My outside looks cool
My inside are blue
Everytime I think I'm throgh
It's because of you
I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Could be i'm trippin
Repeat Chorus 2x
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
