Letâ€™s Go Lyrics[Intro]
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
You might also like[Chorus]
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go5Embed
