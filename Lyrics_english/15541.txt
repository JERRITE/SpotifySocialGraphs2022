TranslationPortuguêsno I remember Lyrics [I don't remember "letter of" I remember "]

[Intro: Thalia & Natti Natasha]
Yeah, Yeah
I don't remember what I did
That they tell you, it didn't happen, it didn't happen
And that I rode your horns
I don't remember that, it didn't happen, it didn't happen

[Pre-Caro: Thalia]
They may be right (UOH-OH)
But don't shout like this (uoh-oh)
That hurts my head, I love you alone (only to you)
For me there is only one (uoh-oh)
But if makes you happy (UOH-OH)
Know that I was with another, let's say yes
[Chorus: Natti Natasha & Thalia]
But I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen
I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen

[Verse 1: Natti Natasha]
I just remember that I was pretty
To 'the crazy world with my belt
A dose of beauty with dynamite
Attractive as Queen Aphrodite
To'a Night Perrié (Aeh-Aeh)
With hand on the wall (AEH-AEH)
And I don't know what happened to me after
I think I passed my drinks

[Pre-Coro: Thalia & Natti Natasha]
They may be right (UOH-OH)
But don't shout like this (uoh-oh)
That hurts my head, I love you alone
For me there is only one (uoh-oh)
But if makes you happy (UOH-OH)
Know that I was with another, let's say yes

[Choir: Thalia & Natti Natasha]
But I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen
I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen

You have nothing to say, hard face
You said at ten and you arrived at one
The other time, and I was waiting for you
I also have the right to have a good time
You have nothing to say, hard face
I said that at ten and I arrived at three
Well, it may be that it was the four
I went to have a good time

[Pre-Coro: Thalia & Natti Natasha]
They may be right (UOH-OH)
But don't shout like this (uoh-oh)
That hurts my head, I love you alone (only to you)
For me there is only one (uoh-oh)
But if makes you happy (UOH-OH)
Know that I was with another, let's say yes

[Choir: Thalia, Natti Natasha & Thalía]
But I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen
I don't remember, I don't remember
And if I don't remember, that did not happen

[Outro: Thalia]
I don't remember, I don't remember, no
It did not happen, that did not happen
And that I rode your horns
I don't remember that
It did not happen, it did not pass4embed
