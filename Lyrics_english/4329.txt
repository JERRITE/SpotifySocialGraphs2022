[Verse 1: Wisin & Alberto Stylee]
The tíguere left, go hunting
I'm going to try the aim, you are a chulería (PAM-PAM-PAM)
It would be an honor for you to do me company
The party started at night
From here we left by day (lit '; wuh)
If I hit myself, don't leave
Let it drive you
Of the urban genre I am the axis (aha)
Mommy, I am yours to break me (oh!)
Give it, delay it for being cleared (heh)
Guerrilla, when I corner you and in front of you I stop
Your vital signs accelerate
Keep dancing, keep drinking, from here nobody leaves
And if-just does not stop ', don't stop', don't stop '(wuh; heh)
(Enemy, I'm going there; Ajá; tra-tra-tra)

[Verse 2: Yandel & Franco El Gorila]
That steals a kiss

[Verse 3: Franco El Gorilla & Alberto Stylee]
This is going to be a classic pa 'to' fans (hah)
Those before, those now but well galactic

Of the old woman and seems to be taken out of plastic (prra)
The night is pa 'ti, pa' me, pa 'that dances more than a crockery
And you look good, you are well, well delicious
She dances as a goddess, moves and destroys me
And you look good, you are well, well delicious
My bionic wife (rrra)
When he sings he sings more than the symphony
He wants whiskey, lemon and tonic water (PRRA)
The Super Sonic (PRRA)
Like Batman and Batichica in Gothic City (PRRA)
(Enemy, I'm going there)
