Tell Me What You’re Made Of LyricsYou will save yourself with anyone
You find yourself in a shield of iron

Whatever you do keeps me waiting
Whatever you do keeps me awake

So tell me what you're made of
‘Cause that’s what I’m afraid of
Tell me what you're made of
That’s what I’m afraid of
…is what I’m afraid ofYou might also likeEmbed
