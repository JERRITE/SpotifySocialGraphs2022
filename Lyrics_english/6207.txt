Carry on (acoustic) LyricsI won't break
Down this way
I will hold on for one more day
If you'll help me make
Myself feel
Something so much more than this
Something thats real
I'll live, I'll love, I'll carry on
Pretending I don't notice that you're gone...

But, god I miss you
So much it hurts sometimes
And I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by
Why didn't I notice
That you were not quite fine?
Now I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by...
Tell me why
Make me see
How my giving up, giving is isn't what's best for me
You know I've tried
But I am terrified, by all I should believe
I need to know to carry on
Pretending I don't notice that you're gone...

But, god I miss you
So much it hurts sometimes
And, I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by
Why didn't I notice
That you were not quite fine?
Now I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by...

And I may not always
Be there when you call my name
And I cannot promise
That the things you love in this life won't change
But I will be with you
In all that you say and do
'Cause you are part of me
And I will always love you...
You might also likeBut, god I miss you
So much it hurts sometimes
And, I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by
Why didn't I notice
That you were not quite fine?
Now I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by...

I took for granted
That you were in my life
Now I can't bring us back to
All the days gone by...

I always loved you
I miss you all the time
I promise I'll remember
All the days gone by..Embed
