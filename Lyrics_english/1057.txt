Be Alright (Acoustic) Lyrics[Intro]
Damn, I miss you

[Verse 1]
Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Through the storm and through the clouds, bumps on the road and upside down
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night, don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
[Verse 2]
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, oh I love you
[Chorus]
And everything's going to be alright
Be alright, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
You know that I care for you, I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through anything

[Chorus]
And everything's going to be alright
Be alright

[Outro]
Through the long nights and the bright lights, don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alrightYou might also like4Embed
