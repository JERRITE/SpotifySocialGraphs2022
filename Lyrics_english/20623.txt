Spoon Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sippin’ bad habits in the break of day
Trip on fast lovers like come get with me
Looking damn hard to find an easy way, easy way
I gotta walk my demons, need a fresh air
I keep them in their leash, they're much strong and wild
Far to where I'm heading ‘cause I need a ride, need a ride

[Chorus]
So spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
Spoon me, baby, you can't spoon too tight
Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
Spoon me, dick on my booty now
Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
Spoon me, baby, you can't spoon too tight
Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
Spoon me, dick on my booty now
[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah

[Verse 3]
Pulling up roots, ripping your cocoon
Spread the wings wide, let our spirit bloom
Then we make love in the purple gloom, purple gloom, yeah
You gotta let your dreamer out sometimes, to play
Pretend of what you need and what you tied away
Get ready for the storming and baby clouds will break, clouds will break

[Chorus]
So spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
Spoon me, baby, you can't spoon too tight
Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
Spoon me, dick on my booty now
Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
Spoon me, baby, you can't spoon too tight
Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
Spoon me, dick on my booty now

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, hands on my boobie, yeah
(Yeah, you gotta, yeah) Spoon me, spoon me tonight, yeah

[Outro]
So spoon me, spoon me tonight (You gotta), yeah
Spoon me, baby (Yeah), you can't spoon too tight (You gotta)
Spoon me (Yeah), hands on my boobie, yeah (You gotta)
