Yeah, what 'bout now?
Huh? Yeah, what 'bout now?
Ooh, yeah, what 'bout now?

It's up
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Keed talk to 'em

[Chorus]
Walked in, walked in (Woo), this Bentley truck, you can crawl in it (Say what?)
Gucci sweatsuit, yeah, they thought I was joggin' (Yeah, yeah)
I'm just gettin' these front-ends, these back-ends, these racks in (No cap)
Nigga, fuck your plug, heard he taxin', we whack him (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm ballin' out, I got bad bitches at my house, yeah (No cap)
Yeah, that ho too lazy, I get in her mouth then I kick her out (Boom-boom-boom)
Yeah, Chanel shoebox full of racks, no safe in the house (Chaney-ney)
Yeah, these bitches see me bring these racks to the club, they fallin' out (Rack, rack, racks)

I'ma Milly Rock, yeah (Woo), with that Richard Mille (Richard Mille)
Yeah, these niggas envy, put racks on their head like beanies (Rack, rack, racks)
Shit, I crashed the scat pack, but it was not rented (Skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, these racks in my pants extra green like spinach (Say what?)
