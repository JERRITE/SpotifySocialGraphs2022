Cartoon People Lyrics[Verse 1]
It doesn't really matter if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger than the rest of us he'll promise you that, I'm glad, I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks and then he's knocking them back
I've never seen someone who wears a sad little mask like that, like that

[Chorus]
The only guy that has got you in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with someone else's plans
She chooses life and then she chooses her man
[Verse 2]
It doesn't really matter if I'm happy or sad
In any case, I look at him, my life ain't half as bad, as bad

[Chorus]
The only guy that has got you in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with someone else's plans
He chooses life and then she chooses a man
He's picking it up but she don't give a damn

[Post-Chorus]
Hold me, it's a crisis that we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting an American war

[Bridge]
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away

[Post-Chorus]
Hold me, it's a crisis that we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting an American war

[Chorus]
The only guy that has got you in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with someone else's plans
She chooses life and then she chooses her man

Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe there's a fire today
Maybe it's not going away
Maybe it's not going away4Embed
