Second Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
I take a second walk down the street of fame
I've paid it off and paid for it again
All these miserable feelings never end
But to fall and be down's something I transcend

[Verse 2]
I've been a meal of mine and slid down my throat
And all I'm facing is one more way to go
Died so many times and then reappeared
All death looks like to me is a word that causes fear
[Outro]
I'm taking my place
In a world with different space
No time at all to accept how you move
Be who you are, do what you do, not win or lose
