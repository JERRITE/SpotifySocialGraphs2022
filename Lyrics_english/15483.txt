I don't need lyrics ["I don't need you"

[Intro]
And you left without telling me where
Let me talk to you
What you made me feel

Because you were more pending to another
To whom you did not hide when leaving
And I don't want to live like this
[Verse: 1]
That I no longer have love for you
No anymore, I have a solution
My song sounds
Today I want to give you, just a great lesson

And this reaction was your confession
That serious mistake in your situation
I no longer allow
That hide me like this

[Chorus]
Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance anymore, no
I don't love you for me

Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance anymore, no
I like to love me

[Verse: 2]
And I left you without saying anything
Looking at infinity
Shooting your ego
Oh, I don't need you anymore, hey
You Might Also Likeahora sees with your friends
And tell them that he is queen no longer wants to be with you
That of your lies I don't want to be more witness
And it is that I get fixed

Rope shot and I'm no more
No matter how much it costs you to accept
I don't feel like you anymore

And there is no time to
I ask what happened
I no longer have a forgiveness

[Chorus]
Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance, no
I don't love you for me

Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance, no
I like to love me

Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance, no
I don't love you for me
Oh Nanana, Oh Nanana, Yeah
I don't want that dance, no
I like to love me

[Outro]
And you left without telling me where
Let me talk to you
What you made me feel ... embed
