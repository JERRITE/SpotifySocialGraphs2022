Turn Off The Lights (Cloonee Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone now, now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights
[Bridge]
Diamonds, they fade
Your words are sinking
Down, down in my chest
What are you thinking?

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone now, now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the

Turn off the, turn off the, turn off the, turn off the
Turn off the, turn off the, turn off the, turn off the
Turn off, turn off, turn off, turn off
Turn off, turn off, turn off, turn off
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Turn off the lights

Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lightsEmbed
