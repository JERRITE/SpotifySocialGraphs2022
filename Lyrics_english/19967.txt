DEADSET RADIO FUTURE Lyrics[Intro]
Welcome to a time where man and mind do not compete
Where the present and the past are obsolete
Welcome to the future

[Chorus]
Tell me, Mr. Future Man
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this?
[Verse 1]
Because I swear to God, if something do not change
I'm gonna freak out (I'm gonna freak out)
I don't know what's wrong with everybody
They should seek help (The only thing they say is)

[Bridge]
"You're different than me so we can't agree"
"I don't care about you, I only care about me" (Oh no)
"You're different than me so we can't agree"
"I don't care about you, I only care about me"

[Verse 2]
But I'm not like that
I guess that's why I spend my life alone
Mr. Future Man, can you tell me if I end up alone?
(We... all... do...)
I'm lost in the void, I think the walls are closing in on me
Where did the sun go? It rain on me everyday
I been prayin' out to God, but he show me no sympathy
That's okay, I only believe in me anyway
The world is ending, I just let it shake (Oh, yeah)
If my heart hurts, I just let it break (Oh, ayy)
They pray to the sky, I just let 'em pray (Oh, yes)
I ain't seen an angel in like hunnid days (Run it back)

Tell me, Mr. Future Man
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this?
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this? (Does it get better?)
Does it get better than this?8Embed
