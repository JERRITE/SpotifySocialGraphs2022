Had Me At Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Around this time when the sun comes up
Still trying to decide if I'm good enough
You live in the moment, doing what you wanna
I guess you wanna stay losing out on love
Hiding out trying to find yourself
In a broke down car getting drunk somewhere
You tell me all the time you don't trust yourself
When everything is fine you relapse

[Chorus]
You keep running away from me
Don't want to wait for me
But I've been waiting all this time for you
Your friends are saying I'm bad for you
They don't like my attitude
But I'm the best you'll never know
You had me, you had me
You had me at goodbye
You had me, you had me
You had me at goodbye
[Verse 2]
Drink away the day
Smoke another jay
You trying to escape from reality
I can see it in your face
You've been dealing with some pain
So to compensate you go and take it out on me
Wishing you could pull up in a Bentley (Skrrt)
Oh so trendy
Credit card on frenzy
Living life on an empty
You tell me all the time that you love yourself
But when everything is fine you relapse

[Chorus]
You keep running away from me
Don't want to wait for me
But I've been waiting all this time for you
Your friends are saying I'm bad for you
They don't like my attitude
But I'm the best you'll never know
You had me, you had me
You had me at goodbye
You had me, you had me
You had me at goodbyeYou might also like1Embed
