My Girl Lyrics[Intro]
It's Maurice Moore baby
Yeah
Let's Go!

[Verse 1]
I don't need no validation
Just give me some conversation now
If you down, if you down, down
You give me your number
I return the favor
Welcome to my spot girl this mi casa
Got an expensive taste
She want some lobster well I got ya
Body rocking but I ain't gon' say it
You hear that too often
She don't want no strings attached
Well baby let me cut 'em off ya, eh?

[Pre-Hook 1]
Why you pretending babe
Like you so comfortable
Ya nigga don't do nothing for you
But you doing the most
Girl I like it when you lonely
And you blow up my phone
Say I be there in a minute
To give you what you want

[Pre-Hook 2]
Baby, your body is taking over me
Bout to lose my mind
And I don't wanna ever leave
Cause you are...

[Hook]
My girl quit playing baby
You should be my girl
Quit playing wit 'em
Girl you should be my girl
Quit playing baby
You should be my girl
My girl
My girl
You might also like[Verse 2]
I don't need no validation
Just give me your concentration
If you down, if you down, down
Give you my love and you return the favor
Yo man give you some problems?
I got ya
If you ever second-guessing
Then realize you got some options
It won't cost ya
Girl I, girl I, girl I, girl I do this often
If you order side a salad bae I toss it

[Pre-Hook 1]
Why you pretending babe
Like you so comfortable
Ya nigga don't do nothing for you
But you doing the most
Girl I like it when you lonely
And you blow up my phone
Say I be there in a minute
To give you what you want

[Pre-Hook 2]
Baby, your body is taking over me
Bout to lose my mind
And I don't wanna ever leave
Cause you are...
[Hook]
My girl quit playing baby
You should be my girl
Quit playing wit 'em
Girl you should be my girl
Quit playing baby
You should be my girl
My girl
My girl

[Outro]
I don't need no validation
Just give me your concentration
Babe
Are you down, are you down, down
Down down
Are you down, are you down, down
Saying my girl
Are you down, are you down, down
Babe
