Attention
Sign

[Verse 1]
On his knees, asking me for a lesson (Yeah, Yeah)
You know what to master you is my motivation (ah, ah)
To the ground and give me a hundred, I want to see you work (like this, Yeah)
And when you can't anymore, maybe it gives you piety

Animate and you will see
How dopamina I will free
Every fantasy, baby
An exemplary apprentice
Always ask you for more

To the ground
Give me a hundred

[Verse 2]
The lowest instincts available (Yeah, Yeah)
In the skin you carry satisfaction marks
To the ground and give me Ci–µn, I want to see you work (like this)
Tminate in the dark, we give an immoral walk

[Pre-car]
Animate and you will see
How dopamina I will free
Every fantasy, baby
An exemplary apprentice
Always ask you for more
