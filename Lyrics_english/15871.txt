I gave you lyricsme I lost at some strange point 
 Among your beautiful hips your way 
 And your caresses and that kind form 
 With which you make me happy 

 I asked you if you wanted to be my girlfriend 
 You snatched me a kiss 
 It was such a nice time 
 I don't know what to say 
 I belong to you 
 I give you a bit of heaven 
 I want my lips a tea 
 Of my hands the caresses 
 What will make you feel 
 What I feel for you 

 I give you my essential my whole world 
 And even if it seems absurd 
 I had never found anyone 
 That you resemble you 
 You have ten in your profile 

 I give you the heart just to you 

 I give you a bit of heaven 
 I want my lips a tea 
 Of my hands the caresses 
 What will make you feel 
 What I feel for you 

 I give you my essential my whole world 
 And even if it seems absurd 
 I had never found anyone 
 That you resemble you 
 You have ten in your profile 
 You might also like a heart gift only to you2embed
