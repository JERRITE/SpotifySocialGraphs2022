I Canâ€™t Quit Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hangin' around, hittin' the ground, dead in the water
Suckin' it up, fuckin' it up, a favorite daughter
Takin' a swing, everything goin' 'round in circles
Takin' a hit, this is it, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I can't quit
I'm over it

[Verse 2]
Shutting it up, cutting me up with broken glasses
Heaven above, been learning to love in evening classes
Get a new man and go to work out with your sister
Talk in a bit, but this it, I'm over it
[Chorus]
I can't quit
I'm over it
I can't quit
I'm over it

[Refrain]
You can't change me, can you?
You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?
And I can't offer that much to you

[Verse 3]
Havin' it out, livin' in doubt with no defenses
Tighten the rope, and talkin' of hope in different tenses
Callin' my friends and tellin' the only one that answers
It's hard to admit, but this it, I'm over it

[Chorus]
I can't quit
I'm over it
(I'm so dramatic)
I can't quit
(I'm so dramatic, I panicked)

[Refrain]
You can't change me, can you?
You can't offer that much to me
Oh you can't offer change, can you?
And I can't offer that much to you
You might also like[Outro]
I can't quit
(I'm so dramatic)
I'm over it
(Hangin' around, go underground down in my basement)
I can't quit
(Suckin' it up, fuckin' it up with your replacement)
I'm over it
(Takin' a swing, everything goin' round in circles)
I can't quit
(Takin' a hit, this it)
I'm over it4Embed
