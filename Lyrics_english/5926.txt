Longest Night LyricsIs it dark where you are
Can you count the stars where you are
Do you feel like you are a thousand miles from home
Are you lost where you are
Can you find your way when you're so far
Do you fear where you are
A thousand nights alone

So here we are, set into motion
We'll steal a car and crash in the ocean
You and I, caught in a fading light
On the longest night
It's enough just to find love
It's the only thing to be sure of
So hard to let go of
A thousand times or more
I was close to a fault line
Heaven knows you showed up in time
Was it real
Now I feel like I'm never coming down

So here we are, set into motion
Steal a car, crash in the ocean
You and I, caught in a fading light
On the longest night

I recall when we were together
Even now it seems like forever
So alive, caught in a fading light
On the longest night

Can we go too far to find
What is waiting here
A little fall from grace
On the longest night

Can we go too far to find
What is waiting here
It'll take a little time to open up again
Is it dark where you are
Can you count the stars where you areYou might also likeEmbed
