I Think About You All The Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
You really got me blue
I don't smoke, but I do when I'm with you
Our friends are in the back
Waiting for me to come back, but I don't want to
You really got me bad
With a girl I didn't know you had
She's laying in your bed
But you're fucking with my head
You want me where I'm at
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you know I know you're no good
But I know you know I'd love you if I could

[Chorus]
You make your moves, I fold
The stakes are high for having someone to hold
You're keeping score and you're coming out just fine

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I think about you all the time, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think about you all the time

[Verse 2]
You're everything to me
I'm the one you call when you can't sleep
I pray away the sun
Because when the morning comes
You always leave

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you know I know you're no good
But I know you know I'd hate you if I could

[Chorus]
You make your moves, I fold
The stakes are high for having someone to hold
You're keeping score and you're coming out just fine
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I think about you all the time, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I think about you all the, I think about you all the
I think about you all the time (I think about you all the time)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I think about you all the time (I think about you all the time)
I think about you all the time (I think about you all the time)
Ah-ah-ah (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I think about you all the (I think about you all the time)1Embed
