Good Day to Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who really know what rights all the wrongs anyway?
Who really cares what people do or say?
And no matter where this life takes me I'll never let it compromise (Compromise)
To much luck to bet it on do or die

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
[Verse 2]
Lived by the rules you that you gave me and fell apart
All the wrong turns down a dead end street so far
I stretched my wings and breathe in different day
Alone and broken is the price I pay
But that's ok

[Chorus]
I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die

[Bridge]
Never thought out a life
Taking all I can take
It's time to say goodbye
It's a good day to die

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
You might also like[Outro]
'Cause I've seen everything
And I know all I know
It's time I said goodbye today
With all I know
It's time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to dieEmbed
