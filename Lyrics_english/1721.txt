Katana lyrics [verse 1: STED.D]
We are in the underworld
The Devil in Prada is the most lady (the most lady)
In this preaching the facet of meaning, but who roared us?
(Who roared us?)
Not life, but a fairy tale where the wolves ate that small
Burst into battle against thunder lightning
Tear me the tower, I'm so -headed
No one died, but again
One hundred vile snakes? -This is Lova-Lova
This pack of clowns is to you
But soon midnight, and the bell broke out
Life is not a fairy tale, and thank God
We are a flock of dricks - pour flame in the throat
Put the place of the treasure for the people
I carry my cross, but here not Calvary
Zeus pierces my flesh with thunder
I shoot in Stories this strange attack
The goddess puts me like video
Leaving me no choice
Overthrow everyone and become a new leader
Among the critics, becoming an idol instead of shitty wigger's
Bringing with eternal flame and do not burn out (and do not burn out)
[Bridge: STED.D]
We are at the Grail, I'm drunk again
Ducaman and stole, bed, bedroom
Where only the gods know where the banner of our victory will hide (the gods know)
Here is a game without rules - I hide a face without fear in a dragon flock (dragon flock)
Ice heart, updates a thick flame (thick flame)

[Ekuphav: Obladaet]
My house without walls, I'm just a shadow here
I attacked the trail, I will find you all
My house without walls is open to everyone
I was born in the light, I was born in darkness

[Chorus: Obladaet]
Around the darkness, I drain the glass
Katana in my hand - flying to the astral
Where am I? I disappeared again
I see my way-this is the holy path (Ok, Yeah-Yeah)
You are right again
Katana in the hand
Struck more than once, and you are right again
Around the darkness, I drain the glass
Katana in my hand - flying to the astral
Where am I? I disappeared again
I see my way-this is the holy path (Ok, Yeah-Yeah)
You are right again
Katana in the hand
Struck more than once, and you are right again

We tear off the towers and twist your heads
She is naked - I'm in her twice
Tear my head, here is immediately new
I mix again the poison in bu-ma-oks
Beat me - this is our derby, this is our time (Yeah, Yeah)
The race, where every first is the tower up and twice into the sky (twice in the sky)
You are already at the goal with each nerve, but does not smear the first (ugh)
You make a mistake - but it is also true, this is your faith
You are the first to drop out - give me back the time, as in black holes (yeah)
This is a controversial conclusion, but the trunk in his hand, as if he had pulled out with the root
(I keep balance)
He fell on the mobile, putting half, making the right choice (YEAH)
How pieces of meat are resting on villas, call the grave (BRR)
I overtook them again (uh)
Every day I see only psychos (Yeah-Yeah)
Without mannequins and living in appearance
I forgot that the same, but I do not make discounts (I do not make discounts)
This is not in my power
I saw in my dreams that I didn't even dream
The pupil is so tired, I see that symbol again
Weaknesses torment, but this is the force

[Ekuphav: Obladaet]
My house without walls, I'm just a shadow here
I attacked the trail, I will find you all
My house without walls is open to everyone
I was born in the light, I was born in darkness
[Chorus: Obladaet]
Around the darkness, I drain the glass
Katana in my hand - flying to the astral
Where am I? I disappeared again
I see my way-this is the holy path (Ok, Yeah-Yeah)
You are right again
Katana in the hand
Struck more than once, and you are right again
Around the darkness, I drain the glass
Katana in my hand - flying to the astral
Where am I? I disappeared again
I see my way-this is the holy path (Ok, Yeah-Yeah)
You are right again
Katana in the hand
I stumbled more than once, and you are right again15MBED
