Happy If You’re Happy (Extended Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don’t like small talk
With some neighbors on our block
But I’ll stand with you all day
You never let me drive here
Afraid we won’t survive
But I’ll ride with you all day

[Chorus]
You like the city lights
I like the stars at night
If you’re happy in New York
I’ll bring you home
I’ll sleep in museums
While you take all day to see 'em
Meet me in the lobby
And I’ll bring you home
[Verse 2]
I stress in grocery stores
When there's too much to look for
But I'll push your cart all day (Hey!)
You never hear your phone
It rings and you're alone
But I call you everyday

[Chorus]
You like the city lights
I like stars at night
If you’re happy in New York
I’ll bring you home
I’ll sleep in museums
While you take all day to see em
Meet me in the lobby
And I’ll bring you home

[Verse 3: Skizzy Mars]
Ah, Skizz
Ya, Ya, and girl you one of a kind
You was, we just kicked it a couple of times
You were posted at the bar with a couple of nines
But you were a dime
Everything about your bod's top of the line
I was looking but it's hard to find
When you pull up it's all lies
And you're all mine
'Cause when you're happy I be feelin' great
You know I'm only smilin' when you're smilin' babe
True love is evident
The east coast your element
Something about you is heaven-sent
So what I want is irrelevant
You say you're happy in New York so let's go back
You say you miss home? Yeah I know that
Put that Al Green on that's a throwback
We don't need to go out we can relax

I’m only happy when you are happy
So I’ll shave tonight (Uh, yeah)
I’m only happy when you are happy
Won’t yell if you bite

[Chorus]
You like the city lights
I like stars at night
If you’re happy in New York
I’ll bring you home
I’ll sleep in museums
While you take all day to see em
Meet in the lobby
And I’ll bring you homeEmbed
