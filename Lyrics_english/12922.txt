Woman is a Word LyricsI'm only an image of what you see
I'm only an image of what you see

I'm only an image of what you see
You don't know me

You don't know me
I'm only a woman if woman is a word
I'm only a woman if woman is a word
I'm only a woman if woman is a word
Bird to a bee
Bird to a bee
Bird to a bee
I'm always coming on the inside
I'm always coming on the inside
I'm always coming on the inside
When you're coming
When you're coming on the outside
I'm only a figure if you can see my frame
I'm only a figure if you can see my frame
I'm only a figure if you can see my frame
Fire with no
Fire with no
Fire with no flame

I'm only a struggle if I get in your way
I'm only a struggle if I get in your way
I'm only a struggle if I get in your way
You made the road
Made the road one-way
