Heaven Must Be Like This Lyrics[Intro]
You know what I think heaven is?
I think heaven is you
You know that? Listen

[Verse 1]
A place where I can find happiness
A place close to your loveliness
Somewhere to rest my aching mind
Where there's no time, your love is divine
[Hook]
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this

[Verse 2]
The sweet and sour taste of love
We just made a good place in the shade
A glass of lemonade
Don't be afraid, just love

[Hook]
Heaven must be
Heaven must be like this
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this

[Bridge]
Wrap your love around me
Listen, girl
There's no place like you
You're all the places

[Verse 3]
A place where I can find happiness
A place close to your loveliness
Somewhere to rest my aching mind
Where there's no time, your love is divine
You might also like[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The sweet and sour taste of love
We just made a good place in the shade
A glass of champagne
Your lips are flames, I'll go insane

[Hook]

[Break]

[Verse 5]
Somewhere to rest my aching mind
Where there's no time, your love is divine

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
The sweet and sour taste of love
We just made a good place in the shade
A glass of champagne
Your lips are flames, I'll go insane

[Hook]
[Talking]
Something sweet, you
Kiss me again
Again
Kiss me again
