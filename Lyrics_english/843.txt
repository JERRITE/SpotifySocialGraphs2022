Happy Lost Lyrics ["Lost Happy Letter"]

[Intro: Danny Ocean]
To 'the world like it but I am the one who takes the photo
The best do not upload them, those are just for us'
Hey, has in Toa 'La' Capital 'several hearts' and broken dm, oh
Because I give it what others can

[Chorus: Danny Ocean]
That nobody does not come to assist
If I am 'Felice' Lost
That nobody comes to comment
In something that was already written
If I already finished, I will start again
I return to EMPO, I start again
Pеro with you, hey
Always with you, oh
[Verse 1: Floor 21]
Bae, no one does not 'control
I'm going to make a patch and with me know you
You have me floating
Leave me, I sing them, Yeah
It is to elevate mets
Your voice plots, mommy, makes me save me
I see you perfect, Yeah
My Cora and yours connect, Oh

[Chorus: Floor 21]
That nobody does not come to assist
If I am 'Felice' Lost
That nobody comes to comment
In something that was already written
If I already finished, I will start again
I start again, I start again
But with you, hey
Always with you, oh

[Saying: 21 & Danny Ocean floor]
To 'the world like it but I am the one who throws the photo
The best do not upload them, those are just for us'

[Verse 2: Floor 21]
This happens rarely, that my cora stumbles
I met your gaze and pursued her for months
This is what it seems, a love that does not age
From the first time, a kiss on the DF, Yeah
Nice is the love we have
Romantic I wear if something no 'baby'
Unique feeling when I do it '
No, I wish let's end

To 'the world like it but I am the one who takes the photo
