â€‹buzz cut (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Mitchy Collins]
Off-White Benz on the 1-0-1
Her face lights up as she's humming along
To my own song on the radio
It's cute as Hell 'cause she didn't know (She didn't know)
I didn't say 'cause she didn't ask
She's my future, forgive my past
So used to being cynical
She's something like a miracle

[Pre-Chorus: Mitchy Collins]
It's only a feeling
Until you make it more than that
[Chorus: Mitchy Collins]
It's the summer of the buzz cut
But you like my long hair
Red flags turn to pixie dust
It don't matter 'cause I don't care
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And I think that you're falling, you're falling, for me too
In the summer of the buzz cut
In the summer of the buzz cut, buzz cut
It's the summer of the buzz cut, buzz

[Verse 2: Mandy Lee]
Summer's fadin' but not these feels
That I got for you, haven't felt in years
It's something like a miracle
You make me feel invincible
You're goin' slow but my heart beats fast
Wanna stop the clocks, wanna make this last
I'm scared it's too soon to let you know
I play it cool but I know it shows

[Pre-Chorus: Mandy Lee]
It's only a feeling
Until you make it more than that

[Chorus: Mandy Lee]
It's the summer of the buzz cut
But you like my long hair
Red flags turn to pixie dust
It don't matter 'cause I don't care
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And I think that you're falling, you're falling, for me too
In the summer of the buzz cut
In the summer of the buzz cut, buzz cut
It's the summer of the buzz cut, buzz

Sometimes you don't know what you got
Sometimes you don't believe it
Sometimes you don't know what you got
Until you see her leaving

[Chorus: Mitchy Collins & Mandy Lee]
It's the summer of the buzz cut
But you like my long hair
Red flags turn to pixie dust
It don't matter 'cause I don't care
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And I think that you're falling, you're falling, for me too
In the summer of the buzz cut
In the summer of the buzz cut, buzz cut
It's the summer of the buzz cut, buzz

[Outro: Mitchy Collins & Mandy Lee, Mandy Lee]
In the summer of the buzz cut (Sometimes you don't know what you got)
Buzz cut (Sometimes you don't believe it)
It's the summer of the buzz cut (Sometimes you don't know what you got)
Buzz (Until you see her leaving)Embed
