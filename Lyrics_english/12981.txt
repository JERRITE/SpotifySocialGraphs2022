4ÆM Lyrics[Intro]
O—
Aphrodite
I wrote your constellation
Into the sky
S-s-s-s-s-sa
Suns at night

[Chorus]
I'm out late at 4 AM
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM
I'm out late at 4 AM
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM
[Post-Chorus]
4 AM, 4 AM
Falling down again
Unraveling

[Bridge]
Aphrodite
I wrote your constellation
Into the sky, ooh
S-s-s-s-s-sa
Suns at night

[Chorus]
I'm out late at 4 AM
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM
I'm out late at 4 AM
He says, "How's the weather, baby? How've you been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
I never doubt it at 4 AM

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, ah
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, ah
4 AM, 4 AM
Falling down again
