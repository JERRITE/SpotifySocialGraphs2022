I see in you the light Lyrics [Rapunzel]
Time that seeing distance
Time was seeing inside
I didn't imagine what I lost
And today, seeing the stars
And today, everything is clarity
From here I can see that it is where I must be

And the light at last
That fog was clarified
And the light at last
Now the sky is blue
It is real shining like this
I already changed the whole life
This time everything is different
I see in you the light
[INSTRUMENTAL]

[Eugene]
Time that chasing a dream
Time was in the dark
Time I had not seen how reality is
She here, look like star
She here, everything is clarity
If it is here, it is easy to see that here I want to be

[Rapunzel & Eugene]
And the light at last

[Eugene]
That fog was clarified

[Rapunzel & Eugene]
And the light at last

[RAPUNZEL]
Now the sky is blue

[Rapunzel & Eugene]
It is real shining like this already changed the whole life
This time everything is different
I see in you the light
