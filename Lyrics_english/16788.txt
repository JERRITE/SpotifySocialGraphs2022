Rowdy AF Lyrics[Intro]
Yo Zeph
This one's naughty bro

[Verse]
Just cause I don't drop
Tunes every week doesn't mean that I'm not in go mode
Bout to put the whole scene in a chokehold
I ain't quit I just work in slo mo
If I make it in grime with my boys I
'm splitting the band like yokoono
Bout to enya flow that's orinoco
You've had your time now let me have a go yo
In Manc I'm kind of a big deal
DJ spin back the tune like a pinwheel
Hear a lot of man talking about
Guns but they've got toys when their buying a kids meal
Oh what a fuckries
I was doing shows all over the country
But I don't need any promoters to book me
Record at my home, I'm comfy
Mix and master the shit on my own that's in house
When my tracks start hitting the roads best slow down
I'm back and little did you know I've grown now
Since E A stacking the quids and gained pounds
Done fire in the booth SB link up
The c Vs tonk as fuck, I'm so proud
In your rankings I'm not high up but
Soon I'm gonna give you the low down
I was putting Manny on the Map while
Living in Stockwell little did you know
Colindale Shadwell Tufnell Park lime
House, Manc boy getting busy on the roads
I was going studio all around the same
Time felt like I had millions of shows
Lord of the Mics getting skippy with the flows
Never forget my roots didsbury that's my hom
But people hate, why do they hate?
When I was a younger they called me a chav
That was never gonna make it
Like I was fake, but it didn't
Get me down I kept moving on
I don't care bout the time that it takes
YouTube comments they clown how I look
But they can't deny I spit rhymes with grace
And I excel in every style
I make Drill  Grime, Hiphop
Tt's just words to me murder beats to the third degree
So hot sit down and I burn the seat. To say
I'm not talented that's purgery
I talk mental health on 140 bp
M because I know how my words can reach
It's an experience you feel it immersively
How high can this one person reach
Suicidal last year now I'm centally stronger
I celebrate that
Got the drive back ima demonstrate that
Energetic from young I was never laid back
Lockdown didn't leave the house for two months
I'm aware I will never get the days back
About I'm not a boss don't ever play that
Who's Blizz? he's a boss whenever they askYou might also likeEmbed
