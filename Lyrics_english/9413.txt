Only Because of You Lyrics[VERSE]
In 24 hours
Our little world spins around
Taking it's time
And it doesn’t make a sound

[Chorus]
And the world keeps on turning
Only because of you

[VERSE]
In 28 days
The Moon circles the earth
Caught in her realm
Ever since her cosmic birth
[Chorus]
And the world keeps on turning
Only because of you

[VERSE]
In the course of 12 months
We travel round the sun
Coming full circle
To where it never had begun

[Chorus]
And the world keeps on turning
Only because of you

[VERSE]
Traversing the sky
Through galaxies and stars
It's just what we call them
When we think of them as ours

[Chorus]
And the world keeps on turning
Only bеcause of you

[OUTRO]
Because of you
Only bеcause of you
Of you
Of you
Of youYou might also likeEmbed
