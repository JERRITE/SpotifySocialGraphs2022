â€‹two reverse Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lay me down so
To let you leave
Tell me lies
I wanna see your eyes
Is it a crime to say
I still need you?
Crime, wanna feed you

[Chorus]
Light blue, dark blue, grey
Crimson trail
Straight through, stay don't stray
[Verse 2]
Grandmother, Juniper
Tell to me your recipe
Is it a cry I hear
From the deep wood?
Crying, reappear from
The weeds

[Chorus]
Light blue, dark blue, grey
Crimson trail
Straight through, stay don't stray

[Verse 3]
Through the jail
See the sun
Flat as a knife
Cold and white
To my home, two rivers
Through my home, two reverse
Is it a crime to do
What you ask me to?
