No one is going to love you like Yo-O-O-O-O-O-O

The silence says more than a thousand words
And he told me everything
That you will not return, Nou-Nou
I write these lines
And it's not for you to come back
[Chorus]
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me

[Verse 1]
You have not been by my side for a long time
We have not woke up together
I haven't seen you sleeping for a long time
A long time ago, I don't know
But I have missed you a lot
Time ago, time is still
And we still have time to love

[Pre-car]
We can sit and analyze together
Learn from our mistakes
You can have a thousand adventures, a thousand loves

[Chorus]
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me

I still wonder, how did I lose you?
Yes like Romeo and Julieta
We lived our relationship
I don't understand
How modesty end like this? Nope!
It is that of all, with you wanted ...
Pass the rest of my days

[Verse 3]
Sorry, I feel
Duty I feel
To confess feelings
That today live and die in my heart
Sorry, I feel
I have to be so, eh-eh
Let's see if one day
Where nobody is going to love you like me

[Verse 4]
No one is going to love you as I did
Nobody will love you as I loved you
Check with your heart, to see what it tells you
That my love was true and did not leave scars, nou
I know my baby
You can try other people, but none fills you
Who will make love to you better than me on the full moon?
Tell me, who will make all your sorrows joy?
Never say Never
That the world turns a thousand times
And my heart still abounds you
For your life a million people can spend
And the reality is that ...
[Chorus]
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me
Uoh, no! NOU-NOU-NOU-NOU
But nobody is going to love you like me
