Live for the Night Lyrics[Hook: Jahan]
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'

[Drop: Jahan]
I live for the night
[Verse 1: Yasmine]
I ain't tryna holla, get that ink upon my collar
Drink until it's nada
Isn't whiskey? I don't bother
My bitches ain't no dimes, they be motherfuckin' dollars
So we stack our drinks up high, skyscrapin' 'til we taller

[Refrain: Yasmine]
Ring, ring, hit that up
Show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough
Ring, ring, hit that up
Show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough

[Pre-Hook: Jahan]
I'ma do what I want, whatever
I'ma rage 'til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath
You know I'll sleep when I am dead

[Hook: Jahan]
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
You might also like[Drop: Jahan]
I live for the night
Free fallin'

[Verse 2: Yasmine]
I'm the grim reaper
When I'm blarin' out your speaker
Killin' off the weaker, welcome to the final feature
My head is in the clouds, you can say that I'm a dreamer
But I bang it super loud, turn that bitch into a screamer

[Pre-Hook: Jahan]
I'ma do what I want, whatever
I'ma rage 'til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath
You know I'll sleep when I am dead

[Hook: Jahan]
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'

I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
[Drop: Jahan]
I live for the night2Embed
