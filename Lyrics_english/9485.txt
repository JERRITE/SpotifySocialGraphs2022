The Damned LyricsI am damned
Tie my body with the chains of shame
Throw me away, let me into the flames
I need to feel myself

Running these endless corridors
These ghosts are in every corner
Chasing me, tearing me
I need to feel free

I’ve been inside for so much time
Give me the chance to show what I am
Maybe I can, but I can´t deny
Since the birth of our soul
I wait for your life
Reaching destructive madness
In the eyelids of lies
Laughing around this silence
Breaking the wisdom of mind
Mindless surround this lifeless
I blow hope full of dust
Dust is it all I am
I became my disease…

"Over the years, your shield begins to rust and is unable to stop all the bullets that you fired and they shot at you, and you realize that you were running in circles, always coming back, always craving the memories that never closes, but you don’t feel the same and there are wrinkles in your eyes… you’re still young; the time has molded the scars, when yesterday there was brown, today the red is flooding…”

I’ve been inside for so much time
Give me the chance to show what I am
Maybe I can, but I can´t deny
Since the birth of our soul
We ever have been one

The freedom is so ironical
When you think you can fly
Is when more buried you are

Then you think you must dig but instead
You prefer to stay in your shell
Where you feel safe

And the worms of self-destruction
Are biting your flesh but
You don’t really care about feel
You might also likeBecause you used to bleed
Like anyone else
How can you defeat something you can’t see?

You can’t run from your shadows

When your gears begins to disassemble
And your plastic wings start to fall
You realize that the road will never end

Expecting to find a better tomorrow
Packing your bag to run away from the winter
Escaping the past drowning in your riverEmbed
