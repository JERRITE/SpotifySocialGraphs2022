The Best Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
I, I believe
That the answer is more simple than we make it out to be
And you, you're just like me
Always end up in the places that we're not supposed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, we got lost sometimes, I know
But always get where we need to go
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, we got lost sometimes, I know
[Chorus]
They say the best days are yet to come but I know that ain't true
When the world gets the worst of me I'm still my best with you
We don't stare into the ocean, we just dive into the blue
They say the best days are yet to come but I know that ain't true

[Post-Chorus]
Oh love, we're livin' in it
Oh love, we're livin' in it
I'm still my best with you

[Verse 2]
I, I believe
We can answers all our problems with a simple melody
So sing, sing to me
Sing a song for every moment what we had and what will be

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, we got lost sometimes, I know
But always get where we need to go
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, we got lost sometimes, I know

[Chorus]
They say the best days are yet to come but I know that ain't true
When the world gets the worst of me I'm still my best with you
We don't stare into the ocean, we just dive into the blue
They say the best days are yet to come but I know that ain't true

Oh love, we're livin' in it
Oh love, we're livin' in it
I'm still my best with you

[Outro]
Oh love, we're livin' in it
I'm still my best with you2Embed
