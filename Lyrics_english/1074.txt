Better Than Today Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't read the headlines and I don't watch the news
'Cause I lose faith in something every time I do
Well, I don't mean to bury my head in the sand
But I'm just tryna live this life as best as I can

[Pre-Chorus]
Times get tough, but I don't give up
'Cause I know I'm not alone

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all reaching for something, and we're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
And we're all searching for somewhere, trying to find a way
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
[Verse 2]
It's not easy sleeping when I lay down in bed
'Cause I got all these worries running through my head
And it's hard to keep pushing forward when trouble pulls you back
And you wake up even further from a dream you had

[Pre-Chorus]
Times get tough, but I don't give up
'Cause I know I'm not alone

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all reaching for something, and we're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
And we're all searching for somewhere, trying to find a way
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better

[Bridge]
So just hold on when someone breaks you
Just hold on when fear shakes you
Just hold on when darkness takes you
Just hold on

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all reaching for something, and we're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow, tomorrow is better than today
So let's keep searching for somewhere, we're gonna find a way
To make tomorrow, tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow, tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow, tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow, tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow, tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow, tomorrow better than todayYou might also like2Embed
