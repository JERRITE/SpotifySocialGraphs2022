Always Tired Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm always tired, I just can't fight it
I'm always picking up my body, oh
Down with the fever and I'm drowning, yeah
I'm always tired, it's just a habit, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm taking my time, don't wanna talk
You're making me blind, yeah, you gotta stop
Do you ever know... How eyes lie?
Do you ever see how I'm–
[Chorus]
I'm always tired, I just can't fight it
I'm always picking up my body, oh
Down with the fever and I'm drowning, yeah
I'm always tired, it's just a habit, oh

[Verse 2]
A quarter to three, still rolling in bed
A party for me with demons in my head
Do you ever know... How eyes lie?
Do you ever see how I'm–

[Chorus]
I'm always tired, I just can't fight it, yeah
I'm always picking up my body, oh
Down with the fever and I'm drowning, yeah
I'm always tired, it's just a habit, oh

(What?)
(Yeah)

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, don't wanna talk
You're making me blind, yeah, you gotta stop

[Chorus]
I'm always tired, I just can't fight it
I'm always picking up my body, oh
Down with the fever and I'm drowning, yeah
I'm always tired, it's just a habit, oh
