21st Century Vampire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dark circles under my eyes
No sunlight up in my sky
Can't feel the pain, I'm immune

[Chorus]
I don't get tired
I'm a 21st century vampire, 21st century vampire
I guess I'm just meant to be sleepin' all day
I don't got no fucking life, I'm just a 21st century vampire
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid to die
I'll make your boyfriend cry
I'm howling at the moon

[Chorus]
I don't get tired
I'm a 21st century vampire, 21st century vampire
I guess I'm just meant to be sleepin' all day
I don't got no fucking life, I'm just a 21st century vampire
Yeah-yeah-yеah

[Bridge]
Save your heart for someonе who's got one
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
I don't get tired
I'm a 21st century vampire, 21st century vampire
I guess I'm just meant to be sleepin' all day
I don't got no fucking life, I'm just a 21st century vampire
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
