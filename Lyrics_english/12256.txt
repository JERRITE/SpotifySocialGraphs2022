Tired of You Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]
You can get all of me, my baby (My baby)
You take the air that I breathe, my baby (My baby)
You can't be scared of your dreams, no, baby (No, baby)
I'm fallin' in love again (Again)

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Yeah, I'm so tired of you, uh
Runnin' right back when I need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Plannin' on givin' it away)
'Cause I don't wanna deal with it no more
Baby, don't play with me, yeah
Runnin' right back when you need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Plannin' on givin' it away)
And you don't wanna deal with me no more
I'm runnin' out of luck so I don't give a fuck
I need someone I can believe in
'Cause I don't wanna cry no more (I don't wanna cry no more)
[Verse: Bleu]
You don't have to go, just chill for the night
Just come take my soul, it's yours for the night
Kissin' on your stretch marks, ooh girl, turn on the light
Hеr imperfections, ooh, girl, that's what I like
You wanna givе it away, you can give it away
Don't let me get in your way
These bitches, they mad and like, "Baby, you pretty today"
You lookin' so pretty today
Baby, come give me that, mm-hmm
Can I come over say, "Mmm-hmm"?
We makin' love you say, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. withBleu]
You can get all of me, my baby (My baby)
You take the air that I breathe, my baby (My baby)
You can't be scared of your dreams, no, baby (No, baby)
I'm fallin' in love again (Again)

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Yeah, I'm so tired of you, uh (I'm so tired of you)
Runnin' right back when I need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Plannin' on givin' it away)
'Cause I don't wanna deal with it no more (I don't wanna deal with it)
Baby, don't play with me (Oh, ooh-ooh)
Runnin' right back when you need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Ooh, ooh)
And you don't wanna deal with me no more
Yeah, I'm so tired of you, uh (I'm so tired of you)
Runnin' right back when I need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Plannin' on givin' it away)
'Cause I don't wanna deal with it no more (I don't wanna deal with it)
Baby, don't play with me (Oh, ooh-ooh)
Runnin' right back when you need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Ooh, ooh)
And you don't wanna deal with me no more
Woah, oh, woah
You might also like[Bridge: Bleu]
You never wanted this like I did
You never really had no idea
You had me drownin' in my feels, oh, ooh, oh
Love is a dangerous game
And you can get it all of me, my baby
You take the air that I breathe, oh baby
You can't be scared of your dreams, no, baby
Fallin' in love again (Fallin' in love again)

[Chorus: Bleu & H.E.R.]
Mm, I'm so tired of you, uh (I'm so tired of you)
Runnin' right back when I need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Plannin' on givin' it away)
'Cause I don't wanna deal with it no more
Baby, don't play with me (Ooh, ooh)
Runnin' right back when you need someone
Plannin' on givin' it away (Ooh, ooh)
And you don't wanna deal with me no moreEmbed
