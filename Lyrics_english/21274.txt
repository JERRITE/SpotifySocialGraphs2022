The Burden Of Being Wonderful LyricsWhy? In a world of ugly faces
Should I be allowed to be so hot
So many people without talent
Yet I was born with all the magical gifts, I got

The perfect body, the perfect face
It's like Gods best work all in one place
But the haters hate perfection, can't you see?
It's the burden being wonderful like me

How in a world that's so imperfect
Did I wind up with so much cool?
Friends never stick around too long
Never feel like they belong
Next to me they feel like a fool
I got the grace of a dancer, golden voice
People seem to hate me like I had a choice
Being this blessed is a lonely way to be
It's the burden being wonderful like me.. Like me

So you say you wanna hang around
Don't ever ask me to dumb it down
I'm a diamond, I'm gonna shine
Compared to everyone else
I'm like a whole damn diamond mine
Ohh yeah..

I'm just a Maserati in a world of Kias
Genius wouldn't  describe any of my ideas
If I was born in 1453 Leonardo Da Vinci would be jealous of me
But a world of Stevie Wonders would never see
It's the burden being wonderful like meYou might also likeEmbed
