Relight My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was runnin' blind like a silver-lining lover
Skies in my jaded mind led to places I could discover
So what do I say now? Yeah, what do I do
When every road leads back to you?
I open my eyes now, but I can't move
I can't move

[Chorus]
So won't you shine, shine, shine for me?
Start up a fire, be the light, don't hide from me
And when I feel that the world's too dark to see
Don't give up
Relight my love
[Drop]
Relight my love
Relight my love

[Verse 2]
You got all my lovin', give me everything
I can see the future whеn you take me by the hand
Oh, ooh
You got all my lovin', givе me everything
I can see the future when you take me by the hand
Oh, ooh

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine for me
Start up a fire, be the light, don't hide from me
And when I feel that the world's too dark to see
Don't give up
Stay, stay, stay with me
If I get lost, won't you find the way with me?
When it's too much and I fall in way too deep
Don't give up
Relight my love

[Drop]
Ooh, relight my love
Relight my love
Relight my love
Shine, shine, shine for me
Start up a fire, be the light, don't hide from me
And when I feel that the world's too dark to see
Don't give up
