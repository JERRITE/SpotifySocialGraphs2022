Heavenly, that was me
A vision at seventeen
Loves to read, loves to dream
The college of Magdalene

[Pre-Chorus]
You saw a light starting to shine
Wanted it only for your eyes
Older and wise, God on your side
(I paid for your life, I paid for your life)
[Chorus]
I was innocent when you said I was evil
I took your stones and I built a cathedral
Found my peace when I lost my religion
All these years I wished I was different
But, oh, now I know
I'm holy ’til you let me go

[Verse 2]
Tried to pray the pain away
Just like you taught me (But something had changed)
Came to shelter from the blame
But I left taking all the shame

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you saw a light starting to shine
Wanted it only for your eyes
Older and wise, God on your side
(I was the martyr who paid for your life)

[Chorus]
I was innocent when you said I was evil
I took your stones and I built a cathedral
Found my peace when I lost my religion
All these years I wished I was different
But, oh, no, now I know
I'm holy till you let me go

I'm holy till you let me go
I’m holy till you let me go
I'm holy till you let me go
I'm holy till you let me go

[Outro]
They told you that?
That's what was the most shocking to me
Was not that it happened in the first place
But that there was no one looking after you2Embed
