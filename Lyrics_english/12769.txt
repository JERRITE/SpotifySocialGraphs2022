Gypsy Woman LyricsShe smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!

Some come from nowhere
To watch this caravan (gypsy woman)
They come from sunlight to moonlight
To see my gypsy in motion (gypsy woman)
With lips so red you could bite
And hips that sway in the night
That paralyze me with love
She was my gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
She was my gypsy woman (gypsy woman)

Ha! Hey!
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)

She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha-ha!
She smoke pot! Ha!
She smoke pot! Ha-ha!

Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)
Gypsy woman (gypsy woman)

She danced around on the ground
To a guitar melody
And from the fire her face was all aglow
And oh-uh!
How she enchanted me
Woah-Oh!
How I longed to hold her near
And whisper in her ear...
"You are my gypsy woman
You are my gypsy woman""

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
