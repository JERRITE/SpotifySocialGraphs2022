I Saw Her for the First Time LyricsWhen she walked in I held my breath
I thought I might just die
When she came way and she caught my eye
I felt like I could cry

'Cause I never seen a room light up like that
And never felt time stand still
And I didn't know a man could fall so hard
At least not until

I saw her for the first time
And I was longing for the last time
I saw her for the first time
And now I know I gotta make her mine
When she walked in my head did spin
My jaw just hit the ground
Stopped in my tracks like a heart attack
What beauty so profound

'Cause I never seen a room light up like that
And never felt time stand still
And I didn't know a man could fall so fast
At least not until

I saw her for the first time
And I was longing for the last time
I saw her for the first time
And now I know I gotta make her mine

When she walked out I felt no doubt
I would see her again
Up in the clouds and deep in the crowds
Till the very end

'Cause I never seen a face shine light like that
And I never felt so much will
And I didn't know a man could fall so hard
At least not until

I saw her for the first time
And I was longing for the last time
I saw her for the first time
And now I know I gotta make her mineYou might also likeEmbed
