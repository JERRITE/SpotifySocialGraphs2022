Skin Tight Lyrics[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Hope you understand we won't go as planned
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can
I'll still be your friend, you'll come back again
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can

[Verse 1: Steve Lacy, Ravyn Lenae, Steve Lacy & Ravyn Lenae]
Hold me now, skintight
Are you 'round? Come by
Cutie pie, oh, my
Attitude, my type
Who could've thought? It's not black or white
Now every time that I tug, you bite
Ever I call, will you spend the night?
Can't name this "love" if I'm not that nice (Damn)
[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Hope you understand we won't go as planned
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can
I'll still be your friend, you'll come back again
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can

[Verse 2: Ravyn Lenae]
Put your feelings aside (Feelings aside)
Boy, make the drive
You told me, "Just ask"
'Cause you know how I like it
Swallow your pride, won't cover my tracks
I care for you, no one else, baby (No one else, baby)
You deserve someone new
If I can't call you, I won't shake it
Even though you should leave me for good (Damn)

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Hope you understand we won't go as planned
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can
I'll still be your friend, you'll come back again
Hold me while you can, hold me while you can

[Outro: Steve Lacy & Ravyn Lenae]
Skintight (Ah, come back again)
Are you out? Come back (You'll come back again)
Skintight (Ah, come back again)
Are you out? Come back (You'll come back again)You might also like1Embed
