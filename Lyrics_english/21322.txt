Regrets Kill Me LyricsHit her up when I touch down
Hit the plug when I pull up
We just landed in London town
Only here for the night
Those wild nights in Tokyo
I met a girl, she was persian and norwegian
Girl, just give me one reason
Not to miss my flight, I
Think I'm getting high, I
Think I'm falling for you, my
Drug dealing girl
My drug dealing girl
I think I'm falling for you
My drug dealing girl

Popped a pill, copped an ounce
I know what she be about
She ain't really 'bout that smalltalk
Straight to the head, I head to the bed
Flight to Morocco
Cape Town or Toronto bound
Anywhere that you want to go
You already know, nigga be down
My drug dealing girl
I'm in love with your mysterious ways
Got my eyes in a haze
And my heart in a blaze
A fucking mistake, when I'm with you [ah]
But when I'm with you I can't feel my
[Drug dealing girl]
My pain, my pain
[My drug dealing girl]
I'm in love with my
[I think I'm falling for you]
Yeah yeah, yeah you
[My drug dealing girl]
My drug
