TranslationEnglishpusha t - i pray for you ft. Clipse, Labrinth & No Malice (Spanish Translation) Lyrics [lyrics by "Pusha t - i pray for you ft. Labrinth & No Malice (Spanish translation)"] "]

[Enter: Labrinth]
I have prayed for my enemies
I have prayed for my friends
I have prayed that he will not betray me again
I have prayed for the murderers, I have prayed for the saints
Please pray for me now
Because, dear, I have prayed for you
I have prayed for you, mmm
I have prayed for you, mmm
I have prayed for you
Prayed by you (you)
I, you, ooh
[Verse 1: pusha t]
You rarely see the phoenix resurgence from ashes
Lightning hit twice in four classics
Self -preservation, we separate from plastic
The ankle of my sweat is still elastic
I still do gymnastics
If Hov was still young forever
So I am a mortal leap back through these chapters
Land in a soft target
Cook it until you are whitish
They question my score card
Hold it in the light of a torch
I hid it in the porch light
Look, I had a forecast
My 9-1-1 was arriving at Porsche night, ooh
The married drug trafficker even named my son Brixx
He raps of what he lives, so to the devil the babysitter, sit down
Is the adult man in me
Looking for the plug, that's the nomad on me
It is still factor x, that's the rohan in me
Reliably, a model to follow
They drown in too many gold bottles
Harold Melvin without the Blue Note
The last ten years, shouting, "one"
Then take a step back on the duo
The kings of pyrex
I am my brother's guardian, if you listen and dissect him
All I speak is money if you listen to my dialect
Bitch, I shot the grinder in my mother's mother's projects
I'm just being honest with you, how is that for context?
You can live forever when the shit you write is timeless
We are going to live forever, because the shit we write is timeless

Oh
Oh, oh (ooh)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Tell me what I lost
New design and emotions drugs that I don't understand
I know that Hellcats still row when I change
Vietnam's memories, it causes me a snack
The first five of today only strengthen my myth
They belong to Rushmore just for chiseling a brick
They still fight against demons, look, that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me, that's as deep as the abyss, that's no accident
When I was in the mix, I opened your nose as if I were cutting you with some vicks
Enslaving on stoves as if rubbing sticks
I paved another way for my soul to coexist
But only the sky knows it, I will not dug another ditch
With suit and tie, as if you put the ritz
Three discographies agreements showed me that ignorance was happiness
I tried to milked a game that is only two percent
X told you that hell is hot, I told you that you regret
The faith never resigned as he walked along the fence
The faith moves mountains, so what do you face?
Look at my brother around the bitches, I know they pretend
I greet you with the love of God, that does not make us friends
I could whisper to the ear: "enter them all"
Turn on another torchi torch and take it again
Go back over my high horse, they are cars again
Put the ring on your finger again, get old again
[Bridge: Labrinth]
Oh
Oh, Oh (ooh) embed
