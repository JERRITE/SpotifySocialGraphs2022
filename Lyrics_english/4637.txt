My Review Of “Cilvia Demo” by Isaiah Rashad LyricsAlright, so I haven't ever done one of these before, so this is probably going to be a long one. Note that I am writing this as i listen to this album for the first time
So, Isaiah Rashad. Until the 2013 BET Cypher, I had never heard of the guy. I didn't even know anything about him, other than he was a new rapper, signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, which is one of the biggest labels in music right now. I also knew that he was from a small town in Tennessee, Chattanooga. But, I didn't really have anything to judge him off of, than than his cypher performance. And did I like his verse at first? The answer is. well, NO. I didn't really care for his verse at all. But, I, nevertheless was still kinda interested, to say the least, to see what his debut project, "Cilvia", would sound like. So when the album dropped on January 28th, 2014, although I wasn't dying to get a download link, I still wanted to at least give the guy a listen. I mean, he was signed to TDE, so I had to check the dude out
