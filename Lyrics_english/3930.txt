Lucid Dreams Lyrics[Verse]
One more strike and I'm out
I had to figure it out before I lose
Lose me to you
Feeling like I
Got demons to tame (Illusions)
Maybe it's a daze
Got worse over time
I was always high
I had to readjust
I got the feeling I didn't belong there
All alone here
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been here before, ain't no secret
Guilt dealt me tragedy inside-ate me alive
I wanted to die
'Til I realized my real life already left to deal with your broken soul
You need you and I need me, too

[Chorus]
Chasin' sleep (Sleep)
That's where I can see far
Feel you in only one
Lucid dream, lucid dream, abusin' Ambien
Oh, my Lord, I see a car
Used to write our name in car fog
Loving you, more than me
Ambien

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been here before, ain't no secret
Guilt dealt me tragedy inside-ate me alive
I wanted to die
'Til I realized my real life already left to deal with your broken soul
You need you and I need me, too

[Chorus]
Chasin' sleep (Sleep)
That's where I can see far
Feel you in only one
Lucid dream, lucid dream, abusin' Ambien
Oh, my Lord, I see a car
Used to write our name in car fog
Loving you, more than me
