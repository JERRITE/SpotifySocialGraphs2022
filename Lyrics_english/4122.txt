[Intro]
Lu-Lu-Lunay

[Pre-car]
What do you want and fuck, hesitate
Solita pa 'break the album
What what does e 'fuck, hesitate (chi, chi, chi)
Give it down, Pata 'down without stopping
[Chorus]
And being single is fashionable
That's why she doesn't fall in love
Being single is fashionable
That's why he will not change (she will not change)
Being single is fashionable
That's why she doesn't fall in love (Rra-Rra!)
-Tar single is fashionable (She)
That's why he is not going to cam-chart

[Verse 1]
That nobody claims
Celu 'in plane mode, does not want them to call her
It doesn't matter if they want it or love it
Hesitate and fuck, that's his planet '

[Bridge]
And for now that will not change
Zero commitment ', he just wants to be beautiful
Because he doesn't want anyone to fail him again
Drink and fuck, it's not going to tie
And for now that will not change
Zero commitment ', he just wants to be beautiful
Because he doesn't want anyone to fail him again
Drink and fuck, it's not going to tie

[Verse 2]
Ponte-Ponte for the return, that I am going to party
If not, we veem ', mommy, in the After Party
Ponte pa'l problem, go, let yourself see
What started 'killing it' in the motel
You are loose out there, I am loose here
Make you wiki wiki, as Yaviah says
He released his heart, he took the cursa for a walk '
Has a damage 'mind'
There is no one who loves her
Smoke and leaves in a trance
Perreando does not lose the balance
To'as throw him and are not available
In romance I don't think she progresses, Yeah
[Bridge]
And for now that will not change
Zero commitment ', he just wants to be beautiful
Because he doesn't want anyone to fail him again
Drink and fuck, it's not going to tie
