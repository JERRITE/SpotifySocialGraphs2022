RED Lyrics[Intro]
Bloodhounds
GoonnCity and you can't get in
NOVAGANG
Nice job, Team
SLOWSILVER03

[Verse 1: Chach]
Flying way too low, nowhere else to go
Far away from home (See you in my scope)
Girl white like coke, cold white, no snow
Let the pack burn slow, I can feel it in my bones
Cut my vein, bleeding red, bloodied up my bed
I done lost my mind, geeking off the meds
This ain't what I wanted, give 'em what they want instead
I don't wanna talk now, it's a total lockdown
Bitch, who let the dogs out?
SLOWSILVER, Bloodhounds
Sleep through the night, hold me tight, give me love now
Wido pass it back, and I catch it yelling "Touchdown!"
[Verse 2: Wido]
Papers, rolling papers
Rolling loud on my sweater
You're a creep, you just chase her (SLOWSILVER03)
Put that fucker's head inside the basement
It seems like the cool guys are the special ones
Never backspace my life, I care 'bout everyone
I say it every month, but never keep it up
I always put some fuckin' work in just to give it up

[Verse 3: osquinn]
They asked if I care, but I don't care at all
Wanna put my fist inside this fuckin' wall
Don't got a lot of time, my patience really small
You can catch me, two AM, walking 'round the mall
And you can kill me if you want to
And if you hate me, then it's fuck you
It isn't like I ever knew you
I'd rather die than fucking trust you
'Cause all my days, they have been minimized
I'm almost certain that I'm gonna die
I live my life like I'm not civilized
Can't live in peace, I'm always criticized

[Verse 4: Dolly]
How could you honestly tell me I'm not your fucking prize?
I'd rather burn my fucking skin and bleach my fucking eyes
You never really felt the same, but can I be surprised?
And it would really make your day if I just tell my lies?
And really lately, I forgot my fuckin' purpose
And you would like it I sped up and I swerved it
And you would like it if I flipped off of this fuckin' bridge
And I don't wanna live, and that's just how it is
You might also like[Verse 5: Midwxst]
Screaming Nova-Hound, getting hard to breathe
I can't seem to find you, no, I cannot see
Bleeding on designer, bleeding on my tee
Lying at your face, so you're dead to me
Got no plan, got nowhere to run
Walkin' outside, staring at the sun
Lost all my joy, nothing ever fun
No one to talk to, not anyone

[Verse 6: Kurtains]
Don't look at me, I'll make you bleed
I don't wanna know all the shit that they say 'bout me
Talkin' hella fun, I'll make you screa— uh
Red, red, red, all over the fuckin' clothes
Put, lead, lead, lead, all over your fuckin' throat (Chkk)
I'm bleeding out, please help me (No, shut up)
They talk so much, but damn they crushed
Me and Wido on your block, came with a Glock, taking his ass
Ten racks, and I'll never go back
Hunnid', hunnid', put 'em all in the pack
Can't fuck with me, I got tricks up my sleeve
Glock with a beam, Mommworld, that's my team
SLOWSILVER, I'm with Wido, I'm with Quinn, I'm with Glaive
Talkin' bout some real red, red, okay
That's all they gonna fuckin' see
When I hit 'em with that beam
Then I throw 'em in the stream
[Verse 7: Glaive]
Hi, what's up?
Lately I've been fucked up, I've been high and drunk
My therapist told me that I should lighten up
My family doesn't trust me 'cause I lie too well
And like all these fuckin' problems, they've been piling up
Yeah, my phone on Do-Not-Disturb
Swear if you keep texting me them problems, you gon' get to us
My stats keep on getting better, your stats keep on getting worse
And all I do is dub these hoes, 'cause I know that you're fuckin' us

[Verse 8: blackwinterwells]
I'd rather die than I'd spend one moment with you
Bitch, I've had enough running 'round in circles, fuck you
Lately feelin' wired, powder tearing up my nose too
Wellsy lost her mind, Russian Roulette in the bathroom
Flex on your bitch, serpent wrapped around my wrist
I'm the messenger, I'm here to tell you you ain't really shit
This that Goonn and Nova tip, and you can't ever get in
Givin' up on all these rodents, rather glow up with my clique, yuh

[Verse 9: Braxton Knight]
Way out my element, I'm so lost
I gotta keep it together at all costs
Point it to my head, you got one shot
But I'ma haunt you forever, like Sephiroth
Posted with my team, we was running through them catacombs
Oh no, you scared, home alone
We pullin' up, you better get gone
My vision all red, the rage overflows
My heart turning black, my soul is hollow
All this pain, I can't let it go
Do me wrong, you better go rogue, yeah
I see all red in the night time
Lurking all through midnight, infrared is my sight
When we're all dead, would you be kind?
Put this quote up online, I'm not okay, and that's fine

[Verse 10: Zootzie]
I was damaged and you ain't give a shit (Fuck)
Bitch, I'm on the floor, I'm trembling
Thinking how she don't love me, can't get it through my thick head
Thinking I could find real love, fuck was I thinking?
She said, "Zootzie, you're my hero"
I said, "Nah bitch, I'm not a hero"
That boy talkin' tough, turn him to a zero
Those girls are not into you, you just a weirdo (Ah)

[Verse 11: Kite]
It gets boring, It gets boring
I don't know what to do
It feels like I've been walking, for days longing
Feels like I'm crawling, it's been so quiet
In my thoughts, I get it, louder than ever
Walking, flocking, through at night, it's been forever

[Verse 12: Kuru]
Yeah, I'm emptying a clip on your homies
She wanna hit me up, but I don't really think she know me
Think that you're one of us, but really, you're a phony
Yeah, I ain't fucking with a dumbass, no bologna
Yeah, I'm aiming the beam at your face, yeah we go in, we might pop off
Yeah, yeah, you bitches be pussy
All your bullshit, gettin' my Glock off
Yeah, I got a roller-coaster in my head, and I think I might just drop off
Yeah, I'm smokin' on crack pack and I think I might just nod off

[Verse 13: Misaku Foxx]
It's not important, let's not talk about it
Convinced myself that I can live without it
But it's nothing but illusions (Illusions, illusions)
Crazy, always jumping to conclusions
Aye, wait a minute, bitch, I'm posted with my bros
I make the pack disappear, where'd it go? (Go, go)
Bitch I came into the function with my strap, I'm on go
I am dressed in all black, head to toe, like a crow

[Verse 14: Saturn]
I'ma drive a Double-Decker Bus, ridin' to the sun
To die by your side, oh, I spit on your grave fuckin' twice
You let your girlfriend fight your fights, I'm not surprised
I got thirty in the ice tray, I could never lie
Now she grabbin' on my jacket, she telling me she shy
I know she cap, I saw her with another guy
I was never nice, I know I'm an asshole, it's your fault
Ten toes on the ground in the asphalt
Waiting for Titanfall, I had to sit on the bleachers, wasn't my time to ball
And when I try to make a song, I always slip and fall
It's not my fault that I don't know none of this shit at all
I guess it's time to fix my body with the medical
Loss of time and seeing no drops, I couldn't be upset at all

[Outro]
Fetch me their souls!13Embed
