Now We Lay â€™Em Down Lyrics[Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Eastside, Long Beach drop the hizammer
We got, so many niggas on the team nowadays
LB, QB, DPGC
Boy, my boys, the toys, the noise
Them Eastside boys is the real McCoys
We walkin through the projects sippin on a 40
Rippin, dippin, and spittin at your shorty
You may think I'm outta bounds but I think I'm in
I holla at my folks before I check on in
Spit at my nigga Andy Hilfiger
Slide up in the garden, next to Steve Martin
We settin up shop on the East Coast now
Dogghouse nigga, the big bow wow
And we higher than a motherfucker, East Side up
It's like this and like that motherfucker
Eastside
So wide you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it, now
So high you can't get over it
I just want to make your day

[Goldie Loc]
Wakin up late off a fucked up day
I was Henn Dogg sippin, straight Dogg House crippin
Fuck wit us and get that ass bombed out
Save some smoke, for the homies from the south
This is what it's all about
It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang
Sag wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs
Swerve through the eastside Loc, scoop up the homies
Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me
It seems like this is my only chance to get rich
Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch
Trip, bring that bomb to me
Underwater with Kokane, crackin with P O P
Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong
I'm faded like Cheech and Chong
Watch out for the second hand smoke

[Tray Deee]
Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah
Represented mines to be a true Eastsida
Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit
Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips
No restrictions, takin off as soon as friction
Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in
Pimp brim, khaki suit and Stacy biscuits
And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches
Keep em workin somethin everywhere we go
Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe
West coast to the fullest but I bang the East
Mad muthafuccin' side of that city Long Beach
So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up
And oh fo sho I'm bouta throw the Eastside up!
And if a nigga got beef with that
That's where his ass'll be sleepin at
