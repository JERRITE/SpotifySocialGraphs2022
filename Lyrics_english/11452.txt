Lullabye Lyrics[Chorus]
Honey is for bees, silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter how you feel
Life is just a ferris wheel
It's always up and down
Don't make a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around

[Verse 2]
It's just the sweet weather and the peacock feathers
In the morning it will all be better
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around

[Chorus]
Honey is for bees, silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleepYou might also like5Embed
