Not Right Lyrics[Intro]
Murda on the Beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
Ayy, Murda on the Beat so it's not nice (Uh)
Try to flex the foreigns know your mans tight (Uh)
If you talking hell, we wipe you, wet wipes
Pull up Drippy to the scene then it's night, night
Aye, Murda on the Beat so it's not nice
Run up to your block, to your block, call it Bike Life
Free my nigga Meek, nigga Meek, that was not right
Rollie on my wrist, on my wrist, and it bite, bite
[Verse]
If you don't know 'bout Margielaa man, you better pay attention
I just tried to school you lil' niggas but y'all got detention
I was jumping fences since eleven, now I'm in a mansion
Rockin' dirty clothes, now I'm on and my diamonds dancing
Ayy, shit is getting cold, shit is getting cold (Ayy)
I might put like fifty thousand for a coat (Ayy)
Rockin' presidentials, I can't even vote (Aye)
Skrrt up in them jet skis, we don't do them boats (Ayy)
I don't take flights, I don't take flights (Ayy)
Hop in the jet, boy I'm livin' life (Ayy)
Heard you wanna fight, heard you wanna fight (Ayy)
You a lame boy get your shit right (Ayy)
Smooky on the beat, it's about time
Money on my mind, on my mind
'Member sellin' candy, sellin' dimes
Now I ball up a nigga sang my lines

[Chorus]
Murda on the Beat so it's not nice (Uh)
Try to flex the foreigns know your mans tight (Uh)
If you talking hell, we wack you, wet wipes
Pull up Drippy to the scene then it's night night
Ayy, Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Run up to your block, to your block, call it Bike Life
Free my nigga Meek, nigga Meek, that was not right
Rollie on my wrist, on my wrist, and it bite, bite

Ayy, shit is getting cold, shit is getting cold (Ayy)
I might put like fifty thousand for a coat (Ayy)
Rocking presidentials, I can't even vote (Aye)
Scatter up on them jet skis, we don't do them boats (Ayy)2Embed
