Translationenglishboslen feat. Tyla yaweh - deny (Turkish translation) lyrics [Nakarat: Boslen]
You were in my dream last night, we're in now
I'm fine, I won't lie, I miss him
I kept you not to lose between the smoke
We would pray to hope but we lost control
How can I do wrong? You were running, I was alone
Now that I am alone, I can overcome it, I will do my best
I don't refuse, I don't refuse
Oh, I'll be at peace with my life
Oh, I'll get better at the expense of my life
I don't refuse, I don't refuse
Oh, I will improve at the expense of my life
[Verse 1: Boslen]
I want everything but I have a lot of sh–µy in my mind
I thought I left him at home but after night
I could give you the world, we would take the place to us and catch up on the plane
I took you to Saint Laurent, take whatever is suitable for your body
But I guess I just pay this price while on the roads
You can see me on a radio or a show program
This is the life I always desire, my wrists seem like snow
Luxury life in SUV, we can never stay poor

[Nakarat: Boslen]
You were in my dream last night, we're in now
I'm fine, I won't lie, I miss him
I kept you not to lose between the smoke
We would pray to hope but we lost control
How can I do wrong? You were running, I was alone
Now that I am alone, I can overcome it, I will do my best
I don't refuse, I don't refuse
Oh, I'll be at peace with my life
Oh, I'll get better at the expense of my life
I don't refuse, I don't refuse
Oh, I'll get better at the expense of my life

[Verse 2: Tyla yweh]
I was waiting for that phone to play all night
I missed two flights, I was mandatory for night flights
I lost hope every night because I knew it wasn't determined
Why do you have to lie now?
Close my eyes, I'm blind now
I do not want to talk
I don't want to walk
I don't want to be involved

I don't refuse, I don't refuse

Oh, I'll get better at the expense of my life
I don't refuse, I don't refuse
