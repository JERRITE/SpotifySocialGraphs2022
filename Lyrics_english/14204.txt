Picture Me In Hospital Lyrics[Verse 1]
Picture me in a hospital
The blood runs red and the bags are full of...
Oh it's terrible, makes me powerful
On and on there's still a song for me
I'm still around to sing it

[Chorus 1]
Each man has a secret
To hide away
And never say, never know, and so it goes
[Verse 2]
Picture me in a hospital
The blood runs cold and hall are full of
Undesirables preaching parables
False alarm, there's still a charm for me
Just you wait and see

[Chorus 2]
If each man had his freedom
And it was ours to say
How to behave, oh who's to say

[Verse 3]
So picture me in a hospital
Blood runs raw and the bags are full of-
You're terrible and I'm invincible
Picture me in a hospital
The blood runs red and the bags are full of-
It's hysterical, and it makes me powerful

[Chorus 3]
False alarm there's still a song for me
I'm just about around to sing it
There's still a chance for me
And I'm still here singing
You might also like[Outro]
And so it goes
On and on and on and so it goes
And so it goes1Embed
