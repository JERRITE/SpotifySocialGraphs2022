Closer to the Sun LyricsIf I think she beautiful, well that's for sure
Give a little loving, but I still gonna need some more, rob it
Stealing from the rich and then give it to the poor
Telling everybody it don't matter anymore, she said
All I really needed was a friend like you
Help me through and together we can change, but
If I was to stay, it wasn't for too long
People sing the same song, everywhere I'm going
Closer to the sun and far from the moon
People screaming out they gonna see me real soon
They say oooohhh, ooohhhhh, ooohhhh,ooooohhh
If I think she beautiful, well that's for sure
Give a little loving, but I still gonna need some more, rob it
Stealing from the rich and then give it to the poor
Telling everybody it don't matter anymore, said
All I really needed was a friend like you
Help me through and together we can change, but
If I was to stay it wasn't for too long
People sing the same song everywhere I'm goin'
Closer to the sun and far from the moon
People screaming out they gonna see me real soon
They say oooohhh, ooohhhhh, ooohhhh,ooooohhhYou might also like3Embed
