[Intro: Milly]
Oh oh

OH-OH-WOH, OH-OH-OH
Baby, I know
This is the remix (EH)

[Saying: threat, Jay Wheeler & Millly]
No, no, I'm not pa 'you, I don't want to hurt you
We can 'see ourselves' a couple of times'
And no more from there, no more from there
And you don't ere 'mine, I'm not yours either
Everything stays in bed
To love I flee
[Chorus: Nio García, Milly & Farruko]
I don't fall in love with me '
I don't believe in Amore '(EH)
I know I lost myself after eating you
Now picheo pa 'see you again
I don't fall in love with me '
I changed flowers 'for condoms'
I know what I lost after I eat you (eat you)
Now picheo pa 'see you again (Farru!)

[Verse 1: Farruko & Jay Wheeler]
I warned you the first to see '(Blep!)
That this was to see and from time to time '
That was not for you to go 'in feeling
But you wrapped yourself, bad yours, sorry
You know 'I'm a pitcher
I'm out there to Switche
Do not say 'I did something
If I know that you are 'crazy because again I step on you
And I'm not for relating '(Yeah)
Nor to give explanations (Yeah)
Men 'to control me
I am not the husband of yours, I am the one who puts it to you
PRI-YAH-YAH, Farru! (Jay Wheeler)

[Verse 2: Jay Wheeler]
I told you that it was a dust, for love I'm deaf
Once I tried, but I can't stand that love
I don't deny it, I like to eat you
In to'a they position them 'to put on
And although it was a pleasure to meet you
Chingamo 'and I don't want to see you (Yeah-Yeah)
You don't ere 'mine, I'm not yours either
Everything stays in bed, love I flee (Yeah-Yeah)
And you don't ere 'mine, I'm not yours either
Everything stays in bed (Yeah), love I flee

I do not believe in any of that, or in a world of color '
Mor mine, I'm sorry, I have my reason '
You excited yourself, but me without a cojone '
I don't think about you, I don't get excited '(ah)
Tell Cupid that I am vacationing '
Don't keep behind me, I'm not going to lie to you (ah, ey; ah-ah)
And 'very difficult for me to fall in love (fall in love)

Bad mine with my caresses I confused you

[Verse 5: Milly]
Milly, Milly
Baby, bad mine for picharte, I know you wrapped yourself
If I treat you apart, I really swear, I wouldn't love you
It was only the lip to be able to give you
Mommy, I was sincere
I don't love you anymore, this is passenger
I'm just put for money
I don't fall in love, I'm a leather
They failed me once and now that's why I suffer from
I just want a crazy night
With women who place it
Zero love, I'm in my note

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler & Millly]
I don't fall in love with me '
I don't believe in Amore '
I know that I missed I eat 'to eat you
Now picheo pa 'see you again
I don't fall in love with me '
I changed 'for condoms' flowers (EH)
I know that I missed I eat 'to eat you (huh)
Now picheo pa 'see you again
