Báilame Lyrics [lyrics by "Báilame"]

[Intro]
UOH-UOH
Yeah-Yeah
The creature, baby

[Bridge]
The movement at your waist is magical
As I would like to have it in intimate
I feel a fan of your hips
This desire is already in critical condition
In my intention there are tacit objectives
In madness an implicit feeling
With the looks to understand it is practical
I want to get wet with your mystical lips
[Pre-car]
With your figure that catches me-Atrapa
With that 'curve' that kill me
A look that attacks me-Ataca
And a desire that apron me (oh-oh)
With your figure that catches me-Atrapa
With that 'curve' that kill me
A look that attacks me-Ataca
And a desire that apron me (oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Báilame, Yeah, Yeah
With that mouth Kissame (EH)
With that body Arropame
With your hands feel me
Báilame, Yeah, Yeah
With a kiss Mojame (EH)
With your waist I will
With that swing atráme (attrame)

[Verse 1]
The desire uploads, you dancing, seducing me
Imagine that our body 'are feeling
To the rhythm of music, playing and getting to know each other
Dancing, merging, in fire they are getting (oh-oh)
I want to dance with you this song
With volume to the maximum (volume to the maximum)
And sanity in the minimum (sanity at the minimum)

A look that attacks me-Ataca

In my intention there are tacit objectives
In madness an implicit feeling
With the looks to understand it is practical
I want to get wet with your mystical lips

With that 'curve' that kill me (kill)
A look that attacks me-Ataca (OH-OH)
And a desire that apron me (oh-oh)
With your figure that catches me-Atrapa (catch)
With that 'curve' that kill me (kill)
A look that attacks me-Ataca (OH-OH)
And a desire that apron me (oh-oh)

[Chorus]

With your waist I will (your waist that causes)
With that swing atráme (attrame)
