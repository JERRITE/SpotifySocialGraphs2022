Calling Card LyricsI am a new class of evil, a cynic, a thief
A criminal with no sympathy
I will smile my insidious smile
My anarchist living dream

I am an agent, an agent of chaos
I am a force, a force of nature
I will smile my insidious smile
Live just to watch it all burn
No plan, no code, no reason why
I relieve you of the burden
Of your failed and useless lives
As your world crumbles
Your failed and useless lives are fucking done

My chaos spreads faster than a virus running from its cure
I will smile my insidious smile
I'm as infectious as the next
Welcome the sickness
And fall in love with it

I relieve you of the burden
Of your failed and useless lives
As your world crumbles
Your failed and useless lives are fucking done

I will carve a smile into this pathetic world
I will carve a smile into this pathetic world

All it takes is one bad day
To deliver a man to lunacy
And today is that day
Today is that day

I will carve a smile into this pathetic world
With my insidious smile
I will carve a smile into this pathetic world
With my insidious smileYou might also likeEmbed
