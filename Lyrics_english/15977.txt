This Time Last Year Lyrics[Verse 1]
This time last year
There was a twinkle in your eye
When you stared into the fire was a love affair
But that was then, this time last year

[Verse 2]
This time last year
We raised our glasses to the night, oh, I
Was your family and you were mine
But that was then, this time last year
[Chorus]
But this time this year
I'm running circles 'round the thoughts of you, my dear
I should've realised the end was drawing near
We acted out of fear, see
Well, now it's over

[Verse 3]
This time last year
While the amber lights were shining so bright
I held a hope that we would be alright
But that was then this time last year

[Outro]
This time last year
I thought I knew everythingYou might also like5Embed
