Your body snatches me (remix) lyrics [intro: j-king & perquito]
I invite you to leave tonight, let's come
Babsita already ...
I want to fill my mouth with your smell of Dolce
I'm going to taste you
Your body is my sativa cannabis
That puts my thoughtful mind
I use you how to use a cohíba
I give you and fill you with life
(Welcome to the remix)
[Choir: Periquito, J King & J Alvarez]
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body has me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MA
Your body Vuеlve crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body has me crazy

[Verse 1: jowell]
That's you right the sour diesel, haze, kush for you
I don't know if you realized that your body snatches me
Is that you make so many positions that you kill me
Can not be
I am all day in a cloud all day woman
Thought of you, what I'm going to do
From noon, afternoon, night and tomorrow
If you want the next day, come back and flame
You know that I am for you, and your slope
And I in the pigera, dance hot as like
Forget about him and come with which he does not fail
After the line, we left for Guaya Guaya

[Verse 2: Franco El Gorilla]
Your body is my sacred temple and that is a minimum example
What do you understand why I walk when I contemplate you
You have the vitamin, the look that energizes
And the ability to melt with your smile
You have a boom boom that kills and Sata's face
You're going to make your deceased husband pull my legs
While I sleep, because you have me sick
And the red head doll like Elmo
Your body tonight will be mine
Your drunk and I ignite
Your body in the cold giving me heat
You and I wrapped in sweat

YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body has me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body (to me) is crazy about
Your body mai snows me, it has me crazy
Your body mai snows me, it has me crazy

[Verse 3: Maximan]
You follow up moving that you have bad
Keep with the trip that has me high
You have what puts me to hesitate
Don't be shy, abuser
Break the floor and fuck
Get to me that with you I go to all
I'm going to make you a story that is not delay
That I feel I revolved
I feel that I explode if you touch me

[Bridge: Periquito, D.Ozi & Jowell]
Ohh oh oh oh ...
Your body takes me baby
Ohh oh oh oh ...
And I want to do it again and again
Ohh oh oh oh ... (Tell him Jowell)
Is that your body snatches me baby
Ohh oh oh oh ...
And I want to do it again and again
[Choir: Periquito, J King & J Alvarez]
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body has me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy

[Verse 4: j alvarez & d.ozi]
Yes mom...
Without my fear, get on me
Don't be injured by me back
Your body has me wrong
I hit the wall and wrapped you
While the note keeps going up
You will see how I turn on you
Is that your body takes me (the serum)

[Verse 5: D.OZI]
Dangerous substance
The most beautiful flower in my garden
With you I wear wives
If you are an agent, I don't care about people
Although I like the street I am a decent man
Toy put for you
I want you to be
I just want a little of your body and feel
That everyone looks but nobody touches
I kiss your mouth and discover every point that makes you crazy
Your body snatches me like Krippy in leaf
The culprit of your note
A hard devil, but in the end I loosen

[Verse 6: Periquito]
You and your body that snatch me and wrapped me
Follow baby, keep turning on
Take a sensual note, you don't want to finish
I want to do so many things
To which the note lasts
Your body causes me
Your body has me so crazy
I lose control
I want to do so many things
To which the note lasts
Your body causes me
Your body has me so crazy
I lose control

[Bridge: Periquito, J Alvarez, D.Ozi & Jowell]
Ohh oh oh oh ...
Your body takes me baby
Ohh oh oh oh ...
And I want to do it again and again
Ohh oh oh oh ...
Your body takes me baby
Ohh oh oh oh ...
And I want to do it again and again

[Verse 7: Periquito]
I take it to the album and do it (tra!)
I take it in the car and do it (tra!)
Wherever I get the vo'a do (tra!)
I take it with dj joe and vo'a do (tra!)
I take it to the album and do it (tra!)
I take it in the car and do it (tra!)
Wherever the Pille will vo'a to do (tra!)
I take it with dj joe and vo'a do (tra!)

[Choir: Periquito, J King & J Alvarez]
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME

YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body makes me crazy
YOUR BODY MAI MAKES ME
Your body has me crazy
