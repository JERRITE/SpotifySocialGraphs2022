TranslationsDeutschWondering Lyrics[Verse 1: Julia Lester]
Seems like a part of me will always have to lose
Every single time I have to choose
Swore that it felt right, but was I wrong?
Is this where I'm supposed to be at all?
I don’t have the answers, not today
It's like nothing makes the questions go away
What I'd give to see if the grass was greener

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Lester]
On the other side of all I’ve had and lost
Would it be enough or would I still be wondering?
[Chorus: Julia Lester]
If I could go back and change the past
Be a little braver than I had
And bet against the odds
Would I still be lost?
Even if I woke up in my dreams
Would there still be something I'm missing?
If I had everything, would it mean anything to me?
Ooh

[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo]
Feels like I might have broke the best thing that I had
I said too much to ever take it back
Scared I'll never find something as good
And would I even know it if I could?

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, Julia Lester, Both]
On the other side of all I've had and lost
Would it be enough or would I still be wondering?
(Or would I still be wondering, oh)

[Chorus: Julia Lester & Olivia Rodrigo]
If I could go back and change the past
Be a little braver than I had
And bet against the odds
Would I still be lost?
Even if I woke up in my dreams
Would there still be something I'm missing?
If I had everything, would it mean anything?

Maybe I should turn around and take the other road
Or maybe I'm just lookin' for what I already know
I'm just wondering

[Chorus: Julia Lester, Both]
If I could go back and change the past
Be a little braver than I had
And bet against the odds
Would I still be lost?
Even if I woke up in my dreams
Would there still be something I’m missing?
If I had everything, would it mean anything to me?

[Outro: Julia Lester]
Would it be enough
Or would I still be wondering?15Embed
