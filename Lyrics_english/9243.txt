Tobacco Street (Tobacco Road) Lyricsyo I was born, on the ground 
 Mom died, Dad got drunk 
 In the middle of the street he abandoned me 
 Love and only on tobacco street 

 I grew up, in a hut 
 I didn't have my poor clothes 
 Just you know how much I 
 I fear tobacco street 

 But it's my land 
 The only one I know 
 You know? how much I 
 Tobacco street 
 I already march, to work 
 If heaven wants to help me 
 To join money and old 
 I will return to tobacco street 

 But it's my land 
 The only one I know 
 You know? how much I 
 Tobacco street 

 Against the world, I would like 
 Collapse 
 Build a decent town 
 And give it the name of Tabacoyou Might Also Likeembed Street
