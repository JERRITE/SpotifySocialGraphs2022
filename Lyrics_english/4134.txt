If you tell me that Lyrics [letter of "if you tell me yes"]

[Intro: Farruko]
Laramercy Gang
For You, My Love

[Verse 1: Reik & Farruko]
What if I told you
That I have not forgotten you, that I did not learn to live without you? (Reik)
What happens if tonight
Do we play the past to cure the scar? (Camilo)
[Pre-Caro: Reik & Farruko]
What would not give to kiss your neck?
What wouldn't give your hair to smell
While you fall asleep in my chest?
I would give everything to return time (Farru!)

[Chorus: Reik, Farruko, Camilo & Reik]
It is so
If I don't have your kiss', I can die (uah-yoh, uah-yeh)
If you move away from me, I don't want to live
If from afar it shows that you are no longer happy (Blep!)
I leave everything for you if you tell me yes

[Saying: Reik, Camilo, Farruko, Reik & Camilo]
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (Larame like)
If you tell me yes
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (Farru!)
If you tell me yes

[Verse 2: Camilo & Reik, both]
Your mouth remembers me if I touch it
My mind does not forget and my body either
You taught me to love you (love you)
But never forget
Tell me what I'm going to do for you to stay here (huh; tell what I do)
If it's not you, it's nobody (Woh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh)
You Might Also Like [Choir: Camilo & Reik, both]
And so (that's)
If I don't have your kisses, I can die (if you are not I die)
If you move away from me, I don't want to live (I don't want anymore)
If from afar it shows that you are no longer happy
I leave everything for you if you tell me yes (oh, oh, mmm)

[Saying: Reik, Camilo, Farruko, Reik & Camilo]
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah; Larame like gang)
If you tell me yes
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (Farru!; Oh, oh)
If you tell me yes (PRI-YAH, YAH)

[Verse 3: Farruko]
If you tell me that I do buy you Richard Mille (Blep!)
I give you a house there in Beverly Hilli (Yah-Yah)
Pa 'live' the Movie Flowi and Meek Milli
Like the series of El Patron, Somo 'El Topo and El Chili (Plo!)
Inseparable, passionate accomplices in pleasure
If you will convince you to come back again
And tell me no, throw me a camouflaged "yes"
Cond a question and I will stay by your side

[Pre-car: Farruko]
What wouldn't give your hair to smell
While you fall asleep in my chest?
I would give everything to return time (Farru!)
[Choir: Farruko & Reik, Camilo & Farruko]
And it is so
If I don't have your kisses I can die (uah-yo, uah-yeh)
If you move away from me, I don't want to live
If from afar it shows that you are no longer happy (Blep!)
I leave everything for you if you tell me yes

[Saying: Reik, Camilo & Farruko]
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (if you tell me yes; Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah-Yeah)
If you tell me yes (Farru!)
Who you are cheating? You are not happy without me (Blep!)
If you tell me yes

[Outro: Reik]
What would not give to kiss your neck?
What wouldn't give your hair to smell
While you fall asleep in my chest?
Would give everything to return the time2embed
