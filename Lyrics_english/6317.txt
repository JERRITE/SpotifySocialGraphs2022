Walk Through the Fire Lyrics[Verse 1: Zayde Wølf & Ruelle]
I'm always wondering
If it's ever gonna end
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it in my bones
Standing in the dust
Of what's left of us
I can see you in my soul
I can see you in my soul

[Pre-Chorus: Zayde Wølf & Ruelle]
Did we take too many chances?
Did we let too many pass us?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we light too many matches?
Turn ourselves into these ashes?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
[Chorus: Zayde Wølf & Ruelle]
We walk through the fire
Is there a way out?
Is there a way out?
We walk through the fire
Is there a way out?
Is there a way out?

[Verse 2: Ruelle & Zayde Wølf]
I try to understand
How we're here again
In the middle of the storm
In the middle of the storm
There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
But straight through the smoke
Straight through the smoke
And the fight is all we know
The fight is all we know

[Pre-Chorus: Zayde Wølf & Ruelle]
Did we take too many chances?
Did we let too many pass us?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we light too many matches?
Turn ourselves into these ashes?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?

We walk through the fire
Is there a way out?
Is there a way out?
We walk through the fire
Is there a way out?
Is there a way out?
Of the fire

[Breakdown: Zayde Wølf]
I wanna know, is there a way out?
Hey, yeah
Is there a way out?
Yeah, yeah
Show me a way out
Is there a way out?

[Outro: Ruelle]
We walk through the fire
Is there a way out?
Is there a way out?1Embed
