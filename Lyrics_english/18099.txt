TranslationsPortuguêsItalianoDeutschNessa Barrett - i hope ur miserable until ur dead (Traduction Française)​i hope ur miserable until ur dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
I still hear your voice, tryna rip my world to pieces
But I'm not your toy, you can break and leave there bleeding
The damage is done, moving on if I'm ready or not
But you drag me through mud, here I come, now I'm petty as fuck
(I'm petty as fuck)

[Chorus]
I hope you never fall in love again
I hope you be yourself and lose your friends
I hope they call you out for shit you said
I hope you're miserable until you're dead
[Post-Chorus]
I hope you're miserable
So fucking miserable
I hopе you're miserable
I hopе you're miserable until you're dead

[Verse 2]
Been keeping your shit to myself
If I said it out loud, you'd be burning in Hell
And I can make everybody hate you
Almost as much as you hate yourself
But I won't 'cause (I won't), I know (I know)
One day it'll come around, but fuck you for now

[Chorus]
I hope you never fall in love again
I hope you be yourself and lose your friends (Lose your friends)
I hope they call you out for shit you said (You said)
I hope you're miserable until you're dead

[Bridge]
The damage is done, moving on if I'm ready or not
But you drag me through mud, here I come, now I'm petty as fuck
(I'm petty as fuck)

[Chorus]
I hope you never fall in love again
I hope you be yourself and lose your friends
I hope they call you out for shit you said (You said)
I hope you're miserable until you're dead
I hope you're haunted by all your regrets
I hope they fuck you up inside your head
You know I don't forgive, I don't forget
I hope you're miserable until you're dead
You might also like[Outro]
I hope you never fall in love again
I hope you be yourself and lose your friends
I hope they call you out for shit you said
I hope you're miserable until you're dead10Embed
