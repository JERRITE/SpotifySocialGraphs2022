F*ck Me & Feed Me LyricsHe said,"Hey there, Bonita
I've been waiting for a chance to say the ways I love you so
Can I get underneath you?"
Boy, you're kinda crazy
So I said, "Fuck me then feed me
And I'll be your diamond
If you never leave me
Yeah, I'll keep your skyward
And I won't be crazy
No, I'll keep you grounded
And if you want it, baby
Just get yourself around it now"
Fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And I won't be cr-crazy
No, I'll keep you gr-grounded
And you want it, b-baby
Just get yourself around it now
I'll never be like the girls you had before me
'Cause you've got a good thing going
And I know you'll adore me
And he said,"Maybe I'll keep ya
On the low for times when I feel like wasting time alone and
Maybe, maybe I'll please ya...
Or get kind of crazy"
Then he said,"Fuck me and feed me
And I'll be your diamond
If you never leave me
Girl, then I'll keep on trying
You can get crazy
'Cause you keep me grounded
So, if you want it, baby
Then get yourself around here now
Fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And I won't be cr-crazy
No, I'll keep you gr-grounded
And you want it, b-baby
Just get yourself around-round
Fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And fuck-fuck then feed me
And I won't be cr-crazy
No, I'll keep you gr-grounded
And you want it, b-baby
Just get yourself around here now
