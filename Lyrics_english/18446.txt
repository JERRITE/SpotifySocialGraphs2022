Bipolar, Baby! Lyrics[Verse 1]
She self-medicates
She cries and make her lies seem more sincere
When she's out of line
She's always right, got her own best interest in mind
She's a bad girl, always outta line

She's kind, at times
She's the first to pick a fight
And convinced that she's always right
She's up and down, and in and out of this world
She's always out of line, always out of line
[Chorus]
She drives me crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby, one of a kind
She'll break your heart like she broke mine
Bipolar baby, make up your mind
Make up your mind

[Verse 2]
She's a waste of time
She'll leave you high and dry
She curses and kisses and talks while she listens
She's a bad girl, always out of line
She's a bad girl, always out of line
Always out of line

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby, one of a kind
She'll break your heart like she broke mine
Bipolar baby, make up your mind
Make up your mind

[Bridge]
Time's slipping away, gotta pick up the pace
Like she's running a race and I'm left behind
Is she worth the chase? Should I let her go?
If she comes in close, will she hear me say slow down?

She drives me crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby, one of a kind
She'll break your heart like she broke mine
Bipolar baby, make up your mind

She'll drive you crazy, all of the time
Bipolar baby, one of a kind
She'll break your heart like she broke mine
Bipolar baby, make up your mind
Make up your mind2Embed
