The God That Never Was LyricsAwakening from ancient slumber
Shadows lingering cursing my dreams
Leaving the remaining of godly-hood behind
I made churches burn
With congregations still inside
Lord almighty preying on mankind

I am God I taste of blood
In the grip of a bitter loss
Divine thing that should not be
The god that never was
Consumed by fury
Bringer of chaos and aftermath
Laying waste to human paradise

Rising like the damned
To passing angels
Stains upon their souls
For eternity
Apocalyptic light
Shredding the world
How bitter mortality must seem to be

Bitterness once buried rising
Where the dead stood waiting
Judgement absolute for ever out of reach
Cleansing fire
Reaching for heaven scorching the sky
The god behind it sadly no longer meYou might also likeEmbed
