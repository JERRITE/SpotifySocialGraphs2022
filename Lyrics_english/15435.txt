TranslationsEspañolGirl Like Me Lyrics[Intro]
(Bongo ByTheWay)

[Verse 1: Jazmine Sullivan]
Yeah, I made a profile on Tinder
Since you left me to be with her
I think that means I'm gettin' desperate
Wish I could return to sender
But you don't love me no more
And I don't even know what for (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Knew it was real when you blocked me
Now I sit at home judgin' my body
Wondering what I did to lose you (What I did to lose you)
Why in the hell you ain't choose me?
Why you don't love me no morе? Yeah
And I don't even know what for (Nah, ah-ah)

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
You must'vе wanted somethin' different
Still don't know what I was missin'
What you asked I would've given
It ain't right how these hoes be winnin'
Why they be winnin'? Yeah (Why they be? Why they be?)
No hope for a girl like me, how come they be winnin'? Yeah
(Why they be? Why they be?)
And I ain't wanna be
But you gon' make a hoe out of me

[Verse 3: H.E.R.]
Yeah, you gon' make me a gold digger (Gold digger)
Maybe I should look like a stripper
Wearin' Fashion Nova dresses
All these dudes be so pressed and impressed with it
You, leave me with no choice (Oh, oh)
I can't do this good girl shit no more

Yeah, they be winnin' (Why they be? Why they be?)
No hope for a girl like me, how come they be winnin'? (How come they?)

So we start actin' like we don't care
