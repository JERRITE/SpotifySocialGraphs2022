Predators and Scavengers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I live in the trees
Up in the canopy
But who pulls the strings of history?
([?])
([?] parade)
[?] comic book charade

[Chorus]
Predators and scavengers
All I ever see
Have we had enough?
Will we call their bluff?
Predators and scavengers
Jackal savages
Sketchy kings and queens
Cross your country's
Stream
[Verse 2]
I imitate
A branch swings softly in the wind
My eyes are camouflaged
Mosquito on your skin
I saw it from those hungry eyes
Scavengers are all far too lateYou might also likeEmbed
