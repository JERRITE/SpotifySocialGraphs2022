I Will Go and Do (2020 Youth Theme Song) Lyrics[Verse 1: David Archuleta]
No matter where I go
I know I'm not alone
I feel my Savior there beside me
He leads me through the night
He's always been my guide
He promised He will never leave me

[Pre-Chorus: David Archuleta]
Though my burdens seem too much to bear, He'll bless me
So whatever He commands
[Chorus: David Archuleta]
I will go and do
I will stand for truth
Though the world may back away
I will walk right through
I know if I follow Him
Follow Him in faith
He will ease my burdens
And He'll provide a way
He'll provide a way

[Verse 2: David Archuleta]
When I feel overcome
And all my strength is gone
I think of all the ways He's blessed me
My journey may seem long
But He'll lift me with his love
A perfect love that's never-ending

[Pre-Chorus: David Archuleta]
He will give me, give me all the strength I'm needing
So whatever He commands

[Chorus: David Archuleta]
I will go and do
I will stand for truth
Though the world may back away
I will walk right through
I know if I follow Him
Follow Him in faith
He will ease my burdens
And He'll provide a way
He'll provide a way

For me to cross the desert
To sail across the ocean
If that's where He sends me, I'll follow His plan
I do whatever He commands me
For I know that He will lead me
To the promised land

[Chorus: David Archuleta]
I will go and do
I will stand for truth
Though the world may shut him out
I will make him room
I know if I follow Him
Follow Him in faith
He will ease my burdens
And He'll provide a way
He'll provide a way

[Outro: David Archuleta]
Hey, He'll provide a way
He
No matter where I go
I know I'm not alone
I feel my Savior there beside meEmbed
