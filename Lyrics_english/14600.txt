Liar (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Intro: Tshawe Baqwa, Girls]
You're the first thing I'll choose, but the last thing I need
Girl, I'm stuck on you so it's so hard to set me free
You're the first thing I'll choose, but the last thing I need
'Cause you's a liar (Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar), Liar

[Verse 1: Yosef Wolde-Mariam, Tshawe Baqwa]
Huh, It was the love, pain, sweat, ties
That made me stick when I was sick of the lies
The years, tears, smiles, fights
And now that I left you I cry through the mic
You was quick to slip the slickest lies
Had me surprised how you kept your calm
E'rry time you'd admit deceit
We'd hit the sheets and suddenly we on the bedroom floor
Mami, you's a (Liar), yeah
Tryna con a con
Tried to leave every time but a false alarm
It wasn't you the one who did me wrong
Girl, you a (Liar)
Like the beat don't stop
First let it slide before pride cut in
And suddenly the weak on top
[Hook: Tshawe Baqwa, Girls]
You're the first thing I'll choose, but the last thing I need
Girl, I'm stuck on you so it's so hard to set me free
You're the first thing I'll choose, but the last thing I need
'Cause you's a liar (Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar), Liar

[Verse 2: Tshawe Baqwa, Yosef Wolde-Mariam, Girls]
(I just wanted the truth)
I said she lied to me (Lied)
Can't believe a word she's crying
'Cause she lied to me (Lied)
No need to work things out
'Cause she's a liar, a pretty bad liar
But she's hot too (Bad mama)
Making it hard to move
That shit she's saying's just not true

[Verse 3: Yosef Wolde-Mariam]
First I caught her
Never knew a love like this and this was in the first half quarter
First I thought of giving her the boot
The truth is love hurts
So at first I warned her
"Be real, respect your man, don't lie
And I promise to give the candle fire"
Fuck what they say 'bout a man don't cry
'Cause I lost my love for a, for a lie
