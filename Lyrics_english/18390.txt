Throw a Lil Mo (Do It) Lyrics[Intro]
All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis
Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss
All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis
Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss (Just do it)

[Chorus]
Make him beg for a taste ‘cause he fiendin’
(All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
Hit it once, now he stuck, he can’t leave it
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
Put two hands on his ass ‘cause he need it
(All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
I be screamin’ like Mike when he beat it
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
Do it, do it (Just do it, do it)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it (Do it, do it)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Do it, do it, do it now)
[Verse 1]
Ass on fat, body on built
Bag on dumb with the body on silk
Brand new titties with the body on milk
Slut me out, put the body on him, huh
All these hoes gon’ feel it
Slim lil’ waist, had a hoe in her feelings
Twenty for the bag, at the top, I spend it
Gimme that talk with a nigga, up in it
(Touch-touch—) Touch me right, fuck me good
Get up in me like you should
Break my back and give me wood
Eat me out, I let him do it, huh
I don’t ever bring him to the crib (Why?)
‘Cause he gon’ try to love me when I leave (On God)
Love it when I tell him what it is, look
‘Cause all he ever wanna do is me, pussy

[Chorus]
Make him beg for a taste ‘cause he fiendin’
(All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
Hit it once, now he stuck, he can’t leave it (On God)
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
Put two hands on his ass ‘cause he need it
(All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
I be screamin’ like Mike when he beat it
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
Do it, do it (Just do it, do it)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Do it, do it, do it now)
Do it, do it (Do it, do it)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Do it, do it, do it now)

I like a nigga who all in my element (On God)
Can’t fuck if the nigga ain’t relevant
Bitches be hatin’ but hate for the hell of it
I ain’t stuntin’ no hoe who ain’t sellin’ shit
Hoe wanna problem with E? She ain’t tellin’ shit
‘Cause this pussy amazin’, it’s heaven sent
Teachin’ these hoes like I bought ‘em a [?]
I got the flow, I ain’t sellin’ it
Do what I want, when I want, I ain’t scared of them
He gon’ hit from the back when I’m tellin’ him
Ride on a nigga with love? I ain’t lovin’ him (Fuck)
He ain’t my man, I’m just fuckin’ him

[Chorus]
Make him beg for a taste ‘cause he fiendin’
Hit it once, now he stuck, he can’t leave it (On God)
Put two hands on his ass ‘cause he need it
I be screamin’ like Mike when he beat it
Do it, do it (All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
Do it, do it (All you ladies pop yo’ pussy like dis)
Throw a lil’ mo’, I’ma show you how to do it
(Shake ya body, don’t stop, don’t miss)
[Outro]
Do it, do it (Just do it, do it, do it)
