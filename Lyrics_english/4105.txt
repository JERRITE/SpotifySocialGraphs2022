Each whickery [letter of "each"]

[Verse 1: Firm & Maluma]
Stop getting anymore where they don't care
Think about it twice before going to open your mouth
Everyone who does just what touches him, and less anger
I look like the soul spends from your family
And I can't imagine what they say about mine
But what they say about my life is slipped

[Choir: Firm & Maluma]
And if I take almost all week
And if I want to pull the band daily
Everyone, everyone
That if I spend money on expensive things
If I leave vacation for Italy
Everyone does not rise in each who
[Post-car: Firm & Maluma, both]
If the scale is only seen to see
And if I want dawn again
Everyone

[Interlude: Maluma & Firm Group]
Oh, Apacito
Squeeze that they peed us, millet
And everyone does what they want with their lives
Or no, Maluma?
There, pa '
And pure firm group!
Firmer than ever

[Verse 2: Firm & Maluma]
Why do they ask how much I win and how much do I have?
They want to walk the money nothing else
Everyone works for not being asking about the alien
They lose anything else when they criticize me
They want to see me down and get up more motivate me
Everyone has to put well batteries without envy

[Choir: Firm & Maluma]
And if I take almost all week
And if I want to pull the band daily
Everyone, everyone
That if I spend money on expensive things
If I go on vacation for Italy
Everyone does not get entangled in everyone

If the scale is only seen to see
And if I want dawn again
