Nostalgic Lyrics[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Verse 1]
Oh, I felt weak tonight
'Cause I caught myself not being caught up with the times
Strangely, you and I cross the finish line
But big hearts move slow, get left behind
[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But sometimes, I still remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)
Woah, I can't stop it (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
It's all locked up inside
This giant hole, this stupid quicksand life of mine
And I guess I can't let go, even though I've tried
But it'll stay here with me 'til the day I die

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying next to someone else, oh
But I'll always remember what you said and how it felt

[Chorus]
Okay, fine, maybe I'm just a little nostalgic
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it
I know I said I wouldn't call, but I'm breaking my promise
'Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby, I can't stop it

Oh, oh, oh (Woah, ooh)
('Cause the memories are flooding my mind, baby I can't stop it)
Oh (Woah, woah)

('Cause the memories are flooding my mind)
Woah, I can't stop
