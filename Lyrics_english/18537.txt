Bouncing off the Walls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't do it for the stunt, I been self-made from the jump, I ain't going out like a punk
Why you getting high, getting drunk, chasing women in the club?
Me? I'm chasing after them bucks, ain't none of this luck
This was all planned at the gate, making sure my family straight
And before I ever even thought about taking a bite, I would make sure my family ate
White boy from the 'burbs, think I never struggled in my life?
Think I never hustled in my life?
Turn on the news and I see that my cousin got shot
He was 17 when he died, none of this for the clout
I would overdraft my account, people stole food out my mouth
I was living on the couch
I was having so many doubts, there ain't shit you can tell me about
Rez
[Chorus]
Bouncing off the walls again, ay ay
Don't know who to call again, ay ay
Used to take my time with shit, now I'm down to lose it all again
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls, there's a chance I'm gonna fall
I've been bouncing off the walls

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've been making a change, plus I've been making some change
Had to grow up at a young age, I was going insane
Felt like I was trapped in a cage, around a bunch of people that betrayed
Me and my trust, losing real love for some lust
I was chasing after that rush
Surrounded by the snakes and the fakes that would smile to my face
Could've died and they wouldn't give a fuck
They don't care about me, never asked how I feel
Never asked how I feel
I'ma put it all on the line if you died right now, you lived fake and I know I died real
Independent, no deal
I used to wan't to make friends with these rappers but they all fake flex
I've been on the grind since living in my mamma house
I was living paycheck to paycheck

Bouncing off the walls again, ay ay
Don't know who to call again, ay ay
Used to take my time with shit, now I'm down to lose it all again
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls, there's a chance I'm gonna fall
I've been bouncing off the walls
I've been bouncing off the walls2Embed
