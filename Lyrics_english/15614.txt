I wonder Lyrics [lyrics by "I wonder"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Way around the city, looking at the sky 
 The rain makes me think that you are far 
 People come and go, I freeze 
 Just to land in your memory 

 [Chorus] 
 I wonder why I can't find you 
 Everything talks about you, but you are not 
 I wonder why you could leave 
 I think I can see you, but you are not 
 [Verse 2] 
 Way through the city 
 I look for your mouth, nobody knows where it is 
 I think I'm alone 
 People come and go I just hope 
 Right in the same place to your memory 

 [Chorus] 
 I wonder why I can't find you 
 Everything talks about you, but you are not 
 I wonder why you could leave 
 I think I can see you, but you are not 
 I wonder why (OH) 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) I can't find you 
 (Uh, oh, oh, oh) Everything talks about you 
 But you are not 
 I wonder why (uh, oh, ah, ah) 
 You could go 
 I think I can see you, but you are not 
 I wonder why ... You Might Also Like2embed
