Only for you Lyricsllegas thinking and suddenly
And you didn't delete my mind
I don't care what people said
That I was a criminal

You stayed with me
The most beautiful roses surrounded your castle
You are the princess of my heart
When I am cold alone in you she sheltered

My heart only thinks about you
Just cries for you, he only suffers for you Heiheie
My heart only thinks about you
Just cries for you, he only suffers for you Heiheie
How long I have to wait
To have you in my arms
Tell you how much I love you
I don't want to wake up from this dream
I want to sleep next to you
Tell you how much I love you

I want you to know that I long for you
That the love I feel for you is pure sincere
They shine in heaven like thousands of flashes
I just remember the aroma of your hair

My heart only thinks about you
Just cries for you, he only suffers for you Heiheie
My heart only thinks about you
Just cries for you, he only suffers for you Heiheie

You arrive thinking and suddenly
And you didn't delete my mind
I don't care what people said
That I was a criminal

You stayed with me
The most beautiful roses surrounded your castle
You are the princess of my heart
When I am cold alone in you she sheltered
You Might Also Likemi heart just think about you
