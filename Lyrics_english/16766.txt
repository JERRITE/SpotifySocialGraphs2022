Chimbambaira Lyrics[Intro: Nutty O]
It's the Shottaz
Chimbambaira
Ability Extension
Chimbambaira
King Forward
Chimbambaira
Coming to you from another world....

[Verse 1: Max Shotta]
Careful when you step inna session
There's a dozen landmine and dem live
This is not a drill this is real
Take one wrong step you'll ignite
Take over your senses, you're defenceless
We go hard we're relentless and it's just
The beginning of a long night
So I suggest that you get your mind right
It's go time, now it's showtime
Time to kick rhymes designed to blow minds
No time for fun got not time for games
More time for winners no time lames
Swinging for the fences, relentlessly
Ravage the scene like a tempest
It's gonna be a rough ride
And so I hope that you got your mind right
[Hook: Max Shotta]
Chimbambaira

Keys to the city

[Verse 3: Hlats]
When we come through, kicking big tunes
Lyrical kung-fu like Jet Li, I'm Bruce Lee
Deh with Nutty-O di Bwoy
It is a mine field blowing ceilings
When we step pon di riddim we dangerous
Hazardeous to di mic we're cancerous
Radio Active, DJs playing us
Get the crowd high like we're angel dust
Move fast leave dust when we pass
Bwoy can't touch the style registered trademark
Badmind can only pass their remarks
Pinocchio nose, when they lie we advance
We just making music
They're making excuses
Either way they're song and dones
Mbappe pon di riddim patinoshooter
Blowing up the place sepatsikwa...
