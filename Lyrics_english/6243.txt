Real Good Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spill wine on the hotel sheets
Oh well well well
We laugh it off with our purple teeth
Palm trees and the dirty streets
Oh yeah yeah yeah
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd give up anything to be with you
Nothing like blue skies in the rearview
And now it's 6 AM and we're still awake
I'm feelin' alright, no I can't complain
[Chorus]
It's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life
'Cause I got you by my side
And there's a sun in the sky
Yeah it's a real good life
It's a real good life
It's a real good life

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up on an empty beach
Oh yeah yeah yeah
One two three and I'm on my feet
Got "Purple Rain" playin' on repeat
That's right that's right
And I'm catchin' feels when you look at me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd give up anything to be with you
All of the bad things that I'm into
And now it's 6 AM and we're still awake
I'm feelin' alright, no I can't complain

[Chorus]
It's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life
'Cause I got you by my side
And there's a sun in the sky
Yeah it's a real good life
It's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life

Feel good and I just can't lie
Me and you stayin' up all night
Feel good and I just can't lie
(It's a real good life, yeah)

[Chorus]
It's a real good life
Yeah it's a real good life
It's a real good life
(Ain't nothing gonna bring you down)
It's a real good life
It's a real good life (good)
It's a real good life1Embed
