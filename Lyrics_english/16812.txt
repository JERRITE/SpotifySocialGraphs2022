Arsonal vs Pat Stay Lyrics[Round 1: Arsonal]
Pat Stay is a sucka free boss, but he'll be left dead
If you ever let the cals (cows) fly
Want beef? I'll eject lead
Your favorite movie is How High but you neglect Red
Cause Red smoke weed, this motherfuckers a Meth head
In my city you wouldn't show face
I wouldn't let you get a penny off the dollar at a slow pace
I'm a gorilla but in yo' place, I'm just a nigga
Your mother, I'll kill her (Killa) without Ghostface
Now I'm slaying him, hooking, souffleing him
I'ma show y'all ten ways to kill a Canadian
First, feed him to the American people
Two, dress him from head to toe in American Eagle
Three, make him read the American Bible
Four is simple, don't let him watch no American Idol
Put you in a cell with an American fag
Make your Canadian bitch Carrie Weber suck 13 stripes off of my American flag
Six and seven, just bury the guy
Cock and let the Glock bust faster than Jimbo on American Pie
Eight and nine they both definitely bad
Pat, your past is no comparison to any of the rest of these fags
Number ten, tell you I ain't done
Then yell, "Hey son, you really got an African American dad."
Now it's time to radio in, Canadian down location
Nova Scotia, some small Canadian town
Hostile posed a threat so I engaged on sight
They like, "Other words you just killed Pat Stay, right?"
Wrong Bishop, I just killed Pat Stay wife in front of Pat
Pat ain't do shit cause Pat can't fight
But ooh, don't let me catch him slipping
Have Pat in a bad position
Shooters on the roof, the scope attach for the Mac's precision
One blast, Pat in half, that was fast division
Split him into two by accident, oops I'm a bad magician
Abracadabra, I smack, tackle I clap, you're my gat packed in my knapsack
I'm back packing my clapper
Black gats will clap to you wack talentless cast
But I'm past Pat on a fast track
Raps travelling past ya
Y'all remember Fight Klub when Hollow's eyes showed the fear
I Scorpioned that nigga told his ass, "Get over here."
Beat him up public, fuck waiting til the coast is clear
Chicken noodle soup on him and threw a lot of jokes in there
That was in '09
2010 was my smoking year
That bud got me wiser, no alcohol, beat yo' face with an open beer
You copy, you capiche, you Canadian fag
I disrespect you and smoke the leaf off the Canadian flag
Your time is up and you know it's over
I brought a map of Canada put a hole where you from so I could fuck Nova Scotia
[Round 1: Pat Stay]
Ha, Arsonal, Arsonal
Ain't a damn man as dark as you
You only beat Dizaster cause when them lights went out no one knew who the fuck he was talking to
Christ, he could bust off his piece like, "fuck the police"
Cause if it's dark out, Arsonal is up in a tree
Cops won't find him for shit
Unless he crumples some leaves and they crack a funny as joke and he shows a couple of teeth
Wait, wait, don't get it fucked up, I'm just dissing his physical features
This slithering, primitive creature is so thin he could swim in his t-shirt
My girl goes to the beauty salon and asks for a pedicure
Arsonal goes to the beauty salon and asks for "The Predator"
He's a school bus driver!
Like how could you take him seriously y'all?
It's not a joke, that's his actual career, that's his job
He prolly drove the school bus here with his dawgs singing 99 bottles of beer on the wall
You ain't busting your tool bitch, you busing to school
Screaming at little kids that keep fucking with you and chucking up food
Threatening to cancel the field trip, pulling over on the side of the road
Like, "I can turn this bus around and we can just all go home."
Wait, wait, just had to clown him right quick but let me put it down like this
I'm Pat Stay, Canada's champ I'm down right slick
Moonwalk on water with brick tied around my kicks
I am the shit
Shake the world when I pound my fists
Fuck Arsonal Da Rebel
You dancing in the darkness with the Devil
Mind power sharp enough sever, my heart's leather
Make you step back like car alarm sensors
You wouldn't spark metal if you were an arc welder
And no matter what happens after this battle
He'll act like he had it in the palm of his hand
But he switched it to promo a minute ago cause if he lost he'd call it a scam
You need to grow some motherfucking balls and stop being scared
Haul up your pants and learn to take a fucking loss like a man
You have no backbone, you sensitive sweet
He got no criminal cases he does video statements in 1080P
I mean, if he's able to cross the boarder he's obviously not what he's pretending to be
Cause if Canadians let him in like radio editing his record is clean

Like I told you on Twitter, I ain't the one for all the yelling in my face Pat
That's like midgets, and I motherfucking hate that
You'll get ape slapped til your neck and your face crack
White boy you'll be black the day Diddy took Ma$e back
You a hockey fan
Your best friend is a convict, racist ass Nazi, Klan, Canadian, Yugoslavian, pussy ass bonti man
Bishop called to say, "Ars', please kill Pat the first month of the year."
I said, "So you want me to take him is oxy-gen?"
He had problems with a Hollohan
You must ain't seen the Fight Klub what I did to the whole Hollow man
Man, shit got a little out of hand
He tried to steal my style for a while I exchanged his life for the contraband
But you? You a big bitch, so we gon' play the wordplay game
Cause to me your wordplay lame
You say shit like, "Moon walking in steal toe boots"
"I put that Eagle to your chest like Bird Gang chain"
That's cause your nostrils was decorated with cocaine stains
A real nigga step in your face your whole domain change
Pussy, my money done grew up
You big...as hell, but I fuck you up
I stomp you in some tall dark blue Chucks
Bang nines at you fucks, gang signs get threw up
Then I put the piece/peace to you without chucking the deuce up
Think about it
Voice your opinion and sing about it
Read about it, read about it, I talk cause I be about it
Your outfit I beat you out it
Right in front the pastor or the reverend bredren
At the alter while your church cathedral's crowded
Now that's perfection put together so precisely
You purposely provoking me posing like you don't like me
So if I prove with pictures
In panties Pat, you gon' fight me?
Cause all that's gonna mean is that I Brian Pumpered your wifey
I fingered that bitch until her pussy did the rain dance
I dug in my nose and slapped your mother with the same hand
I ain't playing with these words, I am great fam'
With nouns, Aye Verb will die playing Hang Man
Pussy, you don't even seem hard
I keep two Desert Eagles cocked on the dashboard of your dream car
I'm on your mind, your last thought when you think hard
You couldn't enter my city with a passport and a green card
But ooh, if I catch homie, I'ma hit him with that vest on him
Fuck if he my fan, I'll pull a Ron Artest on him
Break down the big apple on this big bitch
Outta New York I fly my Giants on them Jets towards him
We met in Spanish Harlem, I had them jankies pull them Tec's on him
Trigger finger got an itch and I'm feeling froggy
So I'ma leap onto the street and then commit a robbery
Then I'm gonna leap onto the beat and then commit a homi
Then I might leap onto and push my meat into your mommy
You from Nova Scotia, that's where you from faggot
You little dumb bastard
I'm 'bout to shove five Canadians in one casket
You on a date your water break, you little dumb actress
I'll break into your house then urinate on your son mattress
I shit on his pillowcase, give and take
Lift him straight over my head, I'll bench press him and watch his liver shake
Devour your insides for breakfast on a dinner plate
Then knock your teeth out like your mouth tried to renovate
Game over, press the button, start the simulate
I'll bend your bitch over, Carrie Weber and let my cock head penetrate
I got bread, I've been a great, I'll pop lead, I finish fakes
I'm a pothead, I'm in at space, you'll drop dead and get erased
I'm nice
Patrick you gon' pay the price
This world like Jumanji pussy, you gon' shake the dice
You'll ace on your first roll
I fucked your bitch in her third hole
I'm the young nigga with the old soul
No ice in my ears cause my lobes closed
New jewels, old clothes, pinkie ring is rose gold
I done traveled across the world and seen the whole globe
Six shot Dillinger empty, you'll get the whole load
Four arm clipping
You defeating me don't look right, nah like putting a 34 on Pippen
My JDP foolies they-
[Organik]
Alright yo we gotta call it

[Round 2: Pat Stay]
Now Arsonal claims that he's a Crip
And I ain't dissing the Crip crew
It's true, he is, his moms was a Crip too
It all started when me and the clique slid through
She was on her red rag so the bitch just blew/blue
Jaws like a Pitbull, suck your dick til she get a chipped tooth
I fucked that bitch in the ass til she sounded like Chip-Fu having a big poop
See that's what she meant by a gangbang and this guy was just confused
We be filming scenes for Bangbus and he drive the kids to school
Yo, I'm sick of this dude fronting
He's like, "I'm a gangsta. I'll just shoot ya
I fucking shot my mama in the face with a bazooka."
He said he'll never forget the first time he seen one die
I said, "Damn, what'd you do?"
He said, "I picked it up shook it and rolled a five."
Moral of the story is he's a fake, there's nothing more for me to say
He held the door for me today and I was 40 feet away
He's a fucking sweetheart, he never gangbanged  in his life
And Superman ain't losing to this fake Crip tonight/kryptonite
Wait, the bus man is Cripping? That shit is impossible
I'm letting the principle's office know
I'll send this bitch to the hospital and you better bring in a doctor's note
You go to prison and drop the soap and turn into a soccer pro
So take Squidward's clarinet and your invisible Glock and go get you an arsenal/Arsonal
See you think you tough but I ain't Conceited though
Try to punk me around I- T.K.O
I could punch a hole through your chest and swing your body around like pizza dough
Put you in a sleeper hold til your breathing goes
And leave you in the freezing cold til you decompose
Free your soul
Split your wig til you can see his skull
From hitting him with the same stick that the Grim Reaper holds
How's that?
It's like getting hit with a loud smack
I don't pop bottles but I twist around caps
Walk through the streets stomping my feet til the ground crack
You know the motherfucking name I got this shit down Pat
Wait, but I'm just a white boy from Canada right?
Who cares if I'm white?
You racist piece of shit all you do is stereotype
Well guess what
My dicks bigger, I rap better, plus I fight live
And even in basketball the best shooters are the white guys

[Round 3: Arsonal]
I'm fresh off a body bag and I'm trying to see this money
I just murdered a Hitman in New York that's why I had to flee the country
Last time I tried to cook, I had a little trouble crossing the boarder
Cause they know I travel with a black K
Boarder patrol asked me and Ryan, "Where y'all going?" What'd I say?
"Where ever the fuck Pat Stay
Now either you gon' get the fuck out my way or give me the directions."
He pointed that way, said your mom's a whore I might need some protection
I said, "Damn Ryan that bitch that bad?"
He said, "Ars', I fuck around beat Pat dad
Every male in Canada done pinned they tail on that donkey."
You jackass
Your mother birthed you in a crack lab
Under her white pussy she put a black bag
And called you a "stupid little nigga." when she conceived you like you had a black dad
And I said, "Hold on cocky bitch
I beat shit down your leg with the bottom end of a hockey stick
Your son Pat ain't got no job on his Tommy shit
He swallow dick and he take meat
I call him 'Young Teriyaki stick.."
Now something y'all might know, in '05 his man Hollohan got jumped and he dipped
Why you did that?

[Pat Stay]
That's bullshit

[Arsonal]
No, it's not bullshit
He asked if you gon' ride
You was like, "Nah, I ain't with that."
But by you running, made it seem as if you was on the get back
It's like you took the snap and they David Beckham'd his chinstrap
He could've died upon impact
What you was gonna do? Be a friend and take his body to Nova Scotia so he be sleeping where the fish at?
Nigga you talk about busting yo' thang, you a customer fiend
You wouldn't even give me a run for the green
Your similarities to this hustling team
Eddie Guerrero, Owen Hart or Turo Gotti?
Y'all all dead white boys who wasn't scared to jump in the ring
Now at my last battle, I was told I lived the Bob Saget, Baptist life, right?
So I beat that nigga to death with Squidward's clarinet cause I felt as though he lived the Spongebob/Patrick life
But you Patrick, you a mix breed hermaphrodite
Against Arsonal, I'm larger than Big T's appetite
I give and take oxygen
I be Wait Watching him
You always come up short with your green, you Nate Robinson
You talk about guns in your raps but you ain't popping 'em
Now bite the curb and watch me stomp you with suave moccasins
I run up on your dice game strapped, bank stopped again
I ain't gotta say you unarmed, tank top again
You see me, you haul ass, you ain't confident
Cause I rap, you talk Jazz, John Stockton him
You old fuck nigga
Seven foot bum nigga
John Cena in the face ass battle rapper, but much bigger
Your bitch mad that she stuck with ya
So she make you pay to fuck since you "sucka free" and you just lick her
That bitch suck dick on a private plane on an air bed
From take off to landing, non stop, she's an airhead
I'm never sober, it's hard to think with a clear head
When I'm done with you I'ma hang you on my wall next to my there heads
I ain't say "deer heads" I said "there heads"
Hollow Da Don, Hitman, Remy, their heads
Tech-9, Conceited, Dizaster, their heads
Okwerdz, Rich Dollarz, Pat Stay, their heads!
Airhead

{Organik stops Arsonal again for going over the set time limit}

[Round 3: Pat Stay]
Your moms looks like Beetlejuice
And the girl that he dates
Looks like that cop from The First 48 who crashed and burned off his face
So I fucked her
Make your boy look better, right?
I wanted to see who's bigger
That bitch said his dick looked like E.T.'s finger
And are those strings of shit or locks?
You did a really shitty job
What type of fitted do you rock, a fucking kitty litter box?
Ayo, it's disgusting ain't it?
Tight jeans looking like my mother's leggings suffocating
A couple gay kids saw him and called him a "fucking faggot"
Let's bash his rep though
Before his Hitman Holla battle I thought he had potential
That shit had to be off the top of his head cause that was dreadful
And whoever did Arsonal's dreads must've wanted him dead
Cause he got murdered by a Hitman and his barber put a knot on his head
And what the fuck kind of gangsta mentions Squidward's clarinet?
Yo, I bet he didn't even know what it was and his kids were scared to death
You fucking idiot, you got a brain like a brick
He thought Black Eyed Peas was a youtube video of some brother taking a piss
He even spelled his own name wrong
A-R-S-O-N-A-L
Never made it through grade 12
I raise Hell, an arson with an arsenal spit flames from a caged cell
I'll leave a hole in the middle of Arsonal like the way that his name's spelled
I'm light years beyond you, the nightmare that haunts you
Fuck rap we can scrap right here if you want to
Let's scrap now, I'm King Kong bitch I'll fight til the last round
Passing through security is the only way you'll get Pat down
Oh what you think? Cause we from Canada we thought y'all hard?
The bus driver, the janitor and the crosswalk guard
Damn right I'm from Scotia my dick's as long as my fishing rod
Your mom's type
That bitch a crackhead the way she be blowing that hard white
But look
He mad right now
Spongebob 'bout to get stabbed right now
And yo homie, nobody where's brown right now
Man, and you said I can't even dunk in that blog that you did
Well I have a broken ankle and I just dunked on you with my balls on your chin
SuckaEmbed
