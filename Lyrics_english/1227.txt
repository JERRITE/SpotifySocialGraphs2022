Homesick - Acoustic Lyrics[Verse 1]
If home is where the heart is
I got an empty hole inside my chest
I always said it's what I wanted
But you're killing me Los Angeles

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't sleep at night
Every time I close my eyes
I'm torn between two lives
I hate this feeling, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm homesick but I lost the key
I know the old me is still underneath somewhere
I'm homesick but I lost my way
Under all the weight, feel it every day, I swear
I'm homesick
I feel alone in a crowded room
But I lost the key
I know the old me is still underneath somewhere
I'm homesick
A part of me I don't wanna lose
But I lost my way
Under all the way, feel it every day, I swear

[Verse 2]
It's hard to tell what's real when
Nobody lets their guard down here
And god I miss my old friends
And driving where the air is clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't sleep at night
Every time I close my eyes
I'm torn between two lives
I hate this feeling

I'm homesick but I lost the key
I know the old me is still underneath somewhere
I'm homesick but I lost my way
Under all the weight, feel it every day, I swear
I'm homesick
I feel alone in a crowded room
But I lost the key
I know the old me is still underneath somewhere
I'm homesick
A part of me I don't wanna lose
But I lost my way
Under all the way feel it every day, I swear

[Outro]
When I first moved to LA
I never thought I would miss home so much
But now that I'm up there and I go back I never wanna leave
You don't realize when you're there
That you're gonna miss it so much
But once you leave, you do1Embed
