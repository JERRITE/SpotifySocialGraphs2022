Freaky Like Me Lyrics[Intro]
Haha, it’s Madcon
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me - me me
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me - me me

[Verse 1 - Tshawe:]
It was early in the morning
I hit a shower runnin'
I almost got remamber who this girl might be
And then she came back
I couldn't belive my eyes
This pretty young thang with her eyes on me
[Pre - Chorus - Yosef:]
I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in you ear, tell me how you like that
Came Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer

[Hook:]
No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

No-one's gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like me-
Me-me, No-one

[Verse 2 - Tshawe:]
I'm feeling up their tighs
I'm running out of course
I had my kitty "Urr" as she laid on me
We windin' and grindin'
I bought you advises
Baby, you're like a fireburnin' motor on me

[Pre - Chorus - Yosef]
I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in you ear, tell me how you like that
Came Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer

[Bridge - Tshawe:]
Shawty, know I never ever ever pulled you
Do you whisker on a freaky year as I do
Shawty, know I never ever ever pulled you
Do you whisker on a freaky year as I do

[Verse 3 - Ameerah:]
Cause imma going crazy when you do me like that
Your freaky-eaky got me holding ridin tracks
Everytime you think I wanna push it right back
Come back, I need that no one can fix it like that
