Nexus Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-ay-oh
Oh-ay-oh-ay
Oh-ay-oh
Oh-ay-oh-ay

[Verse 1]
Au-automatic weapon
A criminal appetite for affection
I romanticize murder, now you sweating
And I think I got a thing for a felon
Sounds like heaven, what's the consensus?
Bring that girl over here, now the next chick (Nah)
Now she all up in my ear but where her friend is?
Now they both hanging on me like a necklace
I'm ambidextrous, aye
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am (Yah, yah)
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand (Yah, yah)
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am (Yah, yah)
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand (Yah, yah)

[Chorus]
Now you're looking at the Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus (Ah ha)
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest (Woo)
Look to your right, now your left, no precious (Mmm)
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus

[Verse 2]
Cynical about reality
Lyrical with criminal versatility
Out of principal, got minimal morality
I'll take your chick, just like it's a formality
Now you're mad at me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am (You know who I am)
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand (Just a lil bit, just a lil bit)
I don't wanna talk like a boss
But we both know you know who I am (You know who I am)
And I know that the way it comes off
Might seem a little bit off hand

[Chorus]
Now you're looking at the Nexus (Ha)
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest (Woo)
Look to your right, now your left, no precious (Uh)
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless (Yeah)
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus (Nexus)
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest (Ah ha)
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless (Yeah, yeah)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Better than expected
Ultimately unaffected
I'm not worried 'bout the next bitch
‘Cause I'm the next bitch
Better than expected
Ultimately unaffected
I'm not worried 'bout the next bitch
‘Cause I'm the next bitch
And the next and the next bitch
[Chorus]
I'm the Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the motherfucking Nexus
Nothing better than the best, I'm the bestest
Look to your right, now your left, no precious
Yeah, I whip it so wild ‘cause I'm reckless
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the Nexus
