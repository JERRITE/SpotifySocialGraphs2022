How do I make you understand Lyrics [lyrics of "how I make you understand"]

[Intro]
How do I make you understand that nobody was more?
That nothing is needed more than your presence
That nothing hurts me as your absence does
How do I make you understand that nobody was more?

[Verse 1]
How do I make you understand that my life without you
Is it just time that happens without you?
[Chorus]
How do I make you understand? That I miss me
Like air, like water to live

[Pre-car]
How do I make you understand this bitter taste?
Flavor of defeat that grows in my mouth
When you are not here
How do I make you understand that my soul breaks?
And I can't help it when you leave
When I don't know about you
How do I make you understand that it is stronger than me?
I didn't want you to fall in love

[Chorus]
How do I make you understand? That I miss me
Like air, like water to live
How do I make you understand?

[Pre-car]
How do I make you understand this bitter taste?
Flavor of defeat that grows in my mouth
When you are not here
How do I make you understand that my soul breaks?
And I can't help it when you leave
When I don't know about you
How do I make you understand that it is stronger than me?
I didn't want you to fall in love

How do I make you understand? That I miss me
Like air, like water to live

[Verse 2]
And what else can I do to please you
With everything I tell you, I can't convince you
I sing this song
I want to know your decision, girl, say

[Bridge]
How do I make you understand?
How do I make you understand?
This bitter taste that grows in my mouth
That vice of you that I can't break
How do I make you understand?
How do I make you understand?
I am delivered to you whole body
And I can't convince you
How do I make you understand?
How do I make you understand?
Why don't you let you kiss your lips
And that my delirium drunk you with love?
How do I make you understand?
How do I make you understand?
Love me and you will see, to love me
Bold, you'll never regret
[Instrumental]

[Bridge 2]
How do you want me to make you understand?
If I give you what you ask, my life
And how do you want - tenderness and pleasure - which makes you understand?
Also a lot of love
How do you want me to make you understand?
And when you're leaving at night
And how do you want - do not sleep waiting for you - who makes you understand?
Enter female to look for your love, arrives

[Instrumental]

[Bridge 3]
I want to know what you think of me, I can no longer
How do you want me to make you understand?
After one lives twenty or two hundred years
And how do you want -but what does one matter -what do I make you understand?
And realize that everything is a lie
How do you want me to make you understand?
That nothing, nothing, Nadita is true
And how do you want - and that is why, I give you a thousand thanks -which make you understand?
The lesson came to my hairbed
