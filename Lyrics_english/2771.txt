TranslationsPortuguÃªsDeutschGood Grief Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no such thing as good grief
Haven't eaten in three weeks
Skin and bones when you're not near me
I'm all skeleton and melody

[Verse 2]
There's no such thing as good grief
Sleep with you in a sex dream
And I'm pretty sure you don't miss the way
I put all my demons on display to your pretty music
[Chorus]
One more time, play me something, I won't sing
I'll be quiet, play me something
One more time, I'm listening

[Verse 3]
There's no such thing as good grief
Took two months to pack up your things
But I left a box at your parents' house
Don't know whether to feel sad or proud

[Chorus]
One more time, play me something, I won't sing
I'll be quiet, play me something
One more time, I'm listeningYou might also like1Embed
