TranslationsEspa√±olGolden Dandelions Lyrics[Verse 1]
She came to me in robes of white
In the corner of my room
A specter of the night
Silhouetted by the moon
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
Colors burst as I close my eyes

[Chorus]
Ooo-oooh, she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooo-oooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting
[Verse 2]
A thousand pictures in my mind
In a painting of the past
I'm brushing over lines
And I'll paint them all again
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
Colors burst as I close my eyes

[Chorus]
Ooo-oooh, she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooo-oooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting

[Bridge]
And aren't we bright
In the candlelight?
I will cradle all these memories
Until the end

[Chorus]
And she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooo-oooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitingYou might also like9Embed
