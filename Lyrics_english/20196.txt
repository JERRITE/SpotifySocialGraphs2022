​what did yøu think i meant when i said i løve yøu Lyrics[Intro]
I do
Remember I told you?
Remember?
I-I don't want to
'Cause I don't want tomorrow to come, yet
I'm like, not ready for tomorrow

[Verse 1]
I used to wonder why you don't go
Baby girl I'm so low
I been missing every single moment in that photo
I been missing every little text you sent with xo
Why didn't you say so
Every time I messed up
Every time I broke a promise
Every time you dressed up
Babe I wish you spoke up
Wish I never woke up
Without you by my side
Wish we never broke up
Dealing with these slow cuts
Guess I like the pain
Blood soaked sheets
Fuck I hope it doesn't stain
Momma gonna kill me if she see this shit again
Floating through the city like I got nothing to gain
Hoping that it rains
I'm just hoping that it rains
[Bridge]
It's getting hard to stay and I don't know what else to do
Only one girl I ever loved and it was you
I'm tryna get through
I'm just tryna get through
Cøzybøy crying over shit he can't undo

[Verse 2]
I used to wonder why you don't go
Baby girl I'm so low
I been missing every single moment in that photo
I been missing every little text you sent with xo
Why didn't you say so
Every time I messed up
Every time I broke a promise
Every time you dressed up
Babe I wish you spoke up
Wish I never woke up
Without you by my side
Wish we never broke up
Dealing with these slow cuts
Guess I like the pain
Blood soaked sheets
Fuck I hope it doesn't stain
Momma gonna kill me if she see this shit again
Floating through the city like I got nothing to gain
Hoping that it rains
I'm just hoping that it rainsYou might also like6Embed
