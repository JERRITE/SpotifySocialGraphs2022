Feel Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna feel better
No one's ever gonna love me like that again
I don't wanna get over you
I wanna sit with you in bed
I don't wanna feel better
I'd give anything to miss you again
I don't wanna get over it
I wanna get under it instead

[Verse 2]
The book sits on top of clean and messy blankets
On a bed that fuckin' creaks at night when I get in it late
And late at night, I'm chugging Gatorade
And someone's breaking up when I crack up
Because I know I'll never know just what to say
I'm a communist, a terrorist, an MPDG thot
Or I'm a sad girl in a dorm room, living out the shady Christian plot of
Twilight or The Bible or The Lover by Duras
Or I'm just really fuckin' selfish and really fuckin' lost
[Chorus]
But someone loved me, someone fucking loved me
Someone fucking loved me and I fuckin' loved them too
Goddamn it, I was worth something, I fuckin' learned something
I had my I had my cake (I ate it, it ate me too and, God, no)

[Post-Chorus]
"I don't wanna feel better"
(I don't wanna feel better)
(I'd give anything to miss you again)
(I don't wanna get over it)
(I wanna rip it to shreds)

[Verse 3]
We kept our liquor in a suitcase underneath my bed
And we drank it to go out or just stay in or to feel sad
But in a hot way, a way I'll fuckin' never have again
The sun has began to set
I'm a socialist, Marxist, libertarian slut
I am an awkward teenage virgin and I sort of kinda laugh a lot in bed
But other times, I cry or don't make noise at all
I'd give my life to have a room that feels that small

[Chorus]
'Cause someone loved me, someone fucking loved me
Someone fucking loved me, I loved them too
Goddamn it, I was worth something, I fuckin' earned something
I had a right to die, a right to live, a right to choose, too
And God, no!
Of course, I don't wanna feel better!
Can you fucking imagine?!
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
No one's ever gonna love me like that again
I don't wanna get over it, I wanna rip the stars to shreds
I don't wanna feel better

[Verse 4]
Of course it hurt, of course it fuckin' hurt
It hurt like nothing in the world sometimes
That I was super scared, and we were all a train-wreck
And also somehow making it
I think I might've died there twice and I would do it all again
I'm a nihilist, a soldier, an OCD-machine
Or I'm a healthy baby-girl who traded sunshine for disease
But when my head hit my cheap pillow, I could tell I had a heart
And I wanna tear this fascist Milky Way apart

[Bridge]
'Cause someone loved me, someone fuckin' loved me
All my filthy life I loved someone I barely knew
Goddamn it, I was worth something, I fuckin' learned something
And it felt better in my mouth than fresh warm food
I guess I loved you, I guess I really loved you
All my filthy life I loved someone I barely knew
And now you're over there and I'm way over here
What am I gonna do?
[Outro]
I don't wanna feel better
No one's ever gonna love me like that again
I don't wanna get over you
I wanna sit with you in bed
I don't wanna feel better
(I don't wanna feel better)17Embed
