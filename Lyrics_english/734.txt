[Verse: Obladaet & OG Buda]
I ask (buda), no extra words
Big Boy - Sub Zero (Big What?), I turn it into ice
Minus three hundred, Yeah (cache), but I did not freeze
And on me Tesla, money, bitch, autopilot
Air drop, jumped into the plane (PEW)
I fly in the sky (Ha), white Air Force (Yeah, Yeah)
You will not solve where, bitch, I'm a random (What?)
And I burn (yeah), twist (yeah), like Fire Ball, Air drop
The bitch gave the throat in the car, on me Bitcoin (cache)
Three-nol-one-nine, Obla-Vlone, Balenciaga, Kush, I smoke it
I did not disappoint to summer, fuck sport
I have bad bitches with me, a whole escort
Sweet fog, and I take a breath
I walk around the sky - Money Walk
I do not see you through the glass dior
OBLA - player, I want Ace on flop
Trap Casino, I threw the chips on the table, this is my sport (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
New season and I am the one who will raise the team from the bottom (Yeah, Yeah)
Remember in the face, trophies on me and we smoke the lawn (Yeah, Yeah)
Please give me a sign, but only without words (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
