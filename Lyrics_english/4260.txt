WHEN IT WAS? Lyrics [lyrics by "When was it?"]

[Intro: ysy a]
OKEY, YEAH
YSY A, OKEY (OKEY)
OKEY, YEAH (UJU)

[Chorus: ysy a]
When it was? (When it was?)
That grew so much (so much)
These feet (these foot ')
You don't enter what (the ones)
I lent you (I lent you)
And I'm still late (afternoon)
A do 'o tre' (a do 'or tre')
But it was already (but it was already)
I never get wrong what only I know how to do (just I know how to do)
He smiled and brought them a water bucket for thirst (for thirst)
Stories of Vminad, no Internet photos (DÐµ Internet)
Little 'word' who understands the Parla
And now they buy it and sell it, uh
[Verse: ysy a]
And I wonder when it was, or did it always?
I ask God to remind me
Because Die 'I don't even remember and I barely spent twenty
Page 'pa' that your grandson and great -grandson do the homework, yes
I have a machine that channels the pretty 'and discards the ugly', yes
She tells me that she is a teacher of Twerk, that I speak to her and choreography
And when it arrives, they uncover pencils, that ass is self-auto, wuh, huh
And I don't even a tattoo, with pure chain
Look at your team to copy the look, and already in case no jeweler comes to us (OKEY; WUH, WUH)
My blind note '(Wuh)
My flow
A mix from Riquelme and Ortega, on the court save who can (Wuh, Wuh)
When it was? (When it was?)
I learned everything 'these tricks
Broncoospasmo, they talk about Bricks
And they don't sneeze even a hashish
They look for a magazine cover, even a view in their nose
Ysy A is more than an artist, Ysy A is more than a country

[Chorus: ysy a]
When it was? (When it was?)
That grew so much (so much)
These feet (these feet)
You don't enter what (the ones)
I lent you (I lent you)
And I'm still late (afternoon)
A do 'o tre' (a do 'or tre')
But it was already (but it was already)
I never get wrong what only I know how to do (just I know how to do)
He smiled and brought them a water bucket for thirst (for thirst)
Truth stories, no Internet photos (Internet)
Few word 'pa' who understands
And now they buy it and sell it, when was it? You Might Also Likeembed
