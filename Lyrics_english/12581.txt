When Am I Gonna Lose You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wait, when am I gonna lose you?
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?
Trace the curving of the coastline
The Santa Lucia cliffside
We'll stay here for the night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I remember you said
Everything has its place
Now I lie in our bed
Wondering how to explain
[Chorus]
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose

[Verse 2]
Take another one if you need it
Or do you already feel it?
I felt it from the start
Engrave the silhouette of you dancing
A shadow play that we're cast in
On the cabin walls

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You were floating to me
In a slow-motion fade
Could I finally see
Between belief and faith?

[Chorus]
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you, you?
When am I gonna lose

I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you

[Chorus]
When am I gonna lose
When am I gonna lose you
When am I gonna lose you, you
When am I gonna lose2Embed
