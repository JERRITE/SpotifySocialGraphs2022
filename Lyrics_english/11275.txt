Pretty Flamingo Lyrics[Verse 1]
On our block
All of the guys call her Flamingo
'Cause her hair glows like the sun
And her eyes can light the skies

[Verse 2]
When she walks
She moves so fine like a flamingo
Crimson dress that clings so tight
She's out of reach and out of sight
[Bridge]
When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh, every guy would make her his
If he just could, if she just would

[Verse 3]
Some sweet day
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

[Flute Solo]
(Pretty flamingo)
(Pretty flamingo)

[Bridge]
When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh, every guy would make her his
If he just could, ha, if she just would

[Verse 4]
Some sweet day
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be
You might also like[Outro]
Sha-la-la, la-la-la-la, pretty flamingo
Someday, I'll make her mine
Sha-la-la, la-la-la-la, pretty flamingo
Yes I will, yes I will, I'll make her mine...1Embed
