Sorry Iâ€™m Not Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to play with pretty things
Now I burn them up in flames
Not gonna be no beauty queen
Don't need to ride in no limousine

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?
Does this make me unlovable?
If I don't fit your description
Will you force-feed me your prescription?
[Chorus]
Not gonna lay in this bed
Sorry I'm not dead
Gonna make your head spin, oh
Time to even the score
I'm kicking down the door
Screaming out your stereo
Won't take it no more

[Post-Chorus]
(Won't take it no more, no more)
(Won't take it no more)

[Verse 2]
I'm not one for petty games
Not bowing down for misogynist ways
I'd rather be a corpse on the floor
Than be your dolled up dirty little whore

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?
Does this make me unlovable?
If I don't fit your description
Will you force-feed me your prescription?

[Chorus]
Not gonna lay in this bed
Sorry I'm not dead
Gonna make your head spin, oh
Time to even the score
I'm kicking down the door
Screaming out your stereo
Won't take it no more

If you want a war
What you waiting for?
No, I won't be ignored
If you want a war
What you waiting for?
No, I won't be, won't be ignored

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?
Does this make me unlovable?
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?
Does this make me unlovable?

[Chorus]
Not gonna lay in this bed
Sorry I'm not dead
Gonna make your head spin, oh
Time to even the score
I'm kicking down the door
Screaming out your stereo
Won't take it no more

[Outro]
Won't take it no more
Won't take it no more
Won't take it no more
Won't take it no more
Won't take it no more
Won't take it no moreEmbed
