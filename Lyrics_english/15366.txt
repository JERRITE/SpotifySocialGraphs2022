Omission Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)

[Verse 1]
Omit myself as a favor for God
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Suffer fate 'cause it's the only lift you've got
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Dedicating all of before to now
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Emphasizing these things you won't allow
[Chorus 1]
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)

[Verse 1]
Omit myself as a favor for God
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Supper fate 'cause it's the only lift you got
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Dedicating all of before to now
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Emphasizing these things you won't allow

[Bridge]
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life I take my cover
(Echoing what is not)
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life we take our cover
(Echoing what is not)

[Chorus 2]
Going nowhere (Take myself from your eyes)
Going nowhere (Take myself from your eyes)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Going nowhere's the only clear shot
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
At being somewhere the fates think you're not
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Somewhere's whole to divide any way you want
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Faking now, faking who you are

[Bridge]
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life I'll take my cover
(Echoing what is not)
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life we'll take our cover
(Echoing what is not)

[Outro]
Never now I need the other
(And if you're suffering a lot)
In your life we take our cover
(Try being someone you're not)
Never now I need the other
(And if you're suffering a lot)
In your life I'll take good cover
(Try being someone you're not)5Embed
