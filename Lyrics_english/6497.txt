Turn It Up Lyrics[Intro: Oliver Tree]
Little Big

Oliver Tree
Turn it up

[Verse 1: Oliver Tree]
Turn it up, get the stereo blastin'
Dance moves like Michael Jackson
Wanna see it let loose, get crackin'
I don't see no freak, no action
Turn it up, get the stereo blastin'
Let me see what's the main attraction
Fancy footwork, no tappin'
Crank it up 'til the bass is slappin'
[Chorus: Little Big]
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Tommy Cash]
I'm 'bout to hit that coochie (Aga)
Play you like Tamagotchi (Aga)
Gonna get the price of blue cheese (Aga)
All dipped in something bougie
Wear Prada, Louis, Gucci
I'm rollin' Nombe sushi
Модель сосёт в джакузи
Spray haters with my Uzi

[Chorus: Little Big]
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Sonya & Oliver Tree]
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up in the air
Then you dance, ah, then you dance, ah
Shake your ass like you don't care
In the nightclub, in the nightclub
People dancing everywhere
Let's go dumb, let's go dumb
Shake your ass like no one's there
You might also like[Chorus: Little Big]
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, I wanna make some noise
I wanna make some more, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook: Oliver Tree, Little Big & Tommy Cash]
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it up, up
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it up, up
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it up, up
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it up, up
