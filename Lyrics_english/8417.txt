Real until death, he heard, baby?
The phone (OH-OH-OH, OH-OH) does not respond
She doesn't even answer the 'text' (OH-OH-OH, OH-OH, OH-OH)

Baby, I need your 'text' (Illuminati, you heard, baby?)

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Casper Magic]
What happened that I don't see you? (I see you)
One day 'you are here and the other loyal' (Uah-Uah)
He plays' with my mind and I dizzy (dizziness)
I am a prisoner and of your body I am a prisoner, I!
What happens that I don't see you? (-EO)
One day you are here and the other lEJO '(Uah-Uah)
He plays' with my mind and I dizzy (dizziness)
I am imprisoned, from your jail I am a inmate, I!
Uah-uah (real until death, he heard, baby?)

Another day I woke up without you
Like crazy because you are not here
From my 'error' I already regretted
And what I promised, it was for yourself that I did not comply
To eat you whole I have to 'the Tip
My heart seeks you, apparently you made an R.I.P. (AH)
Sorry for the vece 'that I pretended
Now you were you who booted me, Yeh-eh

No matter how much I do not understand what happened to you
Tell me if another your heart stole me
He fell in love, now I have to forget you
But your memory follows me at all 'part' (uah-uah)

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Casper Magic]
What happened that I don't see you? (I see you)
One day 'you are here and the other loyal' (and the other loyal ')

I am a prisoner and of your body I am a prisoner, I!
What happens that I don't see you? (Nosotro 'somo' the magic ', baby; I see you)
One day you are here and the other loyal '(and the other lEJO'; Casper!)
He plays' with my mind and I dizzy (I dizzy)
I am imprisoned, from your jail I am a inmate (Uah-Uah)
