Will You Still Love Me? (Alternate Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Take me as I am
Put your hand in mine now and forever (Forever)
Darling here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more
[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own (My own)

[Verse 2: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
Because I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove
There was you
You and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on (Can't go on)
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on
If I'm on my own
I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)

[Outro: Bill Champlin, (Peter Cetera)]
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be aloneEmbed
