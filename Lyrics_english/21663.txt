River city lights LyricsI met her down In Tennessee
She went by the name of Amelie
She was a character anyone could see
She had eyes just for me

Time will fly and the summer would end
And I will never see her again
And I hear thunder in my head
When I wonder where she is

And the river runs
Through a town
And all of the stars out
They’re out tonight
She’s up on the rooftop
Lookin’ down
Just staring at the river lit up with the city lights
And I roll on years gone by
The sun goes down on another sky
And there is no where I’d rather be
And there is no one I’d rather see

Where the river runs
Through a town
And all the stars out
Out tonight
She’s up on a rooftop
Lookin’ down
Just starin’ down at the river with the city lights

I shouldn’t have been so torn up inside
From losing what is hard to find
But that’s just the way
The way it goes sometimes
The way it goes sometimesYou might also likeEmbed
