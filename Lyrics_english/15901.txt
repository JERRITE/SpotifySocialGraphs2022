I saw you come lyrics [lyrics by "I saw you come"]

[Verse 1]
I don't even have you
And I'm afraid of losing you, love
How fast it has been nailed to me
What in all this pain
It is little that I know you
And I already put the whole game in your favor
I am not afraid of betting
Lose if I am dreadful
[Pre-car]
I have no more shelter that fantasy
I don't have to do a poetry anymore

[Chorus]
Because I saw you coming and I didn't hesitate
I saw you coming and I hugged you
And I put all my passion for you to stay
And then I kissed you and risked with the truth
I stroked you, and finally I opened my heart for you to pass
My love gave you without condition for you to stay

[Verse 2]
Now I will wait a few days
To see if what I gave you was enough
You don't know what terror you feel
Waiting for every morning
If you no longer want to go back
The sense of love would be lost forever
I would not understand this world
I would get away from people

[Pre-car]
I have no more shelter that fantasy
I don't have to do a poetry anymore

Because I saw you coming and I didn't hesitate
I saw you coming and I hugged you
And I put all my passion for you to stay
And then I kissed you and risked with the truth
I stroked you, and finally I opened my heart for you to pass
My love gave you without condition for you to stay
My love gave you without condition for you to stay
My love gave you without condition for you to stay
