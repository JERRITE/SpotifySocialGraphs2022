Dreaming (The Chainsmokers Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see the place that we belong together, together
Like we were something more
And it felt like maybe we could last forever, forever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you led 'em to our hideout
Forced their way inside, now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender
But I could go all night right here
Between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send the message
We're saying "give it up, give it up"
[Hook]
We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
Please God tell me we're dreaming

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Hook]
Please God tell me we're dreaming

[Verse 2]
Wait for the dust to settle down around us, around us
And stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again, to breathe again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath and calm down
Cause you have been selected, you've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you've got your nest egg, you've got your nest egg
So live it up, live it up!

We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Hook]
Please God tell me we're dreaming
Please God tell me we're dreaming
Please God tell me we're dreaming

[Bridge]
We've got no place to go
We've got nowhere to run
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
Dreaming

Please God tell me we're dreaming

[Post-Hook]
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
Please God tell me we're dreaming1Embed
