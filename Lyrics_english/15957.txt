I run, flight and accelerate Lyricshoy I wake up with a fast jump
The shock that gives me emotion
Does a new heart premiere?
For you for me for two

I leave the bed with a fast jump
I turn on the radio to hear rock
And I prepare to go looking for a coffee jeans nothing more

I run, I accelerate
To be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire of love)
I run to be with you (next to you)
I run, I accelerate
To be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire of love)
I run to be with you

Today each street looks much better
Why my course takes direction
You appeared and my life changed
For you for me for two

And I see you again with the same emotion
With you, my heart beats strong
Don't wake me up if it's a dream of love
Let me sleep is better

I run, I accelerate
To be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire of love)
I run to be with you (next to you)

I run, I accelerate to be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire of love)
I run to be with you

I wake up the clock
To say that the dream ends
And that school waiting for me
Without your love the cruel reality

I run, I accelerate
To be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire of love)
I run to be with you (next to you)

I run, I accelerate
To be with you
And start the game
And light the fire of love (fire fire) embed
