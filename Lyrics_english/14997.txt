Let It Roll Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where'd you get to? Where'd you go?
I've been so lost since you left
Wish you kept leading me on
Tried to reach ya, tried to call
I bang my head against your door
But there ain't nobody home

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind
[Chorus]
So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone

[Verse 2]
If you think you might feel the same
I'll be right here where we left off
Same old story, same old place
I won't wander, I won't let go
'Cause there's more life in my bones
Than you give me credit for

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
And if you want, we can wait behind
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind

[Chorus]
So, I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again

You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go
You don't need to lose control, I just wanna let you know
I'm holding on to make you whole, don't let go, don't let go

[Chorus]
I'm holding out for something more
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll again
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let it roll, let it roll, let me hold your heart of stone6Embed
