Monument LyricShow is the light of my dreamed dream
The fire of effort is increasingly increasing
I paint the picture

'You do not deal with the pain of emotion
Do you fall in heaven
You look like an angel without being as good
Puzzle why
But however
Love is so mysterious
Little stone, a little cement
'Still dissatisfied
To show love to you. And it looks like a saint in the convent. Star star in the story
You idol, I have a high hand to you
You are the great, percentage. Let me build you…

Mento, mento, mento
Mo-monument
Mento, mento, mento

With so much I have a lot of furiousness
What I have to do is…
Just in the precinct to explain. It's good to be pure even when the frequency is short
'You are not just smiling

Seems like a dream
Don't wake up to sleep. Extremely thoughtful
Dedma on Bad Trip
Love is another class

Little stone, a little cement
'Still dissatisfied
To show love to you. And it looks like a saint in the convent. Star star in the story
You idol, I have a high hand to you
You are the great, percentage. Let me build you…
Of the monument
You might also likesa every corner, corner and rotonda
Watch out, no contradiction ...

Little stone, a little cement
'Still dissatisfied
To show love to you. And it looks like a saint in the convent. Star star in the story
You idol, I have a high hand to you
You are the great, percentage. Let me build you…
In EDSA, Caloocan or Luneta. Wherever I build you…
