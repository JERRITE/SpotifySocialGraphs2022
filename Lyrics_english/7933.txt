My Pony Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't you hold back, you should know that
I like the way you move
You're so invitin', I'm decidin'
That I will leave with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at you in that dress
You got the things I want
Oh, you're so dangerous
I'm longing for your touch
Love how you take control
When you're on top of me
So won't you take me there?
'Cause I know what you need, oh yeah
[Chorus]
If you want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on it
Do it, ride it, come on, jump on it

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Don't you slow down in the first round
As you, you hold the reins, oh yeah
You're hypnotizin', I'm testifyin'
Girl, you, you drive me insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at you in that dress
You got the things I want
Oh, you're so dangerous
But I'm longin' for your touch
Love how you take control
When you're on top of me
So won't you take me there?
'Cause I know what you need, oh yeah

[Chorus]
If you want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on it
Do it, ride it, come on, jump on it
You might also like[Drop]
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
If you want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it (Let's do it), ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come on, jump on itEmbed
