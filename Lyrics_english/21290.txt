Been There Lately Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heaven raise an eye, I'm comin' home
Seedy and crawlin'
Seven years or more, now they know
Where I'm goin'

[Pre-Chorus]
A beautiful shade of blue and pale
A color you bought at a junkie's yard sale
Stop your cryin', stop your cryin'
Well, I'm lazy now
The summer crazy farm is all I own with...
[Chorus]
My motor, my thrills, I needed my space (Yes I did)
My prison, my drugs, let's go to my place (Come on)
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately, there's no room

[Verse 2]
Now, listen
Well, I sacrificed the all the people that were killin' me
And since gone away
Three of them murdered, two livin'
Now, even God's gone
That's life in L.A., yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a day you wanna come by
Everybody knows I'll just be sittin' there
Drop on by, now
Let's get high, now
The Reverend reminding me:
Your redemption can be paid with...

[Chorus]
My motor, my thrills, I needed my space
My prison, my drugs, let's go to my place
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately, there's no room
No, no

(Ain't been there lately)
(Ain't been there lately)
(Ain't been there lately)
Lately

[Chorus]
Well
My motor, my thrills, I needed my space (Yeah, now)
And my prison, my drugs, let's go to my place (C'mon, now)
And my motor, my thrills, I needed my space (Oh, no)
My prison, my drugs, let's go to my place (C'mon)
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately
Ain't been there lately, 'cause there's no room
