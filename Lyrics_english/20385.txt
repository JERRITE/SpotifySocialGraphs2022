TranslationsPortuguÃªsTurn Off the Lights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got so sick of being on my own
Now the devil won't leave me alone
It's almost like I've found a friend
Who's in it for the bitter end
Our consciences are always so much heavier
Than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

[Pre-Chorus]
So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time?
[Chorus]
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not

[Verse 2]
Got so sick of wasting all my time
How in God's name did I survive?
(How did I survive?) I need a little sympathy
Disarm my insecurities
Our consciences are always so much heavier
Than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

[Pre-Chorus]
So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time?

[Chorus]
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not
You might also like(Oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
A heavy heart on the boulevard tonight, oh
Shooting stars, watch me fall apart tonight
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart, my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I've got
Like the man I know I'm not

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh...15Embed
