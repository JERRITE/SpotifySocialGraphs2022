Give it Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Someday, I'll let you in
Treat you right, drive you outta your mind, ooh
You never met a chick like me
Burn so bright, I'm gonna make you blind

[Pre-Chorus 1: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Always want what you can't have
Is it so bad if you don't get what you wanted?
Make you feel good, as I whip you into shape
Yeah, boy, let's get it started
[Chorus: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Give it up, you can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame you don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play at the end of the night
It's the same old story, but you never get it right
Give it up

[Post-Chorus: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Come a little closer, baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
So stop trying to walk away
No, you won't ever leave me behind
No, you better believe that I'm here to stay (that's right)
'Cause you're the shade and I'm the sunshine, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Look at me boy, 'cause I got you where I want you
Isn't it so exciting?
Wanna shake you, wanna break you
Take a backseat boy, 'cause now I'm driving

[Chorus: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Give it up, you can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame you don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play at the end of the night
It's the same old story, but you never get it right
Give it up

Come a little closer
Come a little closer, baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer, baby, baby
Come a little closer
Come a little closer, baby
Yeah, you are my baby and I'll make you crazy tonight, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Look at me boy, 'cause I got you where I want you
Isn't it so exciting?
Wanna shake you, wanna break you
Take a backseat boy, 'cause now I'm driving

[Chorus: Elizabeth Gillies & Ariana Grande]
Give it up, you can't win
'Cause I know where you've been
Such a shame you don't put up a fight
That's a game that we play at the end of the night
It's the same old story, but you never get it right
Give it up, oh, yeah9Embed
