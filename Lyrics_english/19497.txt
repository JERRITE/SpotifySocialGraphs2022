Yes / Yes
Only for you

I call you if that's okay (yes, yes)

[Part 1: UFO361]
Baby, say how long do you stay here? (EY)
Yes, I love to be high with you (ey)
No, I don't want to argue with you, no (no, no)
No, we are not allowed to lose time, no, no
I'm faded, yes, happens, baby, stay here
Is that really real? Yes, I'm so confused myself (yes)
Yes, you ask me every day what becomes of us (yes)
Far too many words, nothing that touches me (no, yes, yes)

[Bridge: Ufo361]
Take another SIP of the poison
Because I fuck me that you are still not here (still not here)
