Love The Way You Lie (Remix) LyricsOne second she's hatin'
Then she says she's in love
I'm just thinking is she Satan
Or sent from above
Well if she's angel
She's the type that takes off the halo
There it goes
And suddenly I'm the a-hole
She's says she'll do better
I'm like Ok Go
Here it goes again
We pretend that we're walking away
But we're here still
Like we're on treadmills
Relationship status written in pencil
It's easily erased
And changed
Never stays the same
For too long
It should be easy for me to move on
But this isn't black and white
It's got more than two tones
This feeling is too strong
Even when we do wrong to each other
I keep thinking we'll recover
I don't need to find another
My mind's like damn this is getting so old
It's just not in cards, but my heart won't fold
[Hook]

Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieYou might also likeEmbed
