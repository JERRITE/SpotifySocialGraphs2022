Chasing Rabbits Lyrics[Intro: Jefferson Airplane sample]
One pill makes you larger and
One pill makes you small and
The ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
Go chasing rabbits

[Verse 1: Eazy Mac]
Purple haze and acid rain drops (rain drops)
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (drink pop)
Find Chance the Rapper at the after hours
Wearing a Toronto Raptors Jersey at that Drake spot
Feeling wavy now-a-days, my brain's gone
Colors keep on changin' and they ain't stoppin' (ain't stoppin')
Lean over the sink get my face washed
I'm too hot
Even in the winter wearing tank tops (I'm 2Pac)
[Chorus]
One pill makes you larger and
One pill makes you small and
The ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
Go chasing rabbits

[Verse 2: Merkules]
Chasing rabbits playing Madden in a Jason mask
Take a dab to the forsaken land
Waving a Mason flag (Mason flag)
I'm just talkin' hella gibberish
And that's not a reference to Eazy (Lil' Bitch)
So take a hike and put acid tabs in your Maxipads
Cop a fanny pack and act like half these cats who battle rap
My tunes dope, heavy haymakers like sumos
This verse is Vinnie Paz with a semi-mag and a Doom flow
I'm out of here

[Chorus]
One pill makes you larger and
One pill makes you small and
The ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
Go chasing rabbits

[Verse 3: Eazy Mac]
Watch your step, you might trip into your feelings
Devil's paint drippin' from the ceilings
I get high for science , Lucy in the sky with diamonds
I been chasing rabbits and tasting tabs trying to find it
Now there's gloom in my eyes
Never mind, I think the room's come alive
It's a feeling only you can describe
When the lude's and the lucy and music collide
You might also like[Chorus]
One pill makes you larger and
One pill makes you small and
The ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
Go chasing rabbits1Embed
