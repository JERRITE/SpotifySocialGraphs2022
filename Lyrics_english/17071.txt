Nameless Lyrics[Intro]
Tell her she just wanna be friends with me
Goose with another one
Keed, talk to 'em

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Girl, can you take it?
Yeah, she take dick
Never runnin’, take it
Body right, fitness
More than a mistress
She made me miss it
She just wanted Lil Keed (Let's go, let's go)
I don’t know her whole name
I just met her one day
And I gave her a nickname
And I changed the whole scenery (Let's go, let's go)
Fucked her one time, she can't stop calling me (Brr)
[Verse 1]
Take off your clothes, when I hit the light, you know it get real
I get in that pussy, you know what I do
I bend her ass up, she know what I do, yeah
Diamonds dancing, Michael Jackson, yeah
Come in with these racks, she dance like Prancer, yeah
We could go all night on Percocet pills
Bitch, I'm balling, yeah, right out the gym
I don't ho hog, I'm passin' these hoes just like the ball
Yes, ball, passin’ these hoes just like the team
Passin’ these hoes just off the strip
I'm hiring these hoes just like a temp
Carry these poles, yeah, we chop a limb
Color wrong, nigga, and they pull out a camera
This is a movie they know they can film
I’m not a character, no, not a Simpson
I want a whole lotta M&M's
She talk 'bout a nigga, ain't real as him

[Chorus]
I told her
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Girl, can you take it?
Yeah, she take dick
Never runnin’, take it
Body right, fitness
More than a mistress
She made me miss it
She just wanted Lil Keed (Let's go, let's go)
I don't know her whole name
I just met her one day
And I gave her a nickname
And I changed the whole scenery (Let's go, let's go)
Fucked her one time, she can't stop calling me (Brr)

She say she want some young slime love
Pull up on her gang with the i8 doors up
Yeah, pull up on her gang with them racks in the cut
She want me to take my chains off, I said "No, I'm in a rush"
She told me to close my eyes, she got a surprise for me
Yeah, and she see that AMG chain shining
And she see this YSL chain shining
I can't tell the time on the watch 'cause diamonds blinding me
Hope you know your bitch just love me
Yeah, she got on her knees, put some work in
Hennessy in her system, yeah, she workin'
She want some money every time she get that work in

[Chorus]
I told her
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Girl, can you take it?
Yeah, she take dick
Never runnin', take it
Body right, fitness
More than a mistress
She made me miss it
She just wanted Lil Keed (Let's go, let's go)
I don't know her whole name
I just met her one day
And I gave her a nickname
And I changed the whole scenery (Let's go, let's go)
Fucked her one time, she can't stop calling me (Brr)18Embed
