Mr. Flamboyant Lyrics[Intro: E-40]
Yeah, I'm just a hustler on the go
Out here gettin' my propers don't ya know
I'm livin' kind of comfortable, large mail and all yeah
And a jealous motherfucker would love to see me fall
Like that, that

[Unknown Gangster Voice]
When we sell this load
We'll have twice what we started with
[E-40 talking]
Yeah, this that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank Cognac lounge beat
Cognac lounge beat, motherfucker
Cognac lounge beat, mother- motherfucker
Yeah, this that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank Cognac lounge beat
Mr. Flamboyant, motherfucker
M-M-Mr. Flamboyant, motherfucker

[Verse 1: E-40]
As a youngster I never knew nothin'
That disobedient ass child in your neighborhood
You know the one the police was always chasin'
Straight down and dirty for my props
Eleven years old, extra-manish, hard-headed sellin' rocks
I carried a powerful ass motherfuckin' oversized toy that was hella bigger than me
Prettiest thing I ever seen, a 1979 AR-15
Clean, fully automatic and the whole killer kit
As far as me walkin' up and down the street
Folks be pointin' they fingers talkin' "Partner gotta grip"
Well actually what I was doin' was protectin' my people's million dollar spots
It was my duty, I got paid to guard the whole motherfuckin' block
Try and catch me if you can, now that I’m a grown man, though
The mail I got stashed away, people will never know
Mr. Flamboyant

I came in here on business
I-I-I came in here on business
It could work out pretty good
It could work out pretty good

[Interlude: B-Legit]
Yeah pertainin' to this bein' a dog ass world and all
A brother need some kind of occupaton to make his mail stand tall
Whether it's slangin' 'em or whatever ya do man
Just make sure you true to the game

[Verse 2: E-40]
Still in the game everything pretty much the same
Tryna reach a certain goal, but I gotta ditch that there metro
Alcohol and Tobacco Bureau, Feds and the DEA
Yeah, just don't run up on me when I'm off that there Grand-Mariner
Well, what if they blast you and slap yo ass in the trunk
Partner, if this was fifth all of us would be drunk
Don't even like righteously trip off your petty punk shit like that
What is you sayin' brother
They might be talkin' 'bout hot ones to the back
Meanwhile, bootsee was comin' around the corner on two shoes
I mean wheels
Scattin’ in a '76 Cutlass Oldsmobile (Muthafucka!)
Turnin' 360s like he was an Alaskan mobile
Sittin' on gold ones, hot flamin' and didn't really know the deal
I said "What in the fuck wrong with you, you crazy ass motherfucker?"
Partner back there tried to mean mug me and turn two tight ones  like I was a sucker
So slow ya lil' ass down on this here side of town
'Fore you find yourself melted or either beat down
[Interlude: B-Legit]
Like that and that's on the gooch my brother
Because nowadays a dollar comes harder than a motherfucker
So if you out in that world don't get caught or be slippin'
'Cause today's society ain't trippin'

[Singing]
Ah hay Ah hay Ah hay
Ah hay Ah hay Ah hay
Yeah

[Unknown Gangster Voice]
There's a fortune in this business
There's a-there's a fortune in this business

[Verse 3: E-40]
Mr. Flamboyant, yeah that just might be yo name
The center of attention, money, fame
Fucking with a bitch's brains, a player, insane
Leader of the squad, much yola, a gang
See, he throws the whole unit in a big ass gumbo pot
Foam stir, let it settle then make it locked
You can like righteously tell a real swing when he's about his mail
Sparked the overkill, five hundred grams extra
Pertainin' to the triple beam scale
Solid as a rock, white white white
A-1 peep pistol plan
Nothin' of that scandalous ass cakin' with baking soda
Whether you know it or not here's a dog's game
You gotta watch your back and play it well
Way too many brothers get took for large sums of mail
You can't be frail and don't be light in ya narrow ass
Gain some weight
Drink beer with potatoes and gravy, it's not too late
Become a savage, get swole but once, 20-inch arms establish
One hitter quitters, the whole get down, don't run up on me now

[Interlude: B-Legit]
Uh, E, why you come at 'em like that man
You know they can't understand that shit
When you doin' about a buck fifty man
But now put that shit in perspective for 'em though

[E-40]
Ey, check this out my sohab
Due to the fact that I am at liberty
To release such valuable information towards the public
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Every last one of my sohabs been hollerin' at me
Demandin' that I define the definition of Mr. Flamboyant
Pertainin' to me havin' inherited the gift to spit
So I had to like let loose

[B-Legit]
Like that, well ya know the shit is good listenin' man
But now I want you to go back to the tune
You was doin' earlier in that song
You know that lil' tune ya was doin'

[E-40]
Oh yeah
You mean this right here:
Yeah, I'm just a hustler on the go
Out here gettin' my propers, don't ya know
I'm livin' kind of comfortable, large mail and all
And a lot of jealous fellas would love to see me fall
