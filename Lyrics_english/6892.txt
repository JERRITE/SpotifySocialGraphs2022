The Ones Who Never Flew Lyrics[Chorus]
There's no easy way to say this
It's time to build my doom
The nest is only for the vultures
And the ones who never flew
So I think you deserve some quiet
It’s been long since you heard silence
And I know you can’t stand my riots
So thank you for your guidance

[Verse]
Get me out of this place
I just need the car without the brakes
Cuz I'm not sure on what I'm looking for
But I know I can not stay
And I gotta get away
Nah don't say that you feel me, uh
You don't feel the pain inside my stomach when I sleep, uh
So much of this anger that I might as well turn green, uh
My friends say they like me but they talk behind the scenes, uh
They say I'm a lame, uh
They say I'm a goat, uh
I don't really care I do the most so here's a toast, uh
I can do the Casper if I want to and go ghost, uh
Heard your girlfriend like me
Come and smoke me, I’m the dope, uh
Parents never cared, no, they love to check my mail, uh
Just last week a girl from UConn sent me underwear, uh
Swear I need to ditch this bitch, my sanity is teared, uh
I don't know 'bout you, but living here just isn't fair
[Chorus]
There's no easy way to say this
It's time to build my doom
The nest is only for the vultures
And the ones who never flew
So I think you deserve some quiet
It’s been long since you heard silence
And I know you can’t stand my riots
So thank you for your guidanceYou might also likeEmbed
