[Pre-Caro: Baby Rasta & Don Omar]
And she contradicts (Au)
Do it in the car and do it in bed
Accompanies me in the room
She deceives me (Baby Rasta!)
With the role of a healthy girl
He liked more than the boyfriend and smokes marijuana (the king!)
She loves you to passionate
That they touch her, to kiss her by the neck
And that pulls her by hair
She tells me that I don't get out of her head
Well, I'm the only man who best kisses her

[Choir: Baby Rasta, Chencho & Don Omar]
She wants, eh-eh
That define love (remix), sex and betrayal
While I, oh-oh
I forget the notion of time, I feel that I lose control (Plan B)
And she wants, eh-eh
That define love, sex and betrayal
While I, oh-oh
I forget the notion of time, I feel that I lose control

[Verse 1: Don Omar]
(DO-DON, DON)
She has a boyfriend, but it's obvious
That he liked it, then dances me
As if we met a lot
He gave me his number and vo 'to call without perse
If tomorrow wants to see me where there is not so much public (change)
Where there is protection, I'm looking for a room
And Enrolo a Blunt and puts a song
That "I feel ill of love"
Pa 'dance permanent, permanent, permanent
Permanent, permanent
Permanent, permanent and then to make love

[Bridge: Chencho Corleone]
Since I saw you that day

Go to me to 'a night
For me to fulfill your fantasies

[Verse 2: Syko]
Te-you, you saw dancing on the album
And it is seen that Ere 'Candela Pura
You show, do not hide and the sewing breaks
Sexy rhythm breaks waist
Prefers in the dark corner
Says that Syko heals the pains to his figure
That model of modeling is bastard
Take a little, do me beautiful to check the mahon
I know that you're looking for me for a long time
If you are on fire I am on fire and today it fell to '

[Verse 3: Kendo Kaponi]
It contradicts when he says
"I drink, I love that you talk to me in the ear
To feel that my skin is erected
While we do we talk
And in the end you always tell me
How rich, kendo, you are a Bacano
Bacano? No, my love, the dura tell me
Today I go to your cat that goes down the taco
She wants them to define her, the love of sex and betrayal
While I lose the notion of time
And I feel that I lose control

Since I saw you that day

Go to me to 'a night

For me to fulfill your fantasies

[Verse 4: gringo]
That is your role (role)
You have me in uncontrol
Give him, mommy, advance and turn on the engine
I'm already hot (-lor)
Let's go alone in the dining room
You already know that I will be your best competitor
It feels, feels
As the rhythm makes me wrap me and stick to you the tooth '
You tired 'and the routine and you want something different
Don't you know that I am? Mommy, I'm your insane
