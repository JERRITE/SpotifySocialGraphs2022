Paralyzing lyrics ["paralyzing" letter "]

[Verse 1: Susana Cala & Bacillos]
I want to think that for our love it is not too late
I could see what difficult me ​​did not work for me, no, no
And although it has not been easy, I come regretful
With the voice so fragile and a little game in two
And although it was not my intention, no

[Chorus: Susana Cala & Bacillos]
Today I am clear that you and me
We rhyme better than any song
Love you is a Saturday afternoon
I understood too late
I promise that I will shout
For every time I hid my voice
Because I loved anyone without telling anyone
I was too late
[Post-car: Bacillos, Susana Cala, both]
Hey, ey, you and me, the best combination
Your paralyzing mouth, it guarantees me that
You and me (and me), the best combination
Your paralyzing mouth, it guarantees me that

[Verse 2: Susana Cala & Bacillos]
Ey, how combines stars and cold
How well combine your eyes with mine
And even if I have no case call you
I don't want to see the glass half empty
I know it will be worth it
And although waiting for you burning
I have the world upside down
If you fix if you see me
I know it will be worth it
Although waiting for you burning
I want to make you understand (that)

[Chorus: Susana Cala, Bacillos, both]
Today I am clear that you and me
We rhyme better than any song
Love you is a Saturday afternoon
I understood too late
I promise that I will shout
For every time I hid my voice
Because I loved you without telling anyone
I understood too late
