Damage Dealt Lyrics[Intro]
I'll ride in the coupe
Bro, what the fuck?
Damn, you love me but you don't (You don't)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Damn, you love me but you don't
Lying to yourself
Lying to me bitch, sayin' why I want to deal
All the damage dealt
I ain't give a shit about you, no more necessary
I ain't really care about my life, fuck that it's hell
Rather live in hell than live in this depth
Fuck, ugh
[Post-Chorus]
I don't really know you, baby
But I really wanna get to know you
And I really wanna show you all these drugs in the back
Forty running on my sack
Yeah (yeah)
(Yeh-yeh)

[Verse]
I ain't give a fuck about you bitch
I ain't barely know that
I ain't riding with the flack
Got a coolie on the slat
Fuckin' bitches and it's wack
(Yeh-yeh)

[Chorus]
Damn, you love me but you don't
Lying to yourself
Lying to me bitch, sayin' why I want to deal
All the damage dealt
I ain't give a shit about you, no more necessary
I ain't really care about my life, fuck that it's hell
Rather live in hell than live in this depth
Fuck, ugh

I don't really know you, baby
But I really wanna get to know you
And I really wanna show you all these drugs in the back
Forty running on my sack
Yeah, yeah
(Yeh-yeh)Embed
