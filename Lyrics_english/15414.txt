Shore Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I were you, I wouldn't answer it at all
It's a late November mornin' and I'll be comin' home
For a little while, I couldn't shake them
But the trail I left was strong

[Chorus]
We can leave them waitin', nervous
'Cause I know

[Verse 2]
If I were you, I wouldn't answer the door
It's 2 AM, I'm lookin' down the street
But silence has eyes for her
[Chorus]
Sleepin' while you replace me, safety turned off
We can leave them waitin', nervous
'Cause I know, know, know, yеah

[Refrain]
And we made them nеrvous 'cause I know they're listenin'
We make them nervous on the phone, on the phone
We made them nervous 'cause I know they're listenin'
We make them nervous on the phone, on the phone

[Outro]
If I can't escape your hold, just let me go
Let me have this mutiny
And I won't lose this time, reclaiming my night
'Til the streets run red
I won't let you choose when I die
Regressin' on the dial
If I'm gon' lose my mind, just let me go
And let me have this mutinyYou might also likeEmbed
