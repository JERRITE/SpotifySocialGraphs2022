[Intro]
Lele Pons

[Verse 1]
Don't look for a lawsuit, so forget it
You can play with others, but not with me
If you go out of line, it's better than running
And better rely on God, goodbye
[Verse 2]
Have careful 'if you have' another skirt
I discover that, and those that come out
The look always betrays you
I don't like cheap people

[Pre-car]
So don't come with your word
Much immaturity in you is what I see
I put my hands for you in the fire
And you were wrong ugly

[Chorus]
In the 'good', and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah
I was always there for you
In the 'good', and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah, ah
You were not there for me
There was rain in my eyes, now stay alone
In the 'good' and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah, ah
Daddy, you can go
Go for the
Go for the
Go for the

[Verse 3]
I have a witch friend, and another spy
The other works in the CIA
Take care 'Who do you go out in the photo
Do not mess with the dangerous combo
And if it dawns and you don't appear '
You are punishing, you deserve it
You can't with one at a time
Just a stupid makes that stupidity

So don't come with your word
Much immaturity in you is what I see

[Chorus]
In the 'good', and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah
I was always there for you
In the 'good', and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah, ah
You were not there for my
There was rain in my eyes, now stay alone
In the 'good' and in the 'bad', ah, ah-ah, ah
Daddy you can go
Go for the
Go for the
Go for the

[Outro]
You can go, far from here
I told you, go pa 'the
You can go, far from here
