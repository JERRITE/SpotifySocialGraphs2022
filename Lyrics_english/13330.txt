Everything Was Beautiful Lyrics[Intro]
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
(La la la...)
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la
(La la la...)

[Verse]
Crush it, cut it, cook it, hook it up, put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth, boy
Crush it, cut it, cook it, hook it up, put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth, boy
[Bridge]
It was just like a movie. The Eiffel Tower looked better than the postcards, I met a man from Le Marais who took me skiing for the first time. He said he was an agent, and he told me I was more beautiful than all models he's seen. I could hear Dancing Queen playing and girls screaming through the door and all the bathroom tiles looked like glass candy. Everything was beautiful

[Outro]
Everything was beautiful
Everything was beautiful
Everything was beautiful
Everything was beautiful
Everything was beautiful
