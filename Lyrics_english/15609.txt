Lyrics pastel pink ["pastel pink"]

[Verse 1: denisse]
Yes, I wanted to be that woman
The mother of your children
And together walk to the altar
Straight to death

[Pre-car: Denisse]
And in the end, not even talk
We both destroy
And in the end, how are you?
You and I no longer exist
[Chorus: Denisse]
No, I don't want to be, that woman
She went to an abyss
And you are not the one who promised
It would be my superhero
And what, everything ended, there is no more
We will be two strangers
I will forget you, you will forget
see you never

[Verse 2: denisse]
And where was it, that button
What leads to happiness?
Honeymoon, pastel pink
Clich√©s and nonsense

[Pre-car: Denisse]
And in the end, not even talk
We both destroy
And in the end, how are you?
You and I no longer exist

[Chorus: Denisse]
No, I don't want to be, that woman
She went to an abyss
And you are not the one who promised
It would be my superhero
And what, everything ended, there is no more
We will be two strangers
I will forget you, you will forget
see you never
