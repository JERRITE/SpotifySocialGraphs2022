TranslationsPortuguêsDeutschItalianoSudden Desire Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanted him to kiss me how
With open mouth and open mouth
We keep our distance now
I wanna feel his hands go down
I try not to think about
What happened last night outside his house
Too far to go back now
Just wanna feel his hands go down

[Refrain]
Sudden
Sudden desi—
Sudden
Sudden desi—
A sudden desire
[Verse 2]
Take the elephant by the hand and hold it
It's cruel to tame a thing that don't know its strength
But better to walk beside it
Than underneath
My kind companion
Softened stone
My gentle giant
Painful reminder

[Chorus]
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Don't know if I can deny (Sudden)
A sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Your fingerprints on my skin
A painful reminder
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
A sudden desire

[Bridge]
Won't fit in the room, big balloon
Trails me 'cause I can't let go
Everywhere I am, it sticks close like a friend
Just like him
Just like him
Friendly reminder of a sudden desire
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Don't know if I can deny (Sudden)
A sudden desire (Sudden desire)
Your fingerprints on my skin
A painful reminder
Don't look in my eyes (Sudden)
I feel a sudden desire (Sudden desire)
A sudden desire

[Outro]
I wanted him to kiss me how
With open mouth and open mouth
We keep our distance now
I wanna feel his hand go down
I try not to think about
What happened last night outside his house
Too far to go back now
Just wanna feel his hands go down5Embed
