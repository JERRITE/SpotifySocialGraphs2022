[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro]
When you start
I hope you never finish '
Because whenever you kiss me
The gardens flourish
But the sun went and never returned
I felt like a child without light, with fear
This fairy tale at the end changed
He filled me with promises that he never fulfilled
[Pre-stribe: Rauw Alejandro]
You told me to go '(Wuh)
That you are looking for something else (Wuh)
I like a fool on your portal (ey)
If as a dog I am loyal (Yah!)

[Chorus: Marc Seguí & Rauw Alejandro]
And now I want you to come back as a child, '
Since you've gone funny joke '
I have cut my hair, I bought another dye
Looking to see if I find any like you in Tinder
My girl, you are the muse of my sad songs
I can't close my eyes while you don't think
You make me go to 'my mistake'
And it is that forgetting will not be a simple task

[Post-Stribillo: Rauw Alejandro]
No, OH, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH
The world freezes me whenever we see each other
Discussing with you is like a shooting
And I think about dying the first, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2: Marc Seguí]
You and I, the two together 'in front of the sea
I know where you want to go
Although look like that, it won't work
If we understand each other without talking

I die when you go
I play the sky if you are
Sitting on my portal
Always making you wait (Yah!)

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Marc Seguí]
And now I want you to return as a child the weekend
Since you've been funny jokes
I have cut my hair, I bought another dye
Looking to see if I find any like you in Tinder
My girl, you are the prota of my sad songs
You can't close your eyes while you get rid of me
You tell others that I don't have more chewing gum
I just give you love, it's that simple

[Post-Stribillo: Marc Seguí]
WOH, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH
The world freezes me whenever we see each other
Discussing with you is like a shooting
And I think about dying the first, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3: Pol Granch & Rauw Alejandro]
You and I, the two together without thinking
With you as a child in toys "r" us
Let the light go out at Christmas
If we release electricity
Look, that I try, but fades you
I always make myself happy, but today I don't feel like
And do not understand that you have always been different
As Venice without water, like Madrid without people (Yah!)
[Chorus: Marc Seguí, Pol Granch & Rauw Alejandro]
And now I want you to return as a child the weekend (the weekend)
Since you've gone funny jokes (they are not funny)
I have cut my hair, I bought another dye (ah-ah-ah)
Looking to see if I find any like you in Tinder (AH-AH-AH)
My girl, you are the prota of my sad songs (AH-AH-AH)
I can't close my eyes while you deviate me (ah-ah-ah)
You tell others that I don't have more gum (ah-ah-ah)
I just give you love, it's that simple (-ple)

[Post-Stribillo: Marc Seguí & Rauw Alejandro, both]
WOH, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH
The world freezes me whenever we see each other
Discussing with you is like a shooting
And I think about dying the first, Woh, OH-OH-OH-OH

[Bridge: Rauw Alejandro & Marc Seguí, Marc Seguí]
You always leave me (you always leave me)
You always leave me (you always leave me)
You always leave me (from me, from me)
Of me, oh-oh-oh-oh
