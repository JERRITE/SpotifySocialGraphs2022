Percocet (Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "Percocet (Remix)" Ft. Lenny Tavárez, Chris Wandell & Chemist Ultra Mega]

[Enter: Lenny Tavárez]
"The Beatllione"
D-Note is on the beat
What happened? (AH)
What I call you and you don't take the phone (no, no)
I don't know why you hide from me, Baby, if I
Stop being from me, pa 'mi, to give you to' (eh; Lenny Tavárez Baby)

[Chorus: Alex Rose]
Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (Picocet)
What are you with another I don't know (huh)
I want to see you again (see you again; Wuh!)
Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (hey!)
What are you with another I don't know (huh)
I want to see you again (see you again; Wuh!)
[Verse 1: Lenny Tavarez]
I no longer want love (Nah), I want marijuana
And a plane pa 'move to'a the week
Two Colombian ', two Venezuelan', two Cuban '
Who want to caviar and ask me on my face
But nights without you are strange
Fame is sleeping in my bed
We make love very rich to'a the night, the office in the morning
I don't want to be any Tony Montana
I want you to call if you don't call me (hehe)
I want to get two Perco 'and give you the pelas that I always gave you (Wuh!)

[Bridge: Lenny Tavárez & Chris Wandell]
I am so looking forward to me (to me, me)
I have to see you again to survive
(Lenny Tavárez; Chris Wandell)

[Verse 2: Chris Wandell]
I have percet, from tre 'I have already gotten twelve
Of marijuana I don't know how many phillies enroll and I smoked
The champagne 'pa' celebrate and I have a mourning, that's why I take Black and not rosé
If happiness fled me it was because I harassed her
Siri why don't you call me?
If for me I leave fame
I deliver the money and to 'that
In exchange for seeing her and giving her another kiss
Nandito, let him know
That this is forever like skin tattoos
It will always be your measure in my heart and nobody else will fit

Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (Picocet)
What are you with another I don't know
I want to see you again (see you again; Wuh!)
Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (hey!)
What are you with another I don't know (huh)
I want to see you again (see you again)

[Verse 3: ultra mega chemist]
(Ultra Mega Chemist)
When I drink two pots to think about that ass (mommy)
Perfect the doctor who did it, Diablo Mami, that was hard
Beautiful your skin, beautiful your buttock ', beautiful your thigh', beautiful your face when it will come (Yeah)
It sets me like a carbide
Mommy, I swear, he has me drinking picocet with pure romo
Already 'drunk toy, but I don't know (I don't know) if leather comes safe
Tell me why you ignore me, if I (I), I call you all 'time'
If it does not appear from here until 12, your friend collaborates me (PRR)

[Verse 4: Alex Rose]
You made me witchcraft
Because I still can't forget when I told me
That I wouldn't take it out and inside you came to me
As Tito Snow manufacturing fantasia '
The date does not expire even if the day spends'
Hookia'o as coca, you ere 'my crazy and you have me in a skate
Crazy like Joker, you my Harley Quinn
Sprite Zero with Robitussin
Adderall or a vessel of Lean
Wrapped in the note and I know it shows
How to forget those buttocks
I know I behave like an idiot, Baby
[Chorus: Alex Rose]
Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (Picocet)
What are you with another I don't know (huh)
I want to see you again (see you again; Wuh!)
Tell me why you ignore me
You have me getting percet (hey!)
What are you with another I don't know (huh)
I want to see you again (see you again; Wuh!)
