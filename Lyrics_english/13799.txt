Special Affair Lyrics[Verse 1]
Penny for your thoughts, I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on stayin' too long
So you should come here and sit yo ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am
Who I am
[Chorus]
I bet this Patron
Make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl, your cover's blown, but you already knew that
You already knew that, you already knew that

[Post-Chorus]
And we can burn one
We can burn one

[Verse 2]
Playin' in the dark, I might break your heart
I can get you high if you wanna climb
'Cause fuck leavin' alone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on stayin' too long
So you should come here and sit yo ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am
Who I am

[Chorus]
I bet this Patron
Make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl, your cover's blown, but you already knew that
You already knew that, you already knew that
I bet this Patron
Make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl, your cover's blown, but you already knew that
You already knew that, you already knew that
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
And we can burn one
We can burn one

[Outro]
