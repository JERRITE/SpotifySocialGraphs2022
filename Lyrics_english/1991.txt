Better When I’m Dancin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, hey, mmm
Hey

[Verse 1]
Don't think about it
Just move your body
Listen to the music
Sing, oh, ey, oh
Just move those left feet
Go ahead, get crazy
Anyone can do it
Sing, oh, ey, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Show the world you've got that fire (Fire)
Feel the rhythm getting louder
Show the room what you can do
Prove to them you've got the moves, hey
I don't know about you

[Chorus]
But I feel better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
Better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
We can do this together
I bet you feel better when you're dancing, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Pa-pa-pa-da-da
La-la-la-la-da-da
La-la-la-la-da-da
Pa-pa-da-da

[Verse 2]
When you finally let go
And you slay that solo
'Cause you listen to the music
Sing, oh, ey, oh
'Cause you're confident, babe
And you make your hips sway
We knew that you could do it
Sing, oh, ey, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Show the world you've got that fire (Fire baby)
Feel the rhythm getting louder
Show the room what you can do
Prove to them you've got the moves
I don't know about you

But I feel better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
Better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
(Oh) We can do this together
I bet you feel better when you're dancing, yeah, yeah, hey
