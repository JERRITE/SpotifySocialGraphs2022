A new love lyrics [lyrics by "a new love"]

[Verse 1]
You must look for a new love, that you do not keep your problems
That is not like me, at dinner time
That when he dies of jealousy he never tells you anything
That does not have as me, so many wounds in the soul
You must look for a new love, that is a gentleman
Have a profession, without money problems
Be friends with your friends, sympathize with your parents
And never speak of more, that I cannot hurt you
[Pre-car]
But life, you always know me
And now I have to say, I always say what I feel

[Chorus]
That you will never find who to look at the stars
Someone who can get off with a kiss one of them
Someone who makes you feel touch the sky with your hands
Someone who makes you fly like me, you will not find it
That you will never find someone who will really love you
Someone who makes you cry, so much love, of so many kisses
Someone to walk like two crazy hands
Someone who makes you vibrate like me, you will not find it

[Verse 2]
You must look for a new love, which remembers the dates
That is not like me, always fulfill your promises
Someone who may love you just a little and a certain part
That is not like me, that I only live to love you

[Pre-car]
But life, you always know me
And now I have to say, I always say what I feel

[Chorus]
That you will never find who to look at the stars
Someone who can get off with a kiss one of them
Someone who makes you feel touch the sky with your hands
Someone who makes you fly like me, you will not find it
That you will never find someone who will really love you
Someone who makes you cry, so much love, of so many kisses
Someone to walk like two crazy hands
Someone who makes you vibrate like me, you will not find it

You must look for a new love, that you do not keep your problems
That is not like me, at dinner time
That when he dies of jealousy he never tells you anything
That does not have as me, so many wounds in the hall
