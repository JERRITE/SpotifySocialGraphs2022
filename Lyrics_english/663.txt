THE BED (REMIX) LYRICS [LETTER OF "THE BED (REMIX)" FT. Chencho Corleone & Rauw Alejandro]

[Intro: Ozuna, Lunay, Ozuna & Lunay, Chencho Corleone]
What I want is to break the bed with you
The Martian '
Remix (woh-oh)
If your husband doesn't love you (he doesn't love you)
Give it my bed that suits you (huh)
This will stay in four stop '(Parede')
The chemistry we and I have it '(Lu-Lunay)
The Level '(the Level')
I can notice in your eyes what you want '(WOH-OH-OH)
Something that does not happen to me (EH-EH)
The Martian '(No-Oh-Oh), EH-EH
[Chorus: Myke Towers, Lunay & Ozuna]
What I love you is to see (WO-OH-OH-OH)
Pa 'beautiful with you (pa' beautiful with you)
Leave your sheet 'wet (woh-oh-oh-oh)
Practice to the pose 'with you, oh (with you)
And what I want is to break (-per)
The bed with you (-ty)
Leave your wet sheets (woh-oh)
And then everyone takes their way, Oh (Woh-Oh)

[Verse 1: ozuna]
(Ozuna)
Baby, he doesn't want to 'fall in love
E 'that I am faithful to fail (woh-oh)
Love was wrong
I left my ex, but you just arrive (arriving)
And chemistry in my bed made you wet
I do 'again'
And if you want to 'repeat it, take care of whom I go'
That your friend live wants to feel it
It may happen if selfishness attacks you (woh-oh)
You just tell me real, what you want '
Knows 'the number and knows' lo 'levele' (woh-oh, woh-oh)
Since you are 'pa' me, I want it to come '
Take me to the jet and stay with the Mercede '(with La Mercede')
You just let me know the day you are doing '
Although I know that I have a couple of 'ma' (more ')
Somo 'Friend' for the opportunity '
That I do it 'a couple of vece' more '(ah, oh)
You Might Also Like [verse 2: Chencho Corleone]
Ta-ta-tan no 'vemo' even with the look you and me
We tempt ourselves knowing that there will no longer be control
If your pillow will speak and one day confess
I see them that you have told me that as I do not there '
Even on the floor I had to whip you
No 'envelope', there is no bed that endures us
For your groan 'I know you lost meaning
Like your 'fluid', they are irrigated by all 'part'
You prefer me in intimacy, see me in 'Your weakness
The one that causes anxiety and alters your activity '
Controls the intensity of your 'screams and the' wins' of more and more
And much more, until wetting the 'savanna'

[Bridge: Lunay & Chencho Corleone, Chencho Corleone]
Shut up everything that happens
In the early morning and nobody suspects
Whenever you talk to me, you ask me to go
That sex does to you and not somo 'na' (na ', na')

[Verse 3: Myke Towers]
Everyone takes their course
Traveling in smoke always the room I cloud it
Photo 'is thrown with the AP and Hublot
I still have a video 'of the two naked', more 'figure' that in Judo
Baby, you will see 'that your sheets I will leave you wet'
Touch yourself listening to this song and open it
There it is said that you ere 'mi gatubela
No one discovers us, huh
[Pre-car: Myke Towers]
But the bed breaks her '
I can't 'leave a trace whenever we escape'
I do not know if I am the main one or if I am the alternate
Ask them to win 'that there is the matemo'

[Chorus: Lunay, Myke Towers, Chencho Corleone, Lunay & Chencho Corleone]
What I love you e 'see (see)
Pa 'Bellaquear with you (-tigo)
Leave your sheet 'wet (wet)
Practice to the pose 'with you, oh
What I want e 'break-e-e-e-
The bed with you
Leave your sheets wet
And then everyone takes their way, Ouh

[Verse 4: Rauw Alejandro]
(RA-RAUW)
She doesn't 'psycho, but fights if she sees me with another (uh-wuh!)
And I turn out if I don't have that 'buttock' (uh-wuh!)
At the forefront of the people, we don't kiss us' the mouth
If someone suspects e 'that in your face it shows
The beautiful one must lower it (Rra!)
At Madrugá 'I called her (Rra!)
I want to tie it to my bed
That she is to take off you have to work it
I threw, replied the location (his!)
He sent me not late, fast without clothes (uh!)
He waited for me, kill you to kill you first (ey)
I am to make your desire ', eh (EH-YEAH-YEAH)

[Verse 5: Lunay]
(Make me)
Send me the ubi that I already went to hunt you
I threw to the podere 'pa' mistreat you
Ask him to pierce him for his
For your dust, I get to Mars
You sa-tú you know that your mai 'and your Pai' you bring it 'problem'
That escapes you 'to'a the night' pa 'break the road
System addicted
He has a mastery down beautiful '
Send me the ubi that I went out to hunt you
I threw to the podere 'pa' mistreat you
Ask him to pour him 'and ahead
For your dust, I get to Mars

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro, Chencho Corleone, Chencho Corleone & Myke Towers, Myke Towers]
I want to see you (UH-UH-UH)
Pa 'beautiful with you (with you)
