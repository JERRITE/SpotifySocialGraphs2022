Let's leave lyrics ["let's leave" ft. Andy Rivera & Maluma]

(Kapital Music)
(Dayme, the high)

(Hello?)

[Andy Rivera]
I know what to call this time
Suddenly I can bother you, I know ...
(You're drunk?)

[Kevin Roldán]
But too ...
(These are not hours)
That you would not have answered if you were with him
I want to see you

(Kevin Roldán)

[Kevin Roldán]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
To remember those moments when you were mine

[Andy Rivera]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
To remember those moments when you were mine

(Maluma say it)

[Maluma]
I went through you to school and where nobody saw
Your kisses, my caresses we always did it
My romantic side, we put heart
Baby, what a beautiful situation
You might also like that I'm calling you
I wanted to know if you keep thinking about me
As I am thinking about you
Is that I go crazy
Time passes and I don't have you

[Andy Rivera]
Although it has been a long time, I know
Neither you from me, nor I have known again
I would like to relive that moment again
Baby, when he contemplated your nakedness

[Kevin Roldán]
Although it has been a long time, I know
Neither you from me, nor I have known again
I would like to relive that moment again
Baby, when he contemplated your nakedness

[Andy Rivera]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
To remember those moments when you were mine

[Kevin Roldán]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
To remember those moments when you were mine
(Mr. KR)

What a beautiful stories
When you were my girlfriend
Moments that remained in my memory
Sometimes life plays us with ironic things
Baby, you know love has no logic

(Tell it Andy)

[Andy Rivera]
Let's not tell lies
All the past time was better
I want you to tell me
If you think everything was a mistake

If we were so happy why we end up
Acting as children and we leave ourselves, Yeah
Time has happened to us
However I have not forgotten
Nothing I feel has changed

[Maluma]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
And relive those moments when you were mine

[Kevin Roldán]
Let's go out to talk for a while any day
To remember those moments when you were mine
