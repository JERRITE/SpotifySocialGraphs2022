If it's not now Lyricstus Eyes were that night
A flash of love
Your heart marked the rhythm
That my life turned
You tried to tell me something
And that did not happen
(It didn't happen)
And slow were those hours waiting for your voice

Chorus:
You will call!
I know it
You will call!
If it's not now tomorrow you will come
Because if it's not now
It will be tomorrow
We will get together on a road
If it's not now
It will be tomorrow
Like music in the ear
You will call! (You will call)
I know it
You will call!
If it's not now tomorrow you will come

Because if it's not now
It will be tomorrow
You will say love with a look
If not now it will be tomorrow
You will come love to my window
You will call
(You will talk to me)
I know it
(you'll love me)
You will call
If it's not now tomorrow you will come

Your eyes were that night
A flash of love
(A flash of love)
And it was like traveling suddenly in the same illusion
We try to stay alone
And that did not happen
(It didn't happen)
And slow were those hours waiting for your voice
You Might Also Like You will call!
I know it
You will call!
If it's not now tomorrow you will come
Because if not now, it will be tomorrow
We will get together on a road
If it's not now
It will be tomorrow
Like music in the ear

You will call (sooner or later) I will call it)
If it's not now tomorrow you will see
Because if it's not now
If it's not now
If it's not now
You will call (sooner or later) I will call it)
If it's not now tomorrow comeaaaaaaaas
If not nowaaaaaa
It will be tomorrow
