THE JOAQUI MISION 08 LYRICS [LETTER OF "LA JOAQUI | Mission 08"]

[Intro: Don Omar]
Give it, don't be shy, break, abuser
Give it, don't be shy, break, abuser
Give it, don't be shy, break, abuser
Give it, don't be shy, break, abuser

[Verse 1: the Joaqui]
I'm not shy or stick '
What is missing teta ', I have plenty of gram'
If it looks anger, the re zapateamo '
The one who does not run, flies, Ã±eri, here does not blink '
Daddy, for you I stop bondi
I already wrote you like five songs'
Daddy, for you I stop bondi
Fumemo 'and vamo' to fly like plane '(what do you think, Alan?)
[Chorus: the Joaqui]
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst, attentive (my cat will make your dog)

[Post-Stribillo: The Joaqui]
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)
Mmm, he likes how I play (I touch)

[Verse 2: the Joaqui & Don Omar]
I put all 'the guacha' to show the tattoo in the tail, tail, tail, tail
Your Guacho went through my club, he told me "Hello, Hello"
And I make more money with clothes than in ball '(give, don't be shy, break, abuser)

[Chorus: the Joaqui]
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst
Pay the return, which I come with sixty
If I play in your cheboli, the bar is burst
Pay the return, pay the return
Pay the return, pay the return

Pay the return, huh?
That we just want to make music for a little while
To forget to 'a little
We are not as cold as it seems, huh? Haha
Making a barbarian quilombo of Space Music, huh?
This is how Joaqui sounds when Alan produces it
Dale, Alan Gomez, Rompela Alm, King

[Outro: the Joaqui]
Mmm, likes how I play
Mmm, likes how I play
Mmm, likes how I play
Mmm, likes how I play
Mmm, mmm, how do I touch, touch
Mmm, mmm, how do I play, touch
