Room of Nightmares LyricsStep inside where your
True self awaits
Find your will
And then you’ll find your fate
This room of nightmares
So much to see
This room of nightmares
Shall set you free

Set you free
Close your eyes
And you will see
Kill your suffering
And drown your fears
Happiness beyond all that’s real
This room of nightmares
So much to see
This room of nightmares
Shall set you freeYou might also like1Embed
