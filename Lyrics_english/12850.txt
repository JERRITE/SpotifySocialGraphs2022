Come Together Now Lyrics[Intro]
Come together now

[Verse 1]
I'm cookie and you're cream, sugar gasoline
You're the kick, I'm the snare, let's go make a beat
You build, I knock it down
I'm a verb, you're a noun
You swerve, I lean, we walk down the same street
I'm gas, you're the brake
Here and wide awake
Together we can drive all night with the windows down
You're AC, I'm the heat
Scraped knees, concrete
You make me better so let's come together now
[Chorus]
Come together now
Come together now
Come together now
Come together now

[Verse 2]
Square to a hexagon
More sides, less wrong
Pepsi, Coke, then you mix a little ice
Street signs in camouflage
All day "blah blah blah"
Got no time to waste, paid the asking price
I paint inside the lines
Takes me too much time
You're a mess and that's all I want to be
Loosen up a bit
Flex and take the hit
If I make you better then let's come together now

[Chorus]
Come together now
Come together now
Come together now
Come together now
You might also like[Outro]
Come together now
Come together now
Come together now
Come together nowEmbed
