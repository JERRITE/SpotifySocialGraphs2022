Between Me & You Lyrics[Chorus: Rowlene & Flame]
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
[Verse 1: Flame]
Lately we’ve been running out of happiness
No phone calls or scary messages
I can’t even tell if these are challenges
And I’m starting to feel like we shouldn’t be having this
Really starting to hate this, running out all of the patience I have for you
And even starting to get overly faded
Really starting to hate this, really starting to hate this
Got me fucked chilled in the stu, ripping out pages
Tryna get my mind right
Only thing to do but get it high right
What you want from my life
Coz everything I do is not enough and God is here like

[Chorus - Rowlene & Flame]
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you

Trynna get my head right
Only thing I can do is [?]
On repeat like we always on the same shit
Back and forth [?] take another hit
Wonder if we ever gonna make it
Coz you the one that’s always out here flexing
And you the one that’s always out finessing
I can’t help but be the submissive
I can’t help but be this protective
Coz you are the one I’ve been missing
Coz you are the one I’ve been feeling
But I can’t be stuck on this lame shit

[Chorus - Rowlene & Flame]
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Here we go again like we always do
Sometimes I wonder if things are gonna be alright
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and youEmbed
