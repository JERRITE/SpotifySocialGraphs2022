Tas boot lyrics [letter of "tas boot" ft. Farruko & Lary Over]

[Enter: Juhn & Millly]
Milly, Milly, Yeah-Yeah
It is not worth it to continue 'insisting (Yah!)
If this love already died (died)
Ahogate alone in suffering (Yah!)
That the ship sank
I already tired (Yeah-Yeah)
To love and believe (woh-woh)
In your love how false it was (woh)
And finally I see you (wuh!)
[Chorus: Farruko & Millly]
Don't call me 'more' (Yeah)
Do not look for me anymore
That even if you cry
Don't give you another chance
Don't call me 'more'
Don't look for 'more'
What although I cry '
I don't vo'a dartе another chance (Farru!)

[Verse 1: Farruko]
It is a hijeputada
What you did to me, you failed me
And you made fun of as if nothing
But, baby, you forgot (Yeah-Yeah; Blep!)
That the world turns 'and there are more people' alante
That you didn't value me and you were an ignorant
And now he intends 'that everything is as before'
You failed, you lost, but you forgot
That the world turns 'and there are people more' alante (eh-eh)
You didn't value me and you were an ignorant (eh-eh)
And now he intends 'that everything is as before' (eh, h)
You failed, you lost, baby, you screwed up

[Verse 2: juhn]
That forgive you gave ', because I do not vote it
Baby, I don't go back to you or be born again
I don't call me ', don't look for me', don't appear to appear
That of that water I no longer drink and I do not vote it to you
I prefer to stay here in my bed (bed)
Doll, leave the drama (drama)
Tell me why he claims'
Girl, Change Program '(EH)
That 'tears that spilled' are trick
If your black heart loves (Wuh!)

Don't call me 'more' (Yeah)
Do not look for me anymore
That even if you cry
Don't give you another chance
Don't call me 'more'
Don't look for 'more'
That although I cry '
Don't give you another chance (Ly-Ly-Ly-Ly)

[Verse 3: Lyanno & Millly]
And you don't work 'and what is not useful
I am not interested already kissing your mouth (your mouth)
Turn on another phillie because you don't note
Remember, the bed is not who sleeps it, and who leaves her broken
Now it hurts, Pue ', Baby, how tragic
I already have another that makes me more 'rich
Baby, with her the dust 'are magical' and with you basic '
Yours ended
Look for another one who fill you with Kisse '
I no longer plan to give color to your 'Grise' day
If you think 'I'm going to come back
I advise you that this trip lands'
What does it hurt now? Pue ', Baby, how tragic
I already have another that makes me more 'rich
Baby, with her the dust 'are magical' and with you basic '
Yours ended (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah)
[Verse 4: Milly & Lary Over]
And although I feel alone, I don't want me to come back '
You forgot about me when I was in the cell (ah)
Bregué bastard with you and that does not remember '(ah-ah)
But you will do the same for you to bite you '
And so go Lejo ', I don't want to see your reflection'
Now it's your turn to look at you crying in front of the mirror
Seeing me for the Rede 'with the other one that celebrates (OH-OH)
You said that he is now old and you took me from asshole (Yeah)
And now you want to return (Yeah-Yeah)
Because that bastard was unfaithful (no, no)
And now it is happening to you what you did to me (eh-eh)
But I care if I feel 'sad (the wason, baby)

[Verse 5: Lary Over]
You played with fire and burned (wow)
To your game I made Jaque Mate (Yeah-Yeah)
My heart, baby, you crushed (hehehe)
So many promise 'and the shit (wuh)
Goodbye, goodbye, you left
You played with me, mommy, you know ', it's not a joke
Do not make you 'the crazy one, you know' very well what you did
Now I am the newspaper that you never read (hehehe)
Goodbye, goodbye, you left (Wuh!)
You played with me, mommy, you know ', it's not a joke (no)
Do not make you 'the crazy one, you know' very well what you did
Now I am the newspaper that you never read (hehehe)

[Choir: Farruko, Juhn, Farruko & Lary Over]
Don't call me 'more' (Yeah)
Do not look for me anymore
That even if you cry
Don't give you another chance
And don't call me 'more' (no, no)
Don't look for 'more' (woh-oh-oh-oh)
That although I cry '
Don't give you another chance (Wuh!) 1embed
