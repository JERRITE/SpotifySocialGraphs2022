Our Lyricsperd√≥name songs to return, after so much
I know we swore and not speak again, or listen ...
Our songs, that if you look good, are shouting
You don't see that I will always love you
Although the rain erases our history
And you are no longer here
Even if they tell me it was a mistake
And now you are with another love
Although maybe he looks happy
I will always be thinking about you
You don't see that I will always love you
Even if the stars go out
And do not see the light again
Even if I never see you again
Even if you stop loving me
You are always going to be in me
I'm always going to be here
In our songs
Our songs
Forgive me for returning after so much
I know we swore and not go back
Nor listen to our songs
Well make us cry and are screaming
You don't see that I will always love you
Although the rain erases our history
And you are no longer here
Even if they tell me it was a mistake
And now you are with another love
Although maybe he looks happy
I will always be thinking about you
You don't see that I will always love you
Even if the stars go out
And do not see the light again
Even if I never see you again
Even if you stop loving me
You are always going to be in me
I'm always going to be here
In our songs, our songs ...
Even if I never see you again
Even if you stop loving me
You are always going to be in me
I'm always going to be here
In our songs our songs ...
Forgive me for returning, after so much ... You Might Also Likeembed
