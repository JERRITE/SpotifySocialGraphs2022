Electric Uncle Sam Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I am the plan, I am the man
Who tells you what, and when you can
I'm the old one that torments you
I am the voice that tells you to

[Chorus]
Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie
Mess with me, and boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere, I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam
[Verse 2]
You beg me please, on bended knees
Not to sit among the enemies
If you feel like you wanna dance
Then step aside and take a chance

[Chorus]
Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie
Mess with me and, boy, you're surely gonna die
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere, I am your Uncle Sam
Electric Uncle Sam

[Outro]
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
I am your Uncle Sam
Yeah
