â€‹picking myself up again Lyrics[Intro]
Love spirals
Like circles under my eyelids keeping me tired
The sunlight peeks through my window
And I'm trying

[Chorus]
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again
[Verse]
I got plans
I got friends
I got things to do
Can't even stop feeling down
Need to stay on the move
Body hurts, need insurance
But I think I'll get it soon
I have time, I'm not old
And I feel brand new
I feel stuck when I don't
Working harder than you
Can't even stop feeling down
Need to stay on the move
Body hurts, need insurance
But I'm figuring it out
I have time, I'm not old

[Chorus]
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again
I'm picking myself up again

[Verse]
I got plans
I got friends
I got things to do
Can't even stop feeling down
Need to stay on the move
Body hurts, need insurance
But I think I'll get it soon
I have time, I'm not old
And I feel brand new
