It’s Only Sex Lyrics[Intro]
The other night, I cried
While thinking of having sex with you
Not out of desire or shame
But some subconscious impulse to feel pain
I wiped my tears on my face and neck
And the backs of my ears and said “Now it’s sweat
Now it’s sweat; it’s sweat now”

[Verse 1]
Just to see you
It’s such a treasure
But when I feel you
My flesh yields no pleasure
And honey, I’m cultured
I’m very sex-positive
So what is this feeling?
It ain’t so positive

(Oh no)

[Chorus]
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? I like it
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? It’s only

[Break]
Okay, so I’ve been reading all the sex blogs
And they all talk about how okay it is to be gay
And straight and bisexual and asexual
And have sex however you like
But I don’t care about hundreds of hypothetical people
And their hypothetical sex deals
I care about me, and my sex deal!
What about my problems?

(Who cares?)

[Verse 2]
Baby, my body
Constantly betrays me
I try to betray it
I only hurt myself, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? I like it
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it?

[Post-Chorus]
It’s only
It’s only sex
It’s only
It’s only sex

[Bridge]
(Come on, sexual desire, speak!)
I want to hold you tight
I want to feel your love physically
I want to sleep with you
But only in the literal sense

[Chrous]
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? I like you
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? It’s only

I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? I like you
I can’t tell you if I like it, I like it, oh
What happens if I don’t like it? It's only
[Outro]
It’s only sex
(It's only sex)
It's only
(Ohh)
It's only sex
(No, it's not)
It's only sex
(Yeah, it’s only sex)
It's only
(Just think about a beach)
It's only sex
(Sex, sex)
It's only sex
(I can't tell you if I like it)
