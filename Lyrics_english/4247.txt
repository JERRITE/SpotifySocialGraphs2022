Lyrics camouflage ["camouflage" letter]] 

 Effective camouflage 
 Despair for showing you more 
 All deep loves the costume 

 Let's separate love 
 Of the avidity of mitigating pain 
 And only for thorns discard the flower 
 My usual awkwardness 
 Until today 
 Too much is nothing to do 
 I am romantic and full of clich√©s 
 Without my camouflage 
 I gave myself to you
