The Loto Lyrics [Loto Loto "]

[Intro: tini]
A little bit, a little can you get drunk
Two glasses of wine

[Verse 1: tini]
Tamo 'talking about voltage
Today we are sweating all the makeup
You are flying high without passage
The one that is with you does not want me to go down
But today I came with five friends, look what I brought
This now looks like our catwalk
One passes, they are two, they are very beautiful
If the light goes, baby, I turned on the candle
[Chorus: Tini]
Because today I don't lower him ', he was' putting together a fuss
Here is 'pure broken hearts'
What people say little about me
Tonight it seems that hop '
Tomorrow we confess'
The baby with me won the lotus
I want to do the bad little by little
Tonight it seems that hop '

[Post-car: tini & anitta]
Tomorrow confess' (mmh, mmh)
Tomorrow confess' (mmh, mmh)
Oh, how rich the balacor '(mmh)
Tonight seems to be

[Verse 2: anitta]
Today I come for mine (mine)
Direct flight from Miami for Rio (Rio)
Causing the whole hamlet (-r√≠o) to dance
I brought tini, vamo 'to build tremendous mess
Let him go up and down, it's the only thing I ask you (I ask for)
I like to give it hard against the wall (wall)
Diamond shining 'and the head to the foot' (foot ')
And whoever is with me, won the lotus (lotus)

Because today I don't lower him ', he was' putting together a fuss

[Verse 3: Becky G]
Estamo 'Activa''s girls from Party, with a Flow Safari
The baby if he answers is when he calls Beck G
Have 'all Drip, Drip, all of Gucci-Cci
I have you embob'o how Lele a Guayna Bichy
Short dress with nothing underneath, huh
Pa 'this is that I work
We have the Honey, Expensive, expensive
I'm with mine 'and the rest for the fuck
[Pre-car: Becky G]
You yes, you, you do want ', I have, baby wants'
What will you ask for permission? If too, sorry you can
With me blessed, this does not come out 'e la' stop '
You yes, you yes, you want ', you yes, you yes, you do want' today

[Chorus: Tini, Anitta & Tini, Anitta, Becky G & Tini]
