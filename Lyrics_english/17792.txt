Twirlanta Lyrics[Intro]
Gang, gang, gang
I'm the hottest young nigga in the city (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
(Grah, grah, grah)
I'm just in charge of this shit
Gang, gang, gang
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Grrt)
Bang, bang, bang
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Chorus]
My stepper gon' brush him if I press the button, too drippy to scuffle (Drip, drip, too drippy to scuffle)
The blick in the duffle, it came with a muzzle, so why would I tussle? (Blicky, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky, so why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded, we done turned nothin' to somethin' (We done turned nothin' to somethin')
Niggas be cappin', bluffin', tweak, that's a hole in your muffin (Brrt, tweak, that's a hole in your muffin)
[Verse]
What's all the tension? (Skrrt) Tried to run off with the drip, but ain't give me a mention (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Swish him, we bench him, treesh at the drop, we gon' pull up with blickies and drench him (Boom, boom, boom, grrt)
Look at these actors (Skrrt), droppin' the rakes (Skrrt), they ain't ever spinned Cali (They ain't ever spinned Cali, pussy)
Spinnin' for rappers (Skrrt), what's the chances (Skrrt) that he got his ratchet? (Skrrt, skrrt, boom, boom, boom)
It's gon' be a disaster, he ain't no stepper, that boy into fashion (Pussy)
Stop all that cappin', aim for his m훮th훮, cabbage, he in a casket (Grrt)
Gang-gang gon' wack him, he made a diss, trying to get a reaction (Pussy)
Can't wait to catch him, crash him, whole gang spinnin' for the back end (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, back end)
Want me to be disrespectful? Pull up to the funeral, spit in the coffin (Spit in that coffin)
Put more shots in his m훮th훮, they can't see his face, that's for all that talkin' (Boom, boom, boom, boom, pussy)
Headshot, he ain't gon' make it, his brains on the pavement, no witness, no statement (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
My killers ain't takin' no payment, they said it's for free, point him out, they gon' off him (Gang, gang, gang, pussy)
Gun a nigga down, drop a diss, R.I.P. Lil Pint, pour a four of that drip (Boom, boom, boom)
All we know, run down, go skitz, let my ooter catch him lackin' and they hoppin' out the whip (Grrt)
See all the hate through these Carti's (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Kodak fresh home off a pardon (Blicky)
Casamigos, don't sip no Bacardi (No Bacardi)
Reppin' Brooklyn like Biggie and Harden (Brooklyn)
Ride out, AR with the scope
Pull up with Coach, now he a ghost (Skrrt, skrrt)
Kill a opp, then make a toast (Grrt, pussy)
Hit a opp treesh while she drivin' the boat (Boom, boom, boom)
Stuffin' the stick in the glizzy (Blick, blick, glizzy)
Clip came see-through just like Bizzy
Hoolies gon' spin 'til he dizzy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Spot him and hop out the renty (Grrt)
Catch a body then hit up the jeweler (Boom, boom, boom)
I got twenty blue tips in the Ruger (Gang, gang, gang)
Back then, used to flock out the Uber (Skrrt, skrrt)
Off a scooter, then maneuver (Skrrt, skrrt)
Can't respond to no nigga that gave his whole crew up (Ha-ha-ha), goofies
Niggas stole all the drip, act like they never knew us (Niggas stole all my drip, act like they never knew us)
Got a bad yellow bitch that'll line you from Cuba (Got a bad yellow bitch, treesh, treesh)
She gon' swing me the addy, we pulled up and smoked 'em like hookah (That addy, we pulled up and smoked 'em)
Niggas ain't spinnin' shit, they just type on computers (Ain't spinning shit, they just type on)
And my last name "Blick", so I'm picking the tool up (Blick, gang, gang, gang, Blicky, the Blicky)
You might also like[Chorus]
My stepper gon' brush him if I press the button, too drippy to scuffle (Too drippy to scuffle)
The blick in the duffle, it came with a muzzle, so why would I tussle? (So why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded, we done turned nothin' to somethin' (Bands, bands)
Niggas be cappin', bluffin', tweak, that's a hole in your muffin (Tweak, that's a hole in your muffin)
My stepper gon' brush him if I press the button, too drippy to scuffle (Too drippy to scuffle)
The blick in the duffle, it came with a muzzle, so why would I tussle? (So why would I tussle?)
Diamonds dancin', flooded, we done turned nothin' to somethin' (Bands, bands)
Niggas be cappin', bluffin', tweak, that's a hole in your muffin
