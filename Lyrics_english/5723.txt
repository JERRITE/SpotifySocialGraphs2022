Neptune Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pitch black, pale blue
It was a stained glass variation of the truth
And I felt empty handed
You let me set sail with cheap wood
So I patched up every leak that I could
'Til the blame grew too heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
Stitch by stitch, I tear apart
If brokenness is a form of art
I must be a poster child prodigy
Thread by thread, I come apart
If brokenness is a work of art
Surely this must be my masterpiece
[Chorus]
I'm only honest when it rains
If I time it right, the thunder breaks
When I open my mouth
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how
I'm only honest when it rains
An open book with a torn out page
And my ink's run out
I wanna love you, but I don't know how

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know how
No, I don't know how
I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I wanna love you

[Verse 2]
Pitch black, pale blue
These wild oceans shake what's left of me loose
Just to hear me cry mercy
A strong wind at my back
So I, I lift up the only sail that I have
This tired white flag
(White flag)
(White flag)
(White flag)
(White flag)

I'm only honest when it rains
If I time it right, the thunder breaks
When I open my mouth
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how
I'm only honest when it rains
An open book with a torn out page
And my ink's run out
I wanna love you, but I don't know how, know how
I'm only honest when it rains
(Know how, know how)
If I time it right, the thunder breaks
(Know how, know how)
When I open my mouth
(I wanna love you)
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how, know how
I'm only honest when it rains
(Know how, know how)
An open book with a torn out page
(Know how, know how)
And my ink's run out
(I wanna love you)
I wanna love you, but I don't know how

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I wanna love you, but I don't know how
I wanna love you27Embed
