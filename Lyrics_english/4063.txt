She chases me Lyricsletra "she chases me"

I promised that I would not call
That gave you the same, you said
That only one night would be
I wasn't going to care

And now I see the cell phone, likes on Instagram
He speaks to me on WhatsApp, something is wrong
He forgot that I told him that I don't want anything
[Choir: Alkilados, Bonny Lovy]
She chases me and I don't feel anything ah there
He was wrong, fell in love like crazy
She chases me, I don't feel anything ah.
He was wrong, fell in love like a crazy love

We swore not to see each other and never speak
Stop looking for love where there is no
We went one night and already, we went one night and already
There is no story to tell

I know you want, but I don't love you for me
I know you want, but I'm not for you, baby
You know it was like that, tell me what to insist for
I know you want, but I don't love you for me
I know you want, but I'm not for you, baby
You know it was like that, I never wanted to hurt you

[Choir: Alkilados, Bonny Lovy]
She chases me and I don't feel anything ah there
He was wrong, fell in love like crazy
She chases me, I don't feel anything ah.
He was wrong, fell in love like a crazy love

And I don't feel anything
And we promised that there would be no calls
And I don't feel anything
Just one night and nothing more
You might also like you want, but I don't love you for me
I know what you want, but I'm not for you, baby
You know it was like that, tell me to insist
I know you want, but I don't love you for me
I know what you want, but I'm not for you, baby
You know it was like that, I never wanted to hurt you

[Choir: Alkilados, Bonny Lovy]
She chases me and I don't feel anything ah there
He was wrong, fell in love like crazy
She chases me, I don't feel anything ah.
He was wrong, fell in love like a crazy love

Ma ma aya

I promised that I would not call
That gave you the same
You said that only one night would be
I wasn't going to care

And now I see the cell phone, likes on Instagram
He speaks to me on WhatsApp, something is wrong
I forget that I told him, I don't want anything

[Choir: Alkilados, Bonny Lovy]
She chases me and I don't feel anything ah there
He was wrong, fell in love like crazy
She chases me, I don't feel anything ah.
He was wrong, fell in love like a crazy love
