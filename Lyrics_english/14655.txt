Reset lyrics [1. Department: Mustafa Sandal]
It breaks your world, useless love
You put your mortar, sitting stones
Don't resist, give up, a horse reset
Life starts from scratch every day, oh

The horse would say the grief, what is it?
Look at a bone leather left
Is the value to those who go, unhappy
Look at the tired body
Reset your heart, take your trouble
Is there no way like this in the case
We went through a long and thin road
If the end of death is no use
If the end of death is no use

[Nakarat: EYPio]
Throw the reset, throw the reset throw
Reset your head, throw reset
A relax you, your situation is always crippled
This is not normal love, yours is psychopath
Throw the reset, throw the reset throw
Reset your head, throw reset
A relax you, your situation is always crippled
This is not normal love, yours is psychopath

[one. Department: Mustafa Sandal]
It breaks your world, useless love
You put your mortar, sitting stones
Don't resist, give up, a horse reset
Life starts from scratch every day, oh

The horse would say the grief, what is it?
Look at a bone leather left
Is the value to those who go, unhappy
Look at the tired body
You Might Also Likerereset with your heart, take your trouble
Is there no way like this in the case
We went through a long and thin road
If the end of death is no use

[2. Part: EYPio]
It was obvious that this is like this.
Sometimes Speak, Sometimes Holds Sush
The girl taught me in Russian
I didn't wait personally

Musti knows which heart is the horse?
The plane's unrealized get up
Your pale is escaping to every subject
Think well girl who will you go with

Nothing told me, "You are nothing." to say
No father call for me ***
There is a wheel 17 inches in the clip
17 feet like 17 pinch

[Nakarat: EYPio]
Throw the reset, throw the reset throw
Reset your head, throw reset
A relax you, your situation is always crippled
This is not normal love, yours is psychopath
Throw the reset, throw the reset throw
Reset your head, throw reset
A relax you, your situation is always crippled
This is not normal love, yours is psychopath
[Outro: Mustafa Sandal]
