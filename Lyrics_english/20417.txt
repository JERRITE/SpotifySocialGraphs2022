Emotions like summer
We'll wait for a blue sky
And I turn and hold you
As we watch the sunrise
'Cause this is amazing
Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon

[Chorus: John Newman]
But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh
[Verse 2: John Newman]
I'm so lost in these summer nights
So lost in your crystal light
And even when this night is day
I won't regret the words I'm saying

[Chorus: John Newman]
Yeah, I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh

[Bridge: John Newman]
Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold
(Never let you go, never let you go)
Through the longest of time, I will never let you go
(Never let you go, never let you go)
If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold, oh-no

[Chorus: John Newman]
But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no!
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no ohYou might also like5Embed
