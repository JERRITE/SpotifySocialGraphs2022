I Love It Loud Lyrics[Intro]
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no I never could be tamed, better believe it
Guilty until I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I want to be the president
('Cause I love it)
[Chorus]
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise

[Verse 2]
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two fisted to the very end
No more treated like aliens, we're not going to take it
No lies, no more alibis
Turn it up, got me hypnotized
Rock on, won't be tranquilized
('Cause I love it)

[Chorus]
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise

(I love it)
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise

[Bridge]
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Turn it up

Headlines jungle is the only rule
Front page roar of the nation cool
Turn it up, this is my attitude, take it or leave it

[Outro + Fade Out]
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes

Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
(I love it)
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise
(I love it)
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
