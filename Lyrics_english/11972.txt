PORSCHE TRUCK Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy

[Verse]
Range Rover Sports Truck, get yo clique torched up
Think I'm on a (bleep) side, I'm tryna abort something
We can't take him up on no crimes, he might go and court some
I keep seeing Porsche trucks, I keep seeing Porsche trucks
Pussy nigga, get yo grind up, there ain't no shortcuts
I think all these niggas times up, they signing for sum
Get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck
[Hook]
Get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck
Get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck
Get ya, get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck
Get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck

[Outro]
Range Rover Sports Truck, get yo clique torched up
Pussy nigga, get yo grind up, there ain't no shortcuts
I think all these niggas times up, they signing for sum
Get ya clique torched up, spin em' in a Porsche truck
