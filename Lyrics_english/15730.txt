Lyricsha hallucinated started everything. It was your whim
I didn't trust. It was just sex
But what is sex? An attitude, such as art in general
I have understood. I'm here
Listen to me if I try to insist
Hold on enduring me
I love you but Love you. Love you!
I'm heavy. It's old. I love you but

Forgive me if I love you
And if we meet
A month ago or little more
Forgive if I don't talk to you under
If I don't shout it
Have I told you that I love you?
Forgive if I laugh at my restlessness
I look at you fixed and tremble
Just have you next to you
And feel in your arms
... if I'm here, if I talk to you excited
Yes! ... if I'm amazed
Ha! ... if I'm amazed
Ciao! How are you? (stupid question)
To me love you makes me predictable
I speak little, it's strange, I'm very slow
It's the wind, it's time, it's fire

Forgive me if I love you
And if we meet
A month ago or little more
Forgive if I don't talk to you under
If I don't shout it
Have I told you that I love you?
Forgive if I laugh at my restlessness
I look at you fixed and tremble
Just have you next to you
And feel in your arms
... if I'm here, if I talk to you excited
Yes! ... if I'm amazed
Ha! ... if I'm amazed
Oh yes, love, I love you! You might also likembed
