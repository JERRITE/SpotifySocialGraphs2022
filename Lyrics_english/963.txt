Memories (remix) Lyrics [letter of "memories (remix)" ft. Myke Towers & Lenny Tavárez]

[Intro: Farruko, Juhn & Lenny Tavárez]
Is a Bad Man Ting, Farru!
How to forget? (Lanzai) ‚Impossible to erase (Juhn" The All Star ")
That special place where I learned to love (Wuh!)
Between white sheets ‚girl‚ I'm going to get wet
Tell me if you are restless, tell me and spend looking for you, baby
Remix!

[Pre-Caro: Juhn & Farruko]
That old motel
It brings me memories of the day I made you a woman ‚ey, huh
You denied yourself, I insisted (yah-yah-yah)
We entered 'E night and we left' and day (Blep!)
And in bed I told you
[Choir: Juhn & Lenny Tavárez]
You ere 'mine to'as the times I want (want)
Doll ‚I don't know why you deny it '
You treat me 'bad, as if I didn't know (-Piera)
That you do it of evil for you not love
You are mine to'as I see them that I want (want)
Doll, I don't know why you deny it '
You treat me badly, as if I didn't know (-Piera)
That you do it of evil for you not love

[Verse 1: Brytiago]
(Brytiago, Baby, EH)
You have changed so much that you don't even know yourself
You don't let the past destroy you
And when there is' lack of affection
There you come back, to get you
Driving on the way to the old motel
I turning one and you touching me
With clothes you are coming
And in a couple of hour 'already' going to you
Let it go
But remember that even if it comes 'and go'
You are more mine than yours and I know it, I deciphered you
He throws here and does not flee '
I kissed you where e ', that you alone nake you'
And even if you make the difficult one, you have to understand

(Yah-Yah-Yah, Farru!)
You are always going to be the baby, I will not change you
I know that some pales want to chape
But none of these whores will replace you
Because you were the one who drank it; The original (PU-PU-PU-PUM)
And I still remember, between sheets sweating
The first time I ate you
I remember that motel where I left for you (I left, I left)
And enter the room (shh; calla'o), open the volume to the radius
That nobody finds out what we are going to do

[Verse 3: Lenny Tavárez & Juhn]
(Lenny Tavárez, Baby)
Calla'o, in the five letter 'snathea'o
Who told you that I have quit?
Cautious, they have never caught me
And they told me that your jevo walks
Who saw us in that old motel
He did not, I had to break you
First time you felt a woman
Tell him that he has to understand (Wuh!)

[Chorus: Juhn]
You ere 'mine to'as the times I want (want)
Doll, I don't know why you deny it '
You treat me 'bad, as if I didn't know (-Piera)
That you do it of evil for you not love
[Verse 4: Myke Towers]
(Easy Money, Baby; Myke Towers)
I remember the song
That sounded in the background when I did
And as in the 'Machine he rocked, the sugar "that said
When he was coming, he predicted it
I would do it again in that old motel
The desire resurrected, with you I killed them
And I bought the condone ', but I don't even know what
If she likes Acapella
I made it in the mouth to which I took it out, Yeh, Yeh
You ignored me 'and I insisting
I always remember you when I turn
I have to control myself, I don't stop
To my mafia doll, pa'l sex she uses gymnastics
She takes me to another galaxy, many go down with fallacy
If I don't put her, she commits a misfortune

[Verse 5: juhn]
(Juhn "The All Star", Baby) tell me
Why deny me if I am your owner?
If I have the design of that body?
I do with you to 'what I dream
And to 'what you know', I was the one who taught you
He tells me that he is not getting 'pa' that he creates
And whenever jangueo, he texts me
It gives two stick 'and the mind falters
He writes to me that on top of her and that I wish me
Among wet savannas, baby, I make you mine
And for me you are still looking for me

[Choir: Farruko, Brytiago, Lenny Tavárez & Juhn]
You, you, you ere 'mine to'as the night' that you want '
Doll, I don't know why you deny it '
You treat me 'wrong, as if I didn't know
That you do it of evil for you not love
You are mine to'as you see them
Doll, I don't know why you deny it '
You treat me 'wrong, as if I didn't know
That you do it of evil for you not love
