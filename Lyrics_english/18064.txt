Next Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can I feel so right
When all the signs are saying it's the wrong time?
So don’t look me in the eyes
It's hard enough for me to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Running outta love
Let me go, don't look back
I could stay composed
But I’m a mess and you know that
Static on the phone
Heaven knows I won't forget
The promises I had to break
[Chorus]
So maybe in the next life (In the next life)
If we meet in the next life (In the next life)
I'll be waiting there for you, I'ma see you soon
Find me at the end, we'll start again
Oh, oh, maybe in the next life
I'll be waiting there for

[Drop]
You
You
You
I'll be waiting there for
You
You
You
Next life
Next life

[Verse 2]
Keep all the memories
It's the piece of me that’s always gonna stay
Just breathe, you know underneath
When it’s you and me, it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Running outta love
Let me go, don’t look back
I could stay composed
But I'm a mess and you know that
Static on the phone
Heaven knows I won't forget
The promises I had to break
You might also like[Chorus]
So maybe in the next life (In the next life)
If we meet in the next life (In the next life)
I'll be waiting there for you, I’ma see you soon
Find me at the end, we'll start again
Oh, oh, maybe in the next life
I'll be waiting there for

[Drop]
You
You
You
I'll be waiting there for
You
You
You
