Hard Woman LyricsShe's a hard woman to please
And I thought about letting her know
She's a hard lady to leave
And I thought about letting her go

She's a tough lady to leave
But I thought about it
She's a hard lady to please
Yes she is

I gave her laughter, she wanted diamonds
I was romantic, she treated my cruelly
Where is the mercy? Where is the love?
You see, passion has a funny way
Of burning down and running low
And suddenly it goes out
And you wonder where does it go?

She's a hard woman to please
I've thought about letting her know
She's a hard lady to leave
Yes she is

I gave her laughter, she wanted diamonds
She was unfaithful, treated me cruelly
Where is the mercy? Where is the love?

I'm alone at last
Something inside of me knows
I could have loved in vain for a thousand years
I have to let her go

I've got to let her go
I've got to say goodbye
How can I say goodbye to my baby?
She's a tough cookie, hard lady
I've got to say goodbye, yeah

Alone at last and something inside of me knows
I could have loved in vain for a thousand years
I have to let her go
You might also likeAnd time goes so fast and new love starts so slow
I could have loved in vain for a thousand years
I have to let her go

I've got to let her go
I've got to say goodbye
Hard woman to please, yes you are
Hard woman,tough lady
I've got to, I've got to say goodbye
How can I say goodbye to my baby?
How can I say goodbye to my baby?
So long honeyEmbed
