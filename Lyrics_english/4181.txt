[Intro]
To the truth that is bastard
Youth, Youth, what is there?
Ñejo
Gotay
To the truth that is bastard
Pusho
NELY "The Secret Weapon"
Anuel
[Chorus 1: Ñejo, Gotay]
It really is bastard
Now we live on an airplane
I remember when I had a pair of tennis
And more than a single pants

When I looked at me in the mirror and wondered
"When will I hit a song?"
Now the girls follow me, they ask me photos
They listen to me on the radio and see me on television

It really is bastard
But you feel bastard

It really is basty (Gotay!)
Now we live on an airplane
I remember when I had a pair of tennis
And more than a single pants

Who looked at me in the mirror and wondered
When I was going to hit even a song
Now the girls follow me, they ask me photos
They listen to me on the radio and see me on television

It really is bastard
But you feel bastard
You Might Also Like [verse 1: Push]
(The MVP!) (Pusho!)
It really is bastard, before I hit me
I closed the doors of the stores in my face
Now I hesitate, I say that I am going to San Juan mall
And they close it to buy quiet
I don't leave Jet Blue and Delta, wake up
And learn that the world turns
I reached the stars
I have the most beautiful women, and we jump to bottles
My old woman says: "Pusho, I don't want you to get sick"
That no woman keeps me again
Now everything is different, and I paint it
That my daughters will have a million when they are in fifth
And my wife is going to be the most powerful (fiu-fiu)
Forcing women to take something
Envying how the queen lives
And much more to the king, who lies down and does not pisery (Pusho!)
It really is bastard, I left a alley
Letting them know that I became millo 'without having education
I put on my way and when I came to open my eyes
I already had two cars, the year and the mansion
And to 'the girls who borne see me down the street
And they say: "Now this skinny has a cabrón guille"
And it's not that I am a bastard
I feel bastard
[Verse 2: ñejo]
The bank card I had was the coupons
Now the one I have seen a couple of melons
Living in Chile, as supposed
And if the kids end, really without balls
Because we already put to the pants perha
Now we use Gucci, Versace, and also Louis Vuitton
To 'the Jordan, the ones I lack are the giuseppe
A pot, four phillies and hide the pepe
Now I am an artist, pride for my Pai '
Recording with the most bastard voice, aka Gotay (Gotay!)
Humbly, thank God for everything
And now to 'the world that sings the fucking chorus

[Chorus 2: Anuel AA]
(Anuel)
It really is bastard, I moved a thousand kilos on a plane
I was before 'jodi'o until I recorded with ñengo a song
(Real G4 Life, Baby)
The street is no longer from you, I have twelve thousand on top
And I no longer ask for bullets to any bastard (Baby)

I always believed in God and never in the devil
And I don't know if this is a blessing or a curse
I don't have any pattern (Anuel)
It really is bastard
(The untouchables, the Illuminati, mere mere ñejo)

[Verse 3: Anuel AA]
I remember when I started in the bank, like Kobe below Shaqa '
Traffic in my way of the & ark
Selling white bottles
Seeing how the heroin tecos in the veins stagnates
But I will make this money until these bastards kill me
And my son will buy a yacht
I will wait for death with an ak pa 'nonsense
And to kill you and to's your cuates (BRR)
The demons fear me, and I will buy a ktm
And to the mai 'of the baby I am going to buy a BM
If one day they kill me, baby, take care of me to the baby
I will be a millionaire although in hell it burns me (haha)
Untouchable as Mayweather
El Chapo Guzmán, moving snow jobs
I put a button at my 19
You have a FN, but I have an A9

[Verse 4: Almighty]
(Almighty)
Nandito, tell me monstri ', I laugh at life, Krusty's flow
Restaurants, we already release the plush and frosties
I only sleep in ships, Tego says that he knows, knows
In the box 'e tennis and the ticket does not fit
Before I was in the bad, but this is a scale
If there is no ticket is like having a short one without bullets
Now I am in parades and in the galas
Super connects, if I already leave home depot without peak and without shovel
Indicates ñejo, that the liquor is worth more older
I have been for years and I don't complain
Bad mine if it causes complex
That Easter and I am the Bunny Bugs of To's these rabbits and
(The Game Changer)

[Chorus 1: Ñejo & Gotay]
It really is bastard
Now we live on an airplane
I remember when I had a pair of tennis
And more than a single pants (Gotay!)

Who looked at me in the mirror and wondered
When I was going to hit even a song
Now the girls follow me, they ask me photos
They listen to me on the radio and see me on television

It really is bastard
But you feel bastard

[Verse 5: Gotay]
In truth, this bastard, had no soda
I have more, today, what I deserve
Thank God I even have a house in my name
Before what I was was pending to mess
I recorded with my favorite artist, the Ñejo
Now I only need the old
What more in this life can I ask for
I just have to say ...

[Verse 6: yomo]
It really is bastard, that God free me from the devil
Ñejo, you know what I am talking about
Since we see you on TV, baby, do you see?
Since with the weight we split the radios
Horse on horseback, we checked
The pain we felt, we always shut up
We realized that love has never existed in life
That is why the nights with the Lord talked
And we asked for mercy
And the mind and heart always in discord
They decided to join, make history to Paul
Right now we made the owners of the stable

[Bridge: Yomo]
To the truth that is bastard
Ave Maria! Who would say it?
That what I once dreamed
It would be fulfilled, song would be done
The inspiration to fight
God listened to that prayer
Believing what is not seen
To the truth that is bastard
Ñejo, to the truth that is bastard
(Fame All Stars)

[Verse 7: Jamby]
(Jamby "El Favo"!)
Yesterday I was with the boys in the alley
Smoking, speaking, imagining with a million
A mansion, a couple of cars for 'the family
Always with the vision, but it is not easy, 'tá bastard
Black introduced me with Ñejo, I no longer live with the old
We are playing even on the radio, now we went far
Although they didn't want to give me, they sultate and pereseo
They know well that I am breaking, that the assholes are not made
That here you don't enter my partner, if you are not on the list
Elektrik recorded my voices, Nelly is on the track
With those we fuck seem like a magazine
Now we live on an plane, I already have my suitcase ready

[Chorus 1: Ñejo & Gotay]
It really is bastard
Now we live on an airplane
I remember when I had a pair of tennis
And more than a single pants

When I looked at me in the mirror and wondered
"When will I hit a song?"
Now the girls follow me, they ask me photos
They listen to me on the radio and see me on television (Ajá)

It really is bastard
But you feel bastard

[Verse 8: D.OZI]
Thanks to the Nazarene, we no longer live on the alien
And the more they hate us, the more we grow
There is often Pa'l Pote, we invest in bullion
I live as a politician without abusing mustache
So many women, they don't fit in the boat
How many cars do I have in the islet?
They deposit Monday for Friday explodes
I built my block castle in block
(He's bastard) I rode my own business, I already left the warmth
(He's bastard) And all that did not start, I stopped for them pump
(This bastard) is that God multiply what I do 'e heart
(He's bastard) Do not launch with the serum of Tujuaba and Bayamón

[Outro]
DO
This is the Fame All Star
Tell me, Ñejo (El Broko)
Gotay
WHAT IS THE THAT THERE IS
Nelly the secret weapon
Fronteando de Chavos, bordering cars
Fronteing that shit, bastard, here it is!
Real until death, did you hear?
Kronix Magical
Almighty
Tell me, Jamby the favorite
The street serum, D.O!
Magnificent
And Elektrik on the Beat1embed
