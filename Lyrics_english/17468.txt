Bonnie Lyricst’es appeared on a winter evening, one evening when I saw double
I talked about nothing, you talked about everything
I don't like the girls who "wesh" I don't like the girls who bedavia, you told me you don't worry about this one gets your bike come on we talk
You told me it for a long time that I take us from us and you, I have come that purple tickets in the bathtub of a 5 -star
Fuck ducks with their whore thread sentences, when we like we don't count you saw that in which UC movie?
I count the Lovès and the street is my darling, nique the stories of love demode like a blackberry
And even if you're beautiful even if you're good don't go crazy because if you talk like a man we will settle you like a man
With me the hatred is viral, and I like it as much as this fuck
I'm not going to call you my tender, I have lokis in my head, a beach in Mexico that awaits me
I’m not going to give you up there will be very blablablas etc. I do your mother are going in a box
But since Bonnie, you know I have been kidding something crazy, I love you so fucked you that I would be able to give you a football team
You and I understand each other, for us 3 p.m. it's morning. Broolic under the pillow, I love your Latina ball too much
To life to death you and I is the same, until death separates us, I do not see why it would separate us
Before you are my girl now you're my team, if you have to smoke I would get a ball and we are leaving
Fulcked by Mondéo, I Drive, let's go for the rodeo, Bonnie will say their fuck Juliette and Romeo. Hey
You never complain about my pads, you are my co -pilot but please please your mouth when I drive, Bonnie
Divert the attention of civilians, the rappers are too funny ya that on Twitter that they are followed, in short
We share the bénefs
Down with the balls to get the moon it does not pay the invoices of EDF
Don't tell me your past, there is only the future that interests me
Your ex we hurt them the second time we kiss them, bonnie
You have to accept me as I am, your 3 options, Barcelona, ​​Florida, Mexico
You are not like these tasp, who speak stronger than a yz
Who know how to make up makeup but do not know how to do the dishes
A gangster life, that's the theme
We will go on the most beautiful beaches, will live in the most beautiful hotels
Die young and rich, live poor and old
Bonnie our kid would not sit at the back of a clio 2
Luxury barracks, luxury gamos, luxury life, first which takes us away that I nick his mother to this whore son
I am the guy of your life because for me you can die, you are the woman of my life because for you I would dig
You see the thing, the actions are better than the words, Bonnie
The living is not better than the dead
Nothing to die for young people as long as we have all lived, anyway, I will be signed with all my tunes
One thing is on life I have neither boss nor boss
The only boss I have my death hope he doesn't want me too much
So don't tell me about Chinese please not her here
I mise to offset you like asian in threat to society
And then I woke up in the feather
I had invented in my dream
