​all black fit Lyrics[Intro]
(Suto, suto)

[Chorus]
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck
[Verse 1]
All black fit, you can't see me with the lights out
All these fights, I just really wanna lie down
All that hate, but they started bein' nice now
All your love, but I feel it start to wind down

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Askin' "What's wrong?"
I said, "Nothin'"
All these people want a piece of me
No peace, no sleep, can't breathe, yeah

[Chorus]
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck

Got it from my Mom
Wish she wasn’t gone
New style what I got
I think I'm the one, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Askin' "what's wrong?"
I said, "Nothin'"
All these people want a piece of me
No peace, no sleep, can't breathe

[Chorus]
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because no one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread, maybe hangin' by my neck5Embed
