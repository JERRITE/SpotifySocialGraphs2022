Make Me Say It Again, Girl Lyrics[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Ronald Isley]
Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
Boy, you're the promise everlasting
Ah, and where you are I hope to be

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & Beyoncé]
And, oh, make me say it again, girl (Make me say it)
(Say it again, boy)
Oh, make me say it again, boy
(Say it again, boy)
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh, yes, you are
You're all, all
You're all I need, oh, yes, you are
You're all I need
[Verse 2: Ronald Isley, Beyoncé, & Both]
Whatever pain's inside, you make it better (Better, better, better)
Ah, you seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes (Goes through the changes)
Ah, giving my life directions when I am turned, oh

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Ronald Isley, & Both]
Make me say it again, boy (Say it again, boy)
Make me say it again, girl (Make me say it)
(Say it again, boy)
Make me say it again, boy
You're all I need, oh, yes, you are
You're all, all
You're all I need (You're all I need)
Oh, yes, you are (You're all I need)
You're all I need (All I need)

[Verse 3: Ronald Isley & Beyoncé]
How am I worthy of love from an angel?
You're king imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hoping that what I reveal you already know

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Ronald Isley & Both]
And, oh, make me say it again, boy (Say it again, boy)
Make me say it again, girl (Make me say it)
(Say it again, boy)
Make me say, make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh, yes, you are
You're all, all
You're all I
(You're all I need)
You're all I need
