Pacific Coast Highway (with Trevor Hall) LyricsI left the lights of L.A
To where the angels long escaped
Maybe under redwoods they play
Or along the humbolt shore
I wanna find that place

I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway
I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway
Gonna let the stars be my guide
[?] leave my worries all behind
Lovin' how the ocean meets the sky
Wishing you could see this frame of mine
All of them been asking where'd you go
If you've never been then you'll never know
I'm forever following the golden coast
Hoping that I see you down the road

I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway (I left my soul)
I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway (I left my soul)

Warm embrace of the mist
Brings comfort like a kiss
Wander through the untouched
A smile to my new friends
Walking on stones of jade
I'll never leave a trace
Hope these memories never fade

I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway (I left my soul)
I left my soul
On the pacific coast highway (I left my soul)You might also likeEmbed
