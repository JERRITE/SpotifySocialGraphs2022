Tell Me That You Love Me LyricsYeah, yeah
The situation turns around
Enough to figure out
That someone else has let you down
So many times I don't know why
But I know we can make it
As long as you say it

So tell me that you love me
Yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway
So tell me that you love me anyway
Whoa
Waking up beside yourself
And what you feel inside
Is being shared with someone else
Nowhere to hide I don't know why
But I know we can make it
As long as you say it

So tell me that you love me
Yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
But tell me that you love me anyway

Show me, look what we found
Turning around every day
I can hear what you say
Now I know why
I know we can make it

If you tell me that you love me
Yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more

Yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
But tell me that you love me anyway1Embed
