Ceasefire - (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here they roll in like a storm on the waves
Shots fired and nobody's safe
We're in trouble
No, no, no, not yet
Gripping the seams but the dreams slip away
On-board by them warm in their graves under rubble
No, no, no, not yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, we can't win this war, no
But from here until the door
[Chorus]
Ceasefire, I call a ceasefire
My love, your long day is
Over now, over now
You've been that lost voice in the choir too long, long
I call a ceasefire
It's over now, ovеr now

[Verse 2]
You had a vision of life in your mind
But this is a mess and the words nеver rhymed like a poem
No, no, no, not yet
You're taking the questions and toeing the line
Are you coming or going, you're wasting your time
You should love it
No, no, no, not yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we won't win this war
But from here until the door

[Chorus]
Yeah, ceasefire
I call a ceasefire
My love, your long day is
Over now, over now
You've been that lost voice in the choir too long, long
I call a ceasefire
Ceasefire

Come on, come on, come on
It's over now
Hey yeah
Come on, come on, come on
It's over now
Come on, come on, come on (Ceasefire)
It's over now
Hey yeah
Come on, come on, come on (Ceasefire)
It's over now

[Chorus]
I call a ceasefire
I call a ceasefire
My love, your long day is
Over now, over now
You've been that lost voice in the choir too long, long
I call a ceasefire
