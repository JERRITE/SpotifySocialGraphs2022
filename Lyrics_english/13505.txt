You are everywhere lyrics we loved tenderly
As all lovers love
And then one day you left me
Since then I have been desperee
I see you everywhere in the sky
I see you everywhere on earth
You are my joy and my sun
My night, my days, my clear blades

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
All the things around me
Even life only represses you
Sometimes I think I'm in your arms
And that you are talking to me at low
You say things that make your eyes close
And I find that wonderful
Maybe one day you will come back
I know my heart will wait for you
You will not be able to forget
The days we spent
My eyes are looking for you without stopping
Listen well my heart calls you
We can love ourselves so well
You will see life will be beautiful ...

You are everywhere because you are in my heart
You are everywhere because you are my happiness
All the things around me
Even life only represses you
Sometimes I think I'm in your arms
And that you are talking to me at low
You say things that make your eyes close
And I find that wonderful ...

English Translation:
