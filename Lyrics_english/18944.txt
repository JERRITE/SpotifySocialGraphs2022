Harvester Of Pain Lyrics...(Lyrically Accurate! / Only on Lyric Wiki!)...

I said the morning mist is burning slow
Blood on sons and brothers gonna flow
Tomorrow will I live? Lord I just don't know

I said morning comes, we march again
Into the fields of the killing man
I don't know where I'm going
Or just where I been... oh, where I've been
At times I feel so alone, yeah
Hope to find my way back home
Mama I done asked the Lord
He told me, Son, Lord I just don't know...

[Chorus]
Harvester of pain
No I ain't the one to blame
Harvester of pain
I've been caught between the blue & the gray

I said Mama I done killed a man
Was told he wasn't part of the plan
Don't worry none
I be getting by best that I can

Oh yeah, I say every day's a living hell
Oh the reaper be a' weaving his spell
Now, Sergeant take me aside, tell me son
"Peace ain't what we need is Hell"...

At times I feel so alone
Hope to find my way back home
Mama I done asked the Lord
He told me, Son, yeah I just don't know...
You might also like[Chorus] ...I wish I was somewhere else
Lord yeah, At times I feel so alone
Hope to find my way back home
Mama I done asked the Lord
He told me, Son... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus x2] ...blue & the gray
...I ain't the one to blameEmbed
