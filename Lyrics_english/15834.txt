[Verse 1]
Listen to brother the song of joy
The cheerful song waiting for a new day

[Chorus]
Come, sing, dream singing
Live dreaming the new sun
In which men will be brothers again
Come, sing, dream singing
Live dreaming the new sun
In which men will be brothers again
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
If on your way there is only sadness
And the bitter cry of complete loneliness

[Chorus]
Come, sing, dream singing
Live dreaming of the Nuеvo Sol
In which men will return to Sеr Brothers

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
If you don't find joy on this earth
Look for the brother beyond the stars

[Chorus]
Come, sing, dream singing
Live dreaming the new sun
In which men will be brothers again
Come, sing, dream singing
Live dreaming the new sun
In which men will be brothers again

[Outro]
If you don't find joy on this earth
Look for the brother beyond the starsyou might Also Likeembed
