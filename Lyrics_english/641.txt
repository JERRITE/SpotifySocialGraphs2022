Lyrics ecstasy ["ecstasy" letter ft. Santa poster]

[Verse 1: babo]
Hey, the sensei arrived, party at one hundred
Something well pa'l dj
Every Day, Every Night
Good high, here there are
I am addicted to seduction
I like talking to you very dirty
Your vato will be my partner
I am a businessman
Mine, yours, lend
You will like it and it doesn't cost you
Better not even ask questions
Because you won't see an answer
I show, I collaborate '
Babylon 'tá heavy
With ice cream without chape
Mexican pure gold
How water turns them off
Like the fire lime
Something fresh like wind
And on earth I buried them
Raja Fierro, position iron
Click dog pa 'the bitches
The bastard that alters them
My skull tattoos
[Chorus]
Ecstasy
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
Ecstasy

[Verse 2: W. Corona]
There is no downturn here
'We are about Fiestón, you know
Wake up inspiration
If we get the soft
Vénganos your kingdom
I come well batteries, I don't stop, no, no
With my carnals and a boat 'by Black Label, Yoh
Simon, the lights turn on and enter the trip
With dilated pupils and wild rhythm (e-e-e-otxtasis)
Guhacate the show, they are altered with the flow
They feel the vibration with the beat of my company the Row
There is no downturn here
'We are about Fiestón, you know
Wake up inspiration
If we get the soft

[Chorus]
Ecstasy
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS

All night, so
I will not agüitar
We give it hard, very solid
I'm going to wake up
Do not panic
YOUR LIMIT MY SATANIC FLOW
Has in its magnetic field
In the party there is pure maniac, lunatic
Wake up and let's see yourself
Mili heats people
Mammate and Embrianate
Serve and relax
And to egg
Then be assembled later
The Santa poster, El Millonario, W. Corona
The neighborhood turns on the fire
And to egg
Then be assembled later
Then be webbed later, crazy
You are with the King of the Roca
We continue giving the party
There is no one to compare
Calm down, calm my company
Santa Catarina de A Madre
[Chorus]
Ecstasy
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
Ecstasy

[Verse 4: Dharius]
This is for the Fiestón to continue
It is to follow him drunk and locochón
It is for moms to dance sensualon, bastard
To guacho what the predictions of Babylon are
The monkey beat wrapping you as a mummy
With my carnals invading your colony
Making noise in the area
Always dedicated to the most chingona race
Sacate the fire that does not miss your habit
Take out the baison and that my flow dazzles you
If you don't like it, what you add
You already know that my dogs have not been born who knocks them down
I'm enjoying chingón life
Cold beer, whiskey, tequila
Singing with your hands up
Until I am left without saliva
I will stay there, compa
You know what roll with the DHA
I bring the parrot to everything that gives
And that this dog has not drawn the fua-ja-ja-ja

[Chorus]
Ecstasy
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
E-E-E-E-E-E-E-EXASIS
