Just Asking Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm asking you to stay
Between all these whispers that won't go away
It's been a while since you and I woke up
We drift in and out, we're up and down on luck

I'll look the other way
I won't be tempted by people that lead me astray
'Cause it's been a while since you and I woke up
Do I settle down and shut you out for good?
[Chorus]
I'm asking you to stay
(Stay please, babe)
I'm just asking you to stay
(Just asking)

[Verse 2]
I'm asking you to wait
Between all the secrets that won't go away
'Cause it's been a while since you and I woke up
Do we fall in love or fuck it up for good?

[Chorus]
I'm asking you to stay
(Stay please, babe)
I'm just asking you to stay
(Just asking)

[Outro]
(Stay please babe, just asking)You might also like1Embed
