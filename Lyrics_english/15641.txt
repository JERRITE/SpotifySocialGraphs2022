I love you so much lyrics ["I love you so much"]

[Verse 1]
Never say you're doing not wanting to return
When I fell in love with you, when one hundred years I already loved you
Always take me by remembering
Seeing you dance in that Cerro Colonel
And a thousand times I kissed you, and I don't deny it, I stuck
Always take me by remembering

[Chorus]
I have seen you in front, smiling, brave, I love you so much
White dress, the half your soul, I want so much
It hurts to think that one day I find you absent
It hurts to think that one day I find you absent
[Verse 2]
I feel you when singing and listening to any song
Nice what talks about love, what I feel yesterday and today
I always take you to wake up
I saw you well
I felt faithful affection
If I broke here
I would wait for you

[Chorus]
I have seen you in front, smiling, brave, I love you so much
White dress, in the middle your soul, I love you so much
It hurts to think that one day I find you absent
It hurts to think that one day I find you absent

[Instrumental interlude]

[Saying]
I saw you well
I felt faithful affection
If I broke here
I would wait for you

[Instrumental interlude]
