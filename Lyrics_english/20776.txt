[Intro: Sfera Ebbasta]
Bu-bub-bub

[Pre-Crimeello: Sfera Ebbasta]
Eh, the guys on the street make the parmesan, Abracadabra (bu-bub-bubi)
Born with Nada, Prada clothes, Abracadabra (Bu-bub-bubi)
He hasn't called me yet, something is wrong (Brr, Brr, Brr)
It will be brought, Abracadabra (Uh, Uh)
[Refrain: Sfera Ebbasta]
It makes him disappear like a sorceress, Abracadabra (uh, uh)
There were few, mo, a mountain, Abracadabra (frr)
He says he is single, but he is engaged, Abracadabra (Ah)
I make it seem easy, I know, Abracadabra

[Verse 1: Sfera Ebbasta]
I don't think of Sara, I don't think of Chiara, I don't think of Laura (no, no, no, no)
Flowers in the palm so I calm me, you are not on the radar (ah)
I remained the same as I was on the street
In addition, I have only money (uh) and some necklace (uh, yah)
My bitch gets your nails every two weeks (brr)
You hate me because I always do the cock that I think (ah)
This is full of euros, it is full of it (how come?)
Poor the rich, they are sad, they don't know what to do (okay)

[Pre-Crimeello: Sfera Ebbasta]
The raga 'on the street make the parmesan, Abbacadabra (bu-bub-bubi)
Born with Nada, Prada clothes, Abracadabra (Bu-bub-bubi)
He hasn't called me yet, something is wrong (Brr, Brr, Brr)
It will be brought, Abracadabra (Uh, Uh)

[Refrain: Sfera Ebbasta & Future]
It makes him disappear like a sorceress, Abracadabra (uh, uh)
There were few, mo, a mountain, Abracadabra (frr)
He says he is single, but he is engaged, Abracadabra (Ah)
I make it look easy, I know, Abracadabra (Pluto)
