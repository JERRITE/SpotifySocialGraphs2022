Byl (drunk and crazy) lyrics [lyrics by "byl (drunk and crazy)"]

[Verse 1: the dandee]
Saturday night, my love
I know that story
I know you started drinking
That's why you're calling again
How a week ago
That you excited me, and for what?
I just ask you
[Chorus: The Dandee]
If you're going out
Don't take that whiskey in the rocks
That you always end up calling me (-I)
To me, drunk and crazy
I ask you, that if you are going out (Yeah)
Don't take that whiskey in the rocks
That you always end up calling me (-I)
To me, drunk and crazy
I ask you, don't make me suffer

[Verse 2: Cali]
Yeah, if you go out, don't happen to you 'with alcohol
That always gives you to throw a call
And last time you put a goal
You disappeared when the sun risen
If you are going to take
Deliver the key 'and the cell phone, I ask you
I swear it makes no sense
It hurts what pa 'ti e' funny

[Bridge: The Dandee]
And I tell you pana
Don't happen to you 'with the Buchanan's
If he is going to regret tomorrow, tomorrow

If you are going out (OH-OH-OH)
Don't take that whiskey in the rocks
That you always end up calling me (-I)
To me, drunk and crazy (EH)
I ask you, Baby, that if you are going out (no)
Don't take that whiskey in the rocks
Because again you will lie again (to me)
To me (me), drunk and crazy
If you are taking, don't call me (me)

[Outro: Cali & El Dandee]
To me (me), to me (me)
Oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, oh, no
Oh oh oh oh oh
