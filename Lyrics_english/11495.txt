The heart of rock and roll - 1999 - remaster LyricsNew York, New York, is everything they say
And no place that I'd rather be
Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three
When they play their music, ooh that modern music
They like it with a lot of style
But t's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really really drives 'em wild

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, THE heart of rock and roll is still beating
LA, Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip
Is something everyone should see
Neon signs and the pretty pretty girls

All dressed so SCANTILY ('sexily' on the live version)
When they play their music
That hard rock music
They like it with a lot of flash
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really kicks 'em in the

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, the heart o' rock n' roll is still beating

(Johnny!... oh! )

DC, San Antone and the Liberty Town, Boston and Baton Rouge
Tulsa, Austin, Oklahoma City, Seattle, San Francisco, too
Everywhere there's music, real live music, bands with a million styles
But It's still that some old rock and roll music
That really REALLY drives 'em wild

T-T-T-T-They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, HEART OF ROCK AND ROLL is still beatingYou might also likeEmbed
