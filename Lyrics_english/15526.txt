Nothing hard forever, hey
Those who escape their fate, ey
Nothing hard forever, hey

That nothing lasts forever
Nothing hard forever
Nothing hard forever

And if hard it won't always be easy
If it is easy, it will not always last
And if it lasts it will not always be

Nothing hard forever, hey
It's just luck
That nothing lasts forever
Nothing hard forever
Nothing hard forever
