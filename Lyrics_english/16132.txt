Karma Climb Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a warm taste and I'm falling away
God is a car dead in a field
I got a calm space and it won't let me shake
Man, I'm so far from what's real

[Chorus]
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
[Verse 2]
Just give me cold stares, give me polluted air
'Round and around, we go down
A little truth or dare, euphoria or despair
Karma climbs quick without a sound

[Chorus]
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away

[Refrain]
Karma climb, oh, it takes it out of me
Karma climb, a certain mystery
Karma climb, oh, it takes it out of me
Karma climb, a certain mystery
Karma climb, oh, it takes it out of me
Karma climb, a certain mystery
Karma climb, oh, it takes it out of me
Karma climb, oh, a certain mystery

And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away
And if you don't know what you're feeling
You'll never know, go, give it away

[Outro]
Give it away nowEmbed
