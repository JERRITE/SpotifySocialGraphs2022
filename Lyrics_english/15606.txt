There is still something lyrics [verse 1: sweet & Alfonso]
Between you and I is growing something
Inside you are staying
I know that you and I have a past
That may not happen again

[Pre-car: Anahí and Christian]
And to skin flower
There is good goodbye to forget it
But there was also a love
That can do miracles
[Chorus: RBD]
If you ever think about me
Maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some love
If you ever think of me
Maybe maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some master-woah-or

[Verse 2: Maite & Christopher and Anahí]
Between you and me there are old feelings
I thought they would never come back
I know you and I have a story
That left us in the middle of loneliness

[Pre-car: Anahí and Christian]
And to skin flower
There is good goodbye to forget it
But there was also a love
That can do miracles

[Chorus: RBD]
If you ever think about me
Maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some love
If you ever think of me
Maybe maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some master-woah-or

Look at me well
That I still continue here
Dying
To meet me
Look at me well
That I still continue here
Listen to me
I do not know how to live without you...!

[Chorus: RBD]
If you ever think about me
Maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some love
If you ever think of me
Maybe maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some master-woah-or
If you ever think about me
Maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some love
If you ever think of me
Maybe maybe when you see me it makes you happy
Maybe between the two
There is still some master-woah-keybed
