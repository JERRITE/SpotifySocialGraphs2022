My other half lyrics [lyrics of "my other half"]

[Intro]
I'm in love with you
When I sigh, I do it for you
You stole my heart
With the magic of your kisses

[Verse 1]
You are my center of gravity
You have everything you do not miss anything
Let me find you again
Let me touch how it should be
[Chorus]
You make me tickle love
You make everything shine
You are my gravitational center
I would give everything you kissed me

[Verse 2]
You have everything I want mommy
Those red little lips I want it for me
You know what I feel, I warned you
Looking in the eye I'm not going to lie to you
If it weren't enough, you know that I die for you

[Chorus]
You make me tickle love
You make everything shine
You are my gravitational center
I would give everything you kissed me
You make me tickle love
You make everything shine
You are my gravitational center
I would give everything you kissed me

[Bridge]
You are not from here, you have everything I want to repeat
Bring it to me once again
Would give everything because you stay

You make me tickle love
You make everything shine
You are my gravitational center
I would give everything you kissed me
You make me tickle love
You make everything shine
You are my gravitational center
I would give everything to kiss me
