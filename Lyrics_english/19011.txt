Diabolical LyricsOoh - ooh - baby
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh

Ooh - ooh - baby
I got the diabolical sound coming through your speaker

Ooh - ooh - babies
You're just like all of the rest... you're just like all of the

Ooh - ooh - babies
You're just like all of the rest... you're just like all of the rest
Ooh - ooh - baby
It's to the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh

Ooh - ooh - baby
I got the diabolical sound coming through your speaker

Ooh - ooh -  babies
You're just like all of the rest... you're just like all of the

Ooh - ooh - babies
You're just like all of the rest... You're just like all of the...

Rest, rest, rest
You're just like all of the rest

Ooh - ooh - babies
You're just like all of the rest... you're just like all of the

Ooh - ooh - babies
I got the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
- boom
(I lost my pick in the last part)
