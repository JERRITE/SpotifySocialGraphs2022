We Are It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Today I made my bet with the devil
For my four hundred tricks
Got pulled apart by Trojan horses
But now I know that we are it

[Chorus 1]
Everything I lose
Everything I win
Everything I do
I know we are it
And everything I choose
Everything I did
It brought me back to you
I know we are it
We are it
We are it
[Verse 2]
I thought that Judgment Day was coming
When we danced in '99
But the world is ours forever after
And we didn't have to try

[Chorus 2]
Everything I lose
Everything I win
Everything I do
I know we are it
And everything I choose
Everything I did
It brought me back to you
I know we are it
(Hey!)
Know we are it
(Hey!)
We are it

[Bridge]
When our life's a vicious circle
That spins too fast to see my own way out
Let me out
And when I fall into a wormhole
That spins too fast to see
And I can't run any faster
You are always there for me
'Cause there's nowhere I go, darling
Where you won't go to be there just for me
'Cause it's you and me
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Everything I lose
Everything I win
Everything I do
I know we are it
And everything I choose
Everything I did
It brought me back to you
I know we are it
(Hey!)
We are it
(Hey!)
We are it
(Hey!)
We are it
(Hey!)
We are itEmbed
