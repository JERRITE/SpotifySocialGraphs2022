[Enter: Bad Bunny]
Hey

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
Tití asked me if I have a lot of 'girlfriend', a lot of 'girlfriend'
Today I have one, another morning, hey, but there is no wedding
Tití asked me if I have a lot of 'girlfriend', heh, a lot of 'girlfriend'
Today I have one, another morning
[Saying: Bad Bunny]
I am going to take to to'a pa 'a vip, a vip, hey
Greet Tití
Vamo 'to throw' a selfie, say "cheese", ey
That the ones that already put them
In a VIP, a VIP, Ey
Greet Tití
Vamo 'to throw' a selfie, say "cheese"
That those who have already forgotten me

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
I really like Gabriela
The Patricia, the Nicole, the Sofia
My first girlfriend in Kinder, María
And my first love was called Thalia
I have a Colombian who writes to 'the day'
And a Mexican what did I know
Another in San Antonio who still loves me
And those of pr that everyone 'are mine'
A Dominican who is a chocolate grape
UVA, Bombón grape
That of Barcelona that came by plane
And he says that my bug is bastard
I let them play with my heart
I would like to move with all 'pa' a mansion
The day I married I send you the invitation
Boy, leave that, ey
