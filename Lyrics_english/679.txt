[Chorus]
Baby, what else?
I don't know about you
'Taba with someone, but I'm already free
Post to relive old time ', I don't get out a long time ago
Tell me where is it ', ah-ah-ah
What a while ago I don't know about you (na 'of you)
'Taba with someone, but I'm already free
Post to relive old time ', I don't get out a long time ago (SHH)

Daddy, we please ', parking' and the foremus'
Pa 'La Dry Something Babemo', and when we get drunk '
A reggaeton puts 'and we watched' where we can love each other

Pa 'La Dry Something Babemo', and when we get drunk '
One of reggaeton puts' and we watched 'where we could' love
We could eat

What's wrong can it happen?
What's wrong with us? I'm outside, salt
We have pending things' for reviewing
You ere 'a pust difficult to replace (yes)
I don't know if it convenient you (EY)
We give us a friction by Provence
And if the thing gets tense, in my bed the reward
Or vice versa, why do you think about it? (Nope!)
Pasamo 'by the neighborhood by grass (grass)
Put it in the hookah pa 'that dissolves
Chemistry is still preserved
And I make it rich to come back '
Although tomorrow I leave, take advantage that here I am
Put pa 'ti, that's why I wrote you
