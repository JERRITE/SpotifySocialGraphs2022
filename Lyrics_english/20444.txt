Mi Corazón Lyrics [Intro]
All Eyes I am
Well yeah all eyes me
It's the PMP, the PMP
Marwa Loud, All Eyes I am
All Eyes me, it's Dj Sem

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be explained to me
I don't want to take a risk
I'm not afraid to finish solo
I want no help
I want no truce
There's only you who can tune my melos me
Now I would like to get better from here
Stop far away, cling to the islands
I want the sea to testify, against me
That she complain to see us all month
That she complains of me, that she complains of you
I want to go dancing but I have too much look at me
Where are my friends? Where are my enemies?
I have nothing special yet all eyes I am
[Chorus]
Mi Corazón, Mi Corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone
Yeah, mi corazón, mi corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone

[Verse 2]
It's not against you but it's important
I don't do it for you, I do it so that I can hear me
You observe me around you you make the reporter
You jealous because yours has nothing to bring you
Yeah yeah, in my madness I find lots of melodies
I'm waiting for the night to go around my city
I saw your guy he's not too polite
You are in the love yeah you love it a thousand (eh, eh)
And yeah you like it a thousand (eh, eh), you see your friends more (eh, eh)
You would have given him everything, he typed in the thousand

[Chorus]
Mi Corazón, Mi Corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone
Yeah, mi corazón, mi corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone

All Eyes on me, I'm lost I can no longer meet my enemies
Yeah, all eyes me, I mockest in my city and I think of my life

[Chorus]
Mi Corazón, Mi Corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone
Yeah, mi corazón, mi corazón
Mom told me attention, mi corazón
They make tons of them, because I am surprising
I don't want to calculate them anymore, I turned off the phone1embed
