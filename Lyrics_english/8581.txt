Rigoletto, Act 3: “La Donna è Mobile” lyricsack, as a Fjun so easily 
 Is every woman! 
 Vanity to find 
 One that his faith consisted 
 Than in the smile 
 Than in the tears 
 After all, the tracks are discerned 
 Of her misery 
 Light as a feather 
 Is every woman 
 Vain a single one 
 His faith consisted! 
 His faith consisted! 
 Yes, his faith consisted 
 Easily it is deceived, as 
 Believe her appearance 
 Then she for the key 
 Seeking only pastime 
 But though she switches about 
 In the love rush 
 She still the light 
 Spreads in the man's life! 
 Light as a feather 
 Is every woman 
 Vain a single one 
 His faith consisted! 
 His faith consisted! 
 Yes, his faith bestodyou Might Also Likeembed
