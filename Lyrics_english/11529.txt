Dominos Lyrics[Intro: Conor Oberst]
Can you hear the crickets?
All I hear is crickets
Like a river
Shining through the edges of my sight
The sky is pitch black, dark
Yet somehow really peaceful
At the same time

[Verse 1: Conor Oberst]
It gets dark in the morning
Trade sleep for drinks in a bar
I'm sure as hell my breath stinks
Watch it float like smoke in the fog
I can feel a tornado
And it's shivering up my arms
I've been playing dominoes
I'm just trying not to wreck no cars
Putting fear in my nose
And trying to keep up with all my thoughts
[Chorus: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
If we're going somewhere, I'm ready
If it's just dirt, I'm not

[Verse 2: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
I scrape my eye when I touch the sky
And lose a little vision for the man
I can call it in my mind
I don't want to hold nobody's hand
I can toss in the morning light
I'll play dead when I'm buried in the sand
I'm seeing shadows of man a who's
Homeless, buried and numb
A forecast of forgotten land
I hope it shows up in the setting sun

[Chorus: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
If we're going somewhere, I'm ready
Honey, if it's nowhere, I'm done

[Variation: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
I can hear a voice but it's speaking code
(Poured concrete on top, concrete on top, concrete)
Like I'm talking to strangers on a foreign phone
I can talk to angels when I'm all alone
They take me to a place in the city
And when we're done they take me home

Can't find a forest with the singing birds
Instead I'm just a low voice in the crowd
Can't hear my own voice in this crowd

[Verse 3: Phoebe Bridgers]
I get edgy on dark streets
Coming home, I feel my heartbeat
I say I'm stoned for the last time
I do it again and repeat
[Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm carpooling to kingdom come
Into the wild purgatory
Experiencing a magic rainbow
All you got to do is follow

[Chorus: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
And if you're not feeling ready
There's always tomorrow
And if you're not feeling ready
There's always tomorrow4Embed
