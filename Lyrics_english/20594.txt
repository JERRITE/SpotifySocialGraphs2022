One Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
We go in circles, you and me
We say the same things, but never what we mean
I know that you wanna play games
But not tonight, not tonight, not tonight, please

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me a taste, wanna know I’m alive
‘Cause I keep dancing on the edge of the knife
Almost so wrong that it’s right
Let’s forget the world for
[Chorus]
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night

[Post-Chorus]
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night

[Verse 2]
I know that we can’t have it all
But I’d rather have this than nothing at all
And when you leave me, I’m alright
But not tonight, not tonight, not tonight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me a taste, wanna know I’m alive
‘Cause I keep dancing on the edge of the knife
Almost so wrong that it’s right
Let’s forget the world for

[Chorus]
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night

[Post-Chorus]
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one night
For one nightEmbed
