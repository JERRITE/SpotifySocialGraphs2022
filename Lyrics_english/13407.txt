TranslationEnglishte congratulated Lyrics ["I congratulate you"]

[Intro: Shakira]
To complete you I broke in pieces
They warned me, but I ignored
I realized that yours is false
It was the drop that exceeded the glass

[Pre-Caro: Shakira]
Don't tell me you feel it
That seems sincere, but I know you well and I know what you lie
[Chorus: Shakira]
I congratulate you, how well you act
I have no doubt
With your paper continues
It looks good this show
I congratulate you, how well you act
Dе that is no doubt
With your paper continues
You look good that show
I congratulate you, how well you act

[Verse 1: Shakira]
I don't buy that cheap philosophy
Sorry, on that motorcycle I no longer amount
Two -sided people do not support it
I who put his hands to the fire for you
You treat me like one of your cravings
Your wound did not open my skin, but my eyes
I have them red to cry for you

[Pre-Caro: Shakira]
And now it turns out that you feel it
Sounds sincere, but I know you well and I know what you lie

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Shakira]
I congratulate you, how well you act
I have no doubt
With your paper continues
You look good that show
I congratulate you, how well you act
I have no doubt
With your paper continues
You look good that show
I congratulate you, how good you act (ey, he says, ra-rauw)

Talking clearly, I don't need you (Yeah)
You lost someone authentic (ah)
Something told me why not fluiam '(Wuh!)
He's going to chop when he remembers ’How we ate '(Yah!)
As before '(ey)
You back supporting you from the steering wheel (Ey)
Burning the tranquilizer
I did not bloc you from the 'pa' that I see 'the other in the Mercede' (Yah!)

[Bridge: Shakira]
Don't tell me ’more history’, I don't want to know
How I have been so blind and I have not been able to see
They should give you an Oscar, you have done it so well

[Choir: Shakira & Rauw Alejandro]
I congratulate you, how well you act
I have no doubt
With your paper continues
You look good that show
I congratulate you, how well you act
I have no doubt
With your paper continues
You look good that show
I congratulate you, how good you act1embed
