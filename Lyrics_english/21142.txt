A Bigger Mood Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need a bigger mood to block out the sun
I don't wanna see what I've become
And you could fight your way
Get back what you really want
It's nothing special anyway

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're always in my way
I'm falling faster everyday
Yeah, you're always in my way
I gotta spit you out
You bring me down
Everything just crashes to the ground
'Cause you were always in my way
[Verse 2]
I can feel a break
A bruise from another day
It's hard to say just what I feel
It all seems broken now
When I'm stuck on the in-between
Staring at something out of reach

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're always in my way
I'm falling faster everyday
Yeah, you're always in my way
I gotta spit you out
You bring me down
Everything just crashes to the ground
'Cause you were always in my way

Go!

[Outro]
Yeah, you're always in my way
Yeah, you're always in my way
You bring me down
Everything just crashes to the ground
'Cause you were always in my way
'Cause you were always in my way
'Cause you were always in my way
