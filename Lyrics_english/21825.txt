Getting Ready to Get Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama got a look at you and got a little worried
Papa got a look at you and got a little worried
The pastor got a look and said, "Y'all had better hurry;
Send her off to a little Bible college in Missouri"

[Verse 2]
And now you come back, saying you know a little bit about
Every little thing they ever hoped you'd never figure out
Eve ate the apple cause the apple was sweet
What kinda God would ever keep a girl from getting what she needs?
[Chorus]
And I'm
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down

[Verse 3]
Now, people cross the street when you walk in their direction
Talk between their teeth and throwin' epithets
And the doctor thinks the devil must've got you by your senses
But to live the way you please doesn't sound like possession

[Verse 4]
It's four long years studying the Bible
Infidels, Jezebels, Salomes and Delilahs
Back off the bus in your own hometown
Say "you didn't like me then, you probably won't like me now"

[Chorus]
But I'm
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down

[Bridge]
All the men of the country club, the Ladies in the 'xiliary
Talk about love like it's apple pie and liberty
To really be a saint, you gotta really be a virgin
Dry as a page of the King James version
You might also likeNo "ooh la-la's," no "oh, hell yeses"
No "I can't wait's, I gotta see you againses"
Just turn the other cheek, take no chances
Jesus hates your high school dances

[Verse 5]
Said your soul needed saving, so they sent you off to Bible school
You learned a little more than they had heard was in the Golden Rule
Be good to everybody, be a strength to the weak
Be a joy to the joyful, be the laughter in the grief

[Verse 6]
And give your love freely to whoever that you please
Don't let nobody tell you 'bout who you oughta be
And when you get damned in the popular opinion
It's just another damn of the damns you're not giving

[Chorus]
And I'm
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down

[Verse 1]
Mama got a look at you and got a little worried
Papa got a look at you and got a little worried
The pastor got a look and said, "Y'all had better hurry;
Send her off to a little Bible college in Missouri"
[Verse 7]
And now, you come back, saying you know a little bit about
Every little thing they ever hoped you'd never figure out
The Red Sea, The Dead Sea, the Sermon on the Mount
If you wanna see a miracle, watch me get down

[Chorus]
And I'm
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Ah, I, I'm
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down
Getting ready to get down4Embed
