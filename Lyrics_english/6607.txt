Bittersweet Symphony Lyrics[Verse 1]
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet
You're a slave to the money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

[Chorus]
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
[Verse 2]
Well I've never prayed
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

[Chorus]
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet
Trying to find some money then you die

[Chorus]
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, noYou might also likeEmbed
