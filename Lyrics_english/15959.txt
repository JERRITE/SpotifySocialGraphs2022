The thousand and one nights Lyrics [letter of "the thousand and one nights"]

[Verse 1: Ilse & Mimí]
For letting the charm of a treasure escape
We were a couple of crazy for letting us kill
We are not going to find another beach that has palm trees moving in the wind
We are not going to achieve a to measure again

[Chorus: Ivonne, Ilse & Mimí]
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon joined us, and neither you nor I knew how to fly
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon separated us, and neither you nor I knew how to cry
[Verse 2: Ivonne and Ilse]
For letting jealousy look in your mirror
Your empty look, your habit of fleeing
Your way of always loving, always crazy, always at the wrong time
I had to end one of the two

[Chorus: Ivonne, Ilse & Mimí]
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon joined us, and neither you nor I knew how to fly

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Ivonne, Ilse & Mimí]
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon joined us, and neither you nor I knew how to fly
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon separated us, and neither you nor I knew how to cry
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon joined us, and neither you nor I knew how to fly
The thousand and one nights that I spent with you (one thousand and one nights, a thousand and one nights)
The moon separated us, and neither you nor I knew
