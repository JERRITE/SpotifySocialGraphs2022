When the Lyricsaire tide goes down, in this pretty summer afternoon
Your memory is a gray photo
That hours are blurring
How difficult to draw your features
Noon after leaving
Air, yes your eyes were black figs
Yes Lemon segments
I don't remember the length of your eyebrows
I can't even speak just
Of something other than your smell
The mind when the tide goes down
By pure conservation instinct
Try to cauterize every footprint
That leaves behind the passage of love
The mind when the tide goes down
Showing pain structure
Activate a defense mechanism
So that the heart does not drown
Beautiful, with your perfect profile such Hebrew
Desalized, full of projects
Loaded shoulders and old shoes
Air, I lack the air
In this beautiful summer afternoon
I can't describe you
Your memory is a gray photo
Barely profiled
That hours are blurring
Oh no

Air, I try to draw
Your features but I can't almost
As much as I try
How difficult is to recognize
With everything we love
That you have not left me just a mark
Air, now when the tide goes down
And the wreck is already total
What a shame! You Might Also Likeembed
