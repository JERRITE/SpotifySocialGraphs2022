Disparate Youth LyricsDon’t look ahead there’s stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
So let them say we can’t do better
Lay out the rules that we can’t break
They want to sit and watch it wither
Their legacy’s too hard to take
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for

In their heads, hedging their bets, in their
Eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks, what then
You ask they don’t know
Oh tell me that I turn my back, well the
Odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled, but now
The odds all stand beneath me
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
They’re frozen to the core
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost

We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for

We hear that rumble
Don’t hear what you say
Now here we come
Can’t throw nothing in our way
