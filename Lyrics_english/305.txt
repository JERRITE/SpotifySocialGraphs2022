Night Calls Lyrics[Pre Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind
I don't even gotta say it

[Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate, no
You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
Ima' pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now
[Verse 1]

I could never fall in you love
That's what I was tryna' tell you
Now you feel like enough is enough
You think I want you for your body
I play games, call you when I need somebody
I say things I know you won't tell nobody
I know your heart and your soul
All the things niggas don't know
I was there before your glow
But lately I've been on the go
Studio all day, with Kalim all day
Penning hits all day, I can not be your bae

There's so many times you tried to shut me down
I'm wasting your time
But still I take you down
I smoke and I drink girl then I'm just being myself
Yeah, faded off that rum yeah

[Pre Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind
I don't even gotta say it
You might also like[Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate, no
You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
Ima' pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now


[Verse 2]

Always rolling
Never let my own feelings control me
She's got a man but I keep scorin'
Keep doing you babe
Keep fooling yourself, girl
Now shawty fuck me through another man
Posting pictures with him on the gram
She be tryna' make me jealous
'Cause I won't tell her I got feelings
I text her like I'm on the way
I'm toasted I don't wanna' wait
And then she reply she's in love with the pipe
But she hates that I don't wanna date
[Pre Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind
I don't even gotta say it

[Chorus]

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate, no
You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
Ima' pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now3Embed
