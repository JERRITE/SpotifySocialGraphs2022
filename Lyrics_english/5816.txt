Drive By Lyrics[Intro]
This gon' be your shit, I know
It's like I can't do no wrong, I know
You gon' put this on repeat, I know
This gon' be your favorite song, I know

[Verse 1]
Even when you not here, you get all of my time
Sweeter than a number 9 with a large sunrise
Every nigga in your past, hit 'em with the crossfire
Now I'm shootin' to your crib like it was a drive by
[Chorus]
I can't get you off of my, out of my mind
I'm sayin' stop playin', girl, you out of line
Couldn't erase these feelings even if I tried
You stay on my mind
Thinkin' about you
Yeah, thinkin' about you
You stay on my mind
In the morning (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
Late at night (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
On the job (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
Baby, you stay on my mind

[Verse 2]
Love the way you do your thing, we could build an empire
Paparazzi on our head, cover of the Enquirer
Said you could tell I miss you, girl, you preachin' to the choir
Know them bitches finna hate, all you do is inspire

[Chorus]
I can't get you off of my, out of my mind
I'm sayin' stop playin', girl, you out of line
Couldn't erase these feelings even if I tried
You stay on my mind
Thinkin' about you
Yeah, thinkin' about you
You stay on my mind
In the morning (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
Late at night (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
On the job (Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you)
Baby, you stay on my mindYou might also like20Embed
