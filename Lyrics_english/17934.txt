THE PROFE LYRICS [LETTER OF "EL PROFE"]

[Verse 1]
I know that I never told you like that, sometimes I sing just for me
I just want you to hear me now that I am still my instinct
The animal instinct would not fail, I would like to talk to you but without speaking
I know I can make you understand me if you follow my game

[Chorus 1]
I want to be your teacher, rather, professor
The one who shows you from love, whatever you know and hide
I would like you to lie to me when I ask your age
I want to become so vulgar
I'm going to fool you, silly, just to touch you a little
[Verse 2]
You see like that you will never know about me, my fantasy describes me like this
This is the part that no one has seen that you now know
I see you and it is my reaction to pretend to have all the control
Take advantage of you stimulates to sign up my tricks

I perceive at what time you start wetting
And then I can't until I feel that I make you mine
In the role of naive you really light
And I begin to suspect that you are my favorite student
And you fell into my trap

[Chorus 2]
I want to be your teacher
I want to be your teacher

[Verse 3]
I want to be your black truck, I want to be a picar√≥n pig
I want to do the most dirty things in an elegant way
I want you to touch me, I want to touch myself and end up in you
Oh, if you knew how it excites me just thinking about
I would like you to lie to me when I ask your age
I want to become so vulgar
I'm going to fool you, silly, just to touch you a little

[Chorus 2]
I want to be your teacher
I want to be your teacher
I want to be your teacher
I want to be your professoryou mihht Also like1embed
