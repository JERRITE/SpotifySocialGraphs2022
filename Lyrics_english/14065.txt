Bad Things (That Make You Feel Good) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Knee down by the neon lights
Come meet me in the dark
Met a girl with a burning heart
You know she lit a spark
If my heart's not jumping
I ain't going home
If my toes ain't tapping
I ain't going alone

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't deny it
Ooh, you can't deny it
[Chorus]
I feel the fire and it's burning little holes in my life
I see the future but I never had a child or wife
I taste the bitters and I wanna have some sugar to taste
I smell the roses, I could use a little punch in the face
I hear the music and it makes me want to get up and shake
Jumped in the fire just to see how much more I could take
I think I might just be misunderstood
I wanna do all the bad things that make you feel good

[Verse 2]
I hear the band and I knew it all
But give you all I got
And if it's difficult to walk the line
We'll reconnect the dots
If my eyes ain't open
I don't feel the shame
When my heart starts beating
Going down in flames

[Pre-Chorus]
We lit the fire
Ooh, we lit the fire

[Chorus]
I feel the fire and it's burning little holes in my life
I see the future but I never had a child or wife
I taste the bitters and I wanna have some sugar to taste
I smell the roses and I could use a little punch in the face
I hear the music and it makes me want to get up and shake
Jumped in the fire just to see how much more I could take
I think I might just be misunderstood
I wanna do all the bad things that make you feel good
You might also like[Bridge]
If you wanna keep me up all night
It's alright, it's alright
If you wanna keep me up up all night
It's alright, it's alright if he knows
It's alright, it's alright if he knows
It's alright, you're alright

[Chorus]
I feel the fire and it's burning little holes in my life
I see the future but I never had a child or wife
I taste the bitters and I wanna have some sugar to taste
I smell the roses and I could use a little punch in the face
I hear the music and it makes me want to get up and shake
Jumped in the fire just to see how much more I could take
I think I might just be misunderstood
I wanna do all the bad things that make you feel goodEmbed
