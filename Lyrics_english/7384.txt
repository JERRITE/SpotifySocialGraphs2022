Oh, Its Christmas! Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, it's Christmas
Oh, it's Christmas
Again, oh, it's Christmas
Hope this feeling never ends

[Verse 1]
Love is on the air is feeling all over the avenue
People everywhere, now is now the season to be blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Spring is so beautiful, seal all the leaves for bloom
Summer is hotter, the weather is hotter in June
When is Autumn is falling, and colors start turning the cool hue
Winter is on its way
[Chorus]
Oh, it's Christmas
Oh, it's Christmas
Again, oh, it's Christmas
Hope this feeling never ends

[Verse 2]
What's that over therе, mhm
Thought is saw a couple reindeer fly across the moon
Got no morе time to spare
I got to put the tree up in the living room

[Pre-Chorus]
Spring is so beautiful, seal all the leaves for bloom
Summer is hotter, the weather is hotter in June
When is Autumn is falling, and colors start turning the cool hue
Winter is on its way

[Chorus]
Oh, it's Christmas
Oh, it's Christmas
Again (again and again), oh, it's Christmas
Hope this feeling never ends

[Bridge]
Presents coming early morning
Is joy across your face
Watch out for his love
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, it's Christmas
Oh, it's Christmas
Again (again and again), oh, it's Christmas
Hope this feeling never ends
Oh, it's Christmas
Oh, it's Christmas
Again (again and again), oh, it's Christmas
Hope this feeling never ends

[Outro]
It's Christmas
Merry Christmas everyone
Oh yeah it's that time of year again
You know it's your favorite
Merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry Christmas
I was born near Christmas so is my favorite
I think it runs through my veins
Anything Christmas makes me happy
And people's hearts are open
I hear the drum with boys drumming drama drumming
I hear the reindeer come and come, come in now
I hear the twin deeper time
And there's a choir of angels singing fa la la
Fa la la, fa la la, fa la la
Oh la la laEmbed
