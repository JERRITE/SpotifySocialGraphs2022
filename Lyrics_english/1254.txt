So Are We Lyrics[Intro]
Ok do you want to vibe, so do we
Ok do you want to get high, so do we
Is you tryin to fuck somethin, so is she
They say they ain’t fuckin with me, so we see

[Verse 1]
Ok first I pop my card don’t fuck up my seats
And don’t be talkin over the loud they ain’t tryin to hear you speak
When it come to the aux cord, please don’t you fuck with that neither
I ain’t tryin to hear none of your rappin friends lyin over weak ass beats
My shit’s official, my bitch is bad and my brain is washed from her words
You got the gift of gabbing ain’t sayin much you get the last on all of my nerves
But that ass is fat and the head is good you even grab the wheel when I swerve
Them toes is perfect, that polish poppin, that pussy print sit so sturdy, I’m like....
[Hook]
Who you wanna rob, we in these streets
They screamin fuck a 9 to 5, yes indeed
Oh she know I got a wife but bring the freaks
I guess you just livin life, bitch so are we
Ok she be fakin like BYB
Love all my bitches on the side and they love me
Never do it out of spite, she keep it G
I guess you just livin life and so are we

[Innanet James Verse]
And you are the prototype roll the weed and smile today
We do the things I know you like
Let’s try something new, you not afraid
Let’s rob a bank you Frank Jarvis
What a rush, what a thrill baby what I feel when I feel faded
If you tryin to fuck bring your friends through
The one that get a hunnid mil likes when she posts pics
It ain’t nothing new bring her mother too
Andalay we got a bunch to do, Adele we go for 25/8 ate cat for 25 days
And we was living life the fast way the way we way ahead and past they
Innanet I wave and pass jays
Roll the weed with ladies everyday, roll the weed with ladies everyday, I’m like...

[Hook]
Who you wanna rob, we in these streets

Oh she know I got a wife but bring the freaks
I guess you just livin life, bitch so are we
Ok she be fakin like BYB
Love all my bitches on the side and they love me
Never do it out of spite, she keep it G

Yea yea look hit my phone at 4 in the morning, got the henny pourin sippin and I’m zoning
Plenty of gas we can Texaco it if you brought the pack then Ima let you roll it
I got bitches all my exes know it, you can keep it G and be the next I go with
We can have a future little Mexico it
And if you hoe’ing innanet’s gonna let me know
I be tired of hitting the club scenes and seeing the same bitches I know
I got broads down in Atlanta, out to LA and Chicago
I know I don’t keep in touch enough but it’s just the life that I chose
Tell that fuck nigga to kicks rocks and come kick it with a rolling stone
Yea that’s my life, fucked I hit it twice
Put that bitch on ice
That’s a must give em nothing but good dick and advice
Just one night while you throwin rice she be throwin slights
All them text, posts on your Instagram your nigga think you mad at him sike, I’m like

[Hook/Outro]
Who you wanna rob, we in these streets

Ok she be fakin like BYB
Love all my bitches on the side and they love me
Never do it out of spite, she keep it G
I guess you just livin life and so are we1Embed
