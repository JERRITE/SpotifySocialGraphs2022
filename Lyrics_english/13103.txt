Self Harmageddon Lyrics[Intro]

I won't eat until you say that you love me
I won't sleep until you can't sleep without me
I won't breathe until I take your breath away
I want to be alone but I want you to stay
I won't eat until you say that you love me
I won't sleep until you can't sleep without me
I won't breathe until I take your breath away
I want to be alone but I want you to stay
I won't be free
Until I die
I won't be free
Until I dieYou might also like7Embed
