TranslationEnglishrakata Lyrics ["Rakata" letter]]

[Pre-car]
Look, daughter, ha
World already goes, it's already
What about the world and
With this desire to fuck now

[Chorus]
Look, I throw you a rakatá
To see if you look at me, hmm
And if you looked
Boy, I see you
Say, world already goes, hey, it's already
Everyone's coming
With this desire to fuck (I say)
I throw you Rakatá (Huh)
To see if you look at me, huh
And if you looked
Don't lie
[Verse]
Grr
And the leats reluctantly replace
Furruco rumbles incessantly
Good sympathetic
While my psychopathic flow
Keep flowing through all your veins
Look how vibrates, I come with everything (Ataja Gata)
And without condemnation, without sorrow I
Without sorrow, I give it to you,
I put, I'm your dinner
Bruja good qumin (to-to-to-to-to-to)
Daddy, if you want this slow (to-to-to-to-to)
Daddy, if you want I hit you (to-to-to-to-to-to)
Daddy, if you want this slow (to-to-to-to-to)
Take it out, take it out, take it out, take it out (to-to-to-to-to-to)

[Pre-car]
Hey
Look, daughter, ha
World already goes, it's already
What about the world and
With this desire to fuck now

[Chorus]
Look, I throw you a rakatá-tá-tá-tá-tá-tá-tá-tá-ta-ta
