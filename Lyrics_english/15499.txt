THE STREET OF THE SIRENAS LYRICSLA CALLE DE LAS SIRENAS (X4)

They cross unicorns that are white and jump without stopping
Made the narrowest side of the street
If you look closely, from the sign, you will find shoes
Fairies working on a blue dress
It seems that they only raise the (look)
When the elves pass (they pass)
Towards the castle at the end of the street
It's right where it's hotter
Ohuuhoo
Imagine the sirens on the moon
Ohuuhoo
Soaking stars with paint
And princesses go dancing with dresses that fly
In a blue carriage

The dragon of that castle is sad and has a very bad mood
It is his crazy fire that gives heat
And the witch her neighbor, afternoon and night, a remedy will seek
Because the fire does not calm the fan or fan
I could spend my life with that (giant)
That everyone fears (fears)
And if I approach until I touched your hand
It tells me it's just a human being

Ohuuhoo
Imagine the sirens on the moon
Ohuuhoo
Soaking stars with paint
Ohuuhoo
Imagine the sirens on the moon
Ohuuhoo
Soaking stars with paint
