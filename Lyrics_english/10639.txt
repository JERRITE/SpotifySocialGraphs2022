Trust None Lyrics[Intro]
Pooh, you a fool for this one (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Go Grizz
Winners Circle

[Chorus]
Never trust a bitch, never trust a bitch (Nope)
Never trust a bitch gossipin' and talkin' shit (Shut the fuck up)
Never trust a snake, never trust a snake (Hell nah)
They gon' try to ride yo wave and eat it off yo plate (Off yo plate)
Never trust a ho, never trust a ho (What the fuck?)
Never trust a ho 'cause she can't keep her legs closed (Haha)
Never trust a fake, never trust a fake (Huh?)
They gon' talk behind yo back then smile up in yo face (Fuck on)
[Verse 1]
I don't care about no bitch
Don't give no fuck about no ho
Yeah, I'm a brazy bitch
Put this four-five in yo' throat
Don't know why these bitches hatin'
Don't know what they hate me for
These bitches don't want no problem
They know I'm 'bout it for sure (Yeah)
I'm stackin', I'm stackin' that cake
These broke bitches know they cannot relate (Cannot relate)
Ain't no bitch in my way
Me and you are not the same
But bitch, you knew that anyway (Anyway)
Passin' these bitches, I'm in my own lane
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, bitch? I made my own wave
Give bitches fame just by sayin' my name
Been rappin' for years and bitches still lame (Hahaha)
That ain't my problem, weak bitches gon' be weak bitches
Sneak dissin', pistol whip a bitch, now her teeth missin'
Free my brother, the realest nigga I ever knew
Disrespect his name and them missiles comin' after you

[Chorus]
Never trust a bitch, never trust a bitch (Nope)
Never trust a bitch gossipin' and talkin' shit (Shut the fuck up)
Never trust a snake, never trust a snake (Hell nah)
They gon' try to ride yo wave and eat it off yo plate (Off yo plate)
Never trust a ho, never trust a ho (What the fuck?)
Never trust a ho 'cause she can't keep her legs closed (Haha)
Never trust a fake, never trust a fake (Huh?)
They gon' talk behind yo back then smile up in yo face (Fuck on)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Say it's beef with who? (Huh?)
On my head, need proof (Yeah)
I got a good Drac'
You'll end up on the news
Why they think shit sweet?
Wish a bitch would try to play me, ooh (Ha)
Paid ya life for these sneaks
Wish a bitch would step on these (On these)
Why they wanna run up?
I'm just chillin' (I'm just chillin', yeah)
I see myself in all these bitches
They my children (They my fuckin' child)
I can't waste time with hoes
'Cause I need me a million (I need a million)
Sneak dissin' the reason
Can't take you serious (Hell nah)
Why they wanna see me fail? (Fail)
I'm like, "Fuck it, oh well" (Oh well)
Bitch, I never need a co-sign
Bitches want theirs and mine
Tryna to eat off my plate
I can tell who real and who snake (Who fake)
Why these bitches tryna take my place?
Why they always lyin' to my face? That's why I...
[Chorus]
Never trust a bitch, never trust a bitch (Nope)
Never trust a bitch gossipin' and talkin' shit (Shut the fuck up)
Never trust a snake, never trust a snake (Hell nah)
They gon' try to ride yo wave and eat it off yo plate (Off yo plate)
Never trust a ho, never trust a ho (What the fuck?)
Never trust a ho 'cause she can't keep her legs closed (Haha)
Never trust a fake, never trust a fake (Huh?)
They gon' talk behind yo back then smile up in yo face (Fuck on)7Embed
