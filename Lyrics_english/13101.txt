Dreamy Suicide Pact LyricsI want to kiss every single scar that you have
I want to make you mine
I want to wake up next to you
I want to be high

I want to climb deep inside what makes you sad
I want you to be fine
I want to help you forget all the nights you spent alone
I want to change your mind

On suicide, on suicide, on suicide with me
On suicide, on suicide, on suicide with meYou might also likeEmbed
