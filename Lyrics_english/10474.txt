Boing Beat Lyrics[MC Boing]
Here comes another sick banger from me
MC Boing, tonight's MC
Smash release, euphoric dreams
Getting up hype on the internet stream

[MC Boing]
MC Boing at the front of the queue
Looking at my mates and they're looking like you
Looking at the lights and the music in my head
Then everything stopped and the angel said
[Hannah Diamond & MC Boing]
Will you take me high?
Hold my hands
Dance with me (A-a-a-a-a-and the angel said)
You're MC Boing
So dance-

[MC Boing]
Take me up to the roof in the sky
We're all dancing in a room that's nice
MC Boing is a bird that flies
On the wings of a bird in the angel's eyes

[MC Boing]
Sickest, sickest night
Never, never, never ends
Never, never, never, never, never, never ends
Sickest, sickest night
Never, never, never ends
Never, never, never, never, never, never ends
MC Boing
MC Boing
MC, MC, MC Boing
MC Boing
MC Boing
MC, MC, MC Boing
Going outside into the fresh air
Feel it on your face, flowing up into your hair
Energy levels way beyond ten
By myself with my mates and friends
Sickest, sickest night
Never, never, never ends
Never, never, never, never, never, never ends
Legendary mates all in the same room
With the Harlecore energy sonic boom

To the boing
And I'm in a funky car
Driving so fast that I'm in a funky car
Music in the radio car
Angels singing
La la la la
Boing
And I'm in a funky car
Driving so fast that I'm in a funky car
Music in the radio car
Angel singing, angel singing
Angel singing, angel singing
Angel singing, angel singing
Angel singing, angel singing
So dance with me
To the sky

[MC Boing]
MC Boing is bouncing all night
Everyone here is safe and nice
Makes me wanna have a great life
Angel singing, bass is tight1Embed
