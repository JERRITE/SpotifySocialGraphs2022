​hunting for pearls Lyrics[Verse 1: Jonna Lee]
Deep blue diver, with our hopes in your hands
Won’t you take me with you to another land?
Pure sapphire hiding in the sands
Of the darkest depths ever known to man
Jointly there is nothing we can’t do
What composure and sharp slight of hand
At night I lay awake and hear you call my name

[Pre-Chorus: Jonna Lee]
In the strangest lands, I will grasp my chance
Sing the unsung words I have searched to spell
[Chorus: Jonna Lee]
And I shackle myself, I risk it all
Bringing us closer to the core
Returning treasures to the shore
And together we take back what is ours
Hunting for pearls on the ocean floor
For us to cherish and adore

[Verse 2: Jonna Lee]
Days are hollow, nights come to my defense
I shut my eyes and focus not to lose her sense
It’s her we follow, she holds the secret spell
I know the place she goes, I wave her farewell
Jointly there is nothing we can't do

[Pre-Chorus: Jonna Lee]
In the strangest lands, I will grasp my chance
Sing the unsung words I have searched to spell

[Chorus: Jonna Lee]
And I shackle myself, I risk it all
Bringing us closer to the core
Returning treasures to the shore
And together we take back what is ours
Hunting for pearls on the ocean floor
For us to cherish and adore
