Look at me Lyrics [Lye "Look here"]

[Intro]
I had promised him (not) that he was going to spend the rest of my day 'with you (eh; oh-oh-oh)
How many pepas have I gotten? (Nope)
I tell you that I forget you (OH-OH-OH)
If I look here, alcohol intoxication (alcohol intoxication)
But look at me here (EH), alcohol

[Chorus]
Look here, poisonic of alcohol
Say for a love that now and 'heartbreak
I ended up in a doctor who gave me bang for my head
But for my heart a dose of not thinking about you prescribed
Y-and-and a Pastillita for sleeping
And to accept that you are happy without me
[Verse 1]
I'm like Kanye asking God to return me to Kim
In a note by Lean (Lean), Baby, if you moved, pass me the pin
And if it's over, send me a text that says at the end: "I will not answer it"
You already know where I am going to be, drinking, smoking and fucking to camouflage

[Bridge]
That without you I am shitty
You ere 'my gps pa' that I don't miss
Each drink reminds me
My nightmare and 'see another opening your leg' (Fuck)

[Chorus]
Look here, poisonic of alcohol
Say for a love that now and 'heartbreak
I ended up in a doctor who gave me bang for my head
But for my heart a dose of not thinking about you prescribed
Y-and-and a Pastillita for sleeping
And to accept that you are happy without me

[Verse 2]
I have to block you, it hurts me to see your story '
Although he deletes you from all the Rede ', how did he hear his memory?
The new season came out, but I don't know if seeing it
I am like prone without you without the pearl
Baby, tell me if you remember
As your dad caught us by giving a Blunt
I told the father -in -law that and 'medicinal
And your dead laugh, the eye 'like Orienta'
After that they put Federale '
We fell probative and had to escape
And I was looking for you at Yaris all fucking '
From below your do this'o with me
Without you I am like my first partie '
Empty, empty, empty

That without you I am shitty
Y-and-and, Baby, tell me if you remember
My nightmare and 'see another opening your leg'

[Chorus]
Look here, poisonic of alcohol
Say for a love that now and 'heartbreak
I ended up in a doctor who gave me bang for my head
But for my heart a dose of not thinking about you prescribed
Y-and-and a Pastillita for sleeping
And to accept that you are happy without mymbed
