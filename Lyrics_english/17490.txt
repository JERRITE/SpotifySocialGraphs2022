Feeling of Falling Lyrics[Verse 1: Kim Petras]
All the other ones never stayed too long
Just a hit and run, leading me along
Don't tell me you're different
It all sounds the same
Probably shouldn't listen
Probably shouldn't stay

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I hate the feeling of falling (Feeling of falling)
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
[Post-Chorus]
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love

[Break]
I hate the feeling of falling
I hate the feeling of falling
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love

[Verse 2: Kim Petras]
Don't know what to say, at a loss for words
If we walk away, maybe it won't hurt
I can't keep on holding on nothing but air
If we hit the bottom, I don't know what's there

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I hate the feeling of falling (Feeling of falling)
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love

[Post-Chorus]
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love

I hate the feeling of falling
I hate the feeling of falling
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love

[Bridge: Kim Petras]
Be my one mistake
I don't want to wait anymore, anymore
If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't want to wait anymore, anymore
If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't want to wait anymore, anymore
If you wanna stay, be my one mistake
I don't want to wait
The feeling of falling in love

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I hate the feeling of falling
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
I'll take the blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love
The feeling of falling
The feeling of falling in love (Woo-ah)
The feeling of falling (Be my one mistake)
I can't keep bleeding, I'm sorry
If you wanna stay
The blame if you want me
'Cause I hate the feeling of falling in love22Embed
