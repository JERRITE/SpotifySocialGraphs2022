Locust Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweet caress
Grazes my skin
It's loveless
These hooks sink in
Behind an angel's disguise
An insect preys
Mandibles cut like a knife
The reckoning

[Pre-Chorus]
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down
[Chorus]
They come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust

[Verse 2]
Surrender
These veins are bled
Devoured
Nothing sacred
Strings pull the marionettes
See how they dance
Upon the winds that beget
Our pestilence

[Pre-Chorus]
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down
You might also like[Chorus]
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust

[Bridge]
Bleeding from my eyes
This plague is sent to erase us
Bleeding from inside
These vermin can't infiltrate us

Faith appears and holds a candle
Hark the angels sing

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Tear the veil
The lies derail
Purity ever will prevail
Trumpets sound
The shattered crown
Halos of truth now they surround
The charade comes down
[Chorus]
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locustEmbed
