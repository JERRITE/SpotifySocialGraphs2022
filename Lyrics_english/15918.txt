It's a Lyricsy adventure is an adventure to meet you
Walk and obey you, and live for you
It is an adventure to be with you
Walk and be your friend, and live for you
And it's an adventure every day if I have you
If I have you

It is an adventure, the sea can cross
I walk on water, if you go with me
It is an adventure to cross the threshold
That leads to the impossible if you go with me
If you go with me
It is an adventure that does not end
By trusting your word and following you
It is an adventure when I believe no matter
What I see why you are there
It is an adventure every day if I have you
If I have you

It is an adventure, the sea can cross
I walk on water, if you go with me
It is an adventure to cross the threshold
That leads to the impossible if you go with me
If you go with me

It is an adventure, the sea can cross
I walk on water, if you go with me
It is an adventure to cross the threshold
That leads to the impossible if you go with me
I walk on water, if you go with me
There is nothing impossible if you alone
