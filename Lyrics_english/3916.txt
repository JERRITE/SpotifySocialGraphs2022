What I Said Lyrics[Intro]
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Okay, here we go
Gather all around, you don't want to miss this show
If you don't know, it's about to get serious
(Get serious, get serious)
My energy can make you delirious
Take a chance if you're curious
Follow my lead up out of your seat
We're about to P-A-R-T-Y
Y'all ain't seen nothing like this
Ultimate non-stop excitement
My pyro-technique is about to
Blow-oh-oh your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
It's curtain call, the stage is set
Spotlight's on, you ain't seen nothin' yet
This moment is somethin' that you won't forget
Oh, no, you won't because

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' that I'm somethin' you gotta see right now
It's the only place that you wanna be right now
I'm gonna make some magic (Uh-oh-oh)
That's what I said
I can be anything like a chameleon
I'm one in a million
It's gonna be dramatic (Hey)
That's what I said, that's what I said

[Post-Chorus]
That's what I said, that's what I said

[Verse 2]
Okay, here we go
From the east to the west in your area
Everywhere I go, I'm causin' hysteria
Lets raise the roof so high we get aerial
I'm so fly, y'all carry her
No breaks or intermission
I've got your full attention
This moment is somethin' that you won't forget
Oh, no, you won't because
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm sayin' that I'm somethin' you gotta see right now
It's the only place that you wanna be right now
I'm gonna make some magic (Uh-oh-oh)
That's what I said
I can be anything like a chameleon
I'm one in a million
It's gonna be dramatic (Hey)
That's what I said, that's what I said

[Refrain]
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said

[Bridge]
See, a party ain't a party without me, the element
And anybody who's anybody be yellin' it
And when they can't even scream, they be spellin' it
That I be gettin' it hot, there's no comparison
Oh, so gather round, gather round now
'Cause I'm about to break it down, break it down now
There's too much room to be standin'around
We ought to be shakin' the buildin', feet stampin' the ground, ugh

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' that I'm somethin' you gotta see right now
It's the only place that you wanna be right now
I'm gonna make some magic (Uh-oh-oh)
That's what I said
I can be anything like a chameleon
I'm one in a million
It's gonna be dramatic (Hey)
That's what I said, that's what I said
[Outro]
Hey, that's what I said, that's what I said
Hey, that's what I said2Embed
