Let You Know Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah I'm just tryna let you know
Let you know
Le let you know
That we're going up the wrong road yeah
And I'm just tryna let you go
Let you go
Le let you go

[Post-Chorus]
But I don't wanna say no...
[Verse 1]
In the beginning it was all okay, yeah
Any time, any place
I was with you loving you
But never trying to smother you
But we keep moving at the same pace, yeah
Always in the same flow
Never letting what we had grow, no

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's always the same
Why can't you change when know how I feel?
When you know this is real
Why would you walk in and change up the deal?
Keep my feelings contained
I don't mess with the game
But still you show up, it's late
And you mess with my brain
And I can't remember to say...

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm just tryna let you know
Let you know
Le let you know
That we're going up the wrong road yeah
And I'm just tryna let you go
Let you go
Le let you go
But I don't wanna say no more

Let you know
Le let you know
That we're going up the wrong road yeah
And I'm just tryna let you go
Let you go
Le let you go

[Post-Chorus]
But I don't wanna say no more
But I don't wanna say no more
But I don't wanna say no...

[Verse 2]
Two shots and I'm on tonight, yeah
Two shots and Ima tell it to you right
Two shots still no love
I'm drinking to the bottom but you don't show up
Oh no you don't show up

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's always the same
Why can't you change when you know how I feel?
When you know this is real
Why would you walk in and change up the deal?
Keep my feelings contained
I don't mess with the game
But still you show up this late, and you mess with my brain, and I can't remember to say...
[Chorus]
Yeah I'm just tryna let you know
