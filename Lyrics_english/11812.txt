Guayabo Lyrics ["Guayabo" letter]

[Verse 1]
Sitting again in the same bar
Another cigar that turns off and
How many days did they spend?
My friends left and you left me
I don't know how much you started
Today we are on Tuesday
I know you blocked me (wuh)
[Chorus]
I know they told you
That I drink too much
That I spend here I
With so much chimbitita by my side
And I have not forgotten you
I know they told you
That now I think I drink too much (hey)
That I spend here, smoking, pretending that I had forgotten you
MÐµ is going to kill this guayabo

[Verse 2]
Baby, tell me what are you waiting for
If you know that it hurts and not cooperates
I've been two and I'm going for the third
Ey, what drunk
Pa 'top your story is first
And I without seeing her for not seeing me
And I confess that it hurts
But I accept it
Although the truth had you in another concept
I thought you were the official
But I saw that it is not true
I know you are the group of all concerts

[Pre-car]
And they told me now smoke
And that is harder
I was remembering you, baby, naked
I know it's crazy, madness
I called you and you came from a

I know they told you
That now I think I drink too much
That I spend here I
With to 'these whores by my side
And I have not forgotten you
I know they told you
I'm smoking too much
That he had it sitting here, smoking, pretending that I had forgotten you
This guayabo is killing me

[Bridge]
And what face you will put, say baby
When you see me again
If you leave, think well
You will not return here
Although if it returns' okay, all fine
And what face you will put, say baby
When you see me again
If you leave, think well
You will not return here
Although if it returns' okay, all fine

[Pre-car]
And they told me now smoke
And that is harder
I was remembering you, baby, naked
I know it's crazy, madness
That does well but torture me
[Chorus]
I know they told you
That I drink too much
That I spend here I
With so much chimbitita by my side
And I have not forgotten you
I know they told you
That now I think I drink too much
That I spend here
Smoking, pretending that I had forgotten you
This Guayabo is going to kill me
