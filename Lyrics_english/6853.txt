I’m inlove but... Lyrics[Intro: The Bradley Davis]
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more

[Chorus: The Bradley Davis]
Ride around in my whip
Told you, you got it flipped (Yeah)
Trust that I won't do shit
I've used up all my attempts (Yeah)
Don't give a fuck, and I know
You're gonna be a no show (Yeah)
Hanging out with them hoes
It's your pic you might as well pose (Yeah)
You got my mind messed up
Look in my eyes and fess up
Do you want this relationship with me
Abandon the ship or should I sink
Not your brother, your dude, or your homie
I'm more than a friend so don't throw me
Don't call me that shit then the next night be talkin' 'bout
"Do you wanna come and hold me?" (Yeah)

[Verse: Snøw]
"Come and hold me?"
Baby girl you don't know me
Hate that you call when you're lonely
All you do is disappoint me
But I'm in love and you're fucked up
God I'm feeling so damn numb
Sorry that I am not enough (oh)
But tell me how you feel, the silence is real
I smoke on the herbs just to deal (aye)
You say you love me, I know you ain't mean it
But for some odd reason I feel like believin'
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Your feelings they change like the seasons
Oh...

"Would you just stay with me?"
"Stay with you? What for? Look at us, we're already fighting-"
"Well that's what we do! We fight! You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch, and I tell you when you're being a pain in the ass! Which you are.... ninety nine percent of the time. I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings."

[Chorus: The Bradley Davis]
Yeah, Ride around in my whip
Told you, you got it flipped (Yeah)
Trust that I won't do shit
I've used up all my attempts (Yeah)
Don't give a fuck, and I know
You're gonna be a no show (Yeah)
Hanging out with them hoes
It's your pic you might as well pose (Yeah)

You got my mind messed up
Look in my eyes and fess up
Do you want this relationship with me
Abandon the ship or should I sink
Not your brother, your dude, or your homie
I'm more than a friend so don't throw me
Don't call me that shit then the next night be talkin' 'bout
"Do you wanna come and hold me?" (yeah)

[Outro: The Bradley Davis]
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more4Embed
