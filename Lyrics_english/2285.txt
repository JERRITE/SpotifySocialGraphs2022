Only When I Look into Your Eyes Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
You
You couldn’t imagine the sadness
That happens when you’re driving alone
There’s no where to stop
When you’re crying, the radio is carrying you home
It’s hard to stay focused so close to the ocean
Let the wind take control
You never would notice
[Chorus]
Remember what it felt like when you left me?
Everything around me felt so lonely
And if you ask me if I ever cried
Only when I look into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You
You couldn’t imagine the sadness
That happens when you’re flying back home (Home)
There’s no where to hide
When a stranger complains about who controls the light
It’s hard to stay focused
When roses are thirty thousand feet below sight
You never would notice (No-oh)

[Chorus]
Remember what it felt like when you left me?
Everything around me felt so lonely (Felt so lonely)
And if you ask me if I ever cried (I ever cried)
Only when I look into your eyes
Remember what it felt like when you left me?
Everything around me felt so lonely (Felt so lonely)
And if you ask me if I ever cried (If I ever cried)
Only when I look into your eyes
You might also like[Bridge]
Only when I, only when I look into your eyes
Only when I, only when I look into your eyes
Only when I, only when I look into your eyes
O-o-o-oh, o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-oh, o-o-oh

[Chorus]
(O-o-o-oh)
Remember what it felt like when you left me?
Everything around me felt so lonely
And if you ask me if I ever cried
Only when I look into your eyes2Embed
