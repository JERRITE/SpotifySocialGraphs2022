Each ... lyrics [letter of "every ..."] 

 [Verse 1] 
 I feel that 
 From that moment I saw you 
 Decipherment 
 That you would never be for me 

 [Pre Coro] 
 What maybe to meet you was my mistake 
 Or maybe love was wrong 
 [Chorus] 
 And every time I think of you 
 My heart turns on 
 And nothing is sadder than today 
 Talk about you 

 [Verse 2] 
 I feel that 
 You cut my breath 
 Every time 
 That you approach just a little to me 

 [Pre Coro] 
 What maybe to meet you was my mistake 
 Or maybe love was wrong 

 [Chorus] 
 And every time I think of you 
 My heart turns on 
 And nothing is sadder than today 
 Talk about you 

 [Bridge] 
 But this story has to stop 
 I don't really understand this 
 There is no case this situation 
 Because this is so illogical 
 You Might Also Like [Choir] 
 And every time I think of you 
 My heart turns on 
 And nothing is sadder than today 

 [Outro] 
 Talk about you, talk about you 
 Talk about you, talk about you5embed
