Lyrics rifle [words of "rifle"]

[Verse 1]
She sees the size of my toys
Obviously that I’m player
I'm no longer afraid to fail
Drowned in pain of pain
Your diamonds, dry them
When she shines everything up there
She sees us I am doing how beautiful the sky is
I have my hands on a stick, teflon on my back
In the wind and the embers we grew up
But I want to die near the water
Huh, I have to go from a coma, with or without love
Stopped by time, ego, the love of mauve
I go to the wall I hear in his whispers that I put his heart in tatters
Yesterday you had my name on the lips
Since dawn you have been the same
Wherever we go you told me to love is not all
Nothing is mine, nothing is for us
My health for a minimum wage, I get rich and solo
Teille I kiss drunk, hops the one that takes place in front of
My life in a record, my sound in your bando
To our dead, to our leftovers in photo
Tête high, born to die standing
We will face anyway
I forgot how to live
As long as the sun is removed with or without love
As long as you are not saved
I left I took risks
But I'm not going to come back poor
I said it I will promise
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
I have time I don't sleep
My tied throat, my sorrows in numbers
If you hear me I'm whole
I told you darling wait for me I'm at war
You wait for me, you can clear me
Then for a long time I knew I saw clear
Leaving it, I'm hurting
I speak to the moon I see your reflection in the water
[Chorus]
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle

[Verse 2]
When the regrets come back
I meet and go around in circles
I will never say say baby come back
Too bad for the rest I have not renounted my jacket
You felt alone in it
When time passes the wounds fade
We don't forget we live with
To our dead, to you
Gouache on the phalanges: violent
I grew up I more the same haunted as before
I chose to do it at their detriment

[Chorus]
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle

[Verse 3]
I will face anyway
As long as the sun is
With or without love
As long as you are not saved, nan
I left I took risks
But I'm not going to come back poor
I said it I will promise
You didn't see me change the shoulder rifle
I have time I don't sleep
Before I told me I love you
You you say I help you
Go ahead realize your dreams
Father and mother age
The best or the worst thing that happens to me
What she gives me
I want more I was bad you played the blind might also like29embed
