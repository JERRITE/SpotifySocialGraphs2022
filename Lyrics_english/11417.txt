I Am a Child Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
God gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?
[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smileYou might also likeEmbed
