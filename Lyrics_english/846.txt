Stead that I want to tell you something, baby
I have all night seeing, admiring your flow, Yeah
Just pay attention, dance the dembow with me
That everything I want to tell you is in the song, Baby

You have something (go)
That caught me (Pó)
Tonight is from Farra
It is that body (po)
That attracted me (Jo)
And obviously your gaze
I want to confess (te)
That for my mind (te)
I want to approach, baby
And discourage me abuse, girl

[Chorus]
But I'm going to steal a kiss
That reminds you this moment
Dancing the Dembow (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
And then a whistle and a smile
How divine your flow (oooh)

Dancing the Dembow (the Dembow)
And then a flight, girl
Teach me that smile, baby
