CAPTAIN AMERICA Lyrics[Intro]
It's Hot
It's Hot
Mhm
(808 Mafia!)
Ay
Yea
Yea

[Chorus]
Oh good lord this frightning
Try stealing my thunder, my lighting
Why's that so surprising
Gottem upset like Buster Tyson
It's a big boy bag, better back up, brought back up but they not my hype men
They can hit shots on you
Three dots on you like I'm not done typing
Send it
That's one way to get ended
Tryna go viral hit you with a whole minute extended
Get trending
I don't like guns but a couple my friends is big big fans of the second amendment
Captain America I'm back with a motherfucking vengeance
[Verse 1]
Ooh
How he the hero he so rude
I feel like a boss in the Legion of Doom
When I'm out at Yamashiro eating miso soup
Mushroom tea got my ego bruised
Like I missed a free throw and my team gon' lose
But a label on the phone tryna make a new deal like AOC with the Co2
Hey, stay outta politics
Yea, or you can unfollow this shit
Suck it and swallow this dick
Laura can shut up and dribble my balls you bitch
You don't understand what the problem is
If you believe in the opposite cool
You got the right to pop off in the comments
I got the right to not even acknowledge it
Ooh

[Chorus]
Oh good lord this frightning
Try stealing my thunder, my lighting
Why's that so surprising
Gottem upset like Buster Tyson
It's a big boy bag, better back up, brought back up but they not my hype men
They can hit shots on you
Three dots on you like I'm not done typing
Send it
That's one way to get ended
Tryna go viral hit you with a whole minute extended
Get trending
I don't like guns but a couple my friends is big big fans of the second amendment
Captain America I'm back with a motherfucking vengeance
You might also like[Verse 2]
Read it and weep
Article 7, it's freedom of speech
Talk on the internet you wouldn't say it to me on the street
Not even being discreet
Don't even try it
Don't even tweet and delete
You should be quiet cause nobody buying that shit but I keep a receipt
And you can't take that back
That's the policy
No half-assed apology
So don't lie to me
No more cap, just facts and honesty now
This economy
Just a lot of these billionaires who think this monopoly
Picking pockets like it's a robbery
Paying a politician to break democracy, mm

[Chorus]
Oh good lord this frightning
Try stealing my thunder, my lighting
Why's that so surprising
Gottem upset like Buster Tyson
It's a big boy bag, better back up, brought back up but they not my hype men
They can hit shots on you
Three dots on you like I'm not done typing
Send it
That's one way to get ended
Tryna go viral hit you with a whole minute extended
Get trending
I don't like guns but a couple my friends is big big fans of the second amendment
Captain America I'm back with a motherfucking vengeance1Embed
