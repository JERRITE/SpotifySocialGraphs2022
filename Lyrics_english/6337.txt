Better In College Lyrics[Intro: Robert Delong, Robert Delong & Ashe]
I liked you better in college
I thought I knew what I wanted
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)

[Verse 1: Robert Delong, Ashe, Robert Delong & Ashe]
It was love, and it was hate
It was real, but it was fake (Real, but it was fake)
We were never gonna make it out in time
We were barely getting by
Now we’re caught in between
Gettin’ old, and gettin’ free
We were never gonna make it out alive
We’re still barely getting by
(Wе’re still barely getting by)
[Chorus: Robert Delong, Robert Delong & Ashe]
I likеd you better in college
I thought I knew what I wanted
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)
I thought that love was forever
I thought that you made me better
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)

[Verse 2: Ashe, Robert Delong & Ashe]
I was right, and you were smart
I was high, and you were art
We were never gonna make it out alive
We were barely getting by
Now I’m bored, but getting paid
Now you’re bored, with getting laid
No, we were never gonna make it out alive
We’re still barely getting by
By, by, by (We’re still barely getting by)

[Chorus: Robert Delong, Ashe, Robert Delong & Ashe]
I liked you better in college
I thought I knew what I wanted
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)
I thought that love was forever
I thought that you made me better
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)

I’m still there fallin’
We’re still lost, darlin’
I’m still there fallin’ (I’m still there fallin’)
We’re still lost, darlin’ (I’m still lost here, darlin’)

[Bridge: Robert Delong, Ashe, Robert Delong & Ashe]
Well, I did the math
You and I weren’t built to last
We were a broken machine (We’re still barely getting by)
And I can’t get back
The fake you I made in the past
Can’t live life inside of a dream

[Chorus: Robert Delong & Ashe]
I liked you better in college
I thought I knew what I wanted
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)
I thought that love was forever
I thought that you made me better
Back then, I was a fool
(Ah-ay, ah-ay, ah-ay)

[Post Chorus: Robert Delong & Ashe, Ashe]
I’m still there fallin’
We’re still lost, darlin’
I’m still there fallin’ (I’m still there fallin’)
We’re still lost, darlin’ (I’m still lost here, darlin’)
[Outro: Robert Delong, Ashe]
I’m still there fallin’
We’re still lost, darlin’Embed
