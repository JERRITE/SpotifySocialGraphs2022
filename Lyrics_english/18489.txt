The Fortunate Lyrics[Chorus]
Hey-ey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time
Yeah, you are the fortunate

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a way out
For something that isn't so cruel
Well I'm a little tired, you see
Complacent and miserable
I think you're missing out
I think you're dumbing it down
You're past the point of owning up to your words
There's no getting it by us now
[Pre-Chorus]
So, if it's okay by you

[Chorus]
Hey-ey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

[Verse 2]
So full of misadventure
And feelings insecure
Ooh, it's so easy
Push the pin
Fake the tense
And give us nothing more

[Pre-Chorus]
And if it's okay by you

[Chorus]
Hey-ey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time
You might also like[Bridge]
And if it's the one thing
That I've been sure of
Well it's okay
I know you've got the time
If it's all one in the same thing
Then I've been waiting for the fallout, we're history
But it's gone on for so long, so long
That I don't think you'll ever be the same

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time
Ho-oh, ho-oh, yeah, pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

[Outro]
(Heyo, heyo, yeah, pay no mind)
Heyo, heyo (We are the second, you're minutes behind)
Heyo, heyo, heyo (So you say, "Yeah I'm alright")
Heyo, heyo, heyo (You are the fortunate all the time)Embed
