World Without You Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Girl, come through, and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone-
Girl, come through, and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone-

[Chorus: Blai$y]
They say
Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
It was your eyes that had got ahold of me
I'm helpless so that's what it seems
I wanna let my heart out cause it's bursting at the seams
And I heard you was a seamstress, girl of my dreams
But I will never know you, because I never sleep, yeah I never sleep
So that's why you can never see me and I can never see you
And now the sky don't look so blue in a world without you
[Interlude: Shiloh Dynasty]
Girl, come through, and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone-

[Chorus: Blai$y]
They say
Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
It was your eyes that had got ahold of me
I'm helpless so that's what it seems
I wanna let my heart out cause it's bursting at the seams
And I heard you was a seamstress, girl of my dreams
But I will never know you, because I never sleep, yeah I never sleep
So that's why you can never see me and I can never see you
And now the sky don't look so blue in a world without you

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Girl, come through, and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone-
Girl, come through, and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me-You might also like10Embed
