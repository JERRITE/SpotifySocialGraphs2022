TRAGA MALUCA LYRICS ["TRAGA MALUCA"

[Verse 1]
My compadre comes that I have something to tell you
But please don't tell anyone
I have not been able to sleep three days ago and it is that
I carry something inside that no longer lets me live

I don't know what happened that night I saw her
Something weird I began to feel inside me
Without telling anyone, another drink serves me
And without anyone realizing it, I was looking at her laugh
[Pre-car]
Worst of all, neither way
Well she belongs to another
And I don't know what I'm going to do (I'm going to do)
That's why I came today to ask you to see if you
You can explain this that just happened to me
(Of happening)

[Chorus]
Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure
Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure

[Verse 2]
Luckily my brother who comes to find it
Take a seat that this is long and sad to count
Because what I have is no invention
It is rather something I feel
Well inside

[Pre-car]
Worst of all, neither way
Well she belongs to another
And I don't know what I'm going to do (I'm going to do)
That's why I came today to ask you to see if you
You can explain this that just happened to me
(Of happening)

Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure
Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure

[Bridge]
All you can do is time back
In order to see her again and in this way
Be able to clarify things at once
And thus end this that more than love is suffering

But that has no cure, oh that nothing cures it
But that has no cure, or this is crazy, oh that nothing cures it

[Chorus]
Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure
Compadre what you have is a maluca swallow
I'm sorry to tell him this but that has no cure

But that has no cure, oh that nothing cures it
Oh this is madness
