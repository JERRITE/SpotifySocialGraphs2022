Chasing Amy Lyrics[Intro]
Are you sure?
Are you sure about me? yeah
I mean, are you sure? ooh
Are you sure about me? yeah

[Verse 1]
Quit playing
These tricks are for kids, you silly rabbit
But you keep saying
That you don't got no tricks
With your silly habit
Full disclosure, I kinda bite
I toss and turn throughout the night
And fuss and fight, when moonlight strikes
And then when my 90s dream goes from red to white
Imma act like I'm your wife
Before you've even read your rights
And keep you up like every night
Smokin' all your weed straight up just for flight
Is that alright?
[Verse 2]
Are you sure about me?
Are you sure?
And when mercury's in retrograde
I might not want to fuck or shave
I might be a tease and misbehave
And kiss you when I feel ashamed
For being mean and throwing shade
I might have thoughts on fucking Zayn
From One Direction
And ask you way too many questions
Just need to know your pure intentions, love

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been hurt before
And I get dick galore
And I got bipolar disorder
Are you sure?
Cause I can make you weak
And fuck you in your sleep
And act like wolf and sheep
I'm straight up savage
Are you sure about me?
Are you sure babe?
'Cause I'll be yours babe
Only if you're sure babe
Are you sure motherfucker
I'll be yours babe
Are you sure?
Just be sure about me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Hot and cold, like icy hot
But cool as hell, like Mikey Rocks
The vampires butterflies that you provide
Appear upside down, deep way inside
And when we lock eyes, I might make you sigh
And roll your eyes
Soon one day you'll scrutinise, my love for
Champagne papi, up I'll try
When you call me babe and say you're mine
I'll simmer down and realise
That we don't really have to hide behind
These white lies, or fake disguise
Only if you're sure right?
I need you to be sure right

[Verse 4]
Cause I'm not used to this
You know bein' like ?
Getting texts back real fast
Back rubs make my ass clap
And I don't wanna say something stupid like Frank
And I don't wanna scare you so stupid like Frankenstein
Are you mine?
Like only all mine, all in this time
If not then just cut the line
Cause  I'm bi-try-curious and I'm kinda sorta delirious
Baby is you serious?
99 problems getting dick ain't one
I got 99 problems getting rich ain't one
Nothing's really a problem if you don't think its one
But are you sure about me?
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been hurt before
And I get dick galore
And I got bipolar disorder
Are you sure?
I can make you weak
And fuck you in your sleep
And act like wolf and sheep
Like straight up savage
Are you sure about me
Are you sure babe?
Are you sure babe?
'Cause I'll be yours babe
If you're sure babe
Are you sure motherfucker
I'll be yours motherfucker
Are you sure?
Just be sure about me

[outro]
I've been hurt before
Look I've been hurt before
I've been hurt before
Just be sure about me, yeah
Just be sure about me, yeah1Embed
