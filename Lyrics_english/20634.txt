Love Not Loving You Lyrics[Intro]
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't need you to call me and tell me I'm alright
I don't need you to knock on my door in the dead of the night, no
You were always giving me all of your insecurities
How could you do it?
You knew what you were doing to me
[Pre-Chorus]
And my body couldn't move with your hands on me
All I had were your words and I couldn't speak
Now I'm gonna give it all up, gonna love not being in love
So baby, bye, bye, bye, bye

[Chorus]
(You) You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you

[Verse 2]
When I wake in the morning
From a lonely night
Came to me in a dream
I guess I'm the love of my life
I don't want your attention
I don't need your affection, no
So baby, bye, bye, bye, bye
You might also like[Chorus]
(You) You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you (Not loving you)
You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else (Like someone else)
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love
Now I love not loving you

[Bridge]
Sad songs bring me back to life
Lose myself, I lose my mind

[Chorus]
You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you (Not loving you)
(You) You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you (Not loving you)
You broke me out of a fever
You make me feel like someone else
You make me dance like I mean it
Now I love, now I love
Now I love not loving you4Embed
