The Bad Boys Lyrics[Verse 1]:
You and I have been
Here and countless others
Have been here and they have broken through

And all that we have staked
On this love has blistered
When it's gone then it's truly gone

Seems like it's always been this way
I know the reason that you stay
And they don't

[Chorus]:
You and I baby we're the bad boys
You and I baby we're the bad boys
You and I baby we're the bad boys
They don't even know
You and I baby it's a long way
You and I baby to the top hey
You and I baby we're the bad boys
They don't even know

[Verse 2]:
You and I have lied
Here and countless others have lain here
And they have reason to

And all these precious blights
Though they find the concert
All they’ve got, is all they truly got

I know we’re yellow and they gold
I know it’s hard just growing old
And they don’t

[Chorus]
