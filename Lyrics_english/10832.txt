Let It All Go Lyrics[Verse 1: Birdy]
I've been sleepless at night
Cause I don't know how I feel
I've been waiting on you
Just to say something real
There's a light on the road and I think you know
Morning has come and I have to go

[Pre-Chorus: Birdy]
I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard
[Chorus: Birdy and Rhodes]
But if we're strong enough to let it in (in, in)
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now

[Verse 2: Rhodes]
If I look back to the start, now I know
I see everything true
There's still a fire in my heart, my darling
But I'm not burning for you
We've started it wrong and I think you know
We waited too long, now I have to go

[Pre-Chorus: Birdy and Rhodes]
I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard

[Chorus: Birdy and Rhodes]
But if we're strong enough to let it in (in, in)
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now

Who says? Who says?
Who says? Who says?

[Bridge: Birdy]
Who says truth is, beauty after all
And who says love should break us when we fall

[Chorus: Birdy and Rhodes]
But if we're strong enough to let it in (in, in)
We're strong enough to let it go
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now
We're strong enough to let it go13Embed
