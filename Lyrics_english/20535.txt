I Loved You (feat. Melissa Steel) - Hamilton Remix Lyrics(I loved you, loved you
I loved you, loved you
I loved you, loved you
I loved you, loved you)

Just another day, of not being in your way
So I'm all alone, all alone oh, ooh yeah
Just another week, we don't hardly speak
But I'm holding on
Stop treating me so wrong!
Give me your lovin', give your mind
Give your kissin', give me some time
'Cause I can't live a lie if my heart walks out your life
Give me your lovin', give me some easy
Give me your kissin', give me a reason
To make me wanna stay
Wanna go back to the day I loved you (baby all I need, baby all I need)

I loved you (more)
When you had no money (more)
Used to say I loved you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)
I loved you (more)
Every day was sunny (more)
Used to think about you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)

Don't make me twist your arm to stay, a little me will be OK
Walk out the door, uh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
I think it's time I found that guy, who I can rely on day and night
To be by my side baby, and be a real man to his lady

Give me your lovin', give me your mind
Give your kissin', give me some time
'Cause I can't live a lie if my heart walks out your life
Give me your lovin', give me some easy
Give me your kissin', give me a reason
To make me wanna stay
Wanna go back to the day
You might also likeI loved you (more)
When you had no money (more)
Used to say I loved you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)
I loved you (more)
Every day was sunny (more)
Used to think about you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)

I could walk away, turn my back
But I can't do that, oh no I can't do that
I love you more than just what's in the bank
And that's a fact, and that's a fact
Let it go, when you'll be home
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Love like we used to be
You used to make me happy
Give it up, give me your trust
Give me your passion, give me your love
To make me wanna stay
I wanna go back to the day

I loved you (more)
When you had no money (more)
Used to say I loved you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)
I loved you (more)
Every day was sunny (more)
Used to think about you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)
I loved you (more)
When you had no money (more)
Used to say I loved you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)
I loved you (more)
Every day was sunny (more)
Used to think about you (more)
Baby all I need is (more time and more mind)Embed
