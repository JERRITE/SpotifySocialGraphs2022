Peppermint Lyrics[Intro: Lexy Medgaus, Jack Stauber]
Can I have a peppermint?
You can have a peppermint
That's too hot for me!
Bleh! Hey! Aaah!
I don't like the peppermint!
You don't like the peppermint? (No!)
It's too spi-icy!

[Outro: Lexy Medgaus, Jack Stauber]
Well, why'd you ask me for a mint?
I don't know
When did the spiciness begin?
I don't know
Is it all because of me?
I don't know
Am I sleeping on the couch?
