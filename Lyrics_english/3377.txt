I Heard You Got Too Litt Last Night Lyrics[Chorus]
I heard you got too litt last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple Sprite
Thing's you should've known
I heard you flexin' on 'em yeah
You wanna' mix it up
But fuck it baby, no regrets
And never switch it up

[Verse 1]
Too turnt
Last night you showed me all that ratchet shit that you learned
I showed her how to treat a Lambo like an Uber
Dancin' naked on a table, that's the true her
It was a vibe if you wanna' know
[Chorus]
I heard you got too litt last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple Sprite
Girl you think you grown
I heard you saucin' on 'em, yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it baby, no regrets
And never switch it up

[Verse 2]
Okay
1 pill had her lookin' like Naomi
And 2 pills, had her lookin' like my soulmate
Me and 3 bad bitches, call it foreplay
It's just a vibe if you wanna' know

[Chorus]
I heard you got too litt last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple sprite
Things you should've known
I heard you saucin' on 'em yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it baby, no regrets
And never switch it up

I know
I know tonight you're gettin' higher than your high hopes
Last night was only you and I on your iPhone
So promise you won't tell nobody, baby I won't
It's just a vibe if you wanna' know
Pullin' up like this
Flexin' on my wrist
Last night I did way too litt, I forget
Panties on my dash, pictures with no flash
This life too fast, take me back, take me back, ey

[Chorus]
I heard you got too litt last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple Sprite
Things you should've known
I heard you flexin' on 'em yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it baby, no regrets
And never switch it up10Embed
