Loose my hand lyrics [lyrics by "release my hand"]

[Enter: Noel Schajris]
HMM, Narana, HMM
No, you don't need to understand
Because the heart has never served, the heart does not think
No, my life, why do you try? You don't have to explain me
I will always love your freedom no matter how much that hurts

[Pre-Caro: Noel Schajris & Leonel García]
And yes, I understand what you want to talk about
That sometimes you need to know about me
But I don't even know about you
Live like this, thinking about you
[Choir: Noel Schajris & Leonel García, Leonel García]
Loose my hand now, please
Understand that I have to go
If you don't feel this love anymore
I have nothing else to say
Don't say anything already, please
I understand you, but understand me
Each word increases pain
And a tear wants to leave

[Verse 2: Leonel García]
And please, don't stop me
I always find the way to continue and live, although now I do not have it
And no, my life, it's not worth it, what do you want to call
If what was I will no longer be? This is the last dinner

[Pre-Coro: Noel Schajris & Leonel García, Leonel García]
And yes, I understand what you want to talk about
That sometimes you need to know about me
But I don't even know about you
Live like this, thinking about you

[Chorus: Noel Schajris & Leonel García]
Loose my hand now, please
Understand that I have to go
If you don't feel this love anymore
I have nothing else to say
Don't say anything already, please
I understand you, but understand me
Each word increases pain
And a tear wants to leave

[Chorus: Noel Schajris & Leonel García]
Loose my hand now, please
Understand that I have to go
If you don't feel this love anymore
I have nothing else to say
Don't say anything already, please
I understand you, but understand me
Each word increases pain
And a tear wants to leave

[Outro: Noel Schajris & Leonel García, Leonel García]
