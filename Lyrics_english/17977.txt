Home (Disney Princess Remixed) LyricsYes, I made the choice (Yeah)
For Papa, I will stay (Yeah)
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way
You monster (Oh)

If you think that what you've done is right (You're wrong)
Well then (You're a fool)
Think again

Is this home? (Oh)
Is this where I should learn to be happy? (Learn to be happy)
Never dreamed (Oh)
That a home could be dark and cold (Dark and cold)
I was told
Every day in my childhood
Even as we grow old
"Home will be where the heart is"
Never were words so true
My heart's far (Far), far away (Far away)
Home is too
Is this home? (Oh)
Is this what I must learn to believe in? (Learn to believe in)
Try to find (Oh)
Something good in this tragic place (Tragic place)
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty space
Oh, but that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far (Far), far away (Far away)
Home's a lie

Oh
Oh

Yes, I made the choice (Yeah)
For Papa, I will stay (Stay)
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way (No way)

What I'd give
To return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know
That I can't
Solve my problems going back

Am I here for a day or forever? (Day or forever?)
Shut away (Oh)
From the world until who knows when (Who knows when)
Oh, but then
As my life has been altered once
It can change again
Build higher walls around me (Build them)
Change every lock and key (It's locked)
Nothing lasts (No)
Nothing holds (No)
All of me

My heart's far, far away
