Best Friend’s Ass (Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Alright, let's go

[Verse 1]
Walk in VIP, don't need no drink tickets, buddy
I got money, milk and honey
All my bitches actin' funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, uh, they poppin' bottles like, uh
They on my body like, uh
They got the tab and they call me bad
[Chorus]
But all I see is fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass

[Post-Chorus]

Lights on, gotta leave here now
They're clearin' out the room
I don't care, let's get some food
Fuck that, we're goin' to the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, uh, we poppin', sippin' like, uh
And now we trippin' like fuck
I feel super, call a Uber

[Chorus 2]
But it turns out he's a fuckboy
So I told him step up on the gas
'Cause I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's (Ass)

[Outro]
