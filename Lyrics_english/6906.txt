Stop Lyrics [letter of "stop"]

[Verse 1: mike bahía]
Tell me what are you doing here
When would it not come back?
What is your forgiveness?
Playing that you leave and come back
So you always solve it, as if it didn't hurt

[Choir: Mike Bahía & Danny Ocean]
Stop
If yours is not called love
I ask you please, with all my heart
Don't play with my mind, Yeah, EH-EH
It was enough that you said "Goodbye"
Pa 'never come back, and you always return (woh, oh)
You always come back (ah, ah)
Stop (EH)
If yours is not called love
So, don't try (don't try), oh, oh
It was enough that you said "Goodbye"
Pa 'never return again, and you always return (oh, oh; ba-babylon, girl)
You always come back (oh, oh; ba-babylon, girl)
[Verse 1: Danny Ocean]
Since you left, woman, and plan 'come back
I wanted to ask you if you can bring me a "I love you"
Hey, a "sincere"
Because if not, hold, hold
Hey, look at me well in front
That people find out that you lie to me '(Yeah)
You lie to me ', you don't ere' good people
Nerd
This is not (not)
It is not love (ey)
It is a whim (-Pricho)
With good flavor (Ey)
Understand that, and, understand that I love you, baby, but-

[Choir: Mike Bahía & Danny Ocean, both]
Stop (Stop)
If yours is not called love
So, don't try (don't try), oh, oh
It was enough that you said "Goodbye"
(It was enough, baby)
Pa 'never come back, and you always come back
(You always come back; oh, oh)
You always come back (you always come back)
Ouh, and hold, please (hold, hold)
If yours is not called love (oooh, uoh, don't try)
So, don't try, ey (yeah, h)
Hey, it was enough that you said "Goodbye"
Pa 'never come back (ey), and you always come back
(You always come back)
You always come back (you always come back; ah, ah)

You have me in a sway, Ill (You have me ')
You use me and that's not right
Mommy, it's okay to love you '(no, no, no)
But that is not the way to spend the whole life, really ...

[Outro: Mike Bahia]
