She tells me:
"Daddy, give me until the skin is stood"
Tal Ver 'like to leave him scar' (Cicatrice ')
And with her hand 'herself slips
What did I do?

[Bridge: Tempo & Nicky Jam]
Wants me to give it and never stop
She wants more, and that was about to give her
When he climbs on top he does not want to get off
She wants sex never falling in love, Yeh-eh
Wants me to give it and never stop
She asks for more, and that's to give her
When he climbs on top he does not want to get off (get off)
She wants sex never falling in love
