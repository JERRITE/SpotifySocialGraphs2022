Pope Livin Lyrics[Intro]
[?] shades, I got on [?] shades
(Yeah, oh yeah)
Jkari

[Chorus]
Been rollin' loud before rollin' loud, pope livin
Speakin' on em, watch his soul touch the clouds
That’s just for trippin, been puttin' it on since first day
Never needed attendance, big bow diamonds my cartier lenses
I done iced out my vision, perc talk, xan talk
Can't even fit in my city cause its weird if he wicked
Man fuck the short talk, got me feelin' like Bridget, and the lil midget
Stack the M's, take care of the guys
We really just one of them ones
Smokin' opps I'm gettin too fried, these niggas they over and done
[Verse 1]
These roach ass niggas, these get in jail, drop the soap ass niggas
Ain't bout no business, they ain't standin' on business
Trapped on Cleveland and they trapped in the Bentley
Stick baby shootin', always with a semi
Spent 20K all cash at the dentist
Waffle house baby, never ate it at Dennys
[?] 23 no [?], handle business
Pop my shit, I don't care how they felt
Put on my switch, I don't care for a belt
You on that toast, while ya face gettin' melt
She give me pussy, I pull up with gift
Main spot, you can't get a glimpse
She got hit at the condo and dropped her in 5th
Stop talkin' like you got a bag, nigga stop cappin' too much dip on ya chip
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
Stop the beat, where you goin'
33 shots, Patrick Ewing
In the high speed, lovin' my foreign
I been makin' these bitches, we back at the foreign
Just know this shit ain't borin'
Why you cuffin' that nigga he corn
If he play with this shit then I'm drawin'
And my team.. [?]

[Chorus]
Been rollin' loud before rollin' loud, pope livin
Speakin' on em, watch his soul touch the clouds
That’s just for trippin, been puttin' it on since first day
Never needed attendance, big bow diamonds my cartier lenses
I done iced out my vision, perc talk, xan talk
Can't even fit in my city cause its weird if he wicked
Man fuck the short talk, got me feelin' like Bridget, and the lil midget
Stack the M's, take care of the guys
We really just one of them ones
Smokin' opps I'm gettin too fried, these niggas they over and done

Big middle finger, it's fuck how you feelin' and fuck how you livin'
I don't even go in Lenox, I know if I go ima pop me a nigga
For tryin' my pimpin, I'm pushin' real P don't think I'm slippin'
Rockin' my Travis Scott braids and I'm dripped to the flo'
With a bitch look like Kylie Jenner
Hop out the black truck, you can see the barrel of the stick, it came wit a kit
I gotta stop fuckin' these hoes wit status, lil rich bitch keep havin' a fit
Smellin like static, my hoe red flaggin'
Dick in her back, I call her [?]
Yeah when it's natural just know it's a fatty
Hop in the trunk, get sucked in the caddy
And it's a BP, shoot yo blick
Go wit yo move, make death yo wish
Errbody hatin' like my name was Chris
All of my dawgs, they sip
Get it in while my backend flip
Wood grain that draco rip, came from nothin' I used to be poor
Now my lifestyle, I'm livin galore
Now the bitches show up on the shore

[Chorus]
Been rollin' loud before rollin' loud, pope livin
Speakin' on em, watch his soul touch the clouds
That’s just for trippin, been puttin' it on since first day
Never needed attendance, big bow diamonds my cartier lenses
I done iced out my vision, perc talk, xan talk
Can't even fit in my city cause its weird if he wicked
Man fuck the short talk, got me feelin' like Bridget, and the lil midget
Stack the M's, take care of the guys
We really just one of them ones
Smokin' opps I'm gettin too fried, these niggas they over and done1Embed
