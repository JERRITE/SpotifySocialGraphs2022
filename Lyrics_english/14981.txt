Dead End Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
I drive all alone, at night
I drive all alone
Don't know what I'm headed for

[Verse 2]
I follow the road, blind
Until the road is dead end
Night's in my veins, it's calling me
Racing along these arteries, and
Law is just a myth
To herd us over the cliff
[Verse 3]
I follow the road at night
Just hoping to find
Which puzzle piece fell out of me

[Verse 4]
I know who you are, and I
Open the door and climb in
Hold me real close and do it again
Ache for the touch of my dead end friends

[Verse 5]
And oh, I gotta know
Is it dead at the end of the road?
I can tell by the look in your eyes
We're the same
My dead end friends and I

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 6]
We drive all alone at night
A never ending begin
Sweet as a curse just out of reach
Awakens the dead end part of me
And oh, no more wandering
Just me and my dead end friends again
Yeah
You might also like[Bridge]
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead
