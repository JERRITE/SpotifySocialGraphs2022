How Long Will I Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can
How long will I need you
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

[Chorus]
How long will I be with you
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand
[Verse 2]
How long will I want you
As long as you want me to
And longer by far
How long will I hold you
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

[Chorus]
How long will I give to you
As long as I live through you
However long you say
How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

[Outro]
How long will I love you
As long as stars are above youYou might also like31Embed
