155 Lyrics [lyrics of "155" with Costa Gold]

[Verse 1: NOG]
Nog and Predella is Shady with Jay-Z
HIT DELIVERY FROM MONTH IN MONTH
And I know you test the faith of those that is fake
Because it calls the lady, hmm, baby
I know I've done shit, I've seen myself in this
Like these bro that despises me
That just tests me, I already did this
I spoke badly about MC because I was envy
I was in a hurry, that disperses
The life of the other? I do not care
It's just that others are worse, that stresses me
So if I was quiet, it's because I made the cherish
The gift when it is good is in the cell
I know, every sound with my flow is a pearl
And made every show c'os brother bring bank
The cats want to roll, even the incredulous, Biatch
I saw that I wanted to prevent me from following my faith (I don't doubt it)
Ask me Din-din, share my wife (it's fucked)
To the beak I say: 155
There's a bro out of the navel
We are Uzi's safety in the belt
And if he ramelary (he's fucked with me) Ra, Ra
[Chorus: NOG | NOG & PREDELLA]
In appetite?
I always go
Unlimited?
I always
Is zo a movie?
Horror
La Famiglia
Dam
In appetite?
I always go
Unlimited?
I always
Is zo a movie?
Horror
La Famiglia
Dam

[Verse 2: Predella | NOG]
Ah, gold and fire in the wizard (OH)
Everyone in the game to put my family at the top with gold
All gold
What is the slang of the monster?
The crazy says: "dududuh"
"Tey, Tey, Tey, Tey"
Nog with the note, My Nigga Liga (PRR):
(Speak, Predella, what is the progress of the streets?)
It rains outside, it's six from the morning
It is cold and takes time to spend time
Bag, my plate, I'm another gladiator
Since SÃ£o Paulo is the demo cage
Mount of glass, bodies
Death, with each toast per sip
Measure your step, measure the word
Measure your life and calculate your run
Gagged, my past love
In life it is a nine aiming my forehead
Rap help, because he moves you
Shows you that life is not a bitch at the party
Save, Daleste; Go to the idea
All mine who died for the cherish
Want to bump me? Just pass there
That I'm in the stone spout slab, fucking
