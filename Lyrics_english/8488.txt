I Feel So Bad Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel so bad
That I might have led you wrong
When I met you, I was so in love
I didn't think that I could be strong, but, but
Things started slipping
Thought they'd go back to how they were
Should've been honest sooner
Before things got so much worse

[Pre-Drop]

Ayy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
You made us change
Way back when we were fine
Way back when I, I loved you
You couldn't tame your mind
I, I loved you for who you were
Not for that girl that you thought you could be
Now I can't believe
This is happening to me

[Pre-Drop]
Oh, tryna bring me closer
But you're not pushing me away
Baby, I won't love you any better
If you continue to make us change
Oh, oh, tryna bring me closer
But you're not pushing me away
Baby, I won't love you any better
If you continue to make us change, ayy

Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
