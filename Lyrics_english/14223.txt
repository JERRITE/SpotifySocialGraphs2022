Precious Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pound for pound and cheek to cheek
Cheek paler than the lamp light
Take me down to light the box
We'll play Super Scalextrics

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn to this
Darkness
Into light and then I'll turn too bright
The better for hype
I'll need heart and you'll need courage
We all need-
[Verse 2]
Toe to toe, nowhere to go
So I'm tiptoeing around it
I held you down and I held my own
And now I feel like I'm floating

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn to this
Head on
And then keep on
Keeping on
I'll need heart and you'll need courage
We all need time

[Chorus]
So let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it

[Verse 3]
Don't you know nobody knows
If there's somebody waiting
You'll hold yourself up and you'll hold yourself in
And pray that you're growing
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And you turn to this
Darkness
You turn it into light and then you'll turn too bright
The better for hype
I'll need heart and you'll need courage
We all need time

[Chorus]
So let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
'Cause we'll need heart and we'll need courage
In these times
We'll need heart and we'll need courage
In these times
'Cause time can mean so much
Are you still mine?1Embed
