Falling Into You Lyrics[Verse 1]
And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
[Verse 2]
I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
You must begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

[Bridge]
Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!

[Verse 3]
So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are
You might also like[Outro]
Falling into you
Falling into you
