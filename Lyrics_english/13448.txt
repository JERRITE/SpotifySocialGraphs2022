The Groupie Lyrics [lyrics by "La Groupie" ft. Ñengo Flow & Nicky Jam]

[Chorus: from the ghetto]
I met her on the album, she sticks like a grupie
She is very fashion with her friend 'who are pouppies
She told me that if I put 2c
And I replied that no, but like Pussy
He got hysterical, began to move the booty
Dj above, do the music sits
Does not put him to regular, what she smokes is Kushy
WA, WA, WA, Wassie sounds hard like Uzi
WA, WA, WA, Wassie sounds hard like Uzi
[Verse 1: ñejo]
I'm with some girls that are very fashion
T-Átan Guilla 'by Kim Kardashian
S-S-S-They spend asking that when I introduce them to the dalmation
P-p-p-by the WhatsApp, that 'sends him and that the location
This is going to sound for the coyote, with the traffic light and Alex Sensation
Here there is no esplanation, but this song is going to be a stick
And n-and we don't have to border
That we are millo 'or that somo' bad '
S-S-S-Like Fucking, P-P-P-PA 'that gives him follow
And in the Instagram profile has a photo that says
"She loves to swallow"

[Verse 2: Luigi 21 plus]
You smell 2c (Ah, yes?), I put the whiskey (Yes)
I'm with Ñengo Flow, Ñejo and Geezy (you know ')
Give me that pussy pa 'put it well juicy (Dame)
Give you pa'l of nalgadas and leave it 'Bruise (oh, shit)
She wants sex (what?), Me Bellaquera (how?)
Give yourself as a pear, like anyone (pa, pa, pa)
Pull your hair, sweep the ground (come here)
Use you as a broom, howl like wolf
Uh, suck it, I so much so much
Uh, and the milk steals it (how?)
She becomes the most silly (ah, yes?)
Malparida, Piroba (Pyrish)

I get more satyr and I play it fast
That bun is more wet than an aquatic park
I get it fast and get it quickly
I take the magical dust that panicked her
I get more satyr and I play it fast
That bun is more wet than an aquatic park
I get it fast and get it quickly
I take the magical dust that panicked her

[Chorus: from the ghetto]
I met her on the album, she sticks like a grupie
She is very fashion with her friend 'who are pouppies

And I replied that no, but like Pussy
He got hysterical, began to move the booty
Dj above, do the music sits
Does not put him to regular, what she smokes is Kushy
Uh-ah pa, pa, pa, pa, if it sounds hard like Uzi
Uh-ah pa, pa, pa, pa, if it sounds hard like Uzi

Daddy, sudden me, sudden me, I don't hear me, I don't hear myself
Go up, go up, go up

[Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
Mommy, mine is automatic, your maniac arrived
You say you are my fan, but I am the fanatic
You do get crazy, but I'm already lunatic
To give you in the hard bed, I am fantastic in that
How I don't know you, I have to put on plastic
Your eye 'are asking me to put you with the whip
Great ass and that makes me nice
There is much 'that throw you, but that' guys are basic '
Tonight you are my cat, and I am your kitten
Vamo 'to put it down, I have an elastic tongue
Discus me if tonight I put on a little satyr
What happens is that I want to put it quickly
(Goes up!)
[Bridge 2]
Take it, hold it, uh
If you want, ma ', ask for it, uh
Cage ma ', hold it, uh
If you like it, ma ', take it

[Verse 4: Ñengo Flow]
Pharaoh of Nefertiti, I love them without cellulite
Good press, vo 'to make that booty burst
And he smokes from the kill that neurons kills me
There comes Ñengo, enchumbing Toa 'Las Gatas
Night Wrist (I '), Baby, Here I Come
Activa'o with the chicharra in case a mouth comes out, to burst it
Oh, Ye-eh, Ñengo in Medellín Camellando
Pure breast without clothes guaying me
For you punish you, calling it
Pa 'your arrecheras I'm always lending myself
No one leaves this room
Until solving the beautiful
Until the beautiful, nobody leaves this room

[Pre-car: from the ghetto]
I get more satyr and I play it fast
That bun is more wet than an aquatic park
I get it fast, and I get it quickly
I take the magical dust that panicked her
I get more satyr, and I play it fast
That bun is more wet than an aquatic park
I get it fast, and I get it quickly
I take the magical dust that panicked her

[Chorus: from the ghetto]
I met her on the album, she sticks like a grupie
Paste like Groupie, Paste-Pega like Puppie
She told me that if I put 2c
Met the 2C, I put at 2c
He got hysterical, began to move the booty
He started moving the booty, began-began to move the booty
Does not put him to regular, what she smokes is Kushy
Uh-ah pa, pa, pa, pa, if it sounds hard like Uzi
Uh-ah pa, pa, pa, pa, if it sounds hard like Uzi
