Reach inside and hold you close
I won't leave you on your own
Teach me the words I used to know
Yeah, I forgot 'em long ago
So hold the girl
Hold the girl
Hold the girl
Hold the girl

[Refrain]
Hold that girl
Hold that girl
Hold that girl
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get down with guilt
For the promises I've broken to my younger self
Moving on, maybe I never will
'Cause I left you spinning on the carousel

[Pre-Chorus]
Been living without you
Been living without you

[Chorus]
Reach inside and hold you close
I won't leave you on your own
Teach me the words I used to know
Yeah, I forgot them long ago
I wanna rеmember
She is mе and I am her
So hold the girl
Hold the girl

[Refrain]
(You gotta) Hold that girl
(You gotta) Hold that girl (Ooh)
(You gotta) Hold that girl
(You gotta)

Sometimes I just wanna run away
Leave behind that old me, start again
Then I'll remember who I'm really made of
And she's been hide-and-seeking, waiting all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Been living without you
Been living without you (Oh)

[Chorus]
Reach inside and hold you close
I won't leave you on your own
Teach me the words I used to know
Yeah, I forgot them long ago
I wanna remember
She is me and I am her
So hold the girl
Hold the girl

[Bridge]
Close to your heart
Never ever let her go (Never let you go)
They'll tell you to sit up, and shut up, and grow up
What the hell do they know?
'Cause the girl in your soul's singing on
And you owe her the world
So hold the girl
Hold the girl
[Chorus]
Reach inside and hold you close
I won't leave you on your own
Teach me the words I used to know
Yeah, I forgot about them so long ago

[Outro]
Reach inside and hold you close
I won't leave you on your own
Teach me the words I used to know
Yeah, I forgot them long ago
I wanna remember
She is me and I am her
So hold the girl
