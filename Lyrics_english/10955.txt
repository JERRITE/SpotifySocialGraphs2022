Only Love Can Hurt Like This (Reissue) Lyrics[Intro: Paloma Faith]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Paloma Faith]
I tell myself you don't mean a thing
And what we got, got no hold on me
But when you’re not there, I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die till I feel your touch
[Chorus: Paloma Faith & Both]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

[Verse 2: Teddy Swims & Paloma Faith]
I say I wouldn’t care if you walked away
But every time you're there, I'm begging you to stay
And when you come close (When you come close), I just tremble
And evеry time, every timе you go
Oh, it's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

[Chorus: Teddy Swims & Both]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this

[Bridge: Both, Paloma Faith & Teddy Swims]
But it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture, makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You might also like[Chorus: Paloma Faith, Both & Teddy Swims]
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this (Only love can hurt like this)
Only love can hurt like this (Only love can hurt like this)
Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt like this, ooh
And it must’ve been a deadly kissEmbed
