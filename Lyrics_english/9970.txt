Co Star Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, oh, baby
Said I'm glad that I'm here, that I'm here tonight
So glad I'm here
Won't you let me your co-star?
Ooh, said I'll do what I gotta do tonight, oh
Just wanna be a part of your show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Robert]
Now it's late
I can't even pretend I've been sleeping
What a date at my place
Both of our bodies fiending
So I'll wait
Girl, your shape makes me wanna concentrate
Do whatever you want to me (Do whatever, oh)
Whatever you want to me, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Que & Mike]
What do you have in store for me, girl?
(What do you have in store for me, girl?)
It's looking like one of those nights where we don't get no sleep, no
What do have in store for me, girl?
(What do you have in store for me, girl?)
Baby, I'm anxious, I'm tryna focus
Will I be able to take this?

[Chorus]
We both know what will go down on tonight (We both know what, go down tonight)
You've been teasing until the time was right (Until the time was right)
So let go, it's your show, all I wanna do is co-star (Yeah, yeah)
(See all I wanna do is co-star)
I'm in the right place at the right time
(I'm in the right place at the right time)
I'm in the right place at the right time

It's your world, you can have whatever you want, believe me
How did we finally end up in ecstasy?
So I'll wait, girl, your shape makes me wanna concentrate
Do whatever you want to me
Whatever you want to me, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Que & Brian]
What do you have in store for me, girl?
(What do you have in store for me, girl?)
It's looking like one of those nights where we don't get no sleep, no
What do have in store for me, girl?
(What do you have in store for me, girl?)
Baby, I'm anxious, I'm tryna focus
I don't think that I can take this

[Chorus]
We both know what will go down on tonight (We know what's goin' down, yes we do)
You've been teasing until the time was right (You've been teasing)
So let go, it's your show, all I wanna do is co-star
(All I wanna do is lay right next to the star)
I'm in the right place at the right time
(Oh, I just wanna be everywhere you are)
I'm in the right place at the right time
(Oh, your body's looking to me and it's saying that I am)
I'm in the right place at the right time
(You don't have to worry no more, you're in my hands)
I'm in the right place at the right time
