[Intro: Daddy Yankee, Anuel Aa & Ozuna]
The murderers
WO-OH-OH, BRR
Real until death, baby
This is the remix!
Uah

[Pre-stribe: Ozuna & Darell]
My mind and 'malda' (yes-yes)
I drink pa 'remind you
And you who call me
Pa 'what happens to look for you
I want to give you (that's it, that's, like that)
Like the last time I did it ', mommy
I want to give you (The Real Rondón)
I want to give you, baby, I want to give you, baby, huh
(Brytiago)
[Chorus: Brytiago & Darell]
I don't vo 'to deny you that hard you see you' (that is like that)
It may be that drunk one day returns and give you (so you know ')
I hope and end 'as the last sees' (by law)
That is the one who fell in love with you and not to see me '

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
(The Big Boss, fire)
Killer, I know that you are bad
Therefore, antibala vest suit '
You chambaste in the assault and you ended up in my room
Because in the end, with me, it slips to you '
You make the crazy, crazy, intelligent
How knows me ', play with my mind
To 'the world is crazy until another front has
Birth, a insane
Give him, Ponte Suci, put the buttock 'on the ground
Vamo 'pa' a burial, but don't veil you
I am like the lamb, I zumbo the poison
Mommy, I apologize to you and I apply the brake
Sicaria, you do not go 'will change
You like danger, and so you will stay

[Verse 2: Darell]
(It's The Real Rondón, Ra-Ta-Ta)
You are a serious problem (Já!)
Because you have no heart, he is already dead in the cemetery (that is like that)
Do not listen to intermediates
That get out of the middle
Without condom with you, I'm going to the criteria
When we are together ', mommy, everything is beautiful
You know I don't snack much, but I have more than them (Ja-Ja!)
You, you, that the phillie seal it
When the note goes up, put on four in what I crash
(Real G4 Life, My Nigga)
That guy has hated you (he hated)
You say you are confused '(confused')
Fight you 'at night and fight you' in day
But you ere 'masoquista because it is still' there (there I got)
I will give you hard for growing '(for growing')
I will pull your hair for Lucia '(for Lucia')
Pégate pa 'give you a barría'
And when I get the other day I will say na 'I lost'

And in the neck now I have one hundred thousand (one hundred thousand)
Baby, I bot and I forgot (uah)

And I swear for my life, I don't break you again, eh-eh

[Verse 4: Brytiago]
(Brytiago)
Malicious, you always have what you want
It only looks for me 'every time it suits you
It gets difficult, your pride is not who stops it
As much as Brinque and Salte ', Baby, here you die'
And now you are well loose
Two drinks and I turn back
To make a pact the devil tempts me
Playing with my mind you are an expert
Among that 'legs you have' powers
That's why I'm still here even if you fight
Tell you no, naked cannot be
I will not deny that the key has it '
But fighting, you are fifty and zero to Mayweather

[Verse 5: ozuna]
I hope you repeat
I want one, a probaite '
Remember ', baby
As in La Guagua my song 'you the caves
Like Kryptonite
And that bootysote that merits
(Ma'-ma ') I can't forget your way' and kiss
How I ate and he calling you to fight
Now, if you want, we see us' in jet to ensure
Calm, that he dies as he says that he will touch you
I know baby
Let us remember how it did it '
But don't forget 'how we ate', baby

[Chorus: Brytiago, Anuel Aa & Darell]
I don't vo 'to deny you that hard you see you', eh-eh
I know that neither drunk I get another one '(pa' what knows')
I hope let's end 'like last time'
And I swear for my life, I don't break you again, eh-eh
