No Fear No More (Remix) Lyrics[Intro - Madeon & EARTHGANG]
I know we're not listened to, but
(Woo!)
(Hey!)

[Verse 1 - Madeon]
You used to tell me not to dream away
Go chase the safety, not the rush (Woo!)
You say this future is a world away (Woo!)
I think you worry way too much
[Verse 2 - WowGr8]
(Woo!)
Level up
Light glows from my soul and my skeleton
Better work better play, found some better love
Gotta dive head first, can't be scared of love
You shine, you a diamond when pressure come
We ain’t sweatin now we the one proposing the toast all in the restaurant
When you make it this far is it ever done?
Good news, the best is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus - Olu]
Big dreams and bright lights
Long days and fast nights
Chasing what I like
Here's to the good life
Baby have no fear
Now the moment's here
Let's enjoy this crazy ride

[Chorus - Madeon & EARTHGANG]
Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore (Beyond the shore)
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more
No fear no more
You might also like[Drop - Olu]
Take it to the top
We'll take it to the top
We'll take it to the top
This one's for me and you

[Bridge - Olu]
I rise, you rise, we rise together (I rise)
I fly, you fly, we fly forever (I fly)
It's time we'll win like we knew we would (We would)
And this one's for me and you (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

[Chorus - Madeon, EARTHGANG & West Los Angeles Children’s Choir]
Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore (Beyond the shore)
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more
No fear no more (Ride)

[Outro - Madeon]
Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more3Embed
