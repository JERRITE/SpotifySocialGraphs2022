What are you going to give me to choose once again
I would choose you without thinking
Is that there is nothing to think
There is neither reason, no reason
To doubt it or a second

Because you have been the best
That touched this heart
And that between heaven and you
I stay with you
If I have given you everything I have
Until it is indebted to myself
And still ask if I love you
What are you going?

If there is no minute of my time
That you don't go through thought
And still ask if I love you

If this is not wanting to tell me what it will be
If I need your kisses to breathe
And of your eyes that are giving life
And that leave me without exit

And what do I want to leave?
If I have never been so happy
I prefer more than anything in this world

If I have given you everything I have
Until it is indebted to myself
And still ask if I love you
What are you going?

If there is no minute of my time
(If there is no minute of my time)
That you don't go through thought
And still ask if I love you
You Might Also Likehh! And you don't see
That all my life only depends on you?
Yeh-he

If I have given you everything I have
(I have given you everything I have)
Until it is indebted to myself
And still ask if I love you
What are you going?

If there is no minute of my time
(If there is no minute of my time)
That you don't go through thought
And still ask if I love you
What are you going?

What are you going?

What are you going? Embed
