End Of The End Lyrics[Verse 1]
All around, I see dusk, I see dark, I see ashes
Silence as the dust settles on the horizon
Feel the embers stir
Can you hear them calling?

[Drop]

[Chorus]
This is the end of the end of the world
We'll begin rising, come find me
This is the end of the end of the world
Can’t stop the revolution that's coming
[Drop]
Can't stop the revolution that’s coming

[Verse 2]
All around, I see death and defeat and destruction
The sound of my heart beating loud, an eruption
But I feel so alive
Can't stop the revolution that's coming

[Drop]

[Chorus]
This is the end
This is the end of the end of the world

[Drop]
This is the end
This is the end of the end of the—

[Chorus]
This is the end of the end of the world
We'll begin rising, come find me
This is the end of the end of the world (The end)
Can't stop the revolution that's coming

[Drop]
This is the end
This is the end of the end

(You can't stop it, can't stop it now, now)
(We’ll begin rising)
(This is the end of the end)
Of the worldEmbed
