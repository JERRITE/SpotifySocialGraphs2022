Cooler Than Me (Single Mix) Lyrics[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?
[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You, you, you got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Bridge]
'Cause it sure seems (It sure seems) you got no doubts (No doubts)
But we all see (We all see) you got your head in the clouds

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than meYou might also like1Embed
