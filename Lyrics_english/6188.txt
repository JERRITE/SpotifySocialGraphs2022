Nunchuk Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve got violence in my head
And all my friends are dead
I’ve got white noise in my brain
And it’s always been the same

I don’t need no deadmen bullets in my chest
Me, myself and I, we don’t need nobody else
No I don’t cos I’m good on my own
I don’t need no deadmen messing with my head
[Pre-Chorus]
Flying high when I’m solo
Running wild going loco
Better hide in a psycho
I’m a psycho

[Chorus]
I don’t need nobody else
I’m doing fine all by myself
It’s just me, myself and I
It’s just me, myself and I
I don’t need no place to go
I’m doing fine here on my own
It’s just me myself and I
It’s just me myself and I

[Verse 2]
I need silence for my health
Cos I’m always sick to death
I got madness in my eyes
When the chaos starts to rise

I just put my foot down driving for the edge
Me, myself and I we don’t even catch a breath
No I don’t, cos I’m good on my own
I don’t need no deadmen messing with my head
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Flying high when I’m solo
Running wild going loco
Better hide in a psycho
I’m a psycho

[Chorus]
I don’t need nobody else
I’m doing fine all by myself
It’s just me, myself and I
It’s just me, myself and I
I don’t need no place to go
I’m doing fine here on my own
It’s just me myself and I
It’s just me myself and I
Nunchuk

[Bridge]
Flying high when I’m solo
Running wild going loco
Better hide in a psycho
I’m a psycho

[Chorus]
I don’t need nobody else
I’m doing fine all by myself
It’s just me, myself and I
It’s just me, myself and I
I don’t need no place to go
I’m doing fine here on my own
It’s just me myself and I
It’s just me myself and IEmbed
