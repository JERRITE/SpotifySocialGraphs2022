Melrose Meltdown Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep horrible blues
Watching you work the room
There's a frequency of trouble
In the car to Malibu
I'll be crying on your milk-white sheets
Hoping one day we're married
In a house you'll build around me

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I believe
I believe in old-fashioned things
Imagining us
But the longer I stay, I can see you
What's happening? What's happening?
[Chorus]
Welcome to my Melrose meltdown
Nobody ever breaks up, we just break down
We really fucked it up in diamonds and drugstores
That's what we came for
And when you get it, you got what you need

[Verse 2]
Handing out gold stars for tailor-made behaviour
I can see your demons shining like prizes
I'm sat out on the balcony
Too sad to go to the party
It's a crime loving you so, it's a crime letting you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I believe
I believe in old-fashioned things
Imagining us
But the longer I stay, I can see you
What's happening? What's happening?

[Chorus]
Welcome to my Melrose meltdown
Nobody ever breaks up, we just break down
We really fucked it up in diamonds and drugstores
That's what we came for
And when you get it, you got what you need
You might also like[Bridge]
Got what you need
When you hang up and say, "I'll see you later"
Got what you need
Write it down, California paper
Got what you need
Forevermore, my anti-hero
For loving and letting me go down, down

[Chorus]
Welcome to my Melrose meltdown
Nobody ever breaks up, we just break down
We really fucked it up in diamonds and drugstores
That's what we came for
And when you get it, you got what you need

[Outro]
Welcome to my Melrose meltdown
We just break down
(And when you get it, you got what you need)Embed
