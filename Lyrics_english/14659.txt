How Could an Angel Break My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out, thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

[Chorus]
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
[Verse 2]
I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps, he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

[Chorus]
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
Oh, heart
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, my soul is
Dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me

[Chorus]
How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?
