All Washed Up LyricsI come back to you with dirt in mouth
I can't spit it out out
And I can hold it together on the highway
But I can't do it here
So don't tell the whiskey tank in me
That the war is over
Before it runs over everything
Don't tell me to clean up
Don't tell me to clean up
I am the cup you can never fill up
Oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord
She was a cocktail waitress in Japan
She got old and they sent her home
To the unemployment line
She sings the same song every night
Its okay to be all washed up
Its okay to be all washed up
You can still fall on the dance floor
And pick fights with the rest of the fallen stars
No one likes the old man in me
He cleans hotel rooms
And he coughs profanities
He says I'm in the wrong body
So they locked him up
Like they lock up piano strings
In a hospital they don't want people going around
Hanging things
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
He's like the clear cut keep it away from us
And he's all washed upYou might also likeEmbed
