Pretty Pictures Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pretty pictures on a screen, when I'm with you it’s like a dream
I promise you I'll always grow with you
And if my promise ever slips just trust I'll have the heart to quit
I know when I am better off a friend
It’s not what we wanted, but it's just what we get

[Chorus]
Breaking up and getting back together
Breaking up with someone you love
'Cause you know it's gonna be for the better
But it's so hard to give it up
[Verse 2]
I just can't lie to myself, when I'm with you I'm somewhere else
It doеsn’t feel like things will get bettеr
And you’re the best one that I know, I'm stupid if I let you go
But you deserve to get what you’ve been giving
It's not what I wanted, but it's what's true to me

[Chorus]
Breaking up and getting back together
Breaking up with someone you love
’Cause you know it's gonna be for the better
But it's so hard to give it up
Breaking up and getting back together
Breaking up with someone you love
'Cause you know it's gonna be for the better
But it's so hard to give it up

[Outro]
But it's so hard to give it upYou might also likeEmbed
