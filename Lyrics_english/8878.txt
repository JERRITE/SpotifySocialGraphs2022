X. I’ll Be Sure... (MCMXCI) Lyrics*The Kid narrating: And as we walk away from the prison, you asked me a question. One if I'm being honest with myself, I don't know how to really answer after everything that's happened to me. I'm kind of confused because -- I thought you didn't feel that way about me. So you asked me if I felt the way I said I felt about you, during "The Chaser". As far as I'm concerned, this is my answer.*
The Kid: What is it you're asking of me? I mean... but that's kind of a long story
(Hook)

I'll tell you how I feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday
So tell me how you feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

(Verse I.)

You said you wanted the real me
No auto-tune, no rap voice
So you know that it's still me
I wonder if you do feel me
I get so insecure sometimes
And it's mentally killing me
I love the way that you walk
The way that you talk
That fancy perfume your father bought you
It's so wavy
Is it Louie, Mile Davis, Johnny Coltraine?
Sometimes I get Bony James reaction
I can't explain it
You might also likeI like the way you play with words
Like gum, I'm wrapped 'round your finger
I don't have to eat a track to say I'd eat you for dinner
I said one day you'd be my lady
You would get SlimKidShady
In fifth grade, you would just play me
Just like a fool, it's a pity
I think it's true when 3LW said that Playas Gon' Play
I think you know this too
I see we're both Naugh-Tori by Nature
Naturi, I'm soory
Grant me a pass for my potty humor
Lowest hanging fruit of the loom
Girl, I do this for you

But I mean...

(Hook)

I'll tell you how I feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way
And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

So tell me how you feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

(I can tell you how I feel...)
And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

(Verse II.)

Soul sister, you're my sole interest
My train of thought's to take your heart
Like The Grinch had stole Christmas
Jim Carrey version, not Benedict
Like "No shit, Sherlock Holmes!"
I think you're finally getting this
I think 'cause you're an old soul like me
You know what I mean?
Got Boomerang shows on DVD
I acknowledge I'm not your stereo-type
Like Donald Glover
Don't wanna be the part-time lover
Girl, I'm not Stevie Wonder

But I mean...

(Hook)

I'll tell you how I feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

So tell me how you feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

(I can tell you how I feel...)
And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

(Verse III.)
But I can tell by your face, we're Lost Boys "René"
No Haitian, Robbie Kaye, D.O.A
But honestly, babe
I don't know what you want me to say
An honest mistake, I cannot take it back and replay it
And then make that change
I'm not the Master of Time and Space
But I space my bars right on time
So let these haters keep hating
I hunger for you now
That's no Sylar or Eric Bennett
Though I'm no Superman
A scrub I am, I'm no Lazlo Bane

But I mean...

(Hook- 4x)

I'll tell you how I feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

So tell me how you feel night and day
And when you do spread your wings
Girl, I hope you would fly my way

(I can tell you how I feel...)
And I'll be sure to mean what I say
Just be sure to meet me in the middle
That's everyday

Ending:

I'll be sure to mean what I say
And I'll be sure to meet you in the middle
That's everyday...
(Spoken)

Do I love you?
Do I lust you?
Do you consider me a sinner for doing the two?
Would it make any difference to you if you knew?
That all the blood I shed with this pen is for you?
I don't know, maybe I'm just another Negus...
