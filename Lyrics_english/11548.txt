Number One Fan Lyrics[Verse 1]
So I heard the bad news
Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone
In my bedroom
Looking at strangers on my telephone
Well, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you like if I believed those words?
If I'm born to lose
I'll never try and I will never learn, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now," and I turn around like
[Chorus]
"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

[Verse 2]
So here's the bad news
I'm coming for everyone and I'm coming on strong
New hair and new shoes
Yeah, I get what I like because I do what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"I won't leave you now," and I turn around like

[Chorus]
"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

Number one, number one
Number one, number one

[Bridge]
In the thick of it
Will you stick up for me?
In the thick of it
Are you gonna believe that I can do it?
Love me in the way that only you can
Be my number one, number one

[Chorus]
"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan
Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

[Post-Chorus]
Number one, number one
Number one, number one9Embed
