TranslationsEspañolEnglishKnow Me Too Well Lyrics[Intro: Reece Bibby]
Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Chorus: Reece Bibby]
I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (Good but you can tell)

[Verse 1: Blake Richardson]
You're right, I shoulda texted you goodnight
I shoulda given more time
I wish I hadn't known this before
Now I'm replayin' our goodbye
But it wasn't a goodbye
And I still hear you slammin' the door
[Pre-Chorus: George Smith & Reece Bibby]
Try to hit you up, but you've had enough
You're screamin' down the phone, ''You don't know what you lost'' (You don't know what you lost)
I said, "I'm fine," I didn't care that much
But I realise when you hang up, I messed this up

[Chorus: Reece Bibby]
I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (Uh)
'Cause you know me too, you know me too well

[Post-Chorus: Blake & Reece]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know me too well
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2: Danna Paola]
Lo puedo dejar para mí, jamás volverte a llamar
But, baby, no puedo engañarme a mí misma, no
Porque cada vez que me oyes, yo sé que tú me lees
Lo mejor será dejarte ir, y olvidarte

[Pre-Chorus: Danna Paola & Reece Bibby]
Try to hit you up, but he had enough
Just screaming down the phone, ''You don't know what you lost''
I say, "I'm fine," I didn't care that much
But I realise when you hang up, I messed this up

Baby, if I could, then I would (I would)
I would give you all I have
Baby, if I could, then I would
