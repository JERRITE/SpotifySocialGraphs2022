Better alone lyricsme I realized that I am better alone (alone)
This heart does not fall in love
Blessed is the time you left
To not return, you believed that I (mamacita)
I would fall again, but (zidiri)

You don't hurt me anymore, OH-OH-OH
Don't tell me a stranger to you (Kim loaiza)
You are in yesterday
And the tbt to you no longer has
And if I kissed you, it went to drown the sorrows
You say that I leave, and I am еxtraño
You say nothing happens and it hasn't been a year
You broke the promek and feel strange
What do you say you don't love me and I didn't hurt you

After me you will never find better
I hope you hurt you a thousand amoe '
That they always drop you after you fall in love
But if you need, take for you to fall in love with you '

The night is to drowned the penalties
I already left your condemnation
Don't come back, I don't want to, baby
You tell me to go, but you are going to miss me

The night is to drowned the penalties
I already left your condemnation
Don't come back, I don't want to, baby
You tell me to go, but you are going to miss me

You don't hurt me anymore, OH-OH-OH
Don't tell me a strange
You are in yesterday
And the tbt to you no longer has (Zion, Baby)
And if I kissed you, it went to drown the sorrows
You Might Also Likeyo I didn't hurt you, OH-OH-OH
Not everything was bad
Remember yesterday
When my hands walked through your legs
And the promises you made to me, where are they?
Where are they?
Where were the kisses that you gave me yesterday?
You promised me that you were never going to disappear
After all the event
I fell into your story
Because I liked your kisses
But not anymore. it's over

And although the years go by
I miss you
I didn't hurt you
I don't know that you have me

And although the years go by
I miss you
I didn't hurt you
I don't know that you have me

You don't hurt me anymore, OH-OH-OH
Don't tell me a strange
You are in yesterday
And the tbt to you no longer has (Zion, Baby)
And if I kissed you, it went to drown the sorrows
Go and don't come back
Zididi
KL, baby
Zion, Baby
