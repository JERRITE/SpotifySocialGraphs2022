Extra Sturdy Lyrics[Intro]
I structured up, see what's in my cup (Grrah, grrah, boom, grrah, grrah)
I structured up, please don't make me up (Get money, bitch)
I structured up, see what's in my cup (Bizzy)
I structured up, please don't make me up (A Lau on the beat, what, look)

[Verse]
Who really got structure? None of these niggas
They look up to me, I be sonnin' these niggas
I been outside, I don't run from these niggas
I used to throw the hands, but now I got a gun for these niggas (What?)
I swear y'all niggas talk too much
He mentionin' me? Oh, he must be tough
You ain't gon' shoot it, so why you wanna bluff?
These niggas pussy, they movin' so huff (Grrah, grrah, boom, grrah, grrah)
Thеy know I'm extra sturdy
Your bitch on my dick, say she tryna fuck off a yerky
Singin' my songs likе, ooh, "Leva just got him a 30"
I'm on the block, whole lot of knockings if I'm in the spot
Couple of shooters schemin' for a opp
Ain't tuckin' my chain, no, just how I rock
The first nigga reach, the first nigga drop
These niggas know, I call up Ocho when it's time to blow
Fuck you think, he around for show?
Fuck you think, like he ain't gon' go?
I love gettin' money, split it with the bros
Life too short to beef over hoes
Big body V when I'm on the roads
The way you buy sneakers the way I buy poles, like
Nigga dissin' me? He must be playin'
I don't bump niggas, tell boy keep bangin'
Before Suburbans, we was spinnin' the Lincoln
He ain't tough, nigga, we used to spank him
Pack him up, I just got a new bitch so I'm actin' up
Nigga, I ain't tryna beef, I been stackin' up
And I'm big EBK, niggas know what’s up, like
Who really got structure?
That nigga broke, he a buster, still call up JJ to brush him
Endin' they functions, y'all throwin' parties for nothing
Brodie gon' touch at ya muffin, like (Like)
Look, don't fall in love with that bitch that you fuckin', like
Look (Niggas be dyin' for the pussy)
My body different, still call up Swerva to lift 'em (Skrrt)
I would do it, but I switched my position
Black hoodies when I go on a mission, go on a mission
'Cause we makin' movies
If I'm Pippen, Bando two-three, uh
Callin' like "ooh-wee", if we spinnin', it's in two V's, uh (Like)
[Outro]
Uh, uh, who really got structure?
Brodie gon' brush em, like— uh
And I still call up JJ Bands, like— uh, uh
My niggas never ran, like—You might also likeEmbed
