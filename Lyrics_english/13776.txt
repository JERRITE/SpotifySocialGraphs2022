Out of place Lyrics ["out of place" letter "]

[Verse 1]
What a rare night, I know you can see it
The city feels like a storm about to fall
From Sonora to Colima, feeling Ulises Lima
I arrived in the worst possible state and I could not see you

[Chorus]
But you, nightmare of lonely crazy people like me
I want to make you breathe
And me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just want to see you return
[Verse 2]
I was very dumb, when I met you
I wanted to eat the world and that included you
I was wild but I stayed on the trip
I want you to know everything, everything I can't say

[Chorus]
But you, nightmare of lonely crazy people like me
I want to make you breathe
And me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just want to see you return

[Chorus]
But you, nightmare of lonely crazy people like me
I want to make you breathe
And me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just want to see you return

[Outro]
You, nightmare of lonely crazy people like me
I want to make you breathe
And me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just want to see you return
I just want to see you returnyou might Also likembed
