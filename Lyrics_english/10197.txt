[Intro]
Mmm, mm
Your own among strangers
I am a stranger among my
A-A-A-AVEPACK

[Verse]
Envy is eating you, where he eats, there and shit there, ah
I don't need a proof at all, because I look carefully, yes
Enough, enough (enough), there is enough ugliness (ugliness)
There is enough palettes (palette), here this approach does not roll (I-I)
Do not look for help among us, no, do not look for participation
Powers are always mobile, tell your friends
Let them help with the head, tell your friends
If there is someone else, because everything is traitors around
Look, look, look for, know, you can’t know, you have to find
I left the radar of the nobility, sit in Pulkovo dust
I look in the face of them all - they are smiling, dear
This is a facade, a baby, alas, you can’t find your own here, no
[Chorus]
You fell under smoke - died young
This is Friendly Fire-Fire on its own (a-a-a-a-AVEPACK)
This is Friendly Fire - Fire by its
I have a full Visvim set and carbine
You fell under smoke and died young
This is Friendly Fire - Fire by its own (ah)

[Autro]
This is a fire in its own
This, again, fire on its own (ah)
This is a fire in its own
After all I am in the room alone
(I am alone)
This is a fire in its own (again one)
I put Had, this is Aim (again one)
(Again one, again one)
This is a fire in its own (again one)
This is a fire in its own
This is a fire on your own Might Also Like57Embed
