Hannah Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I sent you the sun from my hometown
And Chicago, and Atlanta
Sinking at the sight of your shadow
On the sidewalk in Spain

[Verse 2]
Or back in upstate, was it Jersey?
At the airport to Alaska
Sinking on a call from your hometown
Where they found him tearing through
[Verse 3]
Flying through the blue on your old drive
Got some old files, gotta find 'em
Gotta get 'em out, gotta get out
Gotta get good, gotta give

[Verse 4]
Sinking in again, it's forever now
Glad you held her, glad you held him
Glad you held me too, though I didn't know how to
Be closer to you

[Verse 5]
Shadowed by the blue, am I shining?
I am trying to shine
Shine

[Outro]
Hannah, do no harm

Hannah, do no harm, no harm
Hannah, do no harm
No harm, no harm
