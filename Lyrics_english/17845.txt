BIG MAD Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, yeah, look

[Chorus]
Oh you big mad? Oh you big mad
Got a big bag, poppin' big tags
All white Rover, yeah, I whip that
Ate it up, left no crumbs ’cause that shit smacked
I just sit back, let the chips stack
People juiced out of bars, yeah, they shit cracked
Up the coast, I'ma holler when I get back
Got hits stacked, oh you big mad
[Verse 1]
Ayy, you big mad huh? (Big mad)
I'ma act a fool with the bag huh
Ay, got two, you don’t have none
Ay, thick thighs, I'm a bad one
Gucci loafer, same as the sheet pattern
Woke up, paparazzi keep flashin'
Where'd you get the new drip, they keep askin'
Take a flick, post a pic, don't need captions

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine if I listened what a hater gotta say (Uh-huh)
I nevеr give a broke bitch any time of day (No way)
You ugly whеn you jealous, bitch, look at that face
I'm hot right now, and you not, mm-kay?

[Chorus]
Oh you big mad? Oh you big mad
Got a big bag, poppin' big tags
All white Rover, yeah, I whip that
Ate it up, left no crumbs ’cause that shit smacked
I just sit back, let the chips stack
People juiced out of bars, yeah they shit cracked
Up the coast, I’ma holler when I get back
Got hits stacked, oh you big mad
You might also like[Verse 2]
Ayy, oh you still big mad huh? (Big mad)
Bitch I'm in the coupe, livin’ fast huh (Yeah)
Ay, cop a few, you ain't had none
Ay, don't start, I'm the last one
I do shit they can’t believe happened
Backwoods and red bottoms, high fashion
Camelback and Bali, that's no cappin'
Blue C's, a new yacht, I play captain

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine if I listened what a hater gotta say (I don't)
I never give a broke bitch any time of day
You ugly when you jealous, bitch look at that face
I'm hot right now, and you not, mm-kay?

[Chorus]
Oh you big mad? Oh you big mad
Got a big bag, poppin' big tags
All white Rover, yeah, I whip that
Ate it up, left no crumbs 'cause that shit smacked
I just sit back, let the chips stack
People juiced out of bars, yeah they shit cracked
Up the coast, I'ma holler when I get back
Got hits stacked, oh you big mad
[Outro]
Ah, ah, you big mad huh
I'ma act a fool with the bag huh
Yuh, you big mad huh?
Uh, you big mad, sheeshEmbed
