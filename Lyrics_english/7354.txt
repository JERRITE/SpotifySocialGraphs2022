[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Now, I just fell in love
And I just quit my job
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm lookin' for motivation
I'm lookin' for a new foundation, yeah
And I'm on that new vibration
I'm buildin' my own foundation, yeah
Hold up, oh, baby, baby

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You won't break my soul (Na, na)
You won't break my soul (No-no, na, na)
You won't break my soul (No-no, na, na)
You won't break my soul (Na, na)
And I'm tellin' everybody (Everybody)
Everybody (Everybody)

The queens in the front and thе Doms in the back
Ain't takin' no flicks but the whole cliquе snapped
There's a whole lot of people in the house
Tryin' to smoke with the yak in your mouth

You said you outside, but you ain't that outside
Worldwide hoodie with the mask outside
In case you forgot how we act outside
