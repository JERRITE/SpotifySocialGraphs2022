2/10 Lyrics[Chorus: One Acen & Tion Wayne]
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
Yo
(Diztortion)
T Wayne from the 9

[Chorus: One Acen]
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
I swear I'll never go through that again
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
Wallahi, I'll never go through that again
[Verse 1: Tion Wayne & One Acen]
Yo, I ain't sure about love
Notorious like Biggie and Puff
Uh-huh, they wan' see me get cuffed
Rub me wrong way, right way, I just bust (Ooh)
Me, I don't trust (Yeah)
Love gets complex
Girl looking Cardi B, she need an Offset
Wanna spend time with me because I cut cheques (Money)
Just need a diamond piece the way my watch set
Ex looking upset
Uh
I just need a ride or die chick to (Wifey)
Ace told me fame-digging girls are (Pricey)
But them thick thighs got me hypnotised, love
I'ma give it a try
But let me slip it inside

[Chorus: One Acen]
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
I swear I'll never go through that again
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
Wallahi, I'll never go through that again
You might also like[Verse 2: One Acen]
All my dogs think I'm trolling them (Uh-huh)
I don't wanna be no Romeo (I was)
I believe you're the only one (Now it's)
No time for these hoes (Woo)
I got my drip right, I've been glowing up
Now I'm in the game, got my trophies up (Believe it)
She wanna know if I'm old enough (I replied)
Baby, I'm balling for the both of us, ayy (Uh-huh)
Might be wrong, I might be right
I pay the cost, I don't like the price
You can fool me once, you won't blind me twice
No, no, no
No, no, no

[Chorus: One Acen]
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
I swear I'll never go through that again
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
Wallahi, I'll never go through that again

[Verse 3: Tion Wayne]
On a case, got plenty (Uh-huh)
If you need a real one, I'll recommend me (Yeah, yeah)
Give her couple children, cover her in Fendi (Fendi)
Ain't done love before, I gotta trust before she get the Bentley (Bentley)
With a girl that is ten out of ten (Ten)
Fucking her again ('Gain)
Told my bro, "Never cuff these hoes, she'll have you looking like a clown in the end"
[Chorus: One Acen]
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
I swear I'll never go through that again
Love is a two out of ten
Wouldn't recommend
Told my bros I'm a rolling stone
Wallahi, I'll never go through that againEmbed
