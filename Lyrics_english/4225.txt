Wrap Lyricsyo well .. (Don't fool yourself)
I am that ganster that made you a woman
I know well .. (hey don't lie to me)
What do you think of me when you are with him
I know well .. (Tony Dize)
I know many things that nobody knows .. (the melody of the street)
You know well that I am your man
(Nestyy Solve)

Wrap yourself
If I am your cat and you are my cat
Then wrap yourself
Run with mine, it will not be anything
Wrap yourself
Girl talk to me clearly, look at me face
Mami wrap
Because fear
(Zumba Tony Dize)
I have to end
With that, that fact
I can't see that he makes you cry
And make you suffer
When he comes for you at the time he wants
And if I loved you, it overwhelms my envy
I feel that my pride bends and breaks
Is that I would like
Even if it's a minute to change for

Wrap yourself
If I am your cat and you are my cat
Then wrap yourself
Run with mine, it will not be anything
Wrap yourself
Girl talk to me clearly, look at me face
Mami wrap

Because fear

I realized that she feels something the same
I see her nervous when she sees me pass
AUNKKE I TRY IT I CAN'T HIDE IT
I know he likes it and I'm going to take it

I realized that she feels something the same
Becomes nervous when he sees me pass
AUNKKE I TRY IT I CAN'T HIDE IT
I know he likes it and I'm going to take it
