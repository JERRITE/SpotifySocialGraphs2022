Lightning in a Bottle Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out in the wild, party in nowhere land
We start a fire, sparklers in every hand
No phones, let go, cut all the strings tonight
Singin' aloud, howlin' right at the moon
We're making out, life's never felt so good
Bring on the storm, we're wilin' out tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you lost your shoes as it started to rain
And your jeans soaked through
But you smiled anyway
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air, hearts in the air
[Chorus]
We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath, we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow

[Verse 3]
Back of the car, blankets and me and you
We're running on perfectly wasted youth
I'll hold you close, we'll call this home tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And the fake tattoo that you drew on my arm
Had an X and an O, never change who you are
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air, hearts in the air

[Chorus]
We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath, we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow

Hearts in the air, hearts in the air, hearts in the air
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air, hearts in the air, hearts in the air

[Chorus]
We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah, we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah, we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow

[Outro]
Here in the afterglow
(Hearts in the air, hearts in the air)
(Throw our hearts in the air, hearts in the air)
Here in the afterglow
(Hearts in the air, hearts in the air)
(Throw our hearts in the air)
Here in the afterglow1Embed
