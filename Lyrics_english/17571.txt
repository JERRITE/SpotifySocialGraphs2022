My Umbrella* LyricsLyrics from snippet

She said, "Don, I wanna live this life forever"
Round around town, big Draco, my umbrella
Yeah, ride around and it's cold
Ain't no cameras in the crib, baby, just keep that shit on the low
Ain't no cameras in the crib unless I mix the Marni with the Rick
She like how I put that shit on, woah-You might also likeEmbed
