Lyrics Cachito ["Cachito" letter]

[Verse 1]
I'm scared
That silence now be with whom I sleep
I'm scared
That time becomes slower

[Post-car]
If you are not, if you leave
Tell me who will calm my anxiety
If I'm leaving, if I'm not
We will gather the moon and the sun
[Pre-car]
Take a little cache of my heart
Your shirt with my smell
Pa 'that hugs you every night
Take the memory of those days
The beach and a village
And what we promised last night

[Chorus]
Take, take, take
Oh, take the sin hours
Takeatе, take, take
Oh, take everything, that ours is sacred

[Post-car]
If you leave, if you are not
I will not be able to let you think
And if you miss me, if you miss me (Yeah)
If you miss me, give me a call (Aló?)

[Verse 2]
Mommy, tell me "I want" and flying back (aha)
Pa 'a quiet polvito', thrown on the floor (mmm)
And with the full tank we go to the club
We ask all the bottles, the ones you want
Oh, mommy, like Jackie Chan
We circled the plan
A leg here (here, here)
And another leg over there (there)
Mommy, like Jackie Chan
We circled the plan
A leg here
Another leg over there

Take a little cache of my heart
Your shirt with my smell
Pa 'that hugs you every night
Take the memory of those days
The beach and a birra
And what we promised last night (last night baby)

[Chorus]
Take, take, take yourself
Take everything, but stay here by my side, baby
Take, take, take yourself
Take everything, that ours is sacred

[Post-car]
If you are not, if you leave
Tell me who will calm my anxiety
If I'm leaving, if I'm not
We will gather the moon and the sun

[Pre-car]
Take a little cache of my heart
Your shirt with my smell
Pa 'that hugs you every night
Take the memory of those days
The beach and a birra
And what we promised last night
[Chorus]
Take, take, take yourself
Take everything, but stay here by my side, baby
Take, take, take yourself
Oh, take everything, that ours is sacred

[Outro]
(Take, take, huh
Take, take, take me)
Don't go babyBed
