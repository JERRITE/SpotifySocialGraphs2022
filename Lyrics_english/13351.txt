Dog Teeth Lyrics[Verse 1]
He handed me a pair of pliers
And he told me to pull out his teeth
Because as long as he had them
He'd use them to do bad things

[Chorus]
You're cold on the inside
There's a dog in your heart
And it tells you to tear everything apart
My body's covered in teeth marks
Your bite's worse than your bark
You ruin everything you touch
And destroy anyone you love
You're all over me
[Verse 2]
He'd sunk his teeth into the flesh of many others
Infecting them with whatever was already inside him
He'd broken all their hymens
Cut them open, and played inside them
He'd hollowed out their bodies
So they'd feel just empty as him

[Chorus]
You're cold on the inside
There's a dog in your heart
And it tells you to tear everything apart
You draw blood just to taste it
You hold bones just to break them
You ruin everything you touch
And destroy anyone you love
You're all over meYou might also like4Embed
