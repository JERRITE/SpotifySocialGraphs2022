Home Movies Lyrics[Intro]
Just like the movies
She said, "Kene"
"Where'd you go when you go away " (Hey)
I don't know, but I'd like to stay (aye)
I can't take, no not today (woo)
But

[Bridge]
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (ho)
Say my name, say my name (c'mon)
Say my name, say my name
[Chorus]
I told her we could make that movie at home
I told her we ain't gotta go nowhere
I told her we could make that movie at home
And we don't gotta go, we don't gotta go

[Verse]
Tell me what you like (oh, yeah)
I can think about you till I make you recognize
Look me in the eyes
Look me in the eyes
We don't have to, no
We don't have to, no (no)

[Chorus]
I told her we could make that movie at home
I told her we ain't gotta go nowhere
I told her we could make that movie at home
And we don't gotta go, we don't gotta go
(Name)

[Bridge]
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (ho)
Say my name, say my name (c'mon)
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (yeah)
Say my name, say my name (ho)
Say my name, say my name (c'mon)
