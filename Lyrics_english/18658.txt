Youâ€™ve Got Another Thing Coming Lyrics[Verse 1]
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud

[Chorus 1]
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of "do or die"
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go? You're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
[Verse 2]
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

[Chorus 2]
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go? You're mad
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'




[Bridge]
In this world we're livin' in, we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in, aim for a new tomorrow

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh so hot, no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough, ain't room for second best
Real strong, got me some security
Hey, I'm a big smash, I'm goin' for infinity yeah

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of "do or die"
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go? You're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'

[Outro]
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'
You got another thing comin'Embed
