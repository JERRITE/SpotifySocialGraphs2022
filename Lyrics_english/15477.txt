Love Lyrics Universe [Lyrics for "Universe Love" FT. Silvana Estrada]

[Verse 1]
You moved to my heart
No permission, without a reason
I promised to say no
Surprised in full construction
Resanating the damage that happened
Without warning now we are two

[Verse 2]
Before you arrive
I was in remodeling
When I least expected you took care of everything
If you bring me the sun, don't forget, don't
That it is possible to see new hours to the clock
Love Universe, who lives here today
[Bridge]
You moved to my heart
With a suitcase full of illusion
Make dreams in the room
Before you arrived, I was in remodeling
When I least expected you took care of everything

[Chorus]
If you bring me the sun, do not forget, no
That it is possible to see new hours to the clock
Love Universe, who lives here today, unstoppable
I hugged my calm into my tremor
Let's sail between skies
Go out of open sea

[Outro]
Love Universe, who lives here today, unstoppable
I hugged my calm into my tremor
If you bring me the sun, don't forget not
That it is very possible to see new hours to the clock
