Running from Me LyricsSay a prayer for me, 'cause I can barely breathe
I'm suffering, and I can't take it
Because of me, no one will ever see this side of me
If I don't make it

It’s like I can't wake up, it’s like I can’t get up
It’s like I can’t remember who I used to be
Am I running from you or am I running from me?
It’s like I can’t wake up, it's like I can’t get up
It’s like I can’t remember who I used to be
Am I running from you or am I running from me?
Clear a path for me, cause I can barely see
I'm stumbling and I can't shake it
It’s up to me to save myself from me, my enemy but I can't face it

It’s like I can't wake up, it’s like I can’t get up
It’s like I can’t remember who I used to be
Am I running from you or am I running from me?
It’s like I can't wake up, it’s like I can’t get up
It’s like I can’t remember who I used to be
Am I running from you or am I running from me?

I’m breaking out
I’m breaking out
I’m breaking out
I’m breaking out
I’m breaking out
Here I come, here I come, here I come
I can't
Wake
Up
‘Cause I'm not around
Am I running from you or am I running from me?

It’s like I can't wake up, it’s like I can’t get up
It’s like I can’t remember who I used to be
Am I running from you?
Can’t face myself, I'm just left with the sufferingYou might also likeEmbed
