Canâ€™t Believe Lyrics(carl thomas)
I always dreamed that everything
Would be ok with me and you
But I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes
I didn't see all the things
I used to see
Whats going on

(faith evans)
You gave me reason to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby baby pleases
No more....no more
Chorus
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
Guess i'll be leaving, no deceiving; its official
I'm emotional

(faith evans)
I can't forget that night
I saw you in the corner wrapped up tight
You were wrong
Slow dancing on the floor
While i was watching from the door so hurt
There you were

You gave me reason to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby baby pleases
No more....no more

Chorus

(both)
You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes you did)
Thought you had my love always (no ba-by)
I don't understand (i dont understand)
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness
