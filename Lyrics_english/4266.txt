Greater than me 3 lyrics [letter of "greater than me 3" ft. Don Omar, Wisin, Yandel & Daddy Yankee]

[Intro: Yandel, Daddy Yankee & Wisin]
Luny
I was crazy to see you, eager to have you
I want to go back to your side (more flow 3)
No matter what people say
I swear, ma'am, I never failed
(W, Yandel, Oky, King Don Omar)
(The best of all time, dy)
[Saying: Yandel & Daddy Yankee]
They said that because you are less than you, I did not want it (Latinos, stand up)
That was not love just interest, and here I am still (Ajá)
And although time passes it well
I am that boy who made you feel a woman
Being older than me
(Luny Tunes, Mas Flow 3)

[Verse 1: Don Omar & Daddy Yankee]
(Dad arrived, Don!)
Lady, I like it so much, just like the first day
Welcome to the Third Dynasty
Those who wanted (You know) come together
To fulfill all your fantasies (the hard one)
With that experience is that you have conquered me
It is crazy, it has me in love
And that belt like it has not changed
And I want to have it tonight (Don, Don, Don)
There in my bed
Two Bodies Calentao ', I pledge' in flames (zumba)
The rum that lasts until 3 in the morning
I Forever Dad, You Forever Mom
Oh, evil with mind of perverse
How to accelerate when it puts the reverse
It clashes with the hinter hunting the dam
Do not lower the border vamo 'to kill us (Don)

That I love him greater than me, than me
That gives me heat, give me your love
I educate myself in experience, leave me crazy
He took me to bed and make me hallucinate
That I love him greater than me, that me (what?)
That gives me heat, give me your love
I educate myself in experience, leave me crazy
He took me to bed and make me hallucinate
(Zu-Zu-Zu-Zu-Zu-Zumba)

[Verse 2: wisin]
Monday to Friday has a boyfriend, but Saturday leaves it (double)
Appears on Sunday with Pende's face— Weh
She dresses face and the guy is complex (aha)
That the Tiguere is his favorite, he told me in his ear
My lady, healthy, rich, zero calories
You have not changed at all, you are still pastry
I want to kiss you again, would you like?
I brought you a surprise from Victoria, would you model it to me?
That body has not changed (heh), you have me hypnotized (heh)
Always fine, makeup, tremendous footwear (W)
Let's remember the past, I'm already desperate
Let's complete what we have not finished
Wild cat (Frontúa), by Tinker Bell El Tatuaje (Ajá)
When he is alone at home he calls me to work (always)
The amount on my journey, she wants killing (you know ')
It has no dress under the suit
[Saying: Don Omar & Yandel]
They said that being less than you
I didn't want her (don't say 'that)
That was not love just interest (they were wrong)
And here I am still (Yes, Babe)
And although time passes it well, that I am that (You know)
Boy who made you feel a woman (The One)
Being older than me

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee]
OKEY
The best of all time
The Goat
DA-DDY
Fuimo '!
And I like the ripe fruit that is allowed to eat
When I fight you there, I'm going to bite you, heh
How good you keep me blood boils me
The woman is like wine and you are the best reserve (let's go)

[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
He wants me to tell him, he wants me to tell him, give him, mommy, teach me
Wants me to tell you that in bed you are the one who knows
Give me affectionate, heart, give me cariñito, heart
There is no man who dome when she squeezes
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, I was wild
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, hold the voltage
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, Save Me Motete
The mare that is asked was
Damo 'pa' that respects

[Verse 4: Yandel & Daddy Yankee]
It has me crazy, I am convinced
That you leave with me even if I look for a mess
I do not force you, I follow me or I follow you
Calm that we are going on here
I know that repentant I will not stay
Among my sheets I will find you
You know that I am the man, who well knows you
Being your greatest than me (fuimo '!)

[Choir: Daddy Yankee & Don Omar]
That I love him greater than me, than me
That gives me heat, give me your love (the towers)
I educate myself in experience, it drives me crazy
He took me to bed and make me hallucinate (Don!)
That I love him greater than me, than me
That gives me heat, give me your love
I educate myself in experience, leave me crazy
He took me to bed and make me hallucinate (fuimo ')

[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
He wants me to tell him, he wants me to tell him, give him, mommy, teach me
Wants me to tell you that in bed you are the one who knows
Give me affectionate, heart, give me cariñito, heart
There is no man who dome when she squeezes
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, I was wild
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, hold the voltage
Ah-Oh, Ah-Oh, Save Me Motete
The mare that is asked was
Damo 'pa' that respects
