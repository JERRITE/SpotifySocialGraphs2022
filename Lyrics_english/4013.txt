The Lyricsletra adventurer of "The Adventurer" FT. YELSID

I want dawn dancing
With the woman I want
Thus say the whole world
That I am a sinner

Yes when love comes
There is no excuse, or but
But I hope this time
Do not pay me with betrayal
The day I saw her, of a super that was her
She that so beautiful woman is made for me
Tired of suffering and uncovering bottles
I finally light a star and this choir says like this

I am the adventurer
The world matters little to me
NOBODY SAY I LOVE YOU
But you have me crazy

I'm adventurer, I do what I want
But if you love you too I love you
To feel your skin, your mouth flavored me
And if you want I can also be your faithful dog

People don't matter, what they have to say
That they take office and let them live
I am not a womanizer if love is blind, simply
I am already tired of suffering

I am the adventurer
And the world cared little
NOBODY SAY I LOVE YOU
But you have me crazy

I am the adventurer
The world matters little to me
NOBODY SAY I LOVE YOU
But you have me crazy
You might Also Likenadie said love is so
Sometimes to laugh, also to suffer
That is why I no longer maintain fear
To feel pain, today I want to have a better time

And if you only leave me
And if it is worth following
I hope you don't want to go
Why will I learn
To live without you

I want dawn dancing
With the woman I want
Thus say the whole world
That I am a sinner

Yes when love comes
There is no excuse, or but
But I hope this time
Do not pay me with betrayal


The day I saw her, of a super that was her
She that so beautiful woman is made for me
Tired of suffering and uncovering bottles
I finally light a star and this choir says like this
I am the adventurer
Hit
Hit
