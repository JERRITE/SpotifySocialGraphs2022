After me Lyrics [verse 1: Anahí & Dulce María]
I have a ticket without return
And a lot of dreams inside a velí
A goodbye for my old people, a lot of fear
And eager to live

[Pre-car: Anahí and Maite]
Open wings to escape endless
To find freedom
Far from here, far from here
[Chorus: RBD]
A guitar and my childhood
The school and my first time
Friends that I have not seen again
They are staying behind me
A cigarette, a song
THE PHOTOS OF THE FIRST LOVE
Memories in my room
They are staying behind me

[Post-car: Anahí]
Oh, being behind me
Staying behind me
After me, oh oh

[Verse 2: Alfonso & Christian]
I have a lump in the throat
I have a map that takes me to another country
The attempt of a letter
A story and eager to live

[Pre-car: Anahí and Maite]
Open wings to escape endless
To find freedom
Far from here, far from here

Oh, being behind me
Staying behind me
After me, oh oh

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus: RBD]
A guitar and my childhood
The school and my first time
Friends that I have not seen again
They are staying behind me
A cigarette, a song
THE PHOTOS OF THE FIRST LOVE
Memories in my room
They are staying behind me
A guitar and my childhood
The school and my first time
Friends that I have not seen again
They are staying behind me
A cigarette, a song
THE PHOTOS OF THE FIRST LOVE
Memories in my room
They are staying behind me

[Outro: RBD]
A guitar and my childhood
