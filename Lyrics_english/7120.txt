Put U On Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's so different (So different)
Kind of girl you show off to your niggas (Your niggas)
Doin' things you wouldn't, takin' pictures (Pictures)
'Cause I got that effect on you, yeah, yeah
Don't need no filters (No filters)
Do it my way, boss up makin' figures (Figures)
Feel no type of way 'bout them other bitches (Bitches)
'Cause I got that effect on you, on you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' you might not be used to (Hey)
I'm gonna show you that new-new (I will)
Got you connected like Bluetooth (Yeah)
Put a spell on you, that voodoo
Get mad at me, you come right back (Right back)
Can't let me go, 'cause you like that (Hahaha)
I could change your life, so get ready, yeah (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I'ma put you on (Hey)
I'ma turn you out (Yeah)
I'ma bless you up (Up)
I'ma hold you down (Yeah)
I'ma wake you up (I will)
Show you what's up (What's up)
I'ma put you onto somethin', baby (Hey)
'Cause you don't know my love (Yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, babe, oh yeah (Oh yeah, oh)
'Cause you don't know my love
My love babe, oh-oh, baby
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Don't worry 'bout nothin' (Don't)
Baby, don't worry 'bout nothin' when you're with me (Yeah, yeah)
I won't pay no mind 'bout nobody
Around you, when you're next to me (Yeah)
When you're next to me, oh-oh, oh-oh
Put your drink up (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody up here, 'round here lookin' at us
They lookin' at me with a body that you get to touch
All night (All night)
That's right (That's right)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I might be somethin' you might not get used to
I'm gonna show you that new-new
Got you connected like Bluetooth
Put a spell on you, that voodoo
Get mad at me, you come right back
Can't let me go, 'cause you like that
I'ma change your life, so get ready, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma put you on (Hey)
I'ma turn you out (Out)
I'ma bless you up (Hey)
I'ma hold you down (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'ma wake you up (Hey)
Show you what's up
I'ma put you onto somethin', baby
'Cause you don't know my love (My love)
Oh-oh, babe, oh, ooh-woah, oh
'Cause you don't know my love
My love babe, oh-oh, baby (Hey)
Oh-oh-ohEmbed
