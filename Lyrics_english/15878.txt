I still think of Lyricsquiza was not coincidence
Find me with you again ...

I would like just for this time
Steal with a look
A kiss that reaches you to the soul
And that the world knew
What is between you and me
This silence is killing me please

And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
I know you feel the same today
And I still miss you
I do not know how
Nor when I went crazy for you
Tell me what do I do if this couch
Has chosen you
I still think
Always imagining, oh
I don't promise you to fall in love
Before conquering you
Let's go step by step
There is no poequo rush
I carry thirty summers in the luggage
So that the lady did not stress
And relax

A whatsapp send you and don't answer me
Is him, he who does not want
But then he is interested
Let's be friends
I know you feel the same

And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
I know you feel the same today
And I still miss you
I do not know how
Nor when I went crazy for you
Tell me what do I do if this couch
Has chosen you

Tell what I do, oh, ay, ay
Tell me what do I do ...
If this little heart has chosen you
Who was not coincidence, Carlos
Is that I still think
If meeting you was the destination for me

Do not tell me how it was, nor for what
What matters now
Is that you are so alone
Now get that nail draw
Tell him that you are with me
That I am your slave
And I'm not your friend

And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
I wouldn't want anything halfway
Or I'm your queen or you don't see me

And I still miss you
I do not know how
Nor when I went crazy for you
Tell me what do I do if this couch
Has chosen you
And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
I know you feel the same today
And I still miss you
I do not know how
Nor when I went crazy for you
Sometimes I read fate
And that's why I'm still here

And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
Everything is written
Especially destiny

And I still think
Every time imagining
When you pass it with me
Tell me what do I do if this couch
Has chosen you

I still think
Always imagining
I know you feel the same today
And I still miss you
I do not know how
Nor when I went crazy for you
Tell me what do I do if this couch
He has chosen you
