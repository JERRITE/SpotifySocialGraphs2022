TranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsSweet Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
On my pillow
Can't get me tired
Sharing my fragile truth
That I still hope the door is open
’Cause the window
Opened one time with you and me
Now my forever's falling down
Wondering if you'd want me now

[Chorus]
How could I know
One day, I’d wake up feeling more
But I had already reached the shore
Guess we were ships in the night, night, night
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
We were ships in the night, night, night
[Verse 2]
I'm wondering, are you my best friend?
Feels like a river's rushing through my mind
I wanna ask you if this is all just in my head
My heart is pounding tonight, I wonder
If you are too good to be true
And would it be alright if I
Pulled you closer

[Chorus]
How could I know
One day, I'd wake up feeling more
But I had already reached the shore
Guess we were ships in the night, night, night
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
We were ships in the night, night, nightYou might also like72Embed
