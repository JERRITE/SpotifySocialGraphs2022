My Brother The Moon (Interlude) Lyrics[Chorus]
Me and the moon
Me and the moon

[Verse 1]
I look into the sky at night and I see you shining bright
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be up there with your light
I don't know why I think about it but it feels so right
And to everyone trying to bring me down I would be out of sight

[Pre-Chorus]
My brother the moon
I'll be with you soon
[Chorus]
Me and the moon
Me and the moon

[Verse 2]
I'd never be satisfied with this big green orb of mine
I won't be happy until I am up there flying high
Looking down at the earth like a shining star in the sky
'Cause I know that up there there is no one that I despise

[Pre-Chorus]
My brother the moon
I'll be with you soon

[Chorus]
Me and the moon
Me and the moonYou might also likeEmbed
