Anywhere With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walked in straight away and slammed the door last night
I caught you on the couch, you were having a fright all alone
With the TV on
Clothes strewn on the floor, I got down on my knees
You told me everything that you wanted to be all along
Was it wrong?

[Chorus]
And I said, "Listen, oh, I know it's been a long, long year
But I think we should go and get you out of here"
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
Pack up all your shit and put it in the back
Maybe the miles can make up for the things you lack
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
[Verse 2]
Cruising 95 like we got nothing to lose
I'm praying to the headlights like I prayеd to you
Before I found you
Roll the windows down, kill thе radio
I'd rather hear the wind than hear that song I'm supposed to know
By some fucking bro

[Chorus]
You tell me that forever couldn't come too soon
I wanna lose my mind in a hotel room with you
Anywhere would do
I'm sittin' in the bath like it's pouring rain
You call me from the hall just to say my, say my name
I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere with you

[Bridge]
Would you tell me if I ever started holding you back?
Would you talk me off the guard rail of my panic attack?
Look me straight in my center and tell me from the heart
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to start?
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to start?
Are you ready to start?
You might also like[Chorus]
You tell me that forever couldn't come too soon
If I'm gonna lose my mind, I'm gonna lose it with you
You tell me you want everything, you want it fast
But all I've ever wanted is to make something fucking last
I'll go anywhere, I'll go anywhere, I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you1Embed
