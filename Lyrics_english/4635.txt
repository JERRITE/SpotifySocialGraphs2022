RIP Young Lyrics[Intro]
Mane, you know what's going, you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine-hunnid strong, I got Ps, I got coke
Mane, you know what's going, you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine-hunnid strong, I got Ps, I got coke (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
We work to work, you late to work, I holla, then they send it (Why?)
You know my plot was colder than Chicago in December ('Cember)
My bitch came up in Inglewood, her mama was her daddy
And when I'm in the Midwest, she say holla at your family (Holla at me)
My dog pass me that cup (What it do?), taste like candy, bitch (Yeah)
My dog out layin' down the law, ain't breakin' no laws or serving out the rock (Bitch)
Southside still fuckin' in the car, still flippin' in the car, still shootin' out the car (Still shootin' out the car)
Lil' hotbox smokin' our jar, now I'm fuckin' on a star, hold up, I got a call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
Bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot
Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts (Yeah), yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog
Every time we hit the red lights, just shine
It ain't nothin' but a good day, don't die
They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin', I don't wanna lose count
Talkin' my shit, it was just us, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck it, I'll drive, hop in my ride
Pass me that dutch, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On the westside, on the 110
Swingin' my nuts (Ayy, swingin' my nuts)
Fuck it, let's grill, fuck it, let's spill
Spend a few crumbs (Ayy, spend a fewâ€”)
Pop Smoke, pop shit, pop bitch
Young nigga, don't pop too much (Ayy, ayy)
Spaceships, fake broke, Kanye
Young nigga, don't stay too long (Yeah, ah, ah, yeah)
Big truck, big wheel, big wop
Them niggas probably hate my guts (Ah, ah, yeah)
Tryna gain my trust (Tryna gain my)
But it's all out of lust (I said)
