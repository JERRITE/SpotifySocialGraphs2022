Sunroof (Loud Luxury Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You’re making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

[Buildup]
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da
[Drop]
I got my head out the sunroof
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da

[Chorus]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You’re making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
I got my head out the sunroof (Sunroof)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
I'm feeling like this might be my timе
To shine with you, with you, with you

[Chorus]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favoritе tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
