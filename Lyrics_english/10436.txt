Better Than I Know Myself Lyrics[Intro]
(Don't you know me–)

[Verse 1]
I can't read you like a magazine
Can't even see you right in front of me talking
Your lips are moving, I don't hear a thing
No, you're not getting through to me
And I know you'd rather–

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the other cheek
But you hit me up a thousand times a week
Scared to tell you that I don't want you to leave
'Cause I know you could
Yeah, I know you could
[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know mysеlf?

[Verse 2]
I can't even hold a flame to it
Struggling to find a namе to call it
Wonder if I'm being obvious
Maybe I'm acting out a wish
That you'd never go and

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the other cheek
You used to hit me up a thousand times a week
Scared to tell you that I don't want you to leave
'Cause I know you could
Yeah, oh, I know you could

[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know myself?

[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know myself?

[Outro]
(Don't you know me–)
Better than I know myself, better than I know myself
(Don't you know me–)
Better than I know myself, better than I know myself
(Don't you know me–)1Embed
