MONSTER Lyrics[Intro]
(Census, what you cookin'?)

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
Walking on the line (Line)
Floatin' in the sky (Sky)
Screaming, "We don't really feel no more"
Stuck and can't make up my mind
Show me that you love me barely
I'ma show you how I'm feeling with my words
Lil' baby, I'm a monster
Baby, I'm the curse
I know this whore gon' do it proper
Show me how it works
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst, yeah (Uh)
[Verse 1: Dro Kenji]
Shawty want my heart from me but my shit barely work
If I finish off this Henny, I could probably leave this Earth
I've been running from my problems
Bought my German bitch a purse
Like everything I rock еxotic
Got the 'Cat and a Trackhawk
Look like I ain't got no worries
Diamonds cold and not onе blurry
I can hear the cash calling
Falling down like money flurry
Rich like I forget my burdens
I can tell you if it's worth it
No one love you any more
So I'm gon' keep my heart 'cause I've been

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
Walking on the line (Line)
Floatin' in the sky (Sky)
Screaming, "We don't really feel no more"
Stuck and can't make up my mind
Show me that you love me barely
I'ma show you how I'm feeling with my words
Lil' baby, I'm a monster
Baby, I'm the curse
I know this whore gon' do it proper
Show me how it works
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst, yeah (Uh)

I run with eagles, I'm not Jalen Hurts
But I'm stealin' jewelry
Rappers can't step on my turf with no helmet and no cleats
I turned Hollywood to Hollyhood, that blicky on me
I keep waking up them demons tryna take my soul from me
Leaning off the pain (Pain)
I can see the rain (Rain)
Know that I don't need no more (No more)
808, I keep that bop
If it was old days, I would walk around with a sword
My dark shades Louis V (Uh, uh, uh)
I can't even see (Uh, uh, uh)
Someone after me (Uh, uh, uh)
But I'm still (But I'm still)

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
Walking on the line (Line)
Floatin' in the sky (Sky)
Screaming, "We don't really feel no more"
Stuck and can't make up my mind
Show me that you love me barely
I'ma show you how I'm feeling with my words
Lil' baby, I'm a monster
Baby, I'm the curse
I know this whore gon' do it proper
Show me how it works
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst
It's like I'm living in a nightmare
I've been through the worst (Uh)Embed
