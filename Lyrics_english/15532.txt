I do not ask you the moon Lyrics [letter of "I do not ask you the moon"]

[Verse 1]
I want to wrap you in my arms
That there is no space between you and me, Na-Ah-Ah
Be the taste of your mouth
And fill me all with your aroma, Na-Ah-Ah
Be a confidant
And know who you are, Na-Ah-Ah
Like a live tattoo
Impregnate me in your being
Do not erase from you, Na-Ah-Ah
[Chorus]
I do not ask the moon
I just want to love you
I want to be that madness
That vibrates very within you, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask the moon
I only ask you for the moment
To rescue that skin
And steal that star that
We see you and I make love, Na-Ah-Ah

[Verse 2]
Run against the wind
Know all your feelings, Na-Ah-Ah
Two intertwined bodies
Let's wait for all the winters, Na-Ah-Ah
Kiss Me
And on my lips you will find heat, Na-Ah-Ah
Feel me
Fragile and paper
As I tremble for you, Na-Ah-Ah

[Chorus]
I do not ask the moon
I just want to love you
I want to be that madness
That vibrates very within you, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask the moon
I only ask you for the moment
To rescue this skin
And steal that star that
We see you and I make love, Na-Ah-Ah

I do not ask you the moon, ah
I just want to have you
Very close to me, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask you the moon, ah
I just want to give myself
Forever to you, Na-Ah-Ah
NA-AH-AH
NA-NA-NA
Na-na-ni-na-na
Na-ni-na-ni-na-na
Na, na, ni-na-ni

[Chorus]
I do not ask the moon
I just want to love you
I want to be that madness
That vibrates very within you, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask the moon
I only ask you for the moment
To rescue that skin
And steal that star that
We see you and I make love, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask the moon
I just want to love you
I want to be that madness
That vibrates very within you, Na-Ah-Ah
I do not ask the moon
I only ask for the moment
