Drive Me Mad Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you walk my whole world shakes
When you speak my cold heart breaks
You're 'bout the best I never had
Want your love, it drives me mad
Want your love, it drives me

[Chorus]
You's so good, I got it bad
I want your love, it drives me mad
[Verse 2]
Nothing else on my mind
Those heavy hips and lips like wine
Feel it rush straight to head
Moves like that'll leave a poor boy dead
Moves like that'll leave a poor boy

[Chorus]
You's so good, I got it bad
I want your love, it drives me mad

[Bridge]
You got your hand on the pistol, honey
You got your hand on the blade
You got your hand on the pistol, honey
Go on and make my day
You got your hand on the pistol, honey
You got your hand on the blade
You got your hand on the pistol, honey
Danger's on the way

[Chorus]
You's so good, I got it bad
I want your love, it drives me madYou might also likeEmbed
