Great Adventures Lyrics[Intro]
Where we at with it, Ali?
It's ConCreatures
Blockworks, let's get it

[Verse]
Was hoppin' out that black van (Like the A-Team)
Them hard times had a nigga in all black, robbin' like I was Batman (Yeah)
Heard he sittin' on a pack, bleed him like a Tampax (Brr)
Run up in his pad, a nigga spig's gettin' ram shacked
Last pill I took, went on a bad trip (We thought)
But the man from my dark past'll leave you in the past tense (Uh)
Spot off a crack spit, we cop them crashed whips
Weigh the work wet, let it dry on the napkin (Skrrt)
Chauncey want a Billups, Chucky want a Atkins (227)
Cuddy doin' twenty dollar fill-ups, swipin' on the platinum Mastercard
Head nigga back in charge, slap you with a hundred large
Mirror in his back pocket, he just practice lookin' hard
Whippin' crack up in the pot, cookin' up in pickle jars
Had a drive-through trap on West Grand Boulevard
Doggy just a yes man, I heard the nigga took a charge
Over some merch, lift up his shirt, can see the bullet scars
Just took the staples out his stomach 'bout a month ago
He took off with a cake and we chopped up his mother bungalow (Skrrt)
Got snatched up by the detectives, wanna know what I know
We only let off fifty but this clip come with a hundred more
Servin' all the clucks in the O, I was next to blow (Ayy)
Had to line my ducks in a row, tell 'em check the score
Three seconds left, inbound pass was Scottie Pippen (Shoot)
We got the game tied up, Ali, stop trippin' (We scorin')
