Zombie Lyrics[Chorus]
Only when it’s dark out
Only when it’s dark out
We move when it’s dark out
We live when it’s dark out
Bitch, I am a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
And I get no sleep (No sleep)
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie

[Verse 1: Madchild]
Ay, Madchild got that gangrene
Setting in, my [?]
Act and talk like I’m angry
You can see my whole gang, me
Eat your face like a tangerine
Dismantling, I keep mangling
Los Angeles to Columbus
To Tennessee, we all family
Room full of zombies
That never ran, never hided
This ain’t no fantasy island, brah
I’m a man at his violent, brah
Don’t abandon our rydas
It’s always standin’ beside us
This shit is Z war, expose ya mind
We all recourt, become C4 (Bring it!)
I depend on my soldiers
But I still keep my composure
I keep my enemies closer
And tell ‘em everything’s Kosher
But I don’t sleep, so it’s over
Man’s a venomous cobra
Bite a hole out ya face
Bring ya life to a closure
[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m a zombie
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Bitch, I am a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Only when it’s dark out
Only when it’s dark out
We move when it’s dark out
We live when it’s dark out
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep (No sleep)
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Hey, you’re looking at a mother fucking monster
I’m a demon sent from Hell, I’m under your bed
I’m in your closet and at your concert
And if you filled it, you’ve been bothered
By any one of these products
Society has came to me
Let it be known, speak it’s proper
Off my rocker, I can go front to back
Left to right, straight side to side
I can put two bad bitches off at your whip
We call it that Compton ride
Memphis Ten, we gets it in
Up all night, we see the flips
You fuck around and get a sneak peak
Of next week’s extended clip
Round here, death is a trip
First 48 done left the state
Had to get back somewhere to save them
Tennessee boys will eat your face
Me and totem pole roll everywhere
In this bitch, we gonna kill everything
Me and totem pole back up in this bitch
We killin’ everything
You might also like[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m a zombie
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Bitch, I am a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Only when it’s dark out
Only when it’s dark out
We move when it’s dark out
We live when it’s dark out
Bitch, I am zombie (Zombie, zombie)
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep (No sleep)
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope & Violent J]
When the sun go down, I do my dirt
Paint up, wicked clown, bitches ‘bout to get hurt
Heh, eyes sunken, forehead sweatin’, body shaken, epileptic
Blind rage runnin’ through your whole crew like a pandemic
Body count stackin’, show these fools what I’m all about
Open that mouth, I’m quick to add a fuckin’ ass out
Speed on, peon, before you get peed on
And when the sun come up, believe your boy will be gone
Shit, it’s so fuckin’ dark out, I can’t even see my hands
I suffer from a type of sick no doctor understands
I’m from the badlands of the motor city
Street lights broken, rooms are shitty
Hookers all corroded titties
Hungry so I’m growin’ giddy
I’m a zombie, limpin’ down the avenue
Come up on me, this wicked clown is grabbin’ you
Take a jab at you, stab slice off a slab or two
Then gladly chew, rip you to pieces like I’m mad at you
[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m a zombie
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Bitch, I am a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Only when it’s dark out
Only when it’s dark out
We move when it’s dark out
We live when it’s dark out
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep (No sleep)
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie

[Verse 4: Jelly Roll]
I’m such a fuckin’ menace
I’m fucked up and demented
Don’t feed me after midnight
I’m a motherfuckin gremlin
I’m attracted to magic
Darkness, rachet, and savage
Family’s bad apples
With battle axes and hatches
That psychopathic illmatic murderous shit
Only the real underground has ever heard of this shit
With the same torch I carried in
Burnt the bodies and buried it
Illuminati’s scared of him
Heard he was Lucifarian
I believe in Jesus, so really this shit’s hilarious
Oh, so sweet chariot, miss me with your comparisons
Front of a long line
Of a family left behind
Everybody knows it’s time
Jelly Roll, one of a kind

[Chorus]
Bitch, I’m a zombie
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep
I’m killin’ everything in sight
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Bitch, I am a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
Only when it’s dark out
Only when it’s dark out
We move when it’s dark out
We live when it’s dark out
Bitch, I’m a zombie (Zombie, zombie)
I’m a product of the night
And I get no sleep (No sleep)
I’m ki-Embed
