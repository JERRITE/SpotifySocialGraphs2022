Rompela Lyrics ["Rompela" letter ft. One Six]

[Pre-car: Yandel & Will.i.am]
No one moves it as you know 'do
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '
Mommy, an equal like you out there is no
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '(oh-oh; let's go)

[Chorus: Yandel]
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (oh-o)
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
[Post-Coro: Yandel & Will.i.am]
'Toy pa' your return, tell what what
Tyme the ubi pa 'arrive from once'
Tell me if it is 'in pr or walk' in RD
Pa 'eat from once' and bass of once '(eh)

[Verse 1: Will.i.am]
She Got A Doll Face
Moves Likes to Leonesa
She Might Get Throned, Princess
Ey, Oh, Sexy, She let me sex her, Yeah
She Makes Me Feel Real Nice
Put a ring on her, Make Her My Wife
Be My Reina, Be My Queen For Life
Oh my, She Takes My Love All Night, Yeah

[Pre-car: Yandel]
No one moves it as you know 'do
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '
Mommy, an equal like you out there is no
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '(eh-eh)

[Chorus: Yandel & El Alfa]
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it; Yao)

Huh, yah (yah)
You ere 'the one who breaks it, the slit, turns on it and the amaja
I am the madman that you like, the one who triggers you
He likes the Brugal with the mint Halls
That puts me up 'the ring, like I'm hall
I have the hammer 'e Thor pa' send you Pa'l Doctor
I have a fantasy and 'e to do it' in the engine
Love breaks barrier '
Bank account, it dies 'If you cling to you'
Is that love breaks barrier '
Bank account, it dies 'If you cling to you'
Is that love breaks barrier '
Bank account, it dies 'If you cling to you'

[Verse 3: Yandel]
Move the boat and expose it, mom, breathe deep
You know I don't answer
Once the street is a 'e rondon
Yandel and Alfa, the business is round
MMM, what are you going to do? The album is groceries'
And you moving my ass so 'exploit'

[Chorus: Yandel & Will.i.am]
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
Let's go, eat on
[Pre-car: Yandel]
No one moves it as you know 'do (you know' do)
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '(eh)
Mami, an equal to you there is not seen (huh)
You do it 'like e'
You break it as e '(eh-eh)

[Chorus: Yandel]
You ere 'the one who breaks it, breaks it, breaks it, breaks it (breaks it)
