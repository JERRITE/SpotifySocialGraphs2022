Donâ€™t Stop the Devil LyricsHey you
Baby blues
Show me whatcha gonna do

Mad Jack
Dressed in black
Gonna give Mama a heart attack

Soul buyer
Spittin' fire
Only your touch gonna get me wild
Say I'm not a sinner
But you make me a liar
I like the games we play
When you're inside my veins
No a little good
Don't stop the Devil

If I go up in flames
Then just put me away
Cause a little good
Don't stop the Devil

Hellbent
Left again
Ain't comin' back til' god knows when

Oh yeah
I'll be damned
Gonna make a deal with the back door man

Soul buyer
Spittin' fire
Only your touch gonna get me wild
Never was a sinner
Til' you set me on fire

I like the games we play
When you're inside my veins
No a little good
Don't stop the Devil
You might also likeIf I go up in flames
Then just put me away
Cause a little good
Don't stop the Devil

Soul buyer
Spittin' fire
Only your touch gonna get me wild
Say I'm not a sinner
But you make me a liar

I like the games we play
When you're inside my veins
No a little good
Don't stop the Devil

If I go up in flames
Then just put me away
Cause a little good
Don't stop the DevilEmbed
