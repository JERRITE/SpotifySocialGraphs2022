Highway Star Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a wild hurricane
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

[Verse 2]
Nobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Ooh, she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth
Body control and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her
I need her
I see her

[Chorus]
Yeah, she turns me on
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody gonna steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Ooh, I'm in heaven again
I've got everything
Like a moving ground
An open road and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I seed it

[Chorus]
Eight cylinders, all mine
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything
[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I bleed it

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a mad hurricane
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star8Embed
