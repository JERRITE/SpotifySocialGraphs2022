Axl Rose LyricsWoah
Where did you go Axl Rose?

Angel lives alone in East Baltimore
Eviction notice stapled to her front door
Bleach-blond hair, fishnet pantyhose
God, she wishes it was 15 years ago
Buying her a drink meant anything you wanted that night was alright
But through cocaine tears and 15 years
You know she sleeps alone tonight
And screams
Whoa
Where did you go Axl Rose?
Whoa
Where did you go?
Oh, Axl...

Ricky lives alone, mother's basement
37, got nothing yet to show for it
Heavy metal man with his long hair
The top's gone but he's still rockin' the ponytail
All he's got now is post-grunge apathy
(catastrophe)
He says The Vines and The White Stripes
Just don't get it for me and my friends
Take me back then

Whoa
Where did you go Axl Rose?
Whoa
Where did you go (Axl Rose)

Till one night at karaoke
Ricky was kickin' out Bon Jovi
"Dead or Alive" I think it was
And right then, Angel fell in love
She knew they'd be together
Stuck in the past forever

She don't care she's stuck in the '80s
They don't care they're stuck in the '80s
We don't care we're stuck in the '80s

Whoa
Where did you
Go
Where did you
Go
Axl

Whoa
Where did you go Axl Rose? (Rose)
Whoa
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
He don't care he's stuck in the '80s
Where did you go?
She don't care she's stuck in the '80s
Where did you go?
We don't care we're stuck in the '80s
Oh, AxlEmbed
