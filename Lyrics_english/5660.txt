Moondust Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's nothing that I can do
Except bury my love for you

[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust
[Verse 2]
Nothing can breathe in the space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Drivin' through your sunset breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
But the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you

[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

[Verse 3]
I'm a castaway and then reap what they sow
And I say what I know to be true
Yeah I'm livin' far away on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you

[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust
I've buried my love in the moondust, yeahYou might also like28Embed
