Ever ever after - original version LyricsStorybook endings
Fairy tales coming true
Deep down inside
We wanna believe
They still do
And a secret is taught
It's our favorite part
Of the story
Let's just admit
We all wanna make it to
Ever ever after
If we just don't get it
Our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be
A wish away
Start a new fashion
Wear your heart
On your sleeve
Sometimes you reach
What's real
Just by making believe
On the fate
On a shame
There is joy
To be claimed
In this world
You might even wind up
Being glad to be you
Ever ever after
Though the world
Will tell you
It's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours
If you let your heart
Believe in ever after
No wonder your heart
Feels its flying
Your head feels
It's spinning
Each happy ending's
A brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted
You just might break
The rule to
Ever ever after
Forever could even
Start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just
One wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever ever ever after
Oh, oh, oh
Forever ever afterYou might also likeEmbed
