TranslationsDeutschSomething to Someone Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's lessons in love sometimes
The heart is but a winding road
So this story goes
I get scared of the dark and I
I never even noticed rooms
Were made bright by you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you loved me more than anyone
Yeah, we were up so high
We were lost when we were young, but
You were mine
[Chorus]
Once upon a time
You were by my sidе
I wish I could've known
That I should hold on tight
To every singlе word
To every summer night
I wish I could've known
That "forever" was a lie
But once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone
Once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone

[Verse 2]
See your shape under gold streetlights
But every time I'm close, you move
And I'm just left with the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you loved me more than anyone
Yeah, we were up so high
We were lost when we were young, but
You were mine

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could've known
That I should hold on tight
To every single word
To every summer night
I wish I could've known
That "forever" was a lie
But once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone
Once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Somethin' to you
Somethin' to you

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could've known
That I should hold on tight
To every single word
To every summer night
I wish I could've known
That "forever" was a lie
But once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone
Once upon a time
I was somethin' to someone

[Post-Chorus]
Somethin' to you
I was somethin' to someone (I was somethin')
Somethin' to you
I was somethin' to someone

[Outro]
