Sturdy30 Lyrics[Intro]
Aight, talk your shit
Yo, it's your fucking boy
Sturdy motherfuckin' Mr. 30
You fucking the streets up (Haha, yeah)
Fucking niggas' bitches
Fucking niggas' wives (Hahaha)
Yo, listen man, we ain't fucking around man
We taking this shit, man, to a whole 'nother fucking level man
We fucking coming with the same fucking energy man
All you lame ass niggas and lame ass bitches better tune the fuck in tonight (Hahahaha, no cap)
We fucking taking over the world
[Chorus]
Look, off the wake up, gotta kiss my bitch (Facts)
Then I take a piss
'Fore I leave the house, gotta grab the blick
Call up Sturdy 30, tell him that it's lit
Wanna live his life, gotta take a risk
All the stupid shit I did as a kid
Takin' niggas' phonеs, robbin' niggas' kicks
The ones who survived know I don't miss

[Verse]
Bando, I'm two for two from thе three
Caught a leg shot 'cause that boy speed
Nigga got me booked talking to the dees
Moving P's and Q's on my Q's and P's
How you gon' rap with a nigga like me?
How you gon' cap to a nigga like me?
Bitch I'm really outside with the killers and the thieves
We really in the jungle, niggas throwing up B's
Late night in the summer, we was throwing by the three
Niggas know where I be
Niggas always wanna talk, but they don't want beef (What?)
Where you at? We could meet
You know I don't kickbox (I don't kickbox)
Luva got a .30, got a 16, so really that's 46 shots
You know we making shit hot
Take a drum on a drill like we changing hip-hop
Bail out gang if he play with big knots
Brody get slimey like he a big snot
Before we go spin, let's make a pit stop (Get money)
They tried to tell a nigga change his flow (What?)
But nigga I made this shit, like
Boy I get paid for this shit (Facts)
Boy I got fame for this shit, uh
Spittin' that dangerous shit (Like)
'Cause we really out flamin' and shit
Tell them niggas don't play in this bitch (At all)
Hundred shots, no aiming and shit (Grah)
We made a name for this shit (Rah, rah rah)
I put the gang in this shit
You know what we claiming and shit
And I got the chain on my wrist
I got your bitch in the whip
Just off the brain, she a ten
She moan my name when I'm in
They like, "Yo Skizzy, you always on some treesh shit"
Nah, I'm where the breesh is
Boy think it's sweet, send rounds like it's Reeses
Hollows hit his heart, spread around in pieces
Talkin' like you God, send you up to Jesus
Put that on my nieces, mm (What?)
(Legs real, gave my niggas creases)
You might also like[Chorus]
Look, off the wake up, gotta kiss my bitch (Facts)
Then I take a piss
'Fore I leave the house, gotta grab the blick
Call up Sturdy 30, tell him that it's lit
Wanna live his life, gotta take a risk
All the stupid shit I did as a kid
Takin' niggas' phones, robbin' niggas' kicks
The ones who survived know I don't miss

[Outro]
'Cause that boy speed
On my Q's and P's, likeEmbed
