What Dreams Are Made Of Lyrics[Intro]
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see you smiling I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
I would never want to miss this
'Cause in my heart, I know what this is
[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of

[Interlude]
(Hey now)
This is what dreams are made of

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wondered what life is about?
You could search the world and never figure it out
You don't have to sail the oceans
No, no, no
Happiness is no mystery
It's here and now
It's you and me, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of

(Hey now)

[Bridge]
Open your eyes
(This is what dreams are made of)
Shout to the skies
(This is what dreams are made of)
When I see you smiling I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
Yesterday my life was duller
Now everything's technicolor

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong (belong)
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams, dreams
This is what dreams are made of

[Outro]
Hey now, hey now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
This is what dreams
Hey now, hey now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
This is what dreams  (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
