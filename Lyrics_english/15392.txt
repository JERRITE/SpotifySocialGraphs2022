It’s Depression LyricsFirst of all I'm out of my mind
You don't wanna touch me
You don't wanna call me and if you do then you've been taking your sweet time
I just wanna tell you
That I just wanna kiss you, uh

I'm not going home 'til it's all on the table
Gotta know if I've been thinking right
I don't wanna go I don't know how to say this
I don't wanna waste my time
Tell me that you want me back and I'll stop over thinking everything I do and all I say to you
It's not really what I had in mind!
All I want is someone to love and I don't know why I always fuck everything that I do and all I say to you
It's not really what I had in mind!

Sorry if I called you crying
It's depression
And I just miss you
Yeah, I can't sleep now
I'm not even trying to fight it
If I stay quiet
I’d be lying through my teeth now

I’m not going home 'til it's all on the table
Gotta know if I've been thinking right
I don't wanna go I don't know how to say this
I don't wanna waste my time

Tell me that you want me back and I'll stop ovеr thinking everything I do and all I say to you
It's not really what I had in mind!
All I want is somеone to love and I don't know why I always fuck everything that I do and all I say to you
It's not really what I had in mind

All I really wanted was someone to crave to try and forget everything
I faked for a little bit of sanity waking me up just don't stop

All I want is someone to love and I don't know why I always fuck everything that I do and all I say to you
It's not really what I had in mindEmbed
