Ouu Ahh Lyrics[Intro]
Yoz, what you tellin' me?
Step out in these streets, got these niggas big, big, big mad
Hit me a lick and go split with my niggas, just so I can show 'em I'm legit
She want her Chanel, when it's time for that bail, I bet you that ho won't give up shit (No she won't)
I was running in CVS's tryna get some blessings, then I go and cop a 'fit  (Mmh, mmh)
I got three words, it's gon' either be, "Let's get rich," or "Suck my dick" (Fuck 'em, bah)

[Chorus]
Step out in these streets, got these niggas big, big, big mad (Big, big, big mad)
I don't like how you moving, boy better get, get, get back (Get, get, get back)
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, no chit-chit-chit-chat (No words, bah)
Get money, get money, you know I'm all 'bout the racks (You know that I'm with it)
Ooh (Ooh), please don't take me out my mood
And please don't make me tell my nigga Shoov
He'll go off (He'll go)
I swear to God he'll prove to you he ain't soft (Ooh, ah)
[Verse]
I ain't with all the kissing, no, no, no
I ain't with all the telling, no, no, no
I'm fucking his bitch, he don't know
To fuck me, you gotta fuck Brycio
I ain't with all the stressin', I'ma get to flexin', I won't two step it, oh
She go to her nigga after we just fucked, he got sloppy seconds, oh
I was down in the streets, turned my heart cold, I ain't used to heat, ah
Put the four on my back, heard she want a rump, you know what I tell her, "Bye"
All the bad in my past, I done been through it
It's so sad how they mad I'm an influence
Get racks, get money, that's what I been doing (That's what I been doin')
Get racks, get money, you know I get to it

[Chorus]
Step out in these streets, got these niggas big, big, big mad (Got these niggas big, big, big mad)
I don't like how you moving, boy better get, get, get back
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, no chit-chit-chit-chat
Get money, get money, you know I'm all 'bout the racks (You know that I'm with it, you know that I'm 'bout it)
Ooh (Ooh), please don't take me out my mood
And please don't make me tell my nigga Shoov (Get him, baow, hit him)
He'll go off (He'll go off, nigga)
I swear to God he'll prove to you he ain't soft, yeah (He ain't soft at all, bah, bah)

[Outro]
I can't stand these hoes
Watch out for my G-Fazos (Watch out)
She want love, but I want O's (I don't want it, I want money)
Stack it up, add it up, run it up, do it, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You like how it taste? Haha
Big, big, big mad
That's how you finish this shitYou might also likeEmbed
