원하는 게 얼굴에 보여
I'm trouble and you're wa-wa-wanting it
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Thutmose]
Movin' too fast, life is movin' in slow-mo
I'm a god, better ask if you don't know
Homie, better put your pride aside (Aside)
I'm a Benz and you're more like a Volvo
Your best stuff looks like my worst, synapses fire and burst
Got the whole crew with me, 'bout to deal damage
You know we ain't average (Oh yeah)
I ain't gonna say this again
But this is my time, better look in my eyes
I'm a genius in disguise, wear my heart on my sleeve
And you forced to oblige to a king in his prime (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody get in line, sit back, watch the stars align
I finesse like my life on the line
Was a diamond in the rough and now I shine (Woo)
[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
Ay, no one can stop us, they'll try, but they won't
Ay, nada nos puede parar, oh, no

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'
We're livin' like giants, yeah, giants
We're bigger than giants, we're giants, oh

[Post-Chorus: Becky G]
Sleepin' giants, sleepin', sleepin' giants (Yah)

[Verse 2: Becky G & Soyeon]
Shuttin' it down, been underground
Now my people all up in this place (Place)
Spinnin' this thing, gold on my ring, royalty up in my veins (Veins)
I'm loco, think I'm so cold, I stay stuntin', ain't no goin' back
Now they ask where QiQi's at, I'm like you can't hang with that
쏟아져 빛이 멀게 돼 눈이
멈추진 않아 once we go
날카로운 날로 뭐든 베어
빨리 달려 넌! 못.따.라. 와~
True Damage, we do it, True Damage 보여줄게 뭐든 쉽게
이기든지든, my crew make the beat drop

We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'

We're bigger than giants (Yeah), we're giants
You thought that we were weak, but we comin' right back (Right back)
This time, you're gonna see how we do it like that (Yeah)
We're livin' like giants, yeah, giants (Yeah)
We're bigger than giants, we're giants, oh

Sleepin' giants, sleepin', sleepin' giants

[Verse 3: DUCKWRTH, Soyeon & Keke Palmer]
Mm, I keep on shattering time
I might just leave you behind
Homie, you stuck on rewind (Yeah, yeah, yuh)
You should quit sleepin' on mines (Woo)
You got your back on recline
When I damage your delicate spine
Please don't act all shy and surprised (누구)
They be like (뭐), they be like
What you mean? (Uh) What is your winning scheme? (Woo)
I got a giant team (That's what?), big as my self esteem (Big)
Run it back, run it back, runnin' man (Run it)
They think they go hard, I'm like come again (Sheesh)
You run out of time when I'm bustin' in, while you stumblin'
I got this blade in my hand for your punishment (Oh, woo)
[Chorus: Keke Palmer, Becky G, Both & Thutmose]
We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
We're runnin' this world, we're keepin' it turnin'
We're livin' like giants (Giants), yeah, giants (Yeah)
We're bigger than giants (Woo), we're giants (Yeah)
You thought that we were weak, but we comin' right back (Right back)
This time, you're gonna see how we do it like that (Yeah)
We're livin' like giants (Giants), yeah, giants (Hey)
We're bigger than giants (Hey), we're giants, oh
