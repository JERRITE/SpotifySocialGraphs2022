[Intro: sech, wisin, zion & sech]
Hi (The Avengers)
I want to know your name and maybe, maybe (other musical levels; maybe)
We could have something, I don't know (I don't know)
If you thought to me (ah-ah), as I thought you (I thought; the avengers)
It was that I remembered, that yesterday (yesterday), you, uh-uh

[Pre-car: Feid, Wisin]
You left in my bed to your underwear (Yeah, Yeah)
And today I am looking for you to pass it by bastard
I don't know what you have, the shorty is hard
MODELA IN ITS STORY (EH-EH-EH; LET'S GO)
[Chorus: Dalex, Zion & Dalex, Zion, Wisin]
Yesterday night I started 'and the album turned on' and you turned on '(tra)
Last night I did it 'in the car and today I didn't even know me'
How rich you did, baby (z-diddy; ah)
Yesterday night I started 'and the album turned on' and you turned on '(tra)
Last night I did it 'in the car and today I didn't even know me'
How rich he did ', baby

[Verse 1: Justin Quiles]
We 'making it attrae' and it seats it 'pa'lante
Stick behind the wheel (Yeh-Yeh-Yeh)
Kissing my neck, he tells me he wants me to put reggaeton suede '
Triple equi ', eh (yeah), when I climb it (tra)
He has you thinking about how I whipped you
You call me ', and I get home in Fedex

[Verse 2: zion]
Yo-yo-, I have a cat that I like
He is half a masochist and likes to detail ', -tr치' (tra)
I always drink with me, but when he sees she likes to smoke (Z-Diddy; You Know)
When I put it (hard), the capsulon is formed to the ceiling (the ceiling)
I want it because it's a new booty (new booty)
I don't need another, Baby, that's why
Zion, baby!

[Choir: Lenny Tav치rez, Dalex, Zion & Dalex, Wisin, *Zion *]
Yesterday night I started 'and the album turned on' and you turned on '(tra)

How rich you did, baby (*z-diddy*; ah)
Yesterday night I started 'and the album turned on' and you turned on '(tra)
Last night I did it 'in the car and today I didn't even know me'
How rich I did ', *baby *

Yeah
They gave the twelve (OH), and between caresses and friction
I did what I wanted just for you to enjoy
I am your slave (slave), tell me, what do I do? (What I do?)
But please, don't say you don't recognize me
Because it was magical (it was magical), eating your exotic body (exotic)
I was sick of love and you were my antibiotic
I bit your lips, you said "Give me" (you said "Give me")
That will take you to heaven and that the moment does not end (delay it-protect it)

[Verse 4: Lenny Tav치rez]
Shorty, how are you doing? (How's it going?)
The perfume of your body does not leave (I do not leave)
The crystallic 'tarnishes for the wetland' (wuh)
And the 'condoms in the drawer in case, if it occurs, da
You are addicted to perreo, but more to the Bellaqueo (-will)
69 positions and we looked '(no' vamo ')
I have 'a vice that the two queremo' (Queremo ') always

[Verse 5: feid]
Another, another night, another
I carry a bartica pa 'pledge, ma'
Another, another night, another
With that ass juy, Yeah
Parce, you have to move (-se, -se)
Today I took the 'Jordan and La Merce (-CE)
Baby, what else then? What is pa 'to do this afternoon? (Afternoon)
I went through the neighborhood before coming to see you (Yeah)
[Chorus: Dalex, Sech, Wisin]
Yesterday night I started 'and the album turned on' and you turned on '(tra)
Last night I did it 'in the car and today I didn't even know me'
How rich you did, baby (ah)
Yesterday night I started 'and the album lit' and you 'tasted' (tra)
Yesterday I started 'In the car, today I didn't know me'
How rich you did
