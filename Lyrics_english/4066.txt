They painted you Lyrics (letter of "You painted little birds" ft. Andy Rivera]

[Pre-car]
What happened with the one who said he loved you?
Has he left and has left you excited? (Tell it, Andy)
Do not crash to know that you are alone
I told you that they were going to pay you with the same currency

[Chorus]
They painted you in the air
They swore false love and you believed it
Her promises keep in the air
You are feeling what you made one day
They painted you in the air
They swore false love and you believed it
Her promises keep in the air
You are feeling what you made one day
[Verse 1]
Although Nena hurts you, I am glad
They painted a white landscape and it came out of black
You deserve it, in relationships it is time to suffer sometimes
Just as I suffered for you one and so many times (you deserve it)
You deserve it in relationships to suffer sometimes
Just as I suffered for you one and so many times (you deserve it)

[Chorus]
They painted you in the air
They swore false love and you believed it
Her promises keep in the air
You are feeling what you made one day

[Verse 2]
He who pays it and you are paying it
There I find out that you are having a very bad time
Because the person you love is deceiving you
And that hurts you, is killing you

[Pre-car]
What happened with the one who said he loved you?
Has he left and has left you excited?
Do not crash to know that you are alone
I told you that they were going to pay you with the same currency

And although I know that this is causing you pain
I hope you feel what my heart felt one day

[Chorus]
They painted you in the air
They swore false love and you believed it
Her promises keep in the air
You are feeling what you made one day
They painted you in the air
They swore false love and you believed it
Her promises keep in the air
You are feeling what you made one day
