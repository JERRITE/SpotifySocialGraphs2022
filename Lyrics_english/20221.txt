What to Expect Lyrics[hook]
Bike is loud off the grip Grizzy love to drag it out
Bitch im wild what the fuck think you know you talking bout
Pop a top, pop a watts, pop a wheelie when I'm out
Pop a bean,  pop a Glock, and you know thats hollow rounds

[Chorus]
Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Lookin at me on my phone
Tellin me what to expect
Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Tellin me what to expect
Tellin me what to expect
[verse 1]
Whitney come down with the weed I'm feeling lifted
Blow through the green in my garden like a trimmer
Sip slow potion watch me whipping in the bimmer
And I'm soft with the lotion just one night is what the hoping

[Chorus]
Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Lookin at me on my phone
Tellin me what to expect
Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Lookin at me on my phone
Tellin me what to expect

[verse 2]
I drive a black tahoe truck sip a double cup
Gotta hit another blonde before we in the club
So we hit a little party in the hills
And I'm driving really fast and I'm trying spin the wheels
In the back burning blacks on the black top how i peel out
While I'm riding round town
And i gotta pretty little thing know she down
On to it yeah
Load the clip

Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Lookin at me on my phone
Tellin me what to expect
Juggin finessin and flex
Devil was callin me next
Lookin at me on my phone
Tellin me what to expect
