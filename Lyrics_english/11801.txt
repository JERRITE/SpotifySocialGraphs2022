Waiting for the Lyrics Bus [lyrics by "waiting for the bus"]

[Intro]
"Go, what is this not my woman?"
–Papi, five thousand and the piece
"Ah, beast!"

[Verse 1]
I was shopping at the center walking when suddenly
It was that I caught you
Very painted and very bad stop by Veracruz, near a coffee
When you saw me you set engines and you were going from that fly
You never believed that I was going to find you with skirt and heels out there bad stop
Pure Chepa was that I realized what was the company in which you worked
This is the memory of a while Maluco touring streets there through Medellín
I found a block full of fugas when my wife
I also saw her there
[Chorus]
Quiubo then, mija, and what do you do there so badly?
Is it where you worked?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Huh, I don't believe you
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
That keychain in the hands and that wig what?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
And that 'breasts outside what?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Look how you are stirring
As far as I understand
The bus that travels for Manrique has never passed by Veracruz

[Interlude]
"Yes, but when I gave you those expensive chains you didn't say anything
–And what I was going to know about 'that came that
Gózalo, Jericho

[Verse 2]
You were very pretty, a beautiful sardine when I found you
With you I got married
But mere gurre you were putting on and I all healthy without knowing why
I asked you why you are so skinny, see that nothing has missed you here
I like a fool of merchandise in the house and she was another food on the street
Pure Chepa was that I realized what was the company in which you worked
This is the memory of a while Maluco touring streets there through Medellín
I found a block full of fugas when my wife
I also saw her there

Quiubo then, mija, and what do you do there so badly?
Is it where you worked?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Huh, I don't believe you
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
And so flash?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
And those penicillins what?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Look how you are stirring
As far as I understand
The bus that travels for Manrique has never passed by Veracruz

[Outro]
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Rightly was that you didn't want to do anything with me
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Unhappy!
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
And that smell of fish what?
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
What a silver hiper
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
Rightly it was that you came without hunger for the house
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the bus
And one like a fool here waiting for her
Waiting for the bus, waiting for the Busbed
