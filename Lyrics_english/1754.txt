Unusual-Self Lyrics[Chorus]
I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you
I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you (you, you, you, you)

[Verse 1]
Baby
I just bought a new cadillac
Did you see me in it? (see)
That this is brand new
To try to get you
I'm spending (spending, spending)
Money that I don't have (yeah)
Buying all the finer things
To grab your attention
Look what I do to get you
[Pre-Chorus]
Doing things I never do
This is so unusual
Losing my mind again
It started now it doesn't end

[Chorus]
I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you
I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you (you, you, you, you)

[Verse 2]
Baby
I just bought a new outfit (yes I did)
I hope you see me in it (see, see)
That I wanna look my best baby
Just for you
And I'm buying, buying (buying, buying)
Materials I don't need
I don't know why
Maybe if I got the diamonds
You will see me shining
Yes you would

[Pre-Chorus]
Doing things I never do (I never do)
This is so unusual (unusual)
Losing my mind again (my mind again)
It started now it doesn't end

I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you
I really want you bad, I do
Doing so much things I'd never do, for you (you, you, you, you)
(you, you, you, you)2Embed
