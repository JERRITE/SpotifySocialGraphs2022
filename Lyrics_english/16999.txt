Welcome to the Real World LyricsI'm cryin' tears of joy
I'm cryin' tears of pain
I'm cryin' tears of joy
They run down my face into a river that winds its way into your life

Welcome little one
To this place of earth and stone
Welcome little one
All blue eyes and innocence
The world is so much colder than your own soft glance
[Chorus]
Hey, it's a human race
Hey, it's a brave new place
Hey, now you're at the gate
Welcome to the real world
There's so much to learn
Welcome to the real world
Welcome to the real world
There's so much to learn
Welcome to the real world

The past is a memory
The chains that were choking me
I'm cryin' tears of pain
I'm cryin' tears of joy
I see my freedom lying in my arms tonight

[Chorus]
Hey, it's a human race
Hey, it's a brave new place
Hey, now you're at the gate
Welcome to the real world
There's so much to learn
Welcome to the real world
Welcome to the real world
There's so much to learn
Welcome to the real world

(Solo)

Welcome to the, welcome to the (There's so much to learn)
Welcome to the (Welcome to the real world) welcome, welcome
