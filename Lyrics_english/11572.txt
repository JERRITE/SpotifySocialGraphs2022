Big Wheel Lyrics[Intro]
I got bug bites on my legs
I got two friends who look alike
I got coffee in the morning
And my mama in the night

[Chorus]
And I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got bad news but I didn’t fight

[Verse 1]
I got a big wheel in Montana
And he told me yesterday
That a year ago he looked me in the eyes
And lied to me
Got an old friend in Japan
She's been mad at me before
It's just that she and I have got
Nothing in common anymore
He feels bad for doing what he did that night
She bought new shoes in Tokyo
[Chorus]
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I got bad news but I didn't fight

[Verse 2]
I got a lover in my bedroom
Or the smell of him at least
If he's somewhere getting smarter
On a free man's odyssey
God, I'm really gonna blow
With all this empathetic shit
I understand the thing you did
And every reason you did it
But I'm so mad dude
And I wanna cry
I got bad news but I didn't fight

[Bridge]
I got bug bites on my legs
I got a big wheel in Montana
Got an old friend in Japan
Got a lover in my bedroom

[Chorus]
And I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I got bad news but I didn't fightYou might also like2Embed
