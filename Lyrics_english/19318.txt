[Verse 1]
She got that goose, yeah, with the real fur

Too cold, icy wrist, lean got me movin' slow
She need me, ice be in her drink, she hit the North Pole
Spend my cash, make it back, when you need, I got you smoke
Yeah, baby from the North, your heart is stone cold
You can hit me up anytime you want
For the drugs or the love, you can have it all
I'm cold to the touch, you're bad to the bone
