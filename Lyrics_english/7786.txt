TranslationsPortuguêsHair Down Lyrics[Verse 1: SiR]
I been goin' silly for the Westside (Westside)
You might catch me rollin' where the reps ride (Real reps, real reps, real reps)
Ain't no opposition, I'm the best, right? (Yeah, yeah)
I might take my city on a test drive (Test drive)
You don't wanna see me on a good day (Oh no, oh no)
You don't wanna see me on a bad day (No, no, no, oh no)
I was just a nigga with some hoop dreams (Hoop dreams)
Now, I'm in the league, bitch
Now, I'm in the lead, bitch
I can slam dunk but I just layup (I just layup, ayy)
Smokin' marijuana 'til I, ooh (Ooh), what? (What?) wake up
May not understand me 'cause it's all real (I'm all real, all real)
And I don't really give a damn how y'all feel (No, no)
[Chorus: SiR]
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Everybody's watchin', I'm aware now (I'm aware now)
But I can't find a reason I should care now (I should care now)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my–

[Post-Chorus: SiR]
If I take off my cool, do you promise to stay?
If I give you my heart, would you throw it away?
Do you mean what you say when you tell me you love me?
Do you really?
Do you really?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Itty-bitty bitch is a numerologist
Got your number where I live
I'ma get you outta pocket like a quarterback blitz
That's a everyday faucet, make it wet, make it rinse
Skeletons in your closet but your past don't exist
Got a pad on your list, got a pad on your lock
Calabas' ain't the move, that's where everybody live
Plus the mountain is hot, you forgot what you got, ah!
Hol' up, nuisance (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend 'em all with acoustics (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend a bed for the juices (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend you live where the truth is (I say it, I say it, I say it)
Psychedelic views and infinity pools, yeah, checking out
Once I sweat them edges out
Hair down like vanity
I got the fuck-ups, I got the damage fees
I got the gold dust, I got the anesthesia
When you chose up, this ain't a fantasy
We 'bout to go up, see underhanding me never got no love
But understandin' me maybe can mold us and–
