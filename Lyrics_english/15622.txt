Metal heart Lyrics [metal heart letter "]

[Bridge 1]
If you think I have metal heart
You are wrong, your absence makes me bad
If you think I have a stone heart
Do not confuse, I am not that way

[Pre-car]
You can see me hesitating
But inside I am crying
I want to see you again
And in my bed you have
You can see me hesitating
But inside I am crying
I want to see you again, see you again
[Chorus]
How the hell do you do to live without me?
How hell do I do if you are not here?
How the hell do you do to live without me?
How hell do I do if you are not here?

[Post-car]
Do you not need my kisses in the morning?
Do you not need to make love to you?
Do you not need my kisses in the morning?
Do you not need to make love to you?

[Verse 1]
(Joey)
I have tried other lips but nevertheless
They are not like yours, they know me bitter '
How do I take the penalty I charge?
I enter the party and then I long
Because all the songs tell me about you
I take a couple of drink 'and I only think of you
I bet you feel the same without me
Angelina is not the same if not Brad Pitt, Hey (Hey)

[Bridge 2]
And this loneliness
It is killing me
I miss you so much, Baby (AH-AH-AH-AH)
This loneliness
It is killing me
(Explain me, baby)

[Bridge 1]
If you think I have metal heart
You are wrong, your absence makes me bad
If you think I have a stone heart
Do not confuse, I am not that way

[Pre-car]
You can see me hesitating
But inside I am crying
I want to see you again
And in my bed you have
You can see me hesitating
But inside I am crying
I want to see you again, see you again

[Chorus]
How the hell do you do to live without me?
How hell do I do if you are not here?
How the hell do you do to live without me?
How hell do I do if you are not here?
