Broken dreams Lyrics [Lyrics for "Broken Dreams"]

[Verse 1]
That dead rose on the street waiting
Message after message preparing to fly
Because it had been my partner
Because you are nothing and now everything is about

[Pre-car]
If I didn't kill you, it wasn't for you
I don't believe in love and it's not for me
If I didn't know you and I lost you
If every day you give me it makes you suffer
No, oh
[Chorus]
Re -see you again
With the eyes soaked in yesterday
With the sweetness of a love that nobody sees
With the promise of that last coffee
With a lot of broken dreams
Re -see you again
Re -see you again
With a lot of broken dreams

[Verse 2]
I left the pride behind for a moment
I prepared to be alone once again

[Pre-car]
If I didn't kill you, it wasn't for you
I don't believe in love and it's not for me
If I did not understand and lost you
If every day you give me it makes you suffer
No, oh

[Choir] [x2]
Re -see you again
With the eyes soaked in yesterday
With the sweetness of a love that nobody sees
With the promise of that last coffee
With a lot of broken dreams
Re -see you again
Re -see you again
With a lot of broken dreams might also like1embed
