Shaky in the Knees Lyrics[Intro]
She shakes me like a tambourine
Rattling my knees, rattling my knees
She sinks me like a submarine
Deep beneath the sea, deep beneath the sea

[Verse]
I'm no stranger to the dark side of my mind
If I fall off again would you catch me one more time?
Would you love me right if I put it all on the line?
Would you lift me up if I could leave my glitches behind?
[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't leave me lonely
If it's real love, it's a misfit

[Chorus]
My heart was a witness to a love I can't unsee
I swear I didn't recognize this man they said was me
To love is my weakness, shake me baby, please
Shake it right out of me, 'til I'm shaking in the knee

[Post-Chorus]
She shakes me like a tambourine
Rattling my knees, rattling my knees
She sinks me like a submarine
Deep beneath the sea, deep beneath the sea

[Bridge]
Please go easy on me
Well, I'm shaking, shaking in my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't leave me lonely
If it's real love, it's a misfit

[Chorus]
My heart was a witness to a love I can't unsee
I swear I didn't recognize this man they said was me
To love is my weakness, shake me baby, please
Shake it right out of me, 'til I'm shaking in the knee

She shakes me like a tambourine
Rattling my knees, rattling my knees
She sinks me like a submarine
Deep beneath the sea, deep beneath the seaEmbed
