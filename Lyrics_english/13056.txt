TranslationsEspañolTürkçe​i don’t want to ask your father or anything Lyrics[Verse 1]
This foggy line, this misty morning
This railroad sign keeps me falling
I sleep outside even if it's raining
It's a sign, I'm leaving in the morning

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
Somebody left all mighty, my good friend
Reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
Somebody left all mighty, my good friend
Reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
[Verse 2]
That cancer mind, that old bats carpet
To realize​ what I am marking
And some old eyes that I am watching

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
Somebody left all mighty, my good friend
Reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
I don't wanna ask your father or anything

[Outro]
I don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
Somebody left all mighty, my good friend
Reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna talk, you lost me yet again
Somebody left all mighty, my good friend
Reptile mind, the good thrilled parted game
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anything
I don't wanna ask your father or anythingYou might also like3Embed
