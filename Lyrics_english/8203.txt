Regardless Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now you got me up like
I hate wakin' up alone
Call me when you're headin' home
I got things I need to say that I can't say to you over the telephone
Four, five glasses all alone
Boys and girls just come and go
I haven't seen you for a minute
I don't like it, not at all
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, one thing that I know
Is as hard as I try
I can't face the thought of you not being in my life
Regardless

[Chorus]
Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but nevеr say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whethеr we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
No, this house is not a home
When I'm sleepin' all alone
Used of havin', I'm on hold
And I can't touch you through the phone
You know when you turn me cold
I still got your t-shirt on, oh
Haven't seen you for a minute
I don't like it, not at all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, one thing that I know
Is as hard as I try
I can't face the thought of you not being in my life
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but never say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whether we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, why would you wanna make a girl, make a girl go so crazy?
The things that you do to me, ooh, it's as if you don't rate me, ah
Baby, don't play me, ah
This ain't no game to me, ah
[Chorus]
Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but never say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whether we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Oh, regard—, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-laEmbed
