I Just Canâ€™t Give You Up LyricsGot a message here that I hope you'll understand
When I met you keepin' my distance was the plan
But hey, I never thought you'd get to me this way
I got you - and that's good

I was so scared that I would fall for you at first
Holding back with my love just trying to gain your trust
But now I'm not ashamed to say that
You've got my love in your pocket
And I'm hooked - can't you see
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you n my blood

I got to let you know that you really
Got a hold on me
I'm hooked can't you see

I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you n my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my bloodYou might also likeEmbed
