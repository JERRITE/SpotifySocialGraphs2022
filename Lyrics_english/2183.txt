All the Boys Want Lyrics[Verse 1]
You pull up outside with your hot headlights
And you're walking up the stairs with a girl on each side
Go in the door like a thunderstorm go and
Crash boom boom with the lights on the dance floor

[Pre Chorus 1]
We get down, we get down, we got down
We get down, we get down, we got down

[Chorus]
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
[Verse 2]
Taking her time 'cause he's on the chase
So she's stringing him along
And she's getting in his head space

[Verse 3]
Clinical form with their jaws on the floor
And the girls keep score
While the boy's in back burn

[Pre Chorus 2]
So cool down, cool down, just cool down
We get down, we get down, we get down

[Chorus]
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys

[Post Chorus]
And all the boys want someone to let them go
Well all the boys want someone to let them go
All the boys want, all the boys want

[Bridge]
Scientific in my brain
Feeling dance inside my veins
Twist me like a hurricane
Numb you up like Novocaine
You might also likeScientific in my brain
Feeling dance inside my veins
Twist me like a hurricane
Numb you up like Novocaine

[Chorus]
All the girls want boys, boys
And all the boys want someone to let them go
All the girls want boys, boys

[Outro]
And all the boys want someone to let them go
Well all the boys want someone to let them go
All the boys want, all the boys wantEmbed
