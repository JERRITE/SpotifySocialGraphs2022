You would have gone before Lyricsno there is perfect love
I begin to think that this of love is a fantasy
I still don't think you no longer remember all the times I made you mine
And you still demand me
Forget your smile and delete all your caresses from my mind
You climb me to heaven and then fall to the ground
Why do you go when I loved you the most
You had gone before
Why didn't you leave when you weren't so indispensable yet
You ask me to forget when you did everything to fall in love with what you were playing, telling me why the devils forced me to love and then moved away
You had gone before
I don't think you are worthy that my heart
Strips in the trash
It sounds so ilogical that now you say it wasn't your fault
If I was not interisted that you kissed me with such a dulse and with such tenderness
You would have gone before and like this
I would no longer have this desire to beg you
And you still demand me
Forget your smile and delete all your caresses from my mind
You climb me to heaven and then fall to the ground
Why do you go when I loved you the most
You had gone before
Why didn't you leave when you weren't so indispensable yet
You ask me to forget when you did everything to fall in love with what you were playing, telling me why the devils forced me to love and then moved away
You had gone before
I don't think you are worthy that my heart
Strips in the trash
It sounds so ilogical that now you say it wasn't your fault
If I was not interisted that you kissed me with such a dulse and with such tenderness
You would have gone before and so I would not have this desire to beg Might Also Likeembed
