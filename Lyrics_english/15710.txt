Lyrics blue ["blue" letter]] 

 [Verse 1] 
 You, how to hold on, you 
 You, who orbits me like the sun 
 You, attached to the wall 
 You, that you inhabit my mind, you 
 You, in every corner, you 
 You, under the tablecloth 

 [Chorus] 
 I am falling apart for your absence 
 And the worst thing is that I never want to see you 
 I'm sinking into the habit of loving you 
 And you already forgot 
 [Verse 2] 
 YOUR LOOK ON THE RETIVELOR 
 You, with the blue dress 
 You, crying on the platform 

 [Chorus] 
 I am falling apart for your absence 
 And the worst thing is that I never want to see you 
 I'm sinking into the habit of loving you 
 And you already have another 

 [Saying] 
 You have another 
 You already have another 
 You forgot me, ah 
 You forgot me, uh 
 You already forgot me 

 [Musical Bridge] 

 [Chorus] 
 I am falling apart for your absence 
 And the worst thing is that I never want to see you 
 I'm sinking into the habit of loving you 
 And you already forgot 
 You Might Also Like [Outro] 
 You already forgot me 
 You already have another8embed
