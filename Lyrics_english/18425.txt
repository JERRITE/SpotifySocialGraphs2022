Like Itâ€™s Her Birthday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight I kinda get the feeling my girl is up to something
Something that is no good
She said she only had a meeting but she is dressed for something
Something that is no good
Now I'm not saying that she's cheating, but seeing is believing
Can't believe it what I'm seeing when I stepped inside

[Chorus]
She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday
[Verse 2]
She turns and says don't be surprised, it's going to be a good night
A good, good night
She's showing me a different side, one I've never seen before
That I ignore
Cause when I'm up she's all about me
When I'm down she stays around me
Now I know I'm one and only
So I might as well enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday
Like it's her birthday

She's so wasted, acting crazy
Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthdayEmbed
