Barbados Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, don't ever give away what's mine
Still masked up on them rides, yeah
Been in this whip for hours, I don't even know the time
And if she wants Chanel, she'll whine
Yeah, she love it when I'm deep inside her
In too deep in the violence
OTG known for firearms
And I'ma fly her out if I like her

[Verse 1]
And I'ma fly her out to Barbados
She find it crazy that I always got a stainless
Baby girl, why you think my top is stainless?
Walalo got it too, no, they ain't gon' stain shit
Take the wrong turn, get wigged
And she don't be impressed by no paper
How she look the same with no makeup?
[Chorus]
Yeah, don't ever give away what's mine
Still masked up on them rides, yeah
Been in this whip for hours, I don't even know the time
And if she wants Chanel, she'll whine
Yeah, she love it when I'm deep inside her
In too deep in the violence
OTG known for firearms
And I'ma fly her out if I like her

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh
If I like her
Uh, uh
And I'ma fly her out if I like her
And I'ma fly her out
And I be on the block, but I'm tryna make it out, yeah
Still keep theâ€” in my trousers
And I might even bring her to my house, yeah
And I be on the block with some demons
Pull up on a nigga, then leave him sleepin'
And I be on the block, so we ain't really speakin'
Uh, she don't even know how I'm feelin'
She don't even know that we schemin'
But it's all about you tonight
And I been with the G's, them handlin'
All day, so it's all about you tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, don't ever give away what's mine
Still masked up on them rides, yeah
Been in this whip for hours, I don't even know the time
And if she wants Chanel, she'll whine
Yeah, she love it when I'm deep inside her
In too deep in the violence
OTG known for firearms
And I'ma fly her out if I like herEmbed
