I Donâ€™t Wanna Lose You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and your job is responses
Having played the mating game
She doesn't waste time 'cause
All that she wants is
Real and honest devotion
Want here can't help her show
Though I hardly know your name
I know about love and I know
[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love

[Verse]
Women who have made mistakes are a little afraid
They don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed by those madly amasses
I know I've only just met you
Baby, I should know better
But when you look at me that way
There's something inside that's so right

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love

Tell me you're real
You're not pretending
Let's make a deal
'Cause my heart's depending on you
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always want to feel this way
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love2Embed
