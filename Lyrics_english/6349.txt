Can’t Be Alone Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
We were meant to die
We were suicide
You and I
There's bitter in your sweetest
Dirty white little lies
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
We give, we take
We all imitate
We come, we fake
We love ’til we hate
We give, we take
We all imitate
We come, we fake
We break
[Chorus]
Tell me you'll stay
Whatever it takes
Can't be alone tonight
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Love’s a mistake
Everything breaks
Can't be alone tonight
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)

I can't be alone tonight
I can't be alone
I can't be alone tonight

[Verse 2]
How we meant to know
Nothing's set in stone
Flesh and bone
Lovers come and go
But we cut the tie
Bleed it dry (Oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
We give, we take
We all imitate
We come, we fake
We love 'til we hate
We give, we take
We all imitate
We come, we fake
We break
You might also like[Chorus]
Tell me you'll stay
Whatever it takes
Can’t be alone tonight
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Love’s a mistake
Everything breaks
Can't be alone tonight
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)

I can’t be alone tonight

[Bridge]
Say you'll stay
Crowd my grave
Say you'll stay
Crowd my grave

Don't turn away
Whatever it takes
Can’t be alone tonight
Love's a mistake
Everything breaks
Can't be alone tonight

[Chorus/Outro]
I can't be alone tonight
We give, we take, we all imitate
I can't be alone
(We come, we fake, we love 'til we hate)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
I can't be alone tonight
(We give, we take, we all imitate)
I can't be alone
(We come, we fake, we break)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
I can't be alone tonight
(Say you'll stay)
(We give, we take, we all imitate)
I can't be alone
(Crowd my grave)
(Love 'til we hate)
I can't be alone tonight
(Say you'll stay)
(We give, we take, we all imitate)
I can't be alone
(Crowd my grave)
(We come, we fake, we break)Embed
