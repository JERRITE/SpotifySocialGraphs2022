Silent Words LyricsBeyond the lines of no man's land
Time stands still
My voice is weak, but far away, I softly speak
In silent words, on folded knees

With silent words we call the night
To bring you sleep & dry your eyes
To bring you dreams & free your minds
When every hope has gone, we hold on
With silent words we'll ask the dawn
To chase your fears when nights are long
A million voices in to one
When every hope has gone
We echo all night through
With silent words we are with you
With every tear you cry, we'll comfort you
Standing by your side, as one with you
You can find us, deep in the silence
Carried in the soft winds passing through
We'll be your shadow, today and tomorrow
There to follow everything you do
