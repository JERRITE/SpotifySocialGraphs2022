Lyricsal pass through
I follow your steps, I want to reach you
To ask you to be with me

And I regal your love

When passing
I look for your mouth, I want to kiss her
To feel around me
And give you a little of my love
Look at me
Don't be afraid, let yourself be loved
I just want your heat, woman
And what you can offer

How to tell you that I die, for you
How to ask you to be here
What just a kiss from you I want to feel
To be able to survive

When passing
I feel your magic and put me to tremble
I close my eyes and I feel your walk
That does not let me breathe

Unintentionally
I lose control, if I can't see you
When I don't sleep I feel crazy
I can't contain myself anymore

I do not can!

How to tell you that I die, for you
How to ask you to be here
What just a kiss from you I want to feel
To be able to survive
You might also like to pass
I follow your steps, I want to reach you
To ask you to be with me
And I regal your love

Yes, I want, do you want! If you want?

Unintentionally
I lose control, if I can't see you
When I do not sleep, I feel crazy
I can't contain myself anymore

When passing
I look for your mouth, I want to kiss her
To feel around me
And give you a little of my love

Look at me
Don't be afraid, let yourself be loved
I just want your heat, woman
And what you can offer

(Ready to finish?)

When passing
(Eggs!) Embed
