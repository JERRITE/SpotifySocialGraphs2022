[Verse 1: Alex Rose & Lenny Tavárez]
I already know you, I see it on your face
Do not behave, with me you can be bad
I will be yours for tonight
You will let go before the belt unbalanced (Woh!)
Tell me what positions you want '(Hey!)
I know he has 'boyfriend, but he prefers me'
I will be yours for tonight (Wuh!)
[Chorus: Lenny Tavárez]
Prepare, baby, because today I want to eat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and picheo all
Like you none, you win 'all
Therefore, baby, I want to eat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and picheo all
He has you dry, I get all, I get all, baby

[Verse 2: Alex Rose]
To 'the world loves you because as you none
And I took you to you to you 'and I under the moon (hey!)
There are many women
Life is just one
And just tell me that I do put it on one (ah)
Babecita, just warn (just warn)
Pa 'upload the crystals
Turn on and take off my shirt (Woh!)
I want you to be my submissive (submissive)
If you want to have your time, calm, I'm not in a hurry
That the night is young
And the jevo of yours does not realize
That bastard is Feka, it doesn't have what appears, Yeh
You are a lot of pa 'he (Woh!), That is what they comment

(Lenny Tavárez, Baby, EH-EH)
I don't know if we love each other (we love each other)
You are with him, but we have seen each other for a long time (Wuh!)
Whenever I am 'alone, Bellaqueamo' and we eat
With me, your vení'as go to the extreme
And that bastard with that movie (Brrra)
You don't leave with him, you feel ridiculous (ridiculous)
You prefer to stay alone in the house to call me
And I put to look for when you need me
Send me a Snapchat of that '(-so')
A selfie throwing me kiss '(-so')
I am on my way to lower the cheese (the cheese)
When I crossed the line I was wrong
If they discover you, say that I caused you

[Chorus: Alex Rose & Lyanno]
Because today I want to eat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and 'picheo all'
As you none, you beat 'all'
Therefore, baby, I want to eat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and 'picheo all'
You tell me, baby, and we look 'all' (SH-sh)
Pa 'eat all, Yeh
[Verse 4: Lyanno]
LY-LY-LY
With you I have fantasies from the high
Wives and straps, you know what there is
Until one with the kush pa 'get high
And in bed your boyfriend already tell him: "Bye"
Gross, Gross with Cojone '
Always using the condom
And pa 'top it puts all' my song '
To leave it gave you sixty -nine thousand reasons
Your toto beats for me more than 12 hearts
And I do 'slow, when we kiss us', time stops
Without word ', we enjoy the moment
And we repeat the story

[Chorus: Lyanno]
Baby, because I want to mistreat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and 'picheo all'
As you none, you beat 'all' (you beat 'all')

[Verse 5: Rauw Alejandro]
(Yeah, Ra-Rauw)
They made you for me
I knew that night I had
A-Appreciated all your nakedness
When my tongue ran all your skin
They made me for you (OH-OH)
You knew when you shouted my name (Ey)
Baby, I am the one that corresponds to you (ah)
What a rich smoking before eating us
Fate changed us to 'plans (ah)
You tell me when to see us again (Wuh!)
You have something more bastard, already forget about him

[Bridge: Rauw Alejandro]
In addition to sex, mommy, I want to love you all
With me you go to heaven, you come to you 'all
Stay with me and 'picheo all'
You tell me, baby, that we look 'to all', with you I'm going to to'a, Yeh

[Verse 6: Cazzu]
How do you want, daddy? Fast or slow?
I am addicted to your movement
And although there are times that I lie to you
At night I feel what I feel for you
People telling us ’what we are 'abnormal'
We always eat 'as if I left' animals'
It is logical that I claim me '
And you know that if I'm with him, he calls me 'and disarm the planets'
Knows' well that as I do not there are two
Using one, doing it
Forgetting 'of the clock
And when she speaks to you, you imagine 'my voice
I already discovered it, that you are for me, that I am for you
Baby, stay here, more close to me, he doesn't make me like this

[Chorus: Cazzu & Alex Rose]
You want to eat everything
He makes it halfway to me, you kisses me 'everything
Stay with me and picheale to all '
Like me, I earn everything '
Come give me all
Today I want to eat you all
He does it halfway, I kiss you all
Stay with me and 'picheo all'
You tell me, baby, and we look 'to all'
Pa 'eat all, Yeh
