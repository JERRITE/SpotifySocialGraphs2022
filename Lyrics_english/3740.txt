Two People Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never want to be second best
And if there's more to your story, then maybe I don't want to know the rest
Just keep me in the dark, let's see how long I can hold my breath before I turn blue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How am I supposed to touch you when somebody touching you is playing in my head?
I don't ever want to think again if it feels like this

[Chorus]
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you live with yourself telling two lies?
Out of my sight, out of my mind
I don't wanna know about it this time
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?
[Verse 2]
I gotta be the only one
You put God in a chokehold, baby, when you think you're having fun
It's not so easy taking back those things you done

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How am I supposed to touch you when somebody touching you is playing in my head?
I don't ever want to think again if it feels like this

[Chorus]
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you live with yourself telling two lies?
Out of my sight, out of my mind
I don't wanna know about it this time
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?

[Bridge]
O-ooh
Too many lovers in this world
You're gonna lose both
Too many boys and girls
Oh, you know you're gonna lose both
Too many lovers in this world

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How am I supposed to touch you when somebody's touching you?

(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you live with yourself telling two lies?
Out of my sight, out of my mind
I don't wanna know about it this time (I don't wanna know this time)
(Oh-oo-oh) Could you love two people at the same time?

Could you love two people at the same time?
Could you live with yourself telling two lies?
Out of my sight, out of my mind
I don't wanna know about it this time
Could you love two people at the same time?3Embed
