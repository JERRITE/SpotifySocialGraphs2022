Falling in love with "falling in love" by Cabas

Things in life
More beautiful and more beautiful
They are the ones that were not waiting
We are knowing you and me
And we are starting to fall in love

I miss a long way, I love you with you
But we already wish, we are already dancing you and I
The next step, it can be a kiss, woe to God!
Be in love
Sure is the best state
I want love to be like that
As we always dream

I miss a long way, I love you with you
But we already wish, we are already dancing you and I
The next step, it can be a kiss, woe to God!

Be in love
Sure is the best state
I want love to be like that
As we always dream

Be in love
Sure is the best state
I want love to be like that
As we always dream

I want to fall in love with you again
And start over, love
That we never forget that first kiss, woe to God!

Be in love
Sure is the best state
I want love to be like that
As we always dream
You might also like that love is like that
As we always dream about it
