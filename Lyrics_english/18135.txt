Teenage Heartbreak Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
It's a high, it’s a low
It's a rollercoaster
That I ride every time that you say it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me like
Oh God, will it ever end?
I won’t fall in love again
Oh shit, here we go again
Teenage heartbreak
[Chorus]
We make out, make mistakes
Go through hell for heaven's sake
Find out love is fucking fake
That's teenage heartbreak
We break up every day
Make up just so we're okay
Hurts so much to be awake
That's teenagе heartbreak

[Verse 2]
Give you all that I got
Whilе you give me nothin' (Woah)
It was fun for a while, now we barely function (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me like
Oh God, will it ever end?
I won't fall in love again
Oh shit, here we go again
Teenage heartbreak

[Chorus]
We make out, make mistakes
Go through hell for heaven's sake
Find out love is fucking fake
That’s teenage heartbreak
We break up every day
Make up just so we’re okay
Hurts so much to be awake
That's teenage heartbreak

Teenage heartbreak

[Bridge]
Every time I fall in love
I just wanna fall apart
Every time I fall in love
I just want it all to stop

[Chorus]
We make out, make mistakes
Go through hell for heaven’s sake
Find out love is fucking fake
That's teenage heartbreak
We break up every day
Make up just so we're okay
Hurts so much to be awake
That's teenage heartbreak

[Outro]
