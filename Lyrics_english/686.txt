TranslationEnglish200 Cups Lyrics [letter of "200 cups"]

[Intro]
Mmm-mmm
Oh, h
Mmm-mmm
Good night to all, huh
I decided today, to sing to these places where people normally eat and do not listen to one, but
There is a very special friend who is listening to this song
Friend, Marica, now
Mmm-mmm-mmm, well
Here I go, give it
[Verse 1]
I see her suffering alone even if I deny it
Lips bite for being strong
How many hours of crying are enough
To understand that no love? So luck
She tries to endure and don't get angry
It gives you more love because you don't want to lose you
But what is it going, no longer cries for you
Today I will ask him to leave you because you are not worth na '

[Chorus]
Friend, leave that clown alone
If they were paid to make you suffer it would be a millionaire
From now on it becomes an adversary
And today we go to drink if necessary
And we take the two hundred glasses that have in the bar
And we went up to sing the "tusa" until everyone leaves
Tonight you will fulfill my mission
It is that you repeat: "The piece 'and shit is him and it's not me"

[Interlude]
Oh
Serve another

[Verse 2]
Again it fails and says that he feels it
The truquito already has that pa 'convincing you
The routine is that with another it has fun
He gets home and wants to get the innocent
Has Pa 'Buy with details
And a lip, Jum, worth recovering you
But what goes, you do not cry anymore
Tell that asshole to leave because nothing is worth

Friend, leave that clown alone
If they were paid to make you suffer it would be a millionaire
From now on it becomes an adversary
And today we go to drink if necessary
And we take the two hundred glasses that have in the bar
And we went up to sing the "tusa" until everyone leaves
Tonight you will fulfill my mission
It is that you repeat: "The piece 'and shit is him and it's not me"

[Outro]
Where are they not looking for you
But, this goes for all
Show him that he will have to put more son of a bitch if he wants to see you cry again
So above those glasses, health! Embed
