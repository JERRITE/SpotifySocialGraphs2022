I will never forget the most beautiful thing
I have lived with you
The details the things
That will remind me
Now I'm going to leave
Well you decided
I understand it and I moved away
Not without telling you

That the time that hard our love
You made me happy
And in my goodbye I wish you the best
But where are you
I will never forget you
I swear no
I will try to forget you
If you want my love
I don't care for me
I want you to die
Above all things ......
Together the most beautiful
I have lived with you
The details the things
That will remind me
Now I'm going to leave
Well you decided
I understand it and I moved away
Not without telling you

That the time that hard our love
You made me happy
And in my goodbye I wish you the best
But where are you
I will never forget you
I swear no
I will try to forget you
If you want my love
I don't care for me
I want you to die
Above all things ......
