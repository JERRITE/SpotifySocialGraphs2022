The soul standing (live) LyricScu√°nto nights in my bed I pronounced your name
Among these four walls in my room
How many hours have I waited for your absent call
Or your repentant voice in the answering machine
How many silent words
When between your lips;
Mine gave kisses without contemplation
How many afternoons we ate kisses, how many!
As many days you made you left, love
Do not look back
Well, I'm fighting
I don't know how to have me
With the soul standing
Without you it is hard for me to breathe
I know very well that you
You will not return
That you know, like me
No love will be delivered
I don't know how to have me
With the soul standing
Without you it is hard for me to breathe
The train passes once
For you it will not return
That you know, how do I
No love will be delivered
The distance is so much that it feels when
You loved someone with all your passion
And good to first of whom you were
He leaves, carrying your heart furniture
Do not look back
Well, I'm fighting
I don't know how to have me
With the soul standing
Without you it is hard for me to breathe
I know very well that you
You will not return
That you know, like me
No love will be delivered
I don't know how to have me
With the soul standing
Without you it is hard for me to breathe
The train passes once
For you it will not return
That you know, how do I
No love will be delivered might also likembed
