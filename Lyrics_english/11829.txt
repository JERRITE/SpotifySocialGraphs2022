[Intro: Farruko & Almighty]
Trapxficant
These people are very powerful
Tell me, help me
Millet, nobody turns to the pattern
So far you arrived, gonorrhea
(Please help me)
Loyalty
Farru! (Woo!)
[Verse 1]
Aurelio Casillas returned, the saga is not over yet
And when did you see Scooby biting Shaggy's hand?
Song 'and umbrately, when I see me, don't shit'
And permission, Karate Kid, now it's Mister Miyagi
Respect, I'm the fusion between Goku and Vegeta
You have taken more singers, bastard, than a tambourine
You had a plague on top and you got the shit
When you saw that in the cold you hit your loop
You took so many fists that your head is now flat
Bastard, even the chairs put you from Cubana '
Stop being measuring strength 'and does not count' with corduroy
That you have no torque and fall if I feel like
The real capo, I'm Sosa and I'm not Montana
And in music I move like the Tijuana poster
And to everyone who turns us, we open it like a frog
So that when it tries another, think about it and do not want
My straps are Louis Vuitton, yours Carolina Herrera
I looked for you for the fuck and your race fell
Fulano, you signed with the Chota and to 'it was in vain
And now you walk with bodyguards to pa 'inside' and capestrano
I can not take anymore
'Tas Cagao?! Do you not say you pull?
I come 'and bayamón, where the bullets rain
A Lambbicho tunnel, from the Panda they go out with me
You both are shots, protection for witnesses
In the networks a lion, if you saw it as hoarse
I will give you another cookie like the one Tonka gave you
For you come back and you are moving and my kimo greets me
Bastard, you ere 'a smell and there is no one to doubt it

Passengers to Orlando
Please appear at the boarding door
Loen a passage and go pa 'Orlando!
LOL

[Verse 2]
'So gloveing with Mayweather, I came to defend my title
You left for Knockout, this chapter ended here
Bastard, in this league I remain LeBron
Stay by playing Yu-Gi and Pokemon cards
That was what you did before I signed you
Chico, if you were a virgin, before carbon or chingabas
Gordito, you suffered from bullying, you were a asshole
You have made four lipos and still guide you the skin
The guy now believes sexy, wants to sing how the puma
And the selfies are taken posing as Maluma
You left in four babys, I think nobody found out
Lary ate your ass and Anonyimus set you
I notice you in depression, you are pulling like a noon
Maybe it was about the baby, I saw her nail 'in a video
But boy, you calm, that's washed with soap
Montal in this bug now pa 'that cajas pom
Bastard, don't mention pattern
Rest in peace my Brother, I take you in my heart
With the dead do not fuck, you will give you the cylinder head
Hopefully and you appear and pull you on both legs
Pa 'what knows', mono knows the stick that climbs' well
Now don't say 'you're crazy and you didn't take the pepa'
There is no longer consideration, I watched you 'to put the pressure
For you know, lambebicho, that I saw 'to take action
[Chorus]
And oh, oh, oh, say it's an assault
Say that it is an assault, while the helmet I give you
Oh, oh, oh, say it's an assault
Say that it is an assault, while the helmet I give you

[Skit 2]
They left, all good
Cries, cry, cries
I'm an artist, I'm not a puppet
Bring me the violin

[Verse 3]
What a fuck? What Ere 'is a mammon
Here I have a crossbow, Bríllame the Aventador
Call yourself to electricity that there was a blackout here
This bastard forced me and the transformer exploded
No one has replaced me, I'm still in force
And I still give you sticks like Roberto Clemente
None will turn me off, you bastard, I'm still making money
And in your league they jumped Anuel AA and Bad Bunny
Bastard, you are burning, your career is in decline
Ray the r is the one who fits you and Chris Wandell is the one who writes you
And the shit 'e guagua that, go and pay the cover
That after this neighborhood the vo'a see in class offer
I don't laugh at garments, scratch, I don't be illusable
That this Hublot was mine and they have not saved on Russian
You did the waist and the skin are still soft
Bastard, but do the face and ears for when?
The Mexicans help
Colombia and the Cubans
That after this, singing and 'fool
I just break the anus
I am like Phil Jackson, ten draws in my hands
And this Christmas I saw 'to eat' to this pig
Because you ere 'a meringuero, merenguero, merenguero
And before throwing me, you bastard, practice first
And don't turn in an eight
What are you a thousand eight
What is transmissions, I have pistons
Bastard, I'm just a V-8
I'm going to make you a pussy
In the helmet a sancocho
Do not walk alone
Where do I get, even if you walk with eight
Panda, Panda
We are going to give you a parranda
If they give you, quickly pocoteas
And look for Farruko, who is the one who sends them
Panda, Panda
After this, MUDATE PA 'HOLANDA
What the Connect Chapiá that you use '
I am going to put them as a scarf
Finish Him

[Outro]
Carbon Fiber Music
The company that gave birth to you
Yes, the same
Frank Miami
This bastard, lost smell
MALFIED LAMBEBICHO East
Obrinn
Kaldtronik
Tell me flow
Hey, Boca 'E bug
Call who you want '
Pay the Prote
Hire nine more security
Look for an army if you want ', bastard
More na 'you vo' say
Look
I am really going to be short and precise with you, I sing and 'bastard
You 'what e' is a bad, bastard
When you 'were taking out the snacks
I was the first bastard that put a microphone in my hands, smell
You 'what I was doing was loading a bug and recording
They bet on those chamaquitos
Because nobody wanted to sing you
And I said:
"Mera, my brother, goal hand, vamo 'pa' on top"
And I turned it a star
U you 'is so ugly
That turns and makes the madman
And he says it's crazy
Mere, bastard
Usté wanted to be Guillar de Don Omar
With Héctor and did not come out, you bastard
You 'is garbage
And the fat pork, who asked for the grace '
The handling of yours, who also passed with me
Sucking the bug, scratching the bug
For me to give him a break
I gave it to him and look how he turned
For me, that both die, bastards
That this is Carbon Fiber
And I'm not going to breastfeed, or call bugotes, bastard
I fall and break your head
To you and the fat mamabicho. And to the brother, too
Without balls they have
Burguen with that
And this is the only one and the last one I am going to do to you, I sing 'and bastard
And stop talking shit
That if I turned here, that if I turned there
Mere, my brother, I am a man
And that's why Pope God blesses me
Because I am a person that I am loyal
And I have done my thing by force of sweat and sacrifice
You 'what it is, it is a parasite
Tyme ninety times if you want ', after this
What are you ignoring as shit
Because that's what you are, you bastard
A shit ball
And he who represents, who wants to get
Let me know
Here we are read for it, in truth '
We do not believe 'in anyone
Neither in names, nor in Na 'de ESO
That the pot mama, in truth '
We are in the one of ours
Sincerely, the new Father
But improved and redesigned
You heard, Boca 'E bug
Hahahahambed
