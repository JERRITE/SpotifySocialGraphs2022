Caught by the Fuzz Lyrics[Verse 1]
Caught by the fuzz
While I was still on a buzz
In the back of the van
With my head in my hands
Just like a bad dream
I was only fifteen

[Chorus 1]
If only my brother could be here now
He'd get me out he'd sort me out alright
I knew I should have stayed at home tonight
[Verse 2]
Locked in the cell
Feeling unwell
I talked to a man
He said "It's better to tell
Who sold you the blow"
Well, it was no one I know

[Chorus 2]
"If only you'd tell us we'd let you go
We'll make it hard for you my son, so tell us what you know
We'll make you wish you'd stayed at home tonight"

[Verse 3]
Here comes my mum
Well she, she knows what I've done
"Just tell them the truth
You know where it's from
You've blackened our name
Well you, you should be ashamed"

[Chorus 3]
"If only your father could see you now
He'd break down and he'd throw you out for sure
I never should have let you out tonight" (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
