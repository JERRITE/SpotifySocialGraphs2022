What had forgotten Lyrics [letter of "what I had forgotten"]

[Verse 1]
That fear that gives you calling, trying to seem normal
Everything to say, everything to do
I already forgot it, love had treated me badly
To fall in love there is no manual
How to laugh again, how to be again
How to give up again for a woman

[Chorus]
I had already forgotten
What feels like falling too much
Fly a thousand butterflies with you by my side
The adrenaline that gives you a stolen kiss
I had dreamed you
I know you from another life and I have you
I want to provide for Cupid today and that you are by my side
Why just to look at you remembered
What had forgotten-a -ado
What had forgotten-a -ado, oh
[Verse 2]
I really don't know what happened, I felt it when she looked at me
And that magic goes inside, it is that feeling that hits different and that makes me look at you like this
And now I don't want to live without you

[Chorus]
I had already forgotten
What feels like falling too much
Fly a thousand butterflies with you by my side
The adrenaline that gives you a stolen kiss
I had dreamed you
I know you from another life and I have found you
I want to provide for Cupid today and that you are by my side
Because just by looking at you, I remembered
What had forgotten-a -ado
What had forgotten-a -ado
What had forgot '

[Outro]
There is something I remembered, with you I feel everything
I feel everything with you, huh
There is something that happened to me, I swear I feel everything
I feel everything with you, huh
There is something I remembered, with you I feel everything
I feel everything with you, huh
There is something that happened to me, I swear I feel everything
I feel everything contigoyou might Also likembed
