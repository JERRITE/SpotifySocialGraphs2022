The Longer I Run LyricsWhen my blood runs warm with the warm red wine
I missed the life that I left behind
And when I hear the sound of the black bird's cry
I know I left in the nick of time
Well this road I'm on is gonna turn to sand
And leave me lost in a far off land
So let me ride the wind till I don't look back
And forget the life that I almost had

If I wander till I die
May I know whose hand I'm in
If my home I'll never find
And let me live again
The longer I run then the less that I find
Selling my soul for a nickel and dime
Breaking my heart to keep singing these rhymes
And losing again
The longer I run then the less that I find
Selling my soul for a nickel and dime
Breaking my heart to keep singing these rhymes
And losing again
Tell my brother please not to look for me
I ain't the man that I used to be
Cause if my savior comes could you let him know
I've gone away forward to save my soul

If I wander till I die
May I know whose hand I'm in
If my home I'll never find
And let me live again
The longer I run then the less that I find
Selling my soul for a nickel and dime
Breaking my heart to keep singing these rhymes
And losing again
The longer I run then the less that I find
Selling my soul for a nickel and dime
Breaking my heart to keep singing these rhymes
And losing againYou might also likeEmbed
