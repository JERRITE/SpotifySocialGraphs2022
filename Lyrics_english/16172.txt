I Just Want a Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the united hate of America
The hearts are just as broken as the nation
Where all we do is tear each other down
Trapped inside this permanent staycation

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe I didn’t see
A mistake is just a state of my identity
And I believed that I will never, ever get it right
[Chorus]
The twistin' of the knife, the bend until the break
And then it all goes wrong
A kiss and I go blind, can't see, it’s just my fate
And it's unlivable
Yeah, I just want a lover who's in love with me
Not another liar making love to me
I'm sick of hopin', tired of waitin'
I just want a lover who's in love with me

[Verse 2]
I pick my conscience over clarity
And deal with the disparity, it's anarchy
And the narcissists all run at me
With guns ablaze, no empathy, insanity

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t believe I didn’t see
A mistake is just a state of my identity
I got a feelin' I will never, ever get it right

[Chorus]
The twistin’ of the knife, the bend until the break
And then it all goes wrong
A kiss and I go blind, can't see, it's just my fate
And it's unlivable
Yeah, I just want a lover who’s in love with me
Not another liar making love to me
I'm sick of hopin', tired of waitin'
I just want a lover who's in love with me

In the united hate of America
