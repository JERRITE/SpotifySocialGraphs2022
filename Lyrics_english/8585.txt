Man on Fire Lyrics[Hook]
I'm a man on fire walking down your street
With one guitar and two dancing feet
Only one desire that's left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come dance with me
Oh, come dance with me over murder and pain
Come set you free over heartache and shame
I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from
Everybody want safety (Safety love)
Everybody want comfort (Comfort love)
Everybody want certain (Certain love)
Everybody but me

[Hook]
I'm a man on fire walking down your street
With one guitar and two dancing feet
Only one desire that's left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come dance with me

Yay, yay, come dance with me over heartache and rage
Come set us free over panic and strange
I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from

Everybody want romance (Romance love)
Everybody want safety (Safety love)
Everybody want comfort (Comfort love)
Everybody but me

[Hook]
I’m a man on fire (he’s a man on fire)
Walking down your street (walking down your street)
With one guitar (With one guitar)
And two dancing feet (two dancing feet)
Only one desire (one desire)
That’s still in me (that’s left in me)
I want the whole damn world (I want the whole damn world)
To come and dance with me (come and dance with me yeahhhhh…)You might also like3Embed
