Where are you? Lyrics [see 1]
Waking up at twelve and always alone
Good morning, a thousand messages and none has value
I am leaving, the lost hours
Showing a reflection of what I want, but I am not
Yates, trips and a lot of money
All is part of a little sincere world
Seek makeup, what is normal to us
But in the end

[Chorus]
Where are you?
All those who were looking for my friendship
All those loves with which I was going to marry
Where are those stories?
That the happy ending I do not find
Where are you?
That feeling of having freedom
Everything between the lines, without being able to color
Where are those stories?
That the happy ending I do not find
I can't find it (no)
Those moments (no)
Of being happy (no)
Feel eternal (no)

[See 2]
Taking and smoking only to feel
How silly to think that makes me happy
I live cheated with people by my side
That instead of helping, they take advantage of you
My mom has always warned me
That many, only few stay with you
That is worth two to be a cautious man
And in the end there will always be evil on some good path

[Chorus]
Where are you? (Where are you)
All those who were looking for my friendship
All those loves with whom I was going to marry
Where are those stories?
That the happy ending I do not find
Where is it?
That feeling of having freedom
Everything between the lines, without being able to color
Where are those stories?
That the happy ending I do not find
You Might Also Likeyo I can't find it (no)
Those moments (no)
Of being happy (no)
Feel eternal (no)

I can't find it (no)
Those moments (no)
Of being happy (no)
Feel eternal (no)

[Bridge]
Where are you?
All, all, all, my friendship
All those loves, loves with which
Those stories
That the happy ending I do not find

[Chorus]
Where is it?
That feeling of having freedom
Everything between the lines, without being able to color
Where are those stories?
That the happy ending I do not find

[Outro]
Yates, trips and a lot of money
All is part of a little sincere world
But I already learned that to be happy
You just have to live, the Momentambed
