Swing, Swing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Days swiftly come and go
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions astir
The sun is gone
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you think that I would cry
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new
[Chorus]
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

[Verse 2]
Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you think that I would cry
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

[Chorus]
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

Bury me
(You thought your problems were gone)
Carry me
(Away, away, away)

[Chorus]
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find16Embed
