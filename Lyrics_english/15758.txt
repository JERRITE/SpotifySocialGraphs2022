I dreamed you lyrics ["I dreamed you"]

[Intro]
Last night I dreamed with you
I dreamed that you were by my side as before
It was a love more than friends
I wanted to undress you
I woke up allusinating (ey)
Eager to continue dreaming
I don't know why I'm still feeling like this
I swear I still miss you and-
I don't know why, if I know, you have another
I keep revealing me, thinking about us
That although I have not seen you anymore, I have memories in my history
And although everything had to end, I have not found how to overcome
[Verse 1]:
In the dream I felt that I had your arms
The heat of your skin in my hands
I know that everything was a failure
But loving you know it wasn't in vain
Nothing was perfect and I understand
But I still feel
I'm not the same
Since I Do not Have You

[Chorus]:
Yesterday I dreamed you
Dont ask me why
With you I stumbled
It hurt when I woke up
Yesterday I dreamed you
Dont ask me why
With you I stumbled
And it hurt when I woke up
YE-YEAH

[Verse 2]:
Since you left
To sleep, I need pills
I am still waiting
Sitting in the same chair
Now it is complicated
But before you were so simple
I spend drunk
But my mind does not forget you
And I know (-se)
That everything left (everything left)
I want to look for you
Have what I had before
Again that you are mine
But I still dream
