Like a Drug Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck you been at?
Nah fuck that, where y'all been all day?
You know I'm just playing with you
Shit, you coming through tonight?
You know I gotta have it
Shit, I'll be right here
Just hit me when you 'bout to pull up, over
(You're my drug, you're my drug, ooh
You're my drug, you're my drug, ooh)
[Verse 1]
Head over heels for you baby
No one else, yeah that's for sure (No one else)
I would never leave you girl
Take the handle off the door
Your love is loud
I'm high as shit, I'm high as shit, girl
I'm on a cloud, wanna break you down some more
I'm talking to her
Girl you got that bomb, call it Bombay
Spend the night at the crib with the $ign, babe
It's six in the morning, I wake up, I'm zoning, zoning
I need you

[Chorus]
Baby you're like a drug
Baby you're like a drug, a drug
Baby you're like a drug
Baby you're like a drug, a drug
I want to meet the plug (Oh yeah)
Introduce me to the plug (Oh yeah)
Where you get all this love
(That love, take me straight to your plug, girl)

[Verse 2]
Put it on my tongue like a tab, baby
Bet I'll make you choke like a dab, baby
You always had my back, baby
I need another bag from that ass, baby
Girl I'm so selfish
It's a shame I can't share this
No I won't, no
Greedy with the plug, I am
Girl I'm so addicted, 'cause
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby you're like a drug
Baby you're like a drug, a drug
Baby you're like a drug
Baby you're like a drug, a drug
I want to meet the plug (Oh yeah)
Introduce me to the plug (Oh yeah)
Where you get all this love
(That love, take me straight to your plug, girl)

[Bridge]
You're like a drug (Yeah, yeah)
You're like a lean, got me sick, when I don't got you
Like the weed, I'm a fiend, girl I gotta have you
Like a molly, feel it all over my body
Keep me coming back for more
Spending up all my money
Oh yeah (Ooh yeah)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby you're like a drug
Baby you're like a drug, a drug (Ooh yeah)
Baby you're like a drug (Oh yeah, drug)
Baby you're like a drug, a drug
I want to meet the plug (Oh yeah)
Introduce me to the plug (Oh yeah)
Where you get all this love
(That love, take me straight to your plug, girl)4Embed
