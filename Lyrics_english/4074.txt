One day my house was alone
I took my cell phone and I said hello
I remember what he told me, I have nothing to do
Then I immediately invite her
Invite her for my house to watch a movie
But in reality or we saw any movie
Obviously, logically, my intention was different
I had to act intelligently
So that the desire would not be so obvious

Then I take her to my room
And I said, pretty comfortable
Or if you want we are going from here
If you feel uncomfortable

And at least we think
We can't stand we kiss
It was inevitable that he did not touch her

And he told me, don't stop
Look what you have, too excited
And he told me, don't stop
Look that you have me too excited

And until today
She looks for me to kiss her still
Who wants to repeat the last time
That he liked a lot and that is delighted
I am delighted
You Might Also Likey I also want
Knowing about her again
I also told him in front
We have to see ourselves more frequent

That what we live at that moment
It was interesting, it was interesting
What we live at that moment

And I also want
Knowing about her again
I also told him in front
We have to see ourselves more frequent

Because what we live at that moment
It was interesting, it was interesting
What we live at that moment

Only perreo is what there is

Then I take her to my room
And I said, pretty comfortable
Or if you want we are going from here
If you feel uncomfortable
