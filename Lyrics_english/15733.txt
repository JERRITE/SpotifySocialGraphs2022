It was she was me Lyricsfui, because I was already so secret
Other times distant, so far
No s, it was better too
That he was always jealous, that Nuna wanted to believe
It was her or me, it was her or me
The s, what we had already left us
Could more pride, could less faith
Loving is much more than one word
It is the daily battle that we forget to win
It was her or me, it was her or me
Chorus:
It was her, I was me and it's too late for both
Because we hurt ourselves, because I don't hear it
Because she leaves me only when I need her most
It was her, I was me
I was me because although I really always am
I need to retain her, I miss, I don't know
Maybe, it was she who didn't expect me
I was always busy, always a little more
It was her or me
Chorus:
It was her, I was me and it's too late for both
Because we hurt ourselves, because I don't hear it
Because she leaves me only when I need her most
Because I was very cold
She asked for more heat
Not what else can be done
If the culprits were both
It was her, I was me, it was she
Because I was very cold
She asked for more heat
And not what can I do
If the culprits were both
It was her, I was me, I strange her
