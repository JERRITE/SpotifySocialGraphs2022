Another lyric tape [intro]
Ayy, sometimes ...
I think that...
You are the best in the world, seriously

[Chorus]
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint
(With those holes on the cheeks
I see you and the ants are disturbed)
[Verse 1]
With your eyes Achina'os from Japanese or Thai
(Well that does not matter)
What plot me is how you talk to imagine how you kiss
(Shakespeare's English literature)
I would like to be the Venice merchant
For you will save me and forgive my debts
Or that you were behind me like Pucca behind Garu
I love when we both go and we kill (Pop corn)
To travel the world in our song
Pa 'that we dance in Europe, Africa or Ecuador
(I know that for you) it was that Korea separated
And that I am throwing the semester that is the worst

[Chorus]
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint
(Thousands of colored 'in my smile
You are a nice alternative)
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint

[Post-car]
And I don't understand why you say no
If it was the destiny that came to find us
It wasn't your face that entangled me
Nor your long hair
If not your way of thinking
And I don't understand why you say no
If it was the destiny that came to find us
It wasn't your face that entangled me
Nor your long hair
If not your way of thinking

The truth is that I don't want to be rude with you, I tell you
But the moon is horrible if I compare it with you
Yes, I know it's cruel
But what I feel for you is bigger than the Eiffel Tower
So let's go for France, let's go here
We married there in the Notre Dame Cathedral
From there we are going to sail like Rose and Jack in the Titanic
If we wreck we move and now
Hey, nothing will happen to you
With me na 'will happen to you

Chorus]
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint
(Thousands of colored 'in my smile
You are a nice alternative)
Because you are a video, a movie, another tape
Of the others different I love your line, your style, your pint
(With those holes on the cheeks
I see you and the ants are disturbed)

[Outro]
With Markinho's star performance
Ey, Yera Music
The L'Omy Music
You know this is Music
I don't do songs to anyone, you know no but ...
This is pa 'ti
You know what is pa 'trembed
