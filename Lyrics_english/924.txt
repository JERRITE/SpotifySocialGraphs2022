Just for you to remember lyrics [verse 1]
I made this song just for you to remember
From when we didn't want anything
Fucked on the stairs, in the elevator with the camera filming
Remember when you didn't even care
When was the last time you smoked a based
Had sex in the dirty bathroom of the nightclub
Last time you set free, flew
Which sexual fantasy performed
Drank, drank then vomited
What you did to realize your dream
What you wished there for your future
Remember when we wanted the world, the world
I made this song just for you to remember
What is worth living if we don't have the right to make mistakes
I want the freedom to be who I am
Love how I loved my first love
[Chorus]
I made this song just for you to remember
Behind you I will
I'm going to the end of the world
I still want everything, everything, everything
I made this song just for you to remember
Behind you I will
I'm going to the end of the world
I still want everything, everything, everything

[Verse 2]
I made this song just for you to remember
From when we didn't want anything
Loved on the stairs, in the elevator with the camera filming
Remember when you didn't even care
What was the last time you got drunk
Kissed in the dirty bathroom of the nightclub
Last time you broke free, flew
What fantasy did you realize
Drank vodka, energetic
What you did to realize your dream
What you wished there for your future
Remember when we wanted the world
I made this song just for you to remember
What is worth living if we don't have the right to make mistakes
I want the freedom to be who I am
Love as I loved, love how I loved
You might also like [chorus]
I made this song just for you to remember
Behind you I will
I'm going to the end of the world
I still want everything, everything, everything
I made this song just for you to remember
Behind you I will
I'm going to the end of the world
I still want everything, everything, everything
