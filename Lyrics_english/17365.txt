Vaccine Lyrics[Intro]
(Al Geno on the track)

[Chorus]
We give that nigga shots just like Johnson & Johnson
I rock Heron Preston 'cause nigga I'm a junky
I know it's hard to tell but I was broke before, I promise
All that free time got 'em lying but I'm too busy being honest
Ayy, panoramic, ayy, I know how to whip that
When she get in it, ayy, he can't get his bitch back
Soon you don't acknowledge them, niggas go to switching sides
From a cell to a mansion like I'm Quagmire
[Verse]
DA, she ain't got no evidence so I ain't copping out
Opps be tryna talk it out but it ain't shit to talk about
Niggas that I grew up with and love, they all jealous now
I miss 'em and I want them niggas 'round but they got too much pride
In and out of court, I had it hard, dawg
I wonder what happen when a star fall
Tryna boost your rank, don't wanna separate
I hope you don't turn so let me illustrate
I hope I don't lose it but you know my life like a movie and I can't forget about it
I'm still on probation and I hope the PO don't search my house, it got too many choppers
I gave her chances and chances, I gave her my life, but she was just in and out it
So she fucked it up for the rest of them hoes, get a star and I treat her like anybody
Put that whip up in reverse and bring that bag out
I'm high, my pockets swole, I'm walking 'round with astronauts
Ain't no insurance on them shooters when they crashing
This shit like vaccine

[Chorus]
We give that nigga shots just like Johnson & Johnson
I rock Heron Preston 'cause nigga I'm a junky
I know it's hard to tell but I was broke before, I promise
All that free time got 'em lying but I'm too busy being honest
Panoramic, ayy, I know how to whip that
When she get in it, ayy, he can't get his bitch back
Soon you don't acknowledge them, niggas go to switching sides
From a cell to a mansion like I'm QuagmireYou might also like2Embed
