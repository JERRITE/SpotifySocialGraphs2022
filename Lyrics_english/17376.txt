.223 Lyrics[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices, we sell out the dorm
Sky-Dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch came to see me like five in the morning
We carryin' these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like they Jordans
Cashing out numerous thousands in Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it
[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
This is a Bentley, bitch, this not a Lexus (Skrrt)
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section (Vroom)
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owens my jacket
Pull up, I Lam' it, no I won't crash it
Rockstar lifestyle like my name Lenny Kravitz
Cartier diamonds, the frame in my glasses
No, no, no, you can not get these lens crafters
I shook his hand I was smiling and laughing
We killed that nigga, came out like, “What happened?“ (What happened?)
What happened, lil nigga? What happened?
It's Mister Geeked-Up, I'm never not laughing
I stay with my twin like my name is Shannon
Blacken my fish, and no pink call it salmon (Yeah)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices, we sell out the dorm
Sky-Dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch came to see me like five in the morning
We carryin' these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like they Jordans
Cashing out numerous thousands in Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

Pussy cool but her head is retarded
Make one false move and your head is a target (Target)
Lot of drip and I still ain't rewarded (Uh, uh, uh)
Still ball with my crew like I play with the Hornets
Rage EDM like my bro DJ Carnage
I can walk in Magic, turn the weather to stormy (Stormy)
These four bitches wanna give me an orgy (Uh)
You hear the horses when we runnin' these Porsches
Drop the top off it like I get sore
Come see the paint on my Christian Dior (Christian Dior)
Comin' up really had this shit hard
Now bet you won't see me shoppin' in Zara (Shoppin' in Zara)
Went straight on the white, I got hard
Sixty whole rounds in that mini-AR (Mini-AR)
Comin' up some of my dogs caught the yard
Now Young GunWunna got me A&Rs

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices, we sell out the dorm
Sky-Dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch came to see me like five in the morning
We carryin' these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like they Jordans
Cashing out numerous thousands in Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it19Embed
