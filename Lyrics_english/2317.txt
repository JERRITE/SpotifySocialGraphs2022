TranslationsPortuguêsFace to Face Lyrics[Intro]
I grew up, you grew down, we found out
Everything matters now (Everything)
We grew up while you let yourself down
I want out

[Verse 1]
She calmed me down that night I freaked out
We stayed up, I threw up in that house
She woke up face-to-face from the bed
Two in the en-suite, one in the early
She was like eight hours ahead
Two different countries, slept in a one-piece
Baby boy in full effect
And you couldn't see me, call back, repeat
That's all thanks to poor connection
Fun for me, no
Most time, it's a pain in the neck
I said it's not that fun, see
Everything makes me wanna quit while I'm ahead
Honestly
[Chorus]
She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset, but

[Post-Chorus]
Never had done
No, I never had
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Maybe we grew outward (Yeah)
It's true, I kept the truth to myself
Now I'm nothing but a coward (Cow-)
And you were too busy making friends
You were occupied, I was in the shower
You were unaware, I was fully clothed
And you didn't know about this
But you wouldn't even really need to know
So continue picking flowers (Mm)
Remember why you're here, my friend
You can sit back and relax
And they'll always love you now and then
They'll always love you now and then
Always love you now and then
They'll always love you
It's true

She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset

[Post-Chorus]
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend

[Bridge]
My only friend, 100 percent
I unplugged, then I dipped on my friends
My world got so much smaller this year
Tell me 'bout it

[Chorus]
She wakes, we face-to-face from her bed
Instead, instead, yeah
When we speak face-to-face from the head
From the head, yeah, yeah
She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset
[Post-Chorus]
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend

[Outro]
I grew up, you grew down, we found out
Everything matters now
We grew up while you let yourself down
I want out8Embed
