We Set the Trends Lyrics[Intro: Takeoff, Jim Jones & Lil Jon]
Migo, brrt
Talkin' to me crazy, nigga
Been havin' that shit on, nigga
Drippin' to the floor, to the door, nigga, you hear me?
My goddamn cup
Yeah (Bordeaux and Non Native)
Gangsta Grillz, huh

[Chorus: Takeoff]
We set the trends (Trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (Brrt)
It's just me and my gang (Gang)
Fuck niggas, we don't do friends (Fuck)
What he say? He want smoke? (Smoke)
We gon' spin (Brrt), spin again (Takeoff)
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I been tryna get the money, I been tryna feed my fam
'Cause these niggas they don't wanna see me win (No)
I was thinkin' 'bout the Rollie, but I went and got the Richie
Then I went and put my momma in the Benz (Momma)
I get it in (Get it), in the pent' suite fuckin' two twins
I thought about the Glock, but I went F&N (Bop)
And a nigga spin this shit without a pen (Spin)
I call Jimmy, kick it with the billies (Billi')
We already ran up a milli' (Milli')
So that shit ain't really interestin' (Nah)
He outta line, he get a penalty (Penalty)
Said he start it, then I'ma finish him (Finish him)
Stomp a nigga, fed up, in my Timberlands (Timberlands)
Hangin' with the vampires and gremlins (Gremlins)
Got them hoes lined up, assembly (Assembly)
Not your average nigga in the industry

[Chorus: Takeoff]
We set the trends (Trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (Brrt)
It's just me and my gang (Gang)
Fuck niggas, we don't do friends (Fuck)
What he say? He want smoke? (Smoke)
We gon' spin (Brrt), spin again

First I did the Chrome Heart, then I gave 'em BB's
First nigga come through in True Religion (Facts)
Cut my money back up, put a kilo on my neck
Man this shit is worth like two bitches (Brrat)
Come through drippin' (Uh)
First nigga move, I'm hit 'em (Baow)
The next nigga move, you go wit' 'em
But I ain't here to talk no middleman shit
You got a boss? Then you should go get 'em
Where he at? We set the trends
Big F&N when I step out the Benz (I got it)
My lil' bousin' did it, man
He just been trapped in six
Now he fresh out the pen (Now we actin' bad)
You know what's up, we goin' up
We are not comin' down (Not at all)
This bitch don't trip, better watch for the crown
All these rocks in my watch with the crown
Now it's chop a nigga down (Go)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Chop a nigga down, choppa gang (Chop)
The thirty holdin' up the wallet chain (Grrah)
Movin' like the fuckin' president (Move)
Ten cars hoggin' up the lane (Skrrt)
Trappin' at the house before the fame (Trap)
Diamonds do the flash, like I'm walkin', take a picture (Flash)
He'll do it for the cheap when you send him on a mission (Street)
Quickest wipe down, wipe his name off the list (What?)
Flip the switch on it (Switch), then the sticks started glistenin' (Stick)
If I'm gon' smoke it then we raise a tissue (Smoke)
My pinky one-forty and my watch is three-fifty
My bitch like to scissor, she came with three bitches (Six)
We don't fuck with snitchin', we protect the business (Bus')
We straight out the trenches, the mud was sticky (Ooh)
It too many real niggas, we don't fake kick it (Real)
We set the trend in the cities (Trends)
We came to fuck up the city, just Migos and Jimmy (Uh)
[Chorus: Takeoff & Offset]
Uh, we set the trends (Trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (Brrt, Offset)

[Verse 4: Offset]
Hundred-fifty on the Panamera (Panamera)
When I'm pullin' up, they starin'
Put a Richard on my wrist, it be retarded like Little Daryl
Niggas want the smoke, I tell 'em try me, nigga, dare 'em (Smoke)
White Lamborghini, yeah I call that bitch a Karen (Karen)
When I hit the Draco that bitch soundin' like a snare (Grrt)
The way the diamonds hittin' off the Patek, it ain't fair (Woo)
I'ma hit your bitch and give her back, I like to share 'em (Share 'em)
Fuckin' with Diego, man, Diego serve [the mayor?] (Diego)
Automatic when I get to spinnin' on the block (Baow)
Bought a Glock, 'cause then I bought a switch, call it mop (Go)
I don't know the time but it's three hunnid for this watch (Three hunnid)
I'ma put a thot up on the opp and get the drop (Drop)
Niggas try to plot then we gon' hit him like the WAP (Baow)
I'm thinkin' like I'm Roddy Ricch, the stick up in the box (Stick)
I told that bitch no feelings, I just really want the top (Top)
If you ain't talkin' millions, ain't no business, ain't no talk
Twenty-five racks, you can buy some white chalk (Twenty five)
Ferrari lookin' like a caterpillar when it walk (Skrrt)
Swimmin' with piranhas, we was swimmin' with the sharks (Sharks)
I can see the flash when the choppas start to spark (Baow)
Two hundred the dash on the coupe I just bought (Boo)
Two milli' in cash, I just saved up in the vault (Hey)
Started in the bando, now we trappin' out a loft (Bando)
The first three letters of my name, he got off'd (Woo)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
We set the trends (Trends)
Bringin' in ends (Bringin' in cash)
I'ma have to call my accountant to make sure this shit came in (Brrt)
It's just me and my gang (Gang)
Fuck niggas, we don't do friends (Fuck)
What he say? He want smoke? (Smoke)
We gon' spin (Brrt), spin againEmbed
