Easy v2 Lyrics[Chorus: Baird]
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
I put a little skin down somewhere on the curb
It's just a little spin out, sinners gotta learn like
What's a loss of blood when you win a bit of dirt?

[Verse 1: Baird]
Made it to The Angels without four wheels
Met a man in Koreatown with a slick deal
Lime battery on that shit, said he didn't steal it
And I'm not asking questions
I just need the A to B, get me to my sessions
Bro's car, no gas soon as I stepped in
Hitched a ride in Ben's whip
And Ian caught me off a tab and off the guest list
Me and Gabey flipped the light and now they're asking questions
But hope for the best, expect the worst
And look 'em in the eyes don't slur your words
Better memorize it if you sing the verse
And if you think you're slick, you'll go too fast round curves so go
[Chorus: Baird & Kevin Abstract]
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
I put a little skin down somewhere on the curb
It's just a little spin out, sinners gotta learn like
What's a loss of blood when you win a bit of dirt?
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
I put a little skin down somewhere on the curb (Somewhere on the curb)
It's just a little spin out, sinners gotta learn like
What's a loss of blood when you win a bit of dirt?
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns (Haha, [?], yeah)
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns (Yeah, uh-oh)

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Too needy in public (Uh), too perfect to rush it (Uh)
Too hurt to get up out the bed in the morning
Feel pain 'cause I'm suffering
I drink when I don't wanna think about nothing
They chasing down me
Down street, barely keep these jeans on (Uh-oh)
Fall asleep, these days seem too long (Ooh)
If I'd know all y'all wanted was sing-along's
Then I would've stayed at home and gotten more sleep, yo
Want cheat codes (Uh), less ego (Uh)
I want Hollywood (Hollywood), without the evil (Yeah)
I know you cut me off (Yeah), ain't that what friends for?
How you got my back when you treat me like that? (Woo)
I'm tryna make a band, can you cut me some slack?
Was humble for too long but now I got to brag (I said)
Stuck in the mud so I guess I'll never learn
Still a Texas motherfucker so go easy on 'em, easy on 'em

Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
I put a little skin down somewhere on the curb
It's just a little spin out, sinners gotta learn like
What's a loss of blood when you win a bit of dirt?
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
I put a little skin down somewhere on the curb (Somewhere on the curb)
It's just a little spin out, sinners gotta learn like
What's a loss of blood when you win a bit of dirt?
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns
Easy on them turns, easy on them turns

[Outro: Baird]
You won't die (No) just take my advice (Yeah)
Drive slow, bike fast and you'll live right
Drive slow, bike fast and you'll live right
You won't die (No) just take my advice (Yeah)
Drive slow, bike fast and you'll live right
Drive slow, bike fast and you'll live rightEmbed
