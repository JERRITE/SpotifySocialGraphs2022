Can We Wait Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want to talk about me, it's time to talk about me
Strapped with bands, bending paper like it's origami
I'm in Japan with a couple rubber bands
I'll be driving where I can with no return it's like it's kamikaze
Out here where the rivers run with Evian
Fila jacket, where I'm stacking is upper echelon
Vagabond, I'll carry on
Empty pockets, empty sockets where the stack belongs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here we are, I'm here complaining
I'm always waiting, I'm always waiting
Here we are, I'm here complaining
I'm always waiting, I'm always waiting
[Chorus]
I'll be standing out here by the traffic lights
Can you see my eyes?
I'll be in disguise
Can we wait here?
Wearing backpacks like we got our whole pack in mind
Let me see you fly
We will be alive
Can we wait here?

[Verse 2]
Switching lanes when I'm switching veins
Drowned that day when the vision changed
Sky turned grey when I first met Cain and I burst that vein
I reversed that day
Oh yes
Human cyborgs
Step to me and you'll cry more
Daemon said I got to fly more
So I got a beat and started rhyming more
I keep blessed
Got to keep talking, man
Hoes on the VK stalking, man
Ticks on my feet when I'm walking, man
I've got bricks, I'm a G when I'm flaunting, man
I've got a vest
Yeah I've got that Ape on
Lonely boy, I'm like Akon
Every morning eat bacon
I've got ice and cream like I'm Raekwon
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Waiting, waiting
I'm always waiting, I'm always waiting
Here we are, I'm here complaining
I'm always waiting, I'm always waiting

[Chorus]
I'll be standing out here by the traffic lights
Can you see my eyes?
I'll be in disguise
Can we wait here?
Wearing backpacks like we got our whole pack in mind
Let me see you fly
We will be alive
Can we wait here?

[Outro]
Yeah, shout outs my boys
Yeah, my gangs are animals
Yeah, that's right, huh
People coming up here trying to tell me what's tryna' been happening
But, huh, nothings been happening mane
Yeah, you know what it isEmbed
