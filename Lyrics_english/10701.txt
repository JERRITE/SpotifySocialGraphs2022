Let It Blow Lyrics[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store
[Verse 1: Cuban Doll]
Look bitch, you a dirty ass trick
Always got yo hand out
I'm Cuban Doll, I stand out
That's why I brought my mans out
'Cuz I got them bands now
'Cuz we in a Benz now
Break it down, smoke a pound
It's a damn shame how they change for the fame
Fuck a name, I'm in the game, I make it rain
You's a lame, I pull a stain
You ain't gang, you need a pass to hang
'Fo I snatch yo chain
Murk your ass and catch a plane
Cuban Savage, I'm insane
I don't do no talkin' bitch
'Cuz there ain't nothin' to talk about
Pull up to the murder scene, bitches wanna talk it out
I'ma pull that choppa out, bullets make 'em walk it out
Now this bitch forgot about that gangsta shit you not about

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store

Fuck the opposite and fuck 12, man they ain't stoppin' shit
Hoes dick biting, if I had one, you'd be toppin' it
I'm droppin' shit
Yeah my name is molly, I ain't poppin' it
Four with a high tech and a Fanta, swear I'm high as shit
All these bitches lyin' talkin' 'bout they takin' trips
Rob yo hoe out the stick then I put 40 in yo bitch
I won't miss, like I'm swiping, nigga all my pieces hitting
I'll never trust a goofy, all you bitches counterfeit
I don't know why these bitches hate me, I don't never hate
Slide down yo block with the K and they bitches elevate
Say they put money on my head, well get it back bitch, I ain't dead
Yeah bitch that's what I said
Free my brother, fuck the feds

[Chorus: Cuban Doll]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches
We don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't yo mama at the corner store11Embed
