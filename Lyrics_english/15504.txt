I need you lyrics ["I need you" letter]

[Intro]
I love you I love you I love you
Real until death, did you hear baby?

[Verse 1]
Jesus has me thinking that night, that we made love
The devil has me thinking that night, that I lost your love
I lost you and lost my soul (soul)
The pain is killing me
I have not been able to reach heaven (UAH)
Because you have my heart (baby)
Gangster Love (Gangster Love)
Gangster Passion, Baby let me love you (uah)
Let me devour you (Baby), as in the time before
[Chorus]
Princess, I love you (I love you)
Baby, I need you (I need you)
And the more time passes (uah)
I still miss you (Uah-Uah)
My queen I love you (I love you)
Baby, I need you (I need you)
And time keeps running (running)
And I keep dying (agonizing), oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep alone (sleep alone)
In the arms of a strange and your memories do not leave (do not leave)
I remember my boxer polo
And you lying on my bed and Victoria Secret was your "hot pant" (baby)
DESCAME WHILE I ROME THE PHILLIE (ROMPO THE PHILLIE)
Drinking codeine with Jolly (with Jolly)
Ashes are where there was fire (uah)
You put me fool like Romeo (Romeo)
If it is real, tattoo my name (my name)
I promise you, I'm going to take you to London (to London)
What happened? I was always your man
Missing your gold hair and your copper eyes (uah)
If it is real tattoo my name (uah)
And back back and forget that man (uah)
Baby, look at it in the fixed eyes (uah)
And tell me that I am not the light of the eyes of your life

I love you I love you)
Baby, I need you (I need you)
And the more time passes (running)
I still miss you (agonizing)
My queen I love you, I need you (I love you, I love you)
And time keeps running
And I keep dying, uoh

[Verse 3]
The big buttocks and the Versace suit with the tacos (with the tacos)
Versace is my shirt, the belt and the shoes (the shoes)
Untouchable at Rolls Royce, with you and with Draco (BRR)
And first I and second you and then the devices
In the bonete is the trunk and behind is the engine (the engine)
What is love without happiness and without pain? (Without pain)
It suffers and laughs, but how rich heat (rich heat)
You on me, vulnerable and I make love to you (oh!)
Mommy you kill me and I bury myself inside you (oh!)
So rich that I don't get tired of loving you
Touching us on the phone, come for me (-te pa 'me)
Coming at the same time very rich until I left (-that I left)
Baby, speaking to my ear sexy, baby (oah)
I could never forget you (Oah)
Baby I keep waiting here (here)
With you to death, baby
[Chorus]
I love you, baby I need you
And the more time passes, the more I still miss you
My queen I love you (I love you)
Baby I need you (I love you, I love you)
And time keeps running, and I keep dying, oh-oh

[Outro]
(I love you, I love you, I love you, uoh-uoh)
Loving who does not love you is like throwing himself into a vacuum without wings, baby
But as long as there is hope, did you hear, Baby?
Real until death

The untouchables, the Illuminati, baby
(Uah, Uah, Baby) 1embed
