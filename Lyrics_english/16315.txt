A Penny for Your Thoughts Lyrics[Intro]
A penny for you thoughts
I've got to know where I stand
I just got to know where I am with you

[Chorus]
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
[Verse 1]
Walkin' holdin' hands, you say you're mine all mine
Then soon another face steals your eyes away
It's just a guessing game, and I can't help feelin' used
Love shouldn't be so darn confused

[Chorus]
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

[Verse 2]
People love to talk, they say you're usin' me
Though face to face you swear I'm the only one
If I had a crystal ball I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind

[Chorus]
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Girl, if I had a crystal ball (A crystal ball)
I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind

[Chorus]
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

[Chorus]
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (Hey, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me (You tell me you love me)
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
(Ooh, your thoughts, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
(Ooh, a kiss, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts (Only me, only me), a nickel for a kiss
(Just me) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)Embed
