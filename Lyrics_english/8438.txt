[Verse 1: Ivy Queen & Bad Bunny]
That no slim
The album turns on when I arrive (Yes, Fire)
I have the men from Hobby (the Queen)
A Malcri치 'like Nairobi (haha)
And you see me drinking from the bottle (Yes, Fire)
Breaking the street, I feel beautiful (ah)
Bobo that comes with the nebula (rra)
Of to 'it' I am incredulous (wuh)
She is single before it became fashionable (Ey)
Do not believe in love from "amorphoda" (no, no)
The DJ puts it, I enjoy it all
I climbed on the table and fucks (Rra, ey)
In Perreo it is not removed
Smokes and gets good loquita
Calls you if you need you
But for now there is Solita (Yes, Fire)

She perrea alone (she perrea alone, she perrea alone, alone)
He

Hey, she perrea alone (she perrea alone, she perrea alone, alone)
He
She perrea alone (she perrea alone)
She perrea alone (Yes, Fire)
