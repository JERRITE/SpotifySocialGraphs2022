Soul Lyricsen The bottom of the river is calm 
 In the passage of time the reason 
 But being with you my life 
 I feel better 
 The questions seem answers 
 And in your eyes a voice is heard 
 Nake yourself and make love 
 Like the blind 
 Without a modesty 
 Without realizing when the sun rises 
 Like birds without caution 
 You are what I always lacked 
 My good luck my peace 
 You are my fleeting star 
 You are much more than I ask 
 My soulmate my pair 
 My road at sea 
 You are my window to paradise 
 Like the blind 
 Without a modesty 
 Without realizing when the sun rises 
 Like birds without caution 
 You are what I always lacked 
 My good luck my peace might also likembed
