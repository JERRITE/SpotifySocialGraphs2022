Cripy Cripy Lyrics [Lyrics for "Cripy Cripy" FT. Shako]

[Intro: Shako]
Yeah, original remix
Yandar & Yostin, Shako Lgh, Ma, Yeh
And and 'Colombian, but it looks like Jamaican

[Chorus]
The girl wants Cryy, Cryy, Cryy
Because Happy, Happy, Happy
The girl wants Cryy, Cryy, Cryy
Because Happy, Happy, Happy
[Verse 1]
To order, woman, what is offered to you
We also have CRESPA (we have CRESPA)
Smoke what seems to you
That we are in confidence, do not be so modest
And he likes crypt and everything is absorbed
Then a lotion was made so that it does not sorry
Ask for a glass with water for dust
But when she smokes she doesn't hide
And her red eyes betray her
It shows above that he likes kills
He doesn't like Mari because it's very cheap
That's why she just wants

[Chorus]
The girl wants Cryy, Cryy, Cryy
Because Happy, Happy, Happy
The girl wants Cryy, Cryy, Cryy
Because Happy, Happy, Happy

[Post-car]
High, she doesn't want to regulate
He likes the special
She is an artificial girl
And flies, far fly away
Oh, to know his grandmother
Those small eyes that kill me
She gets crazy and I love it
She only with a plon opens her legs
If you combine it with alcohol, boot the lid
And you get crazy
For me you get sexy, sexy
I like so, Shhh! And don't say na '
YOU
