Never say Lyricsdavid Civera - never say
A winter afternoon
I found an old friend
We sat for a while and we talked
What we had lived

I asked him: What are you doing?
He told me: pulling
That in some aspects life
Had left him waiting
The light of his dreams went out
What he always wanted to do
Never say
Never say never...

Never say it's too late
Although everything seems unbearable
You never release the rope, life
Pushes you and gives you a new opportunity
Never say never
Never say never...

If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are ...

I asked him: What are you doing?
He told me: pulling
That in some aspects life
Had left him waiting

That the light of his dreams went out
What he always wanted to do
Never say
Never say never...
You might also like you say it's too late
Although everything seems unbearable
You never release the rope, life
Pushes you and gives you a new opportunity
Never say never
Never say never...

If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are ...

Never say it's too late
Although everything seems unbearable
You never release the rope, life
Pushes you and gives you a new opportunity
Never say never
Never say never...

If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are
If you are alive, you are ... embed
