When She Was Mine LyricsEverywhere I go
Everything I do
Reminds me of you
Just a picture on the wall
I'm surrounded by it all
Gotta walk before I fall
Yeah

Fall out
Out on the street
Streetlight
Light up for me
So far from where I used to be
When she was mine

Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good when she was mine
Wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Oh I wish I could forget
Forget when she was mine

Mine, yeah
When she was mine
Mine, yeah

What I miss the most
Is talking up all night
We laughed until we cried
Now I'm breaking at the seams
Dropping to my knees
Nothing left of me, no

Like stone
Turned into dust
My heart
Wasn't enough

When she was mine

Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good when she was mine
Wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Oh I wish I could forget
Forget when she was mine

Mine, yeah
When she was mine
Mine, yeah
When she was mine

Wonder if she's out there
Wonder where she goes, she goes yeah
Wonder what she's doing
Will I ever know?

Yeah

Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good when she was mine
Wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Oh I wish I could forget
Forget when she was mine
Mine, yeah
When she was mine
Mine, yeah

Down on my knees gotta see her
Gotta see her, gotta see her
Tryna forget but I need her
But I need her, but I need her
(repeat 2x)

When she was mineEmbed
