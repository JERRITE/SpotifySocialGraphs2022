Sobrio Lyrics [text of "sobrio" ft. Sfera Ebbasta]

[Refrain: Izi]
I don't do it as a sober
My between 'have sobri's face?
No, I don't think
Fra ', I like to cover me with maka
Which will soon
Give me a sip of purple
That I put it back on fire
If you are looking for me, I'm above
[Verse 1: izi]
You don't know I have a series of Kush in the closet
Try to ask Mario if I have a couple of pulles
The springs in the attic
I never know given and time
But I always look for a bit a bit what I miss
As if it were a card, no white paper
How I was a snake in the green of dawn
Traveling and kills in silence
I miss I know my name, the siento
There is Marietto and Sferone in the Temple
We check the most fatty Weeda that passes to the convent
Down by me Christians drink from the morning
Because there is no better to do
You come here, Fra 'in Galatina
That the syrup slowly rises
I am sheikh
Poor to make the rich
Which is from the poor that the rhythm comes
Big Boss Izi-Play bet on me as on Christ
That there is more religion on my album
There is no more religion but a wreck
I certainly glance me
You don't establish my straight line
Civil War, Kingston inside my cannons
The bombs throw them to those who are brillo
And to those who shine under the buildings

My between 'have sobri's face?
No, I don't think
Fra ', I like to cover me with maka
Which will soon
Give me a sip of purple
That I put it back on fire
If you are looking for me, I'm above

[Verse 2: Sfera Ebbasta]
I speak only of sluts and grams
You know I do this
A lot of between 'play with weapons
Until I see them at the news
Glass, smoke and exchange, this is the scene
Make me space that are on the rise
You are on the cock as a Romanian is
Like bad unexpected news
My Fra ', there is understood
In Pocket Cash, Banca Intesa
Intense smoke, ganja in shopping bags
No competition, Fra ', you hear the flowa flow
How does it arrive on the scene? It is a shuttle that flies to the sky
Leave the writing for the writing
And we started from scratch
But we are running on a black mercedes
Sfera Ebbasta, between Okay
Exchange goods, no eBay
I go out without a lira between but I go home with her
And you look like just out of a rave
I don't see the watch, I still drink a little
Maybe I'll come back later, but
[Refrain: Izi]
My between 'have sobri's face?
No, I don't think
Fra ', I like to cover me with maka
Which will soon
Give me a sip of purple
That I put it back on fire
If you are looking for me, I'm suprambed
