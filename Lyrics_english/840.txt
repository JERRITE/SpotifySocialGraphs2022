I refuse lyrics ["I refuse" letter]]

[Intro]
Ba-Ba-Babylon Girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon Girl
For all those loves that were forced to be separated
Ba-Ba-Babylon Girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon Girl
This song is for you

[Verse 1]
Tell me how I explain to my destiny that you are no longer there
Tell me how I will give off this frenzy
This madness I feel for you
With this chemistry you do in me
And I can't, girl, I can't, girl
[Pre-car]
Nena Disculpame if I excited you I didn't want to do it
I know that in love when that is real, come back (come back, come back)
But how to forget your skin and how to forget a woman
I can't, Girl, I can't, Girl

[Chorus]
Baby, no (baby, no)
I refuse to give you a last kiss so keep it (guádalo)
So that next time I will do it (doing it)
Doing it like this, so
Just as you like, baby

[Verse 2]
Without looking back, without looking for anyone else
I just want to be with you, wouh
If I don't have you here with me, I don't want to be your friend
Because you are my path, wouh
And I just want to be with you
Baby, please understand him
Just give me your hand and trust me
If you miss just my voice
And give him time (time), mommy, at the same time (time)
That you, that I, are made to be both
And give him time (time), baby, at the same time (time)
That you and me, that you and me
We are made to be both

[Chorus]
Baby no
Baby, no (baby, no)
I refuse to give you a last kiss so keep it (guádalo)

So that next time I will do it to you
Doing so, so
Just as you like Baby20embed
