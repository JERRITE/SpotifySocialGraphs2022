La Belle Femme Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight, I’ve fallen victim
In my head, to what could’ve been
Thinking too much and too often
About you, again
If I knocked would you let me in
I’m a fool, again
If I knocked would you let me in

[Chorus]
What I would do if I was with you
In the other room
Dreaming of you, is all I can do
From the other room
[Verse 2]
Be still, my beating heart
Won’t you beat for another?
You’re a work of art
I wanna swim in your colors again
If I knocked would you let me in?
I’m a fool again
If I knocked would you let me in?

[Chorus [x2]]
What I would do if I was with you
In the other room
Dreaming of you is all I can do
From the other room
What I would do if I was with you
In the other room
Dreaming of you is all I can do
From the other room

[Bridge]
If you were alone, I’d try
If you were alone, I’d try
If you were alone, I’d try
If you were alone, I’d try
You might also like[Chorus]
What I would do if I was with you
In the other room
Dreaming of you is all I can do
From the other room2Embed
