Deeper into You LyricsI feel it eating in me
While you still drown me
And cross the line over and over again
It's all around me
Now I'm here cause of you

Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
Deeper into you
Time to pity myself
I can't let me cross the line for her
I'm not me when I dream
There's someone else in me
That I fear cause of you

Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
Deeper into you

I'm not me when I dream
I'm not me when I dream
Anymore
Cause of you
Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
I'm falling out cause of you
Now I'm falling
Deeper into youYou might also likeEmbed
