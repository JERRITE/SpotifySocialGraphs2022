I love you more lyrics [verse 1: tini]
You, you suddenly arrived, it is you
You didn't care about people and we were two
I just heard your voice, it's always you, uh-oh
And that's how I am
And although it was soon to talk about love
I'm sorry, but I couldn't hide
What is so easy to see, so I was me, uh-oh

[Choir: Tini, Nacho, both]
You gave me a kiss and ay ay ay
And I confess that ay ay ay
Only in a second (OH)
You returned the world (OH)
That's why I want more
I love you more, I love you more
With your gaze ay ay (ay, with your gaze)
Without saying anything ay ay (oh, without saying anything)
You left me quiet, lost, in love
That's why I want more
I love you more, I love you more
[Verse 2: Nacho]
Give me that aroma in your skin
Let my lips sweeten
Slowly lose me in your honey kisses
Sed√∫ce me
Remove the reins of the steed of desire and sele faithful
To the desire to give me your being
And I will make you my wife, many times I will make you my wife
Oh, since I saw you invades me a great feeling
It was like a strange emotion
As butterflies looking for color in my heart
It was like a rain of love
Each drop was an illusion
And in your waters I lost reason

[Choir: Tini, Nacho, both]
You gave me a kiss and ay ay (ay)
And I confess that ay ay ay
Only in a second (OH)
You returned the world (OH)
That's why I want more
I love you more, I love you more
With your gaze ay ay (Yeah) (Oh, with your gaze)
Without saying anything ay ay (oh, without saying anything)
You left me quiet (oh)
Lost, in love (OH)
That's why I want more
I love you more, I love you more

[Bridge: Tini, Nacho]
You, you suddenly arrived, it is you
You didn't care about people and we were two
I just heard your voice, it's always you (UH-OH)

[Choir: Tini, Nacho, both]
You gave me a kiss and ay ay ay
And I confess that ay ay ay
Only in a second (OH)
You returned the world (OH)

I love you more, I love you more
With your gaze ay ay (Yeah) (Oh, with your gaze)
Without saying anything ay ay (oh) (oh, without saying anything)
You left me quiet, lost, in love
That's why I want more
