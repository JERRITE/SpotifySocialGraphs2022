Out in the Country Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whenever I need to leave it all behind
Or feel the need to get away
I find a quiet place, far from the human race
Out in the country

[Chorus]
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
[Verse 2]
Whenever I feel them closing in on me
Or need a bit of room to move
When life becomes too fast, I find relief at last
Out in the country

[Chorus]
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttimeYou might also likeEmbed
