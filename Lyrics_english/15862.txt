Forever Lyrics ["Forever" ft letter. Dollar]

[Chorus: Dollar & Rels B]
And I will remember, he
If you stay with mine 'next to me, I will not fail you, he
If you need anything from me I will give it to you, he
Ask for everything you want to ask for
Now and always, EH-EH-EY
Now and always, IEEH (Yes Sir)
I will remember, ey (ah)
If you stay with mine 'next to me, I will not fail you, ey (no)
If you need something of me I will give it to you, ey (aja-ah)
Ask for everything you want 'ask
Now and always
Now and always, IEEH (Yes, AH)
[Verse: relas b & dollar]
The times I have failed I have asked forgiveness (OH)
Only once I have loved, really, from heart
Some that have passed have been without a condom
LOOK SKINNY FLAKKO, THE NU user has a gift
Take from my hand and go together to the million
That to's those rappers know who is the best (oh)
I have lungs and kidney resentful
Guilt of that lemon and to give tail to the rum, ah
He pointed to me with bad intention (OH)
I have my own style, whore, I am not clone of the other clone
I don't believe in God, my family is my religion
I pray to 'days before the sun goes
Those kids have lost (oh
Because of the drug and women who charge you 100 ooh)
You are nobody, cousin, don't try to convince me
If you give me it, you have to pay the rent (OH-OH)
I have four houses in my mind to buy (OH)
One in Puerto Rico, yes, another in Canada (Oh; Oh)
A pa 'that runs the child and does not lack na'
The other will let his mother decide

[Choir: Dollar, RELS B]
And I will remember, ey (aja-ah)
If you stay with mine 'next to me, I will not fail you, ey (no)
If you need something of me I will give it to you, ey (how is it?)
Ask for everything you want to ask for
Now and always, EH-EH-EY
Now and always, IEEH (AH)
I will remember, he
If you stay with mine 'next to me, I will not fail you, he
If you need anything from me I will give it to you, he
Ask for everything you want 'ask
Now and always, EH-EH-EH
Now and always, IEEH-EH-EYUU MIGHT ALSO LIKE3EMBED
