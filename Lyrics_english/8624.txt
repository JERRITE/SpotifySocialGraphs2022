Wrack My Brain Lyrics[Chorus]
Wrack my brain
Wrack my brain
Till my head's filled with pain
Wrack my brain

[Verse 1]
All dried up
I'm all dried up
All I have's this empty cup
All dried up
[Verse 2]
What I have, you don't want
What you want, I can't give
I got out of touch with you and yours
The way that you live

[Chorus]
I try to do
My best for you
While the sky pours down the rain
Wrack my brain

[Bridge]
Wrack my brain
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
With a will, there's a way
But there's no way I can see
Coming up with something you'd enjoy
As much as TV

[Verse 4]
All the same
I play the game
Up and down old memory lane
Wrack my brain
You might also like[Outro]
Till my head is filled with pain
Wrack my brain
While I slowly go insane
Wrack my brainEmbed
