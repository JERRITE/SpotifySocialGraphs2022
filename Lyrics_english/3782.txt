Empty City Lyrics [Verse 1: Yoon Jong Shin]
I'm walking empty
In the sidewalk block that steams
How will it look so empty
Did you go on vacation
This year's farewell is Summer
Last year, Summer was excited with you
Where did you go to play again Summer
HOT City

[Verse 2: Yoon Jong Shin]
All right, all right sweaty armpits
I got the deodorant
Good luck, good luck
Leave Hot City and definitely catch
New Love New Face, face
[Chorus: Yoon Jong Shin]
I will soon cover up
Cover it with my new face
Frida Frida Prida
Frida Frida from you
Cover
Cover with my new face
Frida Frida Prida
Frida Frida from you

[Verse 3: Gaeko]
The distance without you
If I knew it would be so refreshing, I summarized it
The relationship with you is choked than fine dust
It was when it rained once
The end of the drought is blooming
I want to go around every corner of the city
Like a toothpick after meals
Like a dog
Like my turn
I poured a drink and asked a cigarette
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
10 Bands, 50 Bands I don't know
I have loosened some of my money now
Even if the work is released and the fragrance is not sprayed
Cool is full of grass (grass pool)
It was a bit fierce, I and I and I and I and Freyda
I am now free man in other words.
(Spend my money tonight
With My New Honey Tonight
Everything is dead, I will burn all of this empty city.
Burn the City Tonight
Burn the City Tonight

What did you leave
Frenzy Heart & City is Empty
EMPTY CITY in the corner of that road
I'll throw it away
All Dry, All Dry My heart
Gold straight
I ’ll tree I’ ll try this Empty City
A person who will leave with me
Where where are you

[Chorus: Yoon Jong Shin]
I will soon cover up
Cover it with my new face
Frida Frida Prida
Frida Frida from you
Cover
Cover with my new face
Frida Frida Prida
Frida Frida from you

[Verse 5: Gaeko]
I'm not lonely, this empty distance is Hell No Hell NO
I'm practicing minimalism in my heart hell yeah hell yeah
I'm going to leave tomorrow.
I'm going to hide with a bunker, so don't find me
Ticket Done already regret none
Come back to my masculinity that I lost
I can't see me even if I wish both hands like Paris
Perhaps I'm a nice meal in paris
Good luck and finding me will be hard and hard
It's like a snow country train Ed Harris
Spend My Money Tomorrow
With My New Honey Not Alone
Throw everything away and this empty city
[OUTRO: Yoon Jong Shin & Gaeko]
I'm going to leave
