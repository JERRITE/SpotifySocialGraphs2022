Till the Rivers All Run Dry Lyrics[Chorus]
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you

[Verse]
I know sometimes you may wonder
From little things I say and do
But there's no need for you to wonder
If I need you, 'cause I'll need you
[Chorus]
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing you

[Verse]
Too many times I don't tell you
Too many things get in the way
And even though sometimes I hurt you
Still you show me, in every way

[Chorus]
Till the rivers all run dry
Till the sun falls from the sky
Till life on earth is through
I'll be needing youYou might also likeEmbed
