TranslationsDanskPermanent Lyrics[Verse 1]
You just, you made it look easy
It's like you didn't feel it
Not like I do
I followed, I followed the pieces
I tried to receive it
To when it was new

[Chorus]
Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both didn't mean it
And we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
[Verse 2]
I'll bet, I'll bet you're in Soho
Dancing in slow-mo
With someone new, oh
I can't lie, I hope you'll never forget it
And that you still wear it
Like all your tattoos

[Chorus]
Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both didn't mean it
And we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent

[Outro]
Permanent

Permanent
For a moment there
It was permanentYou might also like4Embed
