How good you look Lyrics [letter of "that good you look"]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro]
Yeh
Ra 'rauw
Ra ’rauw
Haha

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
How well you look
Where does your beauty come from?
My mind does not process
Give me your nakedness
What does your body have?
From prison my condemnation is for you
Mommy, how well you look
Where does your beauty come from?
My mind does not process
Give me your nakedness
What does your body have?
From prison my condemnation is for you

[Post-Coro: Rauw Alejandro]
Mommy, how well you look
How well you look
How well you look
How well you look
How well you look

[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro]
A snapchat sends me, seducing me (ey)
The lotus took me out
Ninfomaniá e '(JA)
Here whip 'A ’Bad Girl' (Wuh)
Give him punishment like the Father (AH)
Tell me if the motel falls
That this beautiful has to solve
Brought the rope, so that tie it
To bed, and when the time comes (ey)
That will kill her, even if I pray
That forgive her and put conditions
Now get well and do what I mentioned (Yah!)
