Cause and effect Lyrics [verse 1]
You want to govern my heart
My silence and my breathing
You think that even in dreams I will be able to live without you
I warn you, it doesn't work like this

[Verse 2]
You lie and you think so special
You dream that you make me glass
Run more hurry, kilometers from here
Today say goodbye touches me
[Chorus]
You know that although you thought perfect
By the Law of Cause and Effect
Today you pay for each error
Look that my love ignites you and cools you
Like an illusion that spies you
And it entangles you for fun, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Change the strategy, please
I don't get along with pain
I believe in the energy that moves spiral
And living in war makes me bad

[Chorus]
You know that although you thought perfect
By the Law of Cause and Effect
Today you pay for each error
Look that my love ignites you and cools you
Like an illusion that spies you
And he entangles you for fun, oh-oh

[Bridge]
In this skin duel against skin
I turn luck and it's your turn to lose
You Might Also Like [Choir]
That although you thought perfect
By the Law of Cause and Effect
Today you pay for each error
Look that my love ignites you and cools you
Like an illusion that spies you
And tangles you for fun

[Outro]
You know that although you thought perfect
By the Law of Cause and Effect
(Today you pay) today
(Today you pay) today you pay for each error
