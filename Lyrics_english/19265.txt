Envision Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, woah, yeah
(Woah, keep it up, Gavin)
(Where is Danny anyways?)
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Goddamn, you act so different
When you get held, it's not what I envisioned
Lust or love, you don't know the difference
Wonder why I'm so goddamn significant
[Chorus]
I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high (Yeah)
I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high

[Verse 1]
High as hell
She said that she love me, I can't tell
Knew that lil' bitch was dummy, I prevail
Why that nigga talkin' shit? You weren't fuckin' there
I just pulled up with the stick, blast it at him, yеah
I'm so high, I don't think that I fuckin' care
I'm so high, I don't think that there's no onе there
I get by smokin' gas. that's what I inhale
Someone get me out of here
Shawty tell me she wouldn't fall, fall, then she fuckin' fell
Why that bitch keep trippin', call, call, then you never there
I just gettin' money, ha, ha, throw it in the air
Why these niggas mad [?]? Guess that shit ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
Goddamn, you act so different
When you get held, it's not what I envisioned
Lust or love, you don't know the difference
Wonder why I'm so goddamn significant

I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high (Yeah)
I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high

[Verse 2]
Whole new world you discovered
You're one of my seven wonders
Earth ain't bound on your honor
I won't heal 'til I find her
Whole new world you discovered
You're one of my seven wonders
Earth ain't bound on your honor
I won't heal 'til I find her

[Chorus]
I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high (Yeah)
I tried, I'm not alright
At night I hope I vibe
I cry, without you I die
I fly, fuck it, I'm high1Embed
