You burn me Lyricsfeat. People from Zona & Los Cadillac's
That the temperature rises to me I like to burn with your heat, heat!
There is no doubt that I touch Tur if he has a taste, flavor!
Your body is like a sculpture and your smell fascinates me, your smell!
Your skin has a great texture rose by the sun ..
You burn me, you burn me, you burn me, the fire in my veins puts me to dance (you burn me)
You burn me, you burn me, you burn me, the fire in my veins puts me to dance ...
He starts dancing, with being the owner of your waist
Your fire is burning me, that the temperature rises
What a rise! that rises the temperature (climbing)
The temperature rises (which rises)
RAISE THE TEMPERATURE (RECATING)
The temperature rises! oh oh oh oh woh woh oh oh that up
The temperature rises! oh oh oh oh woh woh oh oh that up

This aim of exploiting that thermometer
The candle already feels kilometer
Atomic heat until we burned
And is that feeling your burning body is unusual
Nena is that you have that focus that burns me
Give me your sweat to me drunk and poisons me
Brunette ta good ...
You know what I like when you walk
And the passing wind plays with your skirt
You know that I like mommy I fascinates me
The skin that covers the neckline on your back
I would give everything I have, everything I can for having you
It is worth what you are worth, because you stay here with me
Yes ! And you don't get out of my heart
You burn me, you burn me, you burn me, the fire in my veins puts me to dance (you burn me)
You burn me, you burn me, you burn me, the fire in my veins puts me to dance ...
