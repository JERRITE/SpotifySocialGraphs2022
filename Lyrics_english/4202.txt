Upload the video, parabicho 'on purpose (Jah)
I don't even kiss you when a little piece is released
Of that cupcake, ey ​​(says)
I take you for the shell if he does not want 'in the ok (no)
He asks for milk and not e 'pa'l corn flakes (ah)
Wants Taki-Taki but my snake (UH)
Today fucks, today is fornica
He doesn't want anything serious, he doesn't complicate
She perreating while the PAI preaches (Woh, Ey)
Is that the dembow sounds and the ass pica, ah

To the most bicha, richitilla, guaynabicha
The only one who knows how to move the file
Go with Daddy's visa, paralyz

Bottle `` and whiskey, molly-molly, tussi

I do one hundred thousand and I don't bounce a penny

Two pound 'from Weed, bottle' 'and whiskey
Molly-Molly, Tussi, Molly-Molly, Tussi
Two pound 'from Weed, bottle' 'and whiskey
