Donâ€™t Fight It Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have no other way
There is a price to pay
For what the man will say
That I was a million miles away
In a promise full of steam
It could take no vacant dream
To persuade me to believe

[Chorus]
I think, just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
I think, just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
[Verse 2]
I left my heart in places
Forgot every one of their faces
And tried to navigate a broken path
Of which I may have helped create
In any incident, this is never no accident
To stand alone
And let the silence make itself at home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, give it up
Those dirty tricks
No quick fix can undo it
Ah, give it up
I won't resist
My answer's always this

[Chorus]
I said, don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
Just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is

Where has my light gone?
Where has my fight gone?
What keeps us burning when the fire is long gone?
When I can't relate
To that voice without a face
Should I be afraid, or is it just a voice I did create?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, give it up
Those dirty tricks
No quick fix can undo it
Ah, give it up
I won't resist
My answers always this

[Chorus]
I said, don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
Just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
Just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
Just don't fight it
Don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is
If you don't know what it is
[Outro]
No, don't fight it
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is
No, don't fight it
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is
No, don't fight it
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it isEmbed
