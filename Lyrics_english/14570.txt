In your eyes Lyrics [Verse 1] 
 Did you try to deny 
 Sincerity of my heart to you 
 How I interrupted 
 Get a sue of love 

 [VERSE 2] 
 Are you unable to determine 
 Between glass and gems 
 How you are 
 Forced me to resign 
 [Chorus] 
 And I shouldn't be 
 Meet yourself in this world 
 And you throw myself as you wish 
 And choose him 
 And I led this 
 Lamenting the heart that has been injured 
 I have the same how Hinnyanya 
 I'm in your eyes 

 [Bridge] 
 But if I are needed, and accepted 
 Let me collect your love 
 But if I was rejected, it was not necessary 
 Throw everything about me 

 [Chorus] 
 And I shouldn't be 
 Meet yourself in this world 
 And you throw myself as you wish 
 And choose him 
 And I led this 
 Lamenting the heart that has been injured 
 I have the same how Hinnyanya
