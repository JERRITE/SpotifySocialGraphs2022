Bonita Applebum Lyrics[Intro: Q-Tip]
Do I love you?
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because I do the two?
Can you let me know
Right now, please
Bonita Applebum

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita
[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Hey, Bonita, glad to meet ya (Heh)
For the cunning, stunning you, miss, I must beseech ya (Mmh)
Hey, being with you is a top priority
Ain't no need to question the authority (Mhm)
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections (Hm)
You got mine's to swing in your direction
Hey, you're like a hip-hop song, you know? (Heh-heh)
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
38-24-37 (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven *kissing*
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't (Listen up)
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't (Mhm)
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics
So far, I hope you like rap songs
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
You might also like[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, I said you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita

[Interlude into "Can I Kick It?"]
Ayo, who’s having a ball?
And you know, they ask me to get on the mic
And they ask me
Can I kick it? Word (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you—)41Embed
