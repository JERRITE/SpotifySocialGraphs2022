Stupid Deep Lyrics[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done, yeah
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep
Stupid deep

[Verse]
What if where I've tried to go was always here?
And the path I've tried to cut was always clear?
Why has life become a plan, yeah
To put some money in my hand?
When the love I really need is stupid cheap
Stupid cheap
[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep
Oh, stupid deep

[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done (What if all the things I've done)
Were just attempts at earning love?
But the hole inside my heart is stupid deep
Oh, stupid deep

[Outro]
