So long Lyrics ["Lyrics for so long" ft. Paolo Pimp]

[Enter: Baby Jey]
I haven't known anything about you
I know you've learned many things about me
And I know, baby, I will feel again
I await your call in case you love you 'come

[Chorus: Baby Jey]
Drink, tell me where and when, I'm going to make the pressure feel
What emotion to repeat that night when we fugamo 'and nobody saw us
The note crazy you
Baby, tell me where and when, I'm going to make the pressure feel
What emotion to repeat that night when we fugamo 'and nobody saw us
The note crazy you
[Post-Stribillo: Baby Jey & Paolo Pimp]
So see 'what I speak? A devil caught you
A macabre perreo, I want to see you, give it to me
In the bed I am looking for ', imagining what' tamo 'transporting, oh (p-a-o-l-o)

[Verse 1: Paolo Pimp]
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno', pa 'get pressure
'Toy addicted to your' networks, baby, give me tension
If at night and 'a movie with you with action
I do not avoid problem for you, I come from the warmth (yes)
When I kiss you on the mouth I feel like a child
You left me wrapped and I need your love
She likes the movie, the movie was manufactured
There is money in the glove compartment, but I never specify (OH-OH, OH)

[Bridge: Paolo Pimp]
I remember them 'they don't forget the posses' that he made to you (ah)
Nor the face 'that put' (ah), I have not seen na 'like you (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You were born for me to make you mine
Give it that I stay up
God bless your ass but, baby, give me lu '
Your ass does not forget the posses
Nor the face 'that put' (ah), I have not seen na 'like you (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You were born for me to make you mine
Give it that I stay up
God bless your ass but, baby, give me lu '

[Verse 2: Baby Jey]
Time escapes as if he were going to kill him
If it were so easy I would be kissing you
How much gu-, I see that he is liking you (—ndo)
And I keep killing (—ndo), keep forgetting (—Dando, oh)
Then tell me, baby, when and where
If I appear in your life, baby, do not astonish you '
I know well that you don't need any man
But I know what hides'
I don't even know for you '
Vamo 'A Verno'
In the same bed someday vamo 'to do it
Your body inside I will possess it '
Your movement 'to read it
Ambo 'knows' how he dances' in hell
To hide it
Where no one can see '
Tell me when I wathe 'to do it
[Chorus: Paolo Pimp & Baby Jey]
Drink, tell me where and when, I'm going to make the pressure feel
What emotion to repeat that night when we fugamo 'and nobody saw us
The note crazy you
Baby, tell me where and when, I'm going to make the pressure feel
What emotion to repeat that night when we fugamo 'and nobody saw us
The note crazy you
