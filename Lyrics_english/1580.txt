No matter what - acoustic LyricsCause i need you, right here, by my side
Cause you're everything i'm not, in my life
We're indestructable, we are untouchable
Nothing can take us down tonight
You are so beautiful, it should be criminal
You should be mine
And if we make it out alive
I promise you that we will never die!
No matter what, i got your back
I'll take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god, we'll be okay
So believe me when i say, you're the one
They'll never forgive us for the things we've done
No way to justify, we got no alibi
We are alive, we're on the run
Just put your hand in mine
It shouldn't be a crime, what have we done?
And if we make it through the night
I promise you this love will never die!
No matter what, i got your back
I'll take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god, we'll be okay
But if we die, before we wake
I'll promise you forever and my soul today
No matter what, we'll be okay
Everybody said that we would never last
If they could see us now i bet they'd take it back
It doesn't matter what we do or what we say
Cause nothing matters anyway!
No matter what, i got your back
I'll take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god, we'll be okay
And if we die before we wake
I'll promise you forever and my soul today
No matter what, we'll be okay!You might also likeEmbed
