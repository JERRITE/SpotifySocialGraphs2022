Jaguar Lyrics[Chorus]
Supersonic pussycat
Just like a jaguar, silky black
So let me climb your wood like that
You got nine times to come hit that
La-la-la (Come hit that)
La-la-la
Supersonic pussycat
Just like a jaguar, silky black
So let me climb your wood like that
You got nine times to come hit that
La-la-la (Come hit that)
La-la-la
[Verse]
Walked by so fly, I made sure I took my time
(Tell me, did you notice?)
Hoping you'll remember me
We met in a fantasy
(Tell me, did you notice–)

[Pre-Chorus]
That I'm a little bit curious 'bout the way you feel
And I've never been scared to keep it real?
How could you blame me?
I'm just living on instinct, that's the way I feel
And I want you to know you got that thrill that I like
I want that jungle kind of love

[Chorus]
Supersonic pussycat
Just like a jaguar, silky black
So let me climb your wood like that
You got nine times to come hit that
La-la-la (Come hit that)
La-la-la

[Post-Chorus]
Let's get wild, let's get wild
Let's get wild, let's get wild
(Just like we're supersonic)
You might also like[Chorus]
Supersonic pussycat
Just like a jaguar, silky black
So let me climb your wood like that
You got nine times to come hit that
La-la-la (Come hit that)
La-la-la (Just like we're supersonic)7Embed
