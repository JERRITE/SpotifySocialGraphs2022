Falling Apart (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wonder what it's gonna take
To fix this feeling
Too many hours in a day
Wasted on daydreams
Of somebody that I can lean on
Holds me up when I don't feel strong
I got a lot of empty space
Savin' it for something

[Pre-Chorus]
But each night, I'm on my own
I'm closer to a breakdown
Tell me, 'cause I donâ€™t know
And I'm tired of being let down
[Chorus]
My heart is getting heavy from hoping
And it's got a lot of battle scars
I kinda wish somebody had told me
That this was gonna be so hard
And maybe I was made to be lonely
'Cause I'm standing here with open arms
Oh, I just want somebody to hold me
When I'm falling apart

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm falling apart
When I'm falling apart

[Verse 2]
And all the shadows that I hide
I wish that I could show them
Could you bring a little light
And see where I've been broken?
Not lookin' for you to fix me
Just want someone to do this with me
Tired of keeping it inside
All these words unspoken

[Pre-Chorus]
But each night, I'm on my own
I'm closer to a breakdown
Tell me, 'cause I don't know
And I'm tired of being let down
You might also like[Chorus]
My heart is getting heavy from hoping
And it's got a lot of battle scars
I kinda wish somebody had told me
That this was gonna be so hard
And maybe I was made to be lonely
'Cause I'm standing here with open arms
Oh, I just want somebody to hold me
When I'm falling apart

[Outro]
When I'm falling apart
When I'm falling apartEmbed
