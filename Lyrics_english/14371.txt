Same Jeans Lyrics[Verse 1: Kyle Falconer]
I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down
Life's one big circle, and it does end
When it ends, will you still be my friend?
I'm not making a fool of myself
Oh, tell me I'm not making a fool of myself, so

[Chorus]
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
That shit's made your head spin around
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground
[Verse 2]
I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down
I take my hat off to the busker man
When he's drowned all his sorrows in singing song
Not everything has worked out to plan
But believe me, he's smiling as long as he can, so

[Chorus]
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you some prick that you don't know
That shit's made your head spin around
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

[Verse 3]
I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down
My mind's not perfect but it's sincere
You'd be amazed at what you can achieve in a year
Say you tried so hard, but your heart's on a switch
And I know you tried so hard, but your heart's on a switch, so

[Chorus]
When you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
That shit's made your head spin around
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground
So, when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
That shit's made your head spin around
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

Same jeans on for four days now, everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down
I'm not making a fool of myself
Now, believe me, baby, I can tell
Same jeans on for four days now, everybody's dressing up, I'm dressing down
I'm not making a fool of myself
Believe me, baby, I can tellEmbed
