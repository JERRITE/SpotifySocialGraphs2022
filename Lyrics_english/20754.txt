Taking You Home Lyrics[Intro]
Can I talk to you, baby?
Can I talk to you, baby?
Oh...

[Verse 1]
As she stepped down off the train yesterday, in the pouring rain...
With her clothes all packed, her face messed up, I could tell she was feeling pain
I thought I had something sweet to tell her as I opened up my umbrella
She was so confused, scared and abused, trying to hide it with a smile
[Hook]
And just like a knight in shining armor...
I used my charm just to calm her
Engaged her in a good conversation
Just trying to ease her frustration
As she told me her story...
I told her, "Baby, nuh worry...
I'm the man that you looking for
Baby, count you're lucky stars"

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm taking you home with me tonight
You're gonna stay with me for life
I'm taking you home with me tonight
Cause I'm a lover, baby, I won't fight

[Verse 2]
She said, she didn't know where she was going
All she know, she had to leave him fast
'Cause if she didn't leave, she didn't know how long she was gonna last
So many times he told her, "Sorry"
So many time he said he'd stop
But he goes on and on, her mind's made up, she said she ain't going back

[Hook]
And just like a knight in shining armor...
I used my charm just to calm her
Engaged her in a good conversation
Just trying to ease her frustration
As she told me her story...
I told her, "Baby, nuh worry...
I'm the man that you looking for
Baby, count you're lucky stars"

'Cause I'm taking you home with me tonight
You're gonna stay with me for life
I'm taking you home with me tonight
Cause I'm a lover, baby, I won't fight

[Interlude]
I won't fight you, baby!
Yeah
I'm gonna take care of you, baby
Gonna take care of you, lady
Ahhh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh, yeah
Yeah
Ahh

[Hook]
And just like a knight in shining armor...
I used my charm just to calm her
Engaged her in a good conversation
Just trying to ease her frustration
As she told me her story...
I told her, "Baby, nuh worry...
I'm the man that you looking for
I could be your shining star"
[Chorus: (2X)]
'Cause I'm taking you home with me tonight
You're gonna stay with me for life
I'm taking you home with me tonight
Cause I'm a lover, baby, I won't fight

[Outro]
I won't fight you, baby...Embed
