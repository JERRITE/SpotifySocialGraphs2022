TranslationsفارسیTürkçeEnglishI Love You’s Lyrics[Intro]
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee

[Verse 1]
Where do I begin? I'm sittin' here jaded
Yeah, I fell asleep with the makeup still all on my skin
Wide awake again, I'm prayin' I make it
I'm steppin' the twelve, but it's somewhere I've already been
[Pre-Chorus]
Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up, it's bad for my heart
My heart

[Chorus]
So, no more I love you's
It's too easy to say, yeah
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay, yeah
I blamed it on the time zones
I blamed it on my eyes closed
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'll face my sins and I wish it was easy
Now I fall asleep with the light on, but still without you
So I'll make amends and I'll buy myself flowers
And then, when they die, I'll be happy that they got me through

[Pre-Chorus]
Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up it's bad for my heart
My heart
You might also like[Chorus]
So, no more I love you's
It's too easy to say, yeah
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay, yeah
I blamed it on the time zones
I blamed it on my eyes closed
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay

[Bridge]
It's not on my lips and I love it
No weight on my chest, I'm above it
I'm taking a moment to cut it out (Oh)
I feel my conscience is callin'
Now there's no fear, no more runnin'
I don't want words that mean nothin', no

[Chorus]
Oh, no more I love you's (No, no more I love you's)
It's too easy to say, yeah (I know it's too easy to say)
No more I love you's (No)
Until I'm okay (Until I'm okay), yeah
I blamed it on the time zones (Oh)
I blamed it on my eyes closed (Eyes closed)
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's (Ooh, no)
Until I'm okay (Until I'm okay)11Embed
