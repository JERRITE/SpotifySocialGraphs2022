If you see it lyricsssi you will tell him that
You have seen me improved
And that there is someone by my side
Who has me in love
That the days have passed
And I haven't given myself
That has not taken my dream
And that ours is forgotten
Tell him that I am very good
I've ever been better
If you think maybe I'm dying
Because she is not, who goes
Tell him at the end of everything
I will be grateful
Although thinking about it
Better tell him that, you don't see me
If you see her tell him that I no longer wait for his call
And that I no longer wake up
In the early morning
And I don't remember her anymore
And that I no longer need
Tell me I'm already cured
And that ours is already past
Tell him that I am very good, (I'm very good)
I've ever been better, (better)
If you think that maybe I die because she is not going
Tell him at the end of everything
I will be grateful
Although thinking about it better tell him, you don't see me
That I have lost and that I will not return
And tell him too
That although I call me I will not answer
If you see her
And tell him that I am very good (although I know very well that no)
I've ever been better (lies a bit please)
If you think that maybe I die because she is not going
Tell him at the end of everything (don't keep lying)
I will be grateful
Although thinking about it better tell him that you no longer see me
Tell him that I am very good, (although I know very well)
I have never been better, (lies a bit in my favor)
If you think that maybe I die because she is not going
Tell him at the end of everything (don't keep lying)
I will be grateful
Although thinking about it better tell him that I no longer see me might also likembed
