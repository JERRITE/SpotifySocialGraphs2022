Needles & Pins Lyrics[Verse 1: Canyon City]
I woke up before the sun rose
Did my best to walk on tip toes
Needles and pins
‘Cause if you heard the way I pace around this room your mind would race for the reasons and sins
I never learned to wear a tie and go to work and tell you lies like everything's ok
Though sometimes it is for a little while
And I can live in between those smiles
And patiently wait

[Chorus: Canyon City]
When it feels like home where you can't be found ‘cause she haunts the alone and you need her now
Revered like gold in your plastic crown when your kingdom falls and you lay it down
Before the next breath you need the grace
To breathe out
[Verse 2: Canyon City]
I've been talking faster I've been
Looking for distraction trying to loosen up some days
Ain’t it funny how we can't remember
Most our lives while a few words never mercifully fade
So I beg you honey take some pictures
Frame them hang them high and let's set fire to the room
‘Cause I think I like the lighting better when it's wrapped up and burning time like sweaters for your cold winter blue

[Chorus: Canyon City]
When it feels like home where you can't be found ‘cause she haunts the alone and you need her now
Revered like gold in your plastic crown when your kingdom falls and you lay it down
Before the next breathe you need the grace
To breathe out

[Bridge: Canyon City]
Oh have I lost some keys in the dust as I cleaned up
Oh don't it always seem to come as you let go

[Chorus: Canyon City]
When it feels like home where you can't be found ‘cause she haunts the alone and you need her now
Revered like gold in your plastic crown when your kingdom falls and you lay it down
Before the next breathe you need the grace
Before the next breathe you need the grace
To breathe out
