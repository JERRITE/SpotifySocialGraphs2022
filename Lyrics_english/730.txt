Oh, OH-OH, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, YEH-YEH
Baby, if it's for me, I stay
With you to'a the full night
But what is what you are afraid of? (Bryant Myers)
Baby, vamo 'to do it until dawn
You want to 'keep it a secret
And I don't care that the world knows
You know 'that since I heat you
I am the owner 'e your body, Baby
[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
Do not go yet
Stay a little longer, a little longer, baby
Do not go yet
Stay a little longer, a little longer, baby

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
Before you go, baby, give me another chupop (Yeh)
Your mouth and your eye 'have a plot
If you want ', I stop time with my hublot (Yeh)
Tell me what time your clock says, baby (rrr)
That ass fills a choliseo
Killing the league since the time 'that Luian did the' mixo '
My chains shine like the sun
If you want ', I let me give you and I bronze you
Chining You and I Somo 'El Dream Team (Yeh)
He always asks me more like ovaltine
You and I mize 'as a strawberry with whipped cream (Yeh, Yeh)
Like Louis Vuitton with the supreme
Get out of WhatsApp, that your boyfriend does not catch you online (online)
If he asks you, tell him that today you work 'overtime (overtime)
His visa always decline
And I in the suite with you doing the busta rhymes, baby

[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Bad Bunny]
Do not go yet
Stay a little longer, a little longer, baby
Do not go yet
Stay a little longer, a little longer

I'm really tired
But before you go ', vamo' pa'l second
Give him, vamo 'A Dawn with'
