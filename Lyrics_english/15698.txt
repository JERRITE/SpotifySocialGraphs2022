[Chorus: the alpha]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
Yo-yo-yo I'm your daddy, you are my mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami
[Post-Coro: Cardi B & (El Alfa)]
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)

[Verse 1: cardi b]
I am the gold flame
I do not do chorus with Palomo (Cardi)
The true lazy, fine, how rich everything (wuh)
You gave me an AP, UH (AP), do you want to give you a selfie?
From you I laugh, I tell you "Lol" (Hah)
'Toy in vanity and you in love (cardi)
I want to feel the best (huh)
In my bed making love (BRR), right now

[Chorus: the alpha]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
Yo-yo-yo I'm your daddy, you are my mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami

[Verse 2: the alpha]
I am your daddy, the block
Stay with me, get on to me, kill the first one that stops you
She is rapper, but she dresses in fine
Balenciaga wallet with a 'repair', I like it when she walks
When he is in bed, he eats me like Kentucky
In the disco, with diamond battery, flow "Walk it like i talk it"
Your friend 'tá clear that I am your loqui-trqui
The one you like from above and below, I 'toy more' that Rocky

[Bridge: The Alfa]
You 'tá clear that I am your daddy (cool)
You 'tá fans' of me because I give me' you (ass)
You 'tá-tú' tá-tá 'tá clear that I am your dad
You 'tá fans' of me because I give me' you (ass)

[Chorus: the alpha]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I-I'm your daddy, you are my mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mommy, mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami
[Post-Coro: Cardi B & (El Alfa)]
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
You are my daddy (and you my mom)
