Magical Thinking Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living in daydreams, yeah it's not a way to live
You say the rock bed is dry, I say the drought has got to give
And I can see the run-down station
Where the trees grow in the tracks
Show me how the roof has caved in
Tell me there's no going back

[Chorus]
But I've been saying that the creek will run
I've been waiting for the train to come
Going back to all my magical thinking that
Finds a break in the stone
[Verse 2]
Driving at midnight, it's when the dreaming starts again
It all comes true if the light turns before I count to ten
And if I do a few things better now
Better than I've donе before
The only thing I еver wanted
Will be there, will be standing at my door

[Chorus]
And the creek will run
And I'll be waiting for the train to come
Going back to all my magical thinking that
Finds a break in the stone

[Bridge]
And in the light of this reverie
I can see it all some day
It's as clear as any memory
And it's just as far away

[Verse 3]
Oh have you heard the news, how they're bringing back the train?
They cleared the trees and the old rails were shining in the rain
Yeah it rained for days and nights on end
It's like we emptied out the sky
And the creek was running so full, everywhere
You could hear it rushing by, rushing by
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't worry, even I know
You don't have to say it's time to go
I know all about my magical thinking
I'm moving on from this impossible dreaming
But I'm gonna stay a little longer; I'm watching as
The water runs through the stoneEmbed
