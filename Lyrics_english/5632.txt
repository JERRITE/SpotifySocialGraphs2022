The Ladder LyricsIsn't that what everyone wants to know
Pretty new girl walks into a room, everyone's head turns
Looks her up and down wondering who's she fucking
Who could she fuck?
And how high could she climb?
And is it higher than me?

Tragedy, a poisonous lover
You infiltrate to destroy
Vanity, a cancer unforgiving
A charlatan with poise
Fool me once, enough is enough
Was I more than a step on your way up?
Hollowed out, I've no semblance of love
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck

Lest we learn, the tables turn
So I'm betting out, I'm betting out
You can be the prey in your masquerade
But I'm getting out, I'm getting out
There's nothing left to repair

Ravenous, self-righteous, and lurid
But how much more till you break?
Scavenger, so fucking undeserving
You slither in just to take what you can take

Counterfeit, I'm calling your bluff
Was I more than just a step on your way up?
Now you'll burn and you're flesh out of luck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck

Lest we learn, the tables turn
So I'm betting out, I'm betting out
You can be the prey in your masquerade
But I'm getting out, I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
But now, it means nothing to me to mean anything to you
You might also likeOpen grave, I was too blind to see
That "love", spelled to you is
"F-A-M-E"

You fuck your way up the ladder
Going down on your way to the top
Do your arms ever tire?
Or do they heal while you climb with your mouth?

Delete everything, sever the yearning
You can keep the fucking ring
Delete everything
You can keep the fucking ring

Nothing left to repair1Embed
