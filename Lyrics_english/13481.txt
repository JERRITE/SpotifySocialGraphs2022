On behalf of Love Lyrics [Verse 1]
Until when
Will I wait as if nothing will replace you?
You are there
My heart cry you to this day, whoa-oh-oh

[Pre-chorus]
If only you had seen
The sadness of your smile
One morning you never returned
Wake up and when you see
The sweetness of the moment
Of the uninitiated
[CHORUS]
To the end of our infinite
Until the heart feels nothing more
Even after the forever
I will wait in the name of love

[Verse 2]
Until when
I'm going to wait as if no one else is with you?
You are there
My heart cry is your name, whoa-oh-oh

[Pre-chorus]
If only you had seen
The sadness of your smile
One morning you never returned
Wake up and when you see
The sweetness of the moment
Of the uninitiated

[CHORUS]
To the end of our infinite
Until the heart feels nothing more
Even after the forever
I will wait in the name of love
You might also like [Bridge]
How long will it be?
Drowning
Last with you in my dream
You have since
You to this day

[CHORUS]
To the end of our infinite
Until the heart does not feel
Even after forever
I will wait in the name of love
To the end of our eternal (I will wait, I will wait)
Until the heart feels nothing more (I will wait in the name of love)
Even after forever (I will wait, I will wait)
I will wait on behalf of love you8Memd
