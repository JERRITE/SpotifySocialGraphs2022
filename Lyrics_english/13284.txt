Ben Franklin Lyrics[Verse 1]
On two, feels like spring
All on my own, guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew how I'd take it, you brought her to flex

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really tried
And damn, this time, I really tried
[Verse 2]
Moved on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post-rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leavе a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would'vе died for me

[Verse 3]
Raised your voice to me
The second time I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you've never met me

[Bridge]
I never should've hurt you
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would've died for meYou might also like1Embed
