TranslationsDeutschWe Are the People Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're a million volts in a pool of light
Electricity in the room tonight
Born from fire
Sparks flying from the sun
Hey, I hardly know you, can I confess
I feel your heart beatin' in my chest
If you come with me
Tonight is gonna be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've faith and no fear for the fight
You pull hope from defeat in the night
There's an image of you in my mind
Could be mad but you might just be right
[Chorus]
We are the people we've been waiting for
Out of the ruins of hate and war
Army of lovers never seen before
We are the people we've been waiting for
We are the people of the open hand
The streets of Dublin to Notre-Dame
We'll build it better than we did before
We are the people we've been waiting for

[Drop]
We are the people we've been waiting for

[Verse 2]
Broken bells and a broken church
Heart that hurts is a heart that works
From a broken place
That's where the victory's won

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've faith and no fear for the fight
You pull hope from defeat in the night
There's an image of you in my mind
Could be mad but you might just be right

[Chorus]
We are the people we've been waiting for
Out of the ruins of hate and war
Army of lovers never seen before
We are the people we've been waiting for
We are the people of the open hand
The streets of Dublin to Notre-Dame
We'll build it better than we did before
We are the people we've been waiting for
