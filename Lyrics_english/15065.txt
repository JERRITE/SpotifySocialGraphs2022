101 North Lyrics[Intro]
Hitch a ride, hitch a ride

[Verse 1]
Eagles swirl and pick at the bones
I'll shut you down like a bank on a Sunday
The engine has no stories to tell
Because there's no-one to tell 'em to
The last drugstore has sold the very last pill

[Chorus 1]
Out on the road and I am high enough, thumb's up
You're pullin' over, gonna pick me up, shut up!
The rusty wiper blades move along, in song
Having a lonely body in your car, shut up
My piece is in your ear
Movin' fast, thinkin' clear
I'll squeeze if you don't steer
And follow the line straighter!
You are the bullet, I am the gun, I won
Screw on the silencer and have some fun
[Hook]
Grey highway, deserting me
Hitchhiking, a pair of high-beams coming my way

[Pre-verse]
Hitch a ride, hitch a ride

[Verse 1]
Treading water in an ocean of champagne
You blow a spark plug when you see a drop of blood
And how many joyrides will it take
The sombre spasms harbouring
Those pulsing neon hangovers, hang me

[Chorus 2]
It's Friday night, I'm gonna fuck or fight, that's right
This time all I need is one more ride, shut up!
I'm car-jacking on a fine spring afternoon
Don't kid a kidder, don't shit a bullshitter
I'm hotter than the crack you're cookin' up, heat up
I'm colder than the smack you're jackin' up, shut up!
I'm a balloon and I am losin' air, beware
Squeek, ah, squeek
There's blood on me!

[Hook]
Grey highway, deserting me
Hitchhiking, a pair of high-beams coming my way
You might also like[Outro]
Hitch a ride, hitch a ride, hitch a ride, hitch a ride
Hitch a ride, hitch a ride, hitch a ride, hitch a ride...Embed
