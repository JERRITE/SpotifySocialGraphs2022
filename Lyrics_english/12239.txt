The War We Made Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hear a voice when the light is gone
Never know who's side it's on
Think you're gonna see someone
But you are the only one

[Refrain]
Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to stop waging war with
[Pre-Chorus]
All I thought I wanted
All I thought I needed?

[Chorus]
Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made

[Post-Chorus]
The war we made

[Verse 2]
You thought the worst was done
But it's there when the morning comes
You lie awake under the weight and the fear
Just let it go, it isn't real

[Pre-Chorus]
All I thought I wanted
All I thought I needed

[Chorus]
Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made

[Verse 3]
Hear a voice when the light is gone
Never know who's side it's on
Think you're gonna see someone
But you're still the only one

[Bridge]
Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to stop waging war with?
Am I alone? Am I alright?
Am I insane? Am I alive?
What does it take to?
What does it take to?

[Chorus]
Waking up from myself
To a life outside this hell
No more lies, no more pain
You can't fight the war we made
[Post-Chorus]
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made
The war we made1Embed
