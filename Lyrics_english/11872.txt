They are saying Lyrics [letter from "They are saying"]

[Intro: Makis & Natalia]
Lately they are talking about you
From that night they saw me dancing with you
That you frequently use the same strategy
That you used with me to convince me with your friend camouflage

[Pre-Caro: Yera & Lalo Ebratt]
You know there is no one else
I don't know why I suspect if there is no one else
Don't let the mind tangle you
They are saying things that should not
You know there is no one else
Look at my message that there is no one else
Don't let the mind tangle you
They want to separate and can't (that's right)
[Chorus: Camila & Olga]
They are saying that I must be careful
That your love hurts, that you are a hoax (you are a hoax)
They are saying that you break hearts
That is not just me who you sing songs

[Post-car: Lalo Ebratt & Juliana]
Baby I want, I want to have you
And I'm crazy, crazy for you
Not that I want to, want to lose you
But it hurts, what they talk about you hurts

[Chorus: Natalia & Makis]
They are saying that I must be careful
That your love hurts, that you are a hoax
They are saying that you break hearts
That is not just me who you sing songs

[Verse 2: Yera, Lalo Ebratt]
I already put on a sign on my chest
Who says that I am sincere and right
I offer you solutions, Morena
And you keep putting problems (L-a-l-o)
With me mommy everything is good vibes
The thing about destiny
Mommy, how do I refuse that divine body?
I'm with the Yera and Ventino
Mommy I'm very criminal, but without your heart I feel bad
Vamo 'slow baby that I don't have eagerness
I swear I don't port me badly

You know there is no one else
I don't know why I suspect if there is no one else
Don't let the mind tangle you
They are saying things that should not
You know there is no one else
Look at my message that there is no one else
Don't let the mind tangle you
They want to separate and cannot

[Chorus: Camila & Olga]
They are saying that I must be careful
That your love hurts, that you are a hoax
They are saying that you break hearts
That is not just me to whom you sing songs

[Post-car: Lalo Ebratt & Juliana]
Baby I want, I want to have you
And I'm crazy, crazy for you
Not that I want to, want to lose you
But it hurts, what they talk about you hurts

[: And was, {?}]
They are saying that you are taking care of me
My love does not hurt, I'm not deception
They are saying that you break hearts
That is not just me to whom you sing songs
[Outro: Yera, Lalo Ebratt & Ventino]
(You know there is no one else)
(There is no one else, baby)
