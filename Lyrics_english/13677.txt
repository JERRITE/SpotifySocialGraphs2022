Restart Your Heart LyricsRestart your heart

Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)
Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)
Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)
Restart your heart

Restart your heart
And let the feeling enter
Turn up the start
We can stay without mistakes
Come out the dark
We'll try not to let it
Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)
We'll change the stars
Restart your heart
Restart your heart
Restart your heart
Restart your heart

Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)
Restart your heart
(Restart your heart)You might also likeEmbed
