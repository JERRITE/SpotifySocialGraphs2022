​rock + roll Lyrics[Music video intro]
I don't know, I just remember being so much brighter.... I guess
Yeah, it's a weird thing, like, I don't know hehe uhm... I definitely feel like I'm at the beginning of all this and I want it to be really beautiful uhm, and I guess that's the best way to look at it. Just take it

[Verse 1]
So tell me this is who you are
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, "you could be loved"
But I don't want the lights to find me when I'm dark and lost
But never on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it
And then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said "you'll never be alone again"
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
"But you could be loved"
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
Oh, that's all I want, yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No... yes, it gets easier
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Look at you

[Outro]
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
What's under the words you know - that's all I want
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
Something more than superficial is all I want
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living
The more you know who you are and what you want...
That's all I want
...the less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer but I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses, you know, take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out - I'm not worried about you
[Extended]
If all we had is time then we’ll be alright
It’s not much but it’s better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that’s all I want
What’s under the words you know that’s all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that’s all I want60Embed
