Look Into My Eyes (Syn Cole Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you?
Don't you know it's true
Girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you, babe?

[Verse 1]
It's hard for me to demonstrate
That I'm at work when I stay up late
Club girls call want a serenade
So I pop off just to fill their needs
Plan, there ain't no plan
I'm just a man, and I'll always want you
[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road, baby you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous when you go, and woah

[Chorus]
Would I lie to you, babe?
Do I lie to you, babe?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you?
Don't you know it's true
Girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you, babe?
Would I lie to you, babe?

[Verse 2]
Back of the car, you start to jump on me
Like heaven you are, just fighting to know me
And I, I fell in love again
And I, ain't looking for a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road, baby you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous when you go, and woah
You might also like[Chorus]
Would I lie to you, babe?

Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true
Girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you, babe?
Would I lie to you, babe?

[Post-Chorus]
Would I lie to you, babe?
Would I lie to you, babe?Embed
