Superficial Lyrics[Verse 1: Clyde]
I'm sick of hearing songs
About the boy who was ignored
And the girls who did him wrong
They said that he was shy
And they claimed he wasn't manly
Oh how that made him cry

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde]
But now he's rich and famous
Such a pity ain't it
They missed their opportunity to catch a rising star
And to me it seems obnoxious
Mr. Singer are you not just insecure?
And now you're singin'...
[Chorus: Clyde]
“Why’d they have to be so superficial?”
Now you wish they’d be more superficial
It seems to me to be it’s so artificial
So go and write your song
Just know that you’re the superficial one
You’re so superficial

[Verse 2: Gracie & Clyde]
Mr. Folds can take a pass
'Cuz that dwarf was so damn angry
When they said to kiss his ass
You know I'd kiss the man myself
But little Ben can get away with shit
That can’t nobody else

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde]
So for all the others losers
The beggars now the choosers
Who’da thunk that you would be the coolest kid in class
And you’re laughing in their faces
Oh the chance that they have wasted
‘Cause the nice guys don’t always finish last
And now you’re singin’ …

[Chorus: Clyde]
“Why’d they have to be so superficial?”
Now you wish they’d be more superficial
It seems to me to be it’s so artificial
So go and write your song
Just know that you’re the superficial one
You’re so superficial
Just know that you’re the superficial one
You’re so superficial

Who are you to say that she’s not better off?
She could be married with some children to a doctor in Vermont
And if you’re thinking ‘bout these girls, it’s hypocritical
You’re not out of their league if you’re still stuck in their world

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde]
And if things for me go well
You know, I’ll thank those who have helped me
And I won’t punish no one else
I don’t need your damn regret
I might forgive, I might forget
‘Cause I’m the bigger man…
Except to maybe say “go fuck yourself”

[Chorus: Clyde]
“Why’d they have to be so superficial?”
Now you wish they’d be more superficial
It seems to me to be it’s so artificial
So go and write your song
But it is you who is the superficial one
You’re so superficial
It is you who is the superficial one
You’re so superficial

[Outro: Clyde]
Why’d they have to be?
Why’d they have to be?
Why’d they have to be?
It is you who is the superficial one!
Why’d they have to be?
But know you wish they’d be!
Why’d they have to be?
It is you who is the superficial one!Embed
