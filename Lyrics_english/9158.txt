Lovin’ You’s a Dirty Job LyricsOh yeah
C'mon, listen to me

I woke up in the mornin'
I'm still flat on my back
Couldn't move a muscle
Like I had a heart attack

The night was wild and woolly
Didn't think I'd make it through it
'Cause lovin' you's a dirty job
And I'm the man to do it
Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job

You put me through the ringer
And hung me out to dry
You licked me off your fingers
Just like a piece of pie

You break my heart in pieces
But I've got the glue to glue it
Girl, lovin' you's a dirty job
And I'm the man to do it

Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job
Girl, lovin' you's a dirty job and
I'm the man to do it

I'm gonna hold you till the end of time
I'm gonna love you 'cause it's now or never
I'm gonna kiss you till I make you mine

Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job
You might also likeI'm gonna hold you till the end of time
I'm gonna love you 'cause it's now or never
I'm gonna kiss you till I make you mine

Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job
Lovin' you is a dirty job
Girl, your love is thicker than mud
And you're trying to drag me through it, ow

(Lovin' you is a dirty job) Love's a dirty job
(Lovin' you is a dirty job) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Lovin' you is a dirty job) Girl, you're gonna ruin my reputation
(Lovin' you is a dirty job)

(Lovin' you is a dirty job) Dirty job, dirty job
(Lovin' you is a dirty job) Love's a dirty job
(Lovin' you is a dirty job)Embed
