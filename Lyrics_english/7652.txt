Look Back at Me Lyrics[Intro: Jay Roc]
This be a Slip-N-Slide, Jay Roc heater
Killer Mike on a hardhead beat with Trina

[Verse 1: Trina]
I got an ass so big like the sun (Ugh)
Hope you got a mile for a dick, I wanna (Run)
Slap it in my face (Yeah), shove it down my (Throat)
Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy (Smoke)
I know how to (Fuck), I know how to (Ride)
I can spin around and keep the dick still inside (Ahh)
Now your mouth (Wide), you looking real scared
I'm a maneater, headhunter (I'm prepared)
[Spoken Break: Trina]
Yeah, you running now. Aha. You running. I'ma put this pussy on you (Just like this)

[Verse 2: Trina]
Put this pussy in your jaws, now (Smack)
Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain't coming back
Collard greens (Neckbones) nigga, chew this ass (Yeah)
Both hold inspections don't stop 'til it pass
Licky-licky-licky-licky-licky for a (Hour)
I'ma make it rain for you, here's a golden (Shower)
Smell it like a (Flower) my pussy is a rose
Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your (Nose)
Hahahaha (Clown)

[Pre-Hook: Jay Roc]
If you want it, you can get it, if you with it, I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict

[Hook: Jay Roc & Killer Mike]
Look back at me (Ugh), look back at me (Ugh)

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Thoroughbred red broad in my (Bed)
Up all night, took pipe, gave (Head)
Ass like Trina, face like (Mÿa)
Shot it on her chest—she said, "Daddy, aim (Higher)"
Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off (Reckless)
Gave her mayonnaise on the face, pearl (Necklace)
We turned the camera on, and we did a (Sex scene)
She call me R. Kelly and I call her...  Hahahahaha

[Spoken Break: Killer Mike]
That's my bitch right there, nigga! Geah!

[Verse 2 Cont.: Killer Mike]
Hand full of ass and a fist full of (Weave)
Ass in the air, face down (On your knees)
I'm a beast when I fuck, I'ma put it (In your gut)
I'ma have you saying "No, please let me get (Up)"
I'ma make you say "That's the spot, don't take it out"
I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your (Mouth)

And it ain't payday unless nut's in your (Mouth)
