For the Boulevard of Broken Dreams / The Sun does not return (live) (ACQUISTIC VERSION) Lyricsen the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Live a Red Poncho lady
Silver hair and brunette meat

Burning free tongue mestizo
Valient tiger leather cat
With a full moon ray voice

For the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
The earthquakes pass
And there is a tequila for every doubt
When Agustín sits on the piano
Diego Rivera, pencil in hand
Draw Frida Kahlo naked
He escaped a love prison
Of an alcohol delirium
Of a thousand nights in candle
He left his heart in Madrid
Who knew how to laugh
How does Chavela cry!

For the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Deconsolates go devotees
From San Antonio asking kisses
"Put your hand here Macorina"
Your faithful pray for the canteens
Black dove of excesses

-THE SUN DOES NOT COME BACK-

I lost days in some canteen
Half of my soul plus the fifteen tip

It is not that it is the alcochol
The best medicine
But it helps forget when you don't see the exit

Today I try to tell you
That everything goes well
Even if you don't believe it
Although at this point one last effort
It is not worth it
Today good memories
They fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas the clouds leave
But the sun does not return
You Might Also Likesueños de Road
Of a road hotel
And a few rain drops
I keep in this suitcase
They roll for the mattress of my bed already deserted
It is the best headache solution

Today I try to tell you
That everything goes well
Even if you don't believe it
Although at this point one last effort
It is not worth it
Today good memories
They fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas the clouds leave
But the sun does not return

Today I try to tell you
That everything goes well
Even if you don't believe it
Although at this point one last effort
It is not worth it
Today good memories
They fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas the clouds leave
But the sun does not return
And after several tequilas the clouds leave
But the sun does not return
And after several tequilas the clouds leave
But the sun does not return
