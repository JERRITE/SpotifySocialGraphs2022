New Blood Lyrics[Verse 1]
I spent my whole life chained to the wall
Hungry for more
Not afraid to fall
I had to cut a man down to get where I am
But someone had to tumble
And someone had to stand

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to fight
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you
It's too late to try
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you

[Chorus]
I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood

[Verse 2]
Most of my life was heavy and hard
So many days, so many scars
But it was all of those years to make me who I am
I broke through and here I stand

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to fight
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you

It's too late to try
Nothing you can do
I'm gonna run all over you

[Chorus]
I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood

[Chorus]
I'm looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new blood
And nothing gonna stop me now
Looking for new bloodEmbed
