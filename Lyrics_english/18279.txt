RBY Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta make way when I'm walkin' through
Hope you understandin' who ya talkin' to
Hundred ten mill' plays off a Peter Pan song
I'm a legend, who the hell are you?
Luke do it for the love, I do it for the life
There's a difference man, you gotta know
Motherfuckers tryna kill me
But I told ya, they were too slow!
I've been movin' incognito
But the product that I'm pushin' 'bout to turn me to a Beatle
On the record, all these records hookin' addicts like a needle
Style been a stylus, you better drop it when I see you
I explain to these girls when I'm home that I'm taken
Why I feel like everybody actin' like I made it?
Lotta work to do, still an underground favorite
Came up slow but I'm never ever changin'
[Chorus]
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colors
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colors

[Verse 2]
Been a sinner, been a saint
Dancin' with the devil in the moonlight
Tried to buy my soul
Sittin' on the dotted line but somethin' didn't feel right
Artists played me, took my work
Never paid me, know my worth
Fuck 'em all, this year got what I deserve
Can't fuck with the team, when the world gonna learn?
Doing everything the way I want and never settle
I got dreamers hatin' on me, careful what you call the kettle
Watch the way I get the crowd rockin' like it's heavy metal
Been an independent, screw a label, I'm a fuckin' rebel
Heart pure but you know my mind go crazy
"SKRRT" on a feature if your grind game lazy
Small town made, no, the talk don't phase me
Could turn cold quick, know the Tetons raised me
Silver Surfer take no orders, ride my own wave
Voice global, I transcend borders
Transcend when my timeline wanna cut ties
Trust I'm gonna live dimensions further
3D prison made to show true colors through a cosmic prism (yeah)
Angels, demons, meant to fight 'em
Meant to free 'em, that's the price of a will with freedom!
Ambition mixed with mission 'causing stress
Alleviateâ€‹ the tension with the flex
Darkness rises in the light to meet it
Got both inside us but it ain't a secret
Red, blue, yellow in my blood
Red, blue, yellow all of us
Ingredients in everything we see
As tragically honest as you and me
You might also like[Chorus]
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colors
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colors
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colors
Red, blue, yellow
Moon 52 pop like, "Hello!"
That's true colors, that's true colorsEmbed
