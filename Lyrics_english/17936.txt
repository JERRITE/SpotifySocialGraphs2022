Inevitable Lyrics[PAUL]
Emma
I'm sorry
You lost
Emma
I’m sorry
You lost your way
What if I told you I made it
And this is the life that I chose?
Would you even believe it, Emma?
Do you believe in ghosts?
What if I told you a story
That settled all the dust?
I'm still the man you trust
It's inevitable for us

[EMMA, spoken]
No! Get away from me! You’re not Paul, you're one of them!

[PAUL]
Before, I had no ambition
But now my life is a song
Don't you want to see me happy?
Is it so tragically wrong?
What if the only choice is
You have to sing to survive?

[PAUL & ENSEMBLE]
We must go on with the show
It's inevitable
[PAUL]
To know what I want now

[ENSEMBLE]
Know what you want now
You might also like[PAUL]
Emma, I want you
To join the party
Aren't you going to tip me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Get your cup of coffee

[PAUL]
Look at the fun we're having already!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[PAUL]
I found my calling
You can do the same now
Put your words to lyrics
And you're playin' the game now
It’s all there is and all there ever was

[PAUL & ENSEMBLE]
Emma!

[PAUL (ENSEMBLE)]
Let me puke in your mouth, Em (Ahh)
Just open your food bin, girl (Ahh)
And you can join the hive
Then show me your—
[PAUL & ENSEMBLE]
Hands!
Show me those jazz hands!
Get ’em up or you're shit outta luck!
Show me your hands!
Show me those jazz hands!
Or I might be inclined

[PAUL]
To plant my seed!

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooooooooooooooo

[PAUL]
The hive needs to feed!

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooooooooooooooo

[PAUL]
Happiness is guaranteed!

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooooooooooooooo

[PAUL]
If you just give us one last

[PAUL & ENSEMBLE]
Show-stopping number!
With Emma front and center!
A kick line is inevitable!

What if I told you a story
How the world became peaceful and just?
It was inevitable
Inevitable
Inevitable

[PAUL, spoken]
The apotheosis is upon—

[PAUL & ENSEMBLE]
