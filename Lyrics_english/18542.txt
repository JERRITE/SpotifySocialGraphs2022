Do It Alone Lyrics[Intro]
(marker scribbles)

[Verse 1]
Are you lonely, I notice she is never on your arm
You found me, that's when you lay on the charm and
You told me the walls are closing in on you but boy, tread softly
Wanting to be free don't mean you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you're on different sides, and you want me right in the middle
You're trying to speed up time and breaking all the rules would satisfy
You wanna get away and gettin' with me solves the riddle
You wanna break her heart, I won't commit the crime
[Chorus]
If you're trying to leave your girl for me
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
'Cause I won't let you use me to break free
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
Because I'm not gonna be your alibi or your excuses, excuses
And I won't take half of the blame for your lies
Do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own

[Verse 2]
I like you, I'd feel it too if I surrender
But I can't do, work your plot into a goal and
It's so true that once you play it's hard to quit the game
If you win, who could say you'll ever love purely again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you're on different sides, and you want me right in the middle
You're trying to speed up time and breaking all the rules would satisfy
You wanna get away and gettin' with me solves the riddle
You wanna break her heart, I won't commit the crime

[Chorus]
If you're trying to leave your girl for me
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
'Cause I won't let you use me to break free
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
Because I'm not gonna be your alibi or your excuses, excuses
And I won't take half of the blame for your lies
Do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own

If you're tearing her apart, I won't help you
When you're trying to start a war, I won't help you
Wanna hold somebody new, I won't help you
Be accessory to dishonesty

[Chorus]
If you're trying to leave your girl for me
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
'Cause I won't let you use me to break free
Gotta do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own
Because I'm not gonna be your alibi or your excuses, excuses
And I won't take half of the blame for your lies
Do it alone, you gotta do it all on your own3Embed
