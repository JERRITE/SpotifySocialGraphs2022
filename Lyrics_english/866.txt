Someone stole Lyrics [letter from "someone stole" ft. Nacho & Wisin]

[Intro]
(Someone stole)
It is a historic joint
Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba and Puerto Rico
Ladies, Sebastián Yatra

[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra, Wisin]
Tell me if he gave you what I didn't give you (Aja)
Tell me how it fell in love
Tell me if I lost you
If everything is over
(Venezuela)
[Pre-Caro: Nacho, Wisin]
I gave you my love, I gave you my life
I hope you don't come back to repent (Nacho)
When you realize your mistake
(Let's Go!)

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra, Nacho]
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
I don't believe in love for you

[Verse 2: wisin]
Doublet
I don't want struggle
I get tired of your word
It's always the same story
Baby, I don't believe it anymore
Don't call again because one blocks you
And that all your wishes are multiply
You're so bad
Everything has to be like you want
You already chosen your side
I know that you prefer
When you see me with another, do not alter me
I gave you everything
And that's what hurts me the most

Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love

[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra]
I just want you not to forget me
Remember what I gave you
Why do you pay me like this
They already told me that my name was forgotten
My letters do not answer them
And I don't stop suffering

[Chorus: Wisin, Sebastián Yatra]
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love

[Sebastián Yatra:]
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love
[Verse 3: Nacho]
(The creature)
Sometimes I visualize the panorama
Those moments in bed
With the flame and heat of those kisses
I remember the mornings in pajamas
You saying you love me
I read it from your naughty lips
I want to laugh and not cry
I want to continue and not stop
I want to go up and not go down
But I think of you
There is something that prevents continuing
And although I don't want to return
I don't know how to hide my sad feeling

Is imposible forget you
Of my thoughts take you
To remember the way
What we made love
I gave you my love and my life
Do not come back
When you realize your mistake

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra, Wisin]
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love
Someone stole your heart
And you come and take away the illusion
And for you I don't believe in love

[Outro: Wisin, Nacho, Sebastián Yatra]
Let's go!
Double (Aja)
Sebastián Yatra
Nacho
(The creature)
(Someone stole)
(Your heart)
(Whoa)
Yatra, Yatra2embed
