12 Rounds Lyrics[Intro]
Set fire to the roses on my grave
It's not my time, my soul ain't yours to take
I'm comin' home, I've got some things to say
My gloves are on, and my shoes are almost laced, laced

[Chorus]
When the reaper comes a'knocking at my door
We'll be going 12 rounds
Tell the Devil I'll be coming back for more
We'll be going 12 rounds
[Verse 1]
I'm drowning all these voices in the sea
And meeting all my vices in the ring
So step inside, I ain't afraid to bleed
There ain't a casket strong enough for me, me

[Chorus]
When the reaper comes a'knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
Tell the Devil I'll be coming back for more
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
'Cause I fight for everything I die for
Everything I bled onto the ground and sacrificed for
When the reaper comes a'knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds

[Verse 2]
I'm black and blue, my back's against the ropes
Your hands around my neck, but I won't choke
My heart is strong, my veins are paved with hope
And when I stand up your bones will all be broke, broke

[Chorus]
When the reaper comes a'knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
Tell the Devil I'll be coming back for more
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
'Cause I fight for everything I die for
Everything I bled onto the ground and sacrificed for
When the reaper comes knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds

No I won't die, no not tonight
No I won't die, no not tonight
No I won't die, no not tonight

[Chorus]
When the reaper comes a'knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
Tell the Devil I'll be coming back for more
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds
'Cause I fight for everything I die for
Everything I bled onto the ground and sacrificed for
When the reaper comes knocking at my door
(Whoa) We'll be going 12 rounds4Embed
