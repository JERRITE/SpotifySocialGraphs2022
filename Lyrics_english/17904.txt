Outside the planet Lyrics [letter from "outside the planet"]

[Verse 1]
Today I feel outside the planet
And I can't breathe very well
There are not your lips where I left them
It wasn't life as we dream

[Verse 2]
I remember the day I kissed you
I was crazy but you too
Everything shone, your eyes, your hair
Everything moved around me and I didn't know what to do
I didn't know whether kissing or running
And you took me by hand forever
[Chorus]
And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want
And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want, wherever you want

[Verse 3]
Today I feel outside the planet
And I can't breathe very well
There are not your lips where I left them
It wasn't life as we planned

[Verse 4]
I remember the day I kissed you
I was crazy but you too
Everything shone, your eyes, your hair
Everything fell around me and I didn't know what to do
I didn't know whether kissing or running
And you took me by hand forever

[Chorus]
And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want
You might also like now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want, wherever you want

[Chorus]
And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want

And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want

And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want

And now I know
What was the force that tied me
We run together, let's go from here
Wherever you want
Where did you want
