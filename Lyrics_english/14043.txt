Re-arrange Lyrics[Intro]
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
I got a lot of love and I got a lot of ways to show it
But you should know by now that I'm broken and I need your help
I wrote a hundred songs to make sense of the meaningless
I'll unwrite them all if you help me clear up this mess
[Chorus]
'Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts
Will stay in place
Listen to me when I say
"Darling you're my everything"
I didn't mean to hesitate
Please stay with me

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of rage and I'm struggling with ways to control it
When I wake in the morning I've forgotten what it is to cope
I scratch at my eyes and it renders me visionless
Even in the dark, what I want isn't what I need

[Chorus]
'Cause I would never break your heart
When I wake in the morning I've forgotten what it is to cope
I scratch at my eyes and it renders me visionless
Even in the dark, what I want isn't what I need

La-da, la-da, la, la
La-da, la-da, la, la

[Outro]
'Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts
Will stay in place
Listen to me when I say
"Darling you're my everything"
I didn't mean to hesitate
Please stay with me4Embed
