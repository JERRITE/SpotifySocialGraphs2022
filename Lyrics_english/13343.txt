Lyrics points [letter of "the points" feat. Tei Shi & David Aguilar]

[Intro: Gregorio Degano, David Aguilar & Tei Shi]
A, two, three, what ...
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm

[Verse 1: Gregorio Degano]
I stopped looking
The points that matter to me
Get out of paper; I know
It was so irresponsible
[Pre-Caro: Gregorio Degano & Tei Shi]
You told me again
And you left me down, you didn't let me know

[Choir: Gregorio Degano, David Aguilar & Tei Shi]
I saw you so many times
They go two hours and it's the same story
Someone bought you and this was the beginning of the return
You are already dead

[Interlude: Gregorio Degano, David Aguilar & Tei Shi]
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm

[Pre-Caro: Gregorio Degano & Tei Shi]
You left me again Ðµsperando
And you didn't notice anything, you have the alarm

[Choir: Gregorio Degano, David Aguilar & Tei Shi]
I saw you so many times
They go two hours and it's the same story
No one found you and this was the beginning of the return
I'm already dead

[Outro: Gregorio Degano, David Aguilar & Tei Shi]
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mm
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mh-mmyou might also Likeembed
