[Verse]
Five opp blocks, where should I go? Ip-dip-doo
Put things in coupes then get round there for them victim yutes
Had a kitchen when I chopped up shh
Had a flick ting when I drenched up shh
Had a rambo when I got down, wait that was a kitchen too
My man said he's on me, I just laughed out loud like, "hear this joke"
He held smoke, friend got poked, both got bored and comparing notes
Pulled up on shh, swung my shank and teared his coat
Would have been scenes if I had my heater
Wind down the window and air that smoke
Man try diss, or mention the guys, you know where that is, skengs in the ride
Got in trouble in school for the length of my tie
Now man got pulled for intent to supply
How you talk wass but ain't went on a glide?
The O's in my blood, I rep it for life
2 in the dots, pressin' it twice
If you ain't on smoke, step to the side
When I pull up with gang and we bust doors, best run or that's you done for
Leave man six feet down under, like ONEFOUR
Shh got four in his back, could've turned him pack if I gave him one more
Lifestyle's like GTA, I wish I could buy waps from the gun store
Still cop that dinger, tint them windows, change them plates
Grab that mash and get round there where the pagans stay
5 bills for the tee, that's a monkey on my top, no Bathing Ape
How can you run when your friend got done?
Come back and save your mate (Ayy come 'ere)
They ain't put in no work, them man are at home, it's coming like furlough
I was going Old Bailey in that Serco, before Lil Herb turned G Herbo
Moose, Canada Goose, got the trois deux tucked under my fur coat
Dem man are involved on the net, see them in the flesh they say that they weren't though
Pull up and crash when I jump out I ain't exchanging details
I done drills and I beat my ting, before I got a drill beat in my email
Back my ting, push it in a pussy on the opp block, treat them like females
Got man down in my Jordans, pissed
They cost half my ting on resale
Stepped out inconspicuous, mask on gloves and it weren't 'cause of Covid (Nah)
That day I would have got down shh, but I didn't catch him, lucky that bro did (Lucky)
Came a long way from soshes (Long way)
My Ye different to Osh's
How you got beef and you ain't got heat?
Focus on bread don't get yourself toasted
Used to ride out just 'cause I'm bored
Got down shh in jail, if I saw him on road he would have got bored
Let me not snitch on myself, I don't talk about scores go check the board (Go on)
Just got a cheque so big, I got a call from the bank, they thought it was fraud
I'm a boss on my block, what about yours? (Huh)
Bought me a Percy, then I checked in for some block tings
RV Van Persie, when I shoot I'm aiming for top bins
Whole five years I was locked in
Tuna and sock thing
Talk is cheap but you said it's on bro, you know how it goes
That's gonna cost him
Been up town doing that lifestyle, fans tellin' me I should rap more
I told bae I'd change, she "if that's the case why you buying these waps for?"
Opps try say we just rappers (What?), like we ain't drillers and trappers
Pull up and shoot, they cut from the scene
Them man are just actors
I gotta get rich now 'cah if not I might not get a next shot again
And if not, opps getting shot again
That's me in a long black coat on the opp block, man's not hot again
.44 long with metal in the nose like Dennis Rod-e-man, oh shit I mean Rodman
Who wants a problem?
Gotta flag red to run Tottenham
If they lack, we got them
Get shot or stabbed we got options
Bad B stick out your tongue, come, take my kids like adoption
