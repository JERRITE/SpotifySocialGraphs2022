Never Dated You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seventeen and fallin'
Said I'm older for my age
Late at night you kept on callin'
Like Romeo in the modern age
Telling all my friends about ya
Thinkin' that your different, not the same
As every naive brown eyed boy
I should've walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now I'm afraid of letting someone in
Made me feel like I was crazy
The truth is
[Chorus]
I never liked your friends, I fucking hated them
Made you look like such a fool
The beginning to the end I just had to pretend
Wish I never dated you
Don't know how we got along
I only like your mom, she treats me better than you do
I hope your life falls apart and everything goes wrong
Wish I never, never dated you

[Verse 2]
I bet that you miss me
I hope when you close your eyes
You think about what it's like to kiss me
I hope it keeps you up at night
Saying all this shit about me
We know you love to lie
Babe that's just your ego talking
You ain't got no pride

[Chorus]
I never liked your friends, I fucking hated them
Made you look like such a fool
The beginning to the end I just had to pretend
Wish I never dated you
Don't know how we got along
I only like your mom, she treats me better than you do
I hope your life falls apart and everything goes wrong
Wish I never, never dated youYou might also likeEmbed
