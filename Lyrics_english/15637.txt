Lyrics love games ["love game"]

[Intro]
If you feel it, you dance it
Valeria Gau (Valeria Gau, Gau)

[Verse 1]
Look where I came to stop
Once again the heart fell in love with the black person
But how was I going to imagine?
That at the scene of that person there was nothing
All good, you are teaching me even without knowing
And it is for your contempt that I will forget you
Wait a little more and you're going to see
[Chorus]
The love I feel does not see it
None of that you will understand
Your game I know how to play, and you won't win
Because you don't know the sense of loving
The love I feel does not see it
None of that you will understand
Your game I know how to play, and you won't win
Because you don't know the sense of loving

[Bridge]
If you feel it, you dance it
Valeria Gau (Valeria Gau, Gau)

[Verse 2]
Look where I came to stop
Once again the heart fell in love with the black person
But how was I going to imagine?
That at the scene of that person there was nothing
All good, you are teaching me even without knowing
And it is for your contempt that I will forget you
Wait a little more and you're going to see

[Chorus]
The love I feel does not see it
None of that you will understand
Your game I know how to play, and you won't win
Because you don't know the sense of loving
The love I feel does not see it
None of that you will understand
Your game I know how to play, and you won't win
Because you don't know the sense of loving
