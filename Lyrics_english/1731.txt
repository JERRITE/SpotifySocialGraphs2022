Cash Flow Lyrics[Chorus 1]
You never had
I can tell that you never had
Lovin' until you had mine
Baby you're my type
(Ooh, Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Shawty let me see that backstroke
Little titties, but got ass though
Niggas don't know how to act tho
That's why she's all about the cash flow
Shawty all about the cash flow
Bentley rollin' thru the Ave tho
She be lit just like a candle, candle
I just got to let you know
Let you know, let you know
What I got in store, what I got in store
Yeah, let you know, let you know
Have you knocking at my door
[Verse 2]
Kush is rollin', rollin', rollin'
She lookin' for a nigga to control her (Control her)
I'm that nigga and she know it (She knows)
Somewhere probably on the ocean, ocean (Wait)
She poppin' in front of everyone, oh yeah, oh yeah
Met some bad bitches from New York
She said she nothin' like them other hoes
Girl you know just how it go, I done told you once before
Don't tell me just show me 'cause actions speak louder than words
Girl just put in that work, I just want to see you work

[Chorus 2]
You never had
I can tell that you never had
Lovin' until you had mine (Had mine)
Baby you're my type
'Cause she's not with the drama
Asked what's her sign and she said dolla

[Outro]
Swerve
Backstroke, little titties, but got ass tho
Niggas don't know how to act tho
That's why she's all about the cash flowYou might also like8Embed
