Living Out Loud Lyrics[Verse 1: Brooke & Sia]
Twenty-five ounces in a bottle of wine
Twenty-four hours it's a day at a time
Twenty-three lived a hell of a life
Twenty-two such a blur, it's passing me by
Twenty-one I caught a glimpse of the light
Twenty drinks later in the back of a ride
Nineteen mama kicked me out of the house
Eighteen minutes 'till you're bailing me out
Seventeen magazine was telling the truth
When they said we all have issues
[Pre-Chorus: Brooke & Sia]
Just thinking out loud
Screaming so loud
Foolish and proud
Living out loud
Living out loud
Out loud

[Chorus: Brooke & Sia]
No, nothing can stop me now
(Gonna live out loud)
And no one can break me down
(Gonna live out loud)
I'm screaming my demons out
(Gonna live out loud)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh), Living out loud is the only way I know how

[Verse 2: Brooke & Sia]
Sixteen candles, yeah, I'm faking my age
Fifteen minutes till they need me on stage
Fourteen K I would have done it for free
Thirteen roses and they bought them for me
Twelve step program but I don't like to walk
Eleven wet kisses just to get me to talk
Ten fingers when you're holding my hand
Nine, Eight, Seven she lives
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Brooke & Sia]
Just thinking out loud
Screaming so loud
Foolish and proud
Living out loud
Living out loud
Out loud

[Chorus: Brooke & Sia]
No, nothing can stop me now
(Gonna live out out loud)
And no one can break me down
(Gonna live out loud)
I'm screaming my demons out
(Gonna live out loud)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh), Living out loud is the only way I know how

[Bridge: Brooke & Sia]
I got to live out loud, out loud
Yeah living out loud, is the only way I know how
Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how

[Chorus: Brooke & Sia]
No, nothing can stop me now
(Gonna live out out loud)
And no one can break me down
(Gonna live out loud)
I'm screaming my demons out
(Gonna live out loud)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh)
'Cause living out loud, is the only way I know how
(Ooh), Living out loud is the only way I know how4Embed
