How I cry Lyrics [lyrics of "what a cry"]

[Verse 1]
Stay such a moment, don't look towards me that I can't endure
If you nail your gaze that hurts my body, it happened to me before I can't talk
Maybe you think I'm crazy and it's true, I have to accept
But if I don't explain what I feel inside, you will not understand when you see me cry

[Verse 2]
I never felt just like when I suddenly understood as I shut up
Life shouted me that I never had you and I never lost you, and explained to me:
That love is a thing that suddenly occurs naturally, full of fire
If the forces withered, without having its end it reaches its end
[Pre-car]
Now maybe you can understand
That if you touch me, my skin burns
Now maybe you can understand
And don't come back if you don't want to see

[Chorus]
That I cry for you, that I cry without you
That I already understood, that you are not for me
And I cry

[Verse 2]
I never felt just like when I suddenly understood as I shut up
Life shouted me that I never had you and I never lost you, and explained to me:
That love is a thing that suddenly occurs naturally, full of fire
If the forces withered, without having its end it reaches its end

[Pre-car]
Now maybe you can understand
That if you touch me, my skin burns
Now maybe you can understand
And don't come back if you don't want to see

[Chorus]
That I cry for you, that I cry without you
That I already understood, that you are not for me
And I cry

That I cry for you, that I cry without you
That I already understood, that you are not for me
And I cry
