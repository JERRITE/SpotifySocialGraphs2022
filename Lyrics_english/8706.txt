No Way Out Lyrics[Intro]
No way out!
[Verse 1]
Looking out standing over the edge
Too numb to feel alive
So why the fuck are these thoughts in my head?
Reach in and pull them out!
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
And live again!
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
[Chorus]
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out

[Verse 2]
Oh my god is this really the end?
I guess I'm not alright!
I just can't tell what is real anymore
I'm trapped in my own hell!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know this can't be real
This negativity
Is dominating and smothering me
I just can't breathe!
And I just can't tell what is real anymore
[Chorus]
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out

There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be!
Why can't I run and escape from myself
I just can't tell what is real anymore
[Chorus]
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no
No way out!

[Outro]
Yeah!
Oh my god is this really the end?6Embed
