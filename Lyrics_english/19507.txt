Tom Holland Lyrics[Intro: Nate Good]
Uh oh, we got one
Yeah

[Chorus: Nate Good & Nic D]
If I'm guilty of the ballin', I’m Mike Jordan
If you think I hit a wall, boy, I'm Tom Holland
All she wanted was a star back when we were starvin'
Why you think my circle small? Make me feel enormous
I'm standin' ten toes tall wit' a blue collar
You know I did it for the dawgs 'cause they Rottweilers
Remember talkin' to the walls back when they confined us
I never cover up the scars 'cause they still remind us
If I'm guilty of the ballin', I’m Mike Jordan
If you think I hit a wall, boy, I'm Tom Holland
All she wanted was a star back when we were starvin'
Why you think my circle small? Make me feel enormous
[Verse 1: Nate Good]
Yeah, remember walkin' down the halls wit' my ringbinders
I got a sticker of a foreign and a C-minus
The sky is fillin' up with stars, put the dark blind us
Feel like I'm fallin' on a sword, self-sabotaging
I built my skin up tough as croc skin, there ain't a weak bone
My story written down the stones that the dirty creeks on
I think I'm better on my own 'til I need the family
I never started writin' songs just to push a Camry

[Verse 2: Nic D]
I don't do this for the Grammys, do it for Grammy
The way I took off on the track, should've popped a hammy
Got some brothers sellin' pack, but it's not a fanny
Got 'em searchin' for the racks in the nooks and crannies
I just wanna get 'em back, they don't understand me
Man, I'm in here sittin' down, I'm still outstanding
They keep tryna shut us down, but we keep expandin'
They wonder how we around, it's just how I planned it

[Chorus: Nate Good & Nic D]
If I'm guilty of the ballin', I'm Mike Jordan
If you think I hit a wall, boy, I'm Tom Holland
All she wanted was a star back when we were starvin'
Why you think my circle small? Make me feel enormous
I'm standin' ten toes tall wit' a blue collar
You know I did it for the dawgs 'cause they Rottweilers
Remember talkin' to the walls back when they confined us
I never cover up the scars 'cause they still remind us (Ayy)

Got me feelin' like I'm Tom, I got my Zendaya
They wanna marvel at a star, not a role player
And people always wanna talk when they need a favor
If she needed me at all, you know I'ma save her
I 'member when we drove it, like we stole it
Back when we would play the demos, had the speakers blowin'
It's a '95 Civic, hope we don't explode it
Man, I know we gettin' close, yeah, i f'n know it

[Verse 4: Nate Good]
I f'n know it
Stuck in traffic, but I got the jams
Throw the powder up, I mean it's gettin' out of hand, yeah
I got a cover girl, but this is not a cover band, yeah
I manifested it when Diddy tried to make a band, yeah
Y'all way too worried 'bout the shakin' hands, yeah, I'm tryna make a brand, yeah
My partner on the phone, we lookin' out for babies out here
The world is shady out here, they're trying to play me out here
Off the backboard ballin' like McGrady out here

[Chorus: Nate Good & Nic D]
If I'm guilty of the ballin', I'm Mike Jordan
If you think I hit a wall, boy, I'm Tom Holland
All she wanted was a star back when we were starvin'
Why you think my circle small? Make me feel enormous
I'm standin' ten toes tall wit' a blue collar
You know I did it for the dawgs 'cause they Rottweilers
Remember talkin' to the walls back when they confined us
I never cover up the scars 'cause they still remind us (Ayy)1Embed
