I don't see you all the time (It's nobody's party, I don't know why)
All the time (We're having a party)
I don't see you all the time (It's nobody's party, I don't know why)
All the time (It's nobody's party)

[Chorus]
Post-traumatic all-night-long
'Til we can't sleep
Nodded off long snow
And I don't know
Nobody knows
I'm this cold
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't see you all the time (It's nobody's party, I don't know why)
All the time (We're having a party)
I don't see you all the time (It's nobody's party, I don't know why)
All the time (We're having a party)

[Chorus]
Post-traumatic all-night-long
Til we can't sleep
Nodded off long snow
And I don't know
Nobody knows
I'm this cold

[Outro]
I don't see you all the time (We're having a party)
All the time
I don't see you all the time (It's nobody's party, I don't know why)(We're having a party)
