Come Outside Lyrics[Intro]
Come outside
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just in the booth tweaking right now, man
Niggas, they don't even come outside, man
These niggas, they ain't evenâ€”
They ain't even playing the game right, man
These niggas say they gang bang, they don't come outside, man
You niggas needa start comin' outside, man
You know what I'm saying?
Hah
[Chorus]
Come outside, come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside (They don't)
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
Go and ride for your dead guys, nigga, get live
Nigga, come outside, just come outside (Come outside)
'Lotta homicides, mamas cryin', that's 'cause I'm outside
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside

[Verse 1]
It's overwhelming (It is), it's overwhelming (It is)
All these opps droppin', it's overwhelming (It's overwhelming)
All these wops call, it's overwhelming (It's overwhelming)
But with all these cops, it's overwhelming (Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp)
And on my block I'm somebody
But I won't beef with you if you ain't got no bodies
And nigga, you don't wanna see Rolexx Homi
We slap it up, bang, bang, bang, that's an Ah ee
Come outside, just come outside
If you wanna run up on me you gon' drop like flies (Drop like flies)
If you wanna run up on me, yeah, I'm not that guy (I am not that guy)
I'ma Swiss cheese your ass, leave you traumatized
You might also like[Chorus]
Come outside, come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside (They don't)
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
Go and ride for your dead guys, nigga, get live
Nigga, come outside, just come outside (Come outside)
'Lotta homicides, mamas cryin', that's 'cause I'm outside
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside

[Verse 2]
I'm walking through your block, I don't gotta drive through
And if your friend an opp, then you gonna die too (Die too)
They talking on the 'net, and my Insta' live too
You need to come outside 'cause I cannot find you
Headshot, chest shot, I'ma suit and tie you (Bang, bang, bang, bang)
Good aim, leave your head bald like you Caillou (Caillou)
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga tried to (Tried to)
I'ma put him in the sky, make Jesus find you (Find you)
Come outside, wallahi (Wallahi)
You gon' get shot by Mr. Wallahi (Wallah, wallah)
I'ma take his top off, after she gon' top me
And I circle 'round your ends, I call it Monopoly (Monopoly)

[Chorus]
Come outside, come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside (They don't)
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
Go and ride for your dead guys, nigga, get live
Nigga, come outside, just come outside (Come outside)
'Lotta homicides, mamas cryin', that's 'cause I'm outside
Nigga, come outside, just come outside ('Side)
These niggas say they gang bang
They don't come outside5Embed
