Whattsup Lyrics ["Whattsup" ft letter. Bryant Myers]

[Intro: Dalex]
WA-AH-AH-AH
Yieh
NA-NA-AH-AH
I put 'in whatsapp your contact I saw
And I wrote you to see if you are pa 'me
Last time the balance 'bastard
And I want a second time to occur
[Chorus: Dalex]
Baby, tell me where are you
You send photos to create curiosity
Send the location that will come to you
To make you evil and the return is going to give you
The return is going to give you, baby
Tell me where are you, you send photo pa 'creation curiosity
Send the location that will come to you
To make you evil and the return is going to give you
The return is going to give you, baby

[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
Tell me where (tell me) that I got there (which I got there)
If you want to take out the ticket and we watched 'Del Paí'
That body is done with exercise not with scalpel
If I were going to qualify you, I will give you two years' a thousand
When I have it and you are screaming more than Ric Flair (Wuh!)
And your sweet lips like Gummy Bear (Gummy Bear)
I come to inside, baby, and Don't Care
And seek who takes care that I pay you the care
And you stay the entire end, say that Monday does not work '
And I open the pink 'Flow Moët in La Playita de laja'
Baby, I want to be wheoe. How a Yamaha
You are going to be mine Forever, I read it from the deck '

[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Archangel]
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You send photos to create curiosity (curiosity)
Send the location that will come to you
To make you evil and the return is going to give you
The return is going to give you, Baby (Austin, Baby; Auh!)

He likes to pull his hair, the 'pa'rriba' and the face pa'l soil (aha)
Devil, mom (mom)
How rich you mama '(ah)
If it were for me, I give you the seven day 'e the week (oky)
It's a darkest ', but she paints healthy (healthy)
Tremendous Diabla every time he lies in my bed (Wuh)
Wah, low pa 'house (house)
I send you the location by WhatsApp (WhatsApp)
Pa 'what smoke', I brought you molaza
I speak to you clearly, I don't get guasa (no)
You enjoy 'with this Capricorn (Yeah)

If you want to 'we make a porn and go up in the unicorn (Auh!)

[Verse 3: Dalex]
When I'm eating you and you wrapped (ah)
I see everything in slow chamber
Yes, time stops
And your beat is accelerated 'If you come'
And to me without a cojone ', I go in' inside without a condone '
Baby, because you ere 'mine and I am yours a long time ago
I never lowered '
Baby, whenever how it is with them wins'
As imprisoned just to make time
Because ere 'my shorty, the baby of the hamlet
I always walk with the .40, although with everyone I laugh
The Jordan and the Shorts and you 'snú on me, oh
I don't kill, but so here '
[Chorus: Dalex]
Baby, tell me where are you
You send photo pa 'creation curiosity
Send the location that will come to you
To make you evil and the return is going to give you
The return is going to give you, baby
Tell me where you are
You send photo pa 'creation curiosity
Send the location that will come to you
To make you evil and the return is going to give you
The return is going to give you, baby
