Good Love Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind?
Even though I crossed the line
Do you ever think 'bout me?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know we had good times
Baby, I was dumb and blind
To open my eyes and see...
Ooh yeah
[Verse 1]
There was good love, waiting for me
Too much, time and energy
On someone, that ain't you
Ooh woah
There was good love, waiting for me
Too much, time and energy
On someone, that ain't you
Woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind? (cross your mind?)
Do you ever think 'bout me? ('bout me baby)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know we had good times (good times)
Dumb and blind (dumb and blind)
I just want only you lovin' me
Ooh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I just want that good love
Good love, baby
Good love, with you
I want it darling, you know I need it
I just want that good love
Good love, baby
Good love, with youYou might also like3Embed
