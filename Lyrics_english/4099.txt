Translationsdeutschenglishhawái Lyrics [letter of "Hawaii"]

[Intro]
Stop lying to you (ah)
The photo you uploaded with him saying it was your sky
Baby, I know you so well, I know it was to make me jealous
I will not tell you who, but crying for me they saw you
For me they saw you

[Pre-car]
Let me tell you
It is seen that he treats you well, that he is a gentleman
But that will not change that I arrived first
I know it's going well for you, but he doesn't love you as I love you
[Chorus]
You may not need a na ', apparently na'
Hawaii on vacation, my congratulations
Very nice on Instagram what you post
So that I see how you are doing, so I see
You may not need a na ', apparently na'
Hawaii on vacation, my congratulations
Very nice on Instagram what you post
For me to see how it is going good, but you do bad
Because love is not bought with na '

[Verse]
Like all your follower '
Tell him that the time 'are now improves'
I don't think when I call you ignore me
If after me there will be no more love
You and I fuimo 'one
I did it 'A fast' before breakfast
Fumábamo 'La Hookah and the smoke passed you
And now in this war he doesn't win any
If you ask me, nobody is blamed
A VECE 'problems are gathered
Let me talk, please, don't interrupt me
If I did something bad, then disculp
People will believe you, you act well that role
Baby, but you're not happy with him

You may not need a na ', apparently na'
Hawaii on vacation, my congratulations
Very nice on Instagram what you post
So that I see how you are doing, so I see
You may not need a na ', apparently na'
Hawaii on vacation, my congratulations
Very nice on Instagram what you post
For me to see how it is going good, but you do bad
Because love is not bought with na '
