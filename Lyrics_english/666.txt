TranslationEnglishdeutschun Ratito Lyrics [lyrics "a little while"]

[Intro]
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH
Hey

[Pre-car]
Maybe I return with my ex
And do not see you again (and do not see you again)
Maybe you don't care, maybe it will hurt
[Chorus]
This is a little while, uoh
Mommy, don't get used to you ', huh
That love is very nice
But there is always something that interrupts him, huh
This is a little while, uoh
Mommy, don't get used to you ', huh
That love is very nice (but, but)
But there is always something that interrupts him, huh

[Verse 1]
For me that I was born to be alone
There is no crazy for this crazy
Time leaves and is little
Baby, vamo 'to do another sees', to fuck another sees'
Because tomorrow maybe I will not be
The light got red, you have to stop
Or if he wants' we low
Baby, this was not normal

[Bridge]
I don't sleep with anyone, I don't get to anyone
I don't even tell my secret '
I get happy when your text arrives'
Because
I don't sleep with anyone, I don't get to anyone
I don't even tell my secret '
I get happy when your text arrives'
Or when I put it in four

Ey, and get you 'to'a
With you I'm going to everything ', hey
I hope there is a good time
And I will really do well, but
My life is complicated, you are not going to understand
A bit unstable as you can 'see (you can see)
Mommy, it was rich to meet you
But I don't know if I see you again

[Chorus]
This is a little while, uoh
Mommy, don't get used to you ', huh
That love is very nice
But there is always something that interrupts him, huh

[Outro]
For me that I was born to be alone (alone)
(Pa 'me that I was born to be alone) 3embed
