I love you so much, so much (live) Lyricsi maybe you could understand 
 I don't know how to express myself well 
 If maybe I could make you see 
 That there is no other woman - better than you for me 

 If you may make me very happy 
 If you may tell me 
 If you may detail in detail - 
 You could conquer me would be yours 

 I love you so much so much so much 
 Every day a little more aha 
 I love you so much so much so much 
 For me there is no one the same 
 There is no 

 I love you so much so much love 
 I can't anymore 
 I can't anymore 
 I can't anymore 

 Well, maybe the world will learn 
 With our love how beautiful it is to love 

 And maybe repeat it again 
 Couple as a couple the whole world at the end might also likembed
