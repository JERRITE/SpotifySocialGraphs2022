The Lyrics clock ["The Clock" letter] 

 [Verse] 
 Watch, don't mark the hours 
 Because I'm going to go crazy 
 She will go forever 
 When dawn again 
 We just have tonight 
 To live our love 
 And your tic-tac reminds me 
 My irremediable pain 
 [Chorus] 
 Watch, stop your path 
 Because my life goes out 
 She is the star that illuminates my being 
 I am nothing 
 Stop time in your hands 
 Make perpetual night 
 So that he never leaves me 
 So that it never dawns 

 [Chorus] 
 Watch, stop your path 
 Because my life goes out 
 She is the star that illuminates my being 
 I am nothing 
 Stop time in your hands 
 Make perpetual night 
 So that he never leaves me 
 So that it never dawn Coyou Might Also Likeembed
