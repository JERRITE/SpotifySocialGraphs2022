Dress code Lyrics [text of "Dress code" ft. Samuel Heron]

[Schof 1: Eddy Veerus]
Tsarri nineties
With Calvin Klein's underpants
Years who are in the bang
For Philipp Plein's party
Models come out like zombie
From the cover of Vanity Fair
All total black, but what the fuck is it?
It seems that stolen from Bruce Wayne's closet
At the Moschino parade (EEH)
I have stilo sports dress
I obstruct me to enter, they look at me badly
They jump and I swear I make a mess
I'm with the stylist who says "stay there"
I'm in the Stone Island store
Out of four Long Island
How are you? How am I? I don't know, it seems benty
[Refrain: Roberta Branchini]
You know, I have been waiting for this fashion night for a year
And in the wardrobe I only have off-wasa
To the selection at the entrance
I slam your dress code
(I slam your dress code)

[Verse 2: samuel heron]
Five, six, seven eh
Samuel Heron Mica Enzo Miccio
In the midst of 'sti rapper, yes, as I prompt
Now it goes out of fashion and do the rich one
But then you cry like lenticchio (haa)
I put the gold like a pharaoh
With true peasant suit
With that shirt of Gucci Tarocca
Yes nu beautiful scarrafone
Brilli like a lamppost
Yes, but you are not Lady Gaga
It is Papi who pays the Balenciaga
Why at the parade if not who shits you? (Wooh)
Those camped that queue
With the tent, yes, from the day before
'I'm giappo-cinese who spends two thousand
My grandfather would say: "But go for Fig-ah!"

You know, I have been waiting for this fashion night for a year
And in the wardrobe I only have off-wasa
To the selection at the entrance
I slam your dress code
(I slam your dress code)

[Verse 3: Federica Napoli]
Today that I put myself I don't know
I look at me in the mirror and say "boh"
Outside the clubs I'm not there
Stupid dress code
'This blogger tells a lot of balls
Post the photo, two k of shawls
From stars to stables
Do the good you took it in SerravalleEmbed
