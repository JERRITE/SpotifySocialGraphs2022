Death Is Certain (Life Is Not) LyricsRespecting your wishes
My brother, you wish to die
In a bed surrounded by tubes
Immobility's cast its shadow
In your body numbness reigns
You've calculated your demise
Your future racked with pain
I'll take the life behind your eyes

[Instrumental Break]
There was a time when death was distant
And the fire of life burned bright
Now we realize life's no constant
No will to life, death's a right
Euthanasia, not murder
Act of mercy to escape
Society's form of torture
To let you live this way

Death is certain, life is not
Your mind's in torment waiting to rot
The final curtain always draws it close
When death is certain, the end unfolds

[Instrumental Break]

From the neck down, you're senseless
From the neck up, you're alive
And the politics of humanity
Refuse to let you die
And all the while you plot your death
With me at your side
Your last wish, your brain to rest
Your bondage ropes untied

[Instrumental Break]
You might also likeAnd the prayer for miracles is through
For there's no god to care
Do unto others as done to you
Without a doubt, he isn't there
I won't make a mistake with faith
Christ's a waste of time
How can I put my trust in God
With innocent people dying?

Death is certain, life is not
Your mind's in torment waiting to rot
The final curtain always draws it close
When death is certain, the end unfolds

[Instrumental Break]

Death is certain, life is not
Your mind's in torment waiting to rot
The final curtain always draws it close
When death is certain, the end unfolds

Paralytic disease infests your brain
Debilitates your mind
A vegetable wasting, decaying
You're running out of time
All I know is what you said
Before the coma's grip
Don't want to live your life brain-dead
To death you crave to slip
[Instrumental Break]

The needle's pulled from in your arm
The pulse of life has stopped
Your granted plea, a painless death
To arrive at the end you'd sought
The cryptic statement, bonded truth
Lie peaceful in your grave
Did we just give up on you?
I hope you have been saved

Death is certain, life is not
Your mind lies dormant, proceeding to rot
The final curtain, has drawn its close
When death is certain, the end unfoldsEmbed
