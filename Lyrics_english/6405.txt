Lotus Eater Lyrics[Intro]
Death is a friend that we serve ’til the end and she’s near
Sink, drown
Can you hear me? Do you feel it?
Right here, watch the Lotus Eater drown
Sink, drown
He’ll never be found

[Verse 1]
Empty within
Empty without my pentecostal kin
You are the tick of the analogue clock
The hum and rattle that’ll never stop
The spluttering cough of the refrigerator motor
I cannot exist without her, but she won’t let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
Sink, drown
Can you hear me? Do you feel it?
Right here, watch the Lotus Eater drown
Sink, drown
He’ll never be found

[Chorus]
Raise your glass to the Lotus Eater
As he drifts into the ether
Can you take me to meet her?
She who brings panic and fever

[Verse 2]
She ate when I ate, she drank when I drank
But she never slept when I slept
She’d terrorise me as I dreamt
Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme in me
As is her will

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink, drown
Can you hear me? Do you feel it?
Right here, watch the Lotus Eater drown
Sink, drown
He’ll never be found
You might also like[Chorus]
Raise your glass to the Lotus Eater
As he drifts into the ether
Can you take me to meet her?
She who brings panic and fever, fever

[Pre-Chorus]
Sink, drown
Can you hear me? Do you feel it?
Right here, watch the Lotus Eater drown
Sink, drown
He’ll never be found

[Chorus]
Raise your glass to the Lotus Eater
As he drifts into the ether
Can you take me to meet her?
She who brings panic and fever
Raise your glass to the Lotus Eater
As he drifts into the ether
Can you take me to meet her?
She who brings panic and fever, feverEmbed
