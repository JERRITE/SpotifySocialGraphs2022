Falling stars Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hope that you're alright girl
Yeah, I pray you're well
I've been worried all damn night, girl pick up your cell
I can't shake this fucking feeling that something's wrong
I tied some rope to the ceiling and I put it on
Please hit me up and tell me that you're fine
I don't wanna die, girl, I've had enough tonight
Stuck inside my mind, dying on the inside
I get high all night cause I fucking hate my life
[Chorus]
And I miss you
Nothing else is on my mind, girl, let me kiss you
I just want you by my side and guess I got you
Falling stars, look in the sky and make a wish boo
I swear they come true
Yeah I miss you
Nothing else is on my mind, girl, let me kiss you
I just want you by my side and guess I got you
Falling stars, look in the sky and make a wish boo
That's how I got you

[Verse 2]
Yeah I miss you
Baby call me
I never listen
And I'm sorry
If I came back
Would you love me?
Girl I smoke thrax
Baby join me
Yeah I miss you
Yeah I miss you so
Baby please don't go
I'll be waiting home
Yeah I miss you so
Baby please don't go
I'll be waiting home
Yeah I love you boo
You might also like[Chorus]
And I miss you
Nothing else is on my mind, girl, let me kiss you
I just want you by my side and guess I got you
Falling stars, look in the sky and make a wish boo
I swear they come true
Yeah I miss you
Nothing else is on my mind, girl, let me kiss you
I just want you by my side and guess I got you
Falling stars, look in the sky and make a wish boo
That's how I got you3Embed
