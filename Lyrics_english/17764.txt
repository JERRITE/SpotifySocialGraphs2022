Love Won’t Change Lyrics[Intro]
Infamy

[Verse 1]
You say you wanna be friends but I'm tryna be more than that
I can leave my name on your body like an autograph
I be in the field, making plays like a quarterback
And tell your father that he not gon' get his daughter back
No, you ain't perfect but you worth it, that's a fact first time I hit it
She was nervous, now she squirting on my lap (Ay)
I feel a vibe when I'm inside 'cause I be smacked (Ay)
If she leave, best believe that she comin' back 'cause
[Chorus]
My love won't change as long as you feel the same
And if you feelin' pain, baby I'ma take the blame
'Cause you not supposed to feel a way
I could make you feel a way
Know you said I changed but I'ma show you that I'm still the same
My love won't change as long as you feel the same
And if you feelin' pain, baby I'ma take the blame
'Cause you not supposed to feel a way
I could make you feel a way
Know you said I changed but I'ma show you I'm still the same

[Verse 2]
Your ex, he a piece of shit
I'll clap him like my pieces hit
Nowadays these niggas snitchin' now I'm watching who I'm speaking with
Sometimes I get nasty off that Henny when I'm drinking it
I could tell you want me, you ain't say it but you thinking it
Sometimes it be hard to express all these emotions
Promise you I'll never break your heart and leave you hopeless
You already wet, and I ain't get a lot of strokes in
Rubbin' on my waves, I'll let you swim inside my ocean
After round 4, I'll rub you down in lotion
Put it in her mouth and took it out 'cause she was chokin'
Told you it was big, you brushed me off like I was jokin'
You still my baby and you know this
You might also like[Bridge]
You still my baby and you know this
You still my baby and you know this

[Chorus]
My love won't change as long as you feel the same
And if you feelin' pain, baby I'ma take the blame
'Cause you not supposed to feel a way
I could make you feel a way
Know you said I changed but I'ma show you I'm still the same
My love won't change as long as you feel the same
And if you feelin' pain, baby I'ma take the blame
'Cause you not supposed to feel a way
I could make you feel a way
Know you said I changed but I'ma show you I'm still the same16Embed
