Deep End Lyrics [The lyrics "Deep End"]

[Verse 1: Kizaru]
In my cup, everything is seething - Dirty, Dirty
Do you want Bife, Boy, enough, you will die (Pew-pew-pew-pew)
She will remember this night, yes, she is in deposit (a)
Give the fiery greetings to your aunt (PA-PA)
I have a knife with me, on me gucci-field (polo)
If I said something, I will hold back the word (word)
The guy is stupid and young (young), hmm, immediately jumped into the pool (into the pool)
You have gang (gang), no, you sing in chorus (wa)
When you see us (us), immediately in the throat of com (lump)
Someone right now fucked up, Ha, you hear, the cold blows (cold)
Mortal Kombat, Bad Bitch takes me by the trunk (Bitch)
He lowered the window, the barrel in the fucking-wild laughter (a-ha ha ha ha-ha)
City-city city-city, quench my hunger (hunger-head)
You will not be brought up, sucker, you will leave here naked (naked)
I fuck who you are, where, how healthy are you (healthy)
Pouffer Puf, Pow,-look, you are all in the patterns (wow) (sieve, fuck)
On the street, there are so many equipment, they stole a car (Skrrt-Skrrt, R-RA)
So much dope, launched shuttle, astronaut, fuck
One, two, three, four, five (pf-f, one, two)
You are a fool, we do not play hide and seek (m, no)
Bricks again, again count their grandmas (Cash-Cash)
Fifty pieces on the wrist, just started (wa, a)
I am Pimp Slime, a bad bitch jumps (jumps)
I have a velvet bathrobe Versace
The ax flies, as if from Apache (Pew-Pew, Br-R)
Everything is as before, the same sea of the Ganji (Ganzhi)
Threw off kilo, a couple of bags, lava in baggage (PAU PAU)
I am killed in the trash, my eyes, like a sharingan (Fu-fu-fu)
Deadly Floo, I will burst you like Bubble Gum (Pow Pau, Gum)
I believe in myself, no, I'm not Superhero (Yeah, not Superhero)
I am an ordinary guy, like Robert de Niro (oh yes)
If I work, then I work beautifully (beautiful)
This flame is forever, I don't need kerosene (pf-f-f)
Do not confuse me with them, no, I'm not Baby (m, not Baby)
I am bending these clowns, Slim Shady (PF)
I forgot how to trust, I do not believe the rumors (rumors)
Ha, with me near me only those who are strong in spirit (Fiu-fu-fu-fu-fu, spirit)
The rest are my clients, they cannot be my friend (m, no)
I dance on their graves-Electric Boogaloo (PF, M, Haha)
I bought Stick, Click-Click-Click-Click
Just one moment, scream-crick Cick Cick (VShSh-Vosh-Vesh)
Two Pounds-this Brick, quietly-quiet-quiet-quiet (Pau-Pau-Pau)
We do not want to recognize Rat-Crysa-Krysa (pf-pf, a)
You are not a trap'er, you are a tripper, another freak (me)
Direct blogger or poser, just mainstream (PF)
You do not know what pain is, I have long been used to it (m, I have long been used to it)
You are just Morty, I'm Rick-Rick-Rick
Red Dead Redemption
I need to take Vacation (Vacation)
I know your mother loves GAS, she loves action (sex)
Loved the drug sex, threw up percoset
The subscriber is unavailable, darkness, I do not see the light
