Little Bit (AutoErotique Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
And for you I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, you know I, I, I, I
I would do it
Push a button, pull the trigger, climb a mountain, jump off a cliff
Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, and we could do it
It was you and I, not only I (mm)
[Chorus]
Think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit (little bit)
In lo-lo-lo-lo-lo love with me (Oh)

[Interlude]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Hands down)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinking of
But how we movе from A to B
It can't be up to me cause you don't know (don't know)
Eyе to eye, thigh to thigh, I let go
You might also like[Chorus]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you

[Refrain]
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a
But only if you're with (u)
But only if you're a

[Outro]
But, but, but, but, but, but
But only
But, but, but, only
But, but, but, but, but, but
But, but, but, but, but, but
But, but, but, but, but, but1Embed
