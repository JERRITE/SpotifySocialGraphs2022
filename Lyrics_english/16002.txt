Too F*ckin’ Nice Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night at dinner, you talked straight for an hour
I never said a word, said I was such a good listener
So you talked my ear off 'bout somethin', who knows what?
Didn't wanna be difficult, just count it as my loss

[Pre-Chorus]
All the same excuses
Feelin' kinda useless
Don't know why I do this
Why do I do this?
[Chorus]
I'm way too fuckin' nice
I'll apologize even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nice
I'll apologize even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nice

[Verse 2]
Tell you I'm sorry simply for breathin' (Simply for breathin')
Unnecessary, always people-pleasin'

[Pre-Chorus]
All the same excuses
Feelin' kinda useless
Don't know why I do this
Why do I do this?

[Chorus]
I'm way too fuckin' nice
I'll apologizе even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nicе
I'll apologize even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nice

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I'm way too fuckin' nice
I'll apologize even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nice
I'll apologize even when I know I'm right
I'm too fuckin' nice3Embed
