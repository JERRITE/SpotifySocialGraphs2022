â€‹Sidelines Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry
Not a plane going down
In the ocean, I'm drowning

[Chorus]
Watch the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To wanna go outside
Like the shape of my outline
[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself, now I'm talking to my house plants
Not of being alone (mmm)
In a room full of people

[Chorus]
Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To wanna go outside
Like the shape of my outline

[Outro]
And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thingYou might also like4Embed
