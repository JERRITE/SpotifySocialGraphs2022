Steal the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
You mistake me for someone else
Someone you must think a fool
How could anyone fall for
Someone you believed to be so damn cruel?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If I stole that moon for [you/your] love
Would you then see me a thief?
Would you only see my tattered clothes
If I [crawl/crawled] through hell to get to you?
[Chorus]
Now whose skin
Am I in?
And whoâ€™s in
My skin?

[Verse 3]
You have caught me holding the knife
That's been dug deep in your back
Can't you see that I'm trying to
To pull out the blade that someone else has left?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now whose skin
Am I in?
And who's in
In my skin?
