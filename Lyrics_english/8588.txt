Strange Frontier LyricsStrange frontier...
Into the shadows
From out of the light
Into the darkness
And into the night
We're off the tracks
We're off the lines
You and me seen better times
Now we're on the borderline and I wish I wasn't here
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier
Freedom fighters come and go
Bloody, righteous - and mentally slow
We're on the skids
We're off the lines
Trapped inside these dangerous times
Now we've reached the borderline you can start to smell the fear
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier

Had some good times
Had some fun
Soon our problems
Could be none
We're on the skids
We're off the lines
We're out of luck
We're out of time
Now we're on the borderline we've nearly gone and done it this time
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier

Freedom fighters come and go
Bloody, righteous - and mentally slow
We're out of work
We're out of time
We're out of luck
We're out of line
Now we're on the borderline we've really gone and done it this time
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier
You might also likeTake your children while you can
But there's nowhere you can run
No more tears and no more fun
Some day soon they'll drop the big one
No more dad and no more mum

This is a strange frontierEmbed
