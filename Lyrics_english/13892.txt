Halloweenie IV: Innards Lyrics[Chorus]
I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity in apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness, this is scary, sister dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

[Verse 1]
Okay cool, it's a party with my ghouls
We go "Boo," I'm mixing mushies in my juice
Okay rude, you're drippin' blood on my shoes
I love it when it ooze, I go "Ooie-oie-oooh"
[Pre-Chorus]
Crimson swimmin' in the drains
Zipper down the sidе of my face
Spider eggs in my brain
Ayе, aye, aye
Three times, say my name
Can't escape my cold embrace
Drag you to the bottom of the lake
Be my friend

[Chorus]
I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity in apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness, this is scary, sister dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

[Verse 2]
Okay demons, let's start tickling, your mama wants to party
Something sweet just in my teeth and my incisors love a softie
I love homosapiens, I start my hellos with a hex
I can't seem to make a friend, like flies on sticky paper, dead
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Crimson swimmin' in the drains
Zipper down the side of my face
Spider eggs in my brain
Aye, aye, aye
Three times, say my name
Can't escape my cold embrace
Drag you to the bottom of the lake
Be my friend

[Chorus]
I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity in apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness, this is scary, sister dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

[Outro]
I'm on fire (Ooh, ooh)
I like death (Ooh, ooh)
I'm a liar (Ooh, ooh)
I'm a mess (Ooh, ooh)4Embed
