Not One of Dem Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Bitch

[Chorus]
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one to play with)
[Verse 1]
I told you that you will not play with him
Cut out they tongue, I'm like, "Damn, what you say to him?"
Yes, they was gassing him up and inflating him
Came with the choppa, but surely disabled him
That boy was "yap, yap, yap" at the mouth, I will not go back and forth or debate with him
No, he is not one of them, if you got the ball, I'ma go and shoot up, get your lеgs in
I'm getting higher than a plane and thеm
I get high as a plane in here
I'm outside, I'm with Drac' and twin
Come outside
Is you cool? What type racks we gettin'?
Talking 'bout, "What would Jesus do?" Probably paint the Benz

[Chorus]
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one to play with)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, time to Perky up, go and tap some vibes (Dig)
All these fucking drugs, they got me feeling nauseous
She said, "Sorry, mom, but that money calling"
I got a bankroll on me now, bankroll on me now (Let's go)
I got a bankroll on me now, nigga try to take me down (Let's go)
All of my hoes is Chanel down, turn your life around
It's crazy when I'm running all my money up, these hoes goin' down
Bitch ain't talkin' 'bout pussy, talkin' 'bout nothing, I can't fuck you now
Gucci clutch, Saint Laurent
Riding 'round with these pistols up
My ho drive a Lamb' truck (Vroom)
I pop out, I'm Ricky'd up
Niggas broke, stimmy up
I'm in the cut like stitch me up
Can't fuck with the ho, get mixy up

No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Not one of them)
No, not one of them (Don't play with that boy, he is not one to play with)2Embed
