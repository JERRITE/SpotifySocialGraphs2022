On My Mind (Purple Disco Machine Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
Think about you all the time
If you kiss then I won't tell
Think about you all the time
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
Think about you all the time
If you kiss then I won't tell
