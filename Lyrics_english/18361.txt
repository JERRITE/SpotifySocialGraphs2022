Cut Me Off Lyrics[Intro: Yxng Bane]
Let me in, don't cut me off

[Verse 1: Yxng Bane]
You know, you make a nigga want it and don't even try (Yeah)
And I can tell that you been training, figured your waistline (Yeah)
Save the space in your bed when you sleep at night, ay, ay, ay
But you never call me selfish when I give my time (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Yxng Bane]
I'm in your city for a week
Tell me you're down, tell me you're free
Shot went off, feet both touched the streets
Thought 'bout the club, 'bout how was she? (Yeah)
I'm in your city for a week
Tell me you're down, tell me you're free (Yeah, yeah)
Shot went off, feet both touched the streets
I thought 'bout the club, 'bout how was she?

Won't you let me take it off?
Have a break, I'll break you off

[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB]
I just left the fashion week, ah
She a rider, she don't have a repeat, ah
I been loving how my diamonds set
I been loving how your pussy so wet, and we ain't even sex yet
You're addicted to heels, so I buy you both pairs
Got you flying first class, no stress
And I know that I made mistakes
Take a break, girl, please forgive
She my rider for sure, I don't care where she go
No, no, I don't wanna control her
No, no, girl, suck it slow-mo', girl
We be pouring up the drink, both gone, yeah
And we saying that we right, both wrong, yeah
We've been waiting for tonight, girl, it's on, yeah
I just pulled up in the Range Rove', girl, I'm coming home, yeah

See, when you're fucking with a rich nigga, you better get used to the sound (Hmm-mm-mm-mm), yeah
And I got fifty thousand euros on me right now, I'll blow it, Champs-Ã‰lys' to Milan (Pssh, pssh)
I was never supposed to fall in love, but life doesn't go to plan (Doesn't go to plan), yeah
All these bitches don't compare, 'cause I just asked you for head, I'ma ask her for a hand, please (Brrt)
Ring size (Huh), Chanel size (Huh)
Do you while still a slime (Slime)
Ex-nigga fumbled the bag, he ain't do you right (Tell 'em)
Tell him to stay out of our business 'cah it's just you and I

Tell me you're down, tell me you're free (Free)
Shot went off, feet both touched the streets
