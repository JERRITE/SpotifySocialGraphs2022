Teardrops Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't lie to myself anymore
Silver lines kept me blind through the storm

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd save that dance for me
I never really planned on stepping alone (Oh)
Stepping alone (Oh)
Still feel your shadow on my life
You left me standing in the dark
When it rains, it pours
[Chorus]
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor (Dancing)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops when you're dancing, dancing)

[Verse 2]
See his hands where my hand used to be
That's our song, our old song on repeat
The DJ's killing me

[Pre-Chorus]
We used to sing in harmony
I never really planned on singing alone
Singing alone
Your love's a distant melody
The echo always follows me
Now wherever I go

[Chorus]
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops, teardrops)
Teardrops on the dancefloor (Dancing)
Teardrops (Teardrops, teardrops)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops, teardrops)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops when you're dancing, dancing)
Teardrops on the dancefloor

Can't get no love (Can't get)
I've seen too much (No love)
Let it flood in the club (Let it flood)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Can't get no love (Can't get)
I've seen too much (I've seen)
Let it flood in the club
Teardrops on the dancefloor

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love's a distant melody
The echo always followed me (Yeah, yeah)
Now wherever I go
Teardrops on the dancefloor
(Teardrops when you dance on the dancefloor)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
(Teardrops when you dance)

[Chorus]
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops when you dance on the dancefloor)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops when you dance)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops (Teardrops when you're dancing, dancing)
[Outro]
Teardrops on the dancefloor
(Teardrops when you dance on the dancefloor)
(Teardrops when you dance) (Dance)
Teardrops on the dancefloor
Teardrops on the dancefloorEmbed
