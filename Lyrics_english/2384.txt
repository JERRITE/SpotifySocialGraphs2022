â€‹lone summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Used to be strangers with a girl that I liked when
Back in the days when my heart couldn't be in control
Took a chance thinking nothing'll happen and woah
Couple years have gone by, but we're still on the low
If I could take a plane now, I would
I reminisce the times when we could
I was never misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you told me your lullabies
I'm spending these summer nights
Alone in my head, but
I still kept my promise
I told you, "Once I arrive
No more crying alone at night"
I'll be there as long as
You need me to stay
Don't keep me at bay
[Chorus]
This summer went so slow
And I can't wait to see you
These FaceTime calls ain't enough
It has been more than a long time
Girl, I need you
I'm tired of these summer nights
Feel colder when I'm not wit' you

[Verse 2]
Don't let go
Said she's scared of what's to come for us
Girl, I hope you don't let go
She wanna know
What I'm up to every night
I'm still at home
I'm slow with texts
That's my bad
I know that it's been a year
And I'm still a wreck
How 'bout you, girl?
With keeping up with everything
Is work alright?
I've seen your feed
I'm so damned
'Cause I'm not there to hold you
'Cause I'm not there to love you like I should
It's hard being sober
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Then you told me your lullabies
And I'm spending these summer nights
Alone in my head, but
I still kept my promise
I told you, "Once I arrive
No more crying alone at night"
I'll be there as long as
You need me to stay
Don't keep me at bay

[Chorus]
This summer went so slow
And I can't wait to see you
These FaceTime calls ain't enough
It has been more than a long time
Girl, I need you
I'm tired of these summer nights
Feel colder when I'm not wit' you

[Outro]
I'm sorry I couldn't be closer
This year, I know we're supposed to
Go somewhere nobody's watching
Over the time for us to love
Oh, to beat the summer sun, yeahEmbed
