Tonight Lyrics [lyrics for "Tonight"]

[Intro]
(Chekaa bounced the beat)

[Hook: Fourty]
Bright light, I'll be blind, say how long
Does your gaze hit my gaze at the bar?
Do you come to a trip towards Mars?
If you want, let us chill tonight
[Post-Hook: Fourty]
NA-NA-NA night
NA-NA-NA-NA-NACHT
NA-NA-NA night
If you want (if you want)
NA-NA-NA night
NA-NA-NA-NA-NACHT
NA-NA-NA night
Let's chill tonight

[Part 1: Fourty]
No sleep, no
Colorful Pill'n in dei'm glass, yes (uh-ih)
Babe, say yes
Do you fly to Mars with me, oh? (Aha)
Stay awake, oh
Poison in your bloodstream (Ahh)
Take space and
Baby, tell me yours, yes (yes)

[Pre-Hook: Fourty]
You know what I want
Come with me
Say, what do you have night?
Still, still to lose?
(you, you, you, you)
You know what I want
Come with me
Say, what do you have night?
Still, still to lose?
You Might So Like [Hook: Fourty]
Bright light, I'll be blind, say how long
Does your gaze hit my gaze at the bar?
Do you come to a trip towards Mars?
If you want, let us chill tonight

[Part 2: Jamule]
MDMA in the drink (drink)
Dry Gin Absinth (gin)
Purple Rain and we swimming (splash)
The strobolights make blind (heh)
No plan where we are (no)
Get out of the labyrinth (go)
No matter where
You just have to trust me, babe (aha)
The world belongs to us (Aha)
The night is still young (Aha)
To argue no reason (Aha, aha, aha)
Own art (Aha)
Like the notes so colorful (aha)
No time for the boys (aha)
Today is still (aha)
