Dumb Love Lyrics[Refrain]
Tattooed on your skin with a safety pin
You and I, we got so high
Kiss like heroin, where do I begin?

[Chorus]
We had that young love
We had that dumb love
The kind that cuts you up inside
My blood was your love
We had that you jump and I'm jumping
Crazy kind of something, that dumb love
We had that young love
Dumb love, young love
[Verse]
Running through my veins
You heard that sweet, sweet pain
Oh, I've tried, but can't deny
I've never been the same

[Chorus]
We had that young love
We had that dumb love
The kind that cuts you up inside
My blood was your love
We had that you jump and I'm jumping
Crazy kind of something, that dumb love
Wе had that young love, yeah

[Bridge]
We had that young lovе
We had that dumb love (Oh, oh)
We had that young love
We had that dumb love (Oh, ooh, oh)
We had that young love
We had that dumb love
(You jump and I'm jumping
Crazy kind of something)

[Refrain]
Tattooed on your skin with a safety pin
You and I, we got so high
Kiss like heroin
