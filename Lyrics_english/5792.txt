Robin Hood Lyrics [text of "Robin Hood"]

[Intro: drast]
In the veins I have frozen blood, San Gennaro
We ran to a track, mountains in the backpack
I didn't find myself with my peers around
At most I dwells it, I have always given the best

[Verse 1: drast]
I will piss on a blue car, I will no longer go by bus
But I will go higher and higher, looking at you staying down, oh, no
Here with the diploma to the maximum do the dishwasher
Drugs Party pay us with tax money
Naples Vice City, smoking in socks
He will win the truth and in truth you are failed
I dream of a fixed place for all my friends
And that someone goes to shoot to sal -
[Pre-Rornello: Drast]
I have never fucking with dad's children
Because mom listened to De André, not Duran Duran
My zombie friends and I now left from Prototype
If I return to school it ends badly, to Columbine

[Refrain: drast]
I will do as Robin Hood, Robin Hood
I will bring the team up, the team on (up)
My friends with high buildings on high floors
To be made to do the facts
I will bring the team up, the team on
I will bring the team up, the team on (up)
My friends with high buildings on high floors
To be made to do the facts

[Verse 2: lil kaneki]
Eh-Eh-Ehi, at fourteen I was badly put
In a square to shout: "No Tav", a staff in the mouth
But nothing personal, I have not resigned myself
Now I'm above an Italian and I don't know who paid it, fuck
I saw pregnant women —Pare
I saw my father splitting bottles in the head of infamous
I saw kilos of grass in the interior of the tanks
Drugs and beers in the squares, attentive, are four poles
The label says: "It runs too much, there is no pay"
In a few years sure overdose and I died
Fuck, I grew up, s*astications on the face
About those photos and the outlet comes to me

I will do as Robin Hood, Robin Hood
I will bring the team up, the team on (up)
My friends with high buildings on high floors
To be made to do the facts
I will bring the team up, the team on
I will bring the team up, the team on (up)
My friends with high buildings on high floors
To be made to do the units
