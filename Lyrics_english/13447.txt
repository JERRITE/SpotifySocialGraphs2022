Addict Lyrics [letter of "addicted dagger" ft. J Alvarez]

[Enter: Luigi 21 Plus]
Underground
Wow
How the 'guilla ’, ah?
Ha

[Verse 1: Luigi]
You wiggles in a too violent way
That to beautiful groits (you look like rubber)
You are like elastic, I'm going to give you a 10 in statistics
Sexomaniac, how crushes it
Feeling the poop (you ere 'path Bellaca)
You like to be pierced
You are easily noticed in the look you are in unreasonable
After it is on the album there is no one to make it come out
Sweat is seen by the neckline on the back
He likes to feel the friction on the skirt of
Nalga with a bug, bug with buttock (mmm, hahaha)
[Chorus: Luigi 21 Plus & J Álvarez]
You will continue, you will continue, you will continue
Will continue and will continue
Bellaqueando violently
You and I fucking our mind
You will continue, you will continue, you will continue
Will continue and will continue
Broking chocha with a bug, bug with buttock
This is on fire and until the sun rises

[Verse 2: Luigi]
What is you saying? What am I a Bellaco? Exact
And how do you know?
It must be that you are also Bellaca, exact
And that's why you know
Give it, throw yours that I shoot mine
Come on, hit yours that I hit mine
I give you a dose of music and sexology
That I start to make an orgy
Wow, what a pile (uff), click 'e toto
What gives me with to 'and leaves me silly
If you feel 'I stop suddenly
Don't scare yourself if you have a lot on you
Wow, what a pile (uff), click 'e toto
What gives me with to 'and leaves me silly
If you feel 'I stop suddenly
(Don't scare yourself if you get on top of you)

[Verse 3: J Álvarez]
This e ’perreo to the gross, to the cavernícola
Giving you fuck your gallbladder
Open registration 24/7
Viola the law pa 'put the shackle (ah!)
I'm going to make you a key with an aggressive perreo
And make the sleepy one to make the Chinese (YAH)
It is ’as aggressive, Leon as a churumba
And I like you as you, addicted to rumba
Zúmbate, who is making the case
We 'somo' what 'somo', baby, don't confuse you '(ha)
This and 'the Makaria, say it, Wassie
The baby moving that ass, not easy
The drink turned, but I continue
I am a beautiful, mommy, what do I tell you?
So leave your movie that I am the premiere
This' E '21 plus, put the breast'

[Chorus: Luigi 21 Plus & J Álvarez]
You will continue, you will continue, you will continue
Will continue and will continue
Bellaqueando violently
You and I fucking our mind
You will continue, you will continue, you will continue
Will continue and will continue
Broking chocha with a bug, bug with buttock
This is on fire and until the sun rises
