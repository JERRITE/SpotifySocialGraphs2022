TranslationsAshton Irwin - Skinny Skinny (Türkçe Çeviri)PortuguêsSkinny Skinny Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad (Too bad)
Hey, skinny skinny
Stop your thinking 'bout tomorrow
You'll never make it like that (Too bad)

[Verse 1]
My second face, my damn reflection
We always meet when I'm defeated
You tear me up all of the time
My second face, don't wanna listen
We always meet without permission
You tear me up all of the time
[Chorus]
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad (Too bad)
Hey, skinny skinny
Stop your thinking 'bout tomorrow
You'll never make it like that (Too bad)

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
I wanna eat, I wanna stay thin
(Ooh)
I wanna dance but I gotta stay in
Hеy, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad (Too bad)

[Verse 2]
I'm skin and bonе, I'm made of nothing
My secret pose, my secret ending
You tear me up all of the time
My tongue is tasteless, my heart is barren
My fingers stretching into my larynx
You tear me up all of the time
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad (Too bad)
Hey, skinny skinny
Stop your thinking 'bout tomorrow
You'll never make it like that (Too bad)

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
I wanna eat, I wanna stay thin
(Ooh)
I wanna dance but I gotta stay in
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad, too bad

[Bridge]
Too bad, bad, bad
Too bad, too bad
Too bad, bad, bad
Too bad

[Chorus]
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad (Too bad)
Hey, skinny skinny
Stop your thinking 'bout tomorrow
You'll never make it like that (Too bad)
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh)
I wanna eat, I wanna stay thin
(Ooh)
I wanna dance but I gotta stay in
Hey, skinny skinny
Don't you think about the future
Hey, skinny skinny
Too bad, too bad
