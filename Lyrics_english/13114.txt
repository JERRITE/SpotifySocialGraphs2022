Taking My Time To Be LyricsFive years ago
I met chance
And chance made me myself

But it ran away
Through to this day
Until I'm loved again

Taking my time to be all that I can
Will I be loved this way walked I have?
Taking my time to be all that I can
Will I be loved?
Is it too much for me to be
Holding myself with you? (With you)
How could I be at this moment in time?
A back wall blew thing for you (For you)

Taking my time to be all that I can
Will I be loved this way walked I have?
Taking my time to be all that I can
Will I be loved?

Stripping me dead of my skin
And all of my soul
What a shame it is for me
Well you leavе me out to
For anyone

Taking my time to bе all that I can
Will I be loved this way walked I have?
Taking my time to be all that I can
Will I be loved?You might also likeEmbed
