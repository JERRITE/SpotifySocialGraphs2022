Eternal Nightmare Lyrics[Intro]
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare

[Verse 1]
My child, there is no other way
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be
Closed eyes, but you cannot erase
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be, to be
[Pre-Chorus]
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare

[Chorus]
Come with me
We'll sink into the soil, beside the maggots
All we need
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now I can see all the misery
I can feel the night closing in on me
Closing in on me
Now I can see all the misery
Under my blood-red veil
In darkness we shall lay

[Bridge]
In darkness we shall lay

[Chorus]
Come with me
We'll sink into the soil, beside the maggots
All we need
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmareEmbed
