Meanwhile Lyrics [verse 1]
We have been late for us after
Stuttering you say you're leaving
You have told me so many times and this really seems
We bet everything and everything was not enough
We were like a lego that disarmed
And when the pieces come together they no longer fit
We are two

[Pre-stribe]
I know nothing is like before
And I know that I have to forget you
Meanwhile I'm going to imagine
That tonight we are going to have dinner
I get up in your shoes to kiss you
And then on the couch you won't release me
[Chorus]
While not forgetting you are so mine
If I breathe is thanks to pain
And starting is not going to be simple
How to tell the sun to turn off its heat
I can't, oh oh oh
I can't, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
You are not here four months
And all my clothes keep smelling of you
You left Bob Dylan's album that reminds you of me

[Pre-stribe]
I know nothing is like before
And I know that I have to forget you
But in the meantime I'm going to imagine
That tonight we are going to have dinner
I get up in your shoes to kiss you
And then on the couch you won't release me

[Chorus]
While not forgetting you are so mine
If I breathe is thanks to pain
And starting is not going to be simple
How to tell the sun to turn off its heat
I can't, oh oh oh
I can't, oh oh oh

Meanwhile I'm going to imagine
That tonight we are going to have dinner
I get up in your shoes to kiss you
And then on the couch you won't release me

[Chorus]
While not forgetting you are so mine
If I breathe is thanks to pain
And starting is not going to be simple
How to tell the sun to turn off its heat
I can't, oh oh oh
I can't, oh oh oh1embed
