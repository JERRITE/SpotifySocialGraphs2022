Todxs lie lyrics [chorus]
Whiskey drinks
Another bitch on top, I try to forget you, but you don't forget
Whiskey drinks
Another bitch on top, I try to forget you, but you don't forget

[Chorus]
And you will cry when they apply what you applied to me
You'll write to me, but I blocked you I blocked you, I would bloc my love
And you will cry when you don't know the same, when I don't copy you anymore
And I will laugh ha ha ja je je ja
[Verse 1]
Listening to Carlos Vives, the Beatles, Eminem, Arjona, Diomedes
Looking for any excuse for I turned on, this is not l’Omy this is Omar Andrés
And I warn you that you will miss my breath and although time you will feel there inside (mud)

[Chorus]
And you will cry when they apply what you applied to me
You'll write to me, but I blocked you I blocked you, I would bloc my love
And you will cry when you don't know the same, when I don't copy you anymore
And I will laugh ha ha ja je je ja

[Chorus]
Whiskey drinks
Another bitch on top, I try to forget you, but you don't forget
Whiskey drinks
Another bitch on top, I try to forget you, but you don't forget

[Outro]
Hey, one day you will find someone
To forget your past
That you don't care what you were, what you did
Let you get up, forgive you, take care of you, understand you
Until when you don't understand yourself
Someone who when I arrive is going to know why nobody worked more

Hey this is l’Omy ma ’
