A good childhood Lyrics[Verse 1: Cole Randall]
I wish that I could say I had a good childhood
I guess I've got some memories of running through the woods
And I believe I even built myself a treehouse
But I can't find a photo where I'm smiling with my teeth out
I wish I'd listened more to what my grandpa said
But I guess I got the gist of it
'Cause now and then I hear him in my head
And what he says is I should aim high
"'Cause 99 per cent of people never really live before they—"
[Chorus: Cole Randall]
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with my best friеnd
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much bettеr with you

[Verse 2: Cole Randall]
I wish I had another shot to grow up
But have you living next to me
That's probably how it's supposed to be
But then, I chose some folks in Minnesota
Born into a quirky family
They tried their best to manage me
But I was always running from my own love
Or running from authorities
I really could've used your company on my street
We'd sure be hard to beat

[Verse 3: Cole Randall]
I wish that I could say I had a good childhood
I guess I've got some memories of running through the woods
And I believe I even built myself a treehouse
But I can't find a photo where I'm smiling with my teeth out
I wish I'd listened more to what my grandpa said
But I guess I got the gist of it
'Cause now and then I hear him in my head
And what he says is I should aim high
"'Cause 99 per cent of people never really live before they die"

Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with my best friend
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with you

[Bridge: Cole Randall]
Was it heaven or hell? It gets harder to tell
But I guess I was living in both
Beauty breaking my heart, being scared of the dark
Being scared to grow up
'Cause I would have to leave my mom
I just wish that I'd had you along

[Verse 3: Cole Randall]
I wish that I could say I had a good childhood
I guess I've got some memories of running through the woods
And I believe I even built myself a treehouse
But I can't find a photo where I'm smiling with my teeth out
I wish I'd listened more to what my grandpa said
But I guess I got the gist of it
Cause now and then I hear him in my head
And what he says is I should aim high
"'Cause 99 per cent of people never really live before they die"
[Chorus: Cole Randall]
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with my best friend
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with my best friend

[Outro: Cole Randall]
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with my best friend
Wish I could do it all again
But meet you when I'm 10
Be so much better with youEmbed
