I Lost a Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lost a friend
Like keys in a sofa
Like a wallet in the backseat
Like ice in the summer heat
I lost a friend
Like sleep on a red-eye
Like money on a bad bet
Like time worrying about
Every bad thing that hasn't happened yet
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'll be alright, but I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made
Replaying fights
I know I'll be alright, but I'm not tonight
I lost a friend, I lost a friend

[Chorus]
I lost my mind, and nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?
Never had

[Verse 2]
I'm on the mend
Like I'm wearing a neck brace
Like I'm sleeping at my own place
Like I'm pulling all the stitches out of my own face
I'm on the mend
Like I'm icing a new sprain
Like I'm walking on a new cane
Like it's been a couple days
Since I slipped and said something sorta like your name

I know I'll be alright, but I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made
Replaying fights
I know I'll be alright, but I'm not tonight
I'm on the mend, but I lost a friend

[Chorus]
I lost my mind, and nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?

[Bridge]
I'd apologize if I thought it might make a difference
Or make you listen
I'd apologize if it was black and white
But life is different
Just try to listen to me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'll be alright, but I'm not tonight
I lost a friend, I lost a friend
[Chorus]
I lost my mind, and nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?
