Look at it in the eyes that you hear voices almost every night
You think I'm going to fool you
Come, do not be wrong, sit down
Be a man, let's clarify doubts and in peace
If friends don't see me enough for you
I care about a fig, it's you, just you
Who are going to decide ...
Look at him in the eye, I will say anything, look at my eyes
Do not turn away from me
Look at him in the eye, there are plenty of words
Look my eyes see what I feel
Look at him in the eye, I will say anything
Look at my eyes, don't give my back
Look at him in the eye, there are plenty of words
Look at my eyes, tell me what you see there
From the shoes to what is underneath
The hairstyle, everything, I gave you
No trap or story, nor cat locked up
As it had to happen
Today if your hand takes mine strong, it is electric
Adrenaline, places us both
I think this is love ...
Look at him in the eye, I will say anything
Look at my eyes, don't give my back
Look at him in the eye, there are plenty of words
Look at my eyes, see what I feel for you ...
Look at him in the eye, look at my eyes
Look at him in the eye, look at my eyes
Today if your hand takes mine strong is electric
Adrenaline places us both
I think this is love
Look at him in the eye, I will say anything .......
