THE LYRICS JOURNEY [Verse 1: Alan Wittels]
Feeling and Feeling is what I have
The good one was caught because I'm growing
Trap trap sounds candela
Esucha how it sounds hesitates without grief
Full music running in your veins
Blessed Feeling Period
Fresh express sex and bless
Humanoid white born in Saturn
24/7 in pharmacies on duty
Hey all prevented
The law of trap is losing meaning
Swipe Up Shut Up
Fuck off com
You may not understand me but it is not necessary
Because I can also talk to you in Spanish
I have rhyme so that you fall in love
Step by step I stay in your mind
I make a thousand and one follies in your dream to
Let your slope wake up
I am the bad of your adventures
In mine I am a insane
I have learned taking the first step that time I get intelligent
[Chorus]
Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live
Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live

[Verse 2: Alan Wittels]
Sounds license plate lyric that attacks
That nobody ever gets overwhelmed
YOU
You eating peanuts I weighing bales
Take out the petacas that my flow hits you
FAL FULL GUACAMAYA AS LACA
Do not want to copy me that my style is poop
Aphrodisiac lyrics like Las Astacas

Girls dancing for this sound
That many love me is funny
They come together with me for being daring
And they always offer me even the forbidden
Arm a feeling for the league
Without incense because it is more deposit
On a positive mind trip
Listening trap with hand pa 'above
CHAMITO very decent
Without knowing what I have in mind
I'm crazy but intelligent
And I walk all differently

Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live
Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live

[Verse 2: trainer]
To ma 'cough muack
Daddy I don't want you to see pa 'ca'
How so little is going to copy
With that level and to that mond√°
I have no missing decil
Your mom just escapes with me
But where I live
He gets her in the face per kilo
I'm on the trip outside the planet
Soto and Dunito with his skateboard
Alan is chasing a comet
I am a pussy fruit that beta
If Sony calls me or I attend them
I am worth more than I know and intend
Get to hate me or fall in love
Dad if it hurts you, I don't cry
[Chorus]
Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live
Hesitating the trap
And a glass of Lean
All freaky with chinitos eyes
It's how I want to live1embed
