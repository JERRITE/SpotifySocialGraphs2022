SOMEONE ELSEâ€™S PROBLEM Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's scary letting go
I know, I know, I know, I know
It's hard to be alone
But I know I'll find a way to cope

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I thought I'd be upset
I thought I'd have regrets
Without you in my head
[Chorus]
Ooh, every day's getting better
Now the rain finally let up
Nobody to stress me out
You're someone else's problem now
Really dodged me a bullet
And I can sleep easy knowing
Knowing that you're not around
You're someone else's problem now

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, you're someone else's problem now

[Verse 2]
Nothing's getting overblown
No one's jealous, no one's crying driving home
Yeah, I won't miss the way you lied
And the games you played to get a rise

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, I used to be obsessed
Now I couldn't care less
Ever since you left

[Chorus]
Ooh, every day's getting better
Now the rain finally let up
Nobody to stress me out
You're someone else's problem now
Really dodged me a bullet
And I can sleep easy knowing
Knowing that you're not around
You're someone else's problem now
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, you're someone else's problem now
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, you're someone else's problem

[Outro]
And whoever you find next
Oh, I wish, I wish them all the best1Embed
