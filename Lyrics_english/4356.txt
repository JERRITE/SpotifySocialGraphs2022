Very crazy lyrics ["well crazy"]

[Pre-car]
In a corner of the disc
I saw her dancing alone on the wall
And I said, "that's what E '"
And speaking of course I did not ghost
I came and hit me
'Taba border on and with his mini-mini killed
It seems that she likes her and that looks
And speaking of course I did not ghost
I came and stuck and no 'fuimo' crazy
[Chorus]
(And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck and against the wall
(Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck and against the wall

[Verse 1]
Caught her and not ghostly
You let yourself take, baby, in a two by three
So it is
I corrected the machine, come make me a striptease
Give it up
And well crazy we went to 'the world to kiss'
And in excess that I play it and we get to sex
Give it rude that I know about it with that
And well crazy, I'm already bad about coconut
Revu√©lcate that it is crazy and very crazy

[Chorus]
(And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck and against the wall
(Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck and against the wall

[Verse 2]
There the adrenaline rises
She moving in a corner
He likes to guayen and with his mini kill
My mind sonsaca, sexuality what attacks it
He lips his lips as he looks good
I hit him and started again
Intense perreo, slow, touching her, satisfying her
Slow, intense, biting her
That is a viper and there is little light is that she looks
He seduces me and induces me to break her slowly (slowly)
And take it on a trip slowly (slowly)
And that it tries wild
