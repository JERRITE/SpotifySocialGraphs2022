No lyrics controls ["no control" letter "]

[Verse 1]
Do not control my way of dress because it is total
And everyone tastes
Do not control my way of thinking because it is total
And everyone loves

[Chorus]
Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses
Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses
Nope!
[Verse 2]
Do not control my way of dancing because it is total
And everyone excites them
Do not control my way of looking because it is total
And everyone in love

[Chorus]
Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses
Nope!

Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses

[Verse 1]
Do not control my way of dress because it is total
And everyone tastes
Do not control my way of thinking because it is total
And everyone loves

[Chorus]
Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses
Do not control my dresses
Do not control my senses
Nope!
