Rule The World - Radio Edit LyricsCome out, we're done
We have been taking your shit for to long
Give up, get lost
We're the kids of this town and you're not
Started up, we take off in the night
Started fire, lets kill all the lights
Watch it burn as we living our lives
Yeah we are who we are tonight
Cuz we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
And we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
We are out, we move on to a place we know we belong
We dance, we have fun
And we go and we go so hold on
Started up, we take off in the night
Started fire, lets kill all the lights
Watch it burn as we living our lives
Yeah we are who we are tonight
Cuz we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
And we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
Cuz we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
And we are here, united as one
Together we can rule the world
