If You Think It (You May As Well Do It) LyricsI wanna love him
But what if he hurts me
Oh, no, no

(May as well, may as well, may as well do it)
('Cause if you think it, you may as well do it)

Mama, oh, you told me not to do it
Papa, you told me there was nothin' to him
But I can't sleep every night (My nights are so rough)
I keep on dreamin' of holdin' him tight
I wanna go "Ohh!"
I wanna go "Ohh!"
'Cause if you think it (Think it), you may as well do it (Do it)
If you think it, you may as well do it
May as well, may as well, may as well do it
Ooh funny, I feel I've loved him already
So bad, it seems the next day he's forgotten it
But still, I wanna do it (I still wanna do it)
I've got to love him and find out the truth
I wanna go "Ohh!"
I wanna go "Ohh!"
'Cause if you think it (Think it), you may as well do it (Do it)
If you think it, you may as well do it

Made me go on and love him
Made me go on

Funny, I feel I've loved him already

And if you think it (Think it), you may as well do it (Do it)
And if you think it, you may as well do it

May as well, may as well, may as well do it
If you think it, you may as well do it

I've got to do it!
Mama told me not to
(May as well, may as well, may as well do it)
I've got to love him
So in love
(May as well, may as well, may as well do it)
Ooh, I may be wrong
I've got to do it
(May as well, may as well, may as well do it)
Oooh
I've got to do it
(May as well, may as well, may as well do it)
I feel I've loved him alreadyYou might also likeEmbed
