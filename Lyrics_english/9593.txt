Window Seat Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Hey
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Fell in love

[Verse 1]
So, presently I'm standing
Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town
[Hook]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Post Hook 1]
But I, I need you to want me
I need you to miss me
I, I need yo' attention, yes
I need you next to me
Oh I, I need someone to clap for me (Mm-hmm)
I need your direction

[Bridge]
Somebody say come back
Come back, baby, come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Baby)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Need me, ah)

So, out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin'
Say, on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, "Beam me up!"

[Hook]
So can I get a window seat? (Hey)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me (Hey)
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Post Hook 2]
But I, I need you to miss me
I need somebody, come get me, ooh
I need your attention, yes
And I need your energy and I do
Oh, oh, I, I need someone to clap for me (Uh)
And I need your direction
[Bridge]
Somebody say come back (Hey)
Come back, baby, come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Come look for me, say)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Hey, hey)

[Hook]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Oh, oh
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye

[Outro]
They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve10Embed
