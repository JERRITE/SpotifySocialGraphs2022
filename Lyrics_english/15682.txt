A little lyrics [verse 1: Diego Torres, Carlos Vives]
It is not fashionable to fall in love
Nobody wants to be sincere
But in you I find
Everything, everything, everything I want

From February to February
Medell√≠n or Buenos Aires
I close the eye 'and think
It has become inevitable
[Pre-Caro: Diego Torres, Carlos Vives]
I don't want to be everything in your life
Nor hurt your pride
And I have some other debt
For a little

[Chorus: Diego Torres, Carlos Vives both]
Yours, a little yours (a little yours)
Even if I am not your guy
This love I accredit him before a judge

Yours, a little yours (a little yours)
Even if I think 'I'm bay
I'm just in love and you don't see it (a little yours)
And you don't see me (a little yours)
That at night I am looking for
And you thinking about something else
And he doesn't see me '

[Verse 2: Carlos Vives, Diego Torres]
And even if they say that our e 'a failure
I prefer to check it on your arm '
How easy I say why they don't know
That nobody has the key

There are people who like to talk about outside
And to love you there is no school
If I have to learn to be with you
And if you want to speak with me
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro: Carlos Vives]
I don't want to be everything in your life
Nor hurt your pride
And I have some other debt
For a little

[Coro: Carlos Vives, Diego Torres both]
Yours, a little yours (a little yours)
Even if I am not your guy
This love I accredit him before a judge

Yours, a little yours (a little yours)
Do not give more spin to life
We have no other way out
And you don't see it (a little yours)
Oh, you don't see me (a little yours)
That at night I am looking for
And your thinking about something else
And you don't see me

[Verse 3: Carlos Vives, Diego Torres]
Not written the story
Of love more 'beautiful
Little by little
I'm eating it all
I want to be the hero of your favorite 'story'
Even if a bear comes, I scared it for a little while
I cross the Sahara desert for you
You make me the richest man even if he has nothing

I broke all 'my' average 'for following your' step '
Load the 'suitcase', my greatest pride
I run, sing, jump, I'm an actor and balloon amount
I am a layer 'of everything to make me a little of yours

[Outro: Diego Torres, Carlos Vives both]
Yours (a little yours)
A little yours (a little mine)
For you to know 'because
This life and 'the most beautiful
Yours, a little yours
I a little yours
You a little mine
A little bit
