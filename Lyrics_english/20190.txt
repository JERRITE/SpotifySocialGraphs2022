Your Backyard Lyrics[Intro]
I remember everything
I remember everything

[Sample]
I got us a song. You know, like, our own song that will just be for you and me. Because everybody's got songs but they're lame and they all share them. You know, it's disgusting. But not us. We have our own song
We have our own song? What is it?
Do you wanna listen to it?

[Verse 1]
All in all we are just broken bones and broken hearts
I've got the scars from years ago in your backyard
Where we used to kiss, I've let you in
Now you run from me and I'm running thin
But I remember everything
(I remember everything)
Like the song you'd sing, when I couldn't sleep
All I need is you here next to me
[Chorus]
If you love me then just tell me we ain't getting younger
If you love me please don't tell me that you've found another
If you love me then just tell me we ain't getting younger
If you love me please don't tell me that you've found another

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm crying too much, you're lying too much
I just miss your touch, I want the feeling of trust
You want the feelin' of pills that you crush
I just want to be loved, you said that my love just isn't enough
Because (because, because)
What you call love looks a lot like drugs
What you call us looks like three years bad luck
You were out the door when push came to shove
You've gotten so fucked up, but I'm still in love

[Chorus]
If you love me then just tell me we ain't getting younger
If you love me please don't tell me that you've found another
If you love me then just tell me we ain't getting younger
If you love me please don't tell me that you've fucked another

[Outro]
If you love me then just tell me we ain't getting younger
If you love me please don't tell me that you've found another
Please don't tell me that you found another
Please don't tell me
(I remember everything)
Please don't tell me that you've found another
(I remember everything)You might also like5Embed
