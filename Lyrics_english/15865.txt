I have promised you Lyrics ["I have promised" letter]] 

 [Verse 1] 
 I have promised you that I have to forget you 
 How much have you wanted and I knew you to give 
 Only and wounded, you let me 
 Knowing that tomorrow you will go with another to the altar 

 [Chorus] 
 You will cry, you will cry for your whim 
 If I know that it is me who you want 
 You can't be happy with any other 
 Well, you knew love 
 If the love 
 If the love 
 [Interlude] 
 If you turned your eyes back to that moment we met 
 If you remember your first smile towards me 
 I'm so sure you would meet your true love 
 As I found it in you 

 [Verse 2] 
 I have promised you that I have to forget you 
 How much have you wanted and I knew you to give 
 Only and wounded, you let me 
 Knowing that tomorrow you will go with another to the altar 

 [Chorus] 
 You will cry, you will cry for your whim 
 If I know that it is me who you want 
 You can't be happy with any other 
 Well, you knew love 
 If the love
