Don’t Stop Get It Lyrics[Intro: Bok Nero]
Yes!

[Hook: Bok Nero]
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Getting that money, I'm watching it stack
Spending that money, I'm gon' get it back
I am a stunner, yeah, that is a fact
I'm on the block and you're seeing me trap
[Verse 1: Bok Nero]
All the promoters, they're moving too slow
Don't wanna book me, I do my own show
Getting this money, I'm out of control
Running 'round, feeling like I'm gonna blow
Trap in the trenches, I'm chilling with hoes
Give me that money, I get it and go
Getting that money, that money don't fall
Owe me some money, I get me your dough

[Hook: Bok Nero]
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Getting that money, I'm watching it stack
Spending that money, I'm gon' get it back
I am a stunner, yeah, that is a fact
I'm on the block and you're seeing me trap

[Verse 2: Bok Nero]
I'm on the block and I'm cool as a freeze
Sit out relaxing like I'm on the beach
Fuck all the haters that don't fuck with me
I am that person that you wanna be
I got a bitch, she is rather unique
Turn up the party like that is unique
Turn up, turn up, and I'm getting my bag
She get to shaking and smacking that ass
I am from Philly, I run through my city, my hood got me feeling like Rockne
All of the haters, they say 'gratulations, but they hate the fact that they're not me
Down in [?], I meet up with Ricky, I hit up the [?] papi
They hate the fact that they not me, all you can do is just watch me

Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, aye
Getting that money, I'm watching it stack
Spending that money, I'm gon' get it back
I am a stunner, yeah, that is a fact
I'm on the block and you're seeing me trapEmbed
