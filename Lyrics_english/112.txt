Popovitch Lyrics[Intro]
Nation
Aye
They'll be proud of this

[Verse 1]
Waking up today, giving thanks, yeah the kneeing pray
I go state to state making plays for that paper play
I must keep it pure and then secure whatever's meant for me
Fed me to the wolves and I survived and now it's hell to pay
I can feel me rising up, pressure brought this diamond up
This like perfect timing, huh, they are way too fond of us
Blessing got the lining up, divine until my timing up
I'm climbing up, you won't see me folding up, you icey but ain't cold enough
Feeling like the chosen one, obstacles I overcome they label me as troublesome
Rather see me down on my luck but look he powered up
Had to trust myself if it ain't felt than it ain't real enough (Aye)
[Chorus]
They'll be proud of this
Been a decade in a game ain't do no sucka shit
I've been ridin' my own lane and I've been true to this
Outchea coaching up my people like I'm Popovitch

[Verse 2]
I'm poppin' shit I'm rare, women they just stare
Say she wanna ride me like she saw me at the fare
You can make your move but you gon' lose with them veneers
I just play it cool 'cause I look through you like a mirror
Got it now it's time to fly, no hiding out, we riding out
I bought them diamond I, it's up but not to up [?] I broke through every law
Every hood and every block I hope they hear me now
You just be weary of them people who won't break a dime
Them early ages they see greatness they won't take the crown
I am not your enemy I'm just gon' say it now
Big as gold, it's what I'm on and I stick to my vow
Look in the mirror every day and I've been hella proud, feel me now
They gon' build you up and tear you down, just stand your ground
Must be rooted to keep evil out, them people out
Watch your tongue and who you speaking 'bout
If your intentions don't align the we gon' weave it out
Straight up
(If your intentions don't align the we gon' weave it out
Straight up)

They'll be proud of this
Been a decade in a game ain't do no sucka shit
I've been ridin' my own lane and I've been true to this
Outchea coaching up my people like I'm Popovitch
I'm poppin' shit I'm...

[Outro: Gregg Popovitch]
It's about discipline, it's about building the blocks. Its about the relationships with your players, How do you get something out of somebody who's selfish or doesn't really compete the way you'd like, and so on and so forth. All those things I think have more to do with winning and losing than being able to draw a certain kind of playEmbed
