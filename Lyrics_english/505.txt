DJ Khaled - Party ft. Quavo & Takeoff Lyrics [Intro: DJ Khaled & Eddie Murphy]
(Party all the time, celebrate all the time, celebrate all the time)
We are the best song (my mine wants to celebrate all the time, celebrate all the time)
(One more)
(DJ Khaled)

[Verse 1: Quavo & Takeoff]
I like the most naughty women (go)
Woo, woo, g6, let's go (woo)
Rich blacks so coming in the city (by God)
Your mine is outside getting excited
Showing me the breasts (woo), acting like a threat (Su ')
Standing on the couch (what?), The front in business (goes)
The drink is in your mouth (drink), swallows, does not spit (swallow)
Celebrate all the time (woo), I'm feeling like Diddy (Diddy)
The wrist is shining (icе), I'm feeling like a billionaire (billionaire)
[Chorus: Quavo]
God acrеdita, God believes, I am a witness (woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to sluts (woo)
I know the gang is at the event by the pendant (south ')
I'm still at the meeting, I'll be back in a minute

[Post Refrones: Quavo]
(BRR, BRR), on the phone talking about money (hey)
We are the best, we are very blessed, we keep winning (we are the best)
The party will not stop, it will not end, let's go there

[Pre-Statement: Takeoff]
Let's go there (there), we got it (we got it)
I'm committed (committed), we are involved in this (in this)
In the city (city), we are getting excited (excited)
Stop being sentimental and goes after some benji's

[Chorus: Quavo]
God believes, God believes, I am a witness (woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to sluts (woo)
I know the gang is at the event by the pendant (south ')
I'm still at the meeting, I'll be back in a minute

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I told her to activate, play back, gave appetite
Patek K calls me six digits, a frame of Patek (Patek)
I went to school and arrived hard, I graduated
I can't fuck with this bitch, it is complicated
If I don't get this money, I get agitated (money)
She is swinging this ass, but she graduated (rebola)
With mushrooms at the party, it gets excited (excited)
They are telling me that it is my time
Pro Grind of Tony Hawk, like, fuck, I have to endure (fuck)
The angels take care of me
Looking at demons and such, you can't run, you have to face (face)
When they give up on you, they don't even like you anymore
(Fuck them), take this back to the base (bitch)
I am a don given, I'm sporting using my meadows
I'm shining with my necklace, Three 6 Mafia (let's go there)
You might also like [pre-defense: Takeoff]
We got it (we got it)
I'm committed (committed), we are involved in this (in this)
In the city (city), we are getting excited (excited)
Stop being sentimental and goes after some benji's

[Chorus: Quavo]
God believes, God believes, I am a witness (woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to sluts (woo)
I know the gang is at the event by the pendant (south ')
I'm still at the meeting, I'll be back in a minute

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Capiche, we don't eat tilapia
It's a mafia party, a mafia party, sounds like a lion when the engine starts
I came from that pack, we exhausted the garden (gang)
You said what? Print for your forgiveness (what?)
In overcoat there is a carbon (BRR)
I get out of the car with a hot bitch (hot)
But I have a contact with Barbies (Barbie)
Ducati, Kawasaki, Harleys (SKRRT)
Goddess Designer Clothes (Yeah)
I signed, but, fuck to be modest
This is what you do when you can (spend)
I lost my grandmother, we lost Lil Keed
Made a guy feel like gotit (mother)
Celebrate all the time, I put it on the line
If she's not a cat, then she's not mine (let's go there)
[Pre-Statement: Takeoff]
We got it (we got it)
I'm committed (committed), we are involved in this (in this)
In the city (city), we are getting excited (excited)
Stop being sentimental and goes after some benji's

[Chorus: Quavo]
God believes, God believes, I am a witness (woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to sluts (woo)
I know the gang is at the event by the pendant (south ')
I'm still at the meeting, I'll be back in a minute

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I put this shit, I'm not trying, I'm sporting in the formation of the NBA (sporting)
I'm stepping on these guys, it's time for the crisis (stepping)
Like this pussy, it's lunch time (how)
Give me this pussy just like webbie (give me that)
She has that splash, that wet (splash)
We celebrate all night and she never forgets (never forget)
Takeoff (let's go there)

[Pre-Statement: Takeoff]
We got it (we got it)
I'm committed (committed), we are involved in this (in this)
In the city (city), we are getting excited (excited)
Stop being sentimental and goes after some benji's

[Chorus: Quavo]
God believes, God believes, I am a witness (woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to sluts (woo)
I know the gang is at the event by the pendant (south ')
I'm still at the meeting, I'll be back in a minute
