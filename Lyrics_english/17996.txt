Wouldnâ€™t Change a Thing Lyrics[Verse 1: Mitchie]
It's like he doesn't hear a word I say
His mind is somewhere far away
And I don't know how to get there

[Verse 2: Mitchie, Shane]
It's like (She's way too serious)
All he wants is to chill out (She's always in a rush)
Makes me wanna pull all my hair out (And interrupting)
Like he doesn't even care (Like she doesn't even care)
[Pre-Chorus: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

[Chorus: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
We're like fire and rain (Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (We're Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

[Verse 3: Shane]
She's always tryin' to save the day
Just wanna let my music play
She's all or nothin'
But my feelings never change

[Verse 4: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
Why (I try to read her mind)
Does he try to read my mind? (She tries to pick a fight)
It's not good to psychoanalyze (To get attention)
That's what all of my friends say
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye

[Chorus: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
We're like fire and rain (Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (We're Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing

[Bridge: Shane, Mitchie, Both]
When I'm yes, she's no
When I hold on, he just lets go
We're perfectly imperfect
But I wouldn't change a thing, no

[Chorus: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
We're like fire and rain (Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars (We're Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
[Outro: Mitchie, Shane, Both]
We're Venus and Mars (We're Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars (Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a
Wouldn't change a thing6Embed
