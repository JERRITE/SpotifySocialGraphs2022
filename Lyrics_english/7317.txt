Zydrate Anatomy LyricsGirls:
I can't feel nothing at all (x2)

Grave Robber:
Drug Market
Submarket
Sometimes, I wonder why I ever got in

Blood Market
Love Market
Sometimes, I wonder why they need me at all
Zydrate comes in a little glass vial

Shilo:
A little glass vial?

Girls:
A little glass vial

Grave Robber:
And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery
And the Zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy
And when the gun goes off, it sparks, and you're ready for surgery
Surgery...

Amber Sweet:
Grave Robber, Grave Robber
Sometimes, I wonder why I even bother
Graver Robber, Grave Robber
Sometimes, I wonder why I need you at all

Grave Robber:
And Amber Sweet is addicted to the knife

Shilo:
Addicted to the knife?

Addicted to the knife

Grave Robber:
And addicted to the knife
She needs a little help with the agony
And a little help comes in a little glass vial
In a gun pressed against her anatomy
And when the gun goes off, Miss Sweet is ready for surgery
Surgery...

Amber Sweet:
Graver Robber, Grave Robber
Sometimes, I wonder why I need you at all

Girls:
It's clean
It's clear
It's pure
It's rare [x6]

Grave Robber:
It takes you there (x2)
Before you cut
A change inside
Amber Sweet:
I can't feel nothing at all
I feel alive!

Grave Robber:
Mag's contract's got some mighty fine print

Shilo:
Mighty fine print?

Girls:
Mighty... fine... print

Grave Robber:
And that mighty fine print puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament
If Mag up and splits, her eyes are forfeit
And if GeneCo and Rotti so will it
Then a Repo Man will come
And she'll pay for that surgery
Surgery!2Embed
