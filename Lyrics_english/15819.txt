CARALUNA LYRICS [LETTER OF "CARALUNA"]

[Verse 1]
Who says they don't hurt
The footprints in the sand?
Your footprint the sea took it
But the moon is still there
But that moon is my condemnation
Slowly
Shouted at night
The living voices of memory disguise them as intuition
And in a voice, your voice hides
And in a voice, your voice hides
[Pre-car]
And I know what maybe
You never listen to my song, I know
And I know that maybe I continue using you like this
Stealing my inspiration

[Chorus]
As long as you see your face on the face of the moon
While keep listening to your voice
Among the waves, between the foam
While you have to change the station radio
Because every song tells me about you, from you, of you
I speak to me

[Verse 2]
Life hides
Behind a promise without fulfilling
Where does any inspiration be born?
Where did another song be born?
And I don't know who hides well
I no longer know what is hidden

[Pre-car]
And I know what maybe
You never listen to my song, I know
And I know that maybe I will continue using you
Stealing my inspiration

As long as you see your face on the face of the moon
While keep listening to your voice
Among the waves, between the foam
While you have to change the station radio
Because every song tells me about you, from you, of you
Oh, as long as you see your face on the face of the moon
While keep listening to your voice
Among the waves, between the foam
While you have to change the station radio
Because every song tells me about you, from you, of you

[Bridge]
I will keep looking or keep escaping
Maybe from you, maybe from me
I will continue looking for an explanation, to this song

[Chorus]
Oh, as long as you see your face on the face of the moon
While keep listening to your voice
Among the waves, between the foam
While you have to change the station radio
Because every song tells me about you, from you, of you

Oh, as long as you see your face on the face of the moon
While keep listening to your voice
Among the waves, between the foam
While you have to change the station radio
Because every song tells me about you, from you, of you
[Outro]
I talk about you (from you, you)
I speak to me
Of you
I speak to me
Ay, ay, ay, ay3embed
