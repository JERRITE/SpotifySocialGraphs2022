What Took You So Long? Lyrics[Verse 1]
What took you so long?
Your lasting impression answered questions, words unknown
What took you so long and what are you waiting for?
Oh, kiss me, I forget how it feels
I am not searching anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was not me until I
Discovered you for the first time
[Chorus]
I think I'm feeling like somebody
I found some bliss in our insignificance
No question, no doubt about it
You are the difference, you are significant
You make me significant
You are significant

[Verse 2]
What took you so long and where have you always been?
You're so sharp, I love your disregard for anyone and everything
Disruption of ourselves, sending energy
We are connecting now in new forms, in better ways
This intelligence is an epiphany

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was not me until I
Discovered you for the first time

[Chorus]
I think I'm feeling like somebody
I found some bliss in our insignificance
No question, no doubt about it
You are the difference, you are significant
You make me significant
You are significant
You might also like[Bridge]
Before you I could not see how I would coincide
With the big world and such little time

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not me until I
Discovered you
I was not me until I
Discovered you for the first time

[Chorus]
I think I'm feeling like somebody
I found some bliss in our insignificance
No question, no doubt about it
You are the difference, you are significant
(I was not me until I
Discovered you)
You make me significant
(I was not me until I
Discovered you)
You are significant1Embed
