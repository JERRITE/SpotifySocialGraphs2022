A Lack of Understanding Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's only been a year
But it feels like a lifetime here
How's it been for you?
Does it feel like a lifetime too?
What would you do now in light of it all?
I don't regret it in spite of it all
If I can't convince you then nobody can
I guess

[Chorus]
I've got too much time on my hands
But you don't understand
Or you won't understand
[Verse 2]
Would it make it right?
Would it make you less uptight?
What would it achieve?
What should I put up my sleeve?
What did you think would come out of it all?
That we'd quit pretending we doubted it all?
You don't make me nervous
Hell, nobody does these days

[Chorus]
I've got too much time on my hands
But you don't understand
Or you won't understand
I've got too much time on my hands
But you don't understand
Or you won't understand

[Bridge]
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this?
Should I shake your hand or should I give you a kiss?
Is this everything you always hoped it would be?
We'll see...

[Chorus]
I've got too much time on my hands
But you don't understand
Or you won't understand
I've got too much time on my hands
But you don't understand
Or you won't understandYou might also like5Embed
