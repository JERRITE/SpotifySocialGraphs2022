TranslationsDeutschINFECTED Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think we did it this time
There's something in the air inside, the star shine
There's something in the air we'll never know
I can feel it take hold, infected
They're calling on the landlines
The senators are standing on the shorelines
The warning lights are burning all aglow
Now we reap what we sow, infected

[Chorus]
We do it one by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way this world has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
[Verse 2]
Here's a challenge for all mankind
The preacher man is warning of the end times
The weatherman agrees but he don't know
So he's got to go now

[Chorus]
We do it one by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way this world has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected

[Bridge]
One if by land and two if by sea
Maybe it's both and we'll all get lucky
Go to the end man, don't quit on me
Get what you wanted
Anarchy

[Chorus]
One by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way this world has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infectedYou might also like9Embed
