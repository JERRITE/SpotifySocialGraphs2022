This is familiar, I feel ya
How can that be?
I thought I was gone now, on the run now
Tryna find a happier me
But flyin' away didn't fix a thing
Barely alive on this G5
Bottle away from me drowning
Start with a sip, then I down it
Land in Toronto, I'm tipsy
You never say that you miss me
But I know that you miss me
I wish you were with me, hey
[Chorus: SiR & Kadhja Bonet]
New sky, new sky
Won't you let the clouds go by?
Too soon, blue moon
Don't need you around
Bringin' me back down
Bringin' me back

[Verse 2: SiR]
A conversation that we never had replayin' in my head
I say the right thing and you smile just like you used to
Took me way back to when I knew you
This time, I don't make the same mistakes
I don't ever break your heart
You don't have all you can take
And we don't fall apart
Oh, this can't be real
Already made my escape
Some things you can't run away from
I wanted to weather the change
Tried my best to outrun the rain
Only way I deal with the pain
I know you feel the same
I know you feel the same (Same)

[Chorus: SiR & Kadhja Bonet]
New sky, new sky
Won't you let the clouds go by?
Too soon, blue moon
Don't need you around
Bringin' me back down
Bringin' me back
