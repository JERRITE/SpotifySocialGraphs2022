I'm not so strong Lyricse demonstrating who has control
Of the romantic genre
The memory in the photos
Of the kisses we gave ourselves
Caresses that did not miss
All the time we invest
You are already something necessary
I am not so strong
I have to admit
I'm a fool to lose you
(chorus)
And I'm not so strong
I have a lump in the throat
And your absence made an empty
Nobody fills in me
And I'm not so strong
Because fear accompanies me
The fear of your rejection
And not wanting to return to my
Makes me a millionaire
But without you I went bankrupt
Makes me feel like a river
Caudalozo but in drought
And only stone remains
And while one of you wants
That a singing is followed to love
The voice
It will always be ay
YELSID MAMIII!
It was never me who decided
Say goodbye and no more
And I swore that for any reason
I go looking for you
Here you have me at your feet
Asking forgiveness
Suffering in Silecio for my absurd decision
I realized that without you I didn't live might also likembed
