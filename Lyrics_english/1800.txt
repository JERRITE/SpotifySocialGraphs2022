Wrong About Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should have known from the start
If there would be a day where things would change, babe
It's just I gave you my heart
Thinking you would stay but you walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
It didn't have to be confusing
You said you needed a lil' bit more space
Instead you went with him
The least you coulda do is say it to my face, baby
[Chorus]
I'm not saying that you lie, but
Don't be wasting my time
Confusing me like we'd get back together
And think you, were my ride or die, but
Leave me for a new guy
I guess that I was wrong about forever

[Verse 2]
Callin' but you hit decline
Only time will tell if you're someone else (heh)
It's just I gave you my time
But you closed the book and put it on the shelf

[Pre-Chorus]
It didn't have to be confusing
You said you needed a lil' bit more space
Instead you went with him
The least you coulda do is say it to my face, baby

[Chorus]
I'm not saying that you lie, but
Don't be wasting my time
Confusing me like we'd get back together
And think you, were my ride or die, but
Leave me for a new guy
I guess that I was wrong about forever

I'm not saying that you lie (I ain't saying that you lie), but
Don't be wasting my time (Don't be wasting my time, baby)
Confusing me like we'd get back together (Confusing me like we'd get back together)
Think you, were my ride or die (said you were my ride or die), but
Leave me for a new guy (leave me for a new guy)
I guess that I was wrong about foreverEmbed
