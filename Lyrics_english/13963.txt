Love’s Not A Competition (But I’m Winning) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I won't be the one to disappoint you anymore
And I know I said all this so that you've heard it all before
The trick is getting you to think that all this was your idea
And that is everything you've ever wanted out of here

[Chorus]
Love's not a competition but I'm winning

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure what's truly altruistic anymore
'Cause every good thing that I do is listed and you're keeping score
[Chorus]
Well, love's not a competition but I'm winning
Well, love's not a competition but I'm winning

[Post-Chorus]
Or at least I thought I was
But there's no way of knowing
At least I thought I was
But there's no way of knowing

[Bridge]
You know what it's like when you're new to the game
But I'm not
(Oh!)

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Well, I won't be the one to disappoint you
Well, I won't be the one to disappoint you anymore
Well, I won't be the one to disappoint you anymore
Love's not a competition but I'm winning
I won't be the one to disappoint you anymore
Love's not a competition but I'm winning
I won't be the one to disappoint you anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
