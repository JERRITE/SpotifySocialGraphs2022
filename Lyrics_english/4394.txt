Freddie Gibbs - Feel no Pain Ft. Anderson .Paak & Raekwon (Spanish translation) Lyrics ["Freddie Gibbs - Feel no Pain Ft. Anderson .Paak & Raekwon (Spanish translation)"] "]"]

[Enter: Anderson .Paak]
Let us pray

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Conqueror King (yes, sir), good author (for the king)
Promise, we are good forever (every day)
However (make him leave), it happens (far)
I don't feel pain (shut up, let us pray)
Main counselor (yes, sir), co -founder (for the king)
My paperwork in order (it is no longer in the case)
However (I can go), it passes (any day)
I don't feel pain (ayy)
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Heavy shit, but I carry it easily (in God)
Juices and berries, with a tail like hakeem (cancel
Breaking the meat until it becomes a chopped carn
And I am with a mafia, ask Bolo√±esa
Well with the legs, they eat and then weave
Now we are loose, driving cars in the streets (OH)
Like Keanu Reeves when I had just made
Destrule it for me, it is better for the vagina not to sorry (leave us orae)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Freddie Gibbs]
Conqueror King (yes, sir), good author (for the king)
Promise, we are good forever (every day)
However (make him leave), it happens (far)
I don't feel pain (shut up, let us pray)
Main counselor (yes, sir), co -founder (for the king)
My paperwork in order (it is no longer in the case)
However (I can go), it passes (any day)
I don't feel pain (uh, yes)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Heavy shit, but I carry it easily (yes)
Like a secondary janter, I carry the keys
Say credit for this drug, I'm charging payment checks with my friends (Oh, yes)
Back in the gap, when I went through that crack, I served my bags in Mickey D
In my mom
These racist crackers, rope rope, are Bubba Wallace
When I hell the holidays, I just want justice for Breonna (yes)
I can't go out, I could catch a crown or a hollow tip (Baow)
Drug in my Fanta, doll in Niagara, I have a lot of style

Conqueror King (yes, sir), good author (for the king)
Promise, we are good forever (let it drip, bitch, every day)
However (make him leave), it happens (far)
I don't feel pain (and we don't feel pain, black, shut up, let us pray)
Main counselor (yes, sir), co -founder (for the king)
My paperwork in order (it is no longer in the case)
However (I can go), it passes (any day)
I don't feel pain (ayo, ayo)

[Verse 3: Raekwon & Anderson .Paak]
The shares are hot and the streets are illuminated
Flying last, getting money, driving in some shit of gangster
Winner at the top, keep a glock, toast and pain and kiff
I carry strength, look at the minks in my chain with drops
The untouchables, we are luxurious, blowing PIFF strains
Go with us, find your neck in the strangest turn
I could change, Danny Ainge, the game would move
I help microphones to jump on these flights and get sick
We all do it, don't ruin it, chef is on a crescent in that
Be attentive, I will return for more licks
Ayo, .paak, me and gibbs, we are the monster clique
Do not talk about money unless you get a monster brick (let us pray)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Conqueror King (yes, sir), good author (for the king)
Promise, we are good forever (every day)
However (make him leave), it happens (far)
I don't feel pain (shut up, let us pray)
Main counselor (yes, sir), co -founder (for the king)
My paperwork in order (it is no longer in the case)
However (I can go), it passes (any day)
I don't feel pain (Amen)
[Outro: Anderson .Paak & Freddie Gibbs]
Let us pray
Oh my God
Cut it
Heavy shit, take it easily
In one, two UH
Three, UH, four (I just want justice for Brianna)
In five (in my mother)
Chuck-Chucka, Chucka (I breathe my batteries in Mickey D) Embed
