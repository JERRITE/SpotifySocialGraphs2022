The lord of the heavens lyricsa doses of morphine entered my body
And between asleep and awake
I crossed my mind
My family and all my loved ones
The work and sacrifice
That I became the boss
With my iron eagles
I put them through tons
From Colombia abroad
I was a friend of my people
Maximum posters
The great "lord of heaven" ...
I made a deal with the true partners
I became a drug trafficker
And head of the Juarez Cartel
I made routes where the air ran
Also Trafique Grande
In commercial airplanes
A Sinaloense boss
I got four or five times
Much more dust than others
A single gram did not move
Without having consulted
No one sent alone ...
I became a friend of the Hard of the Government
In my payroll were
High influence general
The business gave me a lot of profit
That reached me and left over
To pay the external debt
I started looking for the DEA
Without having a minimum idea
Where was I get from
Although the gringos allied
To the Zedillo government
They could never with me ...
With my Boeing fleet 7-27
My aircraft for freight
Control air traffic
I was the main supplier of this market
I made the king of white gold
Gane power and respect
I made a world of money
Be for Brazil and Cuba
Leave beautiful memories
My Argentine colleagues
Chileans and Europeans
They were part of my kingdom ...
My beginnings were with my uncle Fonseca
He took care of a wineries
Be for Guadalajara
A disease I get out of school
Beaten by poverty
Stop milking cows
A mystery life
I turned the number one
The great "lord of heaven"
I have never had a government
This operation may
It can be the perfect plan ...
In life I surround me with loyal friends
And try to be kind
With those who were not
Now I hope to sing victory again
And the rest will be history
Injection no longer had effect
I feel a heart
I'm going to take another flight
Maybe never come back
I'm going to get lost in heaven
Without leaving them any clue
In case they look for me again ... You Might Also Likeembed
