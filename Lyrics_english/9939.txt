Ooowwweee Lyrics[Intro: Peewee Longway]
Yeah, them bands that make ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ayy, where you get that beat from?
Bands that make ooh-wee, ooh-wee

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
She got ass, she go ooh-wee
I go deep and make you skeet
Got a new bankroll, racks come neat
My young nigga spinning like jam of the week
Give doses of dick 'til the bitch OD
Bustin' and shaking like ooh-wee
You don't know what you do to me
My bitch on me like jewelry
I'm back to the basics
Who want the weed? I got the P's, woah, woah
Blue M&M, she loving the taste, she back on her knees, woah, woah
[Chorus: Peewee Longway & Money Man]
Make you take off the condom like I wanna feel it
This bitch get you wet like a speedboat
When I'm on a bean, I fuck her the most
Jump out the Demon and hop in the Ghost
It's in my genes, sellin' this dope
Run it up, yeah
In my genes from sellin' this dope
Racks, run it up, yeah
It's in my genes, sellin' this dope
Racks, run it up, yeah
Racks, run it up, yeah
Run it up, yeah

[Verse 2: Money Man]
I hop out a Demon and jump in a Ghost
When you get M's, niggas hate you the most
These niggas knowing, at trapping, the G.O.A.T
These niggas know I got bags for the low
I love when she shaking it, dropping it low
I call up my Arab, he bringing the load
Might lean with the pot, it's finna explode
My bitch from a whole 'nother side of the globe
Hatred is something we do not condone
I hit her two times, then I left her alone
Finessing the bank, I just got me a loan
Finessing T-Mobile, I just got a phone
I know she love me, she hate when I'm gone
When I count up them racks, it be turning her on
Do this shit for my hood, do this shit for my zone
If it ain't 'bout a check, I don't pick up the phone
Pull up on shawty like yeah, yeah
These hoes be ready to go up
All a nigga burn is indo
That drank got me movin' in slow-mo
Pull up to the trap like yeah, yeah
And I got Runtz for the low low
Me talk to 12, that's a no-go
Me go broke, that's a no-no

Yeah, everybody lookin' like ooh-wee
Back of the 'Bach with a three piece
I been havin' threesomes like all week
She want that dick, she call me
She like when I beat it up, real beat
Ex wanna fuck in the back of the big B
Skeleton AP, bitch like ooh-wee
Walk in the club and fuck it up
Poof, ouch, paper cut
I'ma fuck for an hour standing up
Make her bend over and arch it up
She can't take dick, when she do it, just wait (Woah, woah)

[Chorus: Peewee Longway & Money Man]
Make you take off the condom like I wanna feel it
This bitch get you wet like a speedboat
When I'm on a bean, I fuck her the most
Jump out the Demon and hop in the Ghost
