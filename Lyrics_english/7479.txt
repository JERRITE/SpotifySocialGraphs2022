Spiderwebs Lyrics[Verse 1]
You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You got me for your prey
[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but
Leave a message and I'll call you back

[Verse 2]
You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you, "Please let me be"

[Pre-Chorus]
Communication
A telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but
Leave a message and I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls
You might also like[Bridge]
Now it's gone too deep (Now it's gone too deep)
You wake me in my sleep (Wake me in my sleep)
My dreams become nightmares (Dreams become nightmares)
'Cause you're ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but
Leave a message and I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter, matter, matter, matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

[Chorus]
Ooh, spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
It's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter, matter, matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
No matter who calls
No matter who calls
[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back, ha-ha
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back

[Outro]
Oh, it's all your fault (I'm walking into spiderwebs)
No matter who calls (Leave a message and I'll call you back)
I gotta screen my phone calls (I'm walking into spiderwebs)
It's all your fault (Leave a message and I'll call you back)
No matter, matter, matter who calls (I'm walking into spiderwebs)
I screen my phone calls (Leave a message and I'll call you back)
I'm walking into spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back16Embed
