TranslationPortuguêshllehrebelde Lyrics ["Rebel"] letter]

[Verse 1: Anahí, Alfonso]
While my mind travels where you are
My father shouts again
That my future and his peace waste
With my way of being

[Pre-Car 1: Anahí and Alfonso & Rbd]
Although I listen to it, I'm already far from here
I close my eyes and I'm already thinking about you
[Chorus: RBD]
And I am a rebel
When I don't follow others
Yes I am rebellious
When I love you even rage
And I am a rebel
When I don't think the same as yesterday
And I am a rebel
When I play to the skin

[Post-car: Christian]
Yes I am rebellious
Maybe, nobody knows me well

[Verse 2: Christian, Dulce María]
Some of these days I will escape
To play everything for a dream
Everything in life is to lose or win
You have to bet, you have to bet without fear

[Pre-Coro 2: Dulce María and Christian & Rbd]
No matter what they say about me
I close my eyes and I'm already thinking about you

[Chorus: RBD]
And I am a rebel
When I don't follow others
Yes I am rebellious
When I love you even rage
And I am a rebel
When I don't think the same as yesterday
And I am a rebel
When I play to the skin
You Might Also Like [post-car: Anahí]
Yes I am a rebel, maybe

[Instrumental bridge]

[Pre-Coro 2: Dulce María and Christian & Rbd]
No matter what they say about me
I close my eyes and I'm already thinking about you

[Chorus: RBD]
And I am a rebel
When I don't follow others
And I am a rebel
When I love you even rage
And I am a rebel
When I don't think the same as yesterday
And I am a rebel
When I play to the skin
And I am a rebel
When I don't follow others
And I am a rebel
When I love you even rage
And I am a rebel
When I don't think the same as yesterday
And I am a rebel
When I play to the skin
And I am a rebel! (Rebelde, Belde, Belde) 1embed
