My decision (remix) Lyrics [letter of "my decision (remix)"]

[Verse 1: Jhonny Rivera & Andy Rivera]
The decision, the one I took one day
I am wrong, I know, but I have to do it
Maybe, my love, from you missing
You always tangled my love, but I got tired

[Choir: Sebastián Ayala & Andy Rivera]
And I know that I am leaving and that one day I will come back
My pride is great and maybe I will fail
But I have to do everything I tried
And I know that you will say that I do not feel love for you
That another woman fell in love with my heart
But it's a lie and that is well known
I know God
[Interlude: Andy Rivera & Sebastián Ayala]
Tell Sebas
Of course!
Jhonny Rivеra, tell me Andy

[Verse 2: Sebastián Ayala & Jhonny Rivera]
Everything ended, just as it began
For you I made my love, I faced your parents
I left, for your fights I know
For my pelas too, this love died

[Choir: Sebastián Ayala, Andy Rivera & Jhonny Rivera]
And I know that I am leaving and that one day I will come back
My pride is great and maybe I will fail
But I have to do everything I tried
And I know that you will say that I do not feel love for you
That another woman fell in love with my heart
But it's a lie and that is well known
And I know that I am leaving and that one day I will come back
My pride is great and maybe I will fail
But I have to do everything I tried
And I know that you will say that I do not feel love for you
That another woman fell in love with my heart
But it's a lie and that is well known
