Goodbye Sober Day LyricsYour lips say one thing
But the drugs say another
How can I massage
This intergalactic ulcer?

Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
Hello Milky Way

Pin my ear to the wisdom post
Hang me up and drain me dry
Mend my shipwrecked spirit
Lift the veil from my eyes
Goodbye sober day
The years grew wings and flew away
Ghosts of the past become barbarians
Of the future
And I still pity you
Because what you said was true

Goodbye sober day
And hello milky way

May your sun be blown out just like a candle
May your sea burn like tar, fuck
May your sky be rolled up like a scroll
May your blue moon drip with blood

(Scatting)

Huh!
What word would they say
If you went up in smoke?
If I dug you up
And then made soup of your bones?

Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
Goodbye sober day
