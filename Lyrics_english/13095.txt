â€‹salvia plath Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you hate yourself
So let me feed you strawberries
Off a plate I bought from a widow
Who was selling her husband's things
And we'll see if you still hate yourself

[Verse 2]
If you still hate yourself
I'll eat you out for an hour in your room
'Cause I love giving head
[Verse 3]
If you still hate yourself
We'll cut ourselves and swallow
Chunks of broken glass
I don't care about finishing college

[Verse 4]
I'll buy the biggest TV
That my credit card allows me
We'll watch the food network for the rest of our lives

[Outro]
