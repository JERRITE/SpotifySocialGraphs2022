Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words) - 2007 MIX [2021 Remastered] Lyrics[宇多田ヒカル「Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words) [2007 MIX] [2021 Remastered]」の歌詞]

Poets often use many words
To say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem sing

With music and words, I've been playing
For you, I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along
Fly me to the moon

And let me play among the stars
Won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars?
In other words: Hold my hand!
In other words: Darling kiss me!

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!

In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!You might also likeEmbed
