Gun pull lyrics [sample]
Round One

[Intro: Mazen X]
Without violet, there is only Eau de Toilett
So I pull the gun for gravel
You threaten me with everything, so get me all and I show you how the shotgun shoots (Brra)

[Bridge: Mazen X]
It's about para, I'll get us the Euros, Mama, Baba, Vallah
[Part 1: Mazen X]
Looking for nine mille with the nine milli (pr)
Hunter, but today on the run from nine civilians
Earlier chill, but today 'crime thriller
All want respect, I give you Sippi
You want to make money - mainstream
I come with Essener like KC
Rappers are armed with the basey
Cousins ​​are armed like the navy

[Hook: Mazen X]
Coal on land pull
Kripo observes us because we attract stress
Earlier on the meadow with ball play
Pull the bank today and pull gun, [?]
Gun pull, gun pull, [?], Gun pull, gun pull, gun pull, [?]

[Part 2: SNA]
Scratch the curve when my partner pulls gun
Pay yourself when he shoots for his fatherland
Silla and the two Arab bandits
More legendary than Mahatma Gandhi
Let your films, digga
And soon about twenty mille will be safe
Back on the block like [?]
Block boss, cousins, killa
S to the motherfucking [?] Haram
[?] Better than the other like a player, the city, [eleven?]
Make louder, pump 'the songs in the car
Press' on replay, feel the league, the streets
Pull the gun and baller shots into the air
Penetriers German hip-hop, my nuts have pressure
Ah, invite the gun, first warning shot in German rapper, baller
You Might So Like [Hook: Mazen X]
Coal on land pull
Kripo observes us because we attract stress
Earlier on the meadow with ball play
Pull the bank today and pull gun, [?]
Gun pull, gun pull, [?], Gun pull, gun pull, gun pull, [?]

[Part 3: Silla]
Block boss
My outfit planned, down to the smallest detail
The people, they look at me, twenty things at its best (Kush, Kush, Kush)
Advance is there, astronomical numbers
Before you flatten me, my Berlin wins the European Cup
There is no reunion, leave the label, now free of charge
Paper comes in, paper goes out
I feel like the shitty city library
Look at my chain, dogga, fifty giants
Gold around the neck like Olympicics
Double my money, what does the world cost?
The jewelry in my clips, no props
I do what I want - untouched
All of my boys, they are hateful
Earlier on the corner like a street sign
Today you can see on the cover, my platinum grillz
The Benz is refueled, pull my gun
Run into the bank with the ski mask
The banker is afraid, get the Lilanes
I swear, the bitch recognized me again, tfou
[Hook: Mazen X]
Coal on land pull
Kripo observes us because we attract stress
Earlier on the meadow with ball play
Pull the bank today and pull gun, [?]
Gun pull, gun pull, [?], Gun pull, gun pull, gun pull, [?]
