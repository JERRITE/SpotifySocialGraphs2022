If I could lyrics [if I could "]

[Verse 1]
I can not anymore
I've been without dreaming of three days
Already four nights without singing
A good weather without someone to talk to
I don't know if I'm so good or just a little alone and I don't accept it
And a little fear when analyzing
That if I could return the time to some moment
And be sincere to see what I could never see
[Pre-car]
Perhaps
It has happened to me something that has put me to understand me
Perhaps
Is that life has shown me that I don't want another woman
Perhaps
Even too late and do not pretend to listen to me
I have to tell you that you made me very happy

[Chorus]
That if I could turn the earth again and again
I would look for someone with your same eyes
With your same lips, with your mouth
And with your skin
That if I knew how to give time for another little time
To understand
That without you my life no longer feels it
Without you the color turns to black and white
And I know that the distance made me blind at all times
In which I had to see you here
HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM-HMM
HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM-HMM

[Verse 1]
I can not anymore
I've been without dreaming of three days
Already four nights without singing
A good weather without someone to talk to
I don't know if I'm so good or just a little alone and I don't accept it
And a little fear when analyzing

That if I could turn the earth again and again
I would look for someone with your same eyes
With your same lips, with your mouth and with your skin
That if I knew how to give time for another little time
To understand that without you my life no longer feels it
Without you the color turns to black and white
And I know that the distance made me blind at all times
In which I had to see you here
HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM-HMM
HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM, HMM-HMM-HMM

[Chorus]
That if I could turn the earth again and again
I would look for someone with your same eyes
With your same lips, with your mouth and with your skin
That if I knew how to give time for another little time

Without you the color turns to black and white
And I know that the distance made me blind at all times
In which I had to see you here
