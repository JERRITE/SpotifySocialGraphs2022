Tomorrow without you Lyrics [lyrics by "Tomorrow without you"]

[Verse 1]
You tell me not to call you again
What forgot that you are from my life the light
I can't turn off, I'm afraid of loneliness
Without you I am a poor blind man in the dark
A puppet without puppeteer
I am a black cloud that the sky has been lost
I am fire that sinks and turns off in the water
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
[Chorus]
And today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, although it hurts me
And today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, even if I die
(Today)

[Verse 2]
I don't care what your mother says
And what your father thinks either
The only thing that mattered to me
It's to be faithful and give you my love
And how would I like to shout at the four winds
And tell you how much I love you
But that never cared
Why did you go without saying goodbye?
Come, you have to go back and I understand very well
They told you that I don't deserve you, it's fine
What I failed? If you want to kill me
But I gave you the best to love me
All life, my girl, don't get carried away
So say your friends or your mother
You know well what I feel so much for you
That I love you more than anyone
I always love you

Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, although it hurts me
And today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, even if I die

[Verse 3]
You know well that he wants to love you
He despairs because by his side is not '
You won't hurt you because you are your pretty gyal
You are the only one in his life that puts him to tremble
It is that he cannot more, that loneliness is missing
The sadness he, you can heal
Is that he wants to love you, give him a chance
It will fill you with so much love that you will not endure it and

[Chorus]
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, although it hurts me
And today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Without you I'm nothing, I can't
Today, tomorrow without you with my loneliness
Today I tell you goodbye, even if I diembed
