Stop a Blunt (Remix) Lyrics [letter of "Stop a Blunt (remix)" ft. ZIMPLE]

[Intro: Mc Davo, C-Kan, both, Eirian Music]
(Haha) ah, cha–
Party Everyday, Singui-Lari-Lario
Zimple with DHA, the party is daily
It is already from Party Everyday, Singui-Lario
It is the Davo with the C (haha), playing in your neighborhood (Remix)

[Verse 1: mc davo]
Says (haha)
People already know with me what Tranza (Ajá)
Rapeating I have always spent spear (ah)
Your rap looks like authentic shit
That I shit every that my belly hurts (PRRF)
It is seen that your ship does not advance (haha)
I don't know how you do to have hope (haha)
You are Don Ramón, I Lord Barriga (Nah, Nah, Nah)
Do not get asshole, collection arrived
Maybe you need to go to Mass (Wuh!)
Or you need to put a vertim (haha)
Stop throwing those who are above yours
Bastard, you give me sorry and laugh (pew, pew)
People tell me: "Davo, give me chance
To write down, because you are too quick "
Lift your hand the bastard that is stunned
I kill the one who hates me with a smile (haha)
For me it is always the end of Sema '(Wuh!)
I walked on the plane when I wrote this theme
Follow you right, avoid problems (RRA)
Do not play with fire, bastard, that you burn (rra, rra)
I focus on mine, I don't care about the others (Nah)
I finish and you are starting just (huh)
I'm Mexican and I shoot a cream chingo (Wuh)
If you get the Davo is the chalupa and good (JA)
[Verse 2: dharius]
Stop a Blunt, Compa, and stop a baison
You already know that this crazy dog where a good loquerón stops
Here celebrating the union of pure rapper Chingón
That is Rifando solido, always on the stew with rhymes and flow
To me the dogs are left over, the legs open like the Jordan
There are few who achieve it, the course if they fatte it
The one who is the cock, is the cock and already know who is the most cock of the clan
This rola will be eternal with my company Davo, Zimple and C-Kan
Many sure that the stick will shit tomorrow
But they are going to realize in short that this crew or fart wins
We are the owners of the game, we leave the drama behind
It is the sleep team, the Mexican National Team
Greetings for the compadre who smokes from a pure medicine mother
We walk in the riot and there is no dog that bricks, Cristina's envelopes
We bring pure beauty and the best cocaine
Pa 'that move their heads, pure rhyme of the fine

[Chorus: Mc Davo]
Stop a Blunt, uncover the bottle of liquor
I have brought champion attitude
Come on, stop a Blunt, don't get off the plane
And you bring your friends to Can Tón
Stop a Blunt, uncover the bottle of liquor
I have brought champion attitude
Come on, stop a Blunt, don't get off the plane
And you bring your friends to Can Tón (Zimple)

Stop a Blunt, Mamalón, and enjoy the plane
Hearing this collaborate, pure brave dog
C-Kan and Dharius, Zimple and Davo
They gave my clove, I no longer finished it
Diario recorded with a Blunt in the hand
All Marihuano, my Mexican flow
We placed fire what we are
In the end we win when we join
ROLAMOS ONE FOR BREAKFAST
Roasts two to refine the voice
Roast three for stress
ROLAMOS FOUR WITH THE CREW IN THE FOUR
At the cock the contract, I still stand
With a queen who has faith to me
You already know how DVD
Not little by little, fucking? What hubles, what?

[Bridge: Zimple]
Stop a Blunt from which he makes us cough
I returned with those who made myself known
I hugged my pride and I could never defeat it
I started from scratch and I was born again

[Verse 4: c-kan]
Stop a Blunt (one?), Maybe two (mmm) maybe
Better stop three (ah?) What fuck? Take the whole fucking day (cha–)
Because today you smile and stop the police
Not even a review (hehe), I spend an album and I trust me (woh)
Quesadilla of the capital-tal, you do not bring with cheese (JA)
That is why they say "I am not sold", who would fuck them a weight? (LOL)
We already had a chingo (Pu!) If the street gave grammys (–ys)
But we have a mamis chingo throughout Mexico, Colombia and Miami (mmm)
Bring friends to Can Tón, to the neighborhood, not the mansion
Tell them that you go with Davo and C-Kan, with Goku and Vegeta, with Curry and Lebron (Kame Hame Ha)
One thing is spoken, affirm and invent and rhyme pa 'sing their lies (na)
Another thing, record, generate and travel and sing and live it (ah)
CHAMAQUITOS MALACOPA (HEALTH), copy me to clothes (Chale)
They wanted smoking from that speck that I smoke in Colombia, the Gabacho and Europe
It's because they don't support us (of course), not because I don't support them (ah-ah)
Keep speaking shit, when have you noticed that we care? (Bye)
[Chorus: Mc Davo & Eirian Music]
Stop a Blunt, uncover the bottle of liquor
I have brought champion attitude
Come on, stop a Blunt, don't get off the plane
And you bring your friends to Can Tón (haha, remix)

[Outro: MC Davo & C-Kan, C-Kan]
Party Everyday, Singui-Lari-Lario
Zimple with DHA, the party is daily
It is already from Party Everyday, Singui-Lario
It is the Davo with the C ringing in your neighborhood
