Only The Wild Ones Lyrics[Verse 1]
Long hair and longer stride
Skateboard fair with a primal tribe
And your cut off painter pants
Charging down the craggy mountains with our thrift store friends

Who you find so
So in love with the falling earth
Oh, you wake in the middle of the falling night
With the summer playing coy
And in the attics of the city night
We talked Corso and the MC5
And you could dance like
We were all alright

[Chorus]
Only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere
[Verse 2]
One I met in the green mountain state
I dropped out and he moved away
Heard he got some land down south
Changed his name to a name the birds could pronounce

[Chorus]
Only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere
(No place to go but everywhere)
You might also like[Verse 3]
And in the city the mayor said
Those who dance are all mislead
So you packed your things and moved to the other coast
Said you gonna be like Charlie Rose
[Chorus]
Only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere

Only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but anywhere3Embed
