BLADETUCKEDFACEFUCK Lyrics[Intro]
LUCY

[Chorus]
Better pray when you see me today
You a bitch, I can see it by the look on your face
Blood drip from your body, I just want me a taste
See you writhe, your demise is what I solely crave, aye
Better pray when you see me today
You a bitch, I can see it by the look on your face
Blood drip from your body, I just want me a taste
See you writhe, your demise is what I solely crave, aye
[Bridge]
Better pray when you see me today
You a bitch, I can see it by the look on your face
Blood drip from your body, I just want me a taste
See you writhe, your demise is what I solely crave, aye

[Hook]
Blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked
Blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked

Aye, blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked
Blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked
Blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked
Blade tucked, blade tucked
I keep that blade tucked
Face-fucked, face-fucked
You getting face-fucked
