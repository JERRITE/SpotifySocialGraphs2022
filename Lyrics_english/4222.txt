Alone lyrics ["alone" ft letter. Plan B]

[Verse 1: Tony dize & cencho corleone]
He told me: "It was late, the sun is no longer seen" (so?)
And to do a favor, OH-OH-OH
To take her home to get alcohol (Pina Records)
To get to know us better
Corny realized that she had a plan
Crazy life, for her that is normal
Chencho offered him fire, well charlatan and so I offered to beâ€”
[Choir: Tony Dize & Chencho Corleone]
Alone
Minding 'in the eye
Losing us for a while
Just as they all do
Crazy in just minutes
Deciphering the whole matter
Because I want to 'be together
Until time ends and nothing happens

[Verse 1: Maldy]
Those smell 'make this dog fall in love
I like your guille and how you dance my song '
Nice face, look like hunting Leone '
I like your blouse, also your 'mahone'
You have me 'full, ma', from illusion '
Crazy to try you, by sharing Amoe '
The most I like when you release your hair
When you express me, mommy, your desires

[Choir: Tony Dize & Chencho Corleone]
Alone
Minding 'in the eye
Losing us for a while
Just as they all do
Crazy in just minutes
Deciphering the whole matter
Because I want to 'be together
Until time ends and nothing happens

Without knowing your name, you will be your man
I already told you where, well, I'm hungry
I know what it wants to do it, I could understand it
You lost control of your body
And there is only one kisses of those, to lose your calm
But it puts me but 'And the adventure calls us
Your body in the distance speaks (haha)
Say, tell me your drama

[Verse 3: Tony dize]
I'm still fierce
The night was late and I still in his game
Treating 'and take away your shyness
In order to contemplate your nakedness
I tried to kiss her and dodged me
Anxious, with the desire left me
Although he didn't have that guille, I hit him and said

[Choir: Tony Dize & Chencho Corleone]
Alone
Minding 'in the eye
Losing us for a while, oh-oh
Just as they all do
Crazy in just minutes
Deciphering the whole matter
Because I want to 'be together
Until time ends and nothing happens
[Outro: Chencho Corleone & Tony Dize]
