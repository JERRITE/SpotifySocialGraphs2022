Bitter sugar lyrics [verse 1]
Something you want to hide
I don't know what is
And it hurts me
Please do not put between you and me
Doubts that for today
Can separate us

[Verse 2]
Answer me
Although it hurts tell me why
They don't shine the same as yesterday
The pupils, when you look at me
[Verse 3]
You lie, I know you well
It is clear that something is changing
Speak, don't run away from me
At close range I saw
WHAT IS WHAT HAVE YOU THAT
Visibly agitated

[Pre-car]
On the altar of my particular creed
Nothing, nobody cares more
That the music of your lips

[Chorus]
You are bitter sugar
Delirium and sin
A surprise chest
You arrive, you kiss me and

You are bitter sugar
An angel and a devil
Damn Embustero
I just feel, I'm losing you

[Verse 3]
I hate, have to be
Who forces you to give
This first step
If there is someone apart from me
Right and here we cut into healthy
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
I will get rid of, inside I will get rid of
Of pain, but I will not give
For stopping or a single step

[Chorus]
You are bitter sugar
Delirium and sin
A surprise chest
You arrive, you kiss me and

You are bitter sugar
An angel and a devil
The man I want
But I feel that I don't have you anymore

[Pre-car]
On the altar of my particular creed
You have always been the best, the most
The mirror in which I look

[Chorus]
You are bitter sugar
Delirium and sin
A surprise chest
You arrive, you kiss me and
You are bitter sugar
An angel and a devil
Damn Embustero
How it hurts to know what I lose you

Bitter sugar
Delirium and sin
A surprise chest
You arrive, you kiss me and

You are bitter sugar
An angel and a devil
Damn Embustero
How it hurts to know what I lose you1embed
