All About Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I bought a new pair of shoes
I got a new attitude, when I walk
'Cause I'm so over you
And it's all about tonight
I'm going out with the girls
Ready to show all the boys what I got
I'm letting go of the hurt
'Cause it's all about tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet
It's all about tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah we'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight

[Verse 2]
And boy, I'm not hanging on
'Cause I threw all your drama away
Had something good but it's gone (oh oh, oh, oh)
Yeah it's all about tonight
They got the music so loud (so loud, so loud)
So I won't I hear the phone if you call (call, call, call)
And we're so over now (so over now)
'Cause it's all about tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat (feel the heartbeat)
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week (working all week)
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet (oh)
It's all about tonight (whoa oh oh oh oh)
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight

[Bridge]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight...

[Chorus]
Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week (working all week, yeah)
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet (moving your feet)
It's all about tonight (it's all about tonight!)

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't, d-d
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonightEmbed
