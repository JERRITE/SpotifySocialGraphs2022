Slowly LyricsDo you believe in love?
How crazy it could be
Baby baby stop
Hmm take it easy
When you leave
I swear I can’t breathe
Do you really care? Baby
Niba unkunda
Nkomeza
You’re my fantasy
My only desire
Kugutekereza nijoro
Bituma ntasinzira
Cause you make me fall in love
Darling
Darling
If you touch me one more time
I might loose my mind
Baby it’s too much
Can we go slowly?
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it

Give me your, attention
Cause you got ma, affection
Baby baby nza, gutetesha
Tubyina step by step
On the beat
Tujyana hand in hand
In the street
Ndirimba
Aaah aaaaah aaaaah
Singing haaahaaaahaaaa

You’re my fantasy
My only desire
Kugutekereza nijoro
Bituma ntasinzira
Cause you make me fall in love
Darling
Darling
If you touch me one more time
I might loose my mind
Baby it’s too much
Can we go slowly?
You might also likeCause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it

Aaaaah aaaah aaha

Aaahaah aaah aaaha
Aaaahaaahaaaa Aaaahaaahaaaa
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
Cause I can’t take it
