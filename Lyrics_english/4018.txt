Lyrics overdose ["Overdose" letter ft. Ozuna]

[Intro: Romeo Santos]
What is the mystery between your legs
That crazy my sanity, uh
You are a volcano of sensations
Each cell in your being composes ricura

[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
And I can die
On top of your body
Tied to your bed
Sex overdose
[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
You are the most divine sin
A sex viper in fever
I amazed me with your perverse techniques
If you see you will censor your waist
Retire it by feeling your narcotic effect
That my pesos of pleasure so intense are exploited to me

[Verse 2: Ozuna, Romeo Santos]
(Ozuna)
Love it to your back, I lend myself
In your school give me class' of pleasure
Baby, I want to be a student on your chest
I'm going back to my childhood
I want to die inside you, I swear that God forgives me
If being with you is a crime I will do a thousand years in prison
You already guessed the my nymphomaniac crossword in flames
You know well I'm beautiful and you are provocation
(Who's back?)
(I tried to tell 'em)

[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
And I can die
On top of your body
Tied to your bed
Sex overdose

(Tell me)
Love it behind your back, I lend myself
In your school give me class' of pleasure
Baby, I want to be a student on your chest
I'm going back to my childhood
I want to die inside you, I swear that God forgives me
If being with you is a crime I will do a thousand years in prison
You already guessed the my nymphomaniac crossword in flames
You know well I'm beautiful and you are provocation
(Tasty)

[Bridge: Romeo Santos, Ozuna]
Savage (You are)
Erotic, an aberration
And I will be your slave
And if it's by your side (I'm happy)

[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
And I can die
On top of your body
Tied to your bed
