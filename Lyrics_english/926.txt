Lyrics wetting ["Mojadero" letter]

Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero
When you see me 'it seems that' tá raining
(Wup-wup; lu' -u ', lu' -u'-lunay, -ay, -Ay)

When you see me 'it seems that' tá raining
Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero
When you see me 'it seems that' tá raining
Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero, Mojadero (c'mon!)

But you can't 'tie'
Because it's me that I have it Amarrá '

[Verse 2: Lunay]
No one is given for free
It has that culito Flow Nasty (RRR)
But the chain grabs me and bends down
And the other 'with the X dispatches them
I get to the album
And the wipe was formed (no one enters, there is no one, no one)
It is a luxury to be with me
My bug is worth money (you know it ', you know it', woh)
With me always gets wet '(Skrr')
I want to collide even though the lu 'is red
Pa 'what relaxes you' I brought you a sheet
Complete muevela, for the jeepeta who wants to 'choose it'
I buy it to you (Sha, Sha, Sha)
But first take me the Levis, that's what I want
I arrived last (wuh) to the genre (Wuh)
But in the 'bet' I am always first

Put it in 'Atrá', which I like to see you back
How you move it ', mommy, I love it
The sheet that you have 'makes me high
For you I spend what I have and what I lack, he says
I like how you move it ', your movement entertains me
Tonight the 'A Pasá' in my house through the downpour
Give it, I like how you move 'that sheet (huh, eh, eh)
And he says, give him, I like how you move 'that sheet (huh, eh)
(The downpour)
