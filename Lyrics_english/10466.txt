TranslationsEspa√±olIs It Cold in the Water? Lyrics[Verse 1: Cecile Believe]
I'm freezing
I'm burning
I've left my home
Soft ache, me
Earth shaking
I feel alone

[Chorus 1: Cecile Believe]
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
[Verse 2: Cecile Believe]
I'm falling
Depths endless
Worlds turn to smoke
One hundred years flicker
I kiss the snow

[Chorus 2: Cecile Believe]
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
I'm swimming, I'm breathing, evaporating
Is it cold in the water?
I'm liquid, I'm floating into the blueYou might also like15Embed
