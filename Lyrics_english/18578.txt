Baby Blue Eyes Lyrics[Intro]
Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby blue eyes
You light the night skies
It's clearer than the water
So happy that I saw ya
Ooh baby blue eyes
Trying harder to disguise
Oh, my heart is beating faster
Hoping for a happy ever after
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what to do
So crazy over you
Nothing gonna stop me getting through

[Chorus]
There's no where left to run
Stop and see that I'm the one
Won't go without a fight
There's a roof for us tonight
And I could be your everything
Your start, your end, your in-between
Can't help but fantasize
Staring in those baby blue eyes, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
A little bird told me
You're the honey and I'm the bee
Dip your toe in the water
Good times just around the corner
I'm not the devil you know
You're all dressed up, nowhere to go
Let me lift you out of this
Seal the future with a kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what to do
I'm crazy over you
Nothing gonna stop me getting through
You might also like[Chorus]
There's no where left to run
Stop and see that I'm the one
Won't go without a fight
There's a roof for us tonight
And I could be your everything
Your start, your end, your in-between
Can't help but fantasize
Staring in those baby blue eyes

[Bridge]
The windows to your soul
Open up and I'll fall
Baby, baby, baby, please
Honey, why can't you see?
Those eyes are killing me
Oh, staring at mine
Set us free

[Chorus]
There's no where left to run
Stop and see that I'm the one
Won't go without a fight
There's a roof for us tonight
And I could be your everything
Your start, your end, your in-between (In-between)
Can't help but fantasize
Staring in those baby blue eyes, ooh, ooh
Staring in those baby blue eyes, ooh, ooh
Staring in those baby blue eyes, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
