Amsterdam Lyrics [The lyrics "Amsterdam"]

[Intro]
Ohm, ohm
Sadness will disappear
On the day when
The holiday will come
Ohm, ohm
And my path
He will bring
Me where
[Verse 1]
My hands will roll up in a wild dance, squeezes my head, eyes
The back will be replaced by the shell, I will go into the gap
In the city of Freedom
Absolute ligalasis
We do not need a hotel at night
On suitcases for three years in anticipation of adventure, but
Put off, decided
And I believed - he is waiting for me

[Chorus]
On the way to Amster
People, as I drove
So I wanted to get
And land in your fog
But while waiting for
He changed his life
Look who I became
On the way to Amster, on the way to Amsterdam

[Verse 2]
I performed this under Sinka - I was brotherly with anyone
Became bad and conflict
He ended with alcohol
And suddenly things went
Ganja was kind and wise
But even more lazy and drove into such a gap
Panic attacks -
They will not bring to good
I don't pursue health
You just stop me with dick when everything is in bulk
Therefore, I chose a way to cut down
Even chips and hookahs fell under the distribution
Here I am standing here, at the coffee shop, with a bicycle
I bought a ring, give my beloved when I arrive
Amster, I'm sorry, I arrived, but the blasphemy?
I was forbidden, I wanted to drive, now I am chasing Van Gogh
You might also like [chorus]
On the way to Amster
People, as I drove
So I wanted to get
And land in your fog
But while waiting for
He changed his life
See who I became
On the way to Amster, on the way to Amsterdam

[Verse 3]
But what if you really really need:
Wake up with a fresh head in the morning?
Who said the weekend should be like that?
The generation of idiotic clips and films
Blind, dependent animal world of entertainment
Made us more submissive and stupid
I tried, and now I can tell you this way:
From a sober life, the attic is even more undermined

[Bridge]
The day will come, sadness will leave
At the moment I am untie
The day will come, I'll be back to you
In the animal world, on the way
[Chorus]
On the way to Amster
People, as I drove
So I wanted to get
And land in your fog
But while waiting for
He changed his life
Look who I became
On the way to Amster, on the way to Amsterdam

[Autro]
Amster, Amster, Amster
Where are you now, where are you now, Amster?
Amster, Amster, Amster
Where are you now, where are you now? 4Embed
