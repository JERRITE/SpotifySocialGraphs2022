Even If It Hurts Lyrics[Verse 1]
You blink once, then it's gone
Don't let it take the skin from your bones
It's darkest before the dawn
But you don't need to do this alone
No you don't
'Cause when you get this close, you can feel the heat
Now you're so afraid of what's underneath
Oh, don't

[Chorus]
Even if it hurts
Even if it makes me bleed
I'm gonna carry you
Pushing through
With the dirt on my sleeves
Even if it hurts
Even if it's razor deep
I'm not giving up, not gonna run
I'll be there when you need me
Even if it hurts
Even if it hurts
[Verse 2]
These nails in my hands
Erasing all the lines in the sand
I've got no regret
'Cause if I could I'd do it over again, again

[Chorus]
Even if it hurts
Even if it makes me bleed
I'm gonna carry you
Pushing through
With the dirt on my sleeves
Even if it hurts
Even if it's razor deep
I'm not giving up, not gonna run
I'll be there when you need me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even if it hurts (no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no)
Even if it hurts (no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no)

[Verse 3]
Not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
How long will it take
For you to lean on me?
Time to let it go
So you can finally breathe
Slow, slow
You might also like[Chorus]
Even if it hurts
Even if it makes me bleed
I'm gonna carry you
Pushing through
With the dirt on my sleeves
Even if it hurts
Even if it's razor deep
I'm not giving up, not gonna run
I'll be there when you need me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even if it hurts (no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no)
Even if it hurts (no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no
Yeah, yeahEmbed
