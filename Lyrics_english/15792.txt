I was wrong Lyrics [letter of "I was wrong" ft. The Kanka]

[Chorus: Sharif & Mxrgxn]
I do not regret
If I got lost
It was a matter of time
The road took here

I do not regret
If I got lost
It was a matter of time
The road took here
[Verse 1: Kanka]
I think to stumble with another stone
Intoxicate with the ivy
And bet the heart
Who does not arrive who does not yerra does not come to fruition
Does not walk the one who clings
Only the one who failed
If I wore it was for pure accident
If I succeeded it was suddenly
I arrived by chance
I am looking for new mistakes
Well, the placebos do not go
I want to live really

[Verse 2: Sharif]
It may happen that there is no fate
What's just ash of stars
That in this weird world there is no other way
That the one who leaves behind the footprints ...
Those who kiss your feet when taking every step
On this path of joy and fears
We have victories and we have failures
Experience is a handful of errors

[Choir: Kanka & the mortgage boy]
I was wrong
I would be wrong again
And you got it right
You might also like I was wrong
I would be wrong again
And you got it right

[Verse 3: The mortgage boy]
I never read the instructions
I was absent in the lessons
I didn't listen to your opinion
Always begging solutions
Giving confusion
High precision failures
I spend time to trompicones
Looking up in balconies
That turn their backs on the sea
And in the desktop my mistakes
They taught me that with you
I will not go wrong

[Verse 4: mxrgxn]
If one thing has learned my gray heart
In this tour of contradirection
Is that, stumbling
My feet managed to take me to the place where I am
And as a teacher who spider my skin
I learned from error when I was wrong
If I could be born again
I would fail again
[Choir: Kanka & the mortgage boy]
I was wrong
I would be wrong again
And you got it right

I was wrong
I would be wrong again
And you got it right

[Choir: Kanka and the mortgage boy, Sharif & Mxrgxn]
I was wrong (I don't regret)
I would be wrong again (if I got lost)
And you got it right (it was a matter of time)
The road took here

I was wrong (I don't regret)
I would be wrong again (if I got lost)
And you got it right (it was a matter of time)
The road took here
