Be or look like lyrics [verse 1: Anahí & Dulce María]
Be or seem who can imagine
I can't make me the owner of your life
If you don't look at me, baby
I tried a lot to raise my voice
For arouseing empty interest
What does mine, baby

[Pre-Car 1: Anahí]
And I know that maybe day
It never happens to me (happen)
[Chorus: All]
But you in my dreams must always be
Like a light that illuminates me
And when I wake up I want to try again
I know that the heart beats strongest, more than an engine
And although you don't know anything about me
One day I will reach you, love

[Verse 2: Maite, Anahí and Dulce María & Anahí]
When I succeeded and I approached you
I froze, my nerves killed me
I didn't say anything, baby
Another day I convinced myself to speak
I saw you pass with another very happy
It wasn't the time, Baby

[Pre-Car 2: Dulce María]
How did it happen that I am crazy?
So in love, ah (in love, ah)

[Chorus: All]
But you in my dreams must always be
Like a light that illuminates me
And when I wake up I want to try again
I know that the heart beats strongest, more than an engine
And although you don't know anything about me
One day I will reach you, love

Seeing you without speaking is a cruel suffering
That suddenly disappears when I think about you
Flying to my side, hanging from a feeling
The days that pass or die in the attempt do not matter
Take it back-ah-ah-ar ...

[Chorus: All, Christian, Alfonso and Christopher & Anahí]
But you in my dreams must always be
Like a light that illuminates me
And when I wake up I want to try again
I know that the heart beats strongest, more than an engine
And although you don't know anything about me
One day I will reach you, love

But you in my dreams must always be
As a light that illuminates me (again tries-ah-ah-ar ...)
And when I wake up I want to try again, I
I know that the heart beats stronger, more than an engine
And although you don't know anything about me
One day I will reach you, love

[Outro: Anahí]
Be or seem who can imagine
Be or seem who can imagine
Be or seem who can imagine
