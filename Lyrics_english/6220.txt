Hope For The Future Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, it's not that late
You came here for a moment of love
Just a bit of space
A change here from the city of love

[Pre-Chorus]
I wrote your name down on the hillside in my mind
I wrote your name down

[Chorus]
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath (with every breath)
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
Woah-oh
[Verse 2]
The breeze here always stirs
The grasses of your memories alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I wrote your name down
On the hillside in my mind
I wrote your name down

[Chorus]
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head (here in my head)
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
Woah-oh

[Bridge]
Thought that I could hear you whisper softly
Canâ€™t be only me that hears the sound
But it's the ones in charge who write the history each time

[Chorus]
And oh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath (I breathe a little deeper with every breath)
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head (I keep a picture, I keep a picture)
