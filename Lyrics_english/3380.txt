Ho, I look so clean and them motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong, but shit, you leave me with no option
Yeah, yeah
Everybody askin', "Post, when is the album droppin'?"
Ever since the very first day at it, I been poppin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong, but shit, you leave me with no option
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, swingin' with a four-door
Now they takin' photos
Bottles, we need more of those, ooh
Say she been to every show
Yeah, even on the road
And she always be in front row, ooh, yeah
Everything that I worked for
Waited so long to get on
The Caddy just sits on the chrome
I swang through on dubs on the four
[Chorus]
Baby wanna get in this S-Class (S-Class)
Little mama, she just wanna go fast (Go fast)
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass (Free pass)
So I told her, "Ass, gas, or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shinin'
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Refrain]
Ho, I look so clean and them motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong, but shit, you leave me with no option
Yeah, yeah (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Now she hoppin' in a old-school
Swimmin' in the carpool
Everything is all cool, ooh
Yeah, she told me not to tell
'Bout the rumors that I heard
She said, "Everything was all true," yeah

[Chorus]
Baby wanna get in this S-Class (S-Class)
Little mama, she just wanna go fast (Go fast)
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass (Free pass)
So I told her, "Ass, gas, or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shinin'
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby wanna get in this S-Class (S-Class)
Little mama, she just wanna go fast (Go fast)
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass (Free pass)
So I told her, "Ass, gas, or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shinin'
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Outro]
So come hop in that, ooh
What do you wanna do?
Put that dime in my coupe
With that gold on my tooth
Ooh, yeah22Embed
