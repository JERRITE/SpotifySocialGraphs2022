The bit lyrics [lyrics by "La mordidita" ft. Me you him]

[Intro: Ricky Martin]
IHHH-I!
IHHH-YE!

[Verse 1: Ricky Martin]
The bell rang and the weekend is seen
(Sha-la-La, la-la-la)
Dress, in a suit, wild lust under my skin
[Pre-Caro: Ricky Martin]
If God put the apple it went to bite
Oh my God! Small 'hugging until dawn

[Choir: Ricky Martin]
The party arrived, for your little mouth
All night, all the day
Vamo 'to bathe in the Orillita
That the tide is pica'ita -ita

[Post-Coro: Ricky Martin]
A bit, a bite
A bit, your little mouth
A bit, a bite
A bit, your little mouth

[Verse 2: Ricky Martin]
Your lips, my teeth
Crispy bite, rich cake
Fire in your pupils, your body distils tequila and honey

[Pre-Caro: Ricky Martin]
If God put the apple it went to bite
Oh my God! Small 'hugging until dawn

[Choir: Ricky Martin]
The party arrived, for your little mouth
All night, all the day
Vamo 'to bathe in the Orillita
That the tide is pica'ita -ita

A bit, a bite
A bit, your little mouth
A bit, a bite
A bit, your little mouth

[Verse 3: Yotuel]
I want to think, you're not real
It seems natural, lethal, so you get dancing
Don't brake when you sweat
Vamo 'to Low, to feel your flow
To teach you girl, to get attention
Keeps you in tension, without lowering the pressure
Sweat has a cure to stop tension

[Bridge: Ricky Martin]
Let me bite you, I'm vampire very insane
Let me bite you, I swear and if people
Let me bite you, well slowly and look for me
Let me bite you, tarradito well insane

[Choir: Ricky Martin]
The party arrived, for your little mouth
All night, all the day
Vamo 'to bathe in the Orillita
That the tide is pica'ita -ita
[Post-Coro: Ricky Martin]
A bit, a bite
A bit, your little mouth
A bit, a bite
A bite
It's pica'ita -ita -ita
It's pica'ita -ita -ita

[Choir: Ricky Martin]
The party arrived, for your little mouth
All night, all the day
Vamo 'to bathe in the Orillita
That the tide is Pica'ita -ita -ita4embed
