Bad fame Lyrics ["Bad Fame" letter]

[Verse 1]
Fame, they say I have a bad reputation
That I fell in love at night
And it passes me in the morning (ah)
Blame, I'm sorry I'm not to blame
That do not give me enough
I am demanding and the children are scared (mm)

[Pre-car]
The first thing is that it is single
With brain would be the two
That is good goes from third
And incidentally have a good mood
[Chorus]
So, yes
Yes I want for me, me
When I find it, I don't
No, I don't let him go from here
So, yes
Yes I want for me, me
When I find it, I don't
No, no, I don't leave it
Look no, I don't let go (no)

[Post-car]
That if I left with Maluma, no
They say Yatra and Ozuna, no
I sleep alone in my bed
And I'm not worried about my bad reputation

[Verse 2]
I do what I want if I feel like
I don't look for a weekend Romeo
That the stars sell me without taking me to heaven
The false promises are taken by the wind

[Verse 3]
Fly that flies that was lost
If there is a culprit that is not me
If I say it's not because I don't want
But I don't put a but (no, no, no, no)
Fly that flies that was lost (lost, oh)
If there is a culprit that is not me
If I say it's not because I don't want
But to the indicated ...
