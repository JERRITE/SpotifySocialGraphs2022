Punch22 Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's another new year and I think I'm starting to figure it out
Your friends and my friends, the same friends, start hanging out
The days turn to weeks turn to months, we gotta slow down
Everyone's in sync and lost dancing in the crowd

[Chorus]
I'll give you everything I have
I swear I'll be a better man
Punch me in the gut just one more time
New Year's, don't you know that I'm used to it?
[Verse 2]
Think what you want about me, but I ain't comin' down
I had a terrible week and a permanent frown
All these different people tellin' me they'll turn it around
I'm just gonna scream until people start hearing me shout

[Chorus]
I'll give you everything I have
I swear I'll be a better man
Punch me in the gut just one more time
New Year's, don't you know that I'm used to it?

[Outro]
I'll give you everything I have
I swear I'll be a better man
Punch me in the gut just one more time
New Year's, don't you know that I'm used to it?You might also likeEmbed
