TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsLie to Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
I saw you looking brand new overnight
I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right
[Chorus: Luke, Luke & Calum]
And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
It's 3 A.M. and the moonlight's testing me (Ooh, aah-aah)
If I can make it till dawn, then it won't be hard to see (Ooh, aah-aah)
That I ain't happy, oh, mmm-mmm
I ain't too happy, oh, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Problem was I thought I had this right

[Chorus: Luke, All]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
