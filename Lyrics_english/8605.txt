Fat Bottomed Girls (Live in Paris) Lyrics[Intro: Freddie & Roger]
Okay, okay, this is called, uh, "Fat Bottomed Girls"
(Uh one, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
Hey!
[Verse 1]
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery (Huh)
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Hey, hey-hey-hey, right? Ayy, alright
Fat bottomed girls, go-go-go-go, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I’ve been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way (Hey)
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, when you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin’ world go round
You might also like[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now I got mortgages and homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
I tell you
Oh, well, I still got my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Big woman, you gon' make a big man of me
Now hear this

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? (Hey)
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round (Yeah)
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round

[Outro]
Get on your bikes and ride ...
Ride 'em cowboy
Ride 'em! Come on, ready, go
That's the way I like it, yeah, yes, yes
You fat bottomed girls
You like 'em, you ride 'em, ooh
Ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, alright
Fat bottomed girls
One more time, girls
Yeah, yeah
Alright!
Yeah! oh-oh
They get me, they get me, they get me, they get me, get me, get me, get meEmbed
