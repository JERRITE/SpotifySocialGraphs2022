Me4U Lyrics[Intro]
For you, y-y-you, you, you
For you, y-y-you, you, you
For you, y-y-you, you, you
For me, for

[Verse 1]
Took a long time to find you
And I won’t let you get away, always
You’re the sunrise in the darkness
Boy, you take my breath away, always
[Chorus]
For me, for you, y-y-you, you, you
You’re the only one that I belong to
Every part of me is a part of you
Everything I do, d-d-do, do, do

For me, for you, y-y-you, you, you
You’re the only one that I belong to
Every part of me is a part of you
Everything I do, d-d-do, do, do

For me, for you, y-y-you, you, you
For y-y-you, you, you
For y-y-you, you, you
For y-y-you, you, you
For me, for

[Verse 2]
Your love keeps me moving
And makes a sound I never could, always
Because your love has a magic
And no one makes me feel so good, always

[Chorus]
For me, for you, y-y-you, you, you
You’re the only one that I belong to
Every part of me is a part of you
Everything I do, d-d-do, do, do
