Pacific Grove - Alternate Version Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you've been away for a long time
Feels like ten years or more
It's got me to thinking I shouldn't have said
All those things I regret even more now

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling sentimental
Times I'm living for the past
Pull your face before my eyes
But it never seems to last
[Chorus]
So let's go back to Pacific Grove
When those monarchs come back home
I know I won't make it alone
With love and laughing and tapping
When that evening sun goes down
And meet halfway in Pacific Grove

[Verse 3]
At times my mind did wander
Like a bird from limp to limp
Wake up early but who am I fooling
There's no one next to me

[Verse 4]
And there on the misty street
Is that neon light we know
Often Iâ€™ve longed for your silhouette
Glowing inside that window

[Chorus]
Let's go back to Pacific Grove
When those monarchs come back home
I know I won't make it alone
With love and laughing and tapping
When that evening sun goes down
And meet halfway in Pacific Grove
You might also likePacific Grove
Pacific Grove

[Verse 5]
Now if you're loving someone new
If that fountain's overflowing
I get the feeling that I'm on the banks
Warring as a river stone

[Verse 6]
I know you've been away for a long time
Feels like ten years or more
It got me to thinking I shouldn't have said
All those things I regret even more now

[Chorus]
Let's go back to pacific grove
When those monarchs come back home
I know I won't make it alone
With love and laughing and tapping
When that evening sun goes down
And meet halfway in Pacific Grove
We'll meet halfway in Pacific Grove

[Outro]
