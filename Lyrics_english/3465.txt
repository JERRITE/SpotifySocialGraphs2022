Strapped Lyrics[Chorus]
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life

[Verse 1]
In the same old house on the same old couch
What I'm doing all day, I need to go out
It's the only way out, it's the only way out for me
Every time you don't see it
I'm falling on my knees just to please you
Believe me, I'm strapped so tight I'm bleeding (I'm bleeding)
Yeah, turn off your phone and turn up your life
See that outside's better than your couch time
[Chorus]
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat calledâ€“
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life

[Verse 2]
Baby, for this moment I've been tryna open up this conversation
But you keep on rolling, rolling weed up
Man, I don't believe her, she's colder than a freezer
She keeps turning the cheek and I wonder why?
People walking by, they never mind
And I really tried, but they never mind
Turn off your phone and turn up your life
See that outside's better than your couch time

[Chorus]
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called life
People walking by, walking by
They don't wonder why, they don't wonder why
Seat belt strapped too tight, trapped in a seat called lifeYou might also like1Embed
