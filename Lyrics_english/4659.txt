I WANT YOU BUT YOU’LL NEVER KNOW... Lyrics[Intro]
Always been worse than physical cheating
Like confiding into a bitch is way worse than I think just fucking
Yeah
So
What we was talking about out there?

[Verse 1: Shelley FKA Dram]
Just take a breather sometimes
'Cause I want it
But can't have it
You swear I stay acting
Just believe me sometimes
I'm really gonna call you
Just gotta stay patient, don't argue
I'm saying anything to stall you
Girl, as soon as I touch down
I'm touching you and only you
But whenever I gotta go
You make it so uncomfortable
[Chorus: Shelley FKA Dram]
I want you more than you know
I might love you, but you'll never know
I want you more than you know
I might love you, but you'll never know

[Verse 2: Alex Isley]
I don't mean to bother but I needed to call you
I don't care you'rе with her
I guess I'll try back tomorrow
Can't help that I miss you
Ask hеr, what's the issue with sharing your heart, your body parts and your mental?
'Cause I'm feeling nasty
Feel really nasty
I'll drive to you, I remember your street
I can really use some 'cause it's been a long week
And that buzz on your phone is just little ol' me
Not asking, like I did the last time
I'm telling you but you pay me no mind
Your woman is a really good one
How you laying with me if you saying?

[Chorus: Alex Isley]
I want you (I want you) more than you know (I want more than you now)
I might love you, but you'll never know (No, you'll never know)
I want you (I want you, I want you) more than you know (More than you know)
I might love you (I might love you, baby), but you'll never know (You'll never know)
Oh, I want you but
More than you know
More than you know
I might love you, baby
But you'll never know, never know, never knowYou might also likeEmbed
