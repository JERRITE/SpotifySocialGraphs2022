There’s Still A Light In The House Lyrics[Chorus]
I'd like to call you on the way home
Another precious call to waste on my mouth
My chance is tugging me by the shoulder
But there's no one home to let you in or let me out
(There's still a light in the house)

[Verse 1]
I saw a face so close to mine in Chelsea Market
There's something about her and there's something about it
There's a million ways to pass the day on a concrete island
We try to get past it, just stuck in the traffic
[Pre-Chorus]
Swing your conscience, pull the lever
Maybe talking's not the feature
(There's still a light in the house)

[Chorus]
I'd like to call you on the way home
Another precious call to waste on my mouth
My chance is tugging me by the shoulder
But there's no one home to let you in or let me out
(There's still a light in the house)
(There's still a light in the house)

[Verse 2]
It's such a waste to watch you slide out in the hallway
And break down in the housing on the street end apartment
We share a ride 'cause you're alone and in the same clothes
With the blur of the tunnel and the blur of the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing your conscience, pull the lever
Maybe talking's not the feature
(There's still a light in the house)

[Chorus]
I'd like to call you on the way home
Another precious call to waste on my mouth
My chance is tugging me by the shoulder
But there's no one home to let you in or let me out
(There's still a light in the house)
(There's still a light in the house)
(There’s still a light in the house)
You might also like[Bridge]
When she cries, she brings a storm in
I kinda like the way it pours
3 o'clock I'm callin' Anna
She's telling me, "C'mon, move on"
In the Brooklyn light, we're just passer-bys
Your hands on my shoulder, it all feels right
'Cause you found me there with your new cut hair
"Is it New York? Or Heaven?"
"I can't think twice now"

[Chorus]
I'd like to call you on the way home
Another precious call to waste on my mouth (I can't think twice now)
(Maybe talking's not the feature)
My chance is tugging me by the shoulder
But there's no one home to let you in or let me out (I can't think twice now)
(There's still a light in the house)Embed
