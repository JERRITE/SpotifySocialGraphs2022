All My Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everything I've done in my life is walk a little more
We've been raised in the same world with all those different colors
Everything I've done in my life is walk a little more
I walk through the pain and joy that gives the years over my back

[Chorus]
All my days I'll be trying
All my days I'll be trying

[Verse 2]
On and off the road I try to keep my clocks on time
It's the only way I've got to make sure that I am not lost
On and off the road I work to keep your love on top
It's the only way for me to be as strong as I'd like to be
[Chorus]
All my days I'll be trying
All my days I'll be trying

[Outro]
I'll try a little harder
Try a little, little, little stronger
Try a little, little, little harder
Try a little, little, little more
I'll try a little harder
Try a little, little, little stronger
Try a little, little, little harder
Try a little, little, little more
Oh, got to try
Gotta try, I got to try, got to try
Gotta try, I got to try, got to try
Gotta try, I got to
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, noYou might also likeEmbed
