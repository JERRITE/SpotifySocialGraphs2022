Take to the Sky LyricsAll of your life you've been waiting
Keeping your feet on the ground
So much that you've never seen
It's just been a dream and until now

Everyone knows it's your moment
The magic you need is in sight
So go out and follow your heart
Make all your dreams come to life

Take to the sky and fly through the heavens
Open your eyes and soar above the blue
Take a breath and believe you can do anything
Time to spread your wings and take to the sky
Set on a course for adventure
Somewhere beyond the blue moon
Go and discover the treasure
Where you land is up to you

Take to the sky and fly through the heavens
Open your eyes and soar above the blue
Take a breath and believe you can do anything
Time to spread your wings and take to the sky

Find yourself wrapped up in rainbow
Dancing with fireflies
Might just be paradise

Take to the sky and fly through the heavens
Open your eyes and soar above the blue
Take a breath and believe you can do anything
Time to spread your wings and take to the sky

Open your eyes and soar above the blue
Take a breath and believe you can do anything
Time to spread your wings and take to the skyYou might also likeEmbed
