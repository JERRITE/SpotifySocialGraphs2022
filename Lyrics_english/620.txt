Now says Lyrics [letter from "now says" ft. Archangel]

[Enter: Archangel & J Balvin]
Baby, Chris Jeday, Chris Jeday
Austin Baby (J Balvin, Man)
Ozuna, Baby (Ozuna; Au!)
You don't want to know about me
Tell me what I did wrong
They put you against me
Who was not vo 'to forgive
[Choir: Ozuna & J Balvin]
Now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other
Now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other

[Verse 1: ozuna]
I know you spend denying
To 'what you and I did
It remains in your recorded mind
Every time we undress
Now I walked out
How you can live like this
Saying no
Knowing that, between sheets, you entered me '
Only I could reach him
Your body knows how to rise
And when your legs were trembling
You didn't say anything, no longer
And now that I walk with money
I don't want interruptions
From priority
You went to the options list
I am with the Colombian who leaves tomorrow
And the Cuban arrives in Paris
Call the Russian to lower the kilos of gold
That arrives in the afternoon to Brazil
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro: J Balvin]
Only I could reach him
Your body knows how to rise
And when your legs were trembling
You didn't say anything, nothing, no, no

[Choir: Ozuna & Archangel]
Now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other
And now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember when we did
When in bed we killed each other

[Verse 2: J Balvin]
(Haha, J Balvin, Man)
Po-po-by more that you deny me, you can't escape
If I was your light, you, my shadow and you followed me everywhere
They managed to separate (EY), you didn't want to listen (EY)
It was more important what people said where we could get (Rra!)
In the world of me they are talking, saying a thousand things
That they see me here, that they see me there, for my famous life
You know me years ago, you know what the thing is like (the thing)
You know that I am real, I told you once
I thought our love is yesterday
That you do not want to read it, that even the street you want to see me
If you leave party, you listen to me
They always ask you for me, Baby
Tell me what it feels like to be the ghost that torments you?
[Verse 3: Archangel]
Tell what happened, mommy, everything was normal
They talked about me, you let yourself take
Your body was starting to love
And because of the people now it's time to forget
I know you're unhappy but you spend lying
Pretending you're happy, mommy, I don't understand you
Now he starts crying, he also puts you to suffer
While I started traveling, very pretty made you look

[Pre-car: Archangel]
Only I could reach him
Your body knows how to rise
And when your legs were trembling
They didn't tell me anything, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Choir: Ozuna, Archangel & J Balvin]
Now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other
Now he says he doesn't know me, no, no, no, no, no
And if he has seen me it is supposed to be in the past
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other

[Outro: J Balvin, Ozuna & Arc√°ngel]
