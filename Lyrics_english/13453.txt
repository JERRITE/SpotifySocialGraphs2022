My Lyrics Declaration ["My Declaration" FT letter. Timbaland & Sid]

[Intro: Maluma]
Get your voice, who do you think? Don't talk like that (Aj√°)
Today that we are facing me I have to admit (listen)
Yes, I was with another in other arms, but I swear that always thinking about you, mmm (aha)
And yes, I do not deny that another lover saw in me what you never saw in me
And I have to tell you (listen)
I was waiting for you to change
But your train was already gone, empty and with nothing
Without a single passenger who understands you
Not even one that his hand extends
I was waiting for one day
Your smile will combine with mine
But my nights were still cold
Like the ice you put in our lives (Baby)
[Chorus: Maluma]
What you say, because I did
Because you didn't give me what I wanted
Do not come with complaints, or with rare stories
You are the culprit of this disappointment
What you say, because I did
Because you didn't give me what I wanted
I know, the time came, and I tell you clearly
I'm already tired, I'm leaving another side

[Post-car: Maluma]
Let me
I know, love time
Now I give you my goodbye (Alright)
I already have a replacement, that is much better
Let me
I know, love time (Yeah)
Now I give you my goodbye
I already have another replacement, I wear another pants (he says)

[Verse 1: Maluma]
I already have another title for this chapter
It is called "Adam and Eva, together in the same circle where the apple was the culprit"
It was with great chest 'and enviable
How to say no, if temptation arrived?
The house was dark and on the street dawned
The wishes won me (ey), I could more than the heart
And that motivated me for my statement
