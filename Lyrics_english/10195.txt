Seventeen Going Under (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Fender, Holly Humberstone, Both]
I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist fights on the beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Crying like a child
And the boy who kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down
[Verse 2: Sam Fender, Holly Humberstone, Both]
I was far too scarеd to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with angеr, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

[Chorus: Holly Humberstone with Sam Fender]
You hurt them like they're nothin' (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You hurt them like they're nothin' (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You hurt them like they're nothin' (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 3: Sam Fender]
See, I spent my teens enraged, spirallin' in silence
And I armed myself with a grin
'Cause I was always the fuckin' joker
Buried in their humour amongst the white noise and boys' boys
Locker room talkin' lads' lads
Drenched in cheap drink and snide fags
A mirrored picture of my old man
Oh God, the kid's a dab hand
Canny chanter, but he looks sad

[Chorus: Sam Fender, Holly Humberstone, Both]
God, the kid looks so sad (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh God, the kid looks so sad (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

She said the debt, the debt, the debt
So I thought about shifting gear
And how she wept and wept and wept
Luck came and died 'round here
I see my mother, the DWP see a number
She cries on the floor encumbered

[Chorus: Sam Fender & Holly Humberstone]
I'm seventeen goin' under
I'm seventeen goin' under (Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Outro: Sam Fender & Holly Humberstone]
Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohEmbed
