Nothing Special Lyrics[Verse 1: Varrick Jay]
At that point near the end of the album
When you don’t pay as much attention as before
We wrote this song in less than an hour
Doing what we can to give you guys some more

[Pre-Chorus: Varrick Jay]
Go ahead and call us unprepared
But we had to fill the space, and guess what?

[Chorus: Varrick Jay]
Here’s a song for you!
A filler song for you! Whoa-oh-oh!
We weren’t even trying, and as a result
We have a filler song for you!
[Verse 2: Varrick Jay]
Why’d you have such high expectations?
With this many songs, it’s bound to happen
You may think that we’re wasting your time
That’s probably because we are wasting your time

[Pre-Chorus: Varrick Jay]
I know that we just rhymed "time" with "time," though there’s
Other rhymes for "time," like "dime", and "chyme," I guess?

[Chorus: Varrick Jay]
And here’s a song for you!
A filler song for you! Whoa-oh-oh!
We weren’t even trying, and as a result
We have a filler song for you!

[Verse 3: Patty Walters]
Here’s guest vocals from Patty Walters
I’m really having second thoughts about this part
Why the hell would anybody like this?
It blows my mind that you can pass this off as art

[Pre-Chorus: Patty Walters]
Sunrise Skater Kids is getting old
You could use some better jokes, you sellout
You might also like[Chorus: Varrick Jay, Patty Walters]
Patty Walters is a chode! Seriously? Really mature, guys...
A big, fat, ugly chode! Hey! Whoa-oh-oh! Asshole...
He sounds like he’s thirteen! Okay, that was completely
Uncalled for! Patty Walters is a chode!

[Bridge: Varrick Jay]
You’ve made it to a creative bridge...
I really don't know what to do at this point...

[Chorus: Varrick Jay]
Let’s go back to the chorus!
A filler song for you! Whoa-oh-oh!
We weren’t even trying, and as a result
We have a filler song for you!

[Post-Chorus: Varrick Jay, Patty Walters]
A filler song for you!
This is a shameless, vapid excuse for a song!

[Chorus: Varrick Jay, Patty Walters]
It's not over yet, here’s a song for you!
(Damn it! You are literally just using me)
A filler song for you! Whoa-oh-oh!
(You are not like us real musicians, Jarrod!)
We weren’t even trying, (obviously,) and as a result
Patty Walters is a chode!
(This isn’t even you singing, I am so confused!)
[Outro: Varrick Jay, Patty Walters]
A big, fat, ugly chode! (I hate you so much!) Whoa-oh-oh!
We met the bare minimum time requirement of
What constitutes a full song...
(My name better not be on this...)Embed
