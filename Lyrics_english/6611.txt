Lost Chapter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boundless shadows, land of the hundred czars
Hallowed warriors, rest beneath the stars

[Refrain]
No more we ever speak
Of fields of reckoning
No voice calling, from the dark
Names of gold
Forged in wars of old
[Pre-Chorus]
The memory remains
A vision of endless misery
Woes of ours in vein...

[Chorus]
Sons of Minerva, the fortune of the realm
Call on our savior, to wipe out all the traitors
The Earth trembles as we gather ashore
For the lands we swore to hold
For our kingdom glorious

[Verse 2]
Endless demons, found us overnight
Still we're standing, basking in the light

[Refrain]
No more we ever speak
Of fields of reckoning
No voice calling, from the dark
Days of old
Wars victorious

[Pre-Chorus]
The memory remains
Worlds falling a-way
You might also like[Chorus]
Sons of Minerva, the fortune of the realm
Call on our savior, to wipe out all the traitors
The Earth trembled as we gathered ashore
For the lands we swore to hold
For our kingdom glorious

[Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
Sons of Minerva, the fortune of the realm
Call on our savior, to wipe out the traitors
The Earth trembles as we gather ashore
For the lands we swear to hold
For our kingdom glorious3Embed
