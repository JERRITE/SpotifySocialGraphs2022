Burning temptation (live) Lyricsotra once you crossed in my life
Why without letting me know
Just when I started again
Porfin to forget you
Your gaze brought me the verses
What did I want
Waking the desire stronger
That in me he fell asleep
You don't know I'm no longer alone
Another want was filling the void
Now is not the same story
I refused to fool him with you
I don't want to look at you
Because love for you still escapes me
I can not deny it
My lips bite to feel again
I don't want to look at you
Well, you provoke me without intention
I can not deny it
You are still my burning temptation
It is so easy to tell my life that I look elsewhere
The difficult thing is that I walk why do not look for the past
You get Why I see in your eyes that good lover
But I'm still thinking about the other that if you know how to love me
You don't know I'm no longer alone
Another want was filling the void
Now is not the same story
I refused to fool him with you
I don't want to look at you
Because love for you still escapes me
I can not deny it
My lips bite to feel again
I don't want to look at you
Well, you provoke me without intention
I can not deny it
You are still my burning temptation
I can not deny it
You are still my burning temptacionyou miGht Also Likeembed
