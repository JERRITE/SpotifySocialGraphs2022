Inner Demons Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say don't let them in
Close your eyes and clear your thoughts again
But when I'm all alone, they show up on their own
Cause inner demons fight their battles with fire
Inner demons don't play by the rules
They say "Just push them down, just fight them harder
Why would you give up on it so soon?"

[Chorus]
So angels, angels please just keep on fighting
Angels don't give up on me today
Cause' the demons they are there; they just keep biting
Cause inner demons just won't go away
So angels please, hear my prayer
Life is pain, lifes not fair
So angels please; please stay here
Take the pain; take the fear
[Verse 2]
They say it won't be hard; but they can't see the battles in my heart
But when I turn away
The demons seem to stay
Cause inner demons don't play well with angels
They cheat and lie and steal and break and bruise
Angels please protect me from these rebels
This is a battle I don't want to lose

[Chorus]
So angels, angels please just keep on fighting
Angels don't give up on me today
Cause the demons they are there; they just keep biting
Cause inner demons just won't go away

So angels, angels please just keep on fighting
Angels don't give up on me today
Cause the demons; they are there
They just keep biting
Inner demons just won't go away

So angels please, hear my prayer
Life is pain; life's not fair
So angels please; please stay here
Take the pain; take the fearYou might also like11Embed
