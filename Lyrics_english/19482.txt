You Could Break My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1: Lauren Weintraub]
Yeah, I know I say I hate you, but I can't get enough
Don't you know that girls only say it to the guys that they love
'Cause we fight, then we fuck, then we make back up
Nah it ain't perfect but it's just us
It's just us, it is the only us I want

[Chorus: Lauren Weintraub]
'Cause the way you're looking at me tonight
It makes me get that feeling that we gon' be alright
'Cause I'm way better with you by my side
So, you could break my heart for the rest of my life
You could break my heart for the rest of my life
[Verse 2: Huey Mack]
Had some issues in the past babe
But I know they wouldn't last babe
At the end of the day through all our mistakes
I wanna give you my last name
I ain't never met someone like you
That made me feel all the things you do
I used to spend my nights on the town
Just running around but now I wanna spend 'em with you

[Chorus: Lauren Weintraub & Huey Mack]
'Cause the way you're looking at me tonight
It makes me get that feeling that we gon' be alright
'Cause I'm way better with you by my side
So, you could break my heart for the rest of my life
Yeah, you could break my heart for the rest of my life

[Bridge: Huey Mack, Lauren Weintraub, both]
'Cause we fight, then we fuck, then we make back up
Nah, it ain't perfect but it's just us
It's just us and it's the only us I want
Don't wanna sleep, wanna keep all our neighbors up
All our friends say that we're too much
It's just us and it's the only us I want

[Chorus: Lauren Weintraub & Huey Mack]
'Cause the way you're looking at me tonight
It makes me get that feeling that we gon' be alright
'Cause I'm way better with you by my side
So, you could break my heart for the rest of my life
Oh, baby yeah you could break my heart for the rest of my life
You could break my heart for the rest of my lifeYou might also likeEmbed
