Let It Reign Lyrics[Intro: KB]
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven, sing out
Let it—
Come, Yahweh, reign over all, yeah, it's all Yahweh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: KB]
Never finna change, take it to the grave, I be honest (Yeah, yeah)
We see the dead raised here, another day at the office (Ayy, ayy)
Holy, holy, I'ma burn for the Father
Gathered 'round the fire, it's Benihana
Free, free, we the sons and the daughters
Remember Him then my name is forgotten
Yeah, He in control, yeah
And He got the soul, yeah, got the shows, yeah
Bow down, take a knee, that's what I propose, yeah
Homie, where your manners? (No cap)
Every nation's anthem will have to kneel to Hosanna, uh-huh
Lord now, been Lord then
Never waited for endorsement
Never cared about a Forbes list when you got God as your portion
Turn a cold heart into Mozart
All the world's stars that get WorldStarred
Your boy watched like Ozark, talkin' Jason Bateman
You wanna be like Jesus, might have to flip some tables (Yeah)
Who is greater? I'll wait (Yeah)
You want to make my day (Yeah)
I know Christ got the keys (Yeah) like He doin' valet (Yeah)
Who my God can't save? (Oh)
That's a finger roll, ayy (Oh, God)
[Pre-Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven (Come on!)
Let it rain

[Chorus: KB]
My God, my God, it's all on You
Your throne won't end, Your crown won't move
Come, Yahweh, reign over all, yeah
Nations will fall, Lord, let it reign
My God, my God, it's all on You
The demons tremble, darkness moves
Come, Yahweh, reign over all, yeah
Arm to the throne, Lord, let it reign

[Post-Chorus: KB]
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven, come on
Let it— (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: KB]
Let it go now, rain on us all, hit the street
Let it go, yeah, bring on the falls and the feast
Let 'em show out, God is on our mind, enemies
To our hinds, I have been lyin' and I'm lyin', I'm at Your feet
Let 'em be, yeah, we gon' ruin this peace
Yeah, your knees weak when He speaks
It's that SWV
Yeah, and I rest up with my Gs
They came messed up what I seen
Ain't the less up in here, blessed up in here, reps up a High King (Oh, God)

Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven (Come on!)

[Chorus: KB & Bizzle]
My God, my God, it's all on You
Your throne won't end, Your crown won't move
Come Yahweh, reign over all, yeah
Nations will fall, Lord, let it reign
My God, my God, it's all on You
The demons tremble, darkness moves
Come, Yahweh, reign over all, yeah
Arm to the throne, Lord, let it reign (Bizzle)

[Verse 3: Bizzle & KB]
All glory to the Most High
Only one of those, no tie
No lie, no bowtie for mine
Get to buckin' like a four-five
He the first and the last
Knew the ending from the beginning in your time
He the light and the sun
When He comes, sunlight'll get no shine
So high with a low bride (Come, Yahweh)
Made low showing no pride (Reign over all)
Took a late stroll on the low tide
For the lay-folk on a boat ride
Came so that we won't die
Gave hope to the same folk that were hatin' on 'em, he a dope guy
Most try but it don't fly
He the Lamb and the G.O.A.T. 
True and living God with a capital "G" on Him
Me and KB lean on it
Point blank period, with a "T" on it
(Come rain on us)
[Outro]
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven (Come on!)
