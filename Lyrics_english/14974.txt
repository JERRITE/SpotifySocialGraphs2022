The Way You Used to Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I first met her she was seventeen
Seventeen
Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
Burned alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We run 'til no one could find us
Girl, we outrun everyone

[Chorus]
But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
They'll terrorize

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

[Chorus]
But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

[Bridge]
Now
The way you used to do

[Verse 3]
My heart, a ding-a-ling
A puppet on a string
C'est la vie
So lay your hands across my beating heart, love

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

[Chorus]
But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

[Outro]
Used to do
Like the way you used to do
Come and love me now
Like the way you used to do
Like the way you used to do9Embed
