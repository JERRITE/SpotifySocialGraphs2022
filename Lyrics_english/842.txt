Fly Lyrics ["fly" text]

[Intro]
Baby, baby
Baby I know how to fly
Sick Luke, Sick Luke
Izeh, izeh

[Refrain]
Baby, I know how to fly
One day come with me
I know how to cure
You come with me one day
With me, with me, with me
With me, with me, and with me
And with me, and with me, with me
With me, with me
You come with me one day
[Verse 1]
Travel levying like a fakir
You are discrediting the friend friend
I unleash my dependence on the Gadro
Fra ',' sti parcels around fan the thief cop
I smoke smoke the essence
Clouds, clouds and fog
Around I have the Brugos for those who need
I put in place and the state stops me
I do the same that I don't care
Lock place: Pieces of shit
Rather, throw it from the third to p-tong
Rather I throw myself that I run away in the grass
And these fans ugly but never like me
Everyone knows it, even your zozza
If I do the roundabouts on the piece
It is because I have to get my ear dirty
And you come with me that convenient you
That you will see one day with me you have fun
Like that fan at the beginning of a derby
You are disgusting with me: a press
Do you understand?

[Interlude]
Izeh, izeh

Baby I know how to fly
One day come with me
I know how to cure
You come with me one day
With me, with me, with me
With me, with me, with me
With me, with me, and with me
And with me, and with me
Come on a day with me

[Verse 2]
When you write me those things, you know it's not true
That I will take me a lot for, but you would like it behind
I'm done not to listen to you, so much so that you would like?
You don't listen to you and from opinions as if you knew
I who aim right precisely because you don't understand
That you confuse in two seconds
You want the rod and the Riesling
After you offend you to try to hit me
But do you get back? You should cover yourself!
Fra ', on the road I continue to hit
I'm with the bandana and I don't like it that I fuck the scarce
Aperitif with the anacardi
After I write them if he wants to get caught
He is out of the bar with his Bacardi
He is with friends, he doesn't want to do herself
Then he moves away to make himself
Above me, I equal a lioness
I leave the guilty for two hours, after the cliffs
This goes away with red ass: slap imprint
I make "one, two, three" but to two run
I do "VROOM VROOM VROOM" with the Booster Marcio
Fuck you well you don't see me anymore
I fucked you well, maybe too much, you don't get loyal to you anymore
I signed you the Levi's, after the leggings you don't get them anymore
Feel my perfume everywhere so you don't get up anymore
[Refrain]
Baby I know how to fly
One day come with me
I know how to cure
You come with me one day
With me, with me, with me
With me, with me, with me
With me, with me, and with me
And with me, and with me
Come on a day with me

[Outro]
All fucking days, yah
Wild Bandana
Yeeh, Eeh8embed
