Culture / High Lyrics[Verse 1: Sonny Shotz]

Billie Jean, walking around the city
With a pair of red bottoms and piercing on her tittie
She was barely 22, he was almost 18
It was windy in the CHI so they moved to New Orleans
Hip-Hop in the bedroom, Rock in the kitchen
It was R&B dinners for the soul they were missing
You can probably hear em lovin on the floor by the oven
Purple rain for the soundtrack skips when she's coming
Words for the moment, smoking herbs til we stonin'
She don't know the basic functions of an iPhone
Colors from the 80's with music from the 90's
And a couple free spirits wearing nylon
The culture of the last the future of the past
The present day shakespeare quotes you should grasp
[Hook: Sonny Shotz, Dani Ummel]

Thats why I make em all clap
Thats why I make em all clap like
Culture, this one's for the culture
This one's for the culture
Culture, this one's for the culture
Culture, this one's for the culture

[Verse 2: Sonny Shotz]

Broken hearts, first dates and the people we admire
With some drugs a few drinks and the people we desire
Listen close, speak true, keep your soul, keep your soul
Keep your love in the pocket of a woman that you know
What a day for the dreamer, what a month for the models
Here's a picture from the city, ain't she pretty poppin bottles
It's my number take it down, hit me up when you're in town
Got some moments we could drink and regrets I need to drown
21 livin' almost famous, fuck im young til its almost painless
Picasa Picasso with a snapback, im billie jean's baby and michael wouldn't have that
The kids of the genius the devil wants allegiance
We started with a goal and ended up with achievements
Mary on my necklace, praying to jehovah
A child who would die before they ever said "i told ya"

Culture, this one's for the culture
This one's for the culture
Culture, this one's for the culture
Culture, this one's for the culture
This one's for the culture

[Verse 3: Sonny Shotz]

Uh, yeah, uh huh, ok, it's the deans
San francisco in the bathroom
Then its vegas in the classroom
Professors getting worried because my visions getting blurry
I was trippin in the last room
Trying to focus on my weekend
Crazy bitches trying to draw me to the deep end
Swimmin in my memories, I see a vision of the person I was meant to be

[Hook: Sonny Shotz]

Drug, keep it real steady
Balance out the lows
Keep the dose real heavy
I dont need to be the highest
But if I could do you
I ain't saying you should try it
But in case you do, you do
These drugs, keep it real steady
Balance out the lows
Keep the dose real heavy
I dont need to be the highest
But if I could do you
I ain't saying you should try it
But in case you do, you do these drugs

[Verse 4: Sonny Shotz]
Keep it real steady, keep it real steady
Yeah Cancun in the living room
Paris in the kitchen
It was Boston on the roof
Until they told us what to do
But we dont care enough to listen
Thats the motto of the new kids
How dare a nigga try an tell me how to use it
Thats the season for the wrong things
But two wrongs dont make it right if you just do it

San Francisco in the bathroom
Then its Vegas in the classroom
Professors getting worried because my visions getting blurry
I was trippin' in the last room
Trying to focus on my weekend
Crazy bitches trying to draw me to the deep end
Swimmin' in my memories, I see a vision of the person I was meant to be

[Hook: Sonny Shotz]

Drug, keep it real steady
Balance out the lows
Keep the dose real heavy
I dont need to be the highest
But if I could do you
I ain't saying you should try it
But in case you do, you do

These drugs, keep it real steady
Balance out the lows
Keep the dose real heavy
I dont need to be the highest
But if I could do you
I ain't saying you should try it
But in case you do, you do these drugsEmbed
