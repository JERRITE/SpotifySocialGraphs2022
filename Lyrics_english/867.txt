Leave it Lyrics [letter of "Leave it" ft. Manuel Turizo]

[Intro: Manuel Turizo]
You are already accustomed
That this person never puts his part (his part)
To understand you and much less to give you
What you need (Yeah), you always solve
And he is happy there with his lovers

[Pre-Caro: Nacho, Manuel Turizo, both]
That's why I ask you to stay with me (uoh-oh)
I love you so much and God is witnessing (witness)
If I treat you well just being your friend
Imagine if I were with you (hahaha)
[Choir: Nacho, Manuel Turizo]
That is why leave it
Forget that fool and vamon '
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you
Leave it alone
That the time has come
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you

[Verse 1: Manuel Turizo, Nacho, both]
(Manuel Turizo)
Understand that I am different (hah)
Don't believe what people say (no, no)
We are not all equal
I want me to give me a while
That this man does not lie to you
And dare
Lady Come
You know I want your kisses, leave me
Receive, to make you feel
That our moment has arrived

[Choir: Nacho, Manuel Turizo]
Leave it alone
Forget that fool and vamon '
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you
Leave it alone
That the time has come
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you

Tell me how the wounds of the past
That this guy has caused you, they have not killed you
Tell me, baby, how have you overcome
What has done that degenerate?
A patán that has never loved you
I have offered everything
And I haven't given it because you didn't want to stay by my side
You have been able, but you have not achieved
Separate you from such a rare type

[Pre-Caro: Manuel Turizo, Nacho, both]
That's why I ask you to stay with me (you stay with me)
I love you so much and God is a witness (witness)
If I treat you well just being your friend
Imagine if I were with you

[Coro: Manuel Turizo, Nacho, both]
That's why Leave it (Leave it)
Forget that fool and vacono '(Vamono')
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you
Leave it alone
That the time has come
From now on ignore it
Don't waste time anymore, baby
That something better awaits you
