A92 x Fumez the Engineer - Plugged In Freestyle Lyrics[Intro: A9Ksav]
A92, Fumez the Engineer, Plugged In, gang
Yo, Charlie, I like this one
92, baby, it's K

[Verse 1: A9Ksav]
I’ll swing my arm in a figure of eight, or I won't leave till the whole clip empty
Them boy ain't nuttin' but paigons, I can see why them boy love envy
I want-I want-I want LV, Prada, or Gucci, I might just offend my opps in Fendi
And when juice get spilled like soda, no, I won't say no words like Kenny
[Verse 2: A9Dbo Fundz]
My hand ting comin' like Corona, if it coughs twice then it's turnin' you pack
They say that we come like athletes, circle your block and we do them laps
All out attack, tryna get this paigon, all out attack in the fields, don't lack
He thought hе was big like Mac till I pulled out this stick, tryna swing for backs

[Verse 3: A92 BT]
In the bando, no Kay, but I still makе K’s from this Lyca sim
The jake boys irritate my skin, can't put me in the bin, no comment, can't sing
Don't sing like 6, don't snitch like 9
Still circle the 9 two times
With a machine, no gym, tryna put him in the sky
Make an opp boy fly, get whacked by mine

[Verse 4: Offica]
Where them at? Where them dey? Where the paigons?
Make the boy's eyes look like an Asian
Man, we get round there on any occasion, it ain't a ride out, it's an invasion
And if you fuck with them, it's a simple equation, you're an opp boy, you're a paigon
A ti lo a ti dé, more time when we slide round there, it's a quick ting, no calculation

[Verse 5: A9Ksav]
By God’s grace, I don't end up a lifer, but I still slide, see me a real rider
I ying-yang like China, rip 2 G's, make them drip like designer
On the block, dressed in black like Chyna
Fresh Air ones, see me in my sliders
Hopefully, I ain't got to remind you, up the A and fuck the Niners
Yo, I can't stand them boy from the 9
All they know is tell lies, tell lies, but their main boy got splashed, baptised
And another 9 boy got hospitalised
Any talk on the A get bun, drills get done by me and the guys
Dbo tryna swing for backs, he can't swing for backs, so they stay inside
You might also like[Verse 6: A9Dbo Fundz]
Scar man’s face like Al Pacino
Buck-buck-buck into A and you can hold two on the paint, no free throw
Bow, bow, now, the gun need reload
Stuck in the trap with one eye open, hopin' the cats don't jugg that kilo
Dbo Fundz, you can’t miss me on road
Fundz 'cause man's got green like Cee-Lo
Bro-bro went and bust that gun, I don't think that he’ll bust that case
They say we don't slide to the B, but Foomey’s gaff got smashed, no trace
They left Rexy fightin' for his life, on a hospital bed, got chinged broad day
A1 give her dick in her belly, which side is she on? Ask your paigon bae

[Verse 7: A92 BT]
About slide to the B, we slide to the B
How many man got chased by we and lil' man Rose got got times 3?
All the Niners watched them flee, was me and MZ tryna catch them tree
Tryna switch it like OT Chi, but I'm in OT, tryna make this cheese
I lurked down the B Town strip
I was pissed that he didn't get hit
Tell bro, "Rise that mash and spit", aim for his top, or aim for his wig
I seen bro grab that stick, bally on his face, he's takin' that risk
Let sticks beat like drum kit, pull up on them and pump it
Tryna let it blow like trumpets at them muppets

[Verse 8: Offica]
Bro said to hold this stick, man, you need them muscles
He let it spray like Mr. Muscles
Chocolate ting from Belgium, Brussels
She wanna go low, man, bring them bottles
Wait, she wanna jiggle and wiggle
This bad B one split in the middle
Leng, bunda come fat, not little
All my girls them sweet like Skittles
Yo, baby, how you move like that?
This gyalie wanna arch her back
Go low, limbo, limbo, touch your toe, no Elvis, baby, when I rock and roll
Me and my guys, we flow like the river
Chat loose, get one in your liver, or maybe your intestine
I got love for my gang, don't test man
[Verse 9: A9Ksav]
I got washed up opps, it's peak 'cause you man move gay, that's suttin' like Marvin
Out in the town, tryna dish these foods
Ends are hot, but these cats be starvin'
We score them goals like FIFA, but we don't commentate like Martin
No Taylor when we got down Swift
Two more down, that's no more targets

[Verse 10: A9Dbo Fundz]
I do them in my Nike tracksuit and sliders, I do that there in my LV kicks
Must be the one who's spreadin' this virus 'cause everyone knows that my flow's too sick
OT flyin', we ridin'
Out on the field, tryna catch me a prick
Bando days, we spin 'round drivin'
Wave this wand in my hand, no wiz

[Verse 11: A92 BT]
Ayy, I've been in the T with profit, bruck down buds, tryna make that profit
They chat on the net and gossip, A92, we the hottest topic
Shout SS for the pocket rocket
D-B-O got the plug like socket
I been 'round there on a madness
Watch them dash, what happened to the badness?

[Verse 12: Offica]
In the block like "Awon da oya b’ota"
How many points have we scored in the last few weeks? Meji, merin, mefa
On the ball, twenty-two on my back like Kaká
Bro scores like Laca, shoot and they scatter
Watch them man japa
Boppity bop, boppity bop, gbe soke ju si le omo dancer

[Outro]
