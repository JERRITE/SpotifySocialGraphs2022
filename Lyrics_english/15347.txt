Four Letters, Two Words LyricsThis is a sequel
To a message that went unheard
He was unteachable
Can you believe it
Still special after all these years
Hard to believe it

It was a blessing in his eyes
She was undressing his disguise

Four letters and two words
Words that mean the same
Funny how funny how
One is love and one is your name
Four letters and two words
Words that mean the same
Funny how funny how
One is love and one is your name
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

She came along and raised his soul
And taught him how to live
And he was good to learn
She would degrade him on the curve
He wasn't all that she deserved
Not privacy reserved

It was a blessing in his eyes
She was undressing his disguise

Four letters and two words
Words that mean the same
Funny how funny how
One is love and one is your name
Four letters and two words
Words that mean the same
Funny how funny how
One is love and one is your name
One is your name
One is your name

And she was able
To move the imovable
Oh yeah
And she was able
To make the impossible
To make the impossible
Possible
