Adult Content Lyrics[Verse 1]
Young hero, man
Music making like zero, man
Walk 'round town with pants so fat
I look like Kim Kardashian
You know the way I speak is direct
I could leave you upset
Hang around with it, leave no doubt of it
Stab you deep in the neck
Eyes that hypnotise
Grab the wheel while I read the signs
Join my club if you're keen to fight
Yeah, don't wear gloves, I'mma need your mind
I'll be like rolling 'round with the best
I could leave you in debt
Straight up rocking it, leave you copping it
I don't sleep with the rest
[Hook]
What you know is what you see
I've been out here all day flexing by the trees
Let me tell you something, fried chicken is the key
And you know it's only bad bitches on the D
When you're rolling with my team
Rolling with my team
When you're rolling with my team
Rolling with my, when you're rolling with my
When you're rolling with my

[Verse 2]
Still thinking of you
10:45 gotta' be up soon
End of the Earth but the girl comes first
Straight girl like a pearl got to see what it do, like blessed
Eat steak all day
Needs like Arianna Grande
Swimming in pools made of Bombay
And not a bitch when I brawl like Solange

[Interlude]
I'll be blessed, yeah
I'll be blessed, yeah
I'll be blessed, yeah
I'll be blessed, blessed

Cash tucked in my waistband
Never kill my own like an ape, man
Few years later I'm a changed man
I keep telling myself I'm a sane man
I'll be blessed
You were gonna' call me
Straight dope my balls reppin' Tommy
Straight holes in my roof like I'm Donnie
Camouflaged wardrobe man from the army
I'll be what?
Sippin' on a cup (huh?)
Lifestyle diamond in a rough (huh?)
Shoot first man I'm a cop
And consuming the booze 'till I boom and I pop
Like I'll be what?
Ya'll keep testing me
People keep talk 'till they next to me
Haven't you heard? I'm the best to be
You got a team and they all wanna' be me
I'll be blessed

[Outro]
Still thinkin' of you, you
10:45 gotta' be up soon, soon
Yeah, with the girl comes first
Straight girl like a pearl gotta' see what it do like
Blessed
Still thinkin' of you, you
10:45 gotta' be up soon, soon
Yeah, with the girl comes first
Straight girl like a pearl gotta' see what it do like
