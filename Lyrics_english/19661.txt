Rollercoaster LyricsGot me riding on your rollercoaster
Up and down your loving take me and I won't let go
I was fine until you pulled me closer
Hit the ground and tried to save me, now I just don't know
Got me riding on your rollercoaster
Building up my hopes just to drop them low
I was fine until you pulled me closer
Hit the ground and tried to save me, now I just don't know

Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know, know, know, know
Got me riding on your rollercoaster
Up and down your loving take me and I won't let go
I was fine until you pulled me closer
Hit the ground and tried to save me, now I just don't know

Just don't know
Now I just don't know
Just don't know

On my way down from the incline, you dying to save me
But I promise it'd be best if I drown on my own
Insane, the ones who figured it out appear crazy
My baggage won't be bringing you down anymore
I don't say goodbye anymore, oh no
I don't need to try to be you at all
You're dying to save me, the end of my rope
Is approaching, I strayed from the bend of your road

Go, just go
When we're together is just when I'm lonely the most
Through all your highs and lows
Forever and never are seemingly close

Got me riding on your rollercoaster
Up and down your loving take me and I won't let go
I was fine until you pulled me closer
Hit the ground and tried to save me, now I just don't know
You might also likeJust don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't
Now I just don't know

Got me riding on your rollercoaster
Up and down your loving take me and I won't let go
I was fine until you pulled me closer
Hit the ground and tried to save me, now I just don't know

Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't know
Now I just don't knowEmbed
