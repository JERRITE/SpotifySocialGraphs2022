Songs For The Weekend LyricsNobody’s eyes are bluer than yours
I pack a cooler and put in ths
Put too many down turn my phone upside down
And let this life arrive in style

It’s about late nights, slowing down and fog rolling in
Take a moment, pause, for the light growing thin
Politics and physics don’t mix with my head
Forgive me, but sometimes I can forget that

We just write songs for the weekend
Knowing no one necessarily needs them
We drive a little farther cuz it’s scenic
Life is too short to lose the feeling
We just write songs for the weekend
Excеpt for when it’s snowing then we’rе skiing
Life’s a little better with some seasoning
We just write songs for the weekend

I wrote this song then forgot all the chords
I think it’s funny you can’t rhyme with orange…wait
Put too many down turn my phone upside down
And let this life arrive in style

It’s about late nights, slowing down and fog rolling in
Take a moment, pause, for the light growing thin
Politics and physics don’t mix with my head
Forgive me, but sometimes I can forget that

We just write songs for the weekend
Knowing no one necessarily needs them
We drive a little farther cuz it’s scenic
Life is too short to lose the feeling

We just write songs for the weekend
Except for when it’s snowing then we’re skiing
Life’s a little better with some seasoning
We just write songs for the weekend

Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
We just write songs
For the weekend

We just write songs for the weekend
Knowing no one necessarily needs them
We drive a little farther cuz it’s scenic
Life is too short to lose the feeling

We just write songs for the weekend
Except for when it’s snowing then we’re skiing
Life’s a little better with some seasoning
