Lyrics introspection [intro]
Yeah, n.o.s, yeah
Wesh, there's no cinema
HM, there's no cinema go to tchinez me
Tchine me, I didn't say hunt me

[Unique verse]
There's no cinema, go to me
Tchine me, I didn't say hunt me
From a very young age in detail because we balec des Ass-Dec
Big I understood that those who are engraving are those who do not let go of steak
There are those who cut kils, there are those who cut pipes
You take me a thorn of the foot, he is a bunch of thorns me
How to tell my fistons
That they like big thuns and louis vuitton
May God preserve good people, others do your reuss
You're cool but nobody takes me by boat my treasure
The money burns our fingers, the flames of hell will burn the rest
I run enough to drug the city before the end of Arres'
Igo I prayed the sky, like you I heard nothing
I was young and in dog it was a big kilo that I was held
You don't know my blaze, ask your bitch
It is by selling this shit that we ended in the bédave
She likes cash and sex, a ball against a greenback
People are lost, like an immigrant FN
Need anyone even fewer guys walking in heels
Here it is not by stretching your arm to people that you will have a long arm
A girl is like an ien-cli, it goes from hall to hall
A keuf is like an ien-cli, he can send you in jail
I will not baise justice without the presence of my friend
I put a lot of potatoes, I never put a rotten cable
We smoke the same strike, it's not the same addiction
There's nothing free because even after life we pay the bill
We eat haram, it cuts where the daronne cooks
There are those who go to the table, and yeah the scales cook
Everyone believes to be the boss, each on their own scale
There are those who play ladies, those who play chess
I do not listen to the stories of a guy who holds his book upside down
And if I am on Paname, I revise in hell
In Hebs there are many primaries, the judge is eaten from the CP
We will stop depressing, after having died
You left your girl for another who left his guy for Ile
A biting dog will start again, he will renounce the oigt-d you
I don't forget to kiss my loved ones, as long as God allows me
I don't forget to open my mouth before I finished locked up
People bored me so necessarily I get attached more
No more fighting it is on it, people no longer hide
I can't guide you myself I'm not in the right direction
Walk alone as a president without protection
The jealous tighten the belt, soon I send my gucci
Solo as in the future, just me and my candle
We break our heads all alone, we sell hash all alone
And we are above the laws, the penal code in the basement
At 15 rods I gave the judge, I did not know lol
Do not confuse giving her ass and giving his word wesh
That Pasa Lady, a ghetto youth has flowered
In the ghetto youth you flowed, n.o.s in the me-ri
I do not agree with the woman, and I let the man let's let go even less
It turns back to her re-cui like a salt salam shalom
A guy who doesn't know how to ride, he can't drive alone
You want us to cause, go to Corbeil 91 Essonne
I have to smoke the last oin-j, on the last kilo
More graduated than the commissioner, rap text in philosophy
Go see me if you're faithful you will have a chrome
Asking we got away, does not try to give me in a coma
I see the street like a jungle, igo I run the green
When you have it in your pockets, you embark on your business
Thousand euros for the MIF, asks at Tarik
Big I feel different, like a device
There I admit I am a kid, the two fingers in the handbag
I was not stretched out, because I'm too far away
Bronchitis, knotted throat
All our dreams have sank, send them a buoy
We crush our feelings as we crush the cockroaches
We shoot our enemies as we pull on a job eh
Igo with a close -up you can follow the right path
Covered with dressings, I say true and you lie
On the earth on earth you can not tell me go jump
I was saying it's not for me I got it like others
If the keufs knew what we know, in my street smashed
Outside we bleed, damn dark look
It's for my suffering my delinquency you don't get your stupid you are stupid
You can do canner by opening it does not inflate the pecs
Lights the wick of a judge for the brothers who are burned
I passed a street on the street so my shit bullated
We don't know the debts
And if we get click clack we don't know the heads
It's worth thousands of views, I’m hitting your comments
I dash the MIF, before I was buried Might Also Like9embed
