Iâ€™m Not OK Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sick to my stomach
Four in the morning, I can't sleep
In and out the city
I'm worried 'bout where you may be
Feels like I've been here
Stressing the things that I can see
Where do you go? What do you do?
Without me, without me

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Losing my faith, I'm losing my faith
Slipping away, you're slipping away
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay
[Verse 2]
Feel a little guilty, uh
I feel like it's written all over me
Tryna find a balance, trusting you, trusting me
Feel a little heavy
Holdin' onto something that I don't need
I've been going through it, yeah
I've been going through it

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Losing my faith, I'm losing my faith
Slipping away, you're slipping away
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay

[Bridge]
All I want (All I want)
Take me home
Hold me close (Yeah)
Please don't let me go
I don't know, I don't know
Can you call from wherever you are?
Swear I feel (Yeah)
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Makes me cry
She run so far, here we are, here we are

I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Losing my faith, I'm losing my faith
Slipping away, you're slipping away
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay4Embed
