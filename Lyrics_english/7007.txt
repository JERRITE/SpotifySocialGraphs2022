I Wish I Missed My Ex Lyrics[Intro]
Every time the weekend comes, yeah
I know that it won’t be long, yeah
'Til you‘re gonna call my phone, yeah
You’ll be like "Babe, come over"
I know how this goes, yeah
Talk about you need closure
Too many missed calls, too many texts
Damn I wish I missed my ex
Every time the weekend comes, yeah
I know that it won’t be long, yeah
'Til you‘re gonna call my phone, yeah
You’ll be like "Babe, come over"

Talk about you need closure
Too many missed calls, too many texts
Damn, I wish I missed my ex

Texting, texting, texting
Troubling me all over my phone all night
This ain’t life, you’re troubling me
You're wishing you were still mine
I’m the only one you wanted
But I can’t follow where your heart is
Calling 'til the morning, na-na-na-na
Texting, texting, texting
Troubling me all over my phone all night
This ain’t love, you’re troubling me
You're wishing you were still mine
I’m the only one you wanted
But I can’t follow where your heart is
Calling 'til the morning, na-na-na-na
[Chorus]
Every time the weekend comes, yeah
I know that it won’t be long, yeah
'Til you're gonna call my phone, yeah
You’ll be like "Babe, come over" (Na-na-na-na)
I know how this goes, yeah
Talk about you need closure
Too many missed calls, too many texts
Damn, I wish I missed my ex12Embed
