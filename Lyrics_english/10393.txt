I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go
Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothin' more than broke
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'causе they're all I know
I always let thе good ones go
[Chorus]
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones

[Verse 2]
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
