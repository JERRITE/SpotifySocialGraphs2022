Take Me Home Lyrics[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
I'm falling to pieces
But I need this, yeah, I need this
You're my fault, my weakness
When did you turn so cold?
You cut me down to the bone
Now you're dancing all over my soul
I'm falling to pieces
To pieces, to pieces

[Pre-Drop: Bebe Rexha]
But I still stay
'Cause you're the only thing I know
So won't you take, oh
Won't you take me home?
Take me home, home, home
Take me home, home, home
Take me
[Drop: Bebe Rexha]
Take me, take me, take me
Take me home

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
Round in circles, here we go
With the highest highs and the lowest lows
But no one shakes me like you do
My best mistake was you
And you're my sweet affliction
'Cause you hurt me right, but you do it nice
Round in circles, here we go
Yeah

[Pre-Drop: Bebe Rexha]
But I still stay
'Cause you're the only thing I know
So won't you take, oh
Won't you take me home?
Take me home, home, home
Take me home, home, home
Take me

[Drop: Bebe Rexha]
Take me, take me, take me
Take me home, home, home
Take me home, home, home
Take me home
Take me

I still stay, oh
Won't you take me home?
