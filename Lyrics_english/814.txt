Stronger lyrics [louder letter "]

[Intro]
(You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger)
Now that I discovered that I can be happy without you
You have realized that missing me will not serve you
I leave you alone (I leave you alone)
I am long to walk
And no way (and no way)
When you see me again it will cost you
[Pre-car]
And I already understood, I'm not for you
Nor do you worry anymore, I'm not going to suffer
I never regretted, with you I learned it
Only one thing is left to tell you, that

[Chorus]
It hurts, but I needed to meet you
I learned enough
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger
It hurts, but you needed to meet me
Even if it is hard for you to believe
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger

[Post-car]
OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH, OH
I needed to meet you
OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH, OH
(You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger)

[Verse]
Everything was perfect and at that moment (I thought that, I met you)
Would you expect that I would be a lifetime
Why did you hurt me?
You do not have dates in my calendar
Who told you to miss you?
Would you expect that I would be a lifetime

And I already understood, I'm not for you
Nor do you worry anymore, I'm not going to suffer
I never regretted, with you I learned it
Only one thing is left to tell you, that

[Chorus]
It hurts, but I needed to meet you
I learned enough
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger
It hurts, but you needed to meet me (what?)
Even if it is hard for you to believe
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger

[Bridge]
You were the only one, so it sounds illogical
With whom I wanted more than physical
Something more romantic, but two were needed

[Pre-car]
And I already understood, I'm not for you
Nor do you worry anymore, I'm not going to suffer
I never regretted, with you I learned it
Only one thing is left to tell you, that

[Chorus]
It hurts, but I needed to meet you (meet you)
I learned enough (enough)
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger
It hurts, but you needed to meet me (what?)
Even if it is hard for you to believe
You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger
[Post-car]
OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH, OH
(Gre-Gre-Greeicy)
OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH, OH
(You didn't kill me and if you made me stronger)

[Outro]
Now that I discovered that I can be happy without you
You have realized that missing me will not serve you1embed
