Like I Roll LyricsI got my daddy’s car
And his old guitar
A suitcase full of broken hearts
Got my momma’s smile
And her baby blue eyes
I ain’t got much
But what I got is mine
And I roll like I roll
I roll like I roll

I got an open road
And a restless soul
The Rolling Stones on the radio
And I roll like I roll
Cause’ I roll like I roll
I roll like the hills under the California sun
Burn through the desert like the devil on the run
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day
I will roll like I roll

Well there’s a lot a people gonna try to bring you down
They got a lot of rules
They gonna try to put you out
I keep looking up
In this world full of doubt
I roll like I roll

I roll like the hills under the California sun
Burn through the desert like a devil on the run
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day

I’m not gonna let it slip away
Cause I’d rather burn in hell
Than to let it fade

I got an open road
And a restless soul
The Rolling Stones on the radio
And I roll like I roll
You might also likeI roll through the hills by my own Kentucky home
Back to the place where my heart belongs
I’ll be flying high till the day that I die
No matter what they say
I begin another day
I did it my wayEmbed
