Uh, uh
Uh (Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it (Even know it), even know it (Know it)
'Til they call you to the stage (Stage)
Then you seen a nigga throw it (Nigga throw it), th-throw it (Throw it)
Throwin' that ass for days
Booty goin' up, down
I ain't got no problem spendin' all of my money
Tryna see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin', uh
[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Black card (Card), party in the back yard (Back yard)
Shorty got the black bra showin' (Black bra showin')
Tatted up (Up), ass fat enough ('Nough)
She a bad bitch, and she already know it (Yeah, she know it)
Yeah, she know it, yeah, yeah, she know it (Yeah, she know it)

She gon' make me spend some money on it (Yeah, she know it)

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Whole bank account, I blow it (I blow it)
Go do a show then (Do a show then)
Bring some mo' in (Bring some mo' in)
Pockets bigger than a Samoan (Than a Samoan)
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, sho-, shorty go in
Booty hit the floor in (Hit the floor in)
Slow motion (Slow motion)
I'm so gone off Patr贸n ('Tr贸n)
I don't know how I'm gettin' home later on like

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it (Even know it), even know it (Know it)

Then you seen a nigga throw it (Nigga throw it), th-throw it (Throw it)
Throwin' that ass for days
Booty goin' up, down
I ain't got no problem spendin' all of my money

Shorty thick (Thick), thicker than a snicker (Snicker)
Every time she do it, it's for me and my niggas (It's for me and my niggas)
And her friend do it with her
She don't even like girls, but a stack'll make her kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
Go on, kiss her, go on, go on, kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
She don't even like girls, but a stack'll make her kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
Go on, kiss her, go on, go on, kiss her (Go on, kiss her)
She keep fuckin' around, I'll launch this missile (Go on, kiss her)

She make it drop, then jiggle (Then jiggle)
Put on a show then (On a show then)
Bring that dough in (Bring that dough in)
Booty bigger than a Samoan (Than a Samoan)
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, sho-, shorty go in
Booty hit the floor in (Hit the floor in)

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
And you know it (Know it), look at how she throw it (Throw it)
If it get any bigger, baby girl gon' have to tow it (Bow)
Tow it, sittin' on them M's like Floyd (Money)
But she lied to you (Yeah) if she said I paid for it (Nah)
Nigga, ninety-nine broads, ni-ninety-nine broads (What?)
Panoramic view from the 99th floor (What?)
I'm like "My Lord" when she down on all fours (What?)
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared to take a charge
Flyin' by in a car, you don't know what you saw (Wow)
She adjustin' her bra as I'm lightin' up a cigar (Damn)
They was writin' me off, now I arrive like a star (And)
I just sit back and laugh at the irony of it all
There them bands go, there them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like "Damn, boy, why you cuffin' that whore?" (What?)
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know it, goddamn

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I ain't even know it (Even know it), even know it (Know it)
'Til they call you to the stage (Stage)
Then you seen a nigga throw it (Nigga throw it), th-throw it (Throw it)
Throwin' that ass for days
Booty goin' up, down
I ain't got no problem spendin' all of my money
Tryna see what's up now

I ain't even know it (Even know it), even know it (Know it)
'Til they call you to the stage (Stage)
Then you seen a nigga throw it (Nigga throw it), th-throw it (Throw it)
Throwin' that ass for days
Booty goin' up, down
I ain't got no problem spendin' all of my money
Tryna see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nuttin', uh80Embed
