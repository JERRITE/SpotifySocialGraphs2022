Today I dare Lyrics ["I dare today"

[Pre-car: ñejo]
Today you do not go for any la'o
I believed that love no longer existed, that they had killed him
Here you have me in love
From a baby that I haven't even played or kiss
Today you do not go for any la'o
I believed that love no longer existed, that they had killed him
Here you have me in love
From a baby that I haven't even played or kiss
[Chorus: Dalmata]
And today I dare with her
Today it may be with me dare
Today I am not going without proof of her
It rains or does not rain, oeh
The stars aligned in my favor
Today I dare

[Verse 1: ñejo]
Today I dare, today I take it
Today I am going to do what I owe and what I should not
Today I am going to ride in a rocket for the moon
And if you want to see the stars I take you
Until you are not riding 'I don't take off
Until you are not riding 'I am not leaving
Today I left the playboy
Today you will know who I am
Because since I first saw you
With the tail of the eye to'a the clothes I took away
I put you how many I imagined
And without wanting to you I fell in love
A love of those at first glance
Of those beautiful girls who leave 'sinudes in magazines
Today you do not go for any la'o, 'so you don't see
Or rather, that you give up

And today I dare with her
Today it may be with me dare
Today I am not going without proof of her
It rains or does not rain, oeh
The stars aligned in my favor
Today I dare with her
Today it may be with me dare
Today I am not going without proof of her
It rains or does not rain, oeh
The stars aligned in my favor
Today I dare

[Verse 2: Dalmata]
Yesterday I told him "Goodbye", but he ignored me
Yesterday I said "Hello" and she didn't look
But something tells me that today I was given
Today I end up winning even if it's a hug
And hoping that this day will arrive
And today my day has arrived
Here I continue, I'm still
Hoping to see if it won even a hug

[Pre-car: ñejo]
Today you do not go for any la'o
I believed that love no longer existed, that they had killed him
Here you have me in love
From a baby that I haven't even played or kiss
Today you do not go for any la'o
I believed that love no longer existed, that they had killed him
Here you have me in love
From a baby that I haven't even played or kiss
[Chorus: Dalmata]
And today I dare with her
Today it may be with me dare
Today I am not going without proof of her
It rains or does not rain, oeh
The stars aligned in my favor
Today I dare with her
Today it may be with me dare
Today I am not going without proof of her
It rains or does not rain, oeh
The stars aligned in my favor
Today I dare
