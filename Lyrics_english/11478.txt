Alone, one cup (Remastered) Lyrics
Just swallow another cup like breathing
Empty drink in between
I think she will see her beyond that

With forgotten even for the first time we broke up
I talked alone as if I talked to her in memory
I drunk my eyes are blurred

OH I was as happy as a long dream
At that time, when it was great
Are you doing well? Is it okay without me
I am not okay
The more clear the more you take
She is so pretty
One drink alone whether it is alcohol or tears

Empty, fill and empty it again
With empty bottles accumulated as much as our memories
I'm empty like this uh oh

Why are you so grateful?
I'm always sorry in my memory
In the meantime with her
I always lacked uh oh

Oh clearly like yesterday
Her face drawn in front of her eyes
Are you doing well? Is it okay
I'm just stumbling tonight

The more clear the more you take
I miss her so much
I cried and laughed and resented oh
Another cup of tears again

UH oh habit like a habit alone
