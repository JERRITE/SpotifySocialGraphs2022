Whodunit Lyrics[Intro: Adam Hicks, Coco Jones]
Hey, A-plus on the track (Oh, no)
Ha, ha, oh yeah
Whodunit?

[Chorus: Adam Hicks, Coco Jones]
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
[Verse 1: Adam Hicks]
Something's going down
Hey, now, hey now, what's happening?
DJ, where you at? Where you at?
Who got this party cracka-lacka-lin'?
Don't know about you or you
But me, I'm on my one, two step
You know I do what I do
Out the box straight shuffling
It's a crime on the dance floor
The suspects are usual
This crowd's in an uproar
It's about to get critical

[Pre-Chorus: Coco Jones]
Tell me, something's going on
Get to the bottom of it
Tell me who's responsible
Tell me, whodunit-dunit-dunit?

[Chorus: Adam Hicks, Coco Jones]
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?

Is it you or you?
Huh, I don't know

[Verse 2: Adam Hicks]
This party's in overdrive
Okay, okay, who cranked it up?
Collectively, I do
Believe we about to solve a mystery
What looking for a clue
And all I see is hands up-up in the air
Bodies rocking to the vibe of the beat
'Cause the energy's packed in here

[Pre-Chorus]
This crowd's unstoppable
Is it due to the audio sounds?
It's so incredible
Whodunit now, come on

[Pre-Chorus: Coco Jones]
Tell me, something's going on
Get to the bottom of it
Tell me who's responsible
Tell me, whodunit-dunit-dunit?
[Chorus: Adam Hicks, Coco Jones]
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?

[Outro: Coco Jones, Adam Hicks]
Tell me, something's going on
Get to the bottom of it (That's right, that's right)
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?
Who got the party started?
Who got the party rockin'?
Whodunit, whodunit?
Whodun-dun-dunit?Embed
