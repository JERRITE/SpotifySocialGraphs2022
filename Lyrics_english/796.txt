Lyrics claims [letter of "me claims" ft. Ozuna & Luigi 21 Plus]

[Intro: ozuna]
I'm looking at him from his entrance
Is that Shorty as I liked
Hiding but we changed looks
And as if nothing hit me

[Pre-car: Ozuna]
I asked his name
The same asked me
She wanted me to be her man
And I wanted her to be my lady
[Chorus: Ozuna]
I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls
I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls

[Verse 1: Luigi 21 plus]
The man she always calls
Yes that's me!
The one that sucks that bowyou very rich
The one she wants, the one who most wants
With the only one that fucks when it is
Is that she prefers them, boquisucios
He wants me to get hard with the foreskin
It was put on four legs
Wants me where to peanut
Open those legs!
I am her man, she is my lady
I am her fucking, she is my baby
When it is alone it is the one who calls
I'm your favorite cat in bed

I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls
I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls

[Verse 2: Luigi 21 plus]
What happened corduroy of mine? 'What mordi'o?
She doesn't call you, that's not my problem
I am calm, she is the one who is looking for
It is not my fault that I like it
He who likes it
She told me you don't like you
That is why when you look for her
She an excuse always looks (look!)
And when he stays alone
She texts me with a hello
Asks me for a coca-cola
What do you want is a bug and ball

[Pre-car: Ozuna]
I asked his name
The same asked me
She wanted me to be her man
And I wanted her to be my lady
[Chorus: Ozuna]
I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls
I am the one who likes
Your body claims me
When you feel alone
I am the man who calls

[Outro: Ozuna & Luigi 21 Plus]
Baby (hehe)
The black -eyed black
Ozuna
Ozuna
Luigi 21 Plus
Tell it, Luian (say it, Luian)
Mambo Kingz (Mambo Kingz)
The Boquisucio (I am the one who likes it)
YAMPI (your body claims me)
I am the one who likes (when he feels alone)
It is me (I am the man who calls) embed
