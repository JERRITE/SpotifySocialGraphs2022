You will surely feel it with me

Bill,_______
Something, you weren't mai, snoring
Advocating, Sandunga vamo al mambo
That role of good girl does not have
Change the movie
Tonight you're going to be sorry
Cucano the king of the discotequeo
And there is pela
Cucano to which the tuesta toas
And there is pela
No forgiveness with reggaeton theme
Mami Ponte, feel the leon as it bites
Today you will make a loved woman for a good gangster
But tomorrow, without strength and without winning
You Might Also Likesi are not going to dance

And speak clear if we are going to tie you
That I want to dance with you, bacillate with you
Let's go out outside
NENA Don't put that face
You don't have bad flow
Let yourself go for the desire
Get off well, don't get spoiled
Or I'm going to have to give a pair of buttocks
_________ your leon pa zato
That is eaten to the dishes

So your mother becomes a potron

And you decide mai I kill me, I kill you
Then don't accuse me of abuse
Give me a mami strike make me a scribble
The outburst is going up
If you are not doing naa

If you are not doing naa
(OHH)

If you are not going to dance
Do not put me foal
That you don't have that role of baby
No, you come to me that you don't do na, you are big
If you are not going to dance
Do not put me foal
That you don't have that role of baby
No, you come to me that you don't do na, you are big
