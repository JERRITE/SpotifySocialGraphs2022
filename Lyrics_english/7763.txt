Watching You Watch Him LyricsI love you
From the bottom of my heart
And that's not gonna change, but things look grim
When I am watching you watch him
I give you
The best a man can hope to give
But I'm not feeling brave, chances are slim
When I am watching you watch him

CHORUS
Oh, what is left to learn
When he would let you crash and burn
He never gives attention but you still yearn
Where do I fit in
When I am watching you watch him
God only knows why I still wait around
Except I hate to see you cry
And I need you
But there are things I cannot do

I want you
When he's playing all his games
And it gets hard to tell who's the victim
When I am watching you watch him
Oh, what is left to learn
When he would let you crash and burn
He never gives attention but you still yearn
Where do I fit in
When I am watching you watch him

God only knows why I still wait around
Except I hate to see you cry
And I need you
But there are things I cannot do

And I love you
Like a broken record plays
But I'm a window pane, a phantom limb
When I am watching you watch him
When I am watching you watch him
When I am watching you watch him
When I am watching you watch himYou might also likeEmbed
