Banana Klip Lyrics[Intro]
You already know what the fuck goin' on
Haha
Gang, gang gang
Mwah

[Chorus]
Banana clip if that monkey bitch wanna bang
We are not friends, lil' bitch, I just want your chain
My choppa sang, didn't know you before, then you are not gang
Banana clip if that monkey bitch wanna bang
We are not friends, lil' bitch, I just want your chain
My choppa sang, didn't know you before, then you are not gang
[Verse]
Yeah, you not gang, I did the show and I copped a chain
Fifty rounds bitch, yes, I got aim
I got out of jail and this shit the same
And to me, she a side, and to you, she a main
I'm pimping baby, yeah, I'm playing game
Please do not call me, I'm out of range (Hello?)
Unless it's 'bout money, then make it rain (Hello?)
Let's check, just making money, make that pussy wet
I started rappin', now they upset
She'sâ€‹ been my bitch since we first met
Hot damn, I am going Super Saiyan
I am hotter than a pan
Ask your bitch who I am
Taxing niggas, Uncle Sam
Sliming niggas, Dirty Dan
I am poppin' like a can
I'm rockin' out with no band
On the top of the list is the plan
Road runner like a Uber man
I got the tricks, yes, I'm Superman
Why are you cuffing that bitch? Are you stupid, man?
All of my bitches about it, they do the plan

[Chorus]
Banana clip if that monkey bitch wanna bang
We are not friends, lil' bitch, I just want your chain
My choppa sang, didn't know you before, then you are not gang
Banana clip if that monkey bitch wanna bang
We are not friends, lil' bitch, I just want your chain
My choppa sang, didn't know you before, then you are not gangYou might also like1Embed
