Lyricsletra loner checked from "lonely" with lay

[Verse 1]
Baby, understand, I don't need you why
Great pleasure in satisfying me
I took a few pass, I won in the Corres
I know what I'm going to defend
Don't depend on you, boy!
Expensive cars, gold chains, leather jackets
Never made me smile
Many guys, hide their guys
In the most expensive brands
And they don't know what it is to smile
What is the meaning of this?
If mine has not guaranteed
Listen to the sixth sense
I opened my own company
This is how I invest
I didn't expect a good party
If you arrive, I'll have left
Depending on the unforeseen
That's what I live, and I think
This I think worthy
[Chorus]
Lonely makes your sexy like that
For you is not a tene, take your hand out of me
The boxes beat me
In hand is teno drink
Baby, call me
call me
call me
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Take your hand out of me
The boxes beat me
In hand is teno drink
Baby, call me
call me
call me

[Bridge]
PURL UP, PUNANNY LAY, BADNESS GYAL

[Verse 2]
I turned my heart, that from vibrating so much
The battery was over I had to recharge
TAKE IN CHOCK, IN THE HAND OF THESE LOKE
Who thinks "runs away", the pile has to carry
I already knew you were going to roll up!
The background: I went out to dance
Wine the party, thrombus with the ghettosa at the ball
Woman, black and poor. From Ragga to Pop, I go up to Ibope
Humble, never snub. Can't stand it, don't get involved
Want to give change? My cache
Do you think it's little? Want more? So take
Why do you have a name? It's too little
Do you pay the bill? I give the change
You might also like [exit]
Lonely makes your sexy like that
The boxes beat me
In hand is teno drink
Lonely makes your sexy like that
The boxes beat me
In hand is teno drink
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Sexy like that, sexy like that
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Lonely makes your sexy like that
Lonely does, lonely does
Sexy like that, sexy so2embed
