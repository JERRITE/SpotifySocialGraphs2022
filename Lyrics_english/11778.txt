The best in my life Lyricsquien can prohibit me that I mention your air
Who can prohibit me from dreaming of you at night
Who can divide us if this love is different
And I swear there is no one to move away from you

Who is going to steal those moments of infinite happiness
Who will prohibit me from love you and that you are always mine
And although I swear among us, for me you are not prohibited
Who will prohibit me from giving you the best in my life

When a person who loves you is not in this world
Here I will be to tell you that I wait for you until I die
And I repeat one and a thousand times for me you are not prohibited
Who will prohibit me from giving you the best in my life
Who can prohibit me from missing you when you miss
Is that I do not pretend and if these do not have wings
Who can prohibit me from losing your calm
Who can prohibit me from giving you my soul

Who is going to steal those moments of infinite happiness
Who will prohibit me from love you and that you are always mine
And although there is a point between us for me you are not prohibited
Who will prohibit me from giving you the best in my life

When a person who loves you is not in this world
Here I will be to tell you that I wait for you until I die
And I repeat one and a thousand times for me you are not prohibited
Who will prohibit me from giving you the best in my life
