Paste to the wall (remix) lyrics [intro: tego calderon & cencho]
Hey, this ta ', super dark that (it is not seen)
Hey, what was it (leave the Perse, that is not seen)
Tego Calderón, Plan B
For the 'he likes on the wall (like you and I do not' squeeze 'clothes)
Tell him (as you kissed our mouths)
(Leave the perse, which is not seen) it is not seen, it is not seen, and to me what

Pa 'what' he 'like on the wall, in the dark
Pa 'what' he 'like on the wall
Give it up if you fall 'I upload you
But paste 'to the wall, but stick' to the wall
E-e-e-e 'pure, pure (how)
Without any game, pa 'what' he 'like on the wall, in the dark
Pal 'Sudor looks for the most puercúo'
From here they do not move me, nor the 'executioner'
To the change you want to be often
They wear more than a knot
Pa 'what' he 'like on the wall, in the dark
Pa 'what' he 'like on the wall
Give it up if you fall 'I upload you
But stick 'to the wall

[Verse 2; Corny]
Like on foot, but this is Bellaqueo Miss
And I tell you that I am Leo, you tell me that you are Pisces
Darling does not matter then give me a sipi
That what I want on the wall and make you a quickie
To the cecitoso, to the hippie
Smoking Krippy
I'm not cheapie, I already have the trickie
Agüipitío that cannot with this trio
I bless ', I like to see that I' mine

[Verse 3: Tego Calderon]
SIN-SIN-SIN-SIN WITHOUT ALGARABÍA, CALLAO ', mute
Safe sex, how I heal me
I doubt the bad, at your flow
You don't like Bellaqueo, look mikha stopped
There are many ma ', that' so pa 'theirs
I give up, the puyo, tomorrow or greet her
By pichaera, after beef
Because it is accompanied in the dissimulation

[Verse 4: Tego Calderon]
Look, I don't exhibit, I like hiding '
I 'hit the' pollito ', they don't even say pio
I continue, I continue until the active (millet)
Where does not see us na ', pending pillo
Much Gánster of Lie like El Pacino and Niro
They have never seen 31k in cash
They want to be evil 'and another lover
You danced to'a the night and detisacá 'you stayed
Without fear, even if you don't know us' in confidence
Face 'and bad but good, excellent decision
It is in the best hands Tego Calde with plan B dele to down

Give it up if you fall 'I upload you
But paste 'to the Parededumbed
