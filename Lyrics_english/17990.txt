Start of Something New (Gina Version) Lyrics[Verse]
Livin' in my own world, didn't understand
That anything can happen when you take a chance
I never believed in what I couldn't see
I never opened my heart to all the possibilities, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here, tonight
[Chorus]
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something newYou might also like1Embed
