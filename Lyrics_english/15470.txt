What beautiful Lyrics, why do you look at me like this?
While I got without you
Remember this body well
What was yours to pleasure
To love and deceive
You no longer wet your lips
Nor insinu me your desire
You are so beautiful and sensual
I don't know if I will leave
Now or better later
And I wish you to die
What does this matter is the last time
Pride can wait
But I regret the floor
Wherever and take me
How beautiful when you love me like this
And you bite every part of me
How beautiful your jealousy is
That you feel every time I'm leaving
While I dress
You prepare a tè
And I always hope to listen
That usual lie that does not let me go
Confident you approach me
And I drink from your hands the tè
There are so beautiful and sensual
I don't know if I will leave now or better later
And I wish you to die
What does this matter is the last time
Pride can wait
But I regret the floor
Wherever and take me
How beautiful when you love me like this
And you bite every part of me
How beautiful your jealousy is
That you feel every time I'm leaving
How beautiful when you love me like this
And you bite every part of me
How beautiful your jealousy is
That you feel every time I'm leaving
Every time I vieyou miGht Also Likeembed
