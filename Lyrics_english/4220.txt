The Lyrics Doctorate ["El Doctorate" letter]]

[Verse 1]
Today I think when I met you (which I met you)
And I realize that I lost everything without you (all without you)
Life taught me that I loved you born (pa 'love you was born)
But I didn't learn to forget you and how to do without you
I have everything, more than I thought (what I thought)
I feel more than without you I lost, that I failed (that I failed)
I took the highest score in love (higher in love)
But it is worth it (Tony Dize)
[Bridge]
I have great knowledge
I have a doctorate more than that
I have a graduate heart in feeling
With the note that nobody has ever achieved
I have my dreams with you
Everything you have taught me
Nothing that I know is feigned
Everything I have, more or less I lost it

[Pre-car]
I don't know how to do without you
Having everything, nothing runs out of you
What is it worth? (What is it worth?)
If you are not here by my side of anything it is worth
I don't know how to do without you
Having everything, nothing runs out of you
What is it worth? (What is it worth?)
The thousand diplomas, a thousand honors of nothing are worth me

[Chorus]
I live in love and crazy
I live and crazy without you
If you are not here, here by my side
You're welcome what I know and my doctorate
I live in love and crazy
I live and crazy without you
If you are not here, here by my side
You're welcome what I know and my doctorate

I have a country house
With thousands of prizes on the table
I have my career and my bank accounts
I want to live and die of love

[Pre-car]
I don't know how to do without you
Having everything, nothing runs out of you
What is it worth? (What is it worth?)
If you are not here by my side of anything it is worth
I don't know how to do without you
Having everything, nothing runs out of you
What is it worth? (What is it worth?)
The thousand diplomas, a thousand honors of nothing are worth me

[Chorus]
I live in love and crazy
I live and crazy without you
If you are not here, here by my side
You're welcome, what I know and my doctorate
I live in love and crazy
I live and crazy without you
If you are not here, here by my side
You're welcome, what I know and my doctorate

That this song is marked forever
