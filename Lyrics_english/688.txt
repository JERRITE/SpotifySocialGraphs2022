TranslationEnglishbichota Lyrics ["Bichota" letter]

[Pre-car]
I go out aim 'standing' butt
Because it may be that with my ass tapes (oh)
I feel bichota without leaving the block (ah)
They want to leave for me and they don't have what

[Chorus]
Roncan, but they can't with my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
And if there is someone who breaks me
Because they can't with my pum-pum
With my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
[Verse 1]
Above it shows that I have plenty of picket, picket
No 'Dimo' a couple of bottle 'and now he was' to Garеte
I also have a jeepeta
The Tеngo Fuleteá 'with To'a Mi' Shortie '
Dejamo 'Fear in the drawer, ah-ah
Take care with what goes up 'pa'l story
And guess who comes around
Juana comes, Mari comes
To'a the 'babie' want party
A commentary outside 'e place and
And I watched you 'to break, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah

[Pre-car]
I go out and butt (ey)
Because it may be that with my ass tapes (eh)
I feel bichota without leaving the block (ah)
They want to leave for me and they don't have what

[Chorus]
Roncan, but they can't with my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
And if there is someone who breaks me
Because they can't with my pum-pum
With my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
Roncan, but they can't with my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
And if there is someone who breaks me
Because they can't with my pum-pum
With my pum-pum, with my pum-pum
