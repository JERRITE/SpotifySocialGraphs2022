Overrated Lyrics[Chorus]
Ayy, you ain't even gotta say it
What’s understood don't need to be complicated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin'
Just give me loyalty, ’cause love is overrated, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you love when we shaded (Sheesh)
Ducked off, they hate it when we isolated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin'
Just want your loyalty, the love is overrated

[Post-Chorus]
Are you down to bleed the streets with me?
Or could you be blinded by all this ice you see?
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
But no relationships involved
I just need your loyalty, that's all
Don't need love
[Chorus]
You ain't even gotta say it
What's understood don't need to be complicated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin’
Just give me loyalty, ’cause love is overrated, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you love when we shaded (Sweet)
Ducked off, they hate it when we isolated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin'
Just want your loyalty, the love is overrated, yeah

[Verse]
You know I forever lit
Money ain’t nothing if you got nobody to share it with
Heart on my sleeve, but got a problem with wearing it
Time ain't free, so if you got it then cherish it
You know the code, never switch, my love been legit
You know I'ma go all out for my (Sheesh)
And if we ever fall out, get a grip, get it right back
And if it's up, let it stick and it’s like that

[Chorus]
You ain't even gotta say it
What's understood don't need to be complicated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin'
Just give me loyalty, 'cause love is overrated, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you love when we shaded (Sweet)
Ducked off, they hate it when we isolated, ayy
You know we good, no reason to be explainin'
Just want your loyalty, the love is overrated, yeah

Are you down to bleed the streets with me?
Or could you be blinded by all this ice you see?
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
But no relationships involved
I just need your loyalty, that's all
Don't need love8Embed
