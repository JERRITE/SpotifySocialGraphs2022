2 Signs Lyrics[Chorus: KYNE]
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin’ throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin' throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise

[Verse 1: KYNE]
Baby let’s roll back to that reality
Findin’ us a spot on thе top of the world so you can see
That nobody’s got ahold of me
Pick a place and gеt lost with me
Find a ride or come home with me
Let's go back together, this song can last forever
With the moonlight shinin’ baby we can do whatever
While we roll back to that reality
Livin’ for the moment but caught up in where we oughta be
[Chorus: KYNE]
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin’ throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin' throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise


[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Okay she can get it I know she wit it she stay thirsty
Never quit it all up in it since the first day
Bend the corner hit the curb spot her burbs and her curves
With them knee highs on ass lookin’ absurd
Yeah it shakin’ left to right yeah she know how to move
Riding shotgun with booze gettin drunk on the loose
We throw them deuces peace signs east side my 3’s up
And I do this every night, they know we gotta stay crunk

[Chorus: KYNE]
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin’ throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin' throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise

And you can catch me outside
Smokin’ on some of that good pine
Throwin’ up deuces to the homies
All about that love and good vibes
We came from basement nights
Now we got our name up in lights
Still we out here keepin’ it 100, that fame ain't changin’ what’s right
I spent my summers, goin’ on with the people I love
Not worryin’ bout what the future holds and as time passed
We got older but that don’t mean we don’t have each other
Country baby hate it or love it that’s what made me
My mama came from Texas southern comfort is how she raised me Okay okay, beautiful days that I live for no matter the case
Basket case  with a packed suitcase
Goin’ down south for the warm sun rays
Oh R-E-double D, K-Y-N-E, day one OG’s
No cold feet on a path only singin’ out to the nosebleeds
Peace signs throw 'em up you know we be fine
Never livin’ my life on the decline, uh
Eastside Westside Northside Southside we shine
Beautiful girls with big behinds
Lookin’ mighty fine in those knee-highs
Won’t you be mine?

[Chorus: KYNE]
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin’ throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunrise
She was in her knee highs, I was in my Levis
We were in the backroads swervin' throwin' peace signs
We don’t stop for red lights, tryna have the best night
Grab another Bud Light, we're drinking 'til the sunriseEmbed
