Mood Swing Misery Lyrics[Verse 1: Pouya]
Drowning in my misery, up to my neck with memories
I don't feel like remembering, I feel like I'm not growing at all
Honestly, I kind of miss the neglect
'Cause nowadays everybody at my head for a check, yeah
I got addicted with the feeling of isolation
If I die, spit on my grave in hopes I'm not reincarnated
'Cause I'm exhausted and lost in the sauce
And I feel like my mind is faded
Throw up my set then throw your shade
Tell me how much you hate me
[Chorus: Rocci]
Mood swing misery, the ups and downs keep killing me
Never thought I'd let you get to me, now I'm falling gradually
Mood swing misery, feel like everybody is watching me
Can't seem to shake it off of me, pulling all the life from me
Mood swing misery, mood swing misery

[Verse 2: Pouya]
My biggest regret was letting you fall in love with me
Everything that I get close to falls apart eventually
My destiny is testin' me, my testimony won't let me sleep
Time heals all wounds so I've been waitin' patiently
'Cause I'm not Wolverine
Told my demons back up off me, but they took control of me
Enemies surrounding me, tryna fold me like origami
Got me grippin' on my lifesaver
Holdin' my breath, hopin' for tomorrow
Life ain't for the weak, I feel the pain until I'm hollow

[Chorus: Rocci]
Mood swing misery, the ups and downs keep killing me
Never thought I'd let you get to me, now I'm falling gradually
Mood swing misery, feel like everybody is watching me
Can't seem to shake it off of me, pulling all the life from me
Mood swing misery, mood swing misery
Mood swing misery, mood swing miseryYou might also like10Embed
