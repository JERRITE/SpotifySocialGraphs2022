El Dorado Lyrics [produced by Jaegen & Hamza]

[Verse 1: Hamza]
A bunch of rage but we live with
All the time currency that calls
Fuck the one who lives with you
Since the time I was waiting for you, Baby, has been going with me
You don't get carried away, I just want to share my spliff with you
When her pussy slides like alpine skiing
I know what you like, I finally like you
In particular your poom poom, fight its pussy as at the kung fu
Bitch, you're going to shout like Camp Nou
I would come and bang you every weekend
Pussy wet like at Vittel
Put it in the mouth, no need for oxygen
Booty so fat, Mamí, there is something to have the migraine
[Refrain: Hamza]
Yo Mamí, undress quickly, put yourself in the water
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid
One day I take a cold, one day I take you hot
Put yourself with water, water, water, water, water
The money calls me I am allô, hello, hello
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me, you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid

[Verse 2: Hamza]
She wants to make the biggest magazines
Give your pussy that I assassinate her
Boom in limousine, boom as if I were poutine
Boom, boom, it has become routine
Ganja and codeine, rewind
Pussy wet like a yacht, not very far from an island
I am the king, I have my currency on my masta, hey
I smoke the ganja, puff puff like a rasta
Mamí you know I'm not average, hey
Mamí moves your pom pom, I only expect that
She wants to see my anaconda, wow
Mamí moves your pom pom, I only expect that

[Refrain: Hamza]
Yo Mamí, undress quickly, put yourself in the water
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid
One day I take a cold, one day I take you hot
Put yourself with water, water, water, water, water
The money calls me I am allô, hello, hello
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me, you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid
You might also like [Pont: Hamza]
I would come and bang you every weekend
Put it in the mouth, no need for oxygen
Booty so fat, Mamí, there is something to have the migraine
I would come and bang you every weekend
Pussy wet like at Vittel
Put it in the mouth, no need for oxygen
Booty so fat, Mamí, there is something to have the migraine

[Verse 3: Ramriddlz]
Baby girl your pussy, still near
All i nique, beautiful, so wet
Dance with me, dance for me, Olala
She know i'm sweet 'cause i eat anana
It's always the story, you want me every night
Open mouth like ah, ah
When I arrive on the stage
Vagina as a swimming pool
I hit you like a pimp
Take Lean, cocaine, 'cause i never seen
White Things from Montreal They my French Vanillas
They wish that i can fuck 'em all, i'm a pum pum killa
But i just wanna hit the mall, fuck up all my skrilla
Fuck Up All My Skrilla
All My Chocolate Nutella Hella Bella, She My Cinderella
Hit it raw no salmonella when i'm deep up in her
Swimma swimma swimma swimma i be swimmin in her
I might just skip the gyma just to hit her with no jimma
Just wear your makeup
I'm going to laugh your face on the beach
Fuck you like that, on the sand
I am lost in the clouds
Come, co-Co-Come, Come Around
Shawty Let's Burn One Down
Come, co-Co-Come, Come Around
Shawty Let's Burn One Down
[Refrain: Hamza]
Yo Mamí, undress quickly, put yourself in the water
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid
One day I take a cold, one day I take you hot
Put yourself with water, water, water, water, water
The money calls me I am allô, hello, hello
Yo Mamí, I don't know what happens to me, you make me addicted
Since we frequent, I admit I have become paranoid

[Outro: Ramriddlz & Hamza]
I WANNA FUCK YOU EVERY DAY AND EVERY Weekend
Every Day and Every Weekend, Baby
It's Always Better Off Them Drugs, I'm a Heathen
Mountain in the back i might fuck you on the peak while you're peaking
That's the Highest High, Oh
I'M TRYNA FRY MY EYES AND GO UP
High likes, bird, bird, bird, bird
Put yourself with water, water, water, water, water
The money calls me I am allô, hello, hello
So fat mamí got that grapefruit, yeah5embed
