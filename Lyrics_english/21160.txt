The Saddest Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know this is coming to an end
Aware of all the pain that will ensue
And when it leaves a hole inside my chest
I'm not sure how I'll cover up the wound

[Pre-Chorus]
My body's filled with my regret
And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh
[Chorus]
Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh

[Verse 2]
Maybe you'll be on your way to work
And hear it when you're driving down the street
And maybe then you'll wanna make things work
And tell me that you never wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
My body's filled with my regret
And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh

[Chorus]
Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I know that we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mhYou might also like6Embed
