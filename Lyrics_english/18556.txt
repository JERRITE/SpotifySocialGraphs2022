I Just Wanna Run Lyrics[Chorus]
I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run, throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run

[Verse 1]
I just wanna run
I'm out here all alone
I try to call your house
Can't reach you on the phone
I'll gather up the nerve
I'm packing up my bag
It's more than you deserve
Don't treat me like a drag
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feelin' like I keep on talking
I'm repeating myself
My words lost all meaning
I keep talking
I repeat myself

[Chorus]
I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run, throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run (Oh, oh, oh)
I just wanna run (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Like a game of chess
I predict your move
I think I know you better
Better than you do
I'm sick of feeling cheap
Cheated and abused
Sick of losing sleep
Thinking about you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feelin' like I keep on talking
I'm repeating myself
My words lost all meaning
I keep talking
I repeat myself

I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run, throw it away
Run before they're finding me out
I just wanna run (Oh, oh, oh)
I just wanna run (Oh, oh, oh) throw it away

[Bridge]
I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run, throw it away
Run before they're finding me out (Out)

[Chorus]
I just wanna run (I just wanna run)
I just wanna run, hide it away
Run because they're chasing me down
I just wanna run, throw it away
Run before they're finding me out

[Outro]
I just wanna run (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I just wanna run (Won’t find me out, won’t find me out)
