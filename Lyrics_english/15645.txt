Don't be afraid
I believed in you and what I feel today
Don't be afraid, discover love
What can I give you

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid, let yourself love
I will never hurt you
I just ask you to be with me
Just one opportunity is enough for me
Give me love, I'm going to fall in love
Come here and you will know how and how much I love you
I met you, and in a moment
I decided, you would be for me
In your gaze I could see the light
And I knew what you were

[Chorus]
Do not be afraid, let yourself love
I will never hurt you
I just ask you to be with me
Just one opportunity is enough for me
Give me love, I'm going to fall in love
Come here and you will know how and how much I love you

Don't be afraid, listen to your heart, love

You came to me, and at one point I believed in you

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid, let yourself love
I will never hurt you
I just ask you to be with me
Just one opportunity is enough for me
Give me love, I'm going to fall in love
Come here and you will know how and how much I love you

I love you, oh
You might also like just one opportunity is enough
Give me love, I'm going to fall in love
Come here and you will know how and how much I love you
