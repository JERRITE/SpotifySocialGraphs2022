Until I Lost You LyricsWe were just kids when we met and we fell in love
I was naive, made mistakes didn’t know enough
Don’t know what I was thinking
When I let you go

It must be fate that brought us together again
Life is too short girl let’s give us a second chance
I know that you got your doubts so I’m ready to make this vow
This time around I won’t let you go

I promise from this day to love you right
I’m not gonna give you up this time
Whatever wrong I did I learned my lesson
Girl I didn’t know what I was missing
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you
Until I lost you
Every moment apart gave me time to grow
I know that I will love you better than before
Let’s let go of the past baby we’ll make new memories
Spend my whole life with you baby we’ll start a family

Cause I don’t want nobody with me if I can’t have you
And all of these it don’t mean nothing if it ain’t with you
I’m putting my heart on the line with you for the rest of my life
This time around I won’t let you go

I promise from this day to love you right
I’m not gonna give you up this time
Whatever wrong I did I learned my lesson
Girl I didn’t know what I was missing
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you, lost you baby
Until I lost you
