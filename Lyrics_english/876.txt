Ideal Lyrics Girl [Ideal Girl lyrics "]

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
Blessings to Every Gyal Who Wanna Have A Romp With Man Feelings
I, ah, me Wanna Live My Life Here, Baby
Ayy Yatra, Guaynaa, Guaynaa
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
I must confess, now I'm looking for something else
A reason to fall in love again (you may be you)

[Pre-Caro: Guaynaa]
I want a girl (girl)
I want one (now)
The love of my life (my life)
One that can love (love)
[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Guaynaa]
I want a girl, I want a gyal
I want a woman who is very special
I want a lady who knows how to love me
And of course he knows how to wiggle, oh-yyah
I want a girl, I want a gyal
I want a woman who is very special (ey, ey)
I want a lady who knows how to love me (the Guaynaabichy; Gyal, Gyal)

[Post-Coro Guaynaa]
What-do not say no, no, no, no, no, that
That touches it and is alroco-what-what-what-what
What dance and rebound-boote-boote-boote
That's why I love her, for her to love me
What-do not say no, no, no, no, no, that
That touches it and is alroco-what-what-what-what
What dance and rebound-boote-boote-boote
That's why I love her, for her to love me

[Verse: guaynaa]
I ride a boat
I have crossed the sea, I have uploaded the river
For you 'look me a thousand mess'
I want me to hug me in Bogotá, at night there is cold
And that I have my hair, mommy, while I fall asleep. '
I need someone to talk
I need someone to laugh and someone cry
Someone who eats a lot, someone who goes out to rumbar
Pa 'take away the' taco 'when he arrives' from dancing (of dance)

[Bridge: Guaynaa & Sebastián Yatra]
If I were you a little about that attitude
That it has me 'and you distant, think about it for a moment
It may be that I love you
If I were you a little about that attitude
That has me from you distant, think about it for a moment
It may be that I love you, baby
