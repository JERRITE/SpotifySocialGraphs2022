Little Know It All Lyrics[Verse 1: Iggy Pop]
I'm the kid that no one knows
I live a life I never chose
But these thoughts in my mind
Are my own, my own

[Verse 2: Iggy Pop]
I'm face-to-face with the unknown
My scary movie will be shown
I've got one evil mind
Of my own, of my own
[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Sum 41]
We take from one another
We never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side
But nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you surprised?
Little know it all (_little know it all_)
Ten bucks in my hand
Little know it all (little know it all)
Don't cry, I understand
(So!)

[Verse 3: Iggy Pop]
I'm a target of the smart
They got ambition, I got heart
I'm analyzed and tagged
Before I start

[Verse 4: Iggy Pop & Sum 41]
So tell me who can I respect?
I feel the leash around my neck
As I find out there's shame
In the game (in the game)

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Sum 41]
We take from one another
We never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side
But nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you surprised?
You might also like[Bridge: Iggy Pop & Sum 41]
And I feel like I'm caught outside the box
And I feel like I'm sleeping when I'm not

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Sum 41]
We take from one another
We never stop to wonder
How it feels from the other side
But nothing lasts forever
When stupid turns to clever
Why are you surprised?
Little know it all (little know it all)
Ten bucks in my hand
Little know it all (little know it all)
Don't cry, I understand
You little know it all (little know it all)
Ten bucks in my hand
Little know it all (little know it all)
Don't cry I understand
You'll never know it all1Embed
