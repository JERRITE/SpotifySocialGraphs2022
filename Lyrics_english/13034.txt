Nocturne Lyrics[Intro]
If you fall, I'll catch you

[Verse 1]
So I've been thinking 'bout something
Lately I've been alive
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control
[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame?
When we've only ourselves to blame?

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more
(Dream no more)

[Verse 2]
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have
So I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking
Maybe I'll figure all this out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame?
And we've only ourselves to blame?

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
