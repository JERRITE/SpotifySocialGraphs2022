Aidus Lyrics[Intro]
Immos nertaci
Immos exsobnī
Immos riī
Immos Segī
Immos nertaci
Immos exsobnī
Immos riī
Immos Segī

[Verse 1]
Immos nertaci
Immos exsobnī
Immos riī
Immos Segī
In the name of Ànu
In the presence divine
We pledge our blood to be shed in war
[Verse 2]
We're lurching in a bloodsoaked
Dystopian dream
Sleepwalking towards the yawning abyss
The throne of lies touts iniquity as good
This is martial law
The final battle has begun

[Verse 3]
We're black-wholed in a synthetical phantom neverland
Latch locked out of the presence of the gods
In a world of nothing but mirrors and smoke
We were walking the line
And swallowed sainted truths

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're uprising
We're awakening
We are change
The change to come

[Chorus]
Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
As above so below

Hark!
The avengers have pulled
He cold kneel from nethersleep
Awoke the astray
Deadlocked the rack rat race of the enslaved
This is martial law
The rebellion has begun

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
For we are flood
We are fire
We're the voice of the gods
We are one
We are legion
We are rebellion
We are change
The change to come

[Chorus]
Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
As above so below
Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
Life will conquer and reign beyondEmbed
