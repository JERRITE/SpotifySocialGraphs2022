The Emptyâ€™s Response LyricsBehind the sky there I'm
I'm trying to reach you
Without a clue I disguise
I am nothing

Won't you rule my heart
Seems you already own my life
If only I can come and see you die
It'd be the only reason why

You're being the impossible
Things who realize
When you let yourself be so
There am I
What the coward lies behind
Your now is gone
My before is your now
And why I was gone

We're doomed to survive for a day
The only way we thrive
The empty's response to why

The emptiest response to whyYou might also likeEmbed
