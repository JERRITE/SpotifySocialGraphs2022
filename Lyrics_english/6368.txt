THE GREAT UNKNOWN Lyrics[Intro]
Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now my ears are ringing
It's getting close

[Verse 1]
Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now the room is spinnin'
It's getting closer now
[Verse 2]
I've been waiting for the great leap forwards
So impatient, yeah, I wanna cut corners
I stare at the skyline, reach for a lifeline
I shout into the great unknown

[Chorus]
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown

[Post Chorus]
Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now the room is spinnin'
It's getting closer now

[Verse 3]
Oh, the beauty of the twilight glows
Oh, the delusion of Vincent van Gogh
A red sky at night, a shepherd's flashlight
His beam sweeps like brush strokes across the sky
You might also like[Chorus]
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown

[Bridge]
Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now my ears are ringing
It's getting close

[Chorus]
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown
If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknownEmbed
