Let you carry lyrics [letter of "let you carry" ft. Lyanno]

[Intro]
D-Note is on the beat
"The Beatllione"

[Pre-stribe: Alex Rose]
Shorty, I know what you want
I know a long time (oh)
Sending photos to warm up
Thinking that I never vo'a getting
And now that you have me straight
Tell me what do you plan to do? (OH)
If you want to be beautiful but before
[Chorus: Alex Rose]
Baby, let me touch you
I want to confess
What a long time ago I want to undress (OH)
You just let go, drool
What then is it late
I know that you want me too (from me)
(You just let me touch you, oh)
(You just let go, Babe, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah)

[Verse 1: Alex Rose]
I didn't look for anything, but I found you
Your jevo doesn't know anything, so forget about him
We are just you and me, let's turn off the cel
Baby, take off your clothes, what do I want to do
I've been waiting for you for a while (OH)
Killing me, as crazy wanting you (Yeh)
Seeing your photo, I imagine devouring you
Like Kalimba, I don't know what I do looking for you
But I want to eat you

[Bridge: Alex Rose]
And I'm still waiting for you
Killing me as crazy wishing you (Yeh)
Seeing your photo imagining devouring you
Like Kalimba, I don't know what I do looking for you
