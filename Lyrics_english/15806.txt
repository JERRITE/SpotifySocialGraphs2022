In one of those lyricsen one of those, I turn on all the stars off
And I take you to a world where nothing hurts you
Neither lies, nor looks
In one of those, we risk and jumped together
I bet on your heart that you have always been mine
I play it, it's not cold
In one of those, I can be the great love for which
That winning ticket you dream about
Today is the day, you can know if you kiss me
In one of those, I am the fire that your body is waiting for
I put the fire you tell me how and when
In one of those we are already falling in love
In one of those, we make our paradise in a stroke of luck
We will escape where he does not even find death
Give me green light to love you
In one of those, I can be the great love for which
That winning ticket you dream about
Today is the day, you can know if you kiss me
In one of those, I am the fire that your body is waiting for
I put the fire you tell me how and when
In one of those we are already falling in love withyou might also likembed
