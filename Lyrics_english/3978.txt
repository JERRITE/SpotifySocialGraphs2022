TranslationEnglishdeutschun Lyrics Weight [letter of "one weight" ft. Marciano Cantero]

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
What are you going to love me if I already told you goodbye?
If I already said goodbye to you, I don't want to know more about your kisses
What are you going to love me? I already gave you forgiveness
The resentment has never been in me
Now whatever you do is a weight
What are you going to love me?

[Verse 1: j Balvin]
For what? If we are in other stage 'and I already forgot you?
If for you I fell, fell and got up
With whom you came, he already left
I have come to me for reasons that you have already broken hearts
Treating 'and fill empty that you don't even fill with gallons
Yes, this is for drunk intons'
I just miss doing it without condone '
And rightly so, so little it hurt
From Cora 'that I was not the one who took off
And your idiot heart will always miss me, Baby
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
What are you going to love me if I already told you goodbye?
If I already said goodbye to you, I don't want to know more about your kisses
What are you going to love me? I already gave you forgiveness
The resentment has never been in me
Now whatever you do is a weight

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
I loved you, I loved you
But those days are over
Now you cry, repentant
Thinking about me, while 'coffee cools you
I'm sure you miss my mole
And not having anyone to breakfast
I'm sorry, my love, I just gave my place
Look for another heart to play
I was religious, I worshiped you
The moon knows what I cried for you
When I was sad and you never came
But normal
Calm, that I am not going to talk badly
I can forgive you, but never forget
Don't talk to me pretty, I come back and repeat

[Chorus: J Balvin, Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
What are you going to love me if I already told you goodbye?
If I already said goodbye to you, I don't want to know more about your kisses
What are you going to love me? I already gave you forgiveness
The resentment has never been in me
Now whatever you do is a weight
You Might Also Like [verse 3: Marciano Cantero]
You can not do the aesthetic surgery of the soul
To change something that does not fail you
Your cornerstone, your cornerstone
What are you going to love me!
I existed if you imagined
And I jumped if you said "frog"
But I got tired of being your asshole

[Bridge: Marciano Cantero]
Why did you lose sensitivity?
You left alone without looking back
You learned to differentiate, what it seems and what it is
What is written in the stars
What is written on paper
Other loves are also, like Forrest Gump's girlfriend
The clock says on the wall, if our love ended yesterday
What are you going to love me, what are you going to love me?

[Choir: Marciano Cantero & Bad Bunny]
What are you going to love me if I already told you goodbye?
If I already said goodbye to you, I don't want to know more about your kisses
What are you going to love me? I already gave you forgiveness
The resentment has never been in me
Now what you do is worth a weight14embed
