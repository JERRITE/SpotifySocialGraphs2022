[Verse 1: almighty]
I travel without seeing, sewing bastons and I don't know how to weave
I drew a star to the short and will protect me
I am like the Uzi that I am from Israel
Bastard, I'm an old man like Bill Russell
Don't say you're a boss if you're not your boss
And your boss for me that e 'your cell
Jon z, we are beasts, I illuminates me celestia
I travel without seeing, I travel without discomfort, Yeh
I bought two rolett, I don't believe in modesty
I nail your whore because it is an insectia
And also to her friend because I am the beast
I'm always picando, I'm always getting rid
To your whore enleccando, these people keep stalking me
To your whore I sow, but you are reaping it
I am that gamer, of this call of duty who always kills them Rushando
Almighty!

I travel without seeing, guiding without looking (Yeh-Yeh)

Pa 'me is normal to invoice, money tell (Yeah)
They said that the whores have me blind and I put mirror flows abdul-jabbar (with 35 pikete ')
Pa 'pichar and more flirting asses (ligar asses; ey)
People began to speculate, that I live crazy and that my life is a crical (Yeh-Yeh; Ey-Ey)
The pattern of evil and I do not speak of Escobar (no)
"As of swords" champagne, I don't drink Brugal (ey-ey)
They say they want to kill me
And I do the blind man, who is going to 'lie? (Prrrrr!)
I walk with a white stick and it is not of non-president (no-no-not)
People are the one that will not see when the stick Detone (Hol 'Up)
Because I'm chining on the way, they say that I am crashing (wait-wait-wait)
And I without seeing, traveling the world, Flow Beethoven (Yeh-Yeh!)

I travel without seeing
[Verse 3: from the ghetto]
I like-me like culona ', trgueña' like cardi b
Livesto 'An ounce of Sour Die'
Your baby calls me what wants to come
And I from Bellaco, I say yes
The bastard note like Héctor Lavoe
Of what I enrolo in RAW papers
Champagne with Molly Pa 'Dar with To'
The vo 'foured that the chulito arrived
Point out in a row that I want a chupop
Stop one, stop you do '
Bring your friend to give the do '
Or bring me three that this fell
After I go, I don't want to see them
She saying that she wants again
I travel without seeing, I travel without seeing
And I command the Uber pa 'house of the former

[Bridge: De la Ghetto, Noriel]
There are many bordering, many bordering (ah-ah)
And you see them paying a moët between die '(they do not na')
Many bordering, there are many bordering here (no-no-)
And we with the Cuban as Frankie Ruiz
(Chulo Flow, Hommie; Noriel, Ah-Ah)

[Verse 4: Noriel, Juaka "El Problematik"]
I travel without seeing, I travel without flying (aha)

To put that ass to Chimiar (ah)
To me 'these whores want to pray (Yeh)
When I die, my bug is going to be in a mural (Wouh!)

And it is bastard, that until when I sleep, I keep making money (Juan-Ka!)

[Verse 5: Juaka "El Problematik", Jon Z]
I travel without vision (Yeh)
Who was Héctor Lavoe without Willie Colón? (Tell me)
Montamo 'Pressure, your legs falter when Rodman Gardea, Karl Malone (Hehe)
I keep killing until my breathing is cut (breathing, jeh)
I am not lame but inside 'the jacket I have mortea'o the cane
(Rrrrah!; Pum-pum-pum-pum)
These kilos without papers, as immigration, I am the one who sports them (Ajá)
For the comfort of my hand and for the precision the AK is trimmed
(Prrr-prrr-prrrr!)
I pick up the checks because Tuesday is deposited (yes)
Neither for heaven, nor by land, by sea I take them cheap 'in the Islite'
Your whores dancing exotic, saying that I am his platonic love (ah)
Here, we are chronic smokers (OH-OH)
I play my life, but I invest every minute of her (her minute)
Table the direct, and here I have the man that the boxes seal me
I walk above the air (aha), here the view looks better (it looks better)
Influential entrepreneur like Rockefeller in New York (and you know it)
In a black cadillac, I travel without seeing, giving replay (dale replay)
The toughest 'e the new one, on a Montamo' theme 'El Dream Team USA

[Chorus: Jon Z, De la Ghetto, Ele to "The Domain"]

[Verse 7: The alpha, Push]
I travel without seeing, and I don't have the eyes
You do not know 'how many bates I have killed
You do not know how how many asses I have killed
The 'chip in the gun' I have adapta'o (clap-clap)
With me go running '(wow)

Too much spark plug I have (wow), I put like the DEA (Whee-Uh, Whee-Uh!)
As the fourth 'I have in the bank (M-V-P!), You have no idea
(Wow-wow)

[Verse 8: Push]
I put on a bandage ', I started shooting
Pa 'inside' the vamo 'cacer' to see who is going to chote (plo-aplo)
Do not pull on radio that they fell, you bastard, they will not copy you (no)
Cancel the flights, that we take off and put José Feliciano to pilot
I travel without seeing, with the note of a steak
Quiet that if I pull the phone
The Simpsons are going to die, when Lisa sounds the saxophone
And if they want revenge, go down with your combo in confidence (Dale)
That to which the subway (prrr)
I see I see what do you see? Do you see a little thing? Magnum 357 Chinita Point
I'm going to hit you if you move, I'm going to explode if you shout
This war was curtita, I tell Tarzan
That explodes the other with chita (wow; Pusho!)

[Chorus: Jon Z, Lyan]

[Verse 9: Lyan, Jon Z]
A with me could not play
Pa'l fuck to play with three (brrr!)
I walk with jon z, you bastard, don't you see me? (Que!?)
This is the "travel without see" remix
Jon z said that buzzed and left
Juanka said to cook them
I come from the ghetto as of the ghetto
With domain that commands outside
It is mounted in the remix by José Feliciano
Traveling without seeing, I willn't grab me 'the hand
Do not tell me "brother" that I don't know 'brother
Don't tell me "brother" I'm not your brother, Wuh
I'm with a Miky last name Woodz
Smoking, burning backwoods
Somo 'trap capos and changed you' the mood
We live cool, yes, we live good
I travel without seeing
Pass the Phillies, look for the rola that I don't want Pali '
I am the consistency as Stevie Wonder
Ask Wonder how they hide, wuh
I travel without seeing
And with a scarf, the combs are long ', the Cone' are sent
None get off, none is sent
None prove me, ask the Panda!

[Verse 10: Jeycyn]
I travel without seeing, the darkness will not defeat me
To get to the top I vo'a fuck
No obstacle in my life will stop me (ey)
I don't want to be the best, but among the best I will be
That's why I tell you that we are traveling without seeing
I travel without seeing, I travel without seeing (ey)
Blind I was born, but as I want to continue
23 surgeries did not stop me (no)
One day I decided that a letter was going to write to him
Asking him if in the remix of "travel without seeing" he could leave
He told me yes, now my people, here (ey)
I'm not Feliciano, but I'm Jeycyn, yes (José Feliciano)
I was born without a view
God gave me virtue to be an artist (thanks, God)
If you do not believe me 'see how I am starting this track
I travel without seeing, I travel without seeing (ey)
I am waiting to have 18 pa 'that this takes me to d'atls

[Chorus: Jon Z]
I travel without seeing (Jose Feliciano)
I travel without seeing (Phillie in hand)
I travel without seeing (Yadiel the Martian)
I travel without seeing (the bat in hand)
I travel without seeing (José Feliciano)
I travel without seeing (Phillie in hand)
I travel without seeing (Yadiel the Martian)
I travel without seeing (the bat in hand, yi-yi-yi -i)

[Verse 11: Jon z]
"I travel without seeing," I did unintentionally
In an interview with Chente and Idelec (YI)
Tell a stick, a goal (goal!), Ronaldo and Pelé
Manito rebelled and I had what I longed for (Yeah)
I never slipped, I soak (yi)
I fell alone (yi), I got up (yi-yi)
I alone fuck myself, many things endured
And if you spoke shit, then the mouth fell to you (ah!)
José Feliciano, Phillie in his hand
Junco 'at home, I'm from Valencian (Wouh)
Yadiel the Martian, the bat in hand (YI)
It is dances to the Vatican (Yi-Yi)
José Feliciano, Phillie in his hand
Always crazy, never good and healthy (Yi)
Yadiel El Marciano, hit his hand (Yi-Yi)
This is danced to Christians (rrrah!)
I travel without seeing, Chile and Argentina
Colombia, all of Latin America (Yi-Yi)
Spain, Barcelona, Madrid, to China (suppu)
All whores, also to the fine
I travel without seeing (Yi), with idelectrox
So much drug, look 'spectrum (yi-yi-yii)
Capsulia'o throughout the Metro (Yi) area
Jordan off-white, I no longer use retro (rrrah!)
I travel with my choir, Manín, I never delay
Marijuana for the pores, I smoke it, I devour it
I never fall in love, my whores are my treasure
Treasure that I do not value, my rings are in gold (YI)
I don't smoke more marlboro, codeine improved me
Evaporo marijuana, if there is no waked drug (YI)
Capeo and ajoro, I don't cry
But when I cry is when Boto Pasto for the toilet (ahh!)
