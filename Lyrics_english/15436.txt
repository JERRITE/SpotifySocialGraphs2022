January day Lyrics [letter of "January day"]

[Verse 1]
I met you a January day
With the moon on my nose
And as I saw that you were sincere
In your eyes I lost myself
What a clumsy distraction
And what a sweet feeling
And now that we walk around the world
Like Aeneas and Benit√≠n
I already found several scratches
That they did to you around
But my crazy love
Is your best doctor
[Pre-car]
I'm going to cure your soul in duel
I'm going to leave you as new
And everything will happen
You will see the sun shine
You more than anyone you deserve to be happy

[Chorus]
You're going to see how they heal
Little by little your wounds
You're going to see how it goes
The same life to opt for the salt that is left over in the sea

[Verse 2]
And even if you have been a foreigner
Even in your own country
If I tell you: "How do you say?"
You still say: "What do you say?"
And you cry of emotion hearing a bandoneon

[Pre-car]
And though you seem absent minded with that lazy walk
I know the reason that your heart hurts
That's why I wanted to make this song

[Chorus]
You're going to see how they heal
Little by little your wounds
You're going to see how it goes
The same life to opt for the salt that is left over from the sea
You're going to see how they heal
Little by little your wounds
You're going to see how it goes
The same life to opt for the salt that is left over from Maryou Might Also Like2embed
