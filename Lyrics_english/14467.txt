[Intro]
(YEH-YEH-YEH-YEH, YEH-YEH-YEH-YEH)
If you leave, I want to know if you leave
Mommy, when you want, whenever you want, Yeh, Yeh

[Chorus]
Go, EH-EH-EH
No one is holding you and the door is open, huh
Don't worry about `` of ``, our story is already dead
I hope you are happy and have fun, huh
But here don't come back, don't-no-no
Go, EH-EH-EH
No one is holding you and the door is open, huh
Don't worry about `` of ``, our story is already dead
I hope you are happy and have fun, huh
But here don't come back, don't-no-no
[Verse]
Hey, tell me, what do you expect?
Baby, I love you, but outside
Ere 'someone inside and another on the outside
And I don't feel anything when you get '
Give me-give me band, huh
In my heart you don't ere 'the one who commands
It's over, I don't feel anything for you
No season out of our series'
So go Lejo ', tell the devil to send you the pin
I have not been a team for a long time
Pa'l Cajo our anniversary and Valentine
There is no more Christian Lou or suit them 'in Satén
Follow it, which is green, huh
That is to blame, is what bites you
Stay with the dog, so that I remember you '
And think 'what loses you'

[Bridge]
But I wish you luck, now I'm more 'strong
Grace 'to' what you did to me, huh
You never loved me, huh
I don't know why he insists'
But I wish you luck, now I'm more 'strong
Grace 'to' what you did to me, huh
You never loved me, huh
I don't know why he insists'
