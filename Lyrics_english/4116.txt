I will wait for you Lyrics ["I will wait for you" letter]

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you
We will sit together in front of the sea
And I can walk from your hand
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you
I know that in your eyes there is still love
And your gaze says `` I'll be back '', eh-eh
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you
[Verse 1]
Without knowing about the countdown I think
That although I have not been the same and I confess it
I hope forgiveness is in your mind and I pray you
But although I'm sincere and I promise, you don't look at me
Then you open the door and say, "if you're leaving,"
Rabies consumes me and cry
You walk away and life collapses, without knowing it
I swear, I didn't know
And having known another luck would be
September four, my phrase "If you leave you do not return" pursues me
And I feel like calling you, but you don't answer
I don't understand why you don't answer
If we have fought everything continues
September seven the call that would come
They tell me that you are there, not to call the police, then hang
I still don't lose faith, and I know you'll once come back
And whatever happens

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you
We will sit together in front of the sea
And I can walk from your hand
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you
I know that in your eyes there is still love
And your gaze says `` I'll be back ''
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you

I feel that they took me a piece of my soul
If you leave there is nothing left, there is a lifeless heart
That as a result of your departure he was screaming alone, but half a voice
I feel that life leaves because I'm not with you
I feel that my moon is no longer if your love is not
Neither life nor all sea water
You can turn off all the love you taught me to feel
Without you I'm going to die alone if you come back I want to wake up
Because far, my hand does not serve to walk
I just hope that someday you can escape

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you
We will sit together in front of the sea
And I can walk from your hand
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you
I know that in your eyes there is still love
And your gaze says `` I'll be back ''
And although my whole life passes, I will wait for you

[Bridge]
If you leave there
I'm still singing with the light off
Because the war took me your gaze
(And although I spend my whole life I will wait for you)
If you leave there
I'm still singing with the light off
Because the war took me your gaze
And although I spend my life I will wait for you
Cali and the Dandee

[Bridge]
If you leave there
I'm still singing with the light off
Because the war took me your gaze, Yeh
And although I spend my life I will wait for you
If you leave there
I'm still singing with the light off
Because the war took me your gaze
And although I spend my whole life I will wait for you4embed
