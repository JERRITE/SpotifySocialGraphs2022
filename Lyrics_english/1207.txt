TranslationsPortuguêsMiss Movin’ On Lyrics[Verse 1: Camila, Lauren]
I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm comin' alive

[Chorus: Camila, Lauren]
I'll never be that girl again, no-woah-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-woah-oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So, call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on
[Post-Chorus: Lauren, Normani]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Miss movin' on
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lauren, Normani, Dinah]
I broke the glass that surrounded me (Surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (Remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile, but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side (The other side)
My whole world was electrified (Electrified)
Now, I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day (Independence Day)

[Chorus: Camila, Dinah, Lauren]
I'll never be that girl again, no-woah-oh
I'll never be that girl again (Again), no-woah-oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So, call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on

[Bridge: Dinah]
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was (The way it was)
I'm finding out who I am, and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough (Is gonna be enough)
It's gonna be enough

My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So, call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on (Movin' on)

[Post-Chorus: Lauren, Ally, Camila, Normani]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Miss movin' on (On and on and on and on and on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Miss movin' on (On and on and on and on, on and on and on and on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (Hey, yeah, yeah)
