Lighthouse Lyrics[Verse 1]
Leave a light on in the wild
Cause I'm coming in a little blind
Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
Shining a little light to bring us back home

[Verse 2]
Went to find you in the backyard
Hiding behind our busy lives
Dreaming of a light house in the woods
To help us get back into the world
[Verse 3]
Cause I know, I've seen you before
Won't you shine
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
A little light
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
On us now

[Verse 4]
Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard
Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard

[Outro]
