Youâ€™re the One That I Want Lyrics[Verse 1: Danny]
I got chills, they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying!

[Pre-Chorus: Sandy & Danny]
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart, I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do
[Chorus: Danny & Sandy (Cast)]
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need (One I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes indeed)

[Verse 2: Sandy]
If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your way

[Pre-Chorus: Danny & Sandy]
I better shape up, cause you need a man
I need a man who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up if I'm gonna prove
You better prove that my faith is justified
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside [Both]

[Chorus: Danny & Sandy (Cast)]
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need (One I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes indeed)
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need (One I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes indeed)
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need (One I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes indeed)You might also like5Embed
