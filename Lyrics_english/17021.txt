Blue Mariposa (Acoustic Version) Lyricsquisquis would come to visit me
Tell me if it is with permission or so nomas
I would like to bring me time to give away
Because nobody knows when he leaves

I would like you to come to visit
And see you even just a little more little
Come soon to listen to the song
I composed because I feel you in my heart

Since you left
Since you're not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere
Since you left
Since you're not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere
I would like you to come to visit
Bring me the friends you have done there
You tell me those stories, your jokes and your memoirs
How much have needed and make me cry

Since you left
Since you're not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere
Since you left
Since you're not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere

And I still don't understand why he chose you
It will be that someone who makes him laugh
Sure already realized that you loved more than the account
And he wanted to take a party that does not have a fine
And he wanted to take a party that does not have a fine, oho
He wanted to take a party that does not have a fine

Since you left
Since you're not, not not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere
Since you left
Since you're not
A butterfly
Fly flies flies
You might also like that you left
Since you're not
A blue butterfly
Fly everywhere
Since you left, you left
Since you're not, not not
A blue butterfly
Fly in everything
