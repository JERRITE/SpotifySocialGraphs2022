The Best Thing (That Never Happened) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I let you get away with thinking you’re the cure
I think I’m in too deep, it’s time to pull the cord
You like me more when you think I’m getting bored
I hope you’re home the day I tear down the walls

[Chorus]
I won’t settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain’t nothin’ but a prick
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya
Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life’s too short, I can’t fake it anymore
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya
[Verse 2]
Don’t you get sick of only hearing your own voice?
Talk like you’re so damn tough but you’re just a little boy
You like to think you broke the mold
But now I’m sure you’ll crack just like the rest
When I break your fucking jaw

[Chorus]
I won’t settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain’t nothin’ but a prick
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya
Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life’s too short, I can’t fake it anymore
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya

[Bridge]
I won't settle
I won't settle
I won't settle

[Chorus]
I won’t settle, settle, settle
You are never gonna hold me down
So toxic, you ain’t nothin’ but a prick
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya
Never, never, never
You are never gonna live this down
Life’s too short, I can’t fake it anymore
I’m the best thing that never happened to ya
