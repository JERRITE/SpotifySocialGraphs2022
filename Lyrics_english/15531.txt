Paname boss lyrics [Paname boss "words" ft. Niro, Fababy, Canardo, Sultan, Youssoupha & Sniper]

[Verse 1: La Fouine]
Here is the new Scud missile, brother, I'm the boss from north to south
Your discs don't sell: make covers of my tubes
Four times I ended up in jail, I never had a good fog
My little ones go on radio, your big ones confess
Tement-spa 'in Miami because I do concerts there
But I get investing in the bled because I have family there
Drug trafficking on my criminal record
Nique his mother the commissioner and his wages of misery
I have different girls with different mothers
And as I have lots of a hundred tickets: they call me "Green Father"
I hear this clash on you everywhere on the airwaves
But as a call to the mosque: you can't answer
Keufs control: Nique your mother, I don't have my papers
Accused, you, only in the gym that you have a locker
In Paname all the michtons will tell you, my brother:
It's not just tobacco that we scratch a millionaire!
That the sept-eight witnesses me: I am not a wealthy family
I'm more burnt than a braised chicken: Go fuck!
Abusive control, I baise the state without condoms
My rebeux find it enjoyable ...
[Refrain: La Fouine]
You can see me at the bottom of the box, bottle of field's
I put the rap on all fours, welcome to the dance floor
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
You can see me at the bottom of the box, Rolex in gold
The hatefuls speak badly because they stayed outside
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)

[Verse 2: sniper]
Slut! Number one at the top, you were not even installed
You were good at scratching cigarettes, I'm going to teach you to talk well
That you fall, dirty fiotte, I'm going to retweet by all your team
You existed a'-p, we were double platinum disc
I turn on a candle because tonight we slam astronomical sums
Admit that it is a virgin (buffoon!) Only on your astrological sign
Too often those who have a life of clebs become bandits
Indeed, better a son in Hebs than a mother who begs
We are ready to wage war, everyone on the ground
Make the iron talk, a piece of metal on the lumbar
S.N.I.P. Boss of Paname!

[Verse 3: niro]
N.I.R.O. Street heavy, in Paname we are the big boss
Tell MC's to remove their mouth from the cock to Rick Ross
Request the street which controls the fucking network
We know where the real sums are
We know who are the real men
Click, click instead of criticizing, making biffs, it's not complicated
I baise the game without doing it on purpose like when I get with your lighter
Put them all on the fucking studded passage, I go all the shoots
There are some who are made to be seen: I am done to be listened to
Who can stay with having my featuring skin?
With each fight, I'm the last to get out of the ring
Like a Tron-Pin, I'm not mistaken, I'm just killing
Completely stupid who wants to the spot my marbles?
I'm the best, they know it, I'm not a purist bid
Supported by the Braves, I saw letters from Fleury
Ghetto soldier, faith, madness and fury
Fouiny Baby, N.I.R.O Zeubi
You might also like [Refrain: La Fouine]
You can see me at the bottom of the box, bottle of field's
I put the rap on all fours, welcome to the dance floor
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
You can see me at the bottom of the box, Rolex in gold
The hatefuls speak badly because they stayed outside
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)

[Verse 4: Youssoupha]
La-la-la-la money makes you forget the breed: in Paris
A poor Arab remains an Arab, a rich Arab, it becomes a Qatari
I love the rages, they only do their duty
I offer a rolex to the other MC that they are aware of my glory hour
Swing the bombs and give me the armband
Free the waves and talk about Kinshasa
Do not come and scold us, we are only fish
Do not come and pluck us, we are only passing through
If you fall, avoid tackle
Stroll the condes, avoid the closet
Everyone is sealed, everyone is filled
Everyone is stupid, do the accounts: it's blackout
The last in the arena are the first in chat
Me, I have everything betting on myself like the gypsy in Snatch
I swear on the head of the kids that Congo I teleport
And but coño your style is bof, kinshasa we are the bosses
[Verse 5: ducko]
Zap my fucking verse, you will have more dentist
Listen to my rap of fucked, cracked produced by autistic
I broke my female dog chains, I am walking with my package
Nique his mother the street, the real one, my brother, here there is no internship
Crazy the dawa in the club, you crazy the dawa in a vacuum
We filled rooms, brother, before filling out his flop
I do in humanitarian aid, disabled rap
Cut my tongue and even without it, I'm going to amaze you
'tain, I have too much slab desire to ebb mc
Why challenge us? Not the fool
I'm not in the Comèt ', but in the pepettes
Chehel your TV: Type our heads
Rap tah the slab, we will p't- being a bone
Your rap does not advance, I don't know, do the pods

[Refrain: La Fouine]
You can see me at the bottom of the box, bottle of field's
I put the rap on all fours, welcome to the dance floor
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
You can see me at the bottom of the box, Rolex in gold
The hatefuls speak badly because they stayed outside
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)

[Verse 6: Fababy]
In Paname we are the bosses, we are the stars
Neuf-Trois is cavalating the COPS, where are the Chtars?
Just like all these rappers and firefighters can do nothing
How to build an Empire when you surrounded by eating pupils?
Your revenge marks the crowd, you shot your poto
You have nice speech, we have violent words
Baby-Baby no more, or Baby-Baby give me
No no, love does not make blind, we just fucked you in the dark
Are you in a hassle of platelets? Braque the local grocer
If you are in hassanats' hassle: Braque la nuit du fate
I am the boss of new-three, I have bastard punchlines
I'm the favorite rapper of your big brothers in the closet

[Verse 7: sultan]
Prof of my generation, the others in apprenticeship
Too many girls tell shit, asses replace the faces
What is the point of clasher? I'm as dirty as the Seine
Me, when I send spikes, it does not take me from the sacem
French rap got me drunk, to believe that they are all pockets
I wanted to be a hlel, I have a pig character
Hebs, rap, I did too much
Lift the 'cups and trophies
I have so many hateful on my ribs, you yourself, you know we are listed
They remix like DJs, in bed only know Hosting
I do not give way in my depos' because I darling next door
I tickled my star since I have been targeting the skyscrapers
With us the sorrows are salted: the judge has put her grain of salt

[Refrain: La Fouine]
You can see me at the bottom of the box, bottle of field's
I put the rap on all fours, welcome to the dance floor
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
You can see me at the bottom of the box, Rolex in gold
The hatefuls speak badly because they stayed outside
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the bosses)
In Paname we are the bosses (in paname we are the boss) 14embed
