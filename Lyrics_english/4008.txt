How can I convince you?
I want to have you alone (PRI-BABA-BABAY)
[Choir: Rauw Alejandro & Farruko, both]
What will you do if I tell you my fantasy 'with you?
Whispering to the ear you begin to heat you (PRI-BABA-BABAY)
You tell me 'And we watch'
What 'expected'
If we both like it 'and the eyes cannot deny it?

[Verse 1: Farruko]
(Pu-Pu-Pu-Pum; Farru!)
Since I saw you I knew (PRI-YAH-YAH)
That you were going to be mine (PRI-YAH-YAH)
Something told me (Pu-Pum!)
That you were the baby that wanted so much
Because there was chemistry (woh-oh-oh)
And I saw you so nice (Yeh-EH-EH)
I looked at you so exotic (woh-oh-oh)
How fast for you here, PRI-BABA-BABAY!
And we enjoy, we drank, smoked
We dance to'a the night and at home we end (oh-oh)
I still don't know what's called
And I don't know how we ended up in my bed (Pu-Pu-Pu-Pum!)
But we had chemistry (woh-oh-oh)
And I saw you so nice (Yeh-EH-EH)
I looked at you so exotic (woh-oh-oh)
How fast for you here, PRI-BABA-BABAY!
