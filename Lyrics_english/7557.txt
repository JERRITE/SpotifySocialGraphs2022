I Just Died Lyrics[Verse 1]
Staring in the mirror as I
Start to carefully contemplate
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turned to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange -
Stuttering on every word when you look my way, oh why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye - butterflies
I just died, yeah yeah yeah
[Chorus]
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
Your fingers hush my lips
As I try to explain maybe why you and I
Should hide from such a love affair
My friends think that I'm so insane
To fight this feeling
But my life's at stake
Your embrace, thoughts won't erase
Every hour, minute of the day I'm wit' it, hope and pray
That you might stay
And now you're moving, oh, so closely
Killing me so softly, so softly
I just died

[Chorus]
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
You might also like[Break]

[Chorus]
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight1Embed
