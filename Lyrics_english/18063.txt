Retail Therapy Lyrics[Intro]
(You are now listening to Young Chencs)
(Nastylgia)

[Chorus]
Fly, fly uptown when I'm feelin' down
I wanna do retail therapy (I wanna do retail therapy)
B-been with the gang all week
I need some female energy (Some female energy)
Sucked my soul, I lost my breath
She got me breathin' heavily (She got me breathin' heavily)
Toxic relationship with my queen, but me and the T got chemistry
To-to-told her that I'm a Gemini, now she on Google checkin' the compatibility
She wanna see if I got the agility
She wanna see if I got the ability, huh
I went 'round three, she want round four, she killin' me, huh
ADHD, my trigger finger fidgety
[Verse 1]
My trigger finger fidgetin' (I feel like)
I feel like I need amphetamine
We had the party tun', off the MDMA and ketamine
My-my bro get a box and step on it
Gang make money off rock, Led Zeppelin
One call away from a tent and tape
One call, and they get to steppin' (Get to steppin')
The bando hostile, but if it weren't for the trap house
I'd be popped down
Of course, I would've made an M on tour last year if it weren't for the lockdown
They wanna fuck, now we got the top down
What 'bout when we had the beat-down Honda?
Shoutout FK, I had no sponsor
Most of my team from West, no Thunder

[Chorus]
Fly uptown when I'm feelin' down
I wanna do retail therapy (I wanna do retail therapy), uh
B-been with the gang all week
I need some female energy (Some female energy)
Sucked my soul, I lost my breath
She got me breathin' heavily (She got me breathin' heavily)
Toxic relationship with my queen, but me and the T got chemistry
To-to-told her that I'm a Gemini, now she on Google checkin' the compatibility
She wanna see if I got the agility
She wanna see if I got the ability, huh
I went 'round three, she want round four, she killin' me, huh
ADHD, my trigger finger fidgety

Walk in, walk in wardrobe look like the stockroom
Mum said I'm materialistic
When you're the boss, that shit will cost
I'm buying my mumzy a crib for Christmas
I'm livin' a movie, but it ain't scripted
God is my witness, get out my business
Back in the day, I had one pair of trainers
I wore that shit 'til it gave me blisters, huh
None of my cats had whiskers, G-check that if his face familiar
Went OT and I came back skinnier, Pyrex pot full of white like Nivea
Time zone gettin' annoyin', I'm half asleep and gettin' a call from Australia
Two tour buses, I'm doing up road
One clean, one full up of paraphernalia

[Chorus]
Fly uptown when I'm feelin' down (I wanna do retail therapy)
Uh, b-been with the gang all week (I need some female energy)
Sucked my soul, I lost my breath (She got me breathin' heavily)
Toxic relationship with my queen, but me and the T got chemistry
To-to-told her that I'm a Gemini, now she on Google checkin' the compatibility
She wanna see if I got the agility
She wanna see if I got the ability, huh
I went 'round three, she want round four, she killin' me, huh
ADHD, my trigger finger fidgety
[Outro]
Fly uptown when I'm feelin' down
Fly uptown when I'm feelin' down
I wanna do retail therapy
I wanna do retail therapy7Embed
