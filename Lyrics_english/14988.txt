Caligulove Lyrics[Instrument Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the temple (I was an offering)
Of the heartless (I was an offering)
I was humbled (I was an offering)
And reborn, into a god

[Pre-Chorus]
My dear, sensitive soul is just
A tyrant who enslaves
All those around him
To make certain he
He is hurt, always
[Chorus]
I don't need a reason baby
Put your arms around me
Hold me real close
Clap me in irons
Come on, Caligulove me
Come on, Caligulove me

[Instrument Solo]

[Verse 2]
You can hear it (As an offering)
If you're a good girl (As an offering)
A righteous choir is singing (As an offering)
No, screaming, as they burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, there are no taboos in lust
My veins course blood that's so venomous
When the heartless hears a heartbeat
He's jealous, so jealous

[Chorus]
I don't need a reason, baby
Put your arms around me
Hold me real close
Clap me in irons
Come on, Caligulove me
You might also likeI already gotcha baby
Put yourself upon me
I'm in lust, a slave to desire
When you Caligulove me
Come on
Love me
Hold me real close, love me
Need your Caligulove, girl
Caligulove
