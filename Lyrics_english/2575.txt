Waiting for you lyrics [Intro]
(Goodboy)

[Verse 1]
In the afternoon, the night gradually let go, the raindrops fell into the quiet space
Counseling on dreaming king
Unilaterally remember a muse
The East wind rushed back to bring the floating (woa)

[Pre-chorus]
Thinking that the arid heart wilted will stop sadness
But it is bitter to know "ú oà"
I am just a person coming later
(Hey)
[Chorus]
Knowing I was there nearby
But I will still stand right here and wait for you
Rain storms do not care about day and night
This lovers chose the back to silently miss you, babe

[Verse 2]
Because of passion for eyes, love always lips
Want to tell the whole world only love you
Passionate, ooh-oh, burning on the fire of love
Strong and burned
Baby that's what I feel
My Girl, I'm Waiting For You

A beautiful fresh rose howling I look lovely
Salty legs (OOH)
Gentle fragrance (OOH)
The charming smile, passionate love people

[Pre-chorus]
Thinking that the arid heart wilted will stop sadness
But it is bitter to know "ú oà"
I am just a person coming later
(Hey)

[Chorus]
Knowing I was there nearby
But I will still stand right here and wait for you
Rain storms do not care about day and night
This lovers chose the back to silently miss you, babe
You might also like because you love your eyes, love the lips
Want to tell the whole world only love you
Passionate, ooh-oh, burning on the fire of love
Strong and burned
Baby that's what I feel
My Girl, I'm Waiting For You

[Bridge]
I'm Waiting For You (OH-OH)
I'm Waiting For You (OH-OH)
Wait for me to come here with you, I knit the hand
Warm day of night (y-yeah-eh-eh)

Wait for me to wait for me, yes, wait for me
Wait for me to wait for me, wait until ever?
The sea is dry, the sky is no longer full of stars
Then I still here and wait for you

[Chorus]
Knowing I was there nearby
But I will still stand right here and wait for you
Rain storms do not care about day and night
This lovers chose the back to silently miss you, babe

Because of passion for eyes, love always lips
Want to tell the whole world only love you
Passionate, ooh-oh, burning on the fire of love
Strong and burned
Baby that's what I feel
My Girl, I'm Waiting For You
