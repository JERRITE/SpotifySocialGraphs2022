The Lyrics Carnival [Intro: Baby Rasta]
Gather your body next to mine like this
Just one more night
That you will not forget

I see you dance on the disc
Your body I want to try
You provoke me with a kiss on the mouth
Rozo your body and you ask me more
I can't take it anymore
Your body I want to try
Devour yourself in bed in the morning
Feel your body that makes me bad
[Pre-Caro: Baby Rasta]
Vente mommy ...
I'm dying to see you
With your hot body
It makes me 'crazy to me
Vente mommy ...
I die to see you
With your hot body
It makes me 'crazy to me

[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I want to have you with me
We will travel to the end
Naked in the dark
In intimacy and
I want to have you with me
We will both travel to the end
Devour ourselves in the dark
Think no more

[Verse 1: gringo]
Mommy as gringo nobody will do it to you
Ask me to kiss you
Get mine between the dark
For a alley in the old San Juan
Ask me more, I'm going to give you more
I'm going to whip you as nobody will do it
Vamo 'to end on the seafood
Where I will make love to tropical rhythm

Come for me (come for me)

[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I want to have you with me
We will travel to the end
Naked in the dark
In intimacy and
I want to have you with me
We will both travel to the end
Devour ourselves in the dark
Think no more

[Verse 2: gringo]
Between the beach sand
I'm going to corner you
I'm going to undress you
I will caress you
Your lips kiss
I want to try you
How your body will mix
Come my baby that we are going to give ourselves
I continue the party outside the Carnival
Tonight for you will be special
You will have an adventure that you will not forget
[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I want to have you with me
We will travel to the end
Naked in the dark
In intimacy and
I want to have you with me
The two travel 'until the end
Devour ourselves in the dark
Think no more

[Verse 3: Baby Rasta]
I want to know
If I'm going to forget it tonight
And get you out of my mind I can never
Tell me woman, if my eyes will see you, oh what evil
Your body next to mine
Tell me if you are mine, if tonight it will be repeated
Because time runs and with you I want to be
Tell me if you are mine, because I want to hear it
And satisfy me with your body until the end
Tell me why time goes in this carnival ...

[Outro: Baby Rasta]
