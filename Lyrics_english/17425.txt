Never Alone Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tori Kelly]
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
You might also like[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
Oh, I may have took some time
But now I realize
My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful

[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
There's not a hole too deep
That God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now, heh
Let's go!

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
Can you hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone5Embed
