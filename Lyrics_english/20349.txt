As Above, So Below Lyrics[Intro]
As above-bove, as above (Don't, don't desert me now)
As above-bove, as above (Don't, don't desert me now)

[Verse 1]
I won't lie, it's quite tempting
Your handouts and your bones
I won't lie, they're quite empty
Your promises and your stones

[Pre-Chorus]
If you sell, they'll buy
Don't feel, just sign
If you sell, they'll buy
Don't think, stay blind
(Give me the control)
"Just sign on the dotted line"
(Give me the control)
He whispers softly
(Give me the control)
You're crawling inside my mind
(Give me the control)
"And don't you fight me"
[Chorus]
As above, so below
What you reap is what you sow
What you give comes back threefold
As above, so below
Watch me, watch me float away
I was never yours to save
It all comes back threefold
As above, so below
So below

[Refrain]
As above, as above
As above, as above

[Verse 2]
See, I've danced with the enemy
We have secrets no one knows
Yeah, I've danced with my enemy
I wore her skin and her clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
If I sell, you'll buy
Just feel, just sign
If I sell, you'll buy
Just think, you're mine
(Give me the control)
"Just sign on the dotted line"
(Give me the control)
He whispers softly
(Give me the control)
You're crawling inside my mind
(Give me the control)
"And don't you fight me"

So below
So below

[Refrain]
As above-bove, as above (As above-bove)
As above-bove, as above (Don't, don't desert me now)
As above-bove, as above (As above-bove)
As above-bove, as above (Don't, don't desert me now)

[Chorus]

What you reap is what you sow
What you give comes back threefold

So below
