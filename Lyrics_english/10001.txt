Come with me lyrics [Intro: Bosx1ne, King Badger]
Just you, ExB!

Alright!

[CHORUS: BOSX1NE]
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) baby, want you come with me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
I want you all for me
[Verse 1: Bosx1ne]
Hahaha! Yah! Only!
Baby, I want to be with you, you want to meet
Baby, I want, 'when you laugh more and more
With waking up in the morning you are at the same time
I wish we were just holding hands every day
Then laugh at the same time, we suddenly look up
Do you know, baby girl, you are what I want
Baby girl, I just want more of you
Tell me, if you want me, baby girl, say
You may be able to get along, I want you to feel

[CHORUS: BOSX1NE]
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) baby, want you come with me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) i want you all for me

[Verse 2: Flow G]
So, I'm going to start this
Eh, I'm not used to it
'The type I would have with you
But I can't tell you in front of you
If you only know, it's scary to look at
You look so good, especially close
But hopefully you can tell
And maybe you'll be kissed
In fact, it is your character
I think, as if nothing more
Because the best, you are annoying
You have a beauty, it is frustrating
It's too late, I have my face in my face
Although it is obviously obvious, there is nothing
Bet as well as duck, we should be with you in the room

I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) baby, want you come with me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) i want you all for me

[Verse 3: King Badger]
I want, you just next to
In waking up in the morning, sleep at night
'I will not leave you for a moment, so, baby, come with me
Tara do'n in heaven for us to be happy
Even if you know that it is possible for us to have a problem
But I know that we can deal with everything
Just the two of us are always honest
You just give you excitement and excitement
In the world I am very chaotic
So-capable of fighting and shouting
Everything I can give you
Right now, i just wanna get to know you
So, baby, come my way
Baby, 'don't be shy, get closer
I want you all for me
[CHORUS: BOSX1NE]
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I want you to be next, baby, want you come with me
I want you to see me, I want you all for me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) baby, want you come with me
I WANT YOU JUST (YOU JUST)
(Bae) i want you all for me

I just want to be with you tonight
You be grinding on my body, feeling so damn right (oh-oh)
I want you all for me, baby, no, oh-oh, come next to me, baby
You just want to keep it, i-yeah, i-yeah-eh

Come on, baby, i-yeah, i-yeah-eh, c'mon be closer to me, yeah
Because you just have nothing else to be with
So you can come, baby, it's late, yeah, yeah
