Dawn ', without a boyfriend for not locking up
And I loved his pedicure and the flip flops' Hermès
And if you don't go on the mall, 'tá in the elevator
UPING PA'L APA because I gave you a call
To the 'other' babie 'I put them in Hold
While 'we ate' in the dining room
He doesn't want to smoke, he wants alcohol today
And short heart ', but zero love
I called her, put me cute, says Lindor
I enter the room and call it the sliding door
