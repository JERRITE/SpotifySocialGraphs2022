Pretty Girl Why Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like the ghost of someone dear
She comes to haunt me in my sleep
Still unable to sincerely
Give her heart away for keeps

[Chorus]
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?
[Verse 2]
There she leaves me twice as lonely
As I was but yesterday
Keeping such a hold upon my thoughts
So near yet far away

[Chorus]
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The minstrel boy has gone to war now
Burdened with his father's sword
Still, she doesn't see how she can
Give him peace amidst the horror

[Chorus]
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why not love me?
Pretty girl, why?
Pretty girl, why?You might also likeEmbed
