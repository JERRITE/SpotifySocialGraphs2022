I will be lyricsletra "I will be"
They know your hands
They know your feet
Your eyes know
Also your skin
Who loves you well

So tiny
In a minute
Be
Who knows what
Milagros are made
In an instant
I stop being
And kept in each cell and memory
The desire and love that I put in you

And I will always be
Very close to you
You see me or you will not feel me
In every doubt, in each fear
I'm going to stay, I'm going to beat you
Because you are my peace, my light and my sun
My fever, my strength
My only love
And where always
I am and I will be
In your heart, always there
I will be

I will be

I miss you
So much that
I could die
And I know that you too
What to such people
It becomes eternal
What love
Law is made
You Might Also Likey kept in each cell and memory
The desire and love that I put in you
And it does not reach so much sky, so much glory
And if the day of you

And I will always be
Very close to you
You see me or you will not feel me
In every doubt, in each fear
I'm going to stay, I'm going to beat you
Because you are my peace, my light and my sun
My fever my strength
My only love
And where always
I am and I will be
In your heart, always there
I will be

I will be

I will always be there
I will be
I will always be there

You can change
You can cover
It comes to generate
You lied and lying
You are the part, the part in me
That I never thought was to leave
And look at your hands
And look at your feet
And look at your eyes and tell me who you see
Where I was and I will be
In your heart, I will always be
I will be
