Some Misunderstanding Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's been some misunderstanding
And I'd like to make it right
Both of us need inspiration
And the timing must be right

[Chorus 1]
We all have soul
Yet nobody knows
Just how much it takes to fly
[Verse 2]
But I see my life before me
And I'd like to make a try
Maybe someone knows what fate is
Maybe someone knows just why
All I know is, it's all related
Maybe someone can explain time

[Chorus 2]
But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role
You might be disappointed in the lights
We all need a fix at a time like this
But doesn't it feel good to stay alive

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Now I see that in my visions
That my eyes are seeing twice
Once for every expectation
And once for what I realize

[Chorus 2]
But I know if you sell your soul
To brighten your role
You might be disappointed in the lights
We all need a fix at a time like this
But doesn't it feel good to stay aliveYou might also likeEmbed
