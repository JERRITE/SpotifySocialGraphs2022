City of the Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ohhhhh
Got a bad bitch from the City of the Rose
And she knows, how it goes
She never left the city but she's not local
Shawty we could get together, it's whatever
Just give me the green light
Then we swerving down Marine Drive
Windows open, and your hair blowing
I can hardly focus, can you poke it out for me?
Know what I mean? In those jeans
Tell me, is there really room for me (For me)
In those jeans?
[Bridge]
Tell me do you wanna fuck with a young nigga like myself?
Could you ever fall in love with a young nigga like myself?
And I've been thinking 'bout you, nobody else
And my loving's good for your health

[Chorus]
I really need somebody, tell me you're that somebody
Said I really need somebody, tell me you're that somebody
I really need somebody, need somebody, need somebody
Need somebody
I really need somebody, are you that somebody?
I really need somebody, are you that somebody?

[Verse 2]
Conversation's sometimes overrated
Don't wanna seem impatient but lets get x-rated
No need to wait so long, we've got all night I know
I can hardly focus, can you poke it out for me?
Can I give it to you, show you how you can take it all?
Wanna break you off
Relax and unwind, and let me take my time

[Bridge]
Tell me do you wanna fuck with a young nigga like myself?
Could you ever fall in love with a young nigga like myself?
And I've been thinking 'bout you, nobody else
And my loving's good for your health

I really need somebody, tell me you're that somebody
Said I really need somebody, tell me you're that somebody
I really need somebody, need somebody, need somebody
Need somebody

[Outro]
You think I ain't changed, you said I'm stuck in my ways
I'll just do me and give you your space
I know, I get around, get around, girl that's true
But that never stack to feeling how I feel when I'm with you, no
Cause you're from my city, and that's the City of the Rose8Embed
