Siren Lyrics [Chorus: Ebe Dancel]
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they say I am a beautiful
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they do, my flag will not fall
Drum with water the sprinkle
Huge arms, he was dizzy
Drum with water the sprinkle
With the shortness of breath, you will be bored

[Verse 1: Gloc-9]
Ever since I was a child
You are obvious when playing
So it seems like everyone is confused
Nice to chinese garter and piko
My lips are crimson
In the bubble gum that is coated
Walk around in front of the mirror
Self -telling "What are they doing?"
As the beard twisted
Earrings that are giggling
With the powder purchased with Aling Bebang
To interrupt the bruises on the face
From my father who seemed to be unlucky
As I look at it, I am always confused
Over time I am not aware
That instead of hardening it seems to soften
My heart is lovingly like curly
[Chorus: Ebe Dancel]
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they say I am a beautiful
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they do, my flag will not fall
Drum with water the sprinkle
Huge arms, he was dizzy
Drum with water the sprinkle
With the shortness of breath, you will be bored

[Verse 2: Gloc-9]
Until I became a young man
Wait a minute, this is a girl
But why does it seem like everyone is still confused
What are your problems?
Is it because my actions are different
In what your eye should see
Whenever watching the league, it is always funny
Even though the ball didn't come in, I was so excited
Even if it is in courage because it is just that
I spank the pipe even with stainless
"That's right, Dad, I'm not a rebel
'I'm not going to wear Mom's old fun "
When I'm crying rushes into mist
I just think that I might be adopted
Because every day it is relentless
What my beautiful bottom of the sea is
You might also like [Chorus: Ebe Dancel]
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they say I am a beautiful
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they do my flag will not fall
Drum with water the sprinkle
Huge arms, he was dizzy
Drum with water the sprinkle
With the shortness of breath, you will be bored

[Verse 3: Gloc-9]
Years passed, marrying
My brothers and sisters, they all go with
Away from the distance
"I'll eat it, dad, it's ready for the table"
Ate-to-walk, one step by step
Now the former body is bone and skin
"So on your birthday, I will try to replace
The sadness feels, 'let's not go back "
Although somewhat annoyed not because of the cancer
Because because your guardian is duster
One night, you have called me, come near
I will be with you as you stand, cling to
You in my hand even when it is hard to speak
"Son, forgive everything I have done"
'Not measuring the courage and the mustache on the face
Because sometimes the boys are more than a man
[Outro: Ebe Dancel]
Drum with water the sprinkle
Huge arms, he was dizzy
Drum with water the sprinkle
With the shortness of breath, you will be bored
I'm a mermaid
Whatever they do, my flag is not to be knocked out3embed
