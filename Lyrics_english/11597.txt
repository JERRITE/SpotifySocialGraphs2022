Feel It All The Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a truck out in the drive
And it made me a hundred thousand miles
And it still runs good, yeah, she gets the job done
Drinkin’ regular from the gasoline pump

[Verse 2]
And I’ve got a heart that beats too fast
And a shake in my hands and a pain in my back
And I’m just twenty-two going on twenty-three
Already worn down from everything
[Chorus]
So I wanna drive out for where the sun shines
Drown out the noise and the way I feel
But even the light is so temporary
And I see the dark at the back of my heels
I feel it all the time

[Verse 3]
We’re waking up from these headache dreams
Where I can’t see past what’s in front of me
I was wondering if it could mean something
Or if it’s nonsense like everything else

[Verse 4]
Maybe the days are just running out
Like gasoline gauges as I'm drivin’ south
Oh, I hope that my knees would keep dragging me on
But they’ve been worn down to the bone

[Chorus]
So I wanna drive out where the sun shines
Drown out the noise and the way I feel
But even the light is so temporary
And I see the dark at the back of my heels
But I’m going to drive till I’m in swallowed in sunset
And let me collapse like a broken lung
‘Cause I’m gaspin’ for air, but I don’t feel nothin’
I’m closin’ my eyes till the tunnel's gone
I feel it all the time
You might also like[Outro]
I got a truck out in the drive
And it made me a hundred thousand miles
And I don’t think I’ll ever make it so far
It makes me sad if I think too hardEmbed
