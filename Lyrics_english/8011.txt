Lame Shit II Lyrics [The lyrics "Lame Shit II"]

[Intro]
Moronic
Hey Hey hey!
Moronic, hey!
(Bih!) Hey, hey, hey!

[Updaines]
Tupak bit me
Now I'm sick with this shit
Shaking asshole, bae, like ding-don
Joint hisses, the hut jumps upside down
You, lines in foam, cries, roar
Continuous disaster
Flame of a hundred bonfires to the roots
Third Eye of God Blok
[Chorus]
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance

[Verse 1]
Tupak bit me
Now I'm sick with this shit
Shaking asshole, bae, like ding-don
Joint hisses, the hut jumps upside down
You, lines in foam, cries, roar
Continuous disaster
Like a waterfall, its roar and rod
Bell battle, Baby, pray to God
Took reins, pull tight, watch
Reading, like a locomotive, rushes
Nuclear drip - stupidly Chen In, and
Rhyme-gasoline, chirk-chirk match, and
You, Gori-gori is clear not to go out
It seemed to be baked in the club, the lines seem to be oil
Micro like Tec-9, move fuck fast
Rap-game died, call me a medicine, Bust Down
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
Invariably (Yeah) behind a bookcase
The bump is fluffy, like a haircut Afro, so here
Shaking an ass just as the glasses are shaking in the windows, fuck
Come out of the matrix, you are under the control

[Updaines]
Tupak bit me
Now I'm sick with this shit
Shaking asshole, bae, like ding-don
Joint hisses, the hut jumps upside down
You, lines in foam, cries, roar
Continuous disaster
Flame of a hundred bonfires to the roots
Third Eye of God Blok

[Chorus]
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance
[Verse 2]
Classic, peace - plastic, annoyance
I burn the plastid from dawn to sunset
My lunar tan is a mystery
Hard to hand: it has a salary
Left two -faced ones behind the scenes
The cache fell on the map, I smoke firecracker
Sweeping like a sveg - scenes aroma
I smoke at a time - this is hardening
Pray to me, dock, I am your god
Give a hundred bits - there will be a hundred hits
Squelled ziplok, plus a cool vidok
Gave the current in the lines, and the text is ready
Fucked a mouth of fake friends
Fuck Feim, Baby, I am Lame, hey
Fuck their opinion, forget it
Joint stuck to the fingers, as if glue on it

[Bridge]
PSS, is there Shmal?
Call my path "Soul Train Line"
I smoke jayve day 'n' night
Voodoo Child, Voodoo Child, Voodoo Child
PSS, Fludda - Viper
PSh-Psh, Headshot, Perfect Sniper
Young mathematician
I mind

[Updaines]
Tupak bit me
Now I'm sick with this shit
Shaking asshole, bae, like ding-don
Joint hisses, the hut jumps upside down
You, lines in foam, cries, roar
Continuous disaster
Flame of a hundred bonfires to the roots
Third Eye of God Blok

[Chorus]
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance
It is moronic as the world
YOU, Fludda - Fakir
I smoke three
To knock out the brains
Industry in pieces
Glam Boeviki
Kusni my skill
Try, take a chance18embed
