Sleeping with a Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies 'til we’re one

[Pre-Chorus]
And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah, this is trouble
[Chorus]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart's gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh, we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend

[Verse 2]
All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something 'bout the strangers and the noise

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And why leave when I got you, baby?
It's a risk, but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you'd be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble
Hey, we’re in trouble

[Chorus]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart's gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend

We are both young, hot-blooded people
We don’t wanna die alone
Two become one, it could be lethal
Sleeping with a friend

[Break]
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends (Oh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
You got me in the mood, mood (Mood)
I'm scared, if my heart's gonna break (Heart's gonna break)
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh, we're in danger
Sleeping with a friend (All my friends)
Sleeping with a friend (All my friends)
If my heart's gonna break (Heart's gonna break)
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh, we're in danger
