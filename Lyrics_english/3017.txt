[Intro]
Oh, oh, eh, eh
Kamu no yo oregamasu
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Verse 1]
Open your eyes, kid, look at how we cut the beuh (we cut the weed)
Two-two in the pooch of twenty and resells to C'lui who wants it (for the ients-cli)
I dragged too much at the bottom (dragged at the bottom), in the snow, in the rain (when it curdles)
And for Graille my part, I am not going to ordered you the worst
Three in Cess traffic (Cess) and in showcase, in the Viano, six (six)
I get sucked, I forget all my worries and I am drunk when I count the dirty (dirty) money
I signed, I brought back a bunch of sorrel (from biff), so much sorrel that I attract the evil eye (the puff)
To what, I changed (changed), you know the rest (the rest)
The real ones follow me and the false friends jump (free)
[Bridge 1]
Yeah, yeah, renowned to have the best kush
Now that I have more cash, I go to the bank to cash checks (checks)
With each song, I shock them (I shock them), I had to face life
I am beaten, debated, always worn my balls as Cheick did

[Verse 2]
I advance with hindsight (hindsight), so much cool trends (cool)
I fuck her, I fuck her and I kill (I kill), it may be any (which)
And you don't venture, it's cooked (it's dead), the one trying, we bugger him
And branches anyone, there is 6.35, AK 7.4
Still in the Bendo, it was not the PPE-RA that made us (no)
We have detailed and redirect, you need the gold disc or we redone it
She likes when I get her buttocks, smiles when I sake up on her face (her face)
She wants the fingering when she got it (sucks) and I have the room after six hours (eh, eh)

[Bridge 2]
We recover it around three hours (three hours), we will sleep at four o'clock (four o'clock)
We detail it around ten o'clock, eleven hours forty, we give everything to the hardworkers (to the hardwood)
We recover it around three hours (three hours), we will sleep at four o'clock (four o'clock)
We detail it around ten o'clock, eleven hours forty, we give everything to the hardworkers (to the hardwood)

[Chorus]
I'm still in binks, you know (you know), I'm still in binks, you know (you know)
I'm still in binks, you know (you know), koba of 7, you know (you know)
I'm still in binks, you know (you know), I'm still in binks, you know (you know)
I'm still in binks, you know (you know), koba of 7, you know (you know)
