[Verse 1]
Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that
She Said, "You Know Me Well"
I Seen You and Little Steven and Joanna
'Round The Back of My Hotel, Oh Yeah
Someone Said you was asking after me
But i know you best as blagger
I Said, "Tell Me Your Name, Is It Sweet?"
She Said, "My Boy, It's Dagger", Oh Yeah
[Chorus]
I was good, she was hot, stealin 'everything she got
I was Bold, She was Over the Worst of It
Gave Gear me; Thank You, Dear, Bring Your Sister Over Here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

And i shall dance for little steven and joanna

Chelsea, Chelsea, I Believe
That when you're Dancing Slowly, Sucking Your Sleeve
The Boys Get Lonely After You Leave
It's One for the Dagger and Another for the One You Believe
CHELSEA, I BELIEVE
That when you're Dancing Slowly, Sucking Your Sleeve
The Boys Get Lonely After You Leave
It's One for the Dagger, Another for the One You Believe
