I’ll Probably Never Be Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wonder if this is enough
Or if we’ll ever have what we want
Let’s dress up like those old movie stars
Fading in the spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it good enough
If I keep pretending
This could all be different?
[Chorus]
I know it’s simple
I’ll probably never be
Somebody, somebody
But is it so wrong
To want you to hold me like I’m
Somebody, like I’m somebody

[Verse 2]
It feels like these words just get lost
When you don’t have a voice loud enough
I don’t know if my lungs would survive
And so I sit in silence

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it good enough
If I keep pretending
This could all be different?

[Chorus]
I know it’s simple
I’ll probably never be
Somebody, not anybody
And if it’s all good
I want you to hold me like I’m
Somebody, like I’m somebody
