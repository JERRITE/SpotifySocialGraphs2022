Sad Sad Sad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Too many restless nights, my body's shaking
My head hurts, got a stomachache
Too many sleepless nights and I'm impatient
Like a war inside my mind
I'm anxious all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake laughing, but I'm breaking
Pretend I'm doing fine
Fight with my medication
[Chorus]
It's been a year
Too numb to feel
Twenty milligrams of happiness, but when I do the math
It doesn't add up, it doesn't add up
'Cause I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad

[Verse 2]
Too many hours staring at the television
My therapist says it's okay to rest
My friends are talking and I'm barely listening
They call me selfless, but I'm self-obsessed

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake laughing, but I'm breaking
Prеtend I'm doing fine
Fight with my medication

[Chorus]
It's been a yеar
Too numb to feel
Twenty milligrams of happiness, but when I do the math
It doesn't add up, it doesn't add up
'Cause I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad

Sometimes, I still have good dreams at night
Do my best to wake up smiling
And it's been the best year of my life
But it doesn't add up, it doesn't add up 'cause

[Chorus]
It's been a year
Starting to feel
Twenty milligrams of happiness, but when I do the math
It doesn't add up, it doesn't add up
'Cause I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sad

[Outro]
I'm still sad, sad, sad, sad, sadEmbed
