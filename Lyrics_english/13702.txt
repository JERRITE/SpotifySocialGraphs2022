Summer Jams LyricsI’ve been feeling subjective
Like the heat’s turned my head
In some long daydream sequence
Involving islands and sand

I’m running away
I’m leaving today

Senses come back slowly
Through a terrible wall
Every mile we head southward
My blood starts to warm
I’m feeling okay
As long as we’re leaving today

Don’t you want a seat at the table
Don’t you want to roll those dice
Let’s get lost in another country
Let’s get lost before our feelings slide

You were the Joe that I wanted to go
Toe to toe on the floor
As we rolled Mexico
You can rent me a burro we’ll live off of churros
Let’s freak like we’re pharaohs
I’ll be your sparrow tonight

Ride in a Jeep that we rented for cheap
You can act like a chief sixty pesos a week
It can’t last for long but I’ll sing you a song
You can hear it go on as the sun is beginning to fade

You were the man in whose elegant hands
I felt sweet summer jams
Running through my expanses
Life may be sweet but it’s short as a tweet
So you better dig deep
Give to me all that you canYou might also likeEmbed
