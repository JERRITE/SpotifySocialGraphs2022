[Chorus]
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)

Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing (Nothing)
[Verse 1]
Typical ain't hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I wanna do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)
You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know

Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
