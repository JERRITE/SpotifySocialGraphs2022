Mud perhaps (live) lyrics ["mud letter perhaps (live)"] 

 If I don't sing what I feel 
 I'm going to die inside 
 I have to shout the winds until I burst 
 Even if it is only time in my place 
 If I want my soul touched 
 Well, my flesh is nothing 
 I have to merge my rest with the awakening 
 Even if my mouth is rotting for silence 
 I'm already wanting it 
 I'm already becoming 
 Song mud maybe ... 
 And this is my crust 
 Where the ax will hit 
 Where the river will dry to shut up 
 I already hurry the moments 
 My temple is a lament 
 My brain spits the end of the history 
 Of the beginning that perhaps will resume 
 If I want my soul touched 
 Well, my flesh is nothing 
 I have to merge my rest with the awakening 
 Even if my mouth is rotting for silence 
 I'm already wanting it 
 I'm already coming back 
 Mud maybe ... 
 And this is my crust 
 Where the ax will hit 
 Where the river will dry for Callyou Might Also Likeembed
