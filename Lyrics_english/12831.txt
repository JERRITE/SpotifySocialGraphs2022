Painkiller lyrics [lyrics "Painkiller"]

[Verse 1: jeembo]
Better don't touch me, you can't change this pain
You need to hush it into a fucking zero
On the wounds salt and I drink the wheel, and I lose myself without losing my face
Nine hundred depth, Bae
What's on your mind? I have a flame in my jamb
This is blood on the arm, my room in a kaleidoscope of lights, I'm at zero (What)
Molly road, I pour lemonade past my mouth
Where there is no pain, I know the place and I need to go there
I'm at the bottom, I have ice water over me (water)
I recharge Tommy, I scream in pain, standing in a river of blood
New LEVEL, Doggi, these bitches are strange, like circles on the field
[Verse 2: TVTH]
Heat in the palm of your hand, don't touch me
Alert
Bubbles to the will, like birds to God
We will all be there, Bitch, I Hate Being Sober
The world is beautiful - as if drawn
Shawty breathes, sprinkling with juice
In my heart colitis, I scream in pain
My dogs are strange, like circles on the field
My trunk smeared with the smell of other people's lips
I am looking for morphine with my eyes, so you need to fall asleep
Bitch, these perfumes will not wait for my torment
Yes, I'm in the body of Max Pane - I spray at once from two hands
Okay, I'm sick and so good for me
Bae, I will kill anyone - just give me a reason
He says that rude, I will tell you fuck
I live dear from love to the grave
