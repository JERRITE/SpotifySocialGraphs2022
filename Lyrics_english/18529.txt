Sacrificial Lyrics[Verse 1]
Only in the dark, I
See it in a true light
Baby, you could be my downfall
End of my life
If they're sayin' it's not right
Maybe I don't see it, maybe I'm blind
We made a deal with the devil
But we're doin' fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it all the time
The heavy weight of your love
I'd put it on the line
I would give it up
[Chorus]
Like, ooh, now
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, ooh, now
Babe, you're worth the pain, worth the sacrifice

[Drop]
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial

[Verse 2]
I think it's a sure sign
We should be rollin' with the divine
Maybe we could reach the heavеns
Or dance in hellfire
And if thеy say it's not right
I don't wanna see it, wanna stay blind
'Cause you feel like an angel
And we're doin' fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it all the time
The heavy weight of your love
I'd put it on the line
I would give it right up

[Chorus]
Like, ooh, now
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, ooh, now
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, ooh, now (Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial)
(Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial)
Babe, you're worth the pain, worth the sacrifice
You might also like[Drop]
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, ooh, now
Like, ooh, now
Babe, you're worth the pain, worth the sacrifice

[Outro]
Babe, you're worth the pain, worth the sacrifice3Embed
