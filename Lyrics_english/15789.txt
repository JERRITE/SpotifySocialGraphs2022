Go and see Lyrics [lyrics by "go and see what I doubt"]

(Go and go)
And get with that one that I saw the other day
That you swear that he is all joy
I don't believe it, you do it for jealousy
Teach me that it is real, and the past we will erase
(Go and go)
Try to feel the same, that you and I had
And the love we share, you are full of illusions, nothing more wants to spend time and hide your emotions
(Go and go)
With that one you have healthier
Repentant you will be in the morning
You will miss my caresses
And you will realize that they are only your fantasies
(Go and go)
And give your body if you want
But there is a little detail that I want you to consider
When you are happy and try to forget
In everything you do, you will imagine me
But I doubt it
Why have you sometimes cried with a kiss
Crying with joy and not fear
And I doubt that it will happen to you with him
The same with him

I just read your letter and destroy me
You presume me that you already have something else
Another man who knows how to understand
And you feel like a great woman
(Go and go)
Go with him because he awaits you
How cute the two have to be seen as spring but I doubt it, and that is sure
Why time is hard
(Go and go)
Tell him again
What with me you felt, floating among the clouds
It is not to show you anything
You told me with each look
(Go and go)
Tell me I'm surprised
Why do you turn off your feelings like matches
How simple was all
You asked me what you wanted and had it
(Go and go)
Also tell you that you shouted my name, you felt dying
Now you say you love him
I doubt it, with my heart I swear
You might also I doubt it
Why have you sometimes cried with a kiss
Crying with joy and not fear
And I doubt that it will happen to you with him
The same with him

I doubt it, I don't think that with another you will feel
The same thing you felt with me
Well you know that you even cried me with a kiss
But you know what?
If you want to get you go, but I doubt
(Go and go)
But I want you to know, I don't want you to be raising your hole
Because when you do what you did
You will look for me, but for you you already left
(Go and go)
Goodbye and I wish you good luck
Don't think I tried to stop
I just said what I feel
There you if my words leave them
To the wind
I hope you have even learned
And you know what you had with me
It was done as nothing (Caray)
I was the only present, when you felt abandoned
(Go and go)
Go running tell him that you love him
But with me in your thought
The good thing is that men do not say
But with so much love, the two are consent
But I doubt it
Why have you sometimes cried with a kiss
Crying with joy and not fear
And I doubt that it will happen to you with him
The same with him
(Go and go) ... (Go and go) ...

"They had dawned with a headache
For one of the fright of the forest had given them a very rare drink in one of their getaways
I think he named him beer
It can't be, said Francisco
My head
How strange, and what happened last night?
