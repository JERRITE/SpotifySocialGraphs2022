Doxxis lyrics [letter of "doxxis"]

[Intro: Yandel]
Perreo makes you bad
You just went to guayetear
Normal, today it will be formed (UH)

[Chorus: Yandel]
Do you think 'Malota?
Mommy, don't me, I don't laugh 'with my mouth
Of Gucci you look hard
Now you have to see you without clothes
Perreo dose is necessary, a daily
Do you want 'one or wants' varies'?
In the VIP I have a more lonely area
Pa 'that you pass from the line
[Verse 1: yandel]
I already turned on 'a puff, you say' what smokes'
Money Rain, moves it 'and the devil takes her
On the disc is not the same as in the room
Give me a song and I give you without Phantom
Hand 'in the crockery
And the thing gets good
Nor ask if Yandel touches you
You ask for 'sorry, but I later enjoy it to you'
Hand 'in the crockery
And the thing gets good
Nor ask if Yandel touches you
You ask for 'sorry, but I later enjoy it to you'

[Chorus: Yandel]
You, you believe you 'Malota?
Mommy, don't me, I don't laugh 'with my mouth
Of Gucci you look hard
Now you have to see you without clothes
Perreo dose is necessary, a daily
Do you want 'one or wants' varies'?
In the VIP I have a more lonely area
Pa 'that you pass from the line

[Verse 2: Archangel]
Take the curtain, let him down
When I tell you the tragal rhythm
I know you like it, so go up (go up)
Remove yourself and get to the cloud '(Let's Go), Wuh!
Give yourself a cache of this Blunt
Hand up, mind to na 'and pass it by bastard (bastard)
And if you 'tá resolved
Put on active, come, let me look for you (back)
It shows that you are Sata and you are loose (loose)
And that has' more monster than Delta (Delta)
She looks like a plane
That ass in the VIP serves as a mattress, Yeah
It shows that no one can with us', no (no)
We are given, it is not 'intrepid
This perreo comes from the neighborhood and yours no (no; eh-eh)
Yeah (Wuh!), Yeah
