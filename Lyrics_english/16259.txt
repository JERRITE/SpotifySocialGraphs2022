Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground) (Immortal Version) Lyrics[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

[Verse 1]
I don't know what's gonna happen to you baby
But I do know that I love ya
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want ya
[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground

Ooh! Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
'Cause you do know that I want ya
I need to do you something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want ya

[Chorus]
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout (Shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Shake it on down
