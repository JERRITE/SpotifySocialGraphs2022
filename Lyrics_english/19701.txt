Long Sun Lyrics[Intro]
"Hey, uhm, I think the term I was looking for was fuckboy. Uh, don't be one."
"Hey Jez, it's Alfredo. Gimme me a call when you get a chance. Later."
"Hey, man. Just wanna check in, man, with you. Uh, see how things are going."
"Uhm, just gimme a call back whenever bro, I wanna kick it before you make that uhh, this move out there. Aight, bro"
Yeah
I thought It'd feel good to be home
I don't know

[Verse 1]
I remember times we would chill at Rebecca's house
And now I come home and everyone's trying to keep me out
I love my hometown but she don't love me back
And now my bed is in a city I don't want it at
[Pre-Chorus]
In a desert, does your heart beat louder?
Driving through the desert, are you thinking 'bout her?
('Bout her)

[Chorus]
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to keep it all together
In the hands that made us killers
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to run away forever
Burn out, we burn together
In the long sun

[Verse 2]
A thousand dollars ain't nothing to what it meant before
A thousand homies that I knew that I don't know no more
A thousand jokes that were said about me, I know that fake shit
I just want Thousand Oaks to be proud your boy has made it
This crazy ain't it?
We used to be up on Wendy wasted
You never thought we'd make it here huh? you should face it
I'm Jezzy, baby, the same one that I have always been
I'm coming home soon, so open up and let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
In a desert, is the silence louder?
Driving through the desert, does the wind speak 'bout her?
('Bout her)

Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to keep it all together
In the hands that made us killers
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to run away forever
Burn out, we burn together

[Verse 3]
They say, "You don't really come around, Jezzy, you don't talk to us
And you don't even stop in anymore
You don't chop with us
The fuck you think you are now?
Your stories ain't that beautiful
People die from home
We ain't see you at the funeral
Those parties must be good, dawg
Drugs must be perfect
Your life must be great
Man, I hope it's all worth it
Those people that you call your friends seem really cool and famous
I can motherfucking tell that you forgot what my name is"
I'm like, "Guys you don't get it, it's really complicated
I'm sorry I've been distant, I'm just working here to make it
It's been really hard away on the road in desert dust
And I know you don't believe me
But I miss you all so much"
I'm in aâ€”
[Chorus]
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to keep it all together
In the hands that made us killers
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to run away forever
Burn out, we burn together

[Outro]
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to keep it all together
In the hands that made us killers
Long sun, harsh night in the long sun
We try to run away forever
Burn out, we burn together
In the long sun4Embed
