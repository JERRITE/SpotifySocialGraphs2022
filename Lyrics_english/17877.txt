If I Want You Lyrics[Verse 1: DDG]
Slidin' down Doheney, stayin' lowkey
You know you was in town, you should've told me
We was talkin' everyday, but I got cold feet
You hate me how I am, you miss the old me
Been in and out the city, makin' plays
So busy, losin' track of time, and mixin' up my days
I call you when I'm lonely, I come over, never stay
You sellin' me intention, but I'm cheap, I never pay

[Chorus: DDG, DDG & Halle Bailey]
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, yeah, uh
Baby, don't tease, slide, deep, 'tween
If I want you, yeah
Eight degrees in the 'Falls, then your heart froze
You so out of reach, and you doin' the most
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: DDG, Halle Bailey & Both]
Still haven't found one girl that I need
I wanna take it slow, but all she wanna do is speed (Speed)
She want a follow back, I told her, no, I like to lead
I'm touchin' you in person, I don't need you on my feed
Childish, you so childish, I like wild shit
I like hot girls, I don't want no mild shit
From the highlight room to my houses

[Chorus: DDG, Halle Bailey & Both]
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, yeah, uh (If I want you)
Baby, don't tease, slide, deep, 'tween
If I want you, yeah (If I want you)
Eight degrees in the 'Falls, then your heart froze
You so out of reach, and you doin' the most
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: DDG]
Yeah, long nights all alone
I been drownin' in this smoke, took a thirty, way too strong
I can't feel my face no more, I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want
Yeah, long nights all alone
I been drownin' in this smoke, took a thirty, way too strong
I can't feel my face no more, I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want

You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, yeah, uh
Baby, don't tease, slide, deep, 'tween
If I want you, yeah (You, you)
Eight degrees in the 'Falls, then your heart froze
You so out of reach, and you doin' the most (Most)
You know what it is, bills, trips, tips
If I want you, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeahEmbed
