Reaching Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just another day taken away, back to moonlight
Tired of the same shadows and silhouettes
Before the dawn starts breakin' on the horizon
Once I'm closer to somethin' I don't have yet

[Chorus]
I'll keep reachin' as far as I can till break of day
I'll keep reachin', the light of my life will find it's way
I know if I reach too far I may not ever recover
But I know the stars ain't all I'm meant to discover
So I'll keep reachin'
[Verse 2]
While you're fast asleep counting your sheep, I'm moon breathin'
I'll be up all night playin' through this twilight dream
'Cause all my life I have been patiently waitin'
But lights are dim to fulfill my destiny

[Chorus]
I'll keep reachin' as far as I can till break of day
I'll keep reachin', the light of my life will find it's way
I know if I reach too far I may not ever recover
But I know the stars ain't all I'm meant to discover
So I'll keep reachin'You might also likeEmbed
