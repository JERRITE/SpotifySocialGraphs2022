Shoot My Shot Lyrics[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Imagine me fuckin' you on the sofa
Your body on mine, you gettin' closer
You know I gotta shoot my shot
You know I gotta shoot my shot, yeah
You workin' them legs just like you know some'
Let's go to the club, we need to pour some'
I think I gotta shoot my shot
I think I gotta shoot my shot

[Post-Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Twenty racks bustin' out the jeans
Twenty racks bustin' out the seams
I need a bad bitch up on my team
I need a bad bitch up on my team
So I gotta shoot my shot with you
[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Gotta shoot my shot just like you're 2K
Once I get it poppin', I say touch√©
We can get it poppin' on a Tuesday
We can get it poppin' on a Tuesday
I'm sucking on her neck, she be like, "Ooh, bae"
Tell me your flavor, I'll give you a taste
I come with some dick, I don't come with a raise
One taste of this love, I'ma drive you insane
Gotta shoot my shot, I'm a bad bitch getter
I'm a groovy young nigga with a pocket full of skrilla
Gucci shoes, chinchilla, moonwalking like I'm Thriller
She a good soul, she need a real young nigga, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Imagine me fuckin' you on the sofa
Your body on mine, you gettin' closer
You know I gotta shoot my shot
You know I gotta shoot my shot, yeah
You workin' them legs just like you know some'
Let's go to the club, we need to pour some'
I think I gotta shoot my shot
I think I gotta shoot my shot

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
Said he need a partner and I fit the job description
The ball is in my court, yeah, it's my decision
He said he's tired of the fast livin'
Yeah, he done been through mad women
You know I got my own, no ass kissin'
Big body Benz with a red ribbon
Ballin like Timbs in December
Runnin' up M's with my niggas
At first I used to spend 'em
Country boy, show me how you livin'
I'm from Detroit, you know Eminem?
I used to tell him miss me like Timbaland
Curve ball like killin' 'em
No bodies, these bitches, I'm killin' 'em
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh

Imagine me fuckin' you on the sofa
Your body on mine, you gettin' closer
You know I gotta shoot my shot
You know I gotta shoot my shot, yeah
You workin' them legs just like you know some'
Let's go to the club, we need to pour some'
I think I gotta shoot my shot
I think I gotta shoot my shot

[Post-Chorus: Yung Bleu]
Twenty racks bustin' out the jeans
Twenty racks bustin' out the seams
I need a bad bitch up on my team
I need a bad bitch up on my team
So I gotta shoot my shot with you

[Outro: Yung Bleu]
