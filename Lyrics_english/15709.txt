For loving you like that Lyrics [letter from "by loving you like this"]

[Verse 1]
You will always be the girl who fills my soul
As a restless sea, as a calm sea
Always as far as the horizon (Yeah, Yeah)
Shouting in silence your name on my lips
Only the echo of my disappointment remains
I'm still here in my dreams of following you

[Pre-car]
It will be, it will be as you want but it will be
If I still have to wait seven more lives
I will be hung from this feeling, oh
[Chorus]
For loving You so
That is my fortune, that is my punishment
It will be that so much love is prohibited
I keep here dying for being with you
For loving You so
A step away from your mouth and unable to kiss her
So close to your skin and unable to touch it
Burning wishes with each look

[Post-car]
For loving you like this (for loving you, for loving you, Yeah)
For loving you like this (OH, Yeah)
For loving You

[Verse 2]
So I'm walking on this tightrope
For going behind your trace converted into shadow
Price of love that you denied me one day (Yeah-Yeah, Yeah)
Counting the seconds that go to see you
Making you guilty of my own luck
Dreaming of you awake with making you mine

[Pre-car]
It will be, it will be as you want but it will be
If I still have to wait for you seven more lives
I will be hung from this feeling, oh

For loving You so
That is my fortune, that is my punishment
It will be that so much love is prohibited
I keep here dying for being with you
For loving You so
A step away from your mouth and unable to kiss her
So close to you skin and unable to touch it
Burning wishes with each look

[Post-car]
For loving you like this (for loving you, for loving you, Yeah)
For loving you like this (OH, Yeah)
For loving You

[Outro]
What are we?
CNCO, Baby
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Baby (please, Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah (please)
(Please, Yeah) Embed
