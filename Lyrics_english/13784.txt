Lyrics discretion ["Discretion" letter]]

[Saying]
PA-PA-PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH
PA-PA-PA-PAH, O-O-O-O-O-O-OH

[Verse 1]
Today I see that it is more
To remember again
The remains of what left
No, don't take it bad
I really loved you
But don't make it awake
[Pre-stribe]
Because I still see it in your brown eyes
You still feel that I am your wife
You see me just like yesterday
Because I still see it in your brown eyes
Do not turn off that shine
You see me just like yesterday
I'm no longer your wife

[Chorus]
We promised discretion
With the sensation
I know he left you
My skin in the corner
And you can't take the taste from
Discretion with that passion
For the good of the two
I have you in a drawer
And the only key was lost that day

[Verse 2]
You're going to forget
From far to greet
Leave nostalgia in your room
The smile on the side that killed me
And those cold hands looking for heat
And you don't see me with that face
I know that look well
I know you think about it in silence
My breath in your neck
You Might Also Like [pre-stribe]
Because I still see it in your brown eyes
You still feel that I am your wife
You see me just like yesterday
Because I still see it in your brown eyes
Do not turn off that shine
You see me just like yesterday
I'm no longer your wife

[Chorus]
We promised discretion
With the sensation
I know he left you
My skin in the corner
And you can't take the taste from
Discretion with that passion
For the good of the two
I have you in a drawer
And the only key was lost that day

[Saying]
PA-PA-PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH
PA-PA-PA-PAH, O-O-O-O-O-O-OH
PA-PA-PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH, PA-PAH
PA-PA-PA-PAH, O-O-O-O-O-O-OH
[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Discretion (discretion)
With sensation (with sensation)
I know he left you
My skin in the corner (El Rinc√≥n, O-U-OH)
And you can't take the taste from above (the taste from above)
Discretion with that passion (with that passion)
For the good of the two (of the two)
I have you in a drawer (in a drawer)
And the only key was lost that day

[Outro]
It was lost that day
O-U-O-OH, O-O-U-O-O-O-OH
E-e-e-e, O-O-U-O-O-O-OH
(U-U-U-UH, U-U-U-UH) 1embed
