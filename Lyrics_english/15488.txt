I fall in love with you Lyricsme falling in love with you
There is no way out
Even if you try to flee
You are lost

I fell in love with you
Because I must love you
Because I listen to your voice
All over

It is an instinct
A desire almost
A mania
You will be (you will be)
Chiras or don't want mine
I fell in love with you
Because I can't
Make my obsession away
To be with you

I fell in love with you
Of your whole life
I fell in love with you
Want or not want

It's like a dream
That is repeated
Day to day
You will be (you will be)
Want or don't want mine

I'm a man
Like so many
That follows you, that you spy you
I am a man who asks for Compaia

Chorus

I fell in love with you
My best friend
Because I learn to fly
Always with you
I fell in love with you
Like summer
Because you burn my skin
Hand with hand
You Might Also Likeme Fall in love with you
Although I should not
I fell in love with you
Dammit

I fell in love with you
In every moment
I fell in love with you
And so I'm sorry

Ends choir

It is a desire
A sweet drop of poetry I give you
Totally my joy

It is an instinct
A desire almost a challenge
You will be (you will be)
Want or don't want mine

Choir 2

I fell in love with you
Although I should not
I fell in love with you
Dammit
I fell in love with you
In every moment
I fell in love with you
And so I'm sorry

I fell in love with you
Just as you are
I fall in love even if
That you don't love me

I fell in love with you
You are in my mind
I fell in love with you
Completely

I fell in love with trembed
