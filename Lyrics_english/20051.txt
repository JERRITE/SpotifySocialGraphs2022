[Verse 1: kaktov]
We kill some who believed they were Blessed '(Blessed')
Do not compare to mine because you do not look like
If he is not going to respect me 'he does you' reset (prr)
Pew-Pew-Pew-Pew, pew, I make you 'reset
I have a cold in the refrigerator, I don't speak to me 'for some mese'
Both Beef online, in the neighborhood they bold '
If you don't respect the corner, let me grow
So much play with the devil and still does not appear (PRR)
I have a American voice but Flow Pablo Lescano
I always defend myself, I don't need lawyers (no)
That gil was drowning and not throwing his hand (glu-glu-glu)
Now I live from Music, I don't need grams
Like Jason (Yah, Yah), you calm 'a massacre like Manson (PA-PA-PA)
If I cross you down the street, Double Nelson
I don't think about it, I'm going to the bone
I'm skinny and floe flow (Yah)
I want Dolly ', no more weight
Honey, Honey

I have a rocket, bum-bum-bum, which throws shots
Tickets on the floor that I retire at bank
Envious in the sight, in case they get me out of what (haha, what?)
I have the gorillas that kill, and it is by vice (prr-prr-prr)
My glass has read with two pills that I put (prr)
I took so many drugs that I don't know what to say (no)
I get your girlfriend, but I want to sleep (haha)
So much in my head, you better go out of here (Yah, Yah, hey, baby, it's Nicky Gordo)
Friday 13, bad luck, like all my life
They stop 'they close to me, I can't find the exit
Whore, I'm hitting as if it were AIDS
And without sucking any ass, po 'that all' throw me
Hey, the ass of that rapper 't√° full of saliva
Whore, I don't have an angel, the demon takes care of me
PUTA, I HAVE NIGHT
I think I'm a slayer, 'toy meti'o on paper

[Bridge: Dillom]

That rapper now sleeps with the pece '(glu-glu)

They know I'm winning, Winn 'Eleven (What?)
