If I'm beautiful, I just think about you
Eager to call you and tell you

[Chorus: Alex Rose & Myke Towers]
I want to fuck, give you
Tell me if you don't

Do it without a condom
She likes to mix codeine and oxycodone

[Verse 1: Myke Towers]
Baby, I Wanna Fuck You, like Akon (SI)
You know that I deserve it
She codeine to the soda (yes)
He says that I do it perfect
She became addicted to sex
I mammated it for the express (ah)
When I'm alone, I think about you
I had to get you out of Friendzone
I want to give you day and night
In the room or in the car
And your perfume Dolce stayed in my clothes (ah)
I still remember the poses
She is Freaky, asks me to spose

Addicted to your buttocks like Codeine (Codeine)
I have experienced with others, but I never find
Someone like you with those movements
With you I dared to throw it inside
Like when I put you on the seat
Baby, you are the favorite (favorite)
The only one that makes me come if it shouts (if you shout at me)
I'm already coming to eat you complete
