Leather Face Lyrics[Intro: King Gordy]
Woo! Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: King Gordy]
We get to slicing and stabbing, we got no mask with axes (Leatherface!)
Pu-pu-pull up on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals (Leatherface!)
Eat-eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won’t stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
We eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
I’m the sickest rapper on this fucking Earth
Say my name, I eat your face like fuckin' Lurch
Mentally ill from Amityville with thousand pills (Mentally ill)
Go on your grill, with the steel you get killed (Blow!)
A racist, they hate this, I got the latest (Latest!)
Surviving R. Kelly, I was locked in the fuckin' basement (Aaah!)
Tied up, fired up they choked me up
I was asleep till Joe Budden's woke me up
Outta my mind like Kanye, twist your mouth like Conway
I'm higher than Yahweh, I'd know where y'all stay
Hahahahaha

[Chorus: King Gordy]
We get to slicing and stabbing, we got no mask with axes (Leatherface!)
Pu-pu-pull up on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals (Leatherface!)
Eat-eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won’t stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
We eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we’ll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
I’m sicker with verses, this clip is dispersin', you entering hearses
Then into the church and into the dirt your body will fill up with worms, then
I am psychotic, erotic, bionic, high off the chronic and I don't think logic
And I'm in your closet, I’m hidin' and stalkin' as soon you walk in
I'm carving your heart up, don't start up that cryin', bitch, I'm a monster, your family dyin'
Start wit' your daughter then send her to slaughter, but before I off her, I'm in her vagina (I'm in her vagina!)
I am nothing like Freddy (Freddy!) Baby, I'm much worse than Jason (Jason!)
I'll cut you up with machetes (Machetes!), then I should wear all your faces
'Cause I am just Leatherface, then pray you won't make it safe
But sorry to say you won't get away, but don't be afraid, you won't be okay, well, okay!
Sorry I lied, get inside of the suitcase, chop her fuckin' body, won't find her for two days
I'ma about to pop a molly and go walkin' with two Ks, and shoot your new boo with a cute face

We get to slicing and stabbing, we got no mask with axes (Leatherface!)
Pu-pu-pull up on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals (Leatherface!)
Eat-eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
We eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Listen, it's 11.30 p.m. and you 'bout to fall asleep, and I'm at your window with a mask on (Shh! Huh?)
I proceed to climb in through the dining room with a machete that I'm 'bout to shove into your backbone
Then cut it down into your asshole, I bloody up your fucking bathrobe (Bitch)
And if your wife is awake, and she witnessing what I'm doing, I kill her then I fill her pussy up with tadpoles, yes, I'm that gross ("Oh my god, aah, no, no!" Yeah)
When it rains it pours, especially when my blade is pulled, the deeds paid in full
I'm butt-naked in your neighbors pool, I stay stunting while I'm face-fucking a decapitated skull
You ever seen that before? (No!) Freak nasty gore, I need ass galore so please ask the Lord
For three trashy whores with knee pads, of course, who deep-throat while my balls swing back and forth
I like it like that (Yeah), bitch, don't you try to fight back (No), all you now realizing I have (What?)
A can of lighter fluid, I'ma jam it right into your fucking cleavage area and, damn it, I'ma light match (Mmm)
Leatherface, Leatherface, pulling up on you inside a fucking Chevrolet (Mmm)
And don't you try to run away, I'ma easily cut the chase and probably hit you with a motherfucking hand grenade
Nobody saw my offense, I got corpses hanging in the attic with scars on they ribs
Body parts in the fridge, so pardon the stench, for breakfast, I ate someone's heart with some grits
I don't want cops to barge in my crib, you don't know how retarded I get, I pushed a burning car off a bridge
With a family inside it, I get too excited, with me, there's no bargaining, bitch
Leatherface
[Chorus: King Gordy]
We get to slicing and stabbing, we got no mask with axes (Leatherface!)
Pu-pu-pull up on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals (Leatherface!)
Eat-eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
We eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)

[Verse 4: Lazarus]
People want to label me a slasher, nah, I'm a surgeon, make a facial mask from his fascia
Slice him into parts, dissecting is a art, I calculate the angle of his zygomatic arch
But this is my dilemma, how to rip the bone tissue when I damage the lamella, love the taste of the patella
Add some peanut butter, Nutella, and you got something stellar, as I'm cooking out the Salmonella down inside my cellar
Picking out a chainsaw to cut sternum, do I use the MS 880 or my Husqvarna?
The stomach churner, your guts burn up, but making a new mask is only thing I'm concerned of
That's how Dr Khan do it, like Thomas Brown Hewitt, needle-driver to the epidermis, suture ‘round through it
Compression of the blood vessel, oozing off fluid, poke the eyeballs out the sockets, let my eyes view it
Your face on my body lookin' at your body, you called me nobody, I sawed your whole body
Mop your blood stains with a broom while I am delivering your liver to my living room
Consider no amount of money, or a pot of gold that compares to your heart and lungs sitting on my wall at home
Chewing every bit of collagen inside your collar bone, that's for dinner, for dessert, your brain on my waffle cone

[Chorus: King Gordy]
We get to slicing and stabbing, we got no mask with axes (Leatherface!)
Pu-pu-pull up on your avenue, slaughter your family like animals (Leatherface!)
Eat-eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface! Leatherface!
We eat your body like cannibals, run in the woods, we'll come after you (Leatherface!)
Sorry we won't stop attacking you, trap you and fucking kidnap you, bitch (Leatherface!)5Embed
