Translation -lensing lyrin lyrics [lyrics to "ronin"]

[Part 1: Bushido & Animus]
Yeah! Sonny Black is back and dogs have linen compulsion
Keep this goddamned scene in just one hand
You ask me if I clarify my dispute with these hookers'
But I make it out of beef, as if I were nusret
You are welcome to try whether you get me small
Fuck your junkie label and bring hip-hop into the 90s
Question: What is a cunt in a livestream?
Simply a cunt in a livestream
Fuck 'on high-society, the scene is now being shaved off
Revenge is served so cold that your whole neck freezes
International, fuck 'your angle advocate
Because I break the neck of your syllable acrobat
This is Animus in Beastmode and Sonny Bounct the Flavor
Sleep on the couch, wake up on the major
Greetings to my haters, the envious and the liars
This is CCN4 and enemies become brothers, we are
[Hook: Bushido & Animus]
Ronin, German rap just gets a heart attack
Ronin, I packed my pain in this album
Ronin, they were happy, but we laughed last
Ronin, say who would have thought? Boy, we are
Ronin, German rap just gets a heart attack
Ronin, I packed my pain in this album
Ronin, they were happy, but we laughed last
Ronin, say who would have thought? Boy, we are Ronin

[Part 2: Bushido & Animus]
The hymn on the street for the ghetto kids
Save yourself your techno hits, fuck your reaction clip
Everyone is shocked because this scene has said to be dead
David against Goliath, Hater gave us up
Let them all lie, because only that's how these toys have a chance
Embarrassing when the interviews have more clicks than your songs
Question: What is a cunt that comes with people?
Simply a cunt that comes with people
Will not tolerate me, because for me the principle is
Fans press the repeat button like a weapon of war
Run in with ski mask, people salutier'n
You don't protect me from you, they protect you from me
Better if you understand it: I am too dissented by an own goal
Without us rap is a bunch of shit like the hype awards
Greetings to those who thought a comeback would not be possible
Your kings are dead, long live the king, we are
You Might So Like [Hook: Bushido & Animus]
Ronin, German rap just gets a heart attack
Ronin, I packed my pain in this album
Ronin, they were happy, but we laughed last
Ronin, say who would have thought? Boy, we are
Ronin, German rap just gets a heart attack
Ronin, I packed my pain in this album
Ronin, they were happy, but we laughed last
Ronin, say who would have thought? Boy, we are Ronin6embed
