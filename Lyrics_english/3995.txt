301 lyrics [Verse 1]
Our environment - darkness rules her
I bring them light in the Alan Wake case
A spark will not bend their false fan
After all, my false -fuel is a signal of lights
And who is the quarrel in the game, I don't care, it doesn't matter
I cut the way to the ladies with a signal saber
No medals - you need to pour bronze
There are no tonsils even - I have tonsillitis, uh
You look at the stars, yeah
You see the zenith
While we get tired of a quiet sapa
Grinding every lump of earth, yeah
And I'm here to change everything
Looks forward, because we are predators
You won't find my guys
After all, my guys are all predators
My people are all predators
See the one from whom it blows warm
Because they are not easy to find a snake
And my people are already thousands
And my people will be a million
But strangers climb, you will spray everything with caustic saliva
But if your tongues are so long
Why then am I a chameleon?
LDMA, NIKER and Storm, 2GRUL and JUBILEE, VYU - We are barefoot
And we cannot sit, idle like Furios
I am a handler like Furios
The ideal killer in the game quietly entered
You haven't seen my women yet
They are mares of a non -terrible Joe

301! Man, there are more than 301!
Buddy, we are more than 301! Homie, there are more than 301!
301! 301! White, there are more of us than 301!
Fella, there are more than 301! Bredrin, we are more than 301!
301! 301! Man, there are more than 301!
Buddy, we are more than 301! Homie, there are more than 301!
301! 301! White, there are more of us than 301!
Fella, there are more than 301! 301! 301!

[Verse 2]
He faded more than once, screaming from wounds and pain
But always warmed the hearth of my gang underground
I chose to tear the boxes, they do not hide from Kujo
You can adapt to any environment
But only I'm here yautzha
I am here owl
If you look better
With them we are in different languages, as with the nephew of Scrooj
I change the skins, but not Mizogin
Not about how many girls did and leaked
And let the world be full
But the skins are more often from them than from ... than from Cruella de Vil
But you are not even 101
Of course, I have a different language, because your ulcers is stomatitis
I rise from the bottom, like a stalagmit
I have something to teach you
Start from my texts to make a textbook
There are more than three hundred of us, his mother ... one
Remember, friendly, my people are all predators, my people are yautzha
Bend for the sake of a crowd of applause I am vile
I am changing the masses, not getting up, because I am the best friend
But not Sasha Chest - Yunusova: I killed my first bit at 16
