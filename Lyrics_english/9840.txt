It's a cold night in my bed in the heat of the summer
I've been waitin' patiently for a beautiful lover
He's not a cheater, a believer
He's a warm, warm-blooded achiever
It's a lonely night in my bed in the heat of the summer, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun
But I gotta take that risk tonight
[Chorus: Sam Smith & Demi Lovato]
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (For someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me, for someone to love me

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Oh, yeah
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter
No, I've been lookin' hard for a lover disguised as a sinner
No, not a cheater, a redeemer
He's a cold, cold-blooded defeater
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter, no

[Pre-Chorus: Both & Demi Lovato]
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun (Breaks)
But I gotta take that risk tonight

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (For someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me, for someone to love me, yeah
