Self Aware Lyrics[Chorus: Durand Bernarr, Qveen Herby & Both]
I'm amazing, bitch (Yep), and you know it
I don't have to say shit 'cause I show it (Ah yeah)
You said I think I'm all that well, you thought right
That explains why you dreamin' 'bout me last night (Hey)
I'm amazing, bitch (Bitch), and you know it (And you know it)
I don't have to say shit 'cause I show it ('Cause I show it)
You said I think I'm all that, well, you thought right
That explains why you dreamin' 'bout me last night

[Verse 1: Qveen Herby]
People ask me why I gotta slay? (Gotta slay)
Santa Claus to these bitches, giveaway (Giveaway)
Gas it up for these bitches, Bobby Flay (Bobby Flay)
I got bops lined up like a buffet (Like a buffet)
Self aware, God damn, I'm amazing (Ooh)
Wrote a hit again and it don't even phase me (Ooh)
Improvised it, like I'm Wayne Brady (Ooh)
Whose line? Bitch, it's mine, you can pay me
[Pre-Chorus: Durand Bernarr]
Popping through, fresh off the flight right now
Sleepy-ass nigga tear a nap's ass up
I'ma keep on smokin' while I'm giving you these vocals
Best believe I never left, but the keys stay right

[Chorus: Qveen Herby, Durand Bernarr & Both]
I'm amazing, bitch (Bitch), and you know it (Ayy; and you know it)
I don't have to say shit 'cause I show it (Ayy, and do; 'cause I show it)
You said I think I'm all that, well, you thought right (Right, right)
That explains why you dreamin' 'bout me last night (Last night, night)
I'm amazing, bitch (Bitch), and you know it (And you know it)
I don't have to say shit 'cause I show it ('Cause I show it; bitch, where?)
You said I think I'm all that, well, you thought right (Right)
That explains why you dreamin' 'bout me last night (Sheesh)

[Verse 2: Durand Bernarr]
Singing on key, what you know about?
Oh, you ain't know I was from these parts
(Melodyne is your best friend, baby)
(How you flat and sharp, all up in your gravy?)
Cool as a fan, finer than your man
I'm the freedom that you wish he had
(Only really fuck with sports in slow-mo)
(Dirty nails, dirty dick, no bueno)
