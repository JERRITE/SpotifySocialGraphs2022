Oh Susannah Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every girl is a daughter
But you're not quite the same
You're like fire in the water
And smoke on the rain
You've got a sweet something about ya
Something hard to name
The way your hair falls on your shoulders
It's hard to explain, oh, no

[Chorus]
Oh, Susannah
If ever the world drags you down
Call my name
And I'll come running
I'll sit down beside you
And I won't make a sound
Oh, Susannah
[Verse 2]
I wanna walk down by the water
I wanna stand round there and breathe
I wanna treat it like an altar
With you right there with me, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, Susannah
If ever the world drags you down
Call my name
And I'll come running
I'll sit down beside you
And I won't make a sound
Oh, Susannah

[Bridge]
I have been travelling and I been taking stock
So when I get home there's no need to talk
'Cause I feel we've said
All that there is to say
And even though we're parting ways

[Chorus]
Oh, Susannah
If ever the world drags you down
Call my name
And I'll come running
I'll sit down beside you
And I won't make a sound
Oh, SusannahYou might also likeEmbed
