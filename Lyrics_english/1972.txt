Freak the Freak Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Are you listening? Hear me talk, hear me sing
Open up the door, is it less, is it more?
When you tell me to beware, are you here, are you there?
Is it somethin' I should know? Easy come, easy go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Noddin' your head, don't hear a word I said
I can't communicate, when you wait, don't relate
I try to talk to you, but you never even knew
So what's it gonna be? Tell me, can you hear me?
[Chorus]
I'm so sick of it, your attention deficit
Never listen, never listen
I'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit
Never listen, never listen
I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout, so what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
Patience runnin' thin, runnin' thin, come again
Tell me what I get, opposite, opposite
Show me what is real, if it breaks, does it heal?
Open up your ear, why you think that I'm here?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Keep me in the dark, are you even thinkin' of me?
Is someone else above me? Gotta know, gotta know
What am I gonna do? 'Cause I can't get through to you
So what's it gonna be? Tell me, can you hear me?
(Can you hear me?)

I'm so sick of it, your attention deficit
Never listen, never listen
I'm so sick of it, so I'll throw another fit
Never listen, never listen
I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout, so what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Bridge]
Easy come, easy go (Hey)
Easy come, easy go
(Can you hear me?)

[Chorus]
I scream your name, it always stays the same
I scream and shout, so what I'm gonna do now
Is freak the freak out (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
[Outro]
(Freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out)
I scream your name
(Freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out)
But you never listen
(Freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out)
No, you never listen
(Freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out, freak the freak out)
But you never listen2Embed
