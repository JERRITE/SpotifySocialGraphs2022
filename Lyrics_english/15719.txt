Suddenly Lyrics [Sudden "Letter"]

[Intro]
My guasa is fashionable
Let's see if I have to make a pod 'you boté', you know
Here we are not in commercial shit
My mom is gangster
And I don't know you, but I die for you
'Toy in Malianto, I Feel That Shit Baby

[Chorus]
We always do it different
What you tell me mai, it makes me hot
Mommy, I fell in love with you suddenly
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
Mommy, you and I love each other
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
I fell in love with you suddenly
[Verse 1]
Those richitillos never have drugs
And I am from the street, with me go toa
I brought you gelato, Molly also brought you
My cousins ​​sell parakeet, you know Shorty

[Verse 2]
We do it listening jory
Ma, do not resist me
If you want Malianteo, Kendo Kaponi
You are a drug addict
Mami, you are a magazine model
Leave clothes on the floor
We have to do it mai, do not see yourself
You are going to be absent, without your boyfriend he passes ready
Because you were with the kat kit, you weren't alone

[Verse 3]
If you are fine with him
I no longer have to see
I am the best baby
Your guard number
Pa 'when you have wet
I am the best baby
I'm leaving for the street
(?) Baby and I don't put 'detail
You Might Also Like [verse 4]
You don't want a rich child
You want a street child
You want to get out very rich
You want it to be very rich guaya

[Chorus]
We always do it different
What you tell me MAI MAKES ME HOT
Mommy, I fell in love with you suddenly
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
Mommy, you and I love each other
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
I fell in love with you suddenly

[Verse 5]
Those richitillos never have drugs
Your boyfriend is a cypol
Never fall in love
Your boyfriend is a pigeon
Baby that fucks

[Verse 6]
Coming Back Home
I don't know when I see you again
I need to fuck you
I fell in love 'suddenly
Already coming back home
On the downturn
Mami This is Fucking Sad
A fucking depression
[Bridge]
Fernandito Kit Kat
The mafia of love

[Chorus]
We always do it different
What you tell me mai, it makes me hot
Mommy fell in love with you suddenly
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
Mommy, you and I love each other
All I want is to see you
Ma, I want to give you strong
I fell in love with you suddenly

[Verse 7]
And that those richitillos never have drugs
But I am from the street, with me go toa
I brought you gelato, Molly also brought you
My cousins ​​sell parakeet, you know Shorty

We do it listening jory
Ma 'do not resist me
If you want Malianteo
Kendo Kaponi
You are a drug addict1embed
