Diva (feat. Emilia) Lyrics[Letra de "Diva" ft. Emilia]

[Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like Beyoncé, I feel like Shakira
Lemonade, I'm juicy, hips don't lie, Selena
Britney, Christina, rest in peace Aaliyah
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva

[Verse 1: Princess Nokia]
I'm a popstar, rockstar, bad bitch, go on, call me savage
I'm a top dawg, win 'em all, call the shots, on God, do damage (Yeah)
Iconic, iconic, I got it, I flaunt it, yeah, that's me
Billboard, I'm charting, top dollar, song credit, it's Destiny
Yo, how the hell I get on?
I was feeling like queen takin' hits from a bong
I done went from underground, go ahead of us all
Now I'm on the mainstream doing radio songs
[Pre-Chorus: Princess Nokia]
And I look to all that queens that inspire me
Feeling like a higher me, feeling like Aaliyah, 1993
I does this еntirely and I know they proud of me
Channеling their energy, yeah

[Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like Beyoncé, I feel like Shakira
Lemonade, I'm juicy, hips don't lie, Selena
Britney, Christina, rest in peace Aaliyah
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva

[Post-Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva

[Verso 2: Emilia & Princess Nokia]
Una diosa, mujer poderosa, diva
Toa' la vida una actitud desmedida
El mundo me lo hicieron a medida (Yeah)
Una business woman made in Argentina
El avión ahora lo tengo de oficina (Ey)
En un giro me cerraron una gira (Uy)
Baby, baby, baby, están llamando tarde
Maybe, maybe, maybe no puedo quitarme
Como en un ascensor, subí de nivel
Me tapan las nubes, no puedo ni ver (Ey)
Baby, you know what I'm saying
You might also like[Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like Beyoncé, I feel like Shakira (Shakira)
Lemonade, I'm juicy, hips don't lie, Selena (Selena)
Britney, Christina, rest in peace Aaliyah
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva

[Post-Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva

[Bridge]
I don't compare to nobody, I don't compete
We all just babies of the past, respect the queens (Yeah)
Ain't about the money (No), ain't about the fame (No)
I pray that one day in the future, they gon' remember my name
Tell me it can't be done, I'ma run it
Ain't no mistake, I keep it comin'
I'll just keep doing my thing, I'm making my ways how I can
If they paved the way, I'ma make a way
I'ma make a way

[Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like Beyoncé, I feel like Shakira (Ah)
Lemonade, I'm juicy, hips don't lie, Selena (Ah)
Britney, Christina, rest in peace Aaliyah
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva
[Post-Chorus: Princess Nokia]
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a diva
I feel like a goddess, I feel like a divaEmbed
