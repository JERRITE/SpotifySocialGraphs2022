Good luck Lyrics [lyrics of "Good Luck" with Tiago Mac & Bob do Contra]

[Chorus: Tiago Mac]
Today I looked at you and it's not well, your look moves me
I wish you good luck, but tell me what you have
Today, I looked at you and it's not well, your look moves me
I wish you good luck, but tell me what you have

[Verse 1: James Mac]
From here I feel the mood, I see how you are here
This sadness will only pass when you see what I have for you
Humans are just human and they think what they think
Does not live life and helps the other waiting for a reward
Everything is wrong, they are so glazed, just want to see what the world has
Everything is wrong, they so dignifying on Facebook
Will risk the flood, I know this is your craft
I ask you again, "Is the sacrifice worth?"
Tell me! Are you going to run or say, "I give up"?
Um, you can't choose, it's yours
Only to God is he said
The way is for those who run, long life for those who have lived
Go and go back in green and win
Who has a plan is not lost
[Verse 2: Bob]
Calm down, sweetheart
I'm with God here on the phone
He told me he knows my name
And you know everything I did, everything I did
And I would do it again
Being happy is a choice, do
If you chose to be a farce, for me you lost the grace
And it won't be free
Downstairs is the one who boo you
It is said that on the floor it never passes
And I follow a bird, I tie myself
Use the neck, she told me
I can even break the bone torso by bone
I want to see your soul, now asks me to break
I warned you of karma, you had me in your palm
And you deserve clapping for this performance of envy
That kills the soul and poison, that no one comes to save you
How can you, if you don't even move me, eat on?
Now you will see what it is to be bad, you will meet my self worse
In my best chorus, and it wasn't you who wrote
It must be the new self, or my old self
Because my new eu now wants more than you disguise
And swallow all these lies that I don't even know if you lived
Calm down, I'm with God here on the phone
He told me he knows my name
And you know everything I did, everything I did
And I would do it again, I came to be happy

Today I looked at you and it's not well, your look moves me
I wish you good luck, but tell me what you have
Today, I looked at you and it's not well, your look moves me
I wish you good luck, but tell me what you have4embed
