Fill My World Lyrics[Verse 1]
And when the silence comes
It breaks my heart
When I'm lonely
I always fall apart
And when I'm left behind
I climb the walls
Never knowing
If you really cared at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you get to where you're going
To the place you're meant to be
Still I'm holding out that you'll return to me
Somewhere
Somewhere beyond
[Chorus]
Turn the key
Please come back to me
What I'd give to know you'll fill my world again

[Verse 2]
Thе wind is screaming out
I pace the floor
And I wondеr, will I see your face once more?

[Pre-Chorus]
You were always here to save me
Like a sentinel in the dark
As the thunder keeps on rolling through my heart
But still, some way
I keep holding on

[Chorus]
Turn the key
Please come back to me
For how long will you be gone?
I'm barely breathing
Because all I know
Is that I miss you so
What I'd give to know you'll fill my world again

Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Till you'll come home

[Guitar Break]

[Chorus]
Turn the key
Please come back to me
For how long will you be gone?
I'm barely breathing
Because all I know
Is that I miss you so
What I'd give to know you'll fill my world again

[Outro]
Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Please come home
Oh
Please come homeEmbed
