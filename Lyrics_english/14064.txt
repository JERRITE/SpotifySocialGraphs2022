Death Is a Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
The love I know not above forgotten overnight
Live in the light
Air tight
The love I've no question of impossible designs
Live in the light
Thinking you're right (you're right)

[Chorus 1]
Oooo they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Air Tight (Air Tight)
Oooo they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Thinking you're right (You're Right)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if your lips have lost their red
You can always paint the rose instead

[Chorus 2]
You can make it easy
You don't know what you want, if you wanted
Even if your respirators leave
I never stuck around to breathe

[Chorus 3]
I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day
I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day

[Bridge]
You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
So maybe death is a girl and she's only one dance away

[Verse 2]
The love I sought not enough, erotic enterprise
Live in the light
Air tight (Air Tight)
The love a cross section of imaginary lines
Live in the light
Thinking you're right. (You're Right)
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Oooo they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Air Tight (Air Tight)
Oooo they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Thinking you're right (You're Right)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if the love was not in vain
Even if the gods forgot their names

[Chorus 2]
You can make it easy
You don't know what you want, if you wanted
Even if the sun’s about to show
I never stuck around to know

I’m not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there’s only one day

I’m not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there’s only one day
[Outro]
You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
Live in a world where there's only one day
Live in a world where there's only one day
Death is a girl and she's only one dance away
Okay
Okay
You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
Live in a world where there's only one day
Live in a world where there's only one day
Death is a girl and she's only one dance away
Okay
Live in a world where there's only one day
Live in a world where there's only one day
Death is a girl and she's only one dance...8Embed
