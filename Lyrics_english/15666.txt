Sometimes good and sometimes bad lyrics [letter of "sometimes good and sometimes bad"]

[Verse 1]
Ten nights go without speaking
I no longer endure this city
If you are not
No matter how much I tried to escape
I returned to the same place
And you are not
Of so many things I regret
You need me and I don't lie to you
How easy it was to love you and how difficult to forget
[Chorus]
How's it going?
Who are you with?
If someone asks
I live here waiting to return
Sometimes well
And sometimes bad
I don't know if the same happens to you too

[Verse 2]
Puzzle pieces are missing
My love has been hard
How the photos that keep adorning my table weigh
Oh how it hurts
Oh how it hurts when a man loses what he wants
Tell me, please, that our love did not die
How easy it was to love you and that I wouldn't give you see you once again

[Chorus]
How's it going?
Who are you with?
If someone asks
I live here waiting to return
Sometimes well
And sometimes bad
I don't know if the same happens to you too
You Might Also Like [Outro]
Oh
Oh oh oh oh
I know that the same happens to you too
Ten nights go without speaking
Sometimes well and sometimes Malembed
