666 - World Divided Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my life
I've believed in nothing but myself
Through my eyes
I have seen Heaven, I've seen Hell
All my life
I have been the one stigmatized
Know that I
I will not believe holy lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Diversity, integrity
Nailed to the crucifix
Loyalty, unity
In our heart it still exists
[Chorus]
The world is in flames
The people divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666
Burning in the sky

[Verse 2]
All my life
The weak bestow blood upon your sword
Through these eyes
I have seen the slaughter of the lost
All my life
I fight and resist, deviate
Know that I
Realized your dying truth is fake

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Perversity, slavery
In the name of the crucifix
Absurdity, atrocity
We won't let it come to this

[Chorus]
The world is in flames
The people divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666
Burning in the sky

Let it burn
(Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn)
Let it burn
(Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn)
Nothing can divide us
Nothing can divide us
Nothing can divide

[Bridge]
We are united
United in a world divided
We are united
United in a world divided
We are united
United in a world divided
We are united
United

[Chorus]
The world is in flames
They keep us divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666
Burning in the sky
A world divided
We are united
Under 666
Burning in the sky2Embed
