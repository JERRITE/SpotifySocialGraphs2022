Twenty miles lyricsme you ask more
Then leave
Your indecision, contradiction
Your fears anchored in my love

You never risk the heart
Always ahead the reason
You stole my fantasies for your voice

Twenty miles to sea
And the sea that wants to flee;
I half secret, you the road without end
I the idea fixed and you the ghost that goes
Twenty miles even I approached, you are no longer
You draw waves with a sun
And a pirate of brown
With brave costume, without color

Twenty miles to sea
And the sea that wants to flee;
I halfway the way, without end
I the idea fixed and you the ghost that goes
Twenty miles to you, I am no longer

Twenty miles to sea
And the sea that wants to flee;
I half secret ... without end
I the idea fixed and you the ghost that goes
Twenty miles to you, I am no longer

Twenty miles to sea
And the sea that wants to flee;
I halfway the way, without end
I the idea fixed and you the ghost that goes
Twenty miles until I approached, you are no longer
