Last Lyricsletra hour of "Last Hour" feat. Jowell and Randy, Lightning and Toby

[Intro: Mackie]
I already know where you have to give you
If you want we are already apart
There is everything and a couple of bottles
You already know what we are going to do

[Choir: Ray]
When you…
You get like that
You get Loquita
You touch Solita
When you…
You get like that (no No No ...)
You get Loquita
You touch Solita
[See 1: Mackie]
(Blan!)
Persivo flirted
I saw liquid on your finger
If you invite me I go and if I like it, I stay
I am not afraid, I can always
You have a peculiar form (BUAA)
A way to culiar (wao)
You get on my back and bend and play
And it doesn't clash, ask me with that mouth

[Bridge: Mackie]
Why…
As you look…
How rich it is ...
That you are ready, to the law of anything to come

[See 2: Ray]
You touch and excite you alone
A blon sticks, a drink and invites me
To incite it, it is harmful
But you never want to stop

[Choir: Ray]
When you…
You get like that
You get Loquita
You touch Solita
When you…
You get like that (no No No ...)
You get Loquita
You touch Solita

Baby, today we are giving the drink to see if we win
A trio with your friend, we put him and leave
And so drink
I bring you pull out of white
I want to eat you
And at 2 I jarto
You touch and excite you alone
A blon sticks, a drink and invites me
She insists, she's harmful
If you see me that we are going to start the
Ragankan sounds
All skirts rise
Call your partner who does not scare
The one that is not afraid to wet the whole blanket
We give it between 2 and love it

[Chorus: Randy, Ray & Randy]
When you…
You get like that ... ihhh
You get Loquita (Randy)
You touch Solita (vamo 'to break in balls)
When you…
You get like that ... ihhh
You get Loquita
You touch Solita (Dayme and El High)
[See 4: Randy]
When you get like this
Consumes of to ’even pink powder
For you every day are weekenes
Nymphomaniac 7 times
And that toto is asking Macana
From night to morning
It is dawn at papers
Let's give him until he fights
You have a peculiar form (BUAA)
That's why I want to abuse (Blan)
Like a insane, I'm going to sing you
In your mouth I want to finish

[Choir: Randy, Rayo & Randy, Rayo]
When you…
You get like that ... ihhh
You get Loquita
You touch Solita

When you…
You get like that
You get Loquita
You touch Solita

[See 5: Toby]
Like Loquita, you put yourself
You ride yourself, with to 'and heels
That little face of malita you put me
I don't think you forgive you tonight
Atrár me as a jellyfish
Today excuses are not worth
While touching alone, and Solita take off your blouse
Atrár me as a jellyfish
Today excuses are not worth
While touching alone, and Solita take off your blouse
