[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
D-D-D-D-D-Dy

[Pre-car: Daddy Yankee]
What's your name, Baby?
Since I saw you I knew you were to me
Tell your friends that Andamo 'Ready
This follows' in the After Party
What's your name, Baby? (BRR, BRR)
Since I saw you I knew you were to me
Tell your friends that Andamo 'Ready (go up!)
I followed this in the After Party (Su-Su, EY)
[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Calmly, I want to see how she wiggles
Move that poom-poom, girl
She is a murderer, when Dance wants the world to see her
I Like Your Poom-Poom, Girl (Sub-Sube!)
Calmly, I want to see how she wiggles
Move that poom-poom, girl
Has adrenaline, in the middle 'e the track, come, do me whatever
I Like Your Poom-Poom, Girl (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
I already saw that you are alone, join me
The night is from us ', you know it' (You know!)
What earns
From Guayarte, Mami, that Ram-Pam-Pam, Yeah
That criminal as it moves and 'a crime (oh)
I have to arrest you because I start and I don't take off (huh)
You have criminality, but I give you fatality
View the movie floating in my gravity
Daddy puts the rule ’, he has to obey
Mommy, he has no pause, what what are you going to do?
Check it, wipe it, go back to the back
Check out, meet, here and pa 'back (eh, ey-ey-ey)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Calmly, I want to see how she wiggles
Move that poom-poom, girl (girl)
She is a murderer, when Dance wants the world to see her
I Like Your Poom-Poom, Girl
Calmly, I want to see how she wiggles (calmly)
Move that poom-poom, girl
It has adrenaline, in the middle ’and the track, come, do me whatever
I Like Your Poom-Poom, Girl

You have 'Candela and I have the candle
Call 911, the sole are burning '
It harms me when the skirt models it
Mommy, 'Tás sick, but your show does not cancel it'
The Queen of the Party calls you
Much Sandunga has that body
Ty a step, not-do not stop, woh, give it, give it! (Me)
We are two bandit 'between rumba and romance
And Zúmbale, Dj, another sees 'pa' what dance
Check it, wipe it, go back to back
Check it, meet, here and pa 'back (ey, eh, ey)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Calmly, I want to see how she wiggles (calmly)
