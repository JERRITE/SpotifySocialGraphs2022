Hey Brittany Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey Brittany, why are you messing with me?
Is your boy on your mind?
Is your boy in your car?
Or are you alone?

So, why does everything I say
Just make you upset?
And I'm not here to bring you down
I'll lift you up, lift you up
[Pre-Chorus]
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Go ahead and lower it down
Lower it down, just a little bit
Just a little bit (Lower it down)

[Chorus]
So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)

So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)

[Verse 2]
Hey Brittany, where is your engagement ring?
Did it mean anything?
Does the boy with the ring
Know you bounce, bounce, bounce around?
So, how am I supposed to act
When you're around him?
When everything he says brings you down
Brings you down, brings you down
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Go ahead and lower it down
Lower it down, just a little bit
Just a little bit (Lower it down)

[Chorus]
So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)

So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)

[Bridge]
So, where do we go, when everybody says
You bounce, bounce, bounce around?
Where do we go, when everybody says
You bounce, bounce, bounce around?

[Pre-Chorus]
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Go ahead and lower it down
Lower it down, just a little bit
(Just a little bit)
[Chorus]
So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)

So, where do we go? (Where do we go?)
When you just have to fight to be alone1Embed
