The lion of the southern area, the incomparable (Woh, Woh)
Jadiel
Dembow Music, the Jedis

[Pre-car: Jadiel]
Hey, how are you doing? What's your name?
I want to meet you (Franco El Gorilla)
Why are you the woman who dominates me (Jadiel)
Hey, how are you doing? What's your name?
I want to meet you (the Jedis)
Why are you the woman who dominates me
To go with you, you and me alone
[Chorus: Jadiel & Franco El Gorilla]
To lower your heating (hey, baby)
To lower your heating (I just want to meet you, I want to know your name, Dembow Music)
To lower your heating (Wy Records, don't give you so much Guille)
To lower your heating (hey, mommy is ours, wy records!)
To lower your heating (let the music raise you)
Frank!

[Verse 1: Franco El Gorilla]
Good night, I'm frank and I want to invite you a drink
And your friends if you want, I also pay them
I just want to be kind, take it as a halago (SSS)
If it gives me 'a chance, I swear that I harong' (tra)
I would like to see you in underwear modeling me (Jah)
Looking at me with seduction and calmly tempting me (Jah)
Talking down to the ear, come, keep touching me (rra)
SSS, causing me (rra), SSS, causing me (rra)
I want to take off your clothes and kiss your mouth
If I touch you, get crazy, that causes you (Jah)
UUH, more whiskey to the rocks
Rrraa and pa'l troca troca '(Jah)

[Pre-car: Jadiel & Franco El Gorilla]
I would like to invite her to walk (hey, baby), go to dinner (I told you)
Since I realized that you are incomparable as me (do not resist you ')
I am not going to take away (the one of us is chemical)
Come to dance (okay?)
That you are incomparable like me
I would like to invite her to walk (hey, urba), go out to dinner
(Came with one with a friend)
Since I realized that you are incomparable like me
I don't get to remove (now tonight ... it's going to be perfect)
Let go, that you are incomparable like me (okay?)

[Verse 2: Franco El Gorilla]
Cool, I like your guille
I love to see what makeup you '
Black, I want you to get caught one day
It may be that one day for you I knelt
That strip the pride and humble me (rrra)
I want to go with you
Dialogue with you (Jah)
Pass me with you (Jah)
I really want to be your friend (Jah)
Bathe with you (Jah), that you relax with me (TSS)
You like punishment (Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah), that's why I want with you
Download this fever, Enrredao 'at your waist
I want to do 20 follies in the same adventure
If you swear that if I am sick, you come and heals me
To'as the nights I will be your slave and vo 'to ask torture (rrra)

[Pre-car: Jadiel & Franco El Gorilla]
I would like to invite her to walk (hey, baby), go out to dinner
(I only think about sliding my fingers on your back)
Since I realized that you are incomparable like me
I will not take away (I would like to get entangled in your hair)
Come to dance, that you are incomparable like me
I would like to invite her to walk (tonight is ours)
Go to dinner (I want to make my dream come true)
Since I realized that you are incomparable like me
I do not get rid (and I know that I am your dream)
Let go, that you are incomparable like me
(Hey, this is wy record ')
[Chorus: Jadiel]
To lower your heating (the incomparable; Dembow Music)
To lower your heating (the Jedis; Urba and Monserrate)
To lower your heating ("The best of me" Comin 'Soon)
To lower your heating (we 'somo' something else, did you hear?)

[Outro: Jadiel]
And the rookie comes hard, so do not make mistakes
I'm going to miles
The incomparable
The lion of the southern area, Yeh (Yeh, Yeh)
Urba & Monserrate, the Jedis
This is the union of the strongest companies in the genus
Wy Records & Dembow Music
The lion and the embed gorilla
