Chloe Dancer (Demo) LyricsChloe don't know better
Chloe's just like me (only beautiful)
A couple of years difference
But those lessons never learned (ya know)
Chloe danced the tables in the French Quarter
Always been different, but you can't always make me laugh
And I'm proud to say, that I won't forget
Time spent laying by her side, time spend laying by her side
Time spent laying by her side ( oh yeah)(oh yeah)
Oh baby And a dream like this must die
Dreams like this mustYou might also likeEmbed
