One of Us Lyrics[Verse 1: Amanda Seyfried]
They pass me by
All of those great romances
It’s as if you’re robbing me
Of my rightful chances
My picture clear
Everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus 1: Amanda Seyfried]
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it’s different
I want you to know...
[Chorus: Amanda Seyfried & Dominic Cooper]
One of us is crying
One of us is lying in her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only waiting for a call
Sorry for himself
Feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing he had never left at all

[Verse 2: Amanda Seyfried]
I saw myself
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Just like a child
Stubborn and misconceiving

[Pre-Chorus 2: Amanda Seyfried]
That’s how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I’ve changed
And I want you to know

[Chorus 2: Amanda Seyfried & Dominic Cooper]
One of us is crying
One of us is lying in her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead5Embed
