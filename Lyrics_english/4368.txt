Felina Lyrics [Felina lyrics with Wiu & Mc Ryan SP]

[Intro: Wiu]
What will be the sensation? (Ah)
That she feels to look in the mirror and see that she is the most cat (yeah)
That since young, this feline look
You have to be careful if you don't kill (ah-ai, oh)
Abused, from the north with a face closed

[Interlude: Wiu]
It's fucking, wiu, hahaha
Oh, oh, huh
[Chorus: Wiu]
Oh, my God, look at the way she goes
I pretend I didn't understand anything
Oh, my God, gives me holy patience
I will need courage (Ye-EH)
Oh, my God, I saw her from Cantin '
I noticed Jeitin ', that curly hair
I wish I was the guy
I wish I was blessed

[Verse 1: wiu]
You have Paty Jeitin '
If I didn't know you even I said where you live
It even remembers those blonde
What a glue on the show, which comes from Aldeota
But your crazy way
Trained Maloque
That's what makes me intrigued
Hey, Cumadi, the Nego 'is so in yours
How much do you charge to get out of my head?
It can be in pix, with so much that I forget you
But not that I want
(I don't want not)

[Chorus: Wiu]
Oh my God, look at the way she passes (look at Jeitin ')
I pretend I didn't understand anything (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh my God, gives me holy patience (yeah, u-uh)
I will need courage (Ye -yeh)
Oh my God, I saw her from Cantin '
I noticed Jeitin ', that curly hair (wow)
I wish I was the guy
I wish I was blessed

(Hahaha, license here, wiu)
Courage I don't miss, what I lack is luck
It looks a lot of sand for my truck
The soul of avoada kite, lived on this road
CALVED HEART OF SO MANY BLUFE '
What am I going to talk at home to the mirror, my mirror?
If in the act of the sung, she does not answer me
I was always from the flock and it happened
Cat took my heart by assault for you
I got into that hair, I traveled on the wiggling
And I saw that you put my heart to roll
You exist is a low blow, I follow loud, indignant
Seeing my soul wreck
Why don't you get out of my head and come to my bed?
'You live in thought more than in your house
You live in my smile, in my certainty
I just want time to accept what the mind already says

[Bridge: MC Ryan SP]
Oh, wiu
I think I fell in love this time, huh, oh
Tubar√£o da Vanda fell in love with the dream brunette
Haha ha

[Chorus: Wiu]
Oh, my God, look at the way she passes (look at Jeitin ')
I pretend I didn't understand anything (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, my God, gives me holy patience (yeah, u-uh)
I will need courage (Ye -yeh)
Oh, my God, I saw her from Cantin '
I noticed Jeitin ', that curly hair (wow)
I wish I was the guy
I wish I was blessed
