Traveller’s Chant Lyrics[Verse 1: Jordan]
Last week
I was passenger in a car seat
Thinking of decisions
That I made within a heartbeat
She used to make my heart beat
It usually alarms me
My lungs are overworking
And I can't breathe
Yes I convinced myself
I didn't like relationship malarkey
But she said "Wait, you didn't ask me
How I felt"
I said "I love that you're a nice girl
And I'm sorry but this really wasn't timed well."
It kinda feels like it was mainly a blur
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer
Feel I gotta scratch the surface
Gotta break it to learn
And now I multiply the times
In which the tables have turned
[Chorus: Jordan and Harley]
I call this the Traveller's Chant
Whether you're sitting on a train
Or in the back of a car
Thinking maybe it's me
Yes I do have places to be
(Got places to be)
And do I start at the end
Or do I end at the start?
In this little bit of time
Will I get very far?
Maybe it's me
Yes I do have places to be
And I'll be there

[Verse 2: Jordan]
Yeah the other day
I was sitting on the train
But in another place
I was on my way home
But maybe some would say
I was thinking about the days I'd wanna run away
I've only really got a couple mates
Me, myself and I, how cliché
Looking out the window
Feels like I'm in a film
Director, producer and as it happens
I'm the main character
Yeah, my own little feature length
Soundtrack being whatever's in my speakers then
I'd rather not be held accountable
I bank on people's feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent
Yeah, and in a deeper sense
Sometimes I need the rain
It helps me kinda clean my head
The sun's an easy friend
I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey's
Helped me reconnect my feelings then
You might also like[Chorus]

And I'll be there
