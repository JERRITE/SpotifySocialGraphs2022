TranslationsفارسیWhat They’ll Say About Us Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're tired now, lie down
I'll be waitin' to give you the good news
It might take patience
And when you wake up, it won't be over
So don't you give up

[Chorus]
We've got the time to take the world
And make it better than it ever was
That's what they'll say about us
[Verse 2]
If I say a cliché, it's 'cause I mean it
We can't walk away, we gotta get in between it
And when you wake up, we'll grow together
So don't you give up

[Chorus]
We've got the time to take the world
And make it better than it ever was
That's what they'll say about us

[Bridge]
I never said it would be easy
I'm never giving up, believe me
I used to think the pain would fade, but it never does

[Outro]
You're tired now, lie down
I'll be waitin' to give you the good news
It might take patience
And if you don't wake up
I'll know you tried to
I wish you could see him
He looks just like youYou might also like31Embed
