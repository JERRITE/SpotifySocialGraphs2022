Pi√©rde me respect - Live [Roberto Cantoral Cultural Center] Lyricsya I don't want flowers
I want colored nights
Where I condense
And in your hands I evaporate me
Do not write to me cards in English
I want those kisses in French
Take me higher than Mount Everest
Come, I'm going to melt in my heat, I'm a sun, you are ice
Come, come and wet your lips with alcohol
And travel my body, satu my thirst
Discover the secret in my neck
Merde me the skin, come and give me respect
Leave me the moon and stars in the sky
If you are going to get something to take me back to the ground
Don't dedicate me the song, where you cry for my heart
Come and sing me the alphabet of love
Come, I'm going to melt in my heat, I'm a sun, you are ice
Come, come and wet your lips with alcohol
And travel my body, satisfy my thirst, discover the secret in my neck
Merde me the skin, come and give me respect
Come and pile up respect
Come, I'm going to melt in my heat
Come, come and wet your lips with alcohol
Come, I'm going to melt in my heat, I'm a sun, you are ice
Come, come and wet your lips with alcohol
And travel my body, satisfy my thirst with your fingers
Discover the secret in my neck, make me the skin
Come and pile up respect
Oh, come and give me respect
Come and get the respectyou might also likembed
