North Face Bombers Lyrics[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Yeah, I got 'em hella thirst
Comin' through with hella work, this better work
I was in some storms you couldn't weather hurt
Uptown hustler, sell you the game and a shirt
In all platforms, even in the metaverse
Before it got here, we was mailing first
Through the drought, we will immerse
Took a little patience, we was still in dirt
Born in the '80s
Crack birthed a lot of premature babies
Father's ghost way before Swayze
Hoppin' out Mercedes, it's KG
They feel a don
Bad bitch to feel up on
And zero bond
Every time you see me, got an iller charm
Layers of game, I could give you some
All my pillars strong, millions I cleared
A nigga been gettin' money for years
As it appears, I'm really fuckin' cool and I'm lovin' it here
Extra cozy with some bud in the air
Yeah
[Interlude]
This is really fucking cool

[Verse 2: The Game]
Uzi, Draco, or FN, I'm gon' be with a weapon
Chopper kick like the Drunken Master when you playing Tekken
The section is the section
I'm Carhartt flexin'
Balenciaga Pendleton, they think I'm half Mexican
Play and get dealt with, you ain't never felt this
Double barrel sawed-off, I come through and melt shit
Leave him leaking like lava, hit his pockets for his wallet
Then leave his next of kin a couple thousand dollars
Think about your kids before you talk that shit
'Cause the coroner be outlining chalk that quick
Tell God you coming
No smoke, let's get into something
You seen LeBron just posted that all white Hummer
Yeah, we outside this summer
Fuck Instagram, we back writin' down bitches' numbers
North Face bomber, don't fail me now
If you ain't ready to die, bitch, you better tell me nowYou might also likeEmbed
