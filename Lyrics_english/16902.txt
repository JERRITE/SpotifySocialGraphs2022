Never Shouldâ€™ve Let You Go Lyrics[Verse 1: Tony Thompson]
Girl, when I first met you, I didn't realize
You were looking to stay around but I was looking to play around
Now I can't forget you, can't forget your pretty smile
Took for granted the love you gave
And only thought of the love we made

[Pre-Chorus: Tony Thompson]
Just when I found someone who could love me
Like the way that I need
I acted the fool and pushed her away from me
[Chorus: Hi-Five]
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I'll know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so (Tell you so)
That I never should have let you go

[Verse 2: Tony Thompson]
Do you think about me like I wasn't worth your time?
I would give anything I have if you give me another chance
Do you think you're better off without me?
Playing games with your heart and mind, oh yeah
I don't blame you for leaving me but now you gotta believe in me

[Pre-Chorus: Tony Thompson]
If you come back, girl, I promise that you'll see a change in my ways
I'll get down on my knees, I'll do anything you say

[Chorus: Hi-Five & (Tony Thompson)]
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day (Every day)
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so
That I never should have let you go

Is there someone else standing where I stood
Giving you the love you never got from me?
Girl, I would give you the world if I only could
Girl, you will see, will you come back to me
Won't you come back to me?

[Chorus: Hi-Five & (Tony Thompson)]
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
'Cause in my heart I'll know (I'll know)
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so (Tell you so)
That I never should have let you go (Oh yeah)

[Outro: Hi-Five & (Tony Thompson)]
And I'll be thinking 'bout you every night and every day
(Every night and every day)
'Cause in my heart I'll know
That I never should have let you go
And my love for you is stronger than I ever knew
But I couldn't tell you so, no, I never should have let
No, I never should have let
No, I never should have let you go
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)Embed
