Youâ€™re Always On My Mind Lyrics[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
On my mind

[Verse 1: Coko]
Boy, I can't seem to get you outta my head
But there's something about you that makes me smile
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for a while?
[Pre-Chorus: Brian Morgan]
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
You're always on my mind, ooh, baby
You're always on my mind, oh, all the time
You're always on my mind
I'm thinking of you
You're always on my mind
On my mind

[Verse 2: Coko]
Sometimes I find it hard to concentrate
Because thoughts of us together fill my head
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Morgan]
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
All the time (All the time)
You're always on my mind
Thinking 'bout you, baby
You're always on my mind
And you are on my mind

[Bridge]
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (On my mind)
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (I just can't stop thinking)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (On my mind)
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (You're always on my mind)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (On my mind)
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (All the time)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (On my mind)

[Chorus]
You're always on my mind, baby
You're always on my mind
(You got me thinking, thinking of you)
You're always on my mind
You're always (Always)
You're always on my mind
Nobody but, nobody but you (You got me thinking 'bout, you got me thinking 'bout)
You're always on my mind (You got me thinking 'bout you)
[Outro]
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (Baby, baby)
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (Baby, baby)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya (All I do)
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (All I do is think of you)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (You're always on my mind)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (On my mind, you're always on my mind)
Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya
I can't stop thinking 'bout ya (You're always on my mind)
Thinking 'bout ya2Embed
