Step Harder Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck nigga, yeah
You know they hate to see I'm still alive out here, I'm still out here, nigga
Yeah, you gotta come step harder when you steppin', nigga

[Chorus]
He said when he catch me, he gon' shake somethin'
But when ATK spin, it's a murder one
We got Dracos, we got Tommy guns
I'm ten toes down, I won't ever run
But them niggas pussy as a bitch, I told them niggas step harder
Up the price up on my head, I told them bitches step harder
You sent your bitch to try to set me up, you better step harder
Riding 'round in an Uber, bitch, you better move smarter
Swinging 'round in that jungle, I be out there head first
Hit him for times in the chest, make a nigga head burst
Jacksonville police tryna lock me up for what I said in my verse
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm a stepper, and I'ma kill that bitch first
[Verse 1]
Kids will be mad when them niggas ain't out when we slide through
You claim you on the block, that's not true
I was mad when he died and not you
Braggin' when I got shot like that was you
Boy, you pussy as a bitch, you shot who?
I'm still undefeated I can't lose
Since you want to be famous, put his ass in the news
I'm Handy Manny way I'm strapped with the tool
Stop all that flaggin', I let you have it
Speak on my name, you could die too
When the AR bullet starts flying, he frozed up, he ain't know what to do
So when that bitch die, he die confused
I follow them codes 'cause I know what to do
I told my bitch need to still go to school
[?] have them killers outside for you

[Chorus]
He said when he catch me, he gon' shake somethin'
But when ATK spin, it's a murder one
We got Dracos, we got Tommy guns
I'm ten toes down, I won't ever run
But them niggas pussy as a bitch, I told them niggas step harder
Up the price up on my head, I told them bitches step harder
You sent your bitch to try to set me up, you better step harder
Riding 'round in an Uber, bitch, you better move smarter
Swinging 'round in that jungle, I be out there head first
Hit him for times in the chest, make a nigga head burst
Jacksonville police tryna lock me up for what I said in my verse
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm a stepper, and I'ma kill that bitch first

When that pressure applied you ain't never outside
You talking that shit like you ready to die
Got shooters on go when I tell them to slide
They feel like calling you dyke when you hide
Don't come around me if you ain't ready to die
One in the head right now it can go down
Some niggas outside of your car right now
Even for my chain I'll shut this bitch down
Tony Montana, I'm ready for war
Stepped on that boy you can't tell what I saw
You can run but you can't run far
Murder one it's the same rod
Different body you can't tell apart
Bitch the Glock we gon' hit em hard
You think I'm a bitch I'm gonna shoot him in his shit
My hands play defense and they love the licks

[Chorus]
He said when he catch me, he gon' shake somethin'
But when ATK spin, it's a murder one
We got Dracos, we got Tommy guns
I'm ten toes down, I won't ever run
But them niggas pussy as a bitch, I told them niggas step harder
Up the price up on my head, I told them bitches step harder
You sent your bitch to try to set me up, you better step harder
Riding 'round in an Uber, bitch, you better move smarter
Swinging 'round in that jungle, I be out there head first
Hit him for times in the chest, make a nigga head burst
Jacksonville police tryna lock me up for what I said in my verse
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm a stepper, and I'ma kill that bitch first1Embed
