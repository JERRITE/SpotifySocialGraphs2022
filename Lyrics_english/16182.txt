Polaroid Lyrics [text by "Polaroid"]

[Verse 1: Carl Brave]
Let's gallop in SH, 'namo riding
She is beautiful too bad that she is Lella
Because you cry to the Pora Stella license
They rejected you because you started in third
I skipped my grandfather's birthday
The next day he died, I embraced him in a dream
She, at her feet Jeffrey Campbell (Yeh, eh, eh)
I canceled you from social media, in hand a bowl
'This life encompasses me
On a fifty I go quickly
Detaching a random helmet to a underseat in via Libetta
"I call me I love 'I can't find the cell phone anymore?"
We who laugh even if we are badly put
I break the keys in the top box
We always in that baretto
It is a life that you look like
[Refrain: Franco 126]
And you always smile but you can see that I bore you
We who are sick on all Polaroid
And I also brought you to dinner out with yours
But so much it ends everything sooner or later
And you always smile but you can see that I bore you
We who are sick on all Polaroid
And I also brought you to dinner out with yours
But so much it ends everything sooner or later

[Verse 2: Franco 126]
Last night I made tabula rasa
I go down to throw the dust under the house
In the pocket half the Atac ticket
And someone above the wall wrote acab
Go quietly so much everything is right
My friend who is cooked asks me if I approach
I don't have a penny, you take you on with 4088
And my mother seems to me all to a bang
I have the clothes scattered and the torn memories
I am looking for two equal socks among the aforementioned ones
In the photo we have red eyes and we are all moved
And today I'm late and I also took red
I lost my keys in the manhole
Holded windows drawing us with your finger
You are it ita you can see that it was destiny
I have red lips for wine
You Might Also Like [refrain: Franco 126]
And you always smile but you can see that I bore you
We who are sick on all Polaroid
And I also brought you to dinner out with yours
But so much it ends everything sooner or later
And you always smile but you can see that I bore you
We who are sick on all Polaroid
And I also brought you to dinner out with yours
But so much it ends everything sooner or later
