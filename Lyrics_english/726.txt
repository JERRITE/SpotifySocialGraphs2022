[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
When a woman decides to be bad and does not want owner
Probably a man cheated on her in her life, without feelings
Rumba, the past buried him in the grave
The bad has life, the good is the deceased
Now, Pal 'fuck the envy of all
Every bobolon that approaches her ignores it
So quiet that it was the baby
Now it's Candela
I see her hunting with twenty bottles
I feel a problem
I am helpful with your wishes
If you ask me how to kelly I- (Nasty)
I don't like shamaquitas
I just do what the baby excites
He failed him-ó and betrayed him-ó
Now she is going to take revenge on my bed
[Chorus: Anuel AA]
She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed her
And that's why he is going to rumbar (rumbear)
She wants to drink, she wants to dance
Her boyfriend left her and wants to forget her
She delivered and the guy failed her
And that's why he is going to rumbar
