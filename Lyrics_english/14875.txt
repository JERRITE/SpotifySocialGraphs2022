We Die Young Lyrics[Chorus]
Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

[Verse 1]
Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you should've known better

[Chorus]
And we die young
Faster we run
[Verse 2]
Down, down, down you're rolling
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

[Chorus]
And we die young
Faster we run

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

[Verse 3]
Another alley trip
Bullets seek the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you should've known better
Faster we run
And we die youngYou might also like4Embed
