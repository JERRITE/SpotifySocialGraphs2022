Ohchee Walla LyricsOo ohchee walla
You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a colla

Oo ohchee walla
You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a colla
I just hit the follas
And threw a lotta moneys
I met a couple thotties
And brought 'em to the party
Took 'em from the party
Straight to the after party
And then the hotel lobby
You nigga hold my body

I just hit the deali
Was tryna spend a milli
Don't know which one a fit me
I bought 2 fucking Bentley
Went and got the 10 peace
And he bought me fendi
Na I'm acting snotty
Broke niggas get the cotties

Rolla just got bust down
My stock is going up now
Yo me can't get bust down
His D heavy like uptown
Your money so up down
Racks up high it's stuck now
My shirt be getting tuck now
Big dawg just sit the fuck down

You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a colla

Oo ohchee walla
You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a colla

Ay where the money
Don't ask me for my number
Wish this pussy wet
I hope that nigga a good swimmer
He say he my ex
Sorry bro I don't remember
I hope that card is black
I'm 'bout to swipe it like it's tinder hun
Get yo racks up, boy come pick yo cap up, hun
Ayy come get yo bitch, that goofy shit gone make me act up hun
Tell that hoe the back up
Fo I act up you get clapped up
You know this bitch is scary
She need back up for the back up

Two ballers they wanna give me toppa
Ass so fat that shit could sing up in the Opera
Ain't from Memphis but I'm popping my coller
All them hoes be yelling when I walk up with them dollas

Oo ohchee walla
You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a colla

Oo ohchee walla
You know I like the balla
I spend a lot of dollars
On Dolche & Gabana
Might just switch the Prada
Just cause I got the galu
You know I like the ball out
I'm poppin like a collaEmbed
