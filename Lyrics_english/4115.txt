The Lyricsletra Plan of '' The Plan '' [verse 1]
Between what you want and I want
There is much to do to think in Peros
You just take advantage of your parents left
And in a week they will not return

I promise you true days
Take you to places they never saw
But you have to leave everything ready first
And so nobody will discover our plan
[Chorus]
// Yeah, nobody will know our plan
Yeah, we have the best plan
We are too
When your parents leave
Together we had a good time
They will never know
Before they arrived
Just like the plan //

[Verse 2]
When they tell you goodbye, then they close the door
You make me signs of come, but keep alert
I approach little by little and I notice that I was open
I enter and she tells me: go up to you have fun

I look at you and tell you:
What if we leave?
And she knows me so much
Who already knows destiny

Mommy I have little time
You already know how I live
I am making an effort
To escape with you

To climb your navel
You know I don't regret
With you there is no lost time

[Chorus]
// Yeah, nobody will know our plan
Yeah, we have the best plan
We are too
When your parents leave
Together we had a good time
They will never know
Before they arrived
Just like the plan //

[Verse 3]
And these days wandering with you for the world
They made me value each second fucking
Your father hates the photo where we are together
And I laugh at him when we do it hidden

We both know what we do
We both know science
Follow the plan we have
Or assume the consequences
When we arrive at your home
I will delete my presence
Good the plan we have
We delete all the evidence

[Chorus]
// Yeah, nobody will know our plan
Yeah, we have the best plan
We are too
When your parents leave
Together we had a good time
They will never know
Before they arrived
Just like the plan // embed
