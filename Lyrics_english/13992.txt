Up the Bracket Lyrics[Intro]
Can't have it

[Verse 1]
I saw two shadow men on the Vallance Road
They said they'd pay me for your address
Oh, I was so bold
I said, "You see these two cold fingers?
These crooked fingers I show?"
You a way to mean no
Well, they didn't like that much, I can tell you
He said, "Sunshine, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes"
Then they chased me up three flights of stairs
Caught me in the lift, I sighed and said
"Hello," but you're impossible
[Chorus]
And it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
Now he'll wind up like Joseph, bloody in a hole
It's just like she's in another world
You know they suit each other, oh, no
'Cause you never get close
It's impossible

[Verse 2]
Saw the same two men on the Cally Road
Said now they double their offer, I was so bold
To say, "You see these two cold fingers, I know
These crooked fingers, I show
Oh, you's a way to mean no"

[Chorus]
But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
And he'll end up like Joseph, bloody in a hole
It's just like she's in another world
And now they suit each other, oh, no
But you never get close
(Crazy, no, no, no, unstoppable)

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Bridge]
Fuck off

[Chorus]
But it's just like we're all in another world
And how we suit each other, oh, no
But you never get close
That's close enough now2Embed
