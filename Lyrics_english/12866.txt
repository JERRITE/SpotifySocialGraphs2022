Donâ€™t Go Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'd seen the pictures, life seemed all the richer
Sentimental, perfect smile
Social grace and oldie style
He's alright, I said
No surprises there
Met him a month late
Same old laughter, nothing's changed
Big ambition, future plans
Put his best days in my hands
He's alright, I said
So that's it settled then
[Chorus]
Don't go alone
I can't lose you
Why did you have to go like that?

[Verse 2]
Why'd we fail to see it?
Selfishly still sleeping
Left with nothing, not a sign
Missing diaries, different mind
He's alright, we said
Now look what's come of it

[Chorus]
Don't go alone
I can't lose you
Why did you have to go like that?
I'll never know if I could have saved you
If it was my place to hold you back
Hold you back, hold you back, hold you back
Hold you back, hold you back, hold you back (x2)You might also like1Embed
