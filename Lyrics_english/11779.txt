For the rest of my life infinite is this moment, that sacred this moment
To look at us face and listen to us in silence
I feel that in the deepest and immense of this calm
Our grief and dramas are resolved forever

Beyond pleasure and pain or good and evil
That we brought loaded, to this point of the road
I have left my luggage, I have emptied my pockets
I have reached your door, to continue with you

For the rest of my life and in the time that I stayed
I will travel aimlessly, where our love takes us
From the most sublime sky, to the abyss of the days
I will love you intensely, for the rest of my life
If your heart keeps me, there will be no strength to move away
I don't know what the world brings us, or fate, or death
I only know that from your soul, a music invites me
To sail in your hands, for the rest of my life

We will change without remedy, one changes all the time
He moves from horizons, certainties and fears
Everything turns in this wheel, everything changes in an instant
I change my life for example, when you arrived

But there is in both of them, an essence that will not change
I know your soul and mine were always sought
And although the time of the years, transforms us and reinvent us
I want to wake up with you and discover you forever

For the rest of my life and in the time that I stayed
I will travel aimlessly, where our love takes us
From the most sublime sky, to the abyss of the days
I will love you intensely, for the rest of my life

If your heart keeps me, there will be no strength to move away
I don't know what the world brings us, or fate, or death
I only know that from your soul, a music invites me
To navigate in your hands, for the rest of my lifeyou might Also Likeembed
