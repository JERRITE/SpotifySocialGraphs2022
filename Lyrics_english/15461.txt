Tour that turns Lyricshay you did not study for a test
You copied in class and the teacher cach
You like a kid and you don't peel
And to top it up in another room

Sometimes school
It's a nightmare
Sometimes you would like
Find an exit

Tour that revolves
Keep going around
For a bad day
Never stop
Tour that revolves
Keep going around
For a bad day
Never stop, no
That summer is yet to come
And another year you soon have to pass
That summer is yet to come
And another year you soon have to pass

You left at home a task
But the story did not believe it
On Friday entering there is a party
But your father already said no

Sometimes school
It's a nightmare
Sometimes you would like
Find an exit
Sometimes school
It's a nightmare
Sometimes you would like
Find an exit
