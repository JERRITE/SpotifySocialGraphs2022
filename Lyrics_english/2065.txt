Bubalu Lyrics ["Bubalu" ft letter. Becky G & Prince Royce]

[Enter: Prince Royce]
(OH-OH, YEAH; OH-OH, UH, UH; YEAH, YEAH)

[Saying: Prince Royce & Anuel AA]
Since I saw you I knew you were for me
Now look here, your heart beats for me (for me)
But I didn't know how to value you, baby, I did bad
You have me here, talking to myself in the mirror (-pejo)
Wondering why I feel you far (far)
Look what was built from a simple desire
But if you all died
(Anuel)
[Chorus: Anuel AA & Prince Royce]
Let me enter as before (EH)
When you and I were lovers (uah, uah)
Baby, I'm not to miss you (OH-OH-OH)
This has taken an interesting turn
Let me enter like before
When you and I were lovers
Baby, I'm not to miss you
This has taken an interesting turn

[Verse 1: Anuel AA & Prince Royce]
My bubalú
I strange biting you all and your blue hair (blue)
I spend only at the Ferrari thinking about you and the engine 'tá in the trunk
Return (come back)
Without you to Los Angele 'they cry
That's why clouds' they rain
A vece 'one does not know what one has until he loses it
You killed even Cupid (-part)
They were so many promise that none 'I have fulfilled them (I have fulfilled them)
Baby, I miss your groan 'and your happiness does not impose it
But you already did your life and I hate your husband (BRR)
And I would like the time 'to be as before' (before ')
But since I was a fake, huh
And I failed and I disappointed you (eh), uah
And the love of bystro 'I infect him

[Verse 2: Becky G & Prince Royce]
I am the usual, she is a fashion (fashion)
Tell him that I am the one who wants to steal (steals)
When you touch her, baby, you think me
Dare to neglect it
Vamo 'to do it as before (Yah)
I wait for you in my room
I want you to make me lose control
Obviously, without looking for love (Woah)
Carnal desire, even if the heart does not approve
And I lie if I say I don't think
In our first meeting
Everything that entailed only a kiss
How to forget that it ended melee?

This has taken an interesting turn (Ska '!)
