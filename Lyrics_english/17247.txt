Early in the Morning Lyrics[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
Oh, I never knew I loved you 'til you left me
Oh, I never knew I cared 'til you were gone
I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I'd lost you 'til you're gone
Oh, I never knew I loved you 'til you were gone

[Chorus]
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early (Early) in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover
Gotta get up early in the morning (Gotta get up early in the morning)
To find me another lover
[Verse 2]
Now I gotta get up early every morning
'Cause the early bird always catches the worm
Now I gotta get up every morning
Gotta make up for the lesson I learned
Gotta find me a lover that won't run for cover
Gotta find me a lover that won't run to mother

[Chorus]
'Cause I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover

[Bridge]
I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know what I'd lost 'til you were gone
She had a pretty face that drove men wild
I even wanted her to have my child

[Chorus]
Early in the morning (Early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early, early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Early, early in the morning)
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning (Get up early in the morning)
To find me another lover

Late at night, mama
