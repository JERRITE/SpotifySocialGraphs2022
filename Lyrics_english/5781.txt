Ballroom Figured LyricsDid you ever loan me that song?
Did you ever know me at all?
We listened to the world going wrong
Looking through a hole in the wall

Shoving our loving away
Leaving our light on the side
Never once looking to say
We got the ride of our lives

Did we ever find a way
To steer through the cold light of day?
'Cause we're just passing through
And it ain't what you don't but it is what you do
Soon as time comes and goes
Soon on the verge of who knows
A sound we're dancing around
Turn up the music and drown

Did we ever find a way
To steer through the cold light of day?
'Cause we're just passing through
And it ain't what you don't but it is what you do
Let's go, let's go

Some people change
Move out of range
All in a day
So long, so long

So let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Did you ever loan me that song?
Did you ever know me at all?You might also like2Embed
