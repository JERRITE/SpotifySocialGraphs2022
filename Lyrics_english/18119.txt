Two face, two face, yeah
Black, white, left, right, yeah
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Don't forget my name
I don't feel the same
On a trip, no train

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden
[Chorus]
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out

[Verse 2]
Everybody said that I'm falling, uh
Took another line, I'm calling, uh
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit, uh
I don't really think I'm the problem
I don't really think it's a problem
Me plus me is a problem
One gunshot I could solve 'em
Tell my friends I'm sorry, though
T-t-t-tell my sins to God

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

[Chorus]
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out

And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm falling from Eden

[Chorus]
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out
So fuck me like a rockstar, dancing on a cop car
Nothing in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a rockstar, riding in a cop car
No one in the world can help me out
