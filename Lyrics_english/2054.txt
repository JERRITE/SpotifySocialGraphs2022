Donâ€™t Talk About Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Natasha]
I wanna go somewhere where we can dirty up and be alone
Get in the back seat of your caddy, fog it up and let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Emmalyn & (Lauren) & All]
Carve my initials in the dirt with my stiletto so you'll know
(Carve my initials in the dirt with my stiletto so you'll know)
That we were here, now turn me up so loud, we gotta crank the radio (radio)

[Chorus: All]
Just don't talk about love, don't talk about love
Don't mess it up, don't mess it up
Don't talk about love, don't talk about love
Don't mess it up, don't mess it up
[Post-Chorus: Natasha]
Shh! shh! Don't mess it up
Shh! Shh!

[Verse 2: Simone & Lauren]
Just wanna uh-oh by the starlight
Please don't jinx it all with words
(Just wanna uh-oh by the starlight,)
(Please don't jinx it all with words)
'Cause we don't know what this could be
Don't say it please, yeah mum's the word

[Pre-Chorus: Simone & Natasha & All]
Let's stir it up and mix it up, get buzzed on us 'till it's a blur
(Let's stir it up and mix it up, get buzzed on us 'till it's a blur)
'Til we wake up and see the sun, let's heat it up and we can watch it burn

[Chorus: All]
Just don't talk about love, don't talk about love
Don't mess it up, don't mess it up
Don't talk about love, don't talk about love
Don't mess it up, don't mess it up

[Post-Chorus: Natasha]
Shh! shh! Don't mess it up
Shh! Shh!
