Committed Lyricschorus:

They tell me that you are committed
And you are looking for a new love in your life
I just want to explore your fantasies
And lose me in your kisses my life

See:

Just tell what time
Although you are with him
Come ma, move, move
He doesn't love you anymore, he wants
When he expects you at home
You are with me
And baby when he calls you
You're here
Chorus:

Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me leave
Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me leave


They tell me that you are committed
And you are looking for a new love in your life
I just want to explore your fantasies
And lose me in your kisses my life

See:

Nena as you do
To be with a fool who does not please you
You will fall in love with me and I will make that happen
You are doing mine only with a phrase
All night you in my bed doing it
Just you and me

Chorus:

Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me.
Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me.
You might Also Likea tell me that you are committed
And you are looking for a new love in your life
I just want to explore your fantasies
And lose me in your kisses my life

Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me leave
Committed to night and day
It doesn't matter if you are with him or with me leave
