I GIVE LYRICSBRINDO THIS LOVE 
 Such a rare love 
 I offer this love 
 Such a clear love 
 I offer this love 
 A love so suddenly, oh 
 I offer this love 
 Such a different love, oh 

 Like the Orsita in the sea 
 A new element to play 
 I provide to this love 
 That fills me with hope, oh 
 And I giving that light there in the distance, oh 
 Come hummingbird, wake up the goddess oh 
 That sings to you and her beautiful song, oh 

 I offer everything I want to give 
 To everything that is about to start 

 I offer this love 
 That is never delayed 
 Only the hospital is open at this time 

 I don't think about you, I just feel you 
 Going through me like a sweet wind 
 I don't think about you, I just feel you 
 Going through me like a sweet windyou might also likembed
