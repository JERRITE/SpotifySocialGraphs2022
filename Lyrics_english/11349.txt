Steady Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Silvery teardrops trickling down my windshield
Silvery teardrops trickling down my windowpane

[Chorus]
Steady rain falls all night and day
And the vapors ride the wind away

[Verse 2]
I remember when the thunder hit the radio like a fist
And you kissed me with your face all dewy wet
Once upon a time, I thought it would be easy to forget
But these misty memories of you are driving me insane, love
[Chorus]
Steady rain falls all night and day
And the vapors ride the wind away

[Bridge]
Shiny tears keep falling

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Silvery teardrops trickling down my windshield
Silvery teardrops
Silvery teardrops
Silvery teardrops
