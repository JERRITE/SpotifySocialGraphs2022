All or nothing lyrics [letter of "all or nothing"]

[Intro: Eladio Carrion]
Pru, what it do?
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Eladio Carrion]
How will it be, Baby? You changed cel
It was so fast, nor could I know
If I put you ahead, how are you going to grow?
I no longer 'toy for' game ', what do you think'? That this e 'Mattel?
And you keep turning in my head, Carousel
I just want to talk, if you want ', you can turn on
Below in the lobby, I left you the key to the hotel
He told me: "Before being asshole, he was born again"
And you have to do the thing 'well and not do it' to do
I still don't know if this is love or it's pleasure
I feel that if it is not sexual I don't know how to please you
She likes the movie and knows that I am Denzel
[Choir: Eladio Carrión]
She wants everything or nothing
Open book, with you do not cover anything
What I have 'linges', does not go out
Don't go 'yet, it's not' bad
Baby, it's not 'bad
Wants everything or nothing
Open book, with you do not cover anything
I still feel you in my pillow
Don't go 'yet, it's not' bad
Baby, it's not 'bad

[Verse 2: Corina Smith]
OKEY, says' that is' pa 'me
But it wasn't what I saw (ah)
Leaving the disco with another (ey)
I don't believe anything 'what comes out of your mouth (ah-ah-ah)
If I am going to lie, for the men 'do it well
I don't have 'fifty if I deserve a hundred
If it's not all, I don't want it (I want)
Better, stay with the ego (with the ego)
I think about you, I don't lie to you
But the problem is not 9-9, they are two
You speak 'a lot and the word' the wind takes them
Maybe I loved us', but it wasn't at the same time
I don't know what you want from me
If I gave everything to you

Don't tell me 'I'm bad
If only 'toy asking you to be all or nothing
Open book, with you do not cover anything
You say that he loves me, but he doesn't fit me
Makes you 'the victim and I am always bad
I know I'm bad
Wants everything or nothing
Open book, with you do not cover anything
I still feel you in my pillow
Don't go 'yet, it's not' bad
Baby, it's not 'bad

[Outro: Corina Smith]
I don't know what you want from me
I don't know what you want from me
I don't know what you want from me
I don't know what you want from me4embed
