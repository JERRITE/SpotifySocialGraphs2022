#Monkeybars Lyrics[Intro: Cal Scruby]
I know you listen every project
Never get the concept
Content too complex, too conscious
Converse context too much to process
All you do is talk shit

[Verse 1: Eazy Mac]
Yeah
It's Eazy, young Frank Sinatra
My car self parks while I drink a vodka
My weed comes from space, you can taste the star dust
I will always win is my favorite mantra (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
You should never play with monsters
You'll end up in a lake or a basement locker
What's on my plate? Steak and eggs and lobsters
What's on this plate? Some amazing pasta
So much food on my chinny-chin-chin
They get in a bad mood when I'm winning-win-win (Yeah)
Sad news for you kiddy-kid-kids
Thinking that you can't lose now it's really grim-grim
Thinking that you're Swae Lee but you're really Slim Jim
Or JayZ but you're really his kids
You're not a boss, I designed the business
You can suck my cock I reply to bitches, and
When you see the size of this dick
It's scientific, not science-fiction
It can touch the clouds yeah the sky's the limits
Plus it's good for you like a vitamin is (Yeah)
They all know I'm high and different (Yeah-yeah)
Never had to try to fit in (No-no)
Raised by Family Guy and Simpsons (Wait)
Wayfair told me buy this infant
Woah-woah-woah-woah, don't go there
Nose hairs burned down from the coke shared
With a groupie in Saint Louis, now we're both staring (Yeah)
Out the window without blinking, thinking thinking, thinking (Think)
All these little pills keep on falling on me (Whoa)
Pick 'em up nice and then call the lobby
(We need more sprite and halal salami)
Lay down now, eat my sausage mommy, ahh
[Bridge]
The money, the power, the gold (The gold)
I've come to devour the vault (The vault)
Roll with a pack of the wolves (The wolves)
You do not matter the most (No)
All of my enemies hoes (Hoes)
We make 'em ghosts (Ghosts)
Slay them like David with stones (Stones)
Get in the spaceship and psew

[Verse 2: Cal Scruby]
Off we go as the rocky roads
The road get rocky, running out of coffee, blow, and Vyvanse
By chance can you spot me though?
Until my soul gets sold, I'll be awfully broke
There's a moral to the story that cannot be told
About the ones on top, how they copied flows
From the rapper that's hot in the spot below
I'll take anybody beef, make a sloppy joe
Okay, take another look at the menu
Never sold out but I sell out the venue
Bottom of the pill bottle tell what I've been through
So every day, I wonder if I wanna continue
Bitches on my telephone tell me to send nudes
I can't now, I'm playing Nintendo with ten dudes
And I'm off of the benzo
My friend Drew's dad got a stash like Gardner Minshew
Long hair looking like a porn star now
I could prolly get a foreign car now just to make 'em say wow
Cal really got his shit together
Least a fucking drug addict but he's rich forever
And it's crazy, his car got crimson leather
He got customs plates, they let him pick the letters
He got a dick implant, the bigger the better
The only girl he can fit in like six foot seven, man look
I know you listen every project
Never get the concept
Content too complex, too conscious
Converse context too much to process
All you do is talk shit, little bitchYou might also likeEmbed
