[Verse 1: Lauren (Dinah live)]
Pack your bags we're about to go
Further than you'll ever know
Close your eyes and just make a wish
I'll give you something you can't resist
[Pre-Chorus: Camila, with Ally]
I wanna take you where you've never been, never been
I wanna take you where you've never been before
I wanna take you where you've never been, never been
I wanna take you where you've never been before

[Chorus: Ally]
We're fallin' down, fallin' down, fallin' down to the floor
Keep tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me that I'm yours
I'm whatcha been, whatcha been, whatcha been waiting for
Keep tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me that I'm yours

[Post-Chorus: All & Ally]

[Verse 2: Normani & Camila]
Take your head and just breathe it in
Baby, know when you're feeling it
Don't be shy, baby, follow me
Trust me, boy, I'll be all you need (Oh, ooh)
