[Chorus: Billie Essco & Westside Gunn]
Look, I swear that it will be prayed by Paris (they will pray for)
Off-white unpublished to the ankles, ayy (ankles)
I am in those places you can't go (to which you can't go)
Don C, nigo in the same row, ayy (the same row)
I swear that it will pray in Paris
I need Casablanca for the number of charges (charges, BRR)
Silks with oranges and mangoes (mangoes)
Now I'm a model, baby, I have a face for that, ayy (face for that)
I swear to pray in Paris (ayy, me)
[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
I like old nashes, on the cocaine style
Anyone who moves, we mark the fingers of the feet (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
My 327 were blessings, leather Vuitton vests
I have a firearm loaded in the headquarters of Mercedes, Mr. Stressing (Skrrt)
Twenty -two with gray hair, there are twenty -five in the cage
I told him to hold his head, it's worse in a grave
I threw cocaine in the pot, I saw it bloom as a residue and consume
He began to greet, had a lighter and a drug spoon
A black tries to kill you for your recipe
My nasal style shoots strongly, dodging my third serious crime (ah)
Take your brightness, 2x5, me and mine
Fleeing in a suit and tie, you say that you are the most flying, so who am I?
Balenciaga with heel, lemonada a popular drink still
Vlone jacket liked, so I know real (ah)
About pots, I'm too exquisite
On the dance floor trying to fuck with the fingers on each visit
Some blacks will never risk
Jumping from the BM, I'm proud of my position (Skrrt)
They never had a pot to urinate
Body parts in Cavalli dishes
In Mulholland in the Gota of the Wild Porsche, my crocodile moccasins
Stylizing, I will have larger visions (ah)
You can realize the way they handle it
You get money, then the enemies are with him
It's not dry, I told them to wait a minute (ah)
I praise both for the way I did

I swear that it will be prayed by Paris (they will pray for)
Off-white unpublished to the ankles, ayy (ankles)
I am in those places you can't go (to which you can't go)
Don C, nigo in the same row, ayy (the same row)
I swear that it will pray in Paris
I need Casablanca for the number of charges (charges, Badmon)
Silks with oranges and mangoes (mangoes, yes, yes, yes)
I am now a model, baby, I have a face for that, ayy (face for that, yes, yes, yes)
I swear that it will pray in Paris

[Verse 2: Joey Bada $$]
I am from an era of hard blows and quiet storms (SHH)
Rap songs on crack and firearms (bah, bah, bah, bah)
In the hiding place of some shit of Money Mitch (Woo)
Adjust the air conditioning, hid the cookie (yes)
It's your life, you can choose to risk it if you want
These blacks don't want to smoke, they want some marijuana
They threw me class only for my aroma
I went to high school, I forgot to collect my diploma (I was drugged)
That is when we used to encrypt Arizonas (UH-HU)
Now I'm in that Maybach, I'm with Puff and Hova (Acts, Woo, Woo)
We fold the corners in the Six-Douce
I talk about Pétrus bottles of ten thousand dollars last night, bébelo as if it were juice, friend
How could I lose?
The shit that these fools will do to be in my place, I have finished following the rules
I learned from OG, I'm withdrawing jewels
Everything is simple Jane, different day, the same
I mean, it is common
Everything that is new to you is the type of shit to which I am accustomed
I care about the shit of the haters, I'm used to
If they shit, then I know that the feeling is mutual (bitch)
[Chorus: Billie Essco & Joey Bada $$]
I swear that it will be prayed by Paris (they will pray for)
Off-white unpublished to the ankles, Ayy (he is the young Bada $$, ankles)
I am in those places you can't go (yes, yes, yes, you can't go to)
Don C, nigo in the same row, ayy (the same row)
I swear that it will pray in Paris
I need Casablanca for the number of charges (charges)
Silks with oranges and mangoes (mangoes)
Now I'm a model, baby, I have a face for that, ayy (face for that)
I swear that it will pray in Paris

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
If you are feeling good
So everyone says yes, yes (yes)
Yes, yes (feeling good)
Yes, yes (I'm in my shit of Gunn)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitch, I'm all that, all that, Kenan, Kel (Kel)
When I enter, blacks play, they touch the bells (bells)
Roses at my feet, blacks kneel, the dogs shout
Gloss in my neck coincides with the brightness on my nails (ayy, me)
Blacks always have something to say, well, they fuck
The same types were powerful until they got to bent
We have the records and we throw ourselves
They play chicken, we cackle
I am Colonel Sanders for your bitch children
Black garbage and pull (uh), I've been rapping and fucking (yes)
He is 6'5 ", I am a dwarf, and we accelerate the disco (dance)
This car came with a driver, I'm in the back playing "Frontin '"
I'm not crying, the wind is flying, stop making assumptions
I'm not lying or anything
Yes, I'm, I'm so happy
I turned nothing into something, the skin shining, my hair in diapers
My health is good, my mother is good, my blacks too
And they just want to have good moments like Josh Safdie
We eat well, far from maccas hamburgers
A long way from that subway bus taxi service
Long road, crazy gangs tried taxidermia (where are you from, black?)
We ran until our damn backs were burning, uh
But anyway, short shorts and high socks
And the emeralds shine in those GQS and those popeyes (boy)
And spring with my private eye that you tried
You can't take this look, black, it's not me

[Chorus: Billie Essco]
I swear that it will be prayed by Paris (they will pray for)
Off-white unpublished to the ankles, ayy (ankles)
I am in those places you can't go (to which you can't go)
Don C, nigo in the same row, ayy (the same row)
I swear that it will pray in Paris
I need Casablanca for the number of charges (charges)
Silks with oranges and mangoes (mangoes)
Now I'm a model, baby, I have a face for that, ayy (face for that)
I swear that it will be prayed by Parismbed
