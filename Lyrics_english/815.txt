TranslationEnglishlejos with me lyrics [letter from "far with me"]

[Verse 1: Greeicy]
If my eyes already kissed you, what do we need
What are your mouth and mine too?
I can't take me anymore, you have high pressure
And in the midst of so many people, I don't know what to do

[Chorus: Greeicy & Alejandro Sanz]
You should go far, but far with me
To see if it happens to us or I stay with you
You should go far, but far with me
Because having you close without kissing you a punishment
[Verse 2: Alejandro Sanz]
Behind your RÐµvuel
And although your hand in mine does not know how to lose (mmm)
I hope to look at your lip, kill me
In the midst of so many people, I don't know what to do

[Verse 3: Alejandro Sanz]
That it is not going to be that we leave the time
I don't want this to end in regret
Although what happens is the wind
Let's take advantage that tomorrow we don't know and since we are here

[Chorus: Greeicy & Alejandro Sanz]
You should go far, but far with me
To see if it happens to us or I stay with you
You should go far, but far with me
Because having you close without kissing you is a punishment

[Bridge: Greeicy & Alejandro Sanz]
If my eyes already kissed you, what do we need?
What I want is to know what your skin knows
I can't take me anymore, you have high pressure
Give me the key to the sky and I lock myself in your being

[Chorus: Greeicy & Alejandro Sanz]
You should go far, but far with me
To see if it happens to us or I stay with you
You should go far, but far with me
Because having you close without kissing you is a punishment

To see if it happens to us or I stay with you
