Adversity LyricsWill you tear it down?
Will you decide?
We put up a fight for the other side

Raise up our arms to show we’re strong
They may break out bones
But we’ll carry on

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity?
All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me
Adversity?

Oh, the call to move it in
Oh, we’re all so new to it

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity?

All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me
Adversity?You might also likeEmbed
