Bad Bite Lyrics[Verse 1]
Celebrate
I've got a back pocket full of riffs
If you stick around I'll let you see them all
'Cause some fires can't be unlit
Celebrate
Love is a fickle beast with fiscal immunities
Should I get out before I drown?
Do you kiss your mother with that ugly mouth?

[Pre-Chorus]
Celebrate
We are one and the same
I think we sing the very same song
We are one and the same
I think we sing the very same song
[Chorus]
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, honey
You just love me for my riffs
Come on

[Verse 2]
We've got plenty of time for death
In a later-on episode
But for now it's just time to dance
Celebrate
I don't claim to have the answers all
I might disagree when I'm dead and gone
But for now the old saying goes
You gotta do what you love the most

[Pre-Chorus]
Celebrate
We are one and the same
I think we sing the very same song
We are one and the same
I think we sing the very same song
You might also like[Chorus]
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth
We're just bones and teeth

[Bridge]
I got the feeling that I can't go home
But I can't go out and I cannot stay here
I got the feeling that I can't go home
I can't go out and I cannot stay here
I got the feeling that I can't go home
But I can't go out, I cannot stay here
I got the feeling that I can't go home
I got the feeling that I can't go

[Outro]
We're just bones and teeth
That's a recordEmbed
