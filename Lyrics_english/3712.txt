That’s too bad
No wonder my heart hurts
I went through a hard time
I made a lot of efforts
That’s too bad
No wonder I had an upset stomach
You did a good job
You worked hard

[Pre-Chorus 1: Hwa Sa]
You’re talented, doing it like a bear
You’re the only one who stays up all night sowing seeds
That cunning one get
Steal my thunder wack
[Chorus: Hwa Sa]
I'm bad too (I'm bad too)
It’s all ruined anyway
Just leave it to flow on
I'm bad too (I'm bad too)
Are flower roads the only roads?
Comfortably play and fall asleep yeah

[Post-Chorus: Hwa Sa & DPR LIVE]
I'm bad (She’s bad)
You're so bad (She’s so sad)
But we are young
(The night’s too young for you to be frowning like that)
Young

[Verse 2: DPR LIVE]
COMING TO YOU LIVE
Come here, HwaSa
Who shot these arrows?
Who made you mad?
Who is it, bring them
Let me teach him some
I’m going crazy seriously (ah ah!)
I’mm a give him that drama (ah ah!)
If you’re frowning with that pretty face
Do you think I’d be angry or not?

But what she needs is
Oh, you had a rough day? Well, me too…
But, it’s a relief you’re here
Because HwaSa’s here
I’m bad too
IITE COOL

[Chorus: Hwa Sa & DPR LIVE]
I'm bad too (I’m sad too)
It’s all ruined anyway yeah
Just leave it to flow on
I'm bad too (I’m sad too)
Are flower roads the only roads? yeah
Comfortably play and fall asleep

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I'm bad
You're so bad
But we are young
