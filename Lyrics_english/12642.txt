Little Bastards Lyrics[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I've been losing my mind
Running out of faith (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Lonely, I've been feeling lonely
Put me in my place (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
[Verse 1]
Twist and fade
Time to run away, I can't take this
I've been a little patient
No escape
I've got to get away a little faster
Run, you little bastards
Run, run, you little bastards

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake friends all around
They watch while I drown
No one is there to help me

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I've been losing my mind
Running out of faith (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Lonely, I've been feeling lonely
Put me in my place (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
So fuck you, I don't even like you
I'm sick of all the fake (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
No sleep, got another nosebleed
I can't feel my face (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You might also like[Verse 2]
I've shut my mouth
While you prance around in my jumpsuit
Aw, that's so cute (So cute)
No escape
I've got to get away a little faster (Faster)
Run, you little bastards
Run, run, you little bastards

[Pre-Chorus]
Fake friends all around
They watch while I drown
No one is there to help me

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I've been losing my mind
Running out of faith (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Lonely, I've been feeling lonely
Put me in my place (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
So fuck you, I don't even like you
I'm sick of all the fake (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
No sleep, got another nosebleed
I can't feel my face (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
[Outro]
Twist and fade
Time to run away a little faster
Run, you little bastards
Run, run, you little bastards
Run, run, you little bastards
Run, run a little faster
