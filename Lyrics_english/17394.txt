Monsieur Dior Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a problem showin' someone love and not gettin' it back
It's easy to love when my love not attached
Plenty fishes in the sea but none of 'em a catch
My head got my ego high and twelve on my ass
My feelings on my shoulders with my hands countin' the cash
My niggas gettin' money but they only get it fast
I used to run in stores, just to claim I'm poppin' tags
And when we run in bitches, it's a smash, never grab, yeah
I would hit them licks and then I dip across the Ave'
I ain't have no crib so I would hit 'em in the trap
Niggas talkin' shit, see, that's the only timе I laugh
I got a problem showin' people lovе that I never had
[Chorus]
Got so many problems, fuck the jail, fuck the judge, fuck the bail, fuck the law
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (Yah)
Got so many problems that I prayed to the Lord and I prayed to Allah
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (Yah)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' like (Yeah), I'm feelin' like (Yeah)
I need to hit the switches for the ceilin' light
The room is kinda dark, I'm tryna get it bright
I'm lookin' at the clock because it's takin' time
It's tickin', tickin'
Back when Tigg was in the basement, I was sittin', chillin' (Uh-huh)
I was studyin' the greatness, I was sittin' witness (Uh-huh)
Niggas flexin' with they necklace, it was really fitness (Yeah, yeah)
Back and forth, I'm contemplatin' like I'm playin' tennis
I'm just tryna see me finish, everything I said that I would do
I'm tryna fix my image, confident, I'm never timid
They still tryna judge me for my past while my problem showin' people love that I never had
Was raised by the wolves, wasn't raised by my fam'
Rest in peace to my mama and my dad

[Chorus]
So many problems, fuck the jail, fuck the judge, fuck the bail, fuck the law
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (Yah)
Got so many problems that I prayed to the Lord and I prayed to Allah
In the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior, in the name of Dior (Yah)
