Waiting (Demo) Lyrics[Verse]
Feel like forever
Time slowing by
Anticipating
When you're more than in my mind
It can't be measured
A feeling like
I would give up everything just to call you mine
'Cause

[Chorus]
I'll stay waitin' for you
Any-anything, I'll do it all for you
Baby, I'll stay waitin' for you
I'll stay waitin' for you, yeah
Anything you wanted, I would do it all for you
I'll stay waitin' for you
[Outro]
