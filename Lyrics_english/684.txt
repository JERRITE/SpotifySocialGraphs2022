And thus zero heart 'broken
Make love with another
And that is between us'
You ere 'mine without papers (ey)
And thus zero heart 'broken

To 'the day in mine,' Toy well lit '
They left me alone and screwed to '(he fucked to')
I set the ferra and takeoff from the earth (OH)
Make me love, not war (Brrum)
