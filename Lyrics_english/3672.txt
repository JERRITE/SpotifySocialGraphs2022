You’re Sexy I’m Sexy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not saying you should get too comfortable
But if you wanna slip your coat off
Baby, that'd be fine with me
I'm not saying, "Let your inhibitions go"
But if you wanna sip this vodka
Wouldn't be a crime to me

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be simple as, it could be simple as
Loving on each other with no strings
It could be simple as, it could be simple as
We got more in common than you think
[Chorus]
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
We all need somebody
And mine is right here for you
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
If you want somebody on your body
I'll be somebody to you

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I'm not here to be the judge or testify
Oh baby, we can't break the law
If we don't ever lay it down
We're not here to find some kind of love tonight
But when you whisper little nothings
Girl, I love the way it sounds, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be simple as, it could be simple as
Loving on each other with no strings
It could be simple as, it could be simple as
We got more in common than you think
You might also like[Chorus]
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
We all need somebody
And mine is right here for you
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
If you want somebody on your body
I'll be somebody to you

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
And it could be simple as that
Playing without strings attached
Holding without holding back
And it could be simple as, simple as

[Chorus]
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
We all need somebody
And mine is right here for you
You're sexy, I'm sexy
You want me, I want you too
If you want somebody on your body
I'll be somebody to you
[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh2Embed
