Lakes. Lyrics[Intro: Obi]
Thought I looked and saw a photo of my life
Not four years before I turned five, that’s enough
When you truly know the nature of our lives
It’ll be way past our all our primes, what a bust

[Verse 1: Phantom]
I’ve been seeing eyes but they just whispered in my head
We'll never truly kick it 'til the bucket at the end
Fuck, I need a drink, I need a bump, I need a bend
I need a... I guess I need a next
Still you talking like you know me
That’s the perks of growing up, never know until it's done
The greatest enemy is the person in your life
That makes you think that when you grow up all your shit will be all right
Could be a mother or a father or a sister
Usually a lover, never thought that you could miss but
Aiming’s getting tough when you've been aiming for a missed shot
I guess this growing up is just the painting on the picture
[Hook: Phantom]
And I'll drink 'til my liver gets cirrhosis
And I’ve been thinking it's something that you should notice
From all this calling out, deaf ears are just a lotus
And I'll just drink until my liver gets cirrhosis
I need some balance, need some truth
I need to go with
I need to go with

[Verse 2: Obi]
And I'll just drink 'til my liver gets cirrhosis
And my wife gets a call from a room
I’m just lying in, no need to lie to the family
We just dying, man
I need some balance, I need some truth, I need some vitamins
I need some guidance, I'm just sick of all the lying, man
I’m sick of all the lying, man

[Verse 3: Phantom]
Could’ve been the twenty hours I was closed lip
Did you even notice, it's notable
Never needed your help
Or did I lie to myself
It's easy tryna cope
When you deny that you're alone
Forgetting times, I got too fucked up drinking wine
And calling phones I knew would not reply
Or even give me the time, just to swipe to the right
A little message or line, I think I'm losing my…

It's all good
Forgetting times, on time again
It's all good
'Cause I’ma smash a fucking bottle
And I'll drink 'til hallelujah
Fucking forty days left praying
Just to fall upon a new star
It's all good, it's all good

[Hook: Phantom]
And I'll drink 'til my liver gets cirrhosis
And I’ve been thinking it's something that you should notice
From all this calling out, deaf ears are just a lotus
And I'll just drink until my liver gets cirrhosis
I need some balance, need some truth
I need to go with
I need to go with3Embed
