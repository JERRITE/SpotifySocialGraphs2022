St. Louis Elegy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look at the sky
I see an airplane as it flies
Is this the way they said Jesus came?
Gone through St. Louis
Gone straightaway
Now I hear the winter will cut you quick
If tears were liquor, I'd have drunk myself sick

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Woman are you home?
A house of cards, a frame of bones
Here I am, earthly bound
Said "Hallelujah, I'm going down"
And the River Jordan is deep and wide
I think I see forever, oh, across on the other side

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I look at the sky
I see a night bird as it flies
Over the old bent cherry trees
Shivering in a row
Down here, the winter will cut you quick
These tears are liquor, oh yeah, and I've drunk myself sick

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Coda]
And the dead of winter will cut you quick
These tears are liquor, and I've drunk myself sickYou might also like2Embed
