Things You Can’t Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've tied it back
And you’ve worn it down
You've dyed it blonde
But your roots are brown
And you've asked me now
A thousand times
What I prefer ’cause you can't decide

[Refrain]
The truth is whatever you do I, ooh, I know
There'll be no changing my mind
[Chorus]
'Cause I want you for the worse and for the better
It's all you do but you don't realize
Yeah, I love you for you, babe
For all the things you can't change

[Verse 2]
You won't sit still
And you’re always late
And you talk through films
But I like the way you say what’s on your mind
Even when you try to stop yourself
Can you tell that

[Chorus]
I want you for the worse and for the better
It's all you do but you don’t realize
Yeah, I love you for you, babe
For all the things you can't change
Yeah, I love you for you, babe, yeah
For all the things you can't change

[Refrain]
The truth is whatever you do I, ooh, I know
There'll be no changing my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
’Cause I want you for the worse and for the better
It's all you do but you don't realize
Yeah, I love you for you, babe
For all the things you can't change
I love you for you, baby
For all the things you can't change
I love you for you, baby
For all the things you can't changeEmbed
