Bad choosing lyrics ["bad letter choosing"]

[Verse 1]
I'm going to look for you to take you pa'l mall
Vamo 'of Shoppin', will make you feel better
Take that idea and be faithful
He doesn't love you like you, his heart is paper
He gives you fifty, you give him 'the hundred (one hundred)
Knows that you did the wax and you don't see
Although he steals his smile, you die 'for that man
There is something of him that you hide '
[Pre-car]
Maybe e 'the custom
They say that I lack that love
Once I was like that, but I could see the sun
A vece 'vemo' thing 'that are not
Butterfly 'in the air and that e' the error

[Chorus]
Maybe ere 'bad choosing
You let yourself go for the moment
He does not want to sleep alone, I understand that
But you have to give time to time (OH, OH-OH)
Maybe ere 'bad choosing

He does not want to sleep alone, and I understand that
But you have to give time to time

To laugh at your joke ', he
And he will arrive because he gave it to him
Looking for holiday love

Incorrect 'decisive' tired '
Bed in bed looking for the answer (but)

While 'so much, get pretty
I want to see that loquita again
That does not make up, do not need it

You deserve everything I would like '
