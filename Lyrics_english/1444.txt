Insomnia (King Topher Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
Ah, ah, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
Ah, ah, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

Ah, ah, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
I got, I got, I got

Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)You might also likeEmbed
