Mayday lyrics [Login: Patron & Ati242]
2-4-2
(Zwei, Vier, Zwei, Wouh)

[Verse 1: Ati242 & Boss]
2-4-2 Flow, Boss, My Breath Bronze
O.G. Oh Shit! Bi 'Porsche and "Boss Shit!"
Mayday, Mayday Blowjob every day
Mayday every day mail, sekmez album concert
Mayday Street, Poster Hanged, O!
Accept me, you know me!
You scanned it
I know, they talk to me (yeah)
It becomes a ceiling from my life (Skkra), there is always parasites
I have a collar among the legs
Manitas from my wet note printing, money flow
Style Conor McGregor (EY)
Çavolar get used to, digga (EY)
Then burn the gang
"So läuft das tijara immer!" (Article)
It doesn't matter, red lilac (EY), it works paramatic (O)
Manita Asa Akira
Machinery, cash, Sativa, Sapphire, Ey
[Bridge: Ati242 & Boss]
Looking for buddies
Mayday asks the wave
I guess there is no end for Mayday, Mayday, Mayday
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday or (Msayday, Mayday, Mayday)
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday
(Zwei, Vier, Zwei, Wouh!)

The heart is still snow (snow)
I can't give me relevance
I could never laugh (kah, kah)
Kah hasn't dried still blood
Your Raps Playback ha (ha)
My coups to the brain (or)
Czech pull it, stay like that
We Kartal You Stork ha
Article! Some of them are new on the table
Their lies come to their mouth (O)
My tenant gives cash in my house
My Cash car is under me
I write every night your word cash
I take it, it's time to lose
I fly, of course, I'm also a minute
Jordan and Nike (fuck it) on me
This is not my table, you ate wasabi
When the money is over, you are poor again
He doesn't like that city without money
Let me take it away before the nervous microphone dies
The cops are full on my way
If we go to the stupid,
We hang out in the corner secretly
If we opened him or to Munchies (son)

We have a ignorance, the world is not fair to us
