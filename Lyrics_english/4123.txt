Why do you leave Lyrics [lyrics of "why you leave" ft. Cali and the Dandee]

[Chorus: Tini]
I promise not cry, wait for you and not forget
Give me a last kiss to make me dream
And this shout of pain will never silence this love
I prefer to live waiting to accept that you are not
I love you so much love, you don't know how much, love
Because you are leaving?

[Verse 1: Cali and the dandee]
Why did you forget the reasons to be here?
Why did you leave the words I wanted to tell you?
They already told me to forget you
That time heals you and continues, but you are still here
They already told me that love does not kill but it hurts you
And it hurts so much that you die inside
I don't care if you don't love me
And even if you left, I want you to stay
[Choir: Tini, Cali and Dandee, both]
I promise not cry (not cry)
Wait for you and not forget (don't forget)
Give me a last kiss to make me dream (let me dream)
And this shout of pain (of pain)
You will never shut up this love (oh, oh)
I prefer to live waiting to accept that you are not
I love you so much love, you don't know how much, love
Because you are leaving? Why are you leaving, why you're leaving (uh, oh)
Because you are leaving? Why are you leaving, why you're leaving (uh, oh)

[Verse 2: Cali and the Dandee]
There was such a big vacuum when you left
False promises and dreams that no longer exist
Eternal summer, springs in winter
I neglected the flame of love and became hell
I can't stop and still try
It wasn't my fault and I still say "I'm sorry"
I am not enough
I feel that among so many people
I chose to fall in love with the one that the wind takes, oh

[Choir: Tini, Cali and Dandee, both]
I promise not cry (not cry)
Wait for you and not forget (don't forget)
Give me a last kiss to make me dream (let me dream)
And this shout of pain (of pain)
You will never shut up this love (oh, oh)
I prefer to live waiting to accept that you are not
I love you so much love, you don't know how much, love
Because you are leaving? Why are you leaving, why you're leaving (uh, oh)
Because you are leaving? Why are you leaving, why you're leaving (uh, oh)

I prefer to live waiting to accept that you are not
I love you so much love, you don't know how much, love
Because you are leaving?
