Pandora Lyrics [Words of "Pandora"]

[Verse 1: Lazer]
What are the bays?
I'm on Namek, I see spikes on the net
You see it works and suddenly, you want to get started
Far from here, I launch my worries on the TEC '
They want my skin, they want my cash, they want to me
They are not clear, clear, net
I take my head, head, head
Petit Sourou does not want us to love him but want to do the money
I spit my hatred and they want more
Gang has the slab, I agree that I have time for the war of the bands
I bite the designer and then I put in the ashes
18 rods on pandora, I'm in legend
[Refrain: Moha]
Big, on namek, we receive spikes on the net
They want the buzz, they want my loss, they want to put it on me
They are not clear, clear, net
They will come to shoot us
They want their head, head, head
We are in Tess', Tess', Tess'
We want tickets, tickets, tickets, tickets, we
Shout, scream, cry, scream "zoo"
Sawn, sawn, sawn, sawn, blows
Asyezyeyezzyez-go you

[Verse 2: Moha]
Yeah with us the tits-pole do the Z
When it's shit, you have to bicrave the cess'
Yeah big at my age, I have the experience of your father
That shit rappers, I stop careers
Respect the microbes, kill Zé Pequ '
Take out the sawn cannon, fuck your pec '
Bang, Bang, Bang
I see your spikes on the net, I sore like Vegeta
You said it's your halal, today she gets crai '
Ien-cli number on macadam
Benave Hebs, release Brams
I'm not your halal, sorry ladies
I stop, I stop then I start again
Get into dance, I'm in a showcase throughout France
There are only the real ones who know that I am true
Your clique likes me, your go it sells, askip 'I'm fresh
Your go te michtonne for bcbg
I was told "Moha must kiss them"
Increase the volume, I don't want you to lower
No I don't cet, I don't have the bg, bg
On my life, this year we fuck them
That nightmares, I did not reach my dreams
Spells on my nose, I sore like Vegeta
I want to take the universe, yeah I want everything I have not
Tarterêts at the top, tartets at the top
I left the foot of my turn, I still do not find sleep
You see the gang in danger, courage you will have
We left the tower, we are on Pandora

Big, on namek, we receive spikes on the net
They want the buzz, they want my loss, they want to put it on me
They are not clear, clear, net
They will come to shoot us
They want their head, head, head
We are in Tess', Tess', Tess'
We want tickets, tickets, tickets, tickets, we
Shout, scream, cry, scream "zoo"
Sawn, sawn, sawn, sawn, blows
Asyezyeyezzyez-go you

[Outro]
We want tickets, tickets, tickets, tickets, we
Shout, scream, cry, scream "zoo"
Sawn, sawn, sawn, sawn, blows
Asyyezeyezzyez-test you3embed
