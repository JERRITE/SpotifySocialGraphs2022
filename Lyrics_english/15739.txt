You can not be lyricsal for time, maybe I forget you 
 But this time I learned that you should not lie 
 Of a vivi promise 
 Today I can't keep believing in you 
 Every moment I stumble upon a step 
 And there is nothing left between you and me 
 If I'm crying, it's not missing your heart 
 Is that by your side I learned the pain 
 You can't forget that I love you as I never imagine 
 I will be on your skin every moment where you are 
 There will always be a place 
 Some memory that will be an eternal sighyou might also likembed
