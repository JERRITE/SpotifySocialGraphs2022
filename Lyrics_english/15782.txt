Innocent poor friend Lyricste you seem so much to me
You can't fool me
Nothing earns with lying
Better tell me the truth
I know you are leaving me
And I know very well for who you do

You think I don't realize
What happens is that I no longer want
More problems with your love
What are you going to go with her
Okay I don't oppose
I wish you be happy
But I'm going to warn you
What do you come back again
I do not answer

You think I don't

I know a silly
You want
And that I fell in love with you
I know that the two

They are understood
And that the two laugh at me
You think I didn't realize
Well, it's not like that

I have been
And I never told you anything
And despite your betrayal
I gave you the opportunity
What will you reconsider

You think I didn't realize
What happens is that no longer
I wanted more problems with your love
You might also like that dumb
You want
And that I fell in love with you
You don't know what awaits you
And think it's going happy
Innocent poor friend
You don't know what will suffer

About notice there is no deception
And I know very well that today you go
Tell that one who loves you today
That to love you nothing more
That for that she lacks
What I have more

You seem so much to me
You can't fool me
