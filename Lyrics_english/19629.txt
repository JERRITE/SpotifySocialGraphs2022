All For The Show LyricsBitch I’m Mr. Jones
Alley way and chaplain
Dark side of the moon
Light side of the shadows den
Junkies on the move
Working for this Madeline
This is Carter 2
Prequel to the happening

H Town chop and screwed
Ey
Midwest mix consumed
Ey
This is where you doomed
Ey
This is where you lose
Ey
Play the part so well
Ey
Woke up in the cell
Ey
Chains all on my belt
Ey
Preconditioned nails
Ey

Bank on fade but it’s
All for the show
Oh
Late to the banquet
It’s all for the show
Ay

Moss on the paint
All for the show
Ey

Grace in a maze hey
All for the show



You might also likeAll by myself
This how I find myself
Fibonacci knocking with the tchotsky deposit
Common sense lost
That’s how I found my self
(Common sense lost that’s how I found my cell)

Tried to break the lock but accelerated hell
The truth is so reclusive when your wish is in a well

Hey

Only time’ll tell

Who knew to ring a bell you had to utilize your will

Now it’s all a choice when before it was fail

Now it’s all a choice when before it was oh well

Maybe it’ll sell
Maybe it’ll meld
Maybe it’ll fall right in my lap without a tale

I blame my world when I chase my tail
I feign my grail when I race myself
Cuz saying I’m Nell tryna dodge that Quilp
Is a understated thought shipped and written through the mail
So i do what I felt
Tread through the silt
Slip through the slit
Rip bits off the pelt

Cast my wayward soul to the shale
And pinch my chips just the face yourself

True
