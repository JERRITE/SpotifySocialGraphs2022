Never Not Sunday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fight with me if you want me to die
Whisper your words like a river, go lightly
I was born in the middle of night
All of my ancestors walking behind me

[Chorus]
To the dreams I know now as a lie
The wandering life never seemed like a goodbye
To the land I once knew as a boy
I ran through the light, it was never not Sunday
Moments made in the shadows of joy
As long as I'm living, I'll find you there someday
[Verse 2]
Hi, I wanted to tell you my age
Dip my toe in the universe, matey
Feelings likе this were nevеr the same
When I found out that the world could not hide me
Now the time is a weight on my wrist
All of my hearts have wandered off without me

[Refrain]
To the land I once knew as a boy
I ran through the light, it was never not Sunday
Moments made in the shadows of joy
As long as I'm living, I'll find you there someday

[Bridge]
And I was striding like a world-weary worthy winner
But I was a life beginner
And I was hoping for some magic before my dinner
Open eyes and see the glimmer go
Vanishing before I could know

[Chorus]
Oh, the dreams I know now as a lie
The wandering life never seemed like a goodbye
To the land I once knew as a boy
I ran through the light, it was never not Sunday
Moments made in the shadows of joy
As long as I'm living, I'll find you there someday

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh)
As long as I'm living, I'll find you there someday
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh)
As long as I'm living, I'll find you there somedayEmbed
