Sweet Talk Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I’m up late and lonely
When I’m just down to hoping
Know what I want to hear from you
When the doubt pulls me under
And I need to recover
Know what I want to hear from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Say baby, say to me
The words that keep me goin’
Yeah, I know you know ‘em
Say baby, say to me
The words to make me heal
I love the way they feel
[Chorus]
You give me some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk
You give me some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk
Say it again 'cause I need it
Sounding so good know you mean it
Some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk to me

[Verse 2: Rizky Febian]
When my conscience is breaking
And its fear that I’m facing
Know what I wanna hear from you
When the clouds fill the sky up
Know what I can rely on
Know what I wanna hear from you

[Pre-Chorus: Sheryl Sheinafia & Rizky Febian]
Say baby, say to me
The words that keep me goin’
Yeah, I know you know ‘em
Say baby, say to me
The words to make me heal
I love the way they feel
You might also like[Chorus: Sheryl Sheinafia & Rizky Febian]
You give me some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk
You give me some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk
Say it again 'cause I need it
Sounding so good know you mean it
Some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk to me

[Verse 3: Chandra Liow]
I’m feelin so stuck, gridlock
Gimme some of that uh, sweet talk
I’ve been up all night gettin' so blue
But here comes you to the rescue
How did you do it? Imma dead-lock
Gotta figure it out, Imma be like Sherlock
Wait, I don’t need to know
You don’t need to show
And just keep ‘em words flow

[Bridge]
Oh I love, oh I love
That sweet talk baby (gimme some of that)
Oh I love, oh I love

Oh I love, oh I love

[Chorus: Sheryl Sheinafia & Rizky Febian]
You give me some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk (sweet sweet talk)
You give me some of that, some of that (hey)
Sweet sweet talk
Say it again 'cause I need it, ('cause I need it)
Sounding so good know you mean it (mean it)
Some of that, some of that
Sweet sweet talk to me (give it to me)

[Outro: Sheryl Sheinafia & Rizky Febian]
Oh I love, oh I love (you know that I need it)
