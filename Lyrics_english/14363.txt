Can You Hear Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like when the rain is falling on your face and wash away
The days of wondering if you should go or you should stay
Like when the noise is gone, and silence lives inside of you
And you can hear that every single thought that’s born is true

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m chasing stars
And all my, troubles fall apart
Now you can’t break my heart
At night I can live my dreams
Oh oh
Why don’t you?
[Chorus]
Can you hear me
Like glittering little words
It’s already here
Can you feel me?
Spread it throughout the world
I’m already there
Can you hear me?
(throughout the night)
Can you feel me?
(making it right)

[Verse 2]
When the night awakes and the water, the sun is falling red
Like paper planes into darkness are flying from my bed
The day is nothing, but the dews are falling to the ground
The wind in the leaves is the only thing that makes a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m chasing stars
And all my, troubles fall apart
You can’t, can’t break my heart
At night I can live my dreams

[Chorus]
Can you hear me, like glittering little words
I touch, I feel
It’s already here
I’m dreaming of you
It’s already here
Can you feel me?
Spread it throughout the world
I, I, I, I, I’m already there
Can you hear me?
(Throughout the night)
Can you feel me?
Making it right?
Can you hear me?

Crystal drops bouncing on my skin
Pearls of water running down, forbidden sounds filling the air
Breathing silently
Ai yai yai yai, ai yai yai yai, *breath*
Tinkling rhythms in isolation
I’m growing in the darkness
Steam is spilling
Breathing heavily
Ai yai yai yai, ai yai yai yai ooh

[Chorus]
Can you hear me
Whoo!
Like glittering little words
I touch, I feel
It’s already here
I’m dreaming of you, yeah
Can you feel me?
Spread it throughout the world
Dreaming of you
I’m already there
Can you hear me?
(Throughout the night)
Can you feel me?
(making it right.)
Can you hear me? yeah
Can you feel me?
[Outro]
Oh I’m already there
You know I’m already there
I’m already there
I’m already there
YeahEmbed
