​on the move Lyrics[Chorus: chevy]
I'm on the move, can't stop me if you try
Coasting on now baby, it's just me myself and I
Cause I'm on the move, every step is by design
It's only up from here 'till the moment I die

[Verse 1: zamir]
I been on the move
I never saw myself ever coming so far
Taking small steps, I was tryina find my groove
Yeah i know that I was off to a really slow start
But now I’m, running running running
Never looking back, I’m going towards where the sun is
Even if it blinds me, I’ll find peace inside
Keep my eyes on the prize 'till I’m holding it above me, above me yeah
I’m not sure exactly what the future holds
All I know is Mama told me I should always shoot for gold
And every time I'm worried I‘ll start losing hope
I’ll take one step at a time and find my way back to the road
[PreChorus: zamir]
And I’ve been on this journey now
For way too long to turn around, the sun is out
So I’ll be on the move

[Chorus: chevy]
I'm on the move, can't stop me if you try
Coasting on now baby, it's just me myself and I
Cause I'm on the move, every step is by design
It's only up from here 'till the moment I die

[Verse 2: marc indigo]
I’m still chasing the happily ever after
That’s at the end of my story, I’m anxious to turn the chapter
My yellow brick road is painted with gold (gold)
I’m gon’ have it all but trust I ain’t trading my soul (no)
And if I’m being honest, I was at the bottom, took a lot of steps
Had a little trouble with my walking, now I’m Wally west
It’s obvious that nothing's gonna slow me down
Little introvert but everybody know me now
It’s like, it’s getting kinda crazy how everything’s changing
I hope I never lose myself
Moving so fast and, tryina maintain it
Hoping I can prove my self
It’s been an uphill battle, on the road less traveled
But I know I can make it if I try
You might also like[PreChorus: zamir]
And I’ve been on this journey now
For way too long to turn around, the sun is out
So I’ll be on the move

[Chorus: chevy]
I'm on the move, can't stop me if you try
Coasting on now baby, it's just me myself and I
Cause I'm on the move, every step is by design
It's only up from here 'till the moment I die

I'm on the move, can't stop me if you try
Coasting on now baby, it's just me myself and I
Cause I'm on the move, every step is by design
It's only up from here 'till the moment I dieEmbed
