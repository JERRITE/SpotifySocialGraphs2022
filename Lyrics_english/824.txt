So in love lyrics [letter of "so in love"]

[Verse 1: Erick & Zabdiel]
Maybe you can ask yourself
What is needed tonight
To our 'life' that they have lived so much
They have seen a thousand 'Silk' colored
And when it rains you like to walk
You hug me without hurry even if you get wet
My love, ours is how it is
And it's an adventure, nothing is needed
[Chorus: Joel, Christopher & Richard]
And I'm here, so in love with you
That the night lasts a little more
The cry of a city
That see our faces the humidity
And I will do you company beyond life
I swear I will love you more

[Verse 2: Erick & Zabdiel]
The morning will not bring, ah
A new song of Alegre Birds'
My love, so and life together
Two crazy 'suddenly
Smiling at people who do not see pass (ey)

[Chorus: Joel & Christopher]
So in love (so in love, so in love)
And so the night lasts a little more (oh, a little more)
Travel by your side on the train
A difficult dream to believe

[Bridge: Richard]
UH-UH-UH, little by little the hug
Mouth -to -mouth
Breath and warm sighs, dusk
You Might Also Like [Choir: Joel & Christopher]
So in love that like this (Yeah)
The night lasts a little more (a little more, a little more)
Travel by your side on the train
A difficult dream to believe

[Outro: Richard]
Mmm, maybe I can ask you
What is needed this White Night1embed
