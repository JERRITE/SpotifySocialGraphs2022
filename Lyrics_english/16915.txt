Still In Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Eryn]
Summer night, drinking wine
By the fire, catching up
You looking good, wish I could
Tell you I was over us

[Pre-Chorus 1: Eryn, all]
But I get high every night when I'm all alone
'Cause it helps me forget that I'm feeling low
Told you I was doing fine
It’s a lie, you should know
[Chorus 1: Eryn, all]
And if you want the truth
I’m still in love with you
No matter what I do
I’m still in love with you

[Verse 2: Ben]
I tell myself I don’t care
Who you’re with, I’m losing my mind
I picture you making love to someone else
Tell me why

[Pre-Chorus 2: Richard, all]
I get drunk to shut up all these memories
Then I wake up and they come running back to me
So have your fun, give me none
I guess you’ve won, and I messed up

[Chorus 2: Richard, all]
And I'm acting a fool
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
No matter what I do
I’m still in love with you
Tell me you want me too
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
You might also like[Bridge: Elliot, all]
And it’s killing me
Endlessly, oh
‘Cause I’m bound to be
Somebody who's helplessly and desperately
Still in love

[Outro]
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
I’m still in love with you
Tell me you want me too
I’m still in love with you2Embed
