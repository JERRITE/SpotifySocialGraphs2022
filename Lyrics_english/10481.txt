Love Goes On (Palmistry Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Hannah Diamond]
How did it end up like this? (Oh-oh)
Gone with the wind like a kiss (Oh-oh)
Breaking my heart just to try (Oh-oh)
Staying alive 'til I die
Sometimes it feels like I'm missing you
Then I remember it's you

[Bridge: Hannah Diamond, Bladee and Both]
I went out tonight
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But (s)he's not like you
And I kissed his face
In a different place
And (s)he's not the one
But my love goes on
I went out tonight
I went out last night
I cried once or twice
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
'Till I met someone new
But (s)he's not like you
And I kissed his/her face
In a different place
She's not the one, my love goes on
My love goes on
[Chorus: Hannah Diamond]
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

[Verse 2: Bladee]
How can I be what you need?
Looking at you when you leave
Breaking my heart just to feel
I wanna know what is real
Maybe me, maybe
I'll let you use me baby
Made of glass, break me
She's not the one
My love goes on

[Bridge: Hannah Diamond, Bladee and Both]
I went out tonight (I went out last night)
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But (s)he's not like you
And I kissed his/her face
In a different place
And (s)he's not the one, my love goes on
I went out tonight
I went out last night
I cried once or twice
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
'Till I met someone new
But (s)he's not like you
And I kissed his/her face
In a different place
She's not the one, my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on4Embed
