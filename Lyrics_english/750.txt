Lyrics neon lights ["neon lights letter"]

[Intro]
Without wanting to steal attention wherever she arrives
I intimidating her eyes when heaven elevates me
He wants to take me to do my new girlfriend
The album seems to be her

[Chorus]
It is activated if they light it from neon
His skirt brushing my mahón
Without clothes for you see you 'better
As far as I was driving
[Saying]
Bellaquera dominates her
It is desperate for tеnerme on top
I have your medicine
In bed it is bitch and in the street it is fine
She dominates her
Is desperate to have me on top
I have your medicine
In bed it is bitch and in the street it is fine

[Chorus]
She activates if they light it from neon
His skirt brushing my mahón
Without clothes for you see you 'better
As far as I was driving

[Saying]
Bellaquera dominates her
Is desperate to have me on top
I have your medicine
In bed it is bitch and in the street it is fine

[Verse 1]
Life was made to enjoy it
She climbed her skirt
He told me: "Daddy, don't get you '"
Pa'l cold I brought fendi the scarf
You shut up if I kiss you in the back
Going down the sudor's drops
I hit the wall, one perreated me
Mommy, tell your ex to keep your role
If you don't want to have the night 'night
They go for the album na 'more' to look at it
I am always with mine 'merodeing the area
She wants to get out of the daily routine
She is not afraid, she is reckless

[Verse 2]
The lights make that panty highlight
Partner, if you are not dancing with her, jump
If you want 'I send to' the bouncer to get you
Pa 'She on the weekend to' Los Marte '
It will never be difficult to crown you
Buy 'The Magnum in the Minimarket
He tells me that if I have wins', let him mark him
I will touch you alone because
