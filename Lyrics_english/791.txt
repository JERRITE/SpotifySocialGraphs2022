TranslationEnglishsensuality Lyrics ["Sensuality" ft letter. DJ Luian & Mambo Kingz]

[Enter: Bad Bunny & Prince Royce]
Trap Kingz, baby
Yeh-eh, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh (UOH-UH)

[Pre-Caro: Prince Royce & Bad Bunny]
Ay, baby, your sensuality, woh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
It has me on the edge of madness
And this is not a coincidence (Wuh), Woh, OH-OH-OH, OH-OUH
I kiss you and raise the temperature
Ay, baby, your sensuality, woh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
It has me on the edge of madness (madness)
And this is not a coincidence, Woh, OH-OH-OH, OH-OUH
I kiss you and raise the temperature
[Chorus: Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
Baby, where you want to look for you
You wait for me for this way not to call you
Do not bring Paragua ', as well as Mojarce (Skrr')
The temperature is to warm up
Baby, where you want me to look for you
You wait for me for this way not to call you
Do not bring Paragua ', however' it is going to get wet
The temperature is pa 'heat (wuh)

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
There are many behind you, but I always win (I always win)
The baby is hard and without the surgeon (Wuh)
Dress, today looking for you early (Yeh, Yeh!)
I want you to see us hand
With the suit that I bought you
Da-, give it, we arrived after the tre '(tre')
I don't know if you are going to love me tomorrow
Or if after today I will lose you
But you write to me and I look for you at the Lamborghi '
A devil, a kiss from emoji (-ji)
I don't know if you are going to love me tomorrow (-er)
Or if after today I will lose you

[Bridge: Prince Royce & Bad Bunny]
When you are in my room
You feel with me as if the time is paralyzed
It is already that my intention is to be with you
And do it until I get breathless
When you are in my room you feel with me (-Mo)
As if time paralyzed
It is already that my intention is to be with you (Yeh, Yeh)
And do it until I get breathless

Yeah
The night calls, I already activated (EH)

I feel in Victoria because she is an angel (Wuh)
Like Selena and The Weeknd (EH), like Shakira and Piqué
With his Bape Hoodie, I always walk in backstage (Wuh; Yeh)
In France they already know her, we bought everything Chanel (UH-WEH)
Eah, because she is my jeva
Don't touch it because she is a beast (no, no)
