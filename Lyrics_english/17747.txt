Water Resistant Lyrics[Chorus]
I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it means
Touching hands, touching teeth again
I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it means
Touching hands, touching teeth

[Verse 1]
Strange bed, I woke up with a dull ache
My head turns a month into one day
They said it was only till someday
'Cause everything must change
I'm just in the numb phase
[Pre-Chorus]
Won't be seeing me till winter
When I'm much too cold to shiver
Temporary trial and error
Not exactly scared, but

[Chorus]
I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it means
Touching hands, touching teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay, I think I'm alive, I'm just different
Like now my sockets are water resistant
So I think about it when I miss you
I guess it isn't all sad

[Bridge]
'Cause the dirt rolls right off my back
Cut my circuits, I can't feel that
Nothing ever really feels right
Nothing ever feels like you do
(Do you think I'd still fit in my skin suit?)
It used to
(Do you think about me when I miss you?)
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what

I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it means
Touching hands, touching teeth

I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it

I can't wait to wake up from this dream

I can't wait to wake up from this dream
To tell you everything
You'll tell me what it

I can't wait to wake up from this dreamEmbed
