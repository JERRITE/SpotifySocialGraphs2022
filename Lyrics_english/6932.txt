I make love Lyrics [lyrics of "I make you love"]

[Intro]
Eliel!
You know!
(Do you like it...)
(I make love to you ...)

[Chorus: Zion]
You like how I make love to you
You want, I want
So, let's go
You like how I make love to you
You want to
So, let's go
[Verse 1: Lennox]
Bandolera, don't do, I know you love it
I can't take it anymore, tell yourself
You have your face, but you are not holy
You like to go with your friends to hesitate
You like the champagne, janguear at night
Do not make the holy
BLING, BLING AND LUXURY CAR COVERS
Is what you love
You like the champagne, janguear at night
Do not make the holy
You will see Zion and Lennox motivating the Yal
That if you love

[Chorus: Zion]
You like how I make love to you
You want, I want
So, let's go
You like how I make love to you
You want to
So, let's go

[Verse 2: zion]
I take your body
I make you sex first
Then I make love
Once I am sincere
Give me some heat
My love, give it, come, baby
Oh, I want your body
Do what you want
Wherever you want, my love
Fill yourself with passion
Since you are my heart
My love, give it, come, baby

Baby, I want to kiss you
Little by little warm
Don't be like that, don't make the difficult
That my love I want to give you
Baby, I want to kiss you
Little by little warm
Don't be like that, don't make the difficult
That my love I want to give you

[Chorus: Zion]
You like how I make love to you
You want, I want
So, let's go
You like how I make love to you
You want to
So, let's go

Eliel!
You know!
Zion and Lennox!
Motivating the yal!
Alex Gargolas!

Who said they didn't go?
Dad came!
Hey, Pope arrived!
You know!
Take!
(Zion, baby!)
(And Lennox for you!) Embed
