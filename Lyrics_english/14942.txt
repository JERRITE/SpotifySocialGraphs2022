Weak and Powerless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you
[Verse 2]
Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

[Bridge]
Little angel, go away, come again some other day
The devil has my ear today, I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace and some peace of mind
Whatever, just as long as I don't feel so

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

[Outro]
