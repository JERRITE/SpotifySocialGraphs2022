I Think Bad Thoughts LyricsI'll admit it I've done a few things that I shouldn't be proud of
I got no remorse, no regrets never happy endings on these dark sets
And if you wanna get down I can go down as low as you wanna get
I wouldn't try to push me it'll only leave you with regret (don't test me)

I can rip you off, and steal all your cash
Sucker punch you in the face, stand back and laugh
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart attack
All day I think bad thoughts
I can break your heart at the drop of a hat
Stab you in the back, in two minutes flat
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac
I think bad thoughts
Take this to the streets, finish it, flush it down the toilet like you're taking a piss
It should be good to see for a change just a day how the other half lives
And when I take you out I'll stare you down make sure you're getting nervous
You won't understand that's how it is as a knight in Satan's service

I can rip you off, and steal all your cash
Sucker punch you in the face, stand back and laugh
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart attack
All day I think bad thoughts
I can break your heart at the drop of a hat
Stab you in the back in two minutes flat
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac
I think bad thoughts

I think bad thoughts
All day and all night long
I think bad thoughts
Don't care what you think's wrong
If you wanna judge my lifestyle
I'd love to see how you live
Feel free to cast your stones
Don't cry when you're found bleeding

In a heartbeat, I'll turn you white as a sheet begging for mercy on your goddamn knees
It'll be hard to keep from laughing watching you cry will make my week
Just test me, please test me
Push a button, pull a lever, trick or treat
I'm asking "do you have the stuff?" to find out if I can fuck, you, up
You might also likeI can rip you off, and steal all your cash
Sucker punch you in the face stand back and laugh
Leave you stranded as fast as a heart attack
I think bad thoughts
All day and all night long
I think bad thoughts
Don't care what you think's wrong

I can tell them lies 'til you're left in disgrace
Kick you when you're down, and spit in your face
Lead you on 'til you're lost without a trace
I think bad thoughts
All day and all night long
I think bad thoughts
Don't care what you think's wrong

I can break your heart at the drop of a hat
Stab you in the back in two minutes flat
Screw your girl in the back of my Cadillac
