Let Me Go Down LyricsDon't you feel the same way - think about our love
I see your face, your smile, I can't get enough - babe
Still dream about the good times that we shared together
Why won't you turn back, can't you sense my sadness -
It's now or never
Life felt so much easier on sunny days
But then it changed to a silly game
Friendship without love, girl - that doesn't mean a thing...

Come on let me go down
I know how it feels to lose someone real
I can't get off the ground
Right now it's time that my pain is revealed
Come on let me go down
I know how it feels to lose someone real
I don't wanna get off the ground
Right now it's time that my pain is revealed
I look around and all I see is emptiness
There is no light today, my life is a mess now
I met some girls, but no one can compete with you
Why don't you call me, I wanna leave this haunted place
Help me to get away
I feel that my whole world is falling apart
Please bring the glue that can fix my heart
Put it together and free my soul before I lose control...

Come on let me go down
I know how it feels to lose someone real
I can't get off the ground
Right now it's time that my pain is revealed
Come on let me go down
I know how it feels to lose someone real
I don't wanna get off the ground
Right now it's time that my pain is revealedYou might also likeEmbed
