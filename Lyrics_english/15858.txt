By pure curiosity Lyricsletra of "for pure curiosity"
[Verse 1]
Because of that mouth that I'm wanting to bite
I don't sleep anymore, I don't sleep
Because of your eyes and your curves, woman
I'm sick of love, I don't know what to do

[Pre-car]
That black dress you wear
It has me analyzing you from north to south
I go on the road, your hips
All night
[Chorus]
For pure curiosity, when the light went out
I went to kiss you and you liked it
For pure curiosity, so it happened to us
And here you have me looking for a place for two

[Post-car]
With this downpour
That the rain falls, I am that I burn
With this downpour
Let the rain fall, my sky

[Verse 2]
I was bored
And now with you everything is fun
I no longer ask what day is today
I no longer look at the clock

I was bored
And now with you everything is fun
I no longer ask what day is today
I don't even look at the clock

[Pre-car]
That black dress you wear
It has me analyzing you from north to south
I go on the road, your hips
All night
You might also like the way you dance
With that movement and with that attitude
That it falls to me, it despairs me

[Chorus]
For pure curiosity, when the light went out
I went to kiss you and you liked it
For pure curiosity, so it happened to us
And here you have me looking for a place for two

[Post-car]
With this downpour
That the rain falls, I am that I burn
With this downpour
Let the rain fall, my sky

[Chorus]
For pure curiosity, when the light went out
I went to kiss you and you liked it
For pure curiosity, so it happened to us
And here you have me looking for a place for two

[Post-car]
With this downpour (I was bored)
With this downpour (and now with you everything is fun)
With this downpour
Let the rain fall, my sky
