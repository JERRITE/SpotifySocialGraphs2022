Up and Away Lyrics[Verse 1: David Eff]
Alright!
Kick back, relax, and grab yourself a beverage
Or hop if you want to just bounce to my leverage
The evidence, as they say is in the pudding
So show me the money, like my name is Cuba Gooding
It ain't fools gold, its gold, fool
Can't stop won't stop keeping it old school, so cool
Big Spoon is my nom de plume
I keep it popping like a needle in a new balloon
And if you don't know by now then you need more schoolin'
Let loose kid, get stupid
Got more flavor than I know what to do with
So get your hands up if you're part of the movement
And bump to the bump to the baseline
I made it rock before your phone had Facetime
Yessiree, you know my steeze
I stay fresh to death like I'm drowning in Febreze
[Chorus]
Up up and away we go
Up up and it's making me glow
Up up and away we go
Up up, and I'm liking it
Up up and away!

[Verse 2: June]
Up and away
I'm in pilot mode
One step ahead on this xylophone
That means I boss farther
Speak doh on Bart's father
Home overhead and I'm all story
All eyes on your boy, and I'm post side
Wait until you're outside, it's a more live-r
Let me open up like this a boy-knocker
Show you how I lay it down boy, so proper
No scholar but much class
I'm jump felt under your nose like a mustache, my pet splash
Equivalent of a benzo, M-Class
So fly my wardrobe, call me jet lag
Cash my dough cause my hook says fresh crack
So dope, I'm a certified meth lab
Pet nab has been that it got been fresh
All eyes on my pen game, Pintrest
That journal, holla fame, dollar game
Something big like wallets, you pocket change
All about presidents no politician
But every big face need your running mate
You might also like[Chorus: David Eff & June]
Up up and away we go
Up up and it's making me glow
Up up and away we go
Up up, and I'm liking it
Up up and away!

[Verse 3: David Eff]
Hello nurse, let me burst on this verse
I rock steady but I never rehearse
And every verse I work is right on the money
Yo, I got more raps than a mummy, honey
This be the boogie to jump start your ventricles
Strapped on the track like tentacles
I put the squeeze on these other MC's
Cutting imitators off at the knees, oh please
The way I'm ripping it up
I never let up so hold on to your butts
And Imma wake you up, show you how it's done
I'll kick your swagger in the athletic cup, son
I'm blessed to be spittin' these rhymes
Instead of sitting in a cubicle and losing my mind
So this is my time to shine
And I'm gonna do it so bright
I'll make Bustas go blind
[Chorus: David Eff & June]
Up up and away we go
Up up and it's making me glow
Up up and away we go
Up up, and I'm liking it
Up up and away!
