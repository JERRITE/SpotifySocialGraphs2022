FIST FIGHT Lyrics[Intro]

[Chorus]
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight

[Verse 1]
Spit venom, BLACKWIDOW with a barcode
Blacked out, like my arm, and all my clothes
Black Audi, black rims, black windows
Black heart, black lungs, and a black soul
Old plugs, new drugs, new gun smoke
If you pull up to my crib have a blunt rolled
Bring a bitch, she won’t even wanna leave bro
XIII, that’s the number of the beast hoe
[Chorus]
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight

[Verse 2]
I’m from a city where bags don’t come free
I’m quick on my feet, never down on my knees
Thе ones that fuck with me, the onеs that I need
Some show hate, some show love, so talkin' is cheap
I ride with my brothers REDSTAR RSG
I trust 'em, they trust me, we don’t need to speak
We don’t play, so watch how you talkin' to me
If we make a call then we pullin' up deep

[Chorus]
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
You ain’t fuckin with the gang, bitch, think twice
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fight
If you run up, knuckle up, it’s a fist fightYou might also likeEmbed
