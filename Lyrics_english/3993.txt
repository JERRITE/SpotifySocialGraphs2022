Crazy for you Lyrics [Lyrics of "Crazy for you"]

[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

[Pre-car]
It was worth waiting, to make so many steps
Because I understood that love is really
It is built slowly and waiting
It was what brought you to my arms, and I don't plan to release
[Chorus]
And pay attention to the heart
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason
It will tell you that you are crazy
Pay attention to the heart
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason (no)
Stay with me and don't give him explanation (OH-OH)
(Stay with me and do not give him explanation)

[Verse 1]
(Yeah, ah; wuh!)
Ah, you ere 'one in a million (wah)
You have haunted me, I lost reason (wah)
We always had connection
That you were you shouted my heart
For you changed my luck
Much 'night' in candle dreaming of having you
Life sent me to protect you
Open me strong and don't let go

[Chorus]
And pay attention to the heart (OH-OH)
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason
It will tell you that you are crazy
Pay attention to the heart (-on)
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason (no)
Stay with me and do not give him explanation (OH-OH, UOH)

With you I earned the lottery
I thought I would not achieve it
You are love, but to love I feared him
Because I didn't know you
No matter how difficult
I know it was worth it
My life was alone (alone-ah)
With you is already full, full
No matter how difficult
I know it was worth it
My life was alone
With you is already full, full

[Pre-car]
And wait
It was what brought you to my arms, and I don't plan to release

[Chorus]
And pay attention to the heart (OH-OH)
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason
It will tell you that you are crazy
Pay attention to the heart (-on)
The heart is not wrong
Don't listen to reason (no)
Stay with me and don't give him explanation
