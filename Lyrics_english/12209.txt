All Is Forgiven Lyrics[Intro]
All is forgiven
All is forgiven
All is forgiven
All is forgiven

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about things before they happen
Floating around in my head for a while
All of a sudden it's grown too big to handle
Changed its clothes and grown a mind of its own
Too loud to listen, too proud to put paper to the pen
Clean up this place from the vacuum of my head
Too many times zones 2000 planes
Take on the distance it only brings me back again
These books are overdue and there's a tenderness inside
The depth of the liner watch the characters comes alive
Dip into the system feel the volume fill the space
Bending horizons fall into place
[Chorus]
All is forgiven
All is forgiven
All is forgiven
Time will clean us
Absolute, Absolution
All is forgiven
Time is a genius
Absolute, Absolution
All is forgiven
All is forgiven

[Verse 2]
Why don't we shift these shapes make the landscape disappear
Tectonic plates serving powers to your fears
Sometimes I hear that voice when words were never spoken
Proceed with caution before glass is ever broken
Quantise the grove while it's dancing in your head
Control emotions find me drifting instead
Too way feel better about it, go and knit some sweaters about it
Two stone statues trying hard not to laugh
Maybe there's something in the movement, or the stillness of the air
Put that good stuff on ice and keep that elephant over there
Let's shift through modern times, I hold the future past
None existing obstacles squarely in our path
You might also like[Chorus]
All is forgiven
Time will clean us
Absolute, absolution
All is forgiven
Time is a genius
Absolute, absolution
All is forgiven
Time will clean us
Absolute, absolution
All is forgiven
Absolute, absolutionEmbed
