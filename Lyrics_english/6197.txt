Synesthesia Lyrics[Verse 1]
Save your smile, everything fades through time
Lost for words, endlessly waiting for you
Stay with me, yes I know, this cannot be
As morning comes, I'll say goodbye to you when I'm done
Through the sun...

[Chorus]
Because I'm waiting for you, waiting for this
Dream to come true, just to be with you
And if I die, remember these lines
I'm always here, guarding your life
Guarding your life...
[Verse 2]
I am yours, and I'm completely trapped in your soul
Dazed and confused, swept away with your whole world
You're my star, invincible, haunting and far
Grace under fire, something is deep in my heart, in my heart

[Chorus]
Because I'm waiting for you, waiting for this
Dream to come true, just to be with you
And if I die, remember these lines
I'm always here, guarding your...

[Bridge]
Slowly falling into you
I'm obsessed with the fact that I'm with you
I can't breathe without you, ooh-oohh

[Chorus]
Because I'm waiting for you, waiting for this
Dream to come true, just to be with you
And if I die, remember these lines
I'm always here, guarding your life...
Ohh, oh-oh, oh-ohYou might also likeEmbed
