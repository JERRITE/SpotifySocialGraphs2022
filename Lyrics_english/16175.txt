The Worst of You Lyrics[Verse 1: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
Are you capable of driving home tonight
Or am I the one that has to get us home?
Handed you another chance to disappoint me and again you did me wrong
Am I really waking up alone again
In your bed and you've already gone?
Co-existing at its finest, yeah
We're barely even trying anymore

[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus, Noah Cyrus]
And it feels like all I ever do is
Pay for your excuses
To buy a little time
I don't know why I even entertain it
You're never gonna change, hеll, you're never gonna try
So why am I still tryna provе, that I can love the worst of you?
[Verse 2: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
Laying here just waiting on the morning light
To finally find its way under our door
Living fast and dying slowly, just two cold and lonely bodies nothing more
Ooh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus, Noah Cyrus]
And it feels like all I ever do is
Pay for your excuses
To buy a little time
I don't know why I even entertain it
You're never gonna change, Hell, you're never gonna try
So why am I still tryna prove, that I can love the worst of you?

[Outro: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
I do, I do
I'll always love the worst of you
I do, I do
I'll always love the worst of you
Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah (Woah, oh-oh)
I do, I do (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
I'll always love the worst of you
Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah (Woah, oh-oh)
I do, I do (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
I'll always love the worst of youYou might also like1Embed
