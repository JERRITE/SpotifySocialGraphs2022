For making me the good lyrics [letter of "for making me the good"]

[Verse 1:]
I stayed with his face
I stayed with his joy
I smoked his words
And she stole mine
I got lost in silence
Remembering our day
And the next morning
I discovered that I wanted her
[Pre-car:]
And believe it or not, I wanted to be faithful
I already had a life, with another woman
And believe it or not, I remembered there
Water you don't drink, let it run

[Chorus:]
For making me the good
I did not go to the appointment and the champagne
I was already cold, I left you dressed
Knowing that you were already mine
For making me the good
I was with you, like a coward
Without the balls, to kiss you
I lost my chance to fall in love

[Post-Coro:]
For making me the good
For making me the good
That's why I lost you
For making me the good
For making me the good
You go away from me

[Verse 2:]
I already walked through the hills
I looked for her for a thousand roads
The dogs already threw me
I already woke up the neighbors
I dreamed of finding her
And finally do mine
To write the end
That this story deserved
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro:]
And believe it or not finally I found it
I looked at her again and loved her again
And believe it or not, seeing me told me
Water you don't drink, let it run

[Chorus:]
For making me the good
I did not go to the appointment and the champagne
I was already cold, I left you dressed
Knowing that you were already mine
For making me the good
I was with you, like a coward
Without the balls, to kiss you
I lost my chance to fall in love

[Post-Coro:]
For making me the good
For making me the good
That's why I lost you
For making me the good
For making me the good
You go away from me

[Chorus:]
For making me the good
I did not go to the appointment and the champagne
I was already cold, I left you dressed
Knowing that you were already mine
For making me the good
I was with you, like a coward
Without the balls, to kiss you
I lost my chance to fall in love
[Post-Coro:]
For making me the good
For making me the good
That's why I lost you
For making me the good
For making me the good
You continue far from me2embed
