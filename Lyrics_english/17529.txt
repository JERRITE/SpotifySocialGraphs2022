Iâ€™m Alive - Radio Edit LyricsI'm alive

I've been living on a prayer
In a house of empty rooms
Thou you were no easy lover
I've never lost my faith in you

It's a never-ending story
It's a caravan of love
You're the voice of inspiration
I'm never gonna give you up
I never give you up
I'm alive
(I am alive)
I'm alive
(I am alive now baby)
Now I've found the greatest love
I will survive
(I will survive)

Nothing's gonna stop us
Now I'm sure
I will walk the walk of life forever young
(I am alive)

You're the answer to the riddle
C'est la vie
Life is life
And we're dancing on the cealing
Into the beat of neutron dance
The beat of neutron dance

I'm alive
(I am alive)
I'm alive
(I am alive now baby)
Now I've found the greatest love
I will survive
(I will survive)

Now I'm sure
I will walk the walk of life forever young
(I am alive)

You were born to be my baby
It's just the way you make me feel
You're my heart, you're my soul
So take on me

I'm alive
(I am alive)
I'm alive
(I am alive now baby)
Now I've found the greatest love
I will survive
(I will survive)

Nothing's gonna stop us
Now I'm sure
I will walk the walk of life forever young
(I am alive)
