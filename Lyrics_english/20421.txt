Beat the Sunrise Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby there's a hole in my heart tonight
Maybe you can be my lifeline
All aboard this lonely, lonely ride
Riding with one headlight
We can stop, but we can't rewind
We only got tomorrow
Nothing's gonna stop us
Baby there's a hole in my heart tonight
Maybe we can beat the sunrise
We can beat the sunrise
We can beat the sunrise
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunrise

[Chorus]
Baby there's a hole in my heart tonight
Maybe you can be my lifeline
All aboard this lonely, lonely ride
Riding with one headlight
We can stop, but we can't rewind
We only got tomorrow
Nothing's gonna stop us
Baby there's a hole in my heart tonight
Maybe we can beat the sunrise

We can beat the sunrise
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunrise
Ooh ooh ooh
We can beat the sunriseYou might also likeEmbed
