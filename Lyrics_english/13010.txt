Komorebi Lyrics[Verse 1: Craft Spells]
Take the time to know
How alone you are in this world
Just to find
Death is on your mind
As you stand still, you realize where you are
In her world
Aged and bright
My moon after the tide

[Verse 2: Craft Spells]
How was I to show
For the time i spend alone in my head
The world nobody knows
As i lay still, your wind carried the clouds
To feel
Slow and kind
My moon after the tideYou might also like4Embed
