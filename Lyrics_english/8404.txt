Your Prince Lyrics [letter from "your prince" ft. Zion & Lennox]

[Pre-car: Zion, Daddy]
If you knew what happens to me every time I see you
(You know, baby, c'mon, ma ')
I would like to confess what I feel and I don't dare
(Do you understand what I tell you now, ma '?)
A thousand emotions dominate me every time I see you
I see you close and at the same time I feel so far
(Pug, Zion! C'mon!)
[Chorus 1: Zion, Daddy]
If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince
Be beyond a friend

If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince (we were Lejo, pa ')
I'm dying to be with you (Daddy!)

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
How can I do it
To tell him that this man dies
For having him, Gyal
He wants and at the same time cannot contain himself
And that hurts me
How it hurts, Gyal

[Chorus 2: Daddy Yankee]
There is nothing wrong-it, in giving it heat-wiper
You can barely see, everything I feel for you
You have me crazy woman, I don't say that I don't want
The cure of my love you are and you don't know
Simple, Easy
I will not let anyone in my place stew
You, my killer, that my life steals
I don't say it jokingly, tell me, what happened, ma '?

If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince
Be beyond a friend

If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince
I'm dying to be with you

[Verse 2: Lennox]
I'm looking for, mommy, how to tell you what I feel for you
Not having you continues to cause me suffering
But if you saw me with my eyes that I see you
You were my Julieta and I forever your Romeo
I want to have you here, my baby, on a serene night
Loving us under the full moon
I live, and for you diverse me
Let's see if I get beyond a friend
I want to have you here, my baby, on a serene night
Loving us under the full moon
I live, and for you diverse me
Let's see if I get beyond a friend

[Chorus 2: Daddy Yankee]
There is nothing wrong-it, in giving it heat-wiper
You can barely see, everything I feel for you
You have me crazy woman, I don't say that I don't want
The cure of my love you are and you don't know
(What what what!?)
[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
Nor do I want to damage friendship
But the reality is that I live for you nothing more, you know?
I dare not tell him the truth, but I can't stand anymore
To tell him that it is my half half, you know?

[Pre-car: Zion, Daddy]
If you knew what happens to me every time I see you
I would like to confess what I feel and I don't dare
A thousand emotions dominate me every time I see you (You know how we do?)
I see you close and at the same time I feel so far
(Pegota Zion, c'mon!)

[Chorus 1: Zion]
If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince
Be beyond a friend

If you felt the same as me
You were here with me
You were my girlfriend and I your prince
I'm dying to be with you

[Outro: Zion, Daddy]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Zion, Baby
And Lennox
Daddy!
You know how we do, man!
