Freddieâ€™s Dead Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Freddie, Freddie's dead, uh
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan, said he'd send him home
But his hope was a rope and he should've known

[Verse 1]
It's hard to understand
There was love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery was his woman and things
[Chorus]
Freddie's dead
That's what I said, hey

[Verse 2]
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another jughead plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A terrible blow, but that's how it goes
Freddie's on the corner now

[Chorus]
And if you wanna be a junkie, well
Just remember, Freddie's dead

[Verse 3]
We're all built up with progress
But sometimes, I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But, reality, what does it mean?

[Chorus]
Ain't a damn thing said
'Cause Freddie's dead
You might also like[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, aha

[Verse 4]
All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl, oh, I need a woman, child
Why can't we brothers
Protect one another?
No one's serious
And it makes me furious

[Chorus]
Freddie's dead, don't be misled
Just think of Fred
Don't be misled-led-led-led-led
Just think of Fred

[Verse 6]
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another jughead plan
Pushin' dope for the man
Freddie's on the corner now
And if you wanna be a junkie, well
Freddie's dead
Freddie, Freddie, Freddie, Freddie
Freddie's dead
Huh, huh, huh
Freddie's dead
Yeah, yeah
Freddie's dead
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Freddie's dead
Freddie, Freddie
Freddie's dead
UhEmbed
