Money Same Color Lyrics[Intro: DJ Lucas & papo2oo4]

I'm a whole different breed of person than you ever met
Money same color Joe Namath jersey when he played for the Jets
Hunnids same color T-Mac jersey when he played for the Magic
Ain't give a fuck bout no money started getting it then it turned to a habit, damn

[Verse 1: papo2oo4]

Can't talk if he ain't livin', if he dead he dead
If you won't get in the game better pray for [?]
In with the act and I'm really a movie
Somewhere relaxin', might be with a judy
In the last month smoked me a cutie
Dirty Designer I'm bout it, bout it
Got some new drip, I forgot about it
Fugazi shit I cannot allow it, nah
It's like you livin' on a shelf and you very stale
Already read you, you's a fairy tale
Bro say he flippinâ€™ dogs, no tiny white
These niggas fake like AEW Dynamite
Goin' hard Titlefight
Showing love if she ain't gon' [?]
Papo a real nigga, keepin' a stack
[?] my denim, I'm tryna relax
Might go to Vermont and invest in a pack
Tryna figure out how we bringin' em back
[Verse 2: DJ Lucas]

Dirty Designer I mismatch
I ain't tryna get a six pack
And my freedom I risked that
Once or twice to get a big bag
All these drugs are gettin' cut
Just like the line to go to Six Flags
Some things are fucked up
And I'm not sure how we gon' fix that
Man, them drugs they don't help me escape
Honestly, they just put me in a box
In a world where I'm already lost
Walk down the wrong street, you might get shot
Gotta look on the bright side, I ain't gettin help, somebody got it
And you only live once baby, I ain't got no time for being psychotic
And my Prius is silent, it's needed for worship
Man, I just gotta go with my heart
Even though my ancestors might not encourage it
I rock Dirty Designer
Burberry what my shirt says
And my homie pop Perc 10s
Kinda sad he [?]
Get a copy from the store, then
Smoke a bleepy with the doorman
The way I'm cleaner than the [?]
Hella bitches like a Mormon
Took my homies out in [?]
Started hitting all the mill towns
Only the real ones are still down
I can still feed a sealed mouth

I'm a whole different breed of person than you ever met
Money same color Joe Namath jersey when he played for the Jets
Hunnids same color T-Mac jersey when he played for the Magic
Ain't give a fuck bout no money started getting it then it turned to a habit, damn
Smokin' on earthbound, my people will talk niggas out of the [?]
Walkin' on everything I'm getting on, unless I'm taking a stroll
Watch who you fuckin' with, niggas is trolls
Give me the rock, I'll take it to the hoe
Dirty Designer my pants four hunnid
I've been that nigga since Chris Brown Run ItEmbed
