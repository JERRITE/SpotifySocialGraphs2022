A Couple Of Forevers LyricsI see it clear, my heart is here
We got each other, let's take it from there
And if I could I'd love you a forever at time, oh, oh, oh
What we've been through no one else knows
'Cause all that matters is how far this goes
And it will go until it starts again, oh, oh

Me and you are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking for much
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never

I'm talking about forever
Just a couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never

It can get hard, damn it gets rough
It can get crazy but not for us
Guess we gotta struggle just to stay apart

Me and you are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking for much

Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers oh, ooh
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never

Oh, I'm talking about forever
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers, ooh ooh
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never, never never

Can you see the signs from above
It's so blinding
There's no denying

You and me are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking you for much
A couple of forevers
Ever, ever
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Together 'til never
Ever
Forever and ever, and ever
Ever
Forever and ever, and ever
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Together 'til never10Embed
