TranslationsEspañolThis Is Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
At the gate
I'm coming inside, I know that it's late
But I'm here, 'cause your body my motivation
Let's skip the talk
What if we found a way to get lost without fear?
Leave it all behind, we're escaping

[Pre-Chorus]
If you told me that my faith was on your fingertips
Then I wouldn't believe it
I wouldn't believe it, yeah
Every kiss with you, it's like your prayer falls from my lips
Now I'm a believer
Yeah, I'm a believer (Oh)
[Chorus]
This is Heaven
And I don't know how this could get much bettеr (Yeah)
Than you and me, herе right now
This is Heaven
And every time I touch you, it gets better
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now
This is Heaven (This is Heaven, yeah, this is Heaven)
This is Heaven (This is Heaven, oh, this is Heaven)
This is...

[Verse 2]
Sunrise
Another long night lost in your eyes
So don't blink
You're the center of my attention, yeah
I know, nothing is perfect, but this is close
So don't go, keep it comin' in my direction

[Pre-Chorus]
If you told me that my fate was on your fingertips
Then, I wouldn't believe it (I wouldn't believe it)
I wouldn't believe it (I wouldn't believe it)
Every kiss with you, it's like a prayer falls from my lips
Now I'm a believer (I'm a believer)
Yeah, I'm a believer (Oh)
