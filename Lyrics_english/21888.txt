Light in Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something is happenin'
Everything's different
But everything is fine, yeah
This is the good stuff
And yesterday's only what you leave behind
It's only in your mind

[Chorus]
You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes
[Verse 2]
No use pretending
You never existed
Until you saw the light, yeah
Well, you're just beginning
You haven't missed it, it's all ahead of you
And you know what to do

[Chorus]
You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes

[Bridge]
Here comes the world
And she is beautifully mysterious
She's got it all and you say
"Give it to me"

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's happy
That's not the world I know inside
Where everybody hides
You might also like[Chorus]
You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All that light in your eyes
All that light in your eyes
You gotta talk to the one who loves you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes

[Outro]
Yeah, thank you, thank you
Yeah, everything great and small
Yeah, thank you, thank you
For the light in your eyes
Yeah, thank you, thank you
Yeah, everything great and small
Yeah, thank you, thank you
For the light in your eyes
For the light in your eyesEmbed
