Corona'o, Corona'o, as drug trafficker
Pa 'la' woman 'sweet, pa' los tiguere 'spicy
And I don't ask me ', I don't have to explain you
Who fantasizes to me instantly
Andamo 'Russian roulette in ghostfantasma'
Call the Conne, tell him that the pod has arrived
To the 'detect' lea leathe 'the' alarm '
If I'm going for the album, the 'weapon' has to pass
The 'suitcase' and the 'bulge' Special Edition
To the 'demá' the treatment as if it were a saying
You 'tenant', I owned building
We 'Andamo' in fourth ', by leather' I don't suffocate me
You ere 'a mamanograph and if nothing achieves'
E 'because the damn demagogy consumes you
Louis Vuitton portfolio and Goyal backpack
Smell, he's listening to paranoia
