Sometimes I think Lyrica times I think
What do I make love to you
What does not sleep alone
And I'm not perfect
As a human being I have feeling
That's why
For me everyone jumps
Strong, strong, strong, strong
For you know that I am the Q command
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Hey aggressive you came out
Strong, strong, strong, strong
No fight rake
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Why are you who makes me bad
About the thoughts that betray
And they make you act in such a way
Q at home I will not arrive
(I don't want to have discussions)
Nor fights I will cause to turn on the flame and turn off
I crazy about condiments
Try my slow reggaeton
I cry at all times, happy
Listen again when my name is shouts
Get the woman who with my skin is excited
I've been lost in work and preparation for a long time
Looking for the fan, hold the relationship
On the occasion of forming a family man
And live forever this one that my daughter is great
I crazy about condiments
Try my slow reggaeton
I cry at all times, happy
Listen again when my name is shouts
Get the woman who with my skin is excited

Sometimes I think
What do I make love to you
What does not sleep alone
And I'm not perfect
As a human being I have feeling
That's why
For me everyone jumps
Strong, strong, strong, strong
For you know that I am the Q command
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Hey aggressive you came out
Strong, strong, strong, strong
No fight rake
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Why are you who makes me bad
You might also likehay say what they say
You are the only one in my life
Although my job prevents it
I will do the impossible for you
There are what they say
You are the only one in my life
Although my job prevents it
I will do the impossible for you

Sometimes I think
What do I make love to you
But I love you I lose feeling
What do I say if it is and if I don't miss you
What you kieres is not wasting time
And what happens
We didn't go to the outcome
That do not kill you out of base
Everything you do if another you satisfy it
I don't want you to come with my maves
You at one hundred percent but I have a story
Just an attempt at this follow -up
I'm not lying
Today I want to feel your breath and caress you

Tonight is to give you
There is prepare
I'm going to devour part by
Forgive at night I have arrived late
I have been wrapped and I haven't come to love you
Kiero give him Pichon
Vamo to action
What night mami the snake was released
Warm
And well tasty
To give you Sason and put the pellejon
If I start fraketear to see I give me
Eske had to lose you
Not to be able to give you
I'm going to give you today
Strong, strong, strong, strong
For you know that I am the Q command
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Hey aggressive you came out
Strong, strong, strong, strong
No fight rake
Strong, strong, strong, strong
Why are you who makes me bad

Sometimes I think
What do I make love to you
What does not sleep alone
And I'm not perfect
As a human being I have feeling
That's why
For me everyone jumps
