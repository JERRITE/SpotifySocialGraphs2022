Why Wait Lyrics[Verse 1]
One is luscious, one is speaking Spanish
And, uh, one is giving me a vantage
Point I want it
Put it all in my face and more
Let’s get immoral
Say no more we can do it one time
Another one fine, another one, I’m alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you got me like, oh whoa
Bend it over, baby, dip it low
Ain’t nobody in here gotta know
Whatcha waiting for, oh whoa
Bend it over, baby, dip it low
[Hook]
Why wait, why wait
Make it, make it vibrate
Why wait, why wait
Make it, make it vibrate
Why wait, why wait
Make it, make it vibrate
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme that cake
Say no more we can do it one time
Another one fine, another one, I’m alive
Why wait, why wait
Why wait, why wait

[Verse 2]
I wanna touch it
I don’t wanna say please
And, uh, fuck it
I’mma get on my knees ‘cause I love it
Baby girl, you’re so sweet and more
This can’t be normal
Say no more we can do it one time
Another one fine, another one, I’m alive

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Spin around, drop it down to the ground
Love me on the floor
Don’t leave me wanting more
Spin around, drop it down, do it now
Fuck me on the floor
I’ll never ask for more

Another one fine, another one, I’m alive
Why wait, why wait
Why wait, why wait

[Bridge]
What are you
What are you waiting for?
What are you
What are you waiting for?
Oh whoa

[Hook]
