Don't flutter Lyrics [Intro]
I'm anxious every day because of you
Even today, the damn person not to go to you

[Verse 1]
Why are you always so many brothers?
Why don't you say anything else
Why is the phone turn off when I meet my sister
It's funny, so why are you doing it?

[Verse 2]
Even if I deceive it once, I don't deceive twice
I can't get anywhere else
This man, rather than a little bit of a man
If you get tired again, kick and kick and come back
Why again? Of course no!
All of the men except me
You're right here
Tomb
I will wake up. I'm crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't play with me, it's not a joke
Don't be annoyed, it's more annoying

[Chorus]
I'm anxious every day because of you
Even today, the damn person does not have you
Don't be honest, even if you're too much
Even today, I guess you won't be taken away from the other guy

[Verse 3]
It's ridiculous to go to a friend's house with dark makeup
Why is the skirt so short today
I know better than anyone who loves me
I really want to believe you are misunderstanding

[Verse 4]
Finally after a long wait
Your call came early
Did you have fun or want to play
I have no choice but to endure you
Snow smile and tail
Breaking up alone
If you forget, come back to me and hit the back
It's been rumored to have already come to the neighborhood. Where was you last night?
I'd rather lie

Don't play with me, it's not a joke
Don't be annoyed, it's more annoying

[Chorus]
I'm anxious every day because of you
Even today, the damn person does not have you
Don't be honest, even if you're too much
Even today, I guess you won't be taken away from the other guy

[OUTRO]
Don't be funny, don't think about me
If you leave, nothing left
Don't cry, don't think about it
It's the last time to deceive it is Embed
