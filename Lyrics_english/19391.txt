Hey Ben Lyrics[Verse 1]:
I got some things that I've been meaning to get off my chest
Been holding on to this so long I've never been so stressed
And this might just weird you out but I flagged you down to say
I know we haven't met, but we've got tons of friends in common
And lying isn't me, so I'll just be completely honest

[Chorus]:
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might have slept with your girlfriend
I was under the impression she was my girlfriend
Don't worry it won't happen again
But, hey Ben, I can't make any promises
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might havе slept with your girlfriend
I guess shе went and fucked around with both our heads
I think I might have ruined your day
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you found out from me
[Verse 2]:
I tried to let it go but I'm just lying to myself
Thought we were getting back on track, but we went off the rails
And you know it breaks my heart, to say this part but

[Chorus]:
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might have slept with your girlfriend
I was under the impression she was my girlfriend
Don't worry it won't happen again
But, hey Ben, I can't make any promises
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might have slept with your girlfriend
I guess she went and fucked around with both our heads
I think I might have ruined your day
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you found out this way
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you had to find out from me
I'm sorry that you had to find out from me

[Verse 3]:
And I know we've never met, but we have so much in common
If you don't believe me check to see my skeleton in her closet
And I know you'll find the dirt behind, the dates and times the alibis
The text she sent November 9th, I dare you ask to read it

[Chorus]:
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might have slept with your girlfriend
I was under the impression she was my girlfriend
Don't worry it won't happen again
But, hey Ben, I can't make any promises
Hey Ben, I'm sorry but I might have slept with your girlfriend
I guess she went and fucked around with both our heads
I think I might have ruined your day
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you found out this way
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you had to find out from me
I'm sorry that you had to find out from me
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you found out this way
Hey Ben, I'm sorry that you had to find out from meYou might also like1Embed
