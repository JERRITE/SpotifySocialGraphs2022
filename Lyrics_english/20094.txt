PLEASEDONTGOAWAY Lyrics[Intro]
Ahem

[Verse 1]
So cold, a place so desolate, abandoned
What have I done for you to cast me away?
What can I do to make you stay?
My vision’s turning black and grey

[Chorus]
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Don't go away
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Don't go away
[Verse 2]
Once I thought you werе the one to heal thе hurt, erase the scars
Waiting for when you return to show me who you truly are
Two empty shells, what we've become, my heart is turning weak and numb
One day, you're here, the next, you're gone, no longer here to keep me calm

[Chorus]
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Don't go away
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
Don't go awayYou might also like1Embed
