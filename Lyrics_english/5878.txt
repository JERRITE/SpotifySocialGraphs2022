Twenty Years Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are twenty years to go
And twenty ways to know
Who will wear
Who will wear the hat
There are twenty years to go
The best of all I hope
Enjoy the ride
The medicine show

[Chorus]
And them's the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
[Verse 2]
There are twenty years to go
The faithful and the low
The best of starts, the broken heart
The stone
There are twenty years to go
The punch-drunk and the blow
The worst of starts, the mercy part
The phone

[Chorus]
And them's the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
And them's the breaks for we designer fakes
But it's you I take, cause you're the truth, not I

[Verse 3]
There are twenty years to go
A golden age I know
But all will pass, we'll end too fast
You know
There are twenty years to go
And many friends I hope
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope

[Bridge]
And that's the end, and that's the start of it
That's the whole, and that's the part of it
That's the high, and that's the heart of it
That's the long, and that's the short of it
That's the best, and that's the test in it
That's the doubt, the doubt, the trust in it
That's the sight, and that's the sound of it
That's the gift, and that's the trick in it
You might also like[Outro]
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not IEmbed
