I don't need lyrics ["I don't need" letter]

[Saying]
Another summer night and I'm cold
You fired with the vacuum bullet
Completely unknown
I thought about what I didn't say ’
And I feel a hair in my tongue, my love
Hair on the tongue, my love, oh

[Verse]
I want to get to your infinity
To know if you are the Flor del Prince
Dimo ’a return and you got lost
For everything we did not say
I feel a hair in my tongue, my love
Hair on the tongue, my love, oh
[Chorus]
I don't need a song to miss you
Everything has your voice, everything is two
When I'm alone, you don't feel different
Everything has your voice, everything is two

[Bridge]
Health, Don’t Think About It
Money? I'm already as I want
Let's take advantage that love reaches
That still gives belly pain
It is not so difficult ma ', don't tell me no
Vamo ’to try the same if we are you and I

[Chorus]
I don't need a song to miss you
Everything has your voice, everything is two
When I'm alone, you don't feel different
Everything has your voice, everything is two

[Saying]
Another summer night and I'm cold
You fired with the vacuum bullet
Completely unknown
I thought about what I didn't say ’
And I have a hair in my tongue, my love
Hair on the tongue, my love, Ohyou Might Also Likeembed
