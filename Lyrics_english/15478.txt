I still think about you, we are fired
That goodbye
That made us fall ...

We succeed the game
We both fail
We let ourselves be lost

Nothing else we would have
That the latter look
In recent years
If we could count
Our history until the end
The damage and space would remain
Because I didn't give in
When it came to trust you
I don't know how to value
From before starting
Because I didn't ask
Let the time go when I saw you
And although now there is someone else
Today I find it difficult to accept
That I still think about you

We celebrate the day
I met you
Now forget it

Nothing else we would have
That the latter look
In recent years
If we could tell our story until the end
The damage and space will remain

Because I didn't give in
When it came to trust you
I don't know how to value
From before starting
Because I didn't ask
Let the time go when I saw you
And although now there is someone else
Today I find it difficult to accept
That I still think about you
You might also like when you began to feel your heat
Love was my hands

Because I didn't give in when I was about trusting you
I don't know how to value
From before starting

Because I didn't ask
Let the time go when I saw you
And although now there is someone else
Today I find it difficult to accept
That I still think about you

That I still think about you ...
I still think about you ... embed
