Now he says (real to death remix) Lyrics [letter of "now says (real to remix death)" ft. Archangel, Anuel AA, Cardi B&FSET]

[Intro: Anuel AA, Archangel, J Balvin, Anuel Aa & Ozuna]
Real until death, did you hear, baby? (Ah, ah-ah; Auh!)
You don't want to know about me (uh, na-na)
Tell me what I did wrong (tell me what happened)
They put you against me (uh, na-na)
But it is worse to apologize than forgive
A flower died (flower), and changed color (Yeah-Yeh)
You was' my devil and I gave you hot
Smoking to forget, to kill the pain
And I want to die, but nobody has died of love (Huh)
]
Now he says he doesn't know me, no-no-no-not
And if you have seen me it is supposed that in the past it was
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other (Lego)
Now he says he doesn't know me, *no-no-no-no-not *
And if you have seen me it is supposed *that in the past it was *
I do remember when *we did *
*When in bed we killed ourselves*

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
You let yourself manipulate, you don't know how to love
You say that you hate me ', but you are not going to "
You know that your leg 'I put them to tremble
I devoured you and you started 'to shout
If love dies they betray you
They love you, leave and hate you
And in death is like person '
That leave you alone I later 'that they cry you
Talking to the moon like a wolf looking for his wolf
Looking for the demon who is devouring you in his bedroom
Talking badly about me as if I already died
Tell that unhappy to eat it as I ate it
And let you get wet as I made you come
You said that on top

Only I could reach him
Your body knows how to rise
And when your legs were trembling
You didn't say anything, no, no

[Pre-car: Ozuna & Arcángel]
I know that our love is yesterday
Do you think it's easy to look at your face and tell me ':
"I don't know you"? Well, 'tá to' well
Sooner or later the karma will fall to you, you will return
Solita, I know you're going to fall
Will call me again to do it again
Oh, baby, don't try ', I'm not going to wrap myself
Because they say, and I think, that Lucifer is a woman

[Choir: Cardi B, Cardi B & Ozuna, Cardi B & Anuel AA]
Now he says he doesn't know me, no-no-no-not
And if you have seen me it is supposed that in the past it was
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other

[Verse 2: cardi b & offset]
You ain't cherish shit when you had it

And I'M YEARS AWAY FROM BASIC
And i'm thousands away from avenge, but
One Thing Ain't Adding Up To Me
How you gon 'mess with a bitch that look up to me?

[Verse 3: offset]
I Cannot Let Up (Let Up)
Hug Like a Gucci Sweater (Sweater)
Ain't Nobody Drippin 'Wetter (Drippin')
I TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE A LETTER (I TOOK THE TIME)
We Worked Hard Out The Ghetto
I DON'T DESERVE YOUR HART, KNOW YOU FED UP (NAH)
We Bh Had A Broken Heart When We Met Up (EH)
Your Body on Piece of Art, You Don's Sell It (UH)
You know that i miss it, i just Wanna Kiss it
I Scroll Through The Phone, Lookin 'How We Would Kick It (Kick It)
Knock at The Door, It's a Visit (Huh)
She Take That Shit Off The I Fuck in the Kitchen (Smash)
His and Hers, Mr. and Mrs. (Hey)
WHEN I TALK TO HER BABY GIRL LISTENS (listen)
I had Dream and You Was In It (Dream)
WHEN YOU GONE, I Feel Like I Been Sinnin '
Eat back, eat back, eat back (eat back)
You Not Really Rich, Got The Bomb Pack (Bomb)
Dive in the Water, have fun with that (dive)
I MIGHT PUT TO DAUGHTER OR SON IN THAT (I MIGHT)

She like the triangle Balenci Bag (Drip)
You know you an angel, eat the Bad (Angel)
If you really love me then take me back

[Pre-car: J Balvin & Ozuna]
J Balvin, Man
I know that our love is yesterday
Do you think it's easy to look at your face and tell me ':
"I don't know you"? Well, 'tá to' well
Sooner or later the karma will fall to you, you will return
So-so-alone, I know you're going to fall
Will call me again to do it again
Oh, baby, don't try ', I'm not going to wrap myself
Because they say, and I think, that Lucifer is a woman

[Choir: Archangel, J Balvin & Ozuna, J Balvin & Anuel AA]
And now he says he doesn't know me, no-no-no-not
And if you have seen me it is supposed that in the past it was
I do remember how we did it
How in bed we killed each other
