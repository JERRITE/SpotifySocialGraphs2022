I Hit These Licks for You Momma Lyrics[Intro]
T-t-to Bass be the glory

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Five for the Xan
Ten for the Perc'
Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve
Five for the Xan
Ten for the Perc'
Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve
[Verse 1: Bass Santana]
I heard some niggas talking, fuck it, they can be about it
I heard that they gon' run up on me, we'll see about it
I miss my momma like a bitch, I need to see the island
But I can't stand to look her in the face as unaccomplished
I'm makin' beats, a couple bangers, think I'm onto somethin'
But niggas sleepin' like they got class in the morning
I got the heat, it got my hands on the choppa, hands on the choppa
Make a nigga dance for the fuckin' corner
And everybody hate my temper, shit, I hate it too
But when you put it on the internet they say it's cool
Ay, fuck it, I'm just trying to get a check, I played a fool
See, I'm just doing all the shit you niggas 'fraid to do
These niggas lazy, puttin' work is what they hate to do
You try to tell a nigga better, he start hatin' you
You need to focus on yourself, I'm unavailable
Being pussy is fatal, just think about it and say the truth
Wait, I massacre rappers
After that a tragic disaster
Have a chat with the pastor
Say a prayer then I close the chapter
I keep it no competition and that's the code to snappin'
A lot of niggas fake, I guess that's just the code of rappin'
These lames more annoying than some light skin backwoods
A bunch of rein actors
I fuck his bitch and then I treat him like a fetus after
He get aborted like the mission under heat in action
That's where you niggas lackin'

Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve
Five for the Xan
Ten for the Perc'
Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is wait
Five for the Xan
Ten for the Perc'
Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve

[Verse 2: Yoshi Thompkins]
All you niggas rollin', all my niggas ride high
No one can pick you up if you are upside down
You ain't got no game, stay yo' ass out of bounds
Hard to stay afloat, walk the plank, hope you drown
Imagine if I changed history, I'm yo' master now
Imagine if I didn't rap, I'd have a master's now
It's a thousand lil' niggas wanna be the Yoshi now
I call them my flower children, we shinin' like daffodils, aye
My garden rich with the fertilizer, so watch the snakes
Yo' homie say he a fucking Kane, he a fucking Cobra
Now plant a stash over there in the corner, I bet he'd take it
Don't wanna smoke with them, I'ma face it, he probably laced it
These niggas heartless, they start problems, I gotta face 'em
You never [?], I'm gon' erase you
Don't be Jamaican, in the next life you'll probably make it
Don't swear to God, just like my God will visit Jamaica
Is there gon' be a awkward moment in this conversation?
We gon' keep it G codin', crackin' combinations
What's in that safe? I need it all, unless yo' hood ain't say
I trip on acid, say the shit they say I shouldn't say
With the rhymin', I'm a Shining Son
Shinin' is a natural mist, they commin' with us when I was atomic
But I'm fallin' from the sky, I'm a comet
Told my mama she ain't gotta worry 'bout the money 'cause it's comin'
[Chorus: Bass Santana]

Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work

Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve
Five for the Xan

Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is wait
Five for the Xan
Ten for the Perc'
Bitch, I ain't rich till my mama don't work
Bands in the app, hoes gettin' on my nerve
Hands in the trap, all my niggas do is serve3Embed
