Right Side of My Neck Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you can't change your haircut
But it looks good anyway
I kinda wonder where you got it
And I doubt you even paid

[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
[Verse 2]
I wonder if you got home
But we just said goodbye
You looked back at me once
But I looked back two times

[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

[Outro]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neckYou might also like3Embed
