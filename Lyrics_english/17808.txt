C.A.B. (Catch A Body) Lyrics[Intro: Fivio Foreign]
Yeah, huh
She know when the demon comin' to party, bruh
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Mami, you sad, she wanna sit, but she on the pole
She understand that she gotta give if she wanna glow
Crashin' the whip, whiter than snow, fresh out the boat
She tryna fly, now we on a trip, somewhere in Dubai (Ayy)
She lovin' the life (Ayy)
So high in the buildin', look down at the sky (Ayy)
Girl, that pussy crazy, you know my mind ain't right
I know that she ready, she'll find out tonight
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a feelin' we finna be close
I got a feelin' you already know
Baby, let me take control
You ain't gon' be solo no more
Know you see me (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Fivio Foreign]
Iced out for the party (Party)
Shots got me feelin' saucy tonight
If I fuck your girl, I'm not sorry (No, sorry)
I ain't cuffin' anybody
Tonight, I'm on go, go (Party)
'Cause I can fuck with anybody
Tonight, I'm on go, go (Sorry)
I'm just tryna catch a body tonight (Yeah, look)

[Verse 2: Fivio Foreign]
I got it on me when I link her (I got it on me when I link her)
Huh, she like that (She like that)
She want me to fuck her, I might pass
But I still fell in love with her nice ass (Oh)
I see a opp, he see the gun and a light flash (Grr)
Baow (Baow)
They know I'm in love, but I'm still a demon
You better not get me in my bag (Yeah, look, uh)
And we don't kiss when we in front of the bros
I leave the party and come to the shows
You've been through the worst, she ain't even fold
Say your mans had it, he ain't even blow (Baow, baow, baow)
Uh-huh, yeah
I'm one of a kind, ain't too many more, uh (Ain't too many more)
That shit I've been through made me grown (Grown, I don't care, uh)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
(Come here)
Grip on her ass, kiss on her lips, I'm grabbin' her throat
She doin' to me a couple things I didn't know
She got a dragon tatt on her back down to her legs
Hit it, spread them wings, spittin', spittin' flames
Nice, I talk to her nice
I'm gon' eat her twice, she gon' take my mic
Speak up, hi, make her sing my line
Leave her in the sky, let's do it
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got a feelin' we finna be close
I got a feelin' you already know (You know)
Baby, let me take control (Yeah)
You ain't gon' be solo no more (No more)

Tonight, I'm on go, go (Party)
'Cause I can fuck with anybody (I can, I can)
Tonight, I'm on go (Go), go (Go, sorry, baow, baow)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl, you can't wear no clothes
Look at you drivin' the boat out at sea
Droppin' it off like, "Woah"
'Til you can't take anymore (Tonight, I'm on)
Dick make you weak, curl your toes
Bet you, you comin' the most
Bet she gon' leave in the mornin'
I see a freak and I want it
I like that, all bad
Innocent, you'll never be
Whip it, this that recipe
Geeked off them amphetamines
We on, babe, on, babe
Coochie is my therapy
Gucci on my letterman
Two seats, I got head in it
This my weekend regimen (Come here, yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Fivio Foreign]
Iced out for the party (Woo, party)
Shots got me feelin' saucy tonight (Uh)
If I fuck your girl, I'm not sorry, no (Uh, sorry, baow)
I ain't cuffin' anybody (Yeah)
Tonight, I'm on go, go (Yeah, party)
'Cause I can fuck with anybody (Ha)
Tonight, I'm on go (No), go (Grrrah, sorry)
I'm just tryna catch a body tonight (Baow, baow)1Embed
