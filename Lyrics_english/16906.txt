I Just Canâ€™t Handle It Lyrics[Intro]:
(Tony)
Her smile
She was beautiful
The way she held me in her arms
Made me feel so young

(Marcus)
Yo, what you doin' man?
You are young, man
Yo T, you hear this man?
What is he talking about?
This girl got him strung out again, man
She's too old for you, man
She's 25 years old
You're only 16, man
What you trying to do?
Come over here and sing this, man...
Bridge: (Tony)
Cutie tried to flip me
She tried to blow my mind
I was only 16
She was 25
I was walking to school
When she caught my eye
Surely looking good...

Chorus:
She was so fine
She had that funky walk
Her smile
Make me wanna hear her talk
(She said)
She said she would do anything just so she could hear me scream

Just can't handle it
(What am i gonna do?)
Just can't handle it
(What excuse could I use?)
Just can't handle it
(She's got me so confused)

Bridge: (Tony)
Thought she was bluffing
Just messing with my head
So i forgot about school
Went to her place instead
She started to undress
As i looked at her thighs
I can't pass this test 'cause this girl is sooo fine
