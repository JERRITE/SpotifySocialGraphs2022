Whole Lotta Money Lyrics[Intro]
Whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money (Skrrt)
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, you can't hold nothin' from me
I gotta whole lotta money, I gotta whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, I gotta whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money, uh

[Verse 1]
Word around town: I'm the MVP (MVP)
I'm the who the young boy watch, yeah, they envy me
They watching on my clocks, yeah, they jockin' me (Okay though)
They keep me on they wall, yeah, they acknowledge me
And I be strapped up to my drawers to my fucking cleats
They buying all my stocks, yeah they invest in me
Need 50 from the front, we gon' play for keeps (Okay though)
But I skipped outta college to get them dollars
[Chorus]
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
You can't hold nothin' from me

[Verse 2]
Crazy what that money do
It change the people who bring up under you
Rearrange somethings, I had to humble you
You looking strange to me, I'm ready to rumble you
I got diamonds on me, did that dash with my homie
They be spazzing on me, pass the chrome to the homie
I be slidin' homie, can't get caught slippin' on me
Homie had to make it home, can't get love by my lonely

[Chorus]
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
I gotta whole lotta money, whole lotta money
You can't hold nothin' from me (From me)You might also like1Embed
