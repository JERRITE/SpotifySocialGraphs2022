Revolusion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ma! Surrounding tain my brain
I'm just a city kid who fall a lot
Just one distraction will show the pain
From this a sugar rush in cold game

[Verse 2]
I'm here to do revolusion
This is a test, not lookin for a home
But for a place to die
Do you dare to be scared in this street?
Then you wanna meet tonight?
[Chorus]
Get one foot in, keep one foot out
It's all about, let's rumble and shout
Now! Now, now, now!
Revolusion!
Now! Now, now, now!
Revolusion!

[Bridge]
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Say! Say! Say!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!
Revolusion!

[Verse 3]
I got all to give what you lose
In this my body hmm, is a proof of your fire
Look at me I am a teen wolf, playing in the green
We alone among friends and lick our broken dreams

Get one foot in, keep one foot out
It's all about us rumble and shout
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!

[Outro]

Say! Say! Say!
Revolusion!
