Electric Worry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you made me weep and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life no more
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
Where I lay my head, that's where I call home
Whether barren pines, or the mission stare
Take tomorrow's collar and give 'em back the glare

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
[Verse 2]
You told everybody in the neighborhood
What a dirty mistreater, that I was no good
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life no more
Doctor or lawyer, I'll never be
Life of a drifter, only life for me
You can have your riches, all the gold you saved
Ain't room for one thing in everybody's grave

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos

[Verse 3]
If I had money like Henry Ford
Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah, on every road
But someday, baby, you ain't worry my life no more
Invocation of the dummies, requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner, piles of street cred
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
One day, baby, you'll worry me no more

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonos
Bang, bang, bang
Vámonos, vámonosYou might also like3Embed
