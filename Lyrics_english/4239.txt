ZUN DA DA LYRICS ["ZUN DA DA" letter]]

[Pre-Car 1]
Your encounter is not a casual, for me it is a bit illogical
In my life a historical act
You have taken me to travel, you are my platonic love
And I traveled here for a reasonable price
Your lips definitely have something magnetic
I must take something energy
I don't want this magical moment to fall
That's why I get romantic
[Chorus]
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada

[Verse]
I will look at you, because I
Looking at my face, I realize that I'm dying to touch you
Like me
I dreamed you on every night that revealed me, mommy, without your heat
But not
I threw my dreams on the floor and although I almost died, I found you (I found you, I found you)

[Pre-Coro 2]
I will kiss you until I feel yours
And I will invent a world for both
I will hug you and feel my heat
We will do sex with clothes, this will be between you and me
I will kiss you until I feel yours
And I will invent a world for both
I will hug you and feel my heat
We will do sex with clothes, this will be between you and me
Let's dance and me

[Chorus]
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada
ZUN DADA, ZUN DADA
Zun Dada, Zun-Zun Dada
