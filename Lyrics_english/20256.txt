Light It Up (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Major Lazer]
Danger them is, while some call them "Major Lazer"

[Verse 1: Nyla]
Stand up like a solider, baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster, baby
Show dem say you're wicked like that

[Refrain: Nyla]
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free
[Pre-Chorus: Nyla]
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me

[Chorus: Nyla]
Light it up!
Light it up!
Light it up!
(Light it up, light it up)

[Verse 2: Fuse ODG]
Show them you're flame to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up, now your aims getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day I'mma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere
