Song to Sing When Iâ€™m Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again
No one to face when I'm falling
Holding tight to dreams that never end

[Chorus 1]
I'll be you, I do, I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyone's reason, everything dying and leaving
[Post-Chorus 1]
Out with these faults and you make me a baby
Faking a movement by no one seeing it
No one always finds peace flung
No one chooses to beat my pride down

[Verse 2]
Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up
Somewhat to fate accumulates
Loving pain to be clung to

[Chorus 2]
By luminous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong and true to us
Out of place in my own time, drowning thinking that I'm dry

[Post-Chorus 2]
Holding on to facts that will never be proven
Faking an action 'cause no one is looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feel nothing when my life flashes before my eyes

[Outro]
Should've threw me down is the content so much
Should've threw me down is the content so much
(I'll be you, I do) Yeah
(I'll be you) Should've threw me down is the content so much
(I'll be you, I do) Yeah
(I'll be you) Should've threw me down is the content so muchYou might also like5Embed
