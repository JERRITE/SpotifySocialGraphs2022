High Like This Lyrics[Intro]
(High like, high like, high like)

[Verse 1]
Been a long time comin' and a long time gone
Yeah, I'm leavin' this town with my gun still drawn
Got an old Camaro with the backseats pulled
I don't need no money 'cause I got someone

[Chorus]
When you're high like this
You can pay me roll, roll, you can line it with gold
When you're high like this
Take it to the west coast, put me in your time zone
I could die like this
Keep me in this moment and my heart is fucking loaded
When you're high (High) like (Like) this
[Drop]
When you're high like this
When you're high (High) like (Like)

[Verse 2]
Got an old jeans jacket, used to be my dad's
Make me feel like Brando in the One-Eyed Jacks
And I'll call you up by the highway's edge
You said that you'll be waiting on the front porch steps

[Chorus]
When you're high like this
You can pay me roll, roll, you can line it with gold
When you're high like this
Take it to the west coast, put me in your time zone
I could die like this
Keep me in this moment and my heart is fucking loaded
When you're high (High) like (Like) this

[Drop]

[Chorus]
High like this
You can pay me roll, roll, you can line it with gold
When you're high like this
Take it to the west coast, put me in your time zone
I could die like this
Keep me in this moment and my heart is fucking loaded
When you're high (High) like (Like) thisYou might also like2Embed
