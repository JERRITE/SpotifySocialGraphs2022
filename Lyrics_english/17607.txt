All I See Is You (DJ Afrojack Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I open up my eyes and I
Still can't seem to find the light
Walk to the darkness you were right
I am searching every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I follow around, I try to hide
Until the time I see your eyes
In the darkness, you are light
I'll be searching every night
[Chorus]
All I see is you
All I see is you
All I see is you
All I see is you
All I see

[Post-Chorus]
All I see is you
All I see is you

[Verse 2]
I opened up my eyes and I
Still can't seem to find the light
I've been thinking black and white
You told me I would be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it shimmer, see it shine
In front of me you glow so bright
In the darkness, you are light
I'll be searching every night

[Chorus]
All I see is you
Darkness falls, your light is shining through
All I see is you
Brighter lights, no matter what you do
All I see is you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
All I see is you
All I see is you
All I see is you

Darkness falls your light shining through
All I see is you
Brighter lights, no matter what you do
All I see

[Post-Chorus]
All I see is you
All I see is youEmbed
