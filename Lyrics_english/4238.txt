Caile Lyrics ["Caile" ft letter. Zion & de la Ghetto]

[Intro: Bad Bunny & de la Ghetto, both]
I want to make you come another '(another sees')
I want to see you again, baby (UH-OH-OH)
I download your foot '(wuh)
For just seeing you fucking another sees'

[Chorus: Zion & Bryant Myers]
Caile, so dancing me
I want to give you hard as e '
You only fall, so that I dance
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, eh
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, eh
I want to give you hard as e '(Bryant Myers)
[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
My movie is in play, you've already seen the trailer ', caile
Today I want you to dance '
I look for you in the BM, your jevo looks for you at Chrysler
LOW PA'L APARTMENT
You want to make love without being loved
Dévorame, devorame until heat drops spill
I'm going to be your slave
You like A-A-Amanecer in County
And you will put it in the floor suite of the eighth number
You like the kid ', haha
Mera, Baby, I have kid '
I never go, I always go out with 100 bandits like the end

[Verse 2: zion]
You already know me '
You know my name well
You know 'that when I fall for him to shout' my name
You know 'that I am the man who Bellaca puts you
That Bellaca puts you (Z-Diddy)

[Chorus: from the ghetto & zion]
Caile, so dancing me
I want to give you hard as e '
You only fall, so that I dance
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, eh
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, eh
I want to give you hard as e '

Well, tell me, Baby, what do you want '?
You fall if it can '
To dance 'in the tube all' the night 'that entertain you
Half libreta of sour and paca 'of Ciene'
I do it 'all night when I mix to' the powers, yah
In it I invest what I earn in the partie 'de to' the Weekends
In love with that ass because how in four very rich it moves it
I send her to look, I put it to fuck in 'the different Hotele'
It seems that he has a demon, not for 'e tremble when he is coming
Baby, you know that I am not doing '
You fall, when I give you comfortable
I like that, yes, they don't stop asking-dir
To continue giving until he gets tired of coming

[Chorus: Zion & de la Ghetto]
Caile, so dancing me
I want to give you hard as e '
You only fall, so that I dance
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, ey-yeh
I want to give you hard as e '
Ah-na-na, eh, ah-na-na, ey-yeh
I want to give you hard as e'-eh-eh

[Verse 4: Bad Bunny & Zion]
Pa 'ti and pa' me I have sei 'phillie' enrolled '(enrolled')
Caile the presidential in County
What you did to me have not forgotten (no)
You ere 'my stripper, I want a private
Baby, make me your choreography
That booty is pornography, Yeh
Why did you porph me '?
If you know that I know your biography
I know that in men I don't trust '
But that ass I trust '
Caile, Moët is already cold
Baby Rasta clashes you the trust
Pa 'ti and pa' me I have sei 'phillie' enrolled '
Caile the presidential in County (Wuh, Wuh)
What you did to me have not forgotten
You are my stripper, I want a private (cai—)
[Chorus: Zion]
Caile, so dancing me
I want to give you hard as e '
You only fall, so that I dance
I want to give you hard as e '
