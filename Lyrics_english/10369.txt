The Little Things (Kasbo Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could feel it coming back
I didn't know, was I built to last
I know you think you could do, too
I know you think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life that I feel

[Chorus]
I know you think you could do, too
I know you think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life
I know you think you could do, too
I know you think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life that I feel
[Verse 2]
I could be better still
Than anything I've done
I know you think you could do, too
I know you think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life that I feel
