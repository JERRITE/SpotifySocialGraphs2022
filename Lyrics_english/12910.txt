Ode To Dance Floor LyricsHear up, listen up
Too soon it's gone forever
It's a shame, who's to blame
Where's my seven seventy seven

Like a wind, a breeze, a morning among tsutsujis
It tickles, you smile, and then it never was

A wild patience has taken me this far
But time is something I can't get my head around
A dream, a memory
We had a blast, remember?
I always had a crush on you, but now I'm getting older
Jackie, Jackie, what's the story? Put in lots of hope and glory
Tell me that I shouldn't worry, that lovers will be lovers always
Tell me things including pink, that China is considered hip
Pour me some and I drink up from your flower honey cup

Jackie, Jackie
You bring on the good times, good times
Can it be my waiting is over?
Ooh, we got something going

Nostalgia isn't ready with me yet
I wanna hold the moment desperate and tight
I wanna dance til I sweat
Turn up the music, everybody dance
If we come to party, we might just celebrate
And if I'll never have you, and if you'll never be mine
It will linger in my body, it'll be written in my palm

Somewhere, somehow, I lost you in the riot
In a suburban sunset at a suburban street sign
Never altered, glowing still like the oldest light
My love for you will never, ever go out
My love for you will never, ever go out
My love for you will never, ever go out

What did it become of us, why is that night no more
When seven people listened to our ode to a dance floor
And I set the alarm off 'cause I love smoke machines
And you, you had your heart broken
Somewhere in between a slow stepper and a shudder
You might also likeShe said you couldn't call her
It all got so dramatic, it truly was fantastic
Dreidre, you still mad at me for putting out a dream?
Like a cig thrown out a window and landed in your drink

Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me
Turn it up now let me

Time, time, time, is not a friend of mine
I can't believe we meet like this just to have to say goodbye
I know what a beginning is but I don't get the end
Will someone turn the lights down and put the DJ on again!

Sometimes when I look at you it's like I'm about to burst
Cause I love you 'til my heart breaks and I love you 'til it hurts

You sparkle like confetti
Shalifa Zizzi Rock
My mother tiger, my beauty queen, my fairest Lancelot
Look at you all, you're like new classics
Grander than the grandest wax is
Brand new every time I see you
Rhythm is a-runnin' through you

Oh, you got the music in you, you will never grow old
Blazing from the inside, you will always roll
Cause you're like no other, you're like Nasty 1
I think I got you figured out, and then you have me stunned

On a silver jet, you ride into your fate
With a heart young of fuel and your soul a Wolf Rayet

My love for you will never, ever go out

Let me hold this moment, don't let it go just yet
Light up the air around me and blind me with yourself
I know there's no forever, and I know you have to go
You shine like you're made of lasers
You shine like you're made of lasers

And then leave me in the glow of you
Leave me in the glow of you
Leave me in the glow of you

C'mon baby
What good is forever if I can't have you?
Leave me in the glow of you

C'mon baby
What good is forever if I can't have you?
Leave me in the glow of you

Leave me in the glow of you
Leave me in the glow of you
Leave me in the glow of you
Leave me in the glow of you2Embed
