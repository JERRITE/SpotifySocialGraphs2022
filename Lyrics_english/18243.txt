Birthday Suit Lyrics[Intro]
*moaning*
(Noise)

[Verse 1]
Here's your special cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Watch me throw it in the air
Pocket full of ones with the zeros in a pair
Find myself starin' at your waist
Waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, (Oh-oh, oh) waist, waist
On my Superman shit
X-ray visions while you shakin' those hips (Shakin' that shit)
[Chorus]
I just wanna see you
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin

[Verse 2]
Baby, it's your special day
Day, day, day, day, day, day
You already know, paddlin' a boat, the way I make your river flow
Baby, you gon' make me take a break (Break)
Oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe
Back at it again, money ain't a thing, baby, I made it to spend

[Chorus]
So just get in your
In your birthday suit (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, (Yo, check it) don't be scared (Huh)
Kissin' on your skin, girl, before we begin

Girl, take off your outfit, call my place a dressing room
I be on that pussy but before my mind's undressing you
My stride Martin Luther with the brain like Luthor
Kryptonite in my pants, so her head go super
Ya man do you wrong, like he printed out a typo
Your body so crack, shit be whiter than albino
Your body so crack got me horny like a rhino
Shit, I know you seen wood like pine glow
Trust me when I say I'll keep you sacred like Chi Lo
Trust me when I say I'll satisfy you till the night go
Girl, you already know the best damn part is
Get you on your back wax, you like Kelly Clarkson
Officers, bad girl, you're so wanted
To be honest, got a rocket in my pocket
Won't you want it, baby, I just want you on it, babe, oh whoa

[Chorus]
In your birthday suit
Take it all off (Take it all off), I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared (Ohh, ohh, ohh, yeah)
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin
In your birthday suit (Oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe)
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
In your birthday suit, don't be scared (In your birthday, in your birthday, in your birthday)
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you, baby, in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared (Ohh, ohh)
Kissin' on your skin, Girl, before we begin (Yeah, aye)
[Outro]
Oh, aye, oh
In your birthday suit
Birthday suit, ohh
Ohh yeah51Embed
