Everything was fine lyrics [letter of "everything was fine (Ft. Manuel Medrano)"]

[Verse 1: Carlos]
And how good it would be to know each other
In the middle of the noise, among so many people
Return to the first time I had you in front
The first word you dedicated to me

[Pre-Caro: Manuel, Carlos, both]
How beautiful it would be to come back
Where nobody returns and we were fleeting (yes, yes)
And start knowing
As if you had never done it
[Coro: Carlos, Manuel, both]
And stay to live
When everything was fine, when you wanted to see me
It was the time, it was to not return
When everything was fine (so good)
When you wanted to see me
Although it was very cold at the tip of your feet (Yeah)

[Post-Coro: Manuel, Carlos]
I like when we go to the beach
We see the sea together through the window
We measure the size of the waves
We surf in bed at all hours

I like when you made coffee (you made coffee)
Although you will only have tea
And we were awake all night

[Verse 2: both, Carlos, Manuel]
Every day there is a dawn
But I never see it (but I never see it)
I stay dreaming, with you
Because all your kisses are of a different color
That is never repeated, constantly changes (which goes)
And start knowing
As if you had never done it (as if you never had)

When you wanted to see me
Even if it was very cold at the tip of your feet
When everything was Bie-eh-eh-eh-in (when everything was fine)

[Post-Coro 2: Carlos, Manuel, both]
I like when we go to the beach (to the beach)
We see the sea together through the window
We measure the size of the waves
We surf in bed at all hours
I like when you made me coffee
Although you will only have tea
I miss kissing me all night

[Outro: Manuel, Carlos]
I like when we go to the beach
We see the sea together through the window
I like when you made me coffee
Although you just take Teembed
