Superpowers Lyrics[Verse 1]
A second or a day
It's hard to tell when we're together, don't tell her
We're in a car without a break
About to lose it all but that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh
I'm touching rooftops, light from the skyline
Oooh
I'm walking on fire all because of you
[Chorus]
Superpowers, give me superpowers
Superpowers, all because of you
Superpowers, give me superpowers
Superpowers, all because of you
All because of you

[Verse 2]
You're such a beautiful mistake
And even if I could, there's nothing I would change
The way you're brushing through my face
It wouldn't be the same if we were playing it safe, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh
I'm touching rooftops, light from the skyline
Oooh
I'm walking on fire all because of you

[Chorus]
Superpowers, give me superpowers
All because of you
Superpowers, give me superpowers
Superpowers, all because of youYou might also likeEmbed
