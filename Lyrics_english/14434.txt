Desperate (I'm going to take) lyrics [desperate letter (I'm going to take) "]

[Intro: Joey Montana]
You will ask yourself
Why do I call you if I swore that never again
I was going to look for you, but I couldn't take it anymore
My heart shouts for me to grab
This damn cell phone and ask you how are you

[Pre-Caro: Greeicy]
Imagining who devils you will be
Thinking so much makes me want to drink
This bottle gives me strength to forget
The desire to look for you
[Chorus: Joey Montana]
That's why I'm going to take
To get my head that I still love you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I'm desperate to have you by my side
That's why I'm going to take
To get my head that I still miss you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I'm desperate to have you by my side

[Verse 1: the dandee & cali]
Cali and the Dandee, me '
Oh, you are going to kill me
Without you I feel empty, I'm going to look for
I need you here with me, Seamo 'Friend'
Let's go to the park where I tell us 'Kisito'
Give him, I need you
That I need you, I need you
Open the door whenever you want
You know it's raining outside
You know 'I'm getting wet
With tears of the icebox
And how much would I be for me (ah)
But you left first (woh-oh-oh)
That's why I call again, that's why I try again
That's why I cry again

That's why I'm going to take
To get my head that I still love you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I'm desperate to have you by my side, Yeah
That's why I'm going to take (that's why I'm going to take)
To get my head that I still miss you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I'm desperate to have you by my side

[Verse 2: Greeicy]
Greeicy, Greeicy
I want to take a rich swallow that helps me forget
That these are the crazy people who want to try you
I just can not take it anymore
But I still don't know if I can forgive you
Is that I lost confidence in you
I don't know if I can recover it
Because I already understood, when love is damaged
And what to try?
What was damaged, was damaged, and what do you try?
What ended, it's over, what today to fix it?
What happened to us, it hurt
He hurt me a lot, but today I look for something to forget

[Chorus: Greeicy & Joey Montana]
That's why I'm going to take
To get my head that I still love you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I am desperate, crazy and in love
That's why I'm going to take
To get my head that I still miss you
Well, I want to look for you anywhere
I'm desperate to have you by my side
[Outro: Joey Montana]
That's why I'm going to take
