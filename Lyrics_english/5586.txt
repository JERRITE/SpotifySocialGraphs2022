Songs I Can’t Listen To Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a song that I love
That you once played for me
It had all the right chords
And a sweet melody
It was back when we started
When there was mystery
Now they've all been erased
On my music machine
[Chorus]
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to

[Verse 2]
And do you still sing alone
When you're all by yourself?
Or do you switch to the next one
Sing for somebody else?
And when you're cold, don't forget
How this song kept us warm
You would dance on my bed
I would lay in your arms

[Chorus]
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
You might also like[Bridge]
And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record
And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record

[Chorus]
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to1Embed
