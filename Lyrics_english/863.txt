Cristina Lyrics ["Cristina" ft letter. Shelow Shaq]

[Pre-car: Justin Quiles]
There is a lot of dementia the thing is good
Has what we were 'to do
There is a lot of dementia I enter my system
Has what we were 'to do

[Chorus: Justin Quiles]
There is a party after the party
What is called the After Party
With who? It is with my friend Mari
With who? It is with my friend Mari
There is a party after the party
What is called the After Party
With who? It is with my friend Mari
With who? It is with my friend Mari
[Post-Coro: Justin Quiles]
(Hello)
Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina (OH-OH-OH-OH), Cristina, Cristina called me
Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina, Cristina called me

[Verse 1: Sheloow Shaq & Justin Quiles]
My name is Cristina suddenly
Which is already in the apter-party consuming matina (blep)
Look for my mamita that I am here in the corner
Come pa 'that approves' my green vitamin (rrra)
And boom this has walked gambao '(aha)
I will have to repeat because I have given everyone (hmm)
To'a the doors flee, put canda'o
That this party does not end until Shelow is empty
Quiet, mommy, that I will say anything
That arrived 'to bed with the past note of note
I am your focus when you get it in you '
I want to throw a selfie at the 'of those buttocks'
Mari-Huana, hahaha

[Chorus: Justin Quiles & Nacho, Sheelow Shaq & Justin Quiles, Sheelow Shaq]
There is a party after the party
His name is the After Party (hahahaha)
With who? It is with my friend Mari
With who? It is with my friend Mari (ahh)
There is a party after the party
What is called the After Party
With who? It is with my friend Mari
With who? It is with my friend Mari

Juana, Mari, María Cristina
It smells like something is burning in the kitchen
Smoke to the lung 'and pa' the mind medicine
Well, good and a murderous note (Wuh)

[Bridge: Nacho]
Soft sativa (ah), puts you up (ah)
He sticks to you but does not tear you down (ah)
Instead of sleeping you activate you (ah), bargain, eh, bargain, eh-eh
Soft sativa (ah), puts you up (ah)
He sticks to you but does not tear you down (ah)
Instead of sleeping you activate you (ah), bargain, eh, bargain, eh-eh
(And I endures Mari al after party)
