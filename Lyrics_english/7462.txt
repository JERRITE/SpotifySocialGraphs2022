Back to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take me back, don't leave me
Don't be bad, don't hurt me
Listen to me when I say
I know what you did so
When you said you let go
Did you ever think of me?

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's going through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh I
It's goin' through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh I
[Chorus]
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me?
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me

[Verse 2]
There is something different
In the way you're speaking
Now you're harder to believe
I can tell you're distant
And I know the reason
Did you think that I won't see?

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's goin' through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh I
But it's goin' through my mind
That she's always in your mind
While I keep you there in mine, oh I
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me?
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me

[Refrain]
Give me a reason why you said good-bye
Give me a reason for the lonely nights
Give me a reason why you did that
No need to fall on your knees

[Chorus]
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Don't you come back to me?
I'm now a doubt
That heart has ever been found
So wait patiently
Come back to me, to me
[Outro]
Come back to me, to me
Come back to me, to me4Embed
