Control - Acoustic Version Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh boy I read the news today
And wondered what would Lennon say
Too many people toting guns
Too many mothers losing sons
And it just seems obscene to me
Just take them off them, obviously
It's not impossible to solve
All that is missing is resolve
[Verse 2]
How many children have to fall
Before somebody grows some balls?
How many daughters have to die
Not knowing what they did or why
A lonely shooter in a school
Pissed off with life, or just a fool
Can't have the means to take a hit
We need to talk about this shit

[Verse 3]
So please explain to me just how
Guns must be such a sacred cow
Amendment two was needed when
The country had militia men
That was two centuries ago
And time's have changed a little so
Amend the constitution back
Stop making children take the flak

[Verse 4]
It might be a Right, but it's so wrong, and Lennon
Put his finger on it when he wrote his song:
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You might also like[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Too many people toting guns
Too many mothers losing sons
How many daughters have to die
Not knowing what they did or why

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that
We can't end this
Time to change the rules
And take control

[Bridge]

[Verse 6]
So please remember Bailey Holt
15 years old and not at fault
Tuesday was just a normal day
Until some cunt blew her away

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that
We can't end this
Time to change the rules
And take control
[Verse 7]
I don't like Mondays, Mondays suck
Sometimes it's hard to give a fuck
But when you're angry or you're sore
It's not worth killing people for
So put the gun down think it through
It's not the brightest thing to do
There's only two ways this can end
You'll end up dead or in the penn

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that
We can't end this
Time to change the rules
And take control

[Bridge]

[Verse 8]
And I don't get the NRA
I just can't see the world their way
Imagine, like John Lennon said
That it was your child that was dead

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that
We can't end this
Time to change the rules
And take controlEmbed
