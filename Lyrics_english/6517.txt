New Bad Habit Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can feel the darkness around me
Hottie drives a little white Audi?
I don't know how, but you found me
Yeah she got my cell and my address
And she's the reaper in a black dress
Got myself in another mess

Blame it on the whisky
She don't even miss me
[Chorus]
She coming in hot, she a bad bitch
Cutting my heart like a savage
Trade in my soul, she can have it
Let me introduce you to my new bad habit

[Verse 2]
I got a disease, yeah I got an addiction
I'm down on my knees
Truth is stranger than fiction
If the drugs don't kill me
Then the loneliness will

I wanna breathe you in (Breathe you in)
I wanna be your fool (Be your fool)
I wanna be your drug
And I wanna lick your wounds

[Chorus]
She coming in hot, she a bad bitch
Cutting my heart like a savage
Trade in my soul, she can have it
Let me introduce you to my new bad habitYou might also likeEmbed
