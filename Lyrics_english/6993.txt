Pack Lite Lyrics[Verse 1]
See, I don't got the time or the patience to deal with your shit today
You've been walkin' around with a stank attitude like your shit don't stank
I don't give you no trouble on most days, but I will today
I been holdin' my tongue, got the right to be in my feels today

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I worked too hard, but I love you way more harder
I done had my share of bein' walked all over, now I'm smarter
You can think you right all you want, I see through you just like water
You can go 'head, puff up your chest, but it better not go no further
[Chorus]
Give me bad vibes (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you don't get your act together, you might have to
Pack light (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
And do you
Bad vibes (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
My patience runnin' low and you ain't got a lot of time
So pack light (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
And do you

[Verse 2]
Might say you can find somebody else, tuh, she can never be me
Just want someone, let you do what you want, uh, but that'll never be me
And I love to treat you right, but I'ma check you when you wrong
You can't tell me that you hear me when you scrollin' through your phone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I worked too hard, but I love you way more harder
I done had my share of bein' walked all over, now I'm smarter
You can think I'm wrong all you want, but that truth got you so bothered
You can go 'head, puff up your chest, but it better not go no further, ooh

[Chorus]
Bad vibes (Bad vibes, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you don't get your act together, you might have to (If you don't get your act together)
Pack light (Oh, woah-oh)
And do you (You)
Bad vibes (Bad vibes, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
My patience runnin' low and you ain't got a lot of time
So pack light (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
And do you

You don't get it, do ya?
I'm tellin' you I had enough (Ayy)
I can only take so much, ayy, ayy
Oh, you don't get it, do ya? (Ooh)
I'm tellin' you I had enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can only take so much, ayy, ayy, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Bad vibes
If you don't get your act together, you might have to
Pack light
Ooh
Bad vibes
You gon' probably be right back tomorrow, might as well
