Eat Lyrics [Lyrics for "Eat You"]

[Enter: BRAY]
How did I lose you if I never had you?
The most I could keep her
Sometimes not everything that goes down
The singleness has me in the clouds
I don't miss you as before
Here thinking as ignorant
Because I'm crazy about catching you
And I don't know how to ignore you, he
[Chorus: Brray]
Let me eat again
I will not go down, with you I raise myself
Let me eat again
You go 'alone, I'm alone and I dare

Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Mommy, don't leave it for later

[Verse 1: Jehza]
As before at the high, you started giving me like
Escaping your mai, from panty I have your size
I know that you like bi ', you are a whore you bring you
A drunk story went up, I shot him to see if he falls
She smells rich, kisses rich
Richer breast, it's mine since boy
She likes to apply her
That I break it, I eat it, the chew, ah
Sex fan, he calls me, he wants that
He kept me in contacts, emoji with cheese
'Toy Bellaco, I want that (ah-ah)
He is still stiff

[Chorus: Brray]
Hey, let me eat again
I will not go down, with you I raise myself
Let me eat again
You go 'alone, I'm alone and I dare
You might also like me to eat again
Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Mommy, don't leave it for later

[Verse 2: luar the l]
Like a game in you, I get lost and I'm going to go (yes)
I want to put the bug even if only Seamo 'Friends
To vo'a guide, your body and 'a Mercedes Benz
I vo'a put in four in the cayenne, and if your friend is, too
He leaves, tell me baby that wha ', and that transplant
Since you did your ass.
I admit it to you, I want to give you like Banshee 350
Quiet, your boyfriend will not realize
Account with me when you want punishment
Pa'l most expensive hotel I have cash
Vamo 'to make porn live
Your boyfriend fighting Sheesh, it's Sindo Smelebish
With you basketball game and when I put "Swish!"
I come to give you a roof, I vo'a loosen that culot
When the oxy 'explodes, I'm your artist, your bichote
You have the structure, you are hard
Demonia am your cure, triple x, I record you without censorship

[Bridge: Luar the L]
I come and you leave, ah
I just want to eat you and more na ', ah
I call you to download the beautiful
Pa 'break that there, and
[Chorus: Brray]
Hey, let me eat again
I will not go down, with you I raise myself
Let me eat again
You go 'alone, I'm alone and I dare

Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Mommy, don't leave it for later

[Verse 3: brray]
I engage that ass of yours (ey)
I give you love although everyone is in their own
That comments and murmurs are fucking
With you I'm going to's and I never run away
And what do I say no yes?, For you, I am and yes
In Bellacrisis with that pussy
Molly Ecstasis, Pure Fantasy
Forget why you are like this
(Ey) So daughtereputa
The mother of who discusses you
Eva was the one who ate the fruit
But with to 'and that does not educate you' (Sheesh)

[Bridge: Brray]
I don't miss you as before
Here thinking as ignorant
Because I'm crazy about catching you
And I don't know how to ignore you, he

[Chorus: Brray]

Let me eat again
I will not go down, with you I raise myself
Let me eat again
You go 'alone, I'm alone and I dare

Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Let me eat again
Mommy, don't leave it for later
