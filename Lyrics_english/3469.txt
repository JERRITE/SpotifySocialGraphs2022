One Two Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep your space
If you can't, stay up in your place
Get the fuck (Huh)
Out my face, bitch you in the way
Truthfully (What's up?)
I just might fuck your bitch today
Close your eyes (Ya dig)
Open up, suck this dick today
And I'm riding downtown with your bitch in an Audi
If you tell me to go get him, I got him
Saucin' like Rex bitch you know I be stylin'
She say she wanna come party, now she off a bean
And the perc, yeah, these bitches be wildin'
I want the top 'cause I know she got mileage
Come get yo bitch, 'cause she actin' too childish
[Chorus]
One, two
Who the fuck is you, bitch?
Three, four
Come and get yo ho, bitch
Five, six
Suck a nigga dick, bitch
Seven, eight
How that dick taste, bitch?

[Verse 2]
Chop chop
Pull up on the block like pop pop, ooh
Hop hop, party gon' jump like hopscotch, ooh
Drop top, fuck a lil' bitch then swap, swap, ooh
Knock knock, shut the fuck up bitch, stop, stop, ooh
I'm the shit, fuck a job, I ain't clockin' shit
Booted up (Hm), heavy metal, bitch I'm off the shits
Come here baby (Huh), eat me up like some chocolate
Middle fingers (Huh), fuck 12, they not stoppin' shit

[Chorus]
One, two
Who the fuck is you, bitch?
Three, four
Come and get yo ho, bitch
Five, six
Suck a nigga dick, bitch
Seven, eight
How that dick taste, bitch?
