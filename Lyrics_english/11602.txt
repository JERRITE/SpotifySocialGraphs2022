I’d Have to Think About It LyricsI know that I will love again
I'll meet someone and I'll make amends
I'm sure she'll be a gentleman
And I will be content

I know that I would be fulfilled
See the world and pay my bills
Have a drink and eat my fill
Of dinners and free will
But if you come to me
In my home with my three kids
If you'd asked me to leave
To be with you and split
Well I'd at least have to think about it
You never loved the same amount
You spent a week at my mother's house
And honest, I can tell you now
I'll love you more than my future spousе

And if you come to me
When I'vе promised to commit
If you told me that you loved me
And asked me for a kiss
Well I'd at least have to think about it

You are my Achille's heel
The weakness only I can feel
I've been a liar and you've been a pill
But I'd still have to think about it

Things just won't be the same
I'm scared to death that I'll scream your name
And still, there's not a thing that I'd change
And that's okay, when I think about itYou might also like2Embed
