Nicki Nicole: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 13 Lyrics [lyrics by "Nicki Nicole: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 13"]

[Chorus: Nicki Nicole]
When I see you
I see you pass, ah
I think about the 'moment'
We knew how to love
Take a call
Do not do nothing, there is nothing, ah
If you know very well, what
Among the do 'we spent one hundred
[Verso: Nicki Nicole]
Welcome pain, I invite you to be part
Love left for a while, he didn't want to wait for you
Really you and I are something separate
This happens to my heart trust you
I would give everything to return to the suede '
But don't go to the past, no matter how much you sing
Before 'and during, I call you again
He doesn't answer the phone, and I can't get rid of
Of you and, baby, does not escape 'from my mind
Hallucino with seeing you
With being able to keep you in mind
Maybe I made you cry more than once
Maybe I got to hurt you and then I healed you
I luxurized to play until I won
But I see you pass and I realize that

[Chorus: Nicki Nicole]
When I see you (when I see you)
I see you pass, ah (I see you pass)
I think of the 'moment' (I think)
That we knew how to love-ar-ar (that we did not know how to love)
Throw me a call (throw a call)
Do not do nothing, there is nothing (like nothing happens)
If you know very well, that (if you know very well)
Among the do 'we spent one hundred (a hundred)
