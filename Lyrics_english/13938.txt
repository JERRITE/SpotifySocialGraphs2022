Romantic Type Lyrics[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
Well I can see you standing there like you know what to do
You all think you know me but you haven't got a clue
Well I can see you looking but you're looking at the floor
But I don't think I really care, because you paid at the door

[Chorus]
It's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to like
And if you'd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to say, "Well I might let you stay"
[Verse 2]
I know that you want something and you want it from me
Everyone says we're the same but I just can not see
And I know what you're asking for 'cause I've just read the sign
Would paying once or maybe twice be really such a crime?

[Chorus: Matt Bowman & Jimmi Naylor]
It's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to like
And if you'd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to say, "Well I might let you stay"
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
It's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to like
And it's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to likeYou might also like1Embed
