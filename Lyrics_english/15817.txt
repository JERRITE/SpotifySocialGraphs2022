See you again Lyrics [lyrics of "see you again" ft. Bryant Myers & Anuel AA]

[Intro: Nio García]
I was crazy to see you
And contemplate all that again
And those lips that give me pleasure (Yeah)
Get into my bed
All that body that I know well
And do it and one, and again (Yeah)

[Chorus: Nio García]
Feel your body, don't waste time
That today has to happen (no)
It may be the last time we see each other again
Today it has to happen
[Verse 1: Nio García]
Don't wait for tomorrow (EH-YAH)
Take advantage of the fact that I command here (I am the one, you heard?)
He has a countryman (big tits')
I know for that Booty bastard (haha)
And so I convinced you, for house I took you (pa 'chingar)
You called me this weekend pa 'that again gives you
To make you come (you know '), a pair of percoce'
You called me this weekend pa 'that gives you again, Aoh

[Verse 2: Anuel AA]
Baby, I want to eat you again '
Don't waste time, I can die
We cross the way 'and I got tangled on your skin
And I can't forget your body on me
Jumping, screaming and bordering me (bordering me)
The time 'passing and you coming (coming)
Your man calling and you laugh (uah)
I feel like a devil by tempting you (uah)

[Bridge: Anuel AA]
Vo'a take pa 'new york with me (with me)
It is cold, but I am your coat (Oah!; Your coat)
Biting you, lambling and squeezing you (oah!)
I can't tell you a fuck because he left you alone (alone!)
You waiting lying spent the hours (hours)
And he getting dirty on another bedroom (Oah!)
You are my devil, howl, my wolf
OAH, OH-OAH

Bryant Myers
Fucking as if it were the last time
My entangled body on your feet on the floor number ten
Now we fuck at hotel, remember 'the first time
What takes you to a motel? I don't forget that night in the Yes, Ah
He throws me 'when you get out of the uni (ah)
Put one of the 'new pantys', join the perfumi
That I reserved a hotel in the 'state' uni (wuh)
I am your George Clooney and you my baby
And if tomorrow and 'the last sees' that I wathe' to chingar
Baby, you and I are not afraid to die
There are bullets with my name that want to kill me
Maybe today it is the last time you make me come
Oh, mommy, come up, move my waist and belly
You don't want me to stop, you want me to continue
I spit it out and get it with saliva
That when the toto mamo gives him the host in the hair 'of the chiva

[Bridge: Anuel AA]
(Uah)
Vo'a take pa 'new york with me (with me)
It is cold, but I am your coat (Oah!; Your coat)
Biting you, lambling and squeezing you (oah!)
I can't tell you a fuck because he left you alone (alone!)
You waiting lying spent the hours (hours)
And he getting dirty on another bedroom (Oah!)
You are my devil, howl, my wolf
OAH, OH-OAH
