Undress Rehearsal Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Ooh, la la la

[Verse 1]
You deserve more than a cameo
How are you not in my video?
Lets take it back to my studio
And we can let it roll tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, come with me now
Your scene's about to start
I do believe I can see you're a star
Don't know your name but you're made for the part
Cause you're perfect, babe
Time to work it, babe
[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Ooh, la la la, la la la la la la
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Ooh, la la la

[Verse 2]
No, you don't need to audition, babe
Don't need no headshots or pictures, babe
There's no contract to negotiate
So we should let it roll tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, come with me now
Your scene's about to start
I do believe I can see you're a star
Don't know your name but you're made for the part
Cause you're perfect, babe
Time to work it, babe
You might also like[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Ooh, la la la, la la la la la la
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Ooh, la la la, la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Stop, let the credits roll
On star status, need a telescope
Magazines, that centerfold
All the dudes like, "She could get it though"
She could get it though?
(She could get it though)
From the top down, like it sexual
See that wardrobe at awards show
Now it's your name in a envelope like

[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Hey everybody say
Ooh, la la la, la la la la la la
Everybody say
Ooh, la la la, la la, la la la
Everybody say
Ooh, la la la
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Let's go!

[Outro]
Se-xy gi-rl, let's undress rehearsal
Se-xy gi-rl, let's undress rehearsal
Se-xy gi-rl, let's undress rehearsal
Se-xy gi-rl, let's undress rehearsal
Let it ride out, let it ride out5Embed
