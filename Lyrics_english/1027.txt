Leaving My Love Behind Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know how we got to where we are
So far removed, I don't know where to start
'Cause I've been away for far too long
But I implore you, please hold on
I beg you, please hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Love don't come easy to us
And it's killing me to hang on
And hope it's enough
[Chorus]
So, I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

[Verse 2]
We used to wait up and talk for hours on end
And it's got me thinking that lately something's changed
'Cause I've been feeling you leaving
Cracks in conversations way too long
I'm barely holding on

[Pre-Chorus]
Love don't come easy to us
And it's killing me to hang on
And hope it's enough

[Chorus]
So, I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

Just let me go, let me go
Just let me go, just let me go
Baby, say the word and let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause I was just wondering
Could you tell me, is it all a waste of time?
Are you leaving my love behind?
Baby, say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something
I swear that I won't try to change your mind
If you're leaving my love behind
Baby, say the word and let me go

[Outro]
Just let me go, just let me go
Baby, say the word and let me go7Embed
