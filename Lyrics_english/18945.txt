Hate Your Guts Lyrics[Verse]
Take off in an angry spit
I'm tired of all this fucking shit
Fuck the people, fuck the world
And fuck you bitch, you think you cool
All this damn attention telling me you want some more
I don't wanna give no mo'
Yous a bitch and now you know
Fucking with the wrong mane, now shut up bitch, and suck my thing
Yous' a hoe, you fuck me up and now I'm bout to cut you slut
I hate, hate, hate yo guts, try to smoke my indica
You so fucking fake, I should've burned you at the stake
Walk with me bitch?
I don't think so
Imma make you my next victim
Death to me and death to you
I'll keep your soul, it's 1 + 2
I don't give a fuck, I think I learned my lesson now
Fuck these hoes, got to go, I'll put them all on the floor
[Hook]
I hate, hate, hate yo guts
I hate, hate, hate yo guts
Hate yo guts
Hate yo guts
I hate, hate, hate yo guts
I hate, hate, hate yo guts
Hate yo guts
