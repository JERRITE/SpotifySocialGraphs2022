Ok, All Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wake up in
The wrong side of my head
The little voices creep back in, but it's cool

[Verse 2]
Some nights the TV's on
Just so I don't feel alone
Which Office episode should I choose?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I lose my mind
I go places nobody can find
When I lose my way
I just look at myself in the mirror and say
[Chorus]
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right

[Verse 3]
Sometimes a traffic blur
Has got me using words
My mama's never heard, my bad

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I wanna throw
Everything I own right out the window
Doing things I know I can't take back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When I lose my mind
I go places nobody can find
When I lose my way
I just look at myself in the mirror and say
You might also like[Chorus]
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right

[Break]
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Sometimes I blank and then
I'm on your Instagram
I see you with your new man, but it's cool
(Hmm)

[Chorus]
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right
All right
[Outro]
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, hey, hey, yeah (Hey ya, hey)
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, oh, oh, oh  (Hey ya, hey)
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, hey, hey, yeah
(It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right, it's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right)
(Hey ya, hey)
Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey, oh, oh, oh
(It's fine, I'm fine, OK, all right, all right)Embed
