Ta to gucci (remix) lyrics [letter of "ta to gucci (remix)" ft. Brytiago, Rafa Pabön, Cosculluela, Darell & Chencho]

[Intro: Darell]
Oh oh
This is the real remix

[Pre-car: Chencho, Darell]
He says nothing is missing
This grows, he has what he dreamed (he knows')
No arrival time
To the good girl she told "Goodbye" (Ratatatá)
And now he wants to live what he didn't live before
And now ask sex and I want the same
[Chorus: Cauty]
’Tá to 'Gucci, Ey
She likes to smoke the crya
But always in pipe and pa 'the Munchies Sushi, hey
I got the guy half, but it merits it

So 'tá to' gucci, ey
As the Father I tell him "Cuchi-Cuchi", Ey-Ey
Has a friend Media Buchi, ey
So if Pa'l Threesome is activated, more 'na'

[Verse 1: Brytiago, Cauty]
He sent me a sexy video by Snapchat with the dog filter
Who comes first in bed; We have war
And the pair of dispensary the condoms in the portfolio
’Tá to’ Gucci, 'so much ’Dolce,' so much 'versa',’ tá to 'ferra'
The sure friend also points
Without throwing me, I break them at the two together
What if I am a Bellaco? Devil, Baby, what a question (ha)
A hijuepin always changed it 'e route
And do not fantastate to arrive-him
While I start you have to kiss-se
I live like this, I had to get used to me
I like both in four because they have rosita like the tussy (uh)
I whip with the Gucci (Ey-Ey)
I like to see her jump, the savanna 'squeeze
Inside I don't vo'a throwing
Don't go 'wrong
You Might Also Like [verse 2: Cauty]
(Young Cauty)
What kind at night awaits me
A little 'e hookah tids you
He went to get the kids, and I dropped into the condoms' e the portfolio
Quiet, if you want the 'I leave' and vamo 'Acapella (UH)
Good Morning, Hello
In his work experience he put, "Blow"
3 in the morning on the album, Ouh
The booty jumps to the rhythm of dem-bow

[Bridge: Cauty, Cosculluela]
They are getting another one, and I take away
I don't know how bad has not given me
She sticks and moves from La'o to La'o, to La'o
They think I am remove, but they are wrong (eh)

[Verse 3: cosculluela]
My knife, he liked R.D., Gucci sheets (AH)
And that the goal pa 'inside the duchi'
Pa'l Threesome (Wooh) is thrown out
Against the wall even though the plaster breaks
They say I'm the best although I have twenty seasons (haha)
Twenty -three wants me to record it but with the network (OH)
That turns off the 'looks' and pledge the' LED
I put him and shout, he smokes Krippy only in pipe
And I give him whenever I want, I don't get an appointment '
Because 'tá to' gucci, 'to good (' tá to 'good)
Mami, pa 'inside' and the disco metio 'the' tool '(brrr)
The one who comes to talk to me, to speak to me (hey)
He who gives me a parrot, can be carried a hundred (BRR)
[Choir: Cauty & Cosculluela, Cauty, Brytiago, Brytiago & Cauty]
And 'tá to' gucci, ey (ey)
She likes to smoke the crya
But always in pipe and pa 'the Munchies Sushi, hey
I got the guy half, but it merits it

So 'tá to gucci, ey
As the Father I tell him "Cuchi-Cuchi", Ey-Ey
Has a half -buchi friend
So if pa 'a threesome is activated, more' na '

[Verse 4: Rafa Pabón]
Well snatched '
The Krippy is giving him Patá
Even drops, but the note betrays her
That woman is P but not Pirata, S.A.T.A, SATA
When smokes P.A.T.A, Pata
Loose with the below
He fought with the boyfriend, to go out a fuck
SATA Ask for Cream Pa'l Tajo

[Bridge: Rafa Pabón, Cauty]
And I'm going to give it to him (I'm going to give it to him)
I told him, "squeeze the pot to take out the cream and may spread it" (sneak it)
If you have a corduroy vamo 'pa'l threesome, and you can get together
You can point, without asking
I'm going to press
And after I come, I'm going to pichear
And if Slide calls me, to reject (decline)

[Verse 5: Darell]
(Everybody Go to the DiscoTak!; Ratatatá!)
Mami, 'Tá to' Gucci and Louis Vuitton (ESO E 'like this)
Inside the wallet, the short one 'the button (pa'´que know)
Do not speak 'of movie, it's movie (there are)
That a long time ago has it 'in on (rat-ta-ta)
You and I have 'connection (that is like that)
Pégate for here, baby, without concern (by law)
I am waiting for the decision (OH-OH) to make
What do you want to 'make you?
That I am going to give you now (that is like that)
If I do it to you that you fall in love '(pa' that knows)
I don't lie to you, I'm talking to you 'E Cora'
Thirty -five thousand per party, and only sing half an hour
Much Gucci, a lot of Gucci, much Fendi
'Tá well, I'm crazy, but ma', you ere 'tremendi' (by law)
Pégate and you will bite the Bembi
And leave your boyfriend who has the Mercede 'Empty (OH-OH)
