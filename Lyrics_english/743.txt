[Verse 1: jon z, ele to the domain]
When is it ', when is it', when are you going to put on me? (Haha)
You know 'that you have me crazy (Yi)
I fell in love little by little (Yi)
Ma ', you took me out of focus (ah)
I know that it makes you 'crazy (ah)
When I kiss your mouth
You think about me and it's your turn '(Yi)
He sees me 'with another and clashes you
Maybe I threw my friend ', but what the fuck matters
In the bed it does not behave, it makes me come, it transports me
Ma ', I sing like Luis Fonsi (Yi)
She tells me: "I love you Jon Z"
Ma ', don't tell me anymore "Jon Z"
I have told you since I met you (Yah!)
Don't treat me like a famous (YI)
I see you with your friends I get jealous (yi-yi)
Come stay with me, I get nervous
To have you with me, I feel proud
[Chorus: Jon Z & Eladio Carrión]
I need you ma ', I go looking for you or arrives'
Oh oh oh! (His p'!)

(I need you ma ', I go looking for you or arrives')
Oh oh oh! (Eladio Carrión; UH-UH)
Oh oh oh oh! (Sendo bastard)

[Verse 2: Eladio Carrión]
Baby, I need you
I miss your skin, your heat, kiss ', the phillie' before cinecito
Giving yourself under the Airecito
You tell me "step" and I visited you
If you are squeezed ', baby, I deposit you
This is calm, Flow Pedro Capó
If you want Luis Fonsi Vamo 'Despacito
Soft, soft
That for your heart I have the key, like DJ Khaled (like DJ Khaled)
Knows, knows, how rich he knows
He wants me to record her, Baby, you know '(Baby, already knows')
And I have thousands, but baby, tell him
To all that you are my favorite
And although with your friends I hesitate
You ere 'mine and that nobody removes it

[Chorus: Jon Z & ele to the domain]
I need you ma ', I go looking for you or arrives'
Oh oh oh! (Sup '!; Or it comes)
Oh oh oh oh! (AH)
(I need you ma ', I go looking for you or arrives')
Oh oh oh! (His p')
