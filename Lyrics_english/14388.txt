Worst Case Scenario Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ok shoutout to my ex girls
Both of them
And even though they hate my shit, fuck it
I still love them
I had to do it my way
I took the highway
Now they tryna' back us up just like a driveway
But no thanks yeah
Man why you all up in my face
Bad bitch, contest, and you in last place go away
Ok they hate me when I'm off this shit
But they my gateway drug
See you the blame for this
My friends left me at the bar
And the crib is a little far
I'm tryna' call a cab but I ain't got no money on my card
So at this point I need a friend
Cause I ain't going home solo again
So I just went and gave it one more shot
And it went a little something like this
See I was like
[Hook]
Hold up, what's going on
Where you from
Did you come with a group or did your friends not come
There's a lot of girls here but you're the prettiest one
So uh, put your number in my phone though
Cause I ain't going home alone no
And I mean this in the best way
But you gon' be my worst case scenario

[Verse 2]
To keep it intimate
Yeah I'm feeling you
Call your number to make sure it's you
And I don't really say this often but I fuck with you
Please don't make me go and talk to someone new
And I know this will sound weird but trust I mean what I say
That I could see you everyday and still feel the same way
And if you with me go and tell me that it goes both ways
I hope this whole conversation doesn't sound cliche
Cause I done felt the chemistry
See you're the one I kept my eye on
I ain't with them petty hoes, nylon
And if you let me call the plays
Baby I'll take it to the pylon
We can go the distance, yeah we can get our miles on
What, whatcha say
Man I can tell by the look on your face
That she was digging it, I'm thinking ok
We should close our tab and we head that way
Yeah you had me like
You might also like[Hook]
Hold up, what's going on
Where you from
Did you come with a group or did your friends not come
There's a lot of girls here but you're the prettiest one
So uh, put your number in my phone though
Cause I ain't going home alone no
And I mean this in the best way
But you gon' be my worst case scenario

[Bridge]
And I don't know what's gotten into me
Think it's something to do with you
All of a sudden I got some energy
And I wanna waste it all on you

[Verse 3]
Okay I woke up in the morning
I was sober, rolled over
And saw you laying right here in this bed
And I don't really know what happen
In my head I started laughing
So I tapped you on the shoulder and said
Yeah you had me like
Hold up, what's going on
Where you from
Did I come with a group or did my friends not come
There were a lot of girls there, you weren't the prettiest one
But uh, take my number out your phone though
I'm about to take the cab alone though
And I mean this in the best way
But you this is my worst case scenario
Yeah I'm goneEmbed
