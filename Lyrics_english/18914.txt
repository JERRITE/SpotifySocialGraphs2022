She Rides Lyrics[Verse 1]
She rides
Let loose upon the world
She is the night
And my loneliness in bondage
She's black
And sin runs down her back
She rides
From the daylight in chains

[Chorus]
She rides the night
She rides the night
[Verse 2]
She slides
Down inside your skin
In time
She will make you scream
She's death
In a cool black dress
She rides
In the night of your mind

[Chorus]
She rides the night
She rides the night

[Post-Chorus]
Yea
She'll take you down
She'll take you
She'll take you around

[Verse 3]
She rides
Let loose upon the world
She is the night
And my loneliness in bondage
She's black
And sin runs down her back
She rides
From the daylight in chains
You might also like[Chorus]
She rides the night
She rides the night

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh yea
She'll take you down
She'll take you
She'll take you around1Embed
