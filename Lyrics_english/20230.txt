[Verse 1: Papa Pine]
If smoking weed gets you high
Then why not go down on a bitch when she's rollin' the pine?
Push me into the pussy
Not now, got a blunt to light
I might wanna fuck when the blunt is done
Pumpin' the cunt, and I won't jump the gun
Roll the whole O, ho, then blow me slowly
Gotta go when you done
Grip as I double the cup, sip a puddle of mud
Got one pint in my blood
Twelve O's got me real fucked up
Eyes roll back, I spill my drugs
Homies roll me up, then smoke me in the blunt
Bitch, I am nothing just ash in the cup
Hard to lay back in this grave that I dug
[Chorus: Gangsta Blac]
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
I just fucked your bitch in some Nike flip flops
Whipped the dope so hard until my fuckin' wrist locked
I just got a bundle of the heron out the east
Break it down and cut it, now I got a quarter ki'
Smokin' indo dope, no, you can't hit this, though
Cocaine, choppin' snow, I got that drip goin' down my throat
Always justify to get my urges satisfied
So let me clarify

[Chorus: Gangsta Blac]
Now, now, now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout
Now I'm high, really high, mane, I'm about to shout

[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh
Well, it's the $outh $ide $uicide
Buffet Boys, we worldwide
Global 'til the day I die
I love to see my bitches cry, it gets me off
Baby girl, you gettin' lost in the sauce
I don't talk to nobody, I don't got a boss
You sayin' you gon' shoot me, you don't got the balls
Or the guts to bust me in the temple
Why these rappers so sentimental?
Wake up in the morning like what was I meant for?
All of these ho's be trifling
All of them ho's is nymphos
They can fuck but don't give 'em my info, no
