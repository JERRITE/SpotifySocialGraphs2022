I love you Lyrics ["I love you" letter]]

[Verse 1]
I know I will not forget you
And I know that this goodbye will hurt us
The distance cannot erase dreams
What we feel, what we cry
Many memories
And if one day you want to come back
Here, I will be waiting for you
The distance cannot erase dreams
What we feel, what we cry
Many memories
[Chorus]
I love you, honey
And I never forget you
Although it spends a lot of time
I will not change my love for you
And nobody will love you like me
I love you, honey
And I never forget you
Although it spends a lot of time
I will not change my love for you
And nobody will love you as I love you
How I love you

[Verse 2]
Goodbye, because I don't see you again
And thanks for love, for yesterday
What a pity that everything is over
Because I love you
But fate
On two ways
He has sent us

[Chorus]
I love you, honey
And I never forget you
Although it spends a lot of time
I will not change my love for you
And nobody will love you like me
I love you, honey
And I never forget you
Although it spends a lot of time
I will not change my love for you
And nobody will love you as I love you
