TranslationEnglish I put badly (see it) lyrics [lyrics of "I put you bad (see it)"]

[Intro: Kali Uchis]
I know you want to eat me (I know)
Please don't fall in love (I already know)
I want to sweat, daddy, I want to shout
I do not see the boring full of envy
I have a flow that is worth gold
You show you, you want to try
A little of my treasure
Do not get obsessed
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Think about it if you want to burn
Stop it and go warm
Sit it that I get bad
Stop it, continue it
Think about it if you want to burn
Stop it and go warm
Sit it that I get bad
Stop it, continue it

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
Think about it, I want you to think about it (now)
That what they tell you is true
I know you can't control
I Could see it from a mile away
When you look at me with those eyes
Papacito, oh, how rich when I play
A little brandy, lemon and salt
Bitch, Don's Talk to me, you know that I like me (bad, bad, bad, bad)

[Verse 2: randy crazy note & kali uchis]
Enrola, take out and turn on (pledge)
My vibes with the Indo, I always smoke green (green)
Fine in your home and in the street a rebel (rebel)
You don't kiss him ', you bite it'
Creative, daddy, not 'rude
That the machina will be of sativa
This haughty perreo
The Pepa I gave you made you sensitive (it's that I'm sensitive)
Yeah, Demonia puts with my saeteo
Fold, put and take out in the Guayeteo
Think about it and feel it, my beautiful
Beat me for me and I haven't even done it

If you are going to talk to me, talk to me with respect
After I block you, the Bellaqueo begins
The boss tell me or say delicious doll
Sometimes they tell me crazy, sometimes I tell you that I don't need you
But you know that I love you for me
If you love me, accelerate, daddy
But I never needed you, you needed me

[Verse 4: Jowell & Kali Uchis]
(Okay, Okay, here, Okay)
I want to try with you a couple of technique '
Stretch as if it were 'elastic (UH)
Record as if you were 'pornographic
And turn as a geometric figure (UH)
Baby, put your hand on the wall, huh
To release how it is, huh
What beautiful class I have with you
Daddy, I repeat it to you

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Jowell]
Think about it if you want to burn
Stop it and be warm (Jowell)
Sit it that I get bad
Stop it, delay it (randy crazy note)
Think about it if you want to burn
Stop it and go warm
Sit it that I get bad
Stop it, delay it (Kali Uchis) 8embed
