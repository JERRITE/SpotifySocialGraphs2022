Fair-Weather Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
He could buy you a bed
It won't help you sleep
He could give you a watch
Not his time to keep
He could fly you to Verona or a mountain in the snow
But he won't know the places that we used to go

[Verse 2]
I heard he's best friends with Hollywood now
And he can afford all the champagne in town
I heard he's got a big house up on easy street
But I've got a big heart that I want you to keep
[Chorus]
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry

[Verse 3]
Don’t you remember
The promise we made
As our shadows grew long
In the field where we lay
That you’d always be you
And I’d always be me
As the sun fell asleep
And so did we

[Chorus]
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry

[Outro]
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll never love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
I know it won't make you cryYou might also like7Embed
