Just the one - remastered version LyricsDo you fancy a drink, just the one
To clear your head, we won't be long
It's a beautiful day to waste away
There's plenty of time for another one
You know you shouldn't do it
But see no reason why
So you blow your mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-ha
Make mine a short, getting there
But where there is, I couldn't care
There must be something I haven't tried
Perhaps that bottle before my eyes
You know you shouldn't do it
But you see no reason why
So you blow your mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-ha
I feel the haze, the sun goes down
It's getting late, let's hit the town
Call some friends to paint it red
Feed the animal, in your head
You know you shouldn't do it
But you see no reason why
So you blow your mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-ha
They throw you out, you hit the night
You go to a club, you feel alright
You get a pill, you take just half
Then take the rest of it for a laugh
You know you shouldn't do it
But you see no reason why
So you blow your mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-ha
The rest is blank and that's the worst
An empty head for an empty purse
You had a laugh, so you think
But in the morning you just stink
You know you shouldn't do it
But you see no reason why
So you blow your mind
Yeah, yeah, uh-ha
So you fancy a drink, just the one
To clear your head, we won't be longYou might also likeEmbed
