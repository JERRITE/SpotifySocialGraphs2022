I confess [live from the Sports Palace] Lyricsme I was the saddest day in the world
And I had to discover how to live
Without you every second

I went to walk in the cold
Sometimes to learn how to fly
You have to jump into a vacuum

And I learned so much from what I want to be
And there was no day when I didn't think about you
Never stop looking for how to come back
And I have finally achieved it
I'm with you again
And I understand what is the course
Smiled and I can believe it can be
Because you and I are together

And now that we are here
It has become so clear
I confess that being far I learned
That I want to be by your side

I returned the best day of my life
It was not difficult because I know that you always leave a light on
I came back and were waiting
Take your hand and said gently, because it took so long

And I learned so much from what I want to be
And there was no day when I didn't think about you
Never stop looking for how to come back
And I have finally achieved it

I'm with you again
And I understand what is the course
Smiled and I can believe it can be
Because you and I are together

And now that we are here
It has become so clear
I confess that being far I learned
That I want to be by your side
You might also like you with you again
And I understand what is the course
Smiled and I can believe it can be
Because you and I are together

And now that we are here
It has become so clear
I confess that being far I learned
What do I want to be by your side
