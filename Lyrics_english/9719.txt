Don’t Even Know It (U.O.E.N.O Parody) Lyrics[Intro]
Future!!! Uggh!!! Boss! Turn up! You didn't even know it. It seem like a lot of yall got me fucked up
When i pulled up to the fast food, yall be lookin scared - like i'm finna eat your food or something
Yall ready got me miscontrued. so im bout to clear some shit up- you didn't even know it
[Chorus]
I just lost 10 pounds you didn't even know it- you didn't even know it
Keep food under my titles- you didn't even know it
Got high cholesterol- you didn't even know it
Just lost my deal with reebook- you didn't even know it
I just ate yo lunch- you didn't even know it
I love captain crunch- you didn't even know it
I might rape yo girl- you didn't even know it
Might get a jerri curl- you didn't even know it
[Rick Ross Verse 1]
Is that a healthy snack?
Throw dat shit in the back
I want fried food, sweet snacks in my mayback
Throw dat shit in the back!
I want fried food, sweet sancks in  my mayback
When my fridge looking scarce
My apetite is fierce
One times I got so hungry
I even ate my beard
And yo girl she coming wit me
Cuz we both got nice titties
We both went on a shopping spree
At Victoria secret
No she know my braw size
Throw some D's on it
No she know my braw size
Throw some D's on it
Now pass me dem fries
Wit some cheese on it
And fuck a tomato
And fuck a tomato
My toothpaste is Mayo
Im shaped like a Halo
I'm shaped like a Halo
I never dance like a fabyo
But my whip do lean wit it - when im in da ride
And if a nigga touch my food- He commiting suicide
[Chorus]
