THATS MY BABY Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where?
I got you too
You scared
I'm down with you
Be right there
And I been here through
The nights and days
Licking these wounds
You know the place
I'll miss you on the way
Love me so good, girl, I’ll stay
You know what I mean and if you do
I'll stay right here next
[Chorus]
Nobody looks sexier than you, girl love the way that you do
You look so good, I would never get tired of you
I love it when you ride on top, you wanna say my name
You do it best baby, you know that you been my fave

[Verse 2]
She throwin’ that ass, I’m catchin’ that shit
She throwin’ that back, I'm making that hit
She know that I'm working, I'm working all week
She working, she working, she working ‘til three
Got booty she throwin’, she throw in my face
Pussy so good, I'll never disgrace
Pussy so good, I’ll fly outta state
Ta-take a damn flight you ridin’ at eight
Pussy popping at eight, I'll be breakin’ that bed
Pull it right back, lemme hop on them hips
When I'm pullin' up
Come give me hug
I ain't got a bed, so we fucking on a rug
I ain't got a rug, so we fucking on the wood
She ain't got a man 'cause a nigga couldn't do it
Told her it was big, I don't think she understood
I'ma love you right like a real man should

[Chorus]
Nobody looks sexier than you, girl love the way that you do
You look so good, I would never get tired of you
I love it when you ride on top, you wanna say my name
You do it best baby, you know that you been my fave
Nobody looks sexier than you, girl love the way that you do
You look so good, I would never get tired of you
I love it when you ride on top, you wanna say my name
You do it best baby, you know that you been my fave
