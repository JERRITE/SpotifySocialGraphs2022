Runninâ€™ Wild Lyrics[Intro]
Oh shit
Yeah, it's been a long time coming man
I've been swimming in this booze for way to long
Trynna give some water wings
Fuck it, engineer
Hahahaha

[Verse 1]
I'm not a role model
I barely get drunk off the whole bottle
Don't have a break, I'm going full throttle
I can't control it I just get rowdy
It's like there's a monster inside of me that can't get out me
All of my friend are having kids and they out working
I'm getting pissed in foreign countries and crowd surfing
You say I got a bright future, it don't sound certain
We play the loud version even if the crowd's hurting
I think that I've come to terms with the possibility
That I'll never have a day job or responsibility
In the rain splashing through some puddles in the Benz
Off the bubble hash, getting in some trouble with my friends
They couldn't hear me so I learned to shout
I'm turning up all the way where most these other crackers burning out
Yo I'm the kid that you heard about through word to mouth
Pull the burner out it's something to be concerned about, cause
[Chorus]
Cause one of these days I'm gonna get my shit together, get my feet back on the ground
I'm gonna be good, gonna find a quiet place to recover somewhere and settle down
One of these days I'm gonna be gone and you're gonna miss having me around
Till then I'll just keep running wild

[Verse 2]
Yo, lets get back to the topic at hand
My life's a beach and my balls got a tropical tan
With my girl dancing naked with a top in the sand
Five years ago this seemed like an impossible plan
I'm in this shit deep with no intention to stop
I break laws every day, don't pay attention to cops
When it comes to bad habits I got a plethora
Trynna keep up with me the shit will be the death of ya
I'm a creature of the night
Every feature that I write
Make your head hurt like I just came to beat you with a pipe
Don't care about tomorrow cause I'm living for today
I've got a buffet of problems and I'm giving them away
Man I got to make a change this shit is way past due
When it comes to booze I'm in a different weight class dude
Moderation's just something that my brain can't do
This whole hotel room looking like a train came through
Fuck it..
You might also like[Chorus]
Cause one of these days I'm gonna get my shit together, get my feet back on the ground
I'm gonna be good, gonna find a quiet place to recover somewhere and settle down
One of these days I'm gonna be gone and you're gonna miss having me around
Till then I'll just keep running wild
(one more time)
Cause one of these days I'm gonna get my shit together, get my feet back on the ground
I'm gonna be good, gonna find a quiet place to recover somewhere and settle down
One of these days I'm gonna be gone and you're gonna miss having me around
Till then I'll just keep running wild

[Outro]
Hahahahaha
Yeah, shit
Damn
HahahahaEmbed
