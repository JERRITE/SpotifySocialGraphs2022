There are no law Lyrics [letter of "there is no law" ft. C.R.O & neo pistéa]

[Verse 1: neo pistéa]
Vi-vi-virulana (ah), burned spoons (UF)
Cooked drugs, crack like the track short of all in slices (slices)
It always advances' (se), I always saw my face (always)
That I had it clear (se), I always saw my face (huh)
Ey, ey, ole
Here I handle the rag, I am the Sole (I am the Sole)
From Guachin selling at school (school)
Sneakers, drugs, celus or watches
Mommy, if White Migos (EH) arrives, they scare to 'your friend' (h)
Capuchas and glasses, Beto Cadenas, two more serves you sports (h)
Drink, if you dance 'with me (with me), you will have to go down to the floor (floor)
They lack the street, they lack stew, they are like Flanders, they cut their musta '
It doesn't give, I don't have to do anything more '(nothing ma)
I never lied (lied), I always said the same (same)
I never changed (I changed), I always told the same (same)
And it does not give (ah), it does not give (ah), your life and 'lie, I do not know what you tell (you have)
If mom pays you what you buy (purchases)
If that car is not yours, that's dad
[Chorus: C.R.O, neo pistéa & both]
Here there is no law, I do it, he falls asleep, I giving him play
Bye, bye, bae, the whore bores me, best play play
The king returns
I wake up always sweating at 6
I wake up always sweating at 6 (ey, ey)
I wake up always sweating at 6 (ey, ey)
Here there is no law, ah, I do it, he falls asleep, I giving him play (play)
Bye, Bye, Bae, Ey, the whore bores me, best play play
The king returns, ah
I wake up always sweating at 6
I wake up always sweating at 6
I wake up always sweating at 6, ey (always at 6)

[Verse 2: STB Supreme, C.R.O]
Cocaine Castle Mama
You fall asleep to the face
White Devil, "Equinsu Ocha" Black
Makes the dog rebel
Black mambo without oxygen
Dark shit of the Boy trap
Superstar, racing it from two
Breathe drugs, it's a player
We are kings of the lip
Organized Band, Mafia
If you are good you will never talk
Never toad, daddy, be real
Pace for laziness
A lot of smoke in abundance
Supreme only progresses
That take care of you like a panda
That my ñeros are all murderer ', trained dogs' are not in danger
Better do not cross the Leale '
Because there, Papuco, everything is worth
Gangsta og, gangsta og (wow, oh)

I'm changing the matrix, ah
Nose transit, UH
Estamo 'drugs the country, uh
Now your actress calls me
Puta, come give me a kiss, I wake up, I see gray, I'm taking with your actress
Without paying, without thinking, unhappy, I see blood in your nose, drug with the triple F
Estamo 'sounding fat, ha
I'm smoking a fat
Your life and a lie, ha
They will touch the background, ha
Call those label ', ha
They want to collaborate 'that' dog ', ha
Only birra in the refrigerator, ha
Barrio boy, unhappy
What tells me? What tells me? What do you see? I lose faith, there are no coffee, sounds of bitch
They wanted to punish me and I did not leave them, I was one against three, fags of bitch
What tells me? What tells me? What do you see? I lose faith, there are no coffee, sounds of bitch
They wanted to punish me and I did not leave them, I was one against three, fags of dog

[Chorus: C.R.O, neo pistéa & both]
Here there is no law, I do it, he falls asleep, I giving him play

I wake up always sweating at 6 (ey, ey)
I wake up always sweating at 6 (ey, ey)
Here there is no law, ah, I do it, he falls asleep, I giving him play (play)
Bye, Bye, Bae, Ey, the whore bores me, best play play
The king returns, ah
