Back To Miami Lyrics[Intro: P3k On 1Thou]
Go Blah
Swerve the coupe on Biscayne (Biscayne)
Let the chopper bang, bang (Bang, bang)
Swerve the coupe on Biscayne (Biscayne)
Let the chopper bang, bang (Bang, bang)

[Chorus: P3k On 1Thou]
I ain't going, going, going (Where?)
I ain't going, going, going back to Miami (Okay)
To Miami (Ooh-ooh)
I ain't going, going, going (Where?)
I ain't going, going, going back to Miami
To Miami (Turn up)

Swerve the coupe on Biscayne (Biscayne, skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)

[Verse 1: P3k On 1Thou]
Uh, ocean drivin' the new coupe, roof chopped off
Drink with the fruit mix with smurn off
Richard Millie on the wrist, everything paid off
No, not gone, we flossin' (Yeah)
Cars to be the bossin' (I'm a boss)
You run up on me wrong, take caution
We cock back, squeeze, we off him (Lay 'em down)
Prrt, prrt, prrt, in the coffin (Yeah)
Mommy walk by in the new Loub' boots
3k for tints, five more for the tuck, took fat from my stomach and then she put it in her butt (Yeah-yeah)
She so bad, but she used to be a mutt, now she all glammed up
In the new Benz truck
Like, "Daddy wassup" little momma wanna fuck, so get me birthed up

[Chorus: P3k On 1Thou]
I ain't going, going, going (Where?)
I ain't going, going, going back to Miami (Okay)
To Miami (Ooh-ooh)
I ain't going, going, going (Where?)
I ain't going, going, going back to Miami
To Miami (Turn up)

We in Miami, I know you got friends (Yeah, I know you got friends), body and fountain blue, we bring 'em in
We ran it up and we did it again, now we litty again (Oh)
After I hit, let my brothers get in, ain't talkin' money, I can't comprehend (Oh)

All of these racks that I spend, pull up with Benz, take her and her friend (Skrrt, skrrt)

Ain't makin' no plans, whatever I got had to go take a chance (Go take a chance, it's Mook)

[Chorus: P3k On 1Thou]

To Miami (Turn up)
