Cruel Lyrics Ángel [Lyrics of "Ángel Cruel"]

[Verse 1]
With that face so sweet that you carry
And that look that does not let
Side hairstyle, it serves as a hook
Ideal alibi for hiding

[Pre-car]
And without knowing, I found
Something in you that hallucinates me
You, Cruel Angel
Of your skin an addict without exit
[Chorus]
It is you who opens my wounds
It's you who pollutes me
You, the reason
You, my medicine
In your arms I lose my senses
There is no control of what I feel and say
Today, it is your voice that dominates me

[Verse 2]
It is your way of being the one that has me
Agonizing because I want more
More of your body, your sweet poison
And I don't plan to let out

[Pre-car]
And without knowing, I found
Something in you that hallucinates me
You, Cruel Angel
Of your skin an addict without exit

[Chorus]
It is you who opens my wounds
It's you who pollutes me
You, the reason
You, my medicine
In your arms I lose my senses
There is no control of what I feel and say
Today, it is your voice that dominates me
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
Those eyes that kill inside
And that appear in all my dreams
Like an angel, you get to my life
Your cruel medicine is your lips

[Chorus]
It is you who opens my wounds
It's you who pollutes me
You, the reason
You, my medicine
In your arms I lose my senses
There is no control of what I feel and say
Today is your voice (the reason) that dominates me (my medicine)
Today is your voice that dominates me
