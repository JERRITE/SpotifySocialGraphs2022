Easy to Love Lyrics[Intro]
(Pay-Pay-PayHouse)
(SephGotTheWaves)
(Almari)

[Chorus]
Went from stolen cars to Aventadors
I shot dice on stage, at the B.E.T Awards
Eyes in my rear view, even though I’m going forward
I’m not a landlord, but I been had open doors
This bust down Rolex, this not no Michael Kors
I wished you found me when I was at my lowest
It feel so easy to love me, when I'm drowning in money, when I’m drowning in diamonds
[Verse]
Need you to please tell me, do you first-night every nigga you meet?
You better tell me that it was just me
Got niggas in stockades who was just free
They beds been made, it wasn't by Jeffrey, no, no, no
That’s for my young niggas in and out the court like Derozan
I left some niggas but I turned around for 'em like an outburst
I know some niggas who I thought was gangster, name on paperwork
Seen so many pretty hoes get nasty when they take a Perc
Fuck a white a ho, when around me, can’t say N-word
Free Lil Ken, he got three strikes like the pitch curved (The pitch curved)

[Chorus]
Went from stolen cars to Aventadors
I shot dice on stage, at the B.E.T Awards
Eyes in my rear view, even though I’m going forward
I’m not a landlord, but I been had open doors
This bust down Rolex, this not no Michael Kors
I wished you found me when I was at my lowest
It feel so easy to love me, when I'm drowning in money, when I’m drowning in diamondsYou might also likeEmbed
