Happy Place (feat. Jasmine Thompson) Lyrics[Chorus: Stevie Jukes]
Over the hills and far away
Looking out for a better day
When it seems like there's no escape
Take me to my happy place

[Verse 1: Stevie Jukes]
If I could wish upon a star
I'd wish that I could heal the scars
And take away every ounce of pain
So hold my hand if it feel scared
I'll build a house where you feel safe
And if you call my name, then I'll be there
[Chorus: Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson, Jasmine Thompson]
Over the hills and far away
Looking out for a better day
When it seems like there's no escape (There's no escape)
Take me to my happy place

[Verse 2: Jasmine Thompson, Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson]
If I could wish upon a star
I'd take us right back to the start
Close my eyes and live those days again
Oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To hear you laugh and see you smile
I wish that things would never have to change

[Chorus: Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson]
Over the hills and far away
Looking out for a better day
When it seems like there's no escape
Take me to my happy place

[Bridge:  Stevie Jukes, Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson]
In the darkness, leave a light on
Through the storm, I'll remember what you told us
"Keep your head up, standing strong
If you dream and believe, you can find a way back home"
You might also like[Chorus: Stevie Jukes, Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson, Jasmine Thompson]
Over the hills and far away
Looking out for a better day
When it seems like there's no escape
Take me to my happy place
Over the hills and far away
Looking out for a better day
When it seems like there's no escape (There's no escape)
Take me to my happy place

[Outro: Stevie Jukes & Jasmine Thompson, Jasmine Thompson]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh yeah)
Take me to my happy place
Take me to my happy placeEmbed
