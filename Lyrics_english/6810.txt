Caution and Ease Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah Papi
Papi

[Hook]
Yeah
Caution and ease
They tryna tell you that they loyal
Don't you believe
When they tell you that they loyal
Don't just listen with your ears, try to listen with your eyes too
Don't just listen with your ears, try to listen with your eyes too
[Verse]
Damn, think ya never talk to the man
Can't listen to a nigga like I don't understand
Like how I'm suppose to follow if you don't got a plan
A nigga try to testify to me that I been different
Acting like I lost all my commitment
But really you the ones who really tripping
When's the last time you checked on me like, "How you been?"
I barely get any rest
I feel the pain in my chest
I tried to give you the best
You left my head in a mess
Used to stare at you with love
Now all I feel is regret
I put your love to the test
In return I got an F

[Hook]
Caution and ease
They tryna show you that they loyal
Don't you believe
When they tell you that they loyal
Don't just listen with your ears, try to listen with your eyes too
Don't just listen with your ears, try to listen with your eyes tooYou might also likeEmbed
