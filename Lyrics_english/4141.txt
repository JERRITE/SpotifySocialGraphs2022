[Intro: Duki]
(I took her out of the park with a homerun
—Cabrón, being me is bastard)

[Chorus: duki]
If you want to border on, I have a lot
I have a lot, I have a lot sticks
I took her out of the park with a homerun
Being me is bastard, being me is bastard

I took her out of the park with a homerun
Being me is bastard, being me is bastard

But know no, they don't have my flow
I get off the show, mommy, in my note
Mind of champion, winning horse
I no longer know what e 'the Dеrrota
The car 'are expensive', the violet bow
A BACANO FLOW OF ANOTHER PLANET
I run at Beat, but I'm not athlete
An HP with all 'the lyrics'
On the street they say that I am the force
Even if there is pressure, impossible to tweet
I get alone, Duko does not strive
So tira'o pa'trá 'that seems reverse

[Pre-stribe: duki]
And they are offended if they see the album sells
Hopefully and without an elf, smoking a couple of green '(eh-eh)
Like a rocket, mount in a corvette
If you cross me ', run, as Duko don't put him

Krippy I have a lot, I have a lot
Everyone knows that Somo 'del Callejón
What a mascara ', the pistol, Well, Well, took you out'
Asses I have a lot
Krippy I have a lot, I have a lot
Everyone knows that Somo 'del Callejón
What a mascara ', the pistol, Well, Well, took you out'
