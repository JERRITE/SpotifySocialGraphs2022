Woo, woo, yeahh (rruh)

I need (wouh) from the whole break, yes (ey)
It sparkles (yes), but my heart is dark, yes (diamond)
The Roli (wouh) is still full of clunkers, yes (iced-out)
It's a party in the whole city (city)
Everyone is today and forever awake (awake)
A bottle of schnapps and the Diddy pop (pop)
Pop, pop, lock it, baby, come and dance (pop and drop it)

[Pre-Hook]
And we dance through the night, through the night (wouh)
Lights in the city (pop, lock and drop it), yes
We shoot donuts in a parking lot (wouh)
Ljubav is the power (Jajajaja)

The Town (Die Town), Lights Out (Lights Out)
Let bau'n (let bau'n), in my house (mei'm house)
All on it (all on), all down (ey, yeah)
All ghosts come at midnight (it's night)
Everyone drinks, no sinners there (wouh)
All caps like the attack (tuk, tuk)
Five thousand euro shoes everywhere (so expensive)
You might so like [pre-hook]

Lights in the city (pop, lock and drop it), yes
We shoot donuts in a parking lot (wouh)
Ljubav is the power (Jajajaja)
