Voodoo Lyrics ["Voodoo" letter]]

[Intro: Lunay & Chencho Corleone, both]
(Eh eh)
(The Martian ', OH-OH)
You make me little and I like danger
The thing about us went further (ah-ah)
You ere 'the apple in the forbidden tree (oh, oh)
You get my evil to walk
As much as I try, I could not separate myself
With you, the others stand
You like to control myself and leave me 'wanting more'
[Choir: Congo Corleone]
I don't know what you did to me
I don't know what you planned
You took advantage of my weakness
With the drinks you cheat me
I don't know what you did to me
I don't know what you planned
You took advantage of my weakness
With your fantasy you tangled me

[Post-Coro: Concho Corleone & Lunay]
Chick
They are 'crazy' that you provoke and get bad
This is not normal (normal)
Oh, baby
They are 'crazy' that you provoke and get bad
This is not normal (this is not normal; the child)

[Verse 1: Lunay]
You made me a voodoo; Like Camilo, "You, You" (Oh)
I get 'in To' La'o, as an ad on YouTube (EY)
When I am `` Esnús give him more 'that in Kung fu (Wuh)
That is why I have not 'forget me and also knows' that
The thing that I do 'are a taboo
We stayed 'on the skin like a tattoo
If they ask me for you, I tell them: "I don't know"
Because nobody has to know, hey
Because the thing I do 'are a taboo
We stayed 'on the skin like a tattoo
24/7 control 'my mind
More connects than a ray with bluetooth (the Martian ', oh)

[Verse 2: Concho Corleone]
I dream and get 'you, awake and come back' you
Trust me, Raitrú, if you made me a voodoo
For the magnitude of this desire to fullness
For every thing you did to me you told that attitude
I have a 'insatiable' wins to squeeze your health
Lower the beauty until we give us a Patatu
Ask what he wants', take his hand
Pa 'do' sing 'you and I in a suite in tulum
I like to see you live to do what I write
Since you write to me 'I'm already imagining it
Addictive, the sound of your squeaky
MAI, we share without being exclusive
[Outro: Lunay & Chencho Corleone]
(I don't know what you did to me
I don't know what you planned
You took advantage of my weakness
With your fantasy you tangled me)
