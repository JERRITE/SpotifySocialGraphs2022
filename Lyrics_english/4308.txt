TranslationEnglishcarmín Lyrics ["Carmín" ft letter. Juan Luis Guerra]

[Intro]
This love
He dazzles, takes breath
Fascinating is feeling
That she is made for me

[Verse 1: Juan Luis Guerra]
I sink into very deep fantasies
I paint a rainbow and a garden
In a flower circus
I flood me with emotions
And stain my carmine cheek
[Verse 2: Romeo Santos]
It has become my muse
Fourth diminishing me
With a drawing 'e da vinci
Brutal, incredible
Strong inspiration

[Choir: Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra]
High seas cross in a dolphin
For her swim until the end
In a sleepless yola

[Pre-verso: Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra]
This love
Impresses you in its splendor
As Van Gogh's work
Watercolor to perfection

[Verse 1: Juan Luis Guerra]
I sink into very deep fantasies
I paint a rainbow and a garden
In a flower circus
I flood me with emotions
And stain my carmine cheek

[Verse 2: Romeo Santos]
It has become my muse
Fourth diminishing me
With a drawing 'e da vinci
Brutal, incredible
Strong inspiration

[Bridge: Romeo Santos]
Listen to the words of two poets

[Choir: Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra]
High seas cross in a dolphin
For her swim until the end
In a sleepless yola

My heart is naked
She is music, sighs
Harmony in my song

[Outro: Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, both]
This love
It dazzles takes breath
Fascinating is feeling
That she is made for membed
