Next to dawn Lyrics [letter from "next to dawn"]

[Intro]
And Niki-Guay-Guay-Guay
NANANANA-NANA, NANAU-NANAU

[Pre-car]
If we are given the opportunity
That our bodies can be found
I made sure to bring you to a place
Where you and I have a good time
If we are given the opportunity
That our bodies can be found
I made sure to bring you to a place
Where you and I have a good time (uoh-oh)
[Chorus]
And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife (OH-OH)
And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife

[Verse 1]
I will be your coat, your consultation, your wolf
Today you will be my baby and I who kisses them 'steals you
I want dawn with you touching you to'a
While 'we enjoy the movement of the waves
Everything natural without anyone seeing us
If the cell sounds to you and it is your jevo, Le Pichea '
If you want 'drink turns on, you ask for whatever
That here I am and I know that you want me

[Saying]
If you don't believe in love, just like me
I can then do it in your own way
If you don't believe in love, just like me
To'a the night will be passenger
If you don't believe in love, just like me
Then I will do it in your way
If you don't believe in love, just like me
To'a the night will be passenger

And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife (OH-OH)
And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife

[Verse 2]
I want to make you a woman playing to be unfaithful
I know that you practice that role well
Vamo 'to take advantage of the situation
Regregating your imagination
'We are both sunny' and there is no turning back
What happens here, here will stay
Without any bonding, nobody is going to tie
'We are both sunny' and there is no turning back
What happens here, here will stay
Without any bonding, nobody is going to tie

[Pre-car]
If we are given the opportunity
That our bodies can be found
I made sure to bring you to a place
Where you and I have a good time
[Saying]
If you don't believe in love, just like me
I can then do it in your own way
If you don't believe in love, just like me
To'a the night will be passenger
If you don't believe in love, just like me
Then I will do it in your way
If you don't believe in love, just like me
To'a the night will be passenger

[Chorus]
And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife (OH-OH, Yeah)
And see the sun rising next to dawn
While 'the breeze strokes your hair
I will make you my wife

[Outro]
I will make you my wife, I will make you my wife, I will make you my wife
I will make you my wife, I will make you my wife, I will make you my wife
