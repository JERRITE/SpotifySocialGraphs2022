Whoop Whoop Lyricssongtekst from Glades - "Whoop Whoop" ft. Ismo & Riffi

[Intro: Glades]
Smoothes, smoothes, smoothes
Mr. Para for that paper

[Fresh 1: Riffi]
They don't understand EWA then I make the connection
Come to my show calories that you burn
Put your best leg forward even though it gets out of hand
They don't fall for you but they are falling through the basket
Show them what we feel they don't know what we mean
I have goals so I don't let them sit on those seats
Come with fiery things I don't have time to cool off
I don't have time to waste I don't have time to cuddle
Because I'm on it, they can't stand me
And if I wasn't on then you wouldn't be off
Not only my lights but your wife lets me go
I'm not going for those chikies so I have to go for the loot
I want some meters they scale but no I don't need drinks
I don't care if you pay if you are green or white
So do your things that pokoe through the Hoodeplank
Ibahasj who doesn't take me when I'm on my wary
[Hook: Riffi]
Whoop, Whoop, That's the Sound of the Police
Whoop, Whoop, they want me la carte grise
Whoop, Whoop, Ewa disappear from nowhere roof blown off Make a broken question to the beats
Whoop, Whoop, This is the Sound of the Police
Whoop, Whoop, they want me la carte grise
Whoop, Whoop, Ewa disappear from nowhere roof blown off Make a broken question to the beats
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
In the Waggie or in the Limousina
In your Osso or in the middle of a villa
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
In the Waggie or in the Limousina
In your Osso or in the middle of a villa
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina

[Fresh 2: Ismo]
Eey, eey, when I talk you have to be quiet
I want a lot of money you want a lot of shine
I can miss all that shine just like toothache
A billionaire cannot be happy without souls
Ewa puts Rwina I see no one but they see me
I hear them talking about Gannoes Ewa shoots me
All multi -millionaires that are not happy
Those little boys who are happy when they are seen
I count my money and right then I grab my way again
Now I want to know what you are doing it doesn't care what you say
They looked skewed but I put all those crooked looks
Doekoe heals those open wounds so I am attached to it

(Whoop, Whoop)
This is the sound of the police
(Whoop Whoop)
They want me la carte grise
(Whoop, Whoop)
Ewa disappear from nowhere roof blown off. Duty broken question from the beats
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
In the Waggie or in the Limousina
In your Osso or in the middle of a villa
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
In the Waggie or in the Limousina
In your Osso or in the middle of a villa
Set Rwina, put Rwina, put Rwina
