Down On Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
We are waking up in a pile of shit
The whole bay is full of it
And it keeps growing out of our ears
But we keep swimming in this wide oceans of salty tears

[Chorus]
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
[Verse 2]
Down the central of your sensual sense
Freak more freaks now while I got the chance
But keeps on cool, dogs, don’t waste it all
The day is soon to come when you gon' need it, y'all
I say—

[Chorus]
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

[Bridge]
Like leaves, the days are falling, not tell me why
The breeze carry for a while but it will fall to the ground
These days life is a callin’
Life not a waiting, life is running away
But long after you’re gone, your tears will still be answered
If you’re here now, you’ll be apart forever

[Chorus]
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonightYou might also like9Embed
