No NBA P2 (Interlude) Lyrics[Intro]
DP on the beat

[Verse: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Chief Sosa, baby, I been ballin' hard, no discounts
Diamonds look like piss now, bitch, I'm the shit now
Ballout, baby, I been flexin', ridin' Bentleys now
And my wrist so chilly now, all my bitches pretty now
Chief Sosa, baby, I been goin' hard, ayy
Chief Sosa, baby, I been ridin' foreign cars, ayy
Ballout, baby, I'm rollin' so damn hard
I be geeked up off them pills and them Xanny bars
Chief Sosa, baby, I been ballin' hard, no discounts
Diamonds look like piss now, bitch, I'm the shit now
Ballout, baby, I been flexin', ridin' Bentleys now
And my wrist so chilly now, all my bitches pretty now
Chief Sosa, baby, I been goin' hard, ayy
Chief Sosa, baby, I been ridin' foreign cars, ayy
Ballout, baby, I'm rollin' so damn hard
I be geeked up off them pills and them Xanny bars
[Outro]
