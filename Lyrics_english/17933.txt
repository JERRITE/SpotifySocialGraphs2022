Flight to Paris Lyrics [intro] 
 At midnight you're leaving and you make me suffer 
 Since that time I have not wanted to stop from here 
 This situation is already normal 
 There may be no solution 
 I don't know why we fight, there is no winner 
 I run to your house and everything is empty 

 [Chorus] 
 He left on a flight to Paris 
 You will find a new love 
 The last flight to Paris 
 [Post-chorus] 
 He left me alone 
 He left me alone 

 [See 2] 
 I continue and keep calling obsessed 
 Eiffel tower arrives my crying 
 "C'est la Vie," they say so 
 Calm is, and I will sleep 
 I don't know why we fight to God 
 I run to your house and everything is empty 

 [Chorus] 
 He left on a flight to Paris 
 You will find a new love 
 It is the last flight to Paris 

 [Bridge] 
 Broken his heart took him in his suitcase 
 I hope to wake up and find you returned 
 I shouldn't let you out of that door 

 [Outro] 
 He left me alone 
 I'm going on a flight to Paris 
 Because I go crazy 
 The first flight to Paris 
 Love returns, love 
 LOVE RETURNS, AMORYOU MIGHT ALSO Like1embed
