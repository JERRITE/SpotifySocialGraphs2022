Just the Way Iâ€™m Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love in, love out
Find the feeling
Scream in, scream out
Time for healing
You feel the moment's gone too soon
You're watching clouds come over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Torn in two
You close your eyes for some place new
Torn in two
[Chorus]
And I feel it's going down
Ten feet below the ground
I'm waiting for your healing hand
One touch could bring me round
I feel it's going down
Ten feet below the ground
It's just the way I'm feeling

[Verse 2]
Glow in, burn out
Lost the feeling
Bruise in, you bruise out
Nurse the bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
Torn in two
Each time we bruise

[Chorus]
And I feel it's going down
Ten feet below the ground
I'm waiting for your healing hand
One touch could bring me round
I feel we're going down
Ten feet below the ground
It's just the way I'm feeling
Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling

Two different views
As words confuse and break
I can't get out
There's no way out of here
I can't get clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Love in, love out
Find the feeling

[Chorus]
And I feel it's going down
Ten feet below the ground
I'm waiting for your healing hand
One touch could bring me round
I feel we're going down
Ten feet below the ground
It's just the way I'm feeling
Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling
Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling
Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feeling
Yeah yeah, it's just the way I'm feelingEmbed
