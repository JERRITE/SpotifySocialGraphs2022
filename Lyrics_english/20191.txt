Hell No Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should've known better
I saw her wearing your sweater
Nice glasses, fake red hair, just like me
Stop crying, stop crawling
Can't you see that I have stopped falling
We were good at faking forever
I get it, whatever
Am I gonna miss you?

[Chorus]
Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
Mama said that the boys like you never work out any way
(Boys like you)
My girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him back?" I say
Hell no, oh, hell no
I get it, whatever
[Verse 2]
Straight up, don't blame you
You’re not the Cash and I’m not the June
Never be the one to make you better
Whatever

[Chorus]
Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
Mama said that the boys like you never work out any way
(Boys like you)
My girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him back?" I say
Hell no, oh, hell no

[Bridge]
In my bed late at night
Thinking of how you held me tight
Will I be lonely when I wake?
Did we make a big mistake?

[Chorus]
Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
I always knew that a boy like you wouldn't work out any way
"You gonna take him back?"
Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
Mama said that the boys like you never work any way
(Boys like you)
My girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him back?" I say
Hell no, oh, hell no

I get it
Hell no
(I'm not gonna miss you)
Oh hell no
Whatever
Hell no
You gonna take him back?
