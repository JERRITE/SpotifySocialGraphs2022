Weekend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Freak out, don’t freak out
Don’t freak out right now
Your heart was broken, you’re waking up now
You were in love like never before
Warm like a gun, now you’re goin’ to war
Shooting at stars won’t take your pain away
Sentimental waves will make you feel astray
Now you’re trynna run away yeah
You’re trynna get away
You wanna get away
What you’re trynna runaway from
[Chorus]
If we could live forever for a weekend
Throw a party and dive off the deep end
Would you party all night no sleepin’?
Have the time of our life with no regrets
We could live forever on the weekend
Throw a party see me diving off the deep end
This feeling got me thinking
Over thinking, I would do it again

[Verse 2]
We been divin’ off the deep end lately
We could chill on the weekend maybe
We ain’t never really cared what they got to say
If we’re ever feelin’ lost we’ll find a way
Cause we’ve been down and out before
Waitin’ out the storm
Make the great escape right now
Don’t wait it out
Feel your heart pumpin’, let’s do it now
Gotta balance out, feel yourself like ridin’ a wave
What goes around comes around will lead you astray
Can you feel the temperatures been risin’
Took a little heat, you’re realizing
That you got your life, it’s on the line
Its a high stake game, we’ll roll the dice
Do what it takes, we’ll pay the price
Cos as long as youre living
Horizons stays vivid because
You might also like[Chorus]
If we could live forever for a weekend
Throw a party and dive off the deep end
Would you party all night no sleepin’?
Have the time of our life with no regrets
We could live forever on the weekend
Throw a party see me diving off the deep end
This feeling got me thinking
Over thinking, I would do it again

[Verse 3]
Feel like the suga suga suga honey iced tea
Today’s my present so I leave my past behind me
Shining bright, we’re feeling like some high beams
I only like the week with e-n-d behind it
And you can catch me diving head first in the deep end
Got my brothers here with me and no ones sinking down the boat
Every day is like the weekend
Yeah my troubles stay behind me, moving forward that’s all she wrote
Take off like chitty chitty bang bang
Jumping off the main stage
Ain’t trippin off of going home, I’m out until the sun fades
Flying down the highway, run through it like a freight train
Don’t ever wanna slow it down because I know it’s Friday
Got all my blessings on this road
It’s the love you bring that makes me feel at home
I know, I know
That it’s time for new beginnings I got the strongest feeling that...
[Chorus]
If we could live forever for a weekend
Throw a party and dive off the deep end
Would you party all night no sleepin’?
Have the time of our life with no regrets
We could live forever on the weekend
Throw a party see me diving off the deep end
This feeling got me thinking
Over thinking, I would do it again1Embed
