[Verse 1: Luísa Sonza]
Baby, it's every thing I do that you don't even know
I know I'm going to set fire to the track before night
[Refrain: Luísa Sonza]
I have a wild instinct
TE Marco made tattoo

[Pre-Statement: Luísa Sonza]
I pay the bill and we send
Shows me anconnda to La Nicki Minaj
When it is time, it just doesn't get emotional
Which is one more for account, it's just slutty

[Chorus: Luísa Sonza]
After you shovel, it's just bye, bye, bye
I call you a car and 'you go, go, go
After you shovel, it's just bye, bye, bye
I call you a car
After you shovel, it's just bye, bye, bye
I call you a car and 'you go, go, go
After you shovel, it's just bye, bye, bye
I call you a car and 'you go, go, go

In a minute it is vino (Ey!)
