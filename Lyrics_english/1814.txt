To Let a Good Thing Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can't ask a tree to blossom if it isn't spring
Don't leave the house at midnight and expect the birds to sing
If you're looking for a reason, you needn't even try
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die

[Verse 2]
You can't conjure up more money if you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days if you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water, but you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
[Verse 3]
You can't light a fire from nothing, or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart if it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 4]
You can't drum up the heartbeats of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever 'cause nothing ever lasts
If it's keeping you from sleeping, wipe the tear from your eye
'Cause sometimes, it's time to let a good thing dieYou might also like4Embed
