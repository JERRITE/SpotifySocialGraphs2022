Swimming in the Moonlight Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're outside
It's cold enough to see your breath
You don't mind undressing 'til there's nothin' left
I feel the fire, it's comforting
It lights you up
I see everything I need
Right here and

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're swimming in the moonlight, oh
[Chorus]
Here outside
It's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Though we're moving quickly
It feels I've waited all my life
Until this moment
I'd only dreamed of paradise
For hours without a single word
We hold on tight
If nothing's perfect
Then you and I are nothing tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're swimming in the moonlight, oh
Now we're swimming, swimming
In the moonlight, yeah

[Chorus]
Here outside
It's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight
Here outside
It's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight
You might also like[Bridge]
You have no clue how gorgeous you are
Thank God, oh
In a time when nothing's right
Still, there shines a light
You're my everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Here outside
It's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight, oh, yeah, yeah, ow!
Here outside
It's just you and I
I couldn't love you more (couldn't love you more)
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight

[Outro]
You have no clue how gorgeous you are
Thank God, oh
You're the moon, my blue lagoon
My favorite tune, my everything, everything, everything, oh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
