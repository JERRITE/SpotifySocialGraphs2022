Miss U Lyrics ["Miss U" letter]

[Chorus]
I miss you, I don't even know where you are
I miss you and I can't call you
I'M on my shit now, I'M Going to the top
I Miss You Baby, So I Wish You Coming Back

I GOT MY TOWN AND MY MONEY ON MY MIND
I GOT MY TOWN AND MY MONEY ON MY MIND
I lost you, I don't know where you are
I lost you, I don't know where you are going
[Verse 1]
I remember Baby when we were and I
Sorry baby because I can't treat you
I was lost mommy, I come from Mars
And I don't know, I don't know, I never knew how to love you
I'M on my shit now, I'M Going to the top
Now i Got Hoes and My Homies Have The Guap
Now, where are you?, Where's you by my side?
She was my baby now don't even I pick me up
I Don's Even Feel That My Heart Is Not Alone
I was a lot, I'm trying to forget you
All i know is that i'm going to the sky
And you are not here, but what do you do 'to do?

[Bridge]
Hey, what did he do 'to do?
If you are not by my side, what do you see 'to do?
If you are not by my side, what do you see 'to do?
If you are not by my side, what do you see 'to do?

[Verse 2]
I loved you, you left me
And I don't even know where going to look for you
And I'm broken
I already know how to throw little by little
Now is This, Now I'M Going to the Top
I Miss You Baby, and I Need You by My Side
Now is This, Now I'M Going to the Top
You Miss Me Baby, But You Are Never By My Side No More
No on My Side, no more
You are no longer here, hey
You are no longer here
I feel that I lost it
You are no longer here, my mother asks me
What happened to you and I don't blame me
That if you do something, how are you, that if you study something
That was not pa 'ti, keo, you'll find yours

I miss you, I don't even know where you are
I miss you and I can't call you
I'M on my shit now, I'M Going to the top
I Miss You Baby, So I Wish You Coming Back

I GOT MY TOWN AND MY MONEY ON MY TOWN
I GOT MY TOWN AND MY MONEY ON MY TOWN
I lost you, I don't know where you are
I lost you, I don't know where you are16embed
