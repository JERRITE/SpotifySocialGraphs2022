[Pre-car: Ozuna & Chencho Corleone]
I've been telling it for a while (oh, oh; oh)
That something better deserves (deserves)
Lost time continues
Knowing that it does not belong to me (it belongs)

But when the note goes up, he always returns to me
He tells me: "My life, I know what I have to leave what you do your follies" (eh-eh, eh-eh)
[Choir: Ozuna, J Balvin & Chencho Corleone]
You my madness, Baby (Baby)
The hours spend and most ask me for more (it asks me more)
Do not tired, it seems to have no end

You my madness, Baby (Baby)
The hours pass and more ask me for more (more)
Do not get tired, it seems to have no end (ah-ah-ah)
Ours is crazy

[Verse 1: ozuna]

Before 'arrive with the photo to torture me (I torture me)

You spend to'a the squeeze night 'with me (with me)
No one suspects because neither for the rede 'I follow (I follow her)

[Verse 2: Concho Corleone]
Whenever I listen to a song that reminds me of you
Or a daring photo that comes to me
I am activated by desire, I want you
And I call you because I know there is never a lock
You tell me that ours is Eternity
Because devouring us has turned your fatality
In five letters I am the one who penetrates you (-ra)
I corleone when it does it and 'High Quality
You put insanity because I'm your weakest
In privacy, the 'e' a reality
I do what I want with your life and I allowed it
But you call me 'or I call you and fall out there

[Verse 3: J Balvin]
Tell me what is your purpose
See your videos as Ester Expósito
You have me well crazy
I do not understand what the problem is
If we like it so much, what is the dilemma? (Tell me tell me)
I'm tempted to touch you, tempted to sin
For me I kidnap you and you don't go from here
But if he returns to me
He tells me: "My life, I know that I have to let you do your follies"
Tempted to touch you, tempted to sin
For me I kidnap you and you don't go from here
But if he returns to me
He tells me: "My life, I know that I have to let you do your follies"
[Choir: Ozuna, J Balvin & Chencho Corleone]
You my madness, Baby (Baby)
The hours spend and most ask me for more (it asks me more)
Do not tired, it seems to have no end
Ours is crazy (madness; oh-oh)
You my madness, Baby (Baby)
The hours pass and more ask me for more (more)
Do not tired, it seems to have no end
Ours is crazy
