No Joda Lyrics ["no fuck" ft letter. Gryphus]

[Enter: Lord Dross & Gryphus]
Me
I, me
Hey, me, me
Shit in God
Me
I spent power
Hey
Me
I, me
Hey, me, me
I, me
I, hey, hey, me
I, me, hey, me
[Verse 1: lord dross]
I woke up, in front of the PC I sat
Breakfast I already took, the mail Checar√©
Game suggestions' by mail? What a palurdo
How many updates this week? One or two?
Reviews or games? I see it later
Cel sounds', it's the fat
Are you going home? Do not fuck!
I shout that no, does not understand the brute
It seems deaf, fat deaf, does not fuck

[Chorus: Lord Dross & Gryphus]
No fuck
No fuck
No fuck, don't fuck
No fuck
No fuck
The Dross Diary

[Verse 2: Lord Dross]
He left, pussy! Tollear time
I open the msn to see who angry, hehe
The fat girl? But he just left
If you are already at home, what a damn fat ball
What happens?
He speaks to me, he puts me emoticons as if he were a girl
There is no time for that, I'm again a ninja
Shurikens flying, fat bouncing
Cone! In the mother they are giving me

No fuck
No fuck
No fuck, don't fuck
No fuck
No fuck
The Dross Diary

[Verse 3: Lord Dross]
I force her to put Burger in the conversation
He does not speak, puts the atomic bomb without vasila
"It's a damn, he doesn't want to talk to me"
It is a delicate and it is your fault, you cannot complain
"With Hot Wheels I wanted to quote"
Out the troll, I'm already bad, I think I'll have dinner
If I keep so I will gain weight
Like the fat I will stay
That wants, so we are
So that by Argentina we rode
That we run over people and that orphaned children leave

[Chorus: Lord Dross & Gryphus]
No fuck
Joda
The Dross Diary
[Outro: Lord Dross, Gryphus & Fripozo]
I shit on God, why don't they get fuck?
Keep so you can live!
Pussy of the ma -ah, fuck
Mother's pussy! Run, Marico!
[?] In rap, bastards
Out of here! Out! Embed
