Shot Me Down Lyrics[Verse: Skylar Grey]
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Bang! Wizzz! Zap! Pow!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Bang! Wizzz! Zap! Pow!
Bang! Wizzz! Zap! Pow!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
