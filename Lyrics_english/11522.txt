Didn’t Know What I Was in For Lyrics[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
My telephone, it doesn't have a camera
If it did I’d take a picture of myself
If it did I'd take a picture of the water
And the man on the offramp
Holding up the sign that's asking me for help

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
I got a job and I’ll work here for the summer
I fold the towels and set them by the pool
Everyone looks happy with each other
'Til they step away and say the thing they really meant
They always sound so cruel
[Chorus 1: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
I didn't know what I was in for
When I signed up for that run
There's no way I'm curing cancer
But I'll sweat it out
I feel so proud now for all the good I've done

[Verse 3: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
I know a girl who owns a boutique in the city
Selling clothes to the fashionably late
Says she cries at the news but doesn't really
’Cause it’s too much fun, there's too much time
And too much plastic money to be made

[Chorus 2: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
I didn’t know what I was in for
When they took my belt and strings
They told me I'd gone crazy
My arms are strapped in a straight jacket
So I couldn't save those TV refugees

[Bridge: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
When they're on their backs
In a bloody bath
Full of Sarin gas
On a screen

I didn’t know what I was in for
When I laid out in the sun
We get burned for being honest
I've really never done anything, for anyone

[Verse 4: Phoebe Bridgers & Conor Oberst]
To fall asleep I need white noise to distract me
Otherwise I have to listen to me think
Otherwise I pace around, hold my breath, let it out
Sit on the couch and think about
How living's just a promise that I made2Embed
