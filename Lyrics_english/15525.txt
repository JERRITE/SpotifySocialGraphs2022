Write me in the sky (live) Lyricsi you don't want to come back when I call you
If you don't want to come back, I'll understand
If your heartbeat
They keep saying no

Write me in heaven, write me in heaven
And I will know that wherever you are
Do not forget me
Write me in heaven, write me in heaven
If you ever need me I will go
You will see
I can't forget, even if I try
Your way of being got into me
Inside, so within me that until today
I live impregnated in your smell

Write me in heaven, write me in heaven
And I will know that wherever you are
Yet
Something of mine, challenging time
Is with you and forces you to think
A little in me

If your heartbeat
They keep saying no

Write me in heaven, write me in heaven
And I will know that wherever you are
Do not forget me
Shark the pen, write me in the sky
If you ever need me I will go
You will see

Write me in heaven, write me in heaven
And I will know that wherever you are
Yet
Something of mine, challenging time
Is with you and forces you to think
A little in me
A little in me
A little in Miyou Might Also Likeembed
