Break The Floor Lyrics[Intro]
Listen up
Break the floor, break

[Verse 1]
Hey plans wish I could pass
Said I'm stuck and he's decrazed
My wonder job they can talk tonight
I'm the core, dancing is fun life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The party's jumping (the party's jumping)
Everyone's moving (just everyone's moving)
You are the last time to cray (no, no)
The Dancefloor is rare (is, yeah)
[Chorus]
You know I'll be hard to break the floor
Shake, shake, shake the door
Watch the door come down
(You'll be moving day and through it down)
You know I'll be hard to break the floor
Shake, shake, shakе the door (door)
(Responsible you'll mouth)
Feel thе beat all pounding through the crowd

[Verse 2]
Three more classes you go
Till I'm about, dancefloor
Don't wanna be no math or magician
Cause dancing is my only amnesia

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The party's jumping (the party's jumping)
Everyone's moving (just everyone's moving)
You are the last time to go (oh no)
Dance is Iration (you know oh woah)

[Chorus]
You know I'll be hard to break the floor
Shake, shake, shake the door
Watch the door come down
(You'll be moving day and through it down)
You know I'll be hard to break the floor
Shake, shake, shake the door (door)
(Responsible you'll mouth)
Feel the beat all pounding through the crowd

Never let it stop now
Keep it ceiling everyday

Can solve this tears today (hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yay)
Wait (wait)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The party's jumping (the party's jumping)
Everyone's moving (just everyone's moving)
You are the last time to go (oh no)
