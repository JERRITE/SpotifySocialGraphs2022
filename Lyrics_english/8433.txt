I like Lyrics (Chorus)
I like you, you look for me, you find me you take me
I like you, you look for me, things get confusing, but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me, nothing is the same but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me, nothing is the same ...

When you look for me, I'm just going to you
I like you very sad if
I don't have you here, I'm your mannequin
You are bad but you make me very happy
With having you in my broken dreams
I behind you, you behind others
You have turned crazy to all soon
You look out of the brightness of his eyes
You use me and then leave
Until you need a little more
You will soon come back and eat
These doubts, and the hours of peace
Baby I'm your junkie you are my answer
Breathe the funky with party smell
I'm going to burn from head to toe
With this sample of fresh music
(Chorus)
I like you, you look for me, you find me you take me
I like you, you look for me, things get confusing, but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me. Nothing is the same but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me. Nothing is the same...

In ash, you transformed in a hurry
Princess you calm me
Weigh me because you step on me
You have made me trizas
It is many years without letting us go
There are serious damage to love you like this
You my great passion today my great prison
The pressure for not having a decision
If you sign up right in my heart
You control my cells and rightly
All your benefits are an obsession
You know how to give me soft moments
Baby I'm your junkie you are my answer
Breathe the funky with party smell
I'm going to burn from head to toe
With this sample of fresh music

(Chorus)
I like you, you look for me, you find me you take me
I like you, you look for me, things get confusing, but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me. Nothing is the same but
I look like it makes me fly, then
He takes me. Nothing is the same...

Live in my house sleep with me
It gives me coat when I feel cold
Today a friend brought to make a trio
What can I say just let
Thrown into bed like Super Star
I began to float just for being in a place distant to others
You use me and then leave
Until you need a little more
You will soon come back and eat
These doubts, and the hours of peace
Baby I'm your junkie you are my answer
Breathe the funky with a Yesca smell
I'm going to burn from head to toe
With this sample of fresh music
