Go Through It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fuck 'em, these people in yo life don't give a fuck when
You coming up from nothing
Walkin' round in shirts with missing buttons
And yo spirits like that doormat
You wonder where that chrome at
Blast!
All black after aftermath
Yah blood stains the floor board at yah momma's pad
She walks in crying, blind sided
Her only son dying
She lost at the fact that she had no idea
Now she holding you close, drenched in tears
Now you gone and yo ghost watch in fear
You shout out with aggression, "Momma it was depression, I kept it all under suppression!"
But she can't hear
It's all regret if you do it
Now put it down, don't be stupid
You got a lot to live, for you don't know it yet
It don't happen overnight, you gonna have to bear the stress
But it don't last long
[Chorus]
So don't do it
Yeah I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mind
Don't do it
I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mind

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I done been there man
Quickly found a distraction, and now my pen go ham
But now you think about action, and if I really went through with it
Wouldn't hear me in music or in my vids doing stupid shit
You wouldn't know I exist
I'd be rottin' in the grave where my family would sit
It's really crazy how life works out
I went from being a bum to someone's favorite person now
And it's humbling, when I feel I'm crumbling
I think 'bout all the people who pick me up when I'm stumbling, yah
You can be in the same position
I know it seem impossible, but nigga I'm the witness

[Chorus]
So don't do it
Yeah I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mind
Don't do it
I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mind
So don't do it
Yeah I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mind
Don't do it
I know you sick of living this life
But go through it 'cause trust me, I been right in yah mindYou might also likeEmbed
