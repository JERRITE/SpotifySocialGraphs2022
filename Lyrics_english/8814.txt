Frenzy LyricsWuy, la la, we're just chillin', chillin'
Whoa, oh, ah, yeah, hey

Me and my frenzy, on the enzy
Smokin' sensi sippin' on some Hennessey
Living up, living up, living up, living up
Surround by fine ladies, dainty babies

Rockin' and jiggin' to songs of all ages
Living up, living up, living up, living up
To all of my jiggas and mic emcees
Hand inna the air if you love ladies
If yuh can show yuh hand
You a chi chi, you're not in my category
Rollin' my truck, buckle up
Girls pull me asking me, "What's up?"

Living up living up, living up living up
So we roll along to Wendy's parked her ride
She and her friends, then stepped inside
Living up, living up, living up, living up
To all of my jiggas and mic emcees
Hand inna the air if you love ladies

If yuh can show yuh hand, you a chi chi
You're not in my category, see
All of my jiggas and mic emcees

Hand inna the air if you love ladies
If yuh can show yuh hand, you a chi chi
You're not in my category

'Cause we nuh wan no chi chi man bow yah
And if you par with chi chi man yuh can stay on yah, oh
We nuh waan no chi chi man bow, yah
And if you par with chi chi, man, yuh can stay on yah

So we roll along to North Beach and to South Beach
Down inna Palm Beach where I and I man reach
Living up, living up, living up, living up

Turn on my DVD you know what I mon mean
Living up living up, living up living up

To all of my jiggas and mic emcees
Hand inna the air if you love ladies
If yuh can show yuh hand, you a chi chi
You're not in my category

A we nuh wan no chi chi man bow yah
And if you par with chi chi, man, yuh can stay on yah
We nuh wan no chi chi man bow yah
And if you par with chi chi, man, yuh can stay on yah

Yo, ooh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah ay

All of my jiggas and mic emcees
Hand inna the air if you love ladies
If yuh can show yuh hand, you a chi chi
You're not in my category

All of my jiggas and mic emcees
Hand inna the air if you love ladies
If yuh can show yuh handEmbed
