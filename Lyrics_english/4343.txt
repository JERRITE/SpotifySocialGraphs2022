A love like you lyrics [intro]
UHH, UHH
(Julio Voltio)
A love like you
(In the clear)
UHH, UHH, UOOHH
Baby
What happened ma
This is for you, you know
I spent looking for me
[See 1: volt]
I have warrriated
Huh eh enjoyed
With a thousand women I have tangled up
Too
For the darkest
And dark huh
I have known what to be up
And be off
I have done almost everything in this life
I have seen without departure
Lost hope
But before the light goes out
I want to tell you, I have found a love like your ma

[Chorus: Arcangel]
I have spent trying in the world wanted
A love like you
(Like you)
I have no strength I can no longer find
(Mommy)
A love like you
I have spent trying in the world searched
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
A love like you

(Searching)
Uuhhh, uhhh
(Hears)
A love like you
Uuhhh, uhhhun
(One Love)
Uuhhh, uhhh
(Like you)
Uuoohhh

[Interlude: Arcangel]
In my life a lot of my suffered
You don't know how many tears eh spilled
Today I feel loved
And I thank God that to my life today you have arrived

No no no no
(Baby)
No no no no
(Thanks god)
No no no no
(To find you)
No no no no
[See 2: volt]
Thank God that put you on my way
I did not believe in destiny
For giving me a beautiful family
I thank you
For treating me and giving me what I don't even deserve
The reason I write this song
I wanted to clean my soul and my heart
I know that I have behaved like a thief
For stealing your joy I apologize

[Chorus: Arcangel]
I have spent trying in the world wanted
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
(I do not can)
A love like you

[See 3: volt]
For you I see the life of another color
I don't feel the pain
Accustomed to your smell
At night your heat
Who would say I thought would never know love
I want you to be happy with me or without me
You know what 'toy pa you
After having lost so long out there
I understood what I look for this in front of me

[Outro: Arcangel & Voltio]
I have spent trying in the world wanted
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
A love like you
I have spent trying in the world searched
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
A love like you
I have spent trying in the world wanted
(Julio Voltio)
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
A love like you
I have spent trying in the world searched
A love like you
I have no strength I can no longer find
A love like you
(Julio Voltio)
I have spent trying in the world searched
(With Archangel the wonder haha)
A love like you
(The old and the new school)
I have no strength I can no longer find
(The most shining)
A love like tuembed
