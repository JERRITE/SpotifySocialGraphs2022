Perfectly Blind LyricsMy wide eyes, straight with red lines
Visions of me and you
Shattered in a day like broken glass

Perfectly blind, (said I'm perfectly blind)
Perfectly blind, (please somebody help me)
Perfectly blind, (I need an answer)
Perfectly blind, perfectly

Mind is worn, heart is torn
Violently craving
A substitute for you, (a substitute)
These eyes see darkness
These eyes see through
These eyes are begging
These eyes are you

Perfectly blind,(perfectly blind)
Perfectly blind, (Oh)
Perfectly blind, (I don't know what I'm gonna do right now)

Perfectly blind, (Said I am)

Could you take me as I am?
I'm just a scarred man
These hands need your guidance
Take me past my circumstance

Perfectly blind, (blind)
Perfectly blind, (I cannot see anything when your around me)
Perfectly blind, (So blind)
Perfectly blind, (So, Oh Oh)

So blind, so blind, so blind, so blind
But it's okay, (but it's okay)(perfectly blind)
I wanna be lost in you, (lost in you)(perfectly blind)
I wanna be lost in you (perfectly blind)
Feel free to lead me where you want me to go (perfectly blind)
And yes I'm going to follow, (follow), oh ohYou might also likeEmbed
