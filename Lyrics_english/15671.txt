Humans to Mars Lyricste Quero as I never wanted before
I love you because I have natural
Because we fail as lovers
Não thought, em tudo sou abnormal

And in my solitude
When I want to go looking for you
When you look at the moon and it's not
When humans get to Mars
LOOK, I WILL LEAVE THE LIFE PASSING
When you intend to marry
When you know that I can no longer
You will kiss with that work of art
To this crazy one who can no longer
Uooah ahh!

I wait for you to love true
I have to give you
Ace Flores, or Carinho, to Vontade
With you life to be

E vou confess
When I see meu love, distant
Olho or céu e nem a lua is
Human Chegariam à Mars
Eu na janela I sell to Vida Passar

When you intend to marry
When you know that I can no longer
You will kiss with that work of art
To this crazy one who can no longer
Uooah ahh!

Light that guides or meu feel
And that I face me click
Você knows that love kills me
You might also like that eu vou waiting
What about the provar
Esse love of true

And in my solitude
When I want to go looking for you
Olho or Céu
When humans get to Mars
Eu na Janela

When you intend to marry
Semi -toworm to nortine
You will kiss with that work of art
Um destiny pra você I find me

Light that guides or meu feel
And that I face me click
Você knows that love kills me

Say to eu eu tô here
Because vou lhe show
Or sense of loving

Tell him in my soul
That my universe desperate
Tell him I want to hug her
I can't wait
That time ends
E vou confess
When I see meu love, distant
Olho or céu e nem a lua is
Human Chegariam à Mars
Eu na janela I sell to Vida Passar

When you intend to marry
When you know that I can no longer
You will kiss with that work of art
To this crazy one who can no longer

E vou confess
When I see meu love, distant
Olho or céu e nem a lua is
Human Chegariam à Mars
Eu na janela I sell to Vida Passar

When you intend to marry
When you know that I can no longer
You will kiss with that work of art
To this crazy one who can no longer morembed
