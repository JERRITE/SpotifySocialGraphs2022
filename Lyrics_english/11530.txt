Forest Lawn Lyrics[Verse 1: Conor Oberst]
You used to sing with a straight face "Que Sera, Sera"
And drive those perfumed queens back to our place in a velvet box
And then make your move

[Chorus: Conor Oberst]
Since you went underground
I've wanted to track you down
Since you went underground
I've wanted to dig you out
[Verse 2: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
You used to sing with a straight face "My Heart Will Go On"
And bring those tattooed freaks back to our place in a mason jar
You had something to prove

[Chorus: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
Since you went underground
I've wanted to track you down
Yeah, since you went underground
I've wanted to dig you out

[Bridge: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
You pass out quick
You lack ambition
Why does everybody always end up in the kitchen?
The man in white slacks sure looks dangerous
And I heard the short one's kind of famous

[Verse 3: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
You used to say you wanted to end up in Forest Lawn
The two of us side by side asleep while the teenagers drink 'til dawn
Please tell me it's true

[Chorus: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
Since you went underground
I've wanted to track you down
Since you went underground
I've wanted to dig you out

You used to sing with a straight face "Que Sera, Sera"Embed
