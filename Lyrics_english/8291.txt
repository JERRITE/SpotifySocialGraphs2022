Ladies

[Verse 1]
It’s like you're caught up in a maze
You keep on goin' in circles, girl, and you’re tryna find your way out
But it's time I put on my cape
And put that "S" on my chest, girl, I wanna come and save you, but I'm stuck
[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m stuck in the middle of seein' you hurt
I know when you love him, and you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I'd knew you first
It’s gettin' louder, girl, can’t ignore it no more, I can't

[Chorus]
I can hear your heart
Cryin' out for me (Cryin' out for me)
I can hear your heart
Cryin' out for me, yeah (And it keeps on sayin')
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (And it keeps on sayin')
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (I can, baby)
I can hear your heart (Ooh-ooh)
Cryin' out for me

[Verse 2]
Baby, I should’ve never caught no feelings, but
Baby, havin' late night conversations on your sofa
You tellin' me how he played you out over and over
Over and over

[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m stuck in the middle of seein' you hurt
I know when you love him, and you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I knew you first
It’s gettin' louder, girl, I can’t ignore it no more, baby
