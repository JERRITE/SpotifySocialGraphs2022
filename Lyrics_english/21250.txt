Ship of Lies LyricsTake it out your pocket
Let it zoom up like a rocket
You sitting on the fence
When you should walk it like you talk it
Been down this road before
There's just too much to ignore
When I say it out loud
I can't settle the score
I've put my foot in my mouth
It erases all doubt
I get the shakes hit the brakes
'Cause you know I'm freaking out
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies

Make it up now
Make it up now
Make it up now
You're doing better
Can't keep a good man down
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies

Pick it up, duke it out
Time to get loud
I'm tired of shutting down
I wanna scream it out now
I'm always at eleven
But they keep me on the rack
Top shelf baby
Got the balls to have your back
Nobody tells me nothing
In the shadows counting stacks
Put me in the spotlight
'Cause I'm ready to attack
Come on

It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies

Make it up now
Make it up now
Make it up now
You're doing better
Can't keep a good man down
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies

Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies

Make it up now
Make it up now
Make it up now
You're doing better
Can't keep a good man down
Everybody knows
It's getting old
Let's sink this ship of lies
You gotta lay out what you gonna shake down
Try something new tell the truth before it comes out
You gotta lay out what you gonna shake down
Try something new tell the truth before it comes out
You gotta lay out what you gonna shake down
Try something new tell the truth before it comes out
You gotta lay out what you gonna shake down
Try something new - tell the truthEmbed
