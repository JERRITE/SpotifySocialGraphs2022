All My Heroes (Curbi Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whatever mess you're in
The demons you've been fightin'
Know that your quest is only just beginning
Everything you've been through
Has led you to this moment, focus
Be present, let your spirit guide you
Now that you're on your way
Wherever you walk you radiate
And you create the destiny
[Pre-Drop]
Let me-

[Drop]
(Push it like that)
L-L-L-Let me-
(Push it like that)
(Push it like that)

[Chorus]
All my heroes, let me hear you
All my heroes, let mе hear you

[Pre-Drop]
Let me-

[Drop]
(Push it likе that)
(Push it like that)
(Push it like that)
