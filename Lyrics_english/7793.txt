Save Your Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got to feel love
You've got to feel love
You've got to feel love
Nothing between

They can't have you
Keeping you for myself
They can't have you
Me and no one else
They can't have you
I won't let you down
I can't let you go
[Chorus]
I'm gonna save your life
I'm gonna save your life

[Verse 2]
You must believe I'm on your side
You've got to breathe to be alive, babe

I won't let you down
Let you down, down
I won't let you down
Let you down, down
I won't let you down
Let you down, down
I won't let you down
Let you down, down

[Chorus]
I'm gonna save your life
I'm gonna save your lifeYou might also likeEmbed
