I finally found Lyricsletra from "I finally found you" ft. Juan Magán & Sebastian Yatra

[Enter: Cali & El Dandee]
Oh oh hey
Cali & el Dandee Yo
Hee Juan Magán
Sebastián Yatra

[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra]
If you knew that I am dying for you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
If you knew what I have expected
That I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
[Chorus: Dandee]
And they told me they saw you alone
Because you are alone?
Release the past and let me be the one who falls in love (the one who falls in love)
And they told me they saw you alone
Why so alone?
If you by my side you will have the one who loves you the most
(Juan Magan)

[Verse 1: Juan Magán]
Tell me why so alone, alone
At this time, hours
I just want to know about you
Dance with me now, now
And forget others
I'm yours...
Make me what you want AA
I have feelings in order AA
I almost notice the wait AA
That you are finally single ah
I throw a look and give me game over
And so I can't
I give myself and tell him you can be my love
I release the brake
I throw a look and give me game over
And so I can't
I give myself and tell him you can be my love
I release the brake

When you look at me I look at you and die
No one loves you as I love you
No one sees you how I can see you
Because if you leave me I will take you to heaven
I will make you songs with sincere love
I will be your sun this dawn

[Chorus: All]
And finally I found you (no no)
I finally found you (no no)
I finally found you (no no)
I finally found you (no no)

[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra]
If you knew that I am dying for you
I love you, I love you, I love you
If you knew what I have expected

[Chorus: Dandee]
And they told me they saw you alone
Because you are alone?
Release the past and let me be the one who falls in love
And they told me they saw you alone
Why so alone?
If you by my side you will have the one who loves you the most
[Verse 2: dandee]
With me you will not be alone
Today comes time
I have the recipe for us to fly
Together at the Boreal Aurora
This love is immortal
I always love you
And I go with you until the end

[Verse 3: Cali]
Tell me that I am me, the one you see by your side
That when I'm close, you forget the past
And I can see it, tell me what are you going to do
I want to have you

[Verse 4: Juan Magán]
I throw a look and give me game over
And so I can't
I give myself and tell him you can be my love
I release the brake
I throw a look and give me game over
And so I can't
I give myself and tell him you can be my love
I release the brake

[Pre-car: All]
When you look at me I look at you
And I'm dying
No one loves you as I love you
No one sees you how I can see you
Because if you leave me I will take you to heaven
I will make you songs with sincere love
I will be your sun this dawn

[Outro: all]
And finally I found you (no no) (Yeah)
I finally found you (no no)
(Cali & el Dandee me)
I finally found you (no no)
(Juan Magan)
I finally found you (no no) embed
