Life is like that Lyrics [lyrics by "Life is like that"]

[Verse 1]
I have received a call, they told me that they saw you
I don't want buts, nor jealousy
Save your scene do not give me excuses, pa '
I will not listen, so calm it down
I know everything, they told me about her
They told me their life and they really do sorry for me
If you believe that with my arms crossed I will stay
I look in the mirror, comb my hair and make up
A short dress, do you know what I tell you?
I will ride my car because I know your direction
What a female female of this woman
Hi, daring I bring you news
And that's why it's my smile and I'll give it to you without a hurry
The man with whom he is mine and you know
But here is the detail in bed is not worth
That's why I came to congratulate you about what you got me
And I have to confess you
While I take their time to someone I am seeing it
A real man and not the garbage that I have
[Chorus]
Life is so
If the leftovers of another makes you happy
Here is the detail
I give it to you for all the suffering
And the damage that has caused
Life is so
Now I shout alive that with someone I am happy
Someone who consents to me
It treats me different, it takes me by your hand and tells me what you feel

[Interlude]
(So ​​Calm it)
(So ​​Calm it)
(So ​​Calm it)
(So ​​Calm it)
That's how it is
Let her cry, dad

[Verse 2]
Save your excuses that I have another
I will silence your mouth and take what touches you
What is done here has to pay
Don't stop my place, you don't have to return

I have someone who loves me at last (I have who loves me)
I have who touches me (I have who touches me)
Someone who deserves and his love grows me
It makes me feel great, someone who for me pray
I have someone who loves me at last (I have who loves me)
I have who touches me (I have who touches me)
Here is the detail if you do not take care of yours
Another will arrive and make it feel yours
(That's the way, life is like that, Dad)

[Chorus]
Life is so
If the leftovers of another makes you happy
Here is the detail
I give it to you for all the suffering
And the damage that has caused
Life is so
Now I shout alive that with someone I am happy
Someone who consents to me
It treats me different, it takes me by your hand and tells me what you feel
