By kissing you Lyrics [verse 1]
And you haven't given me time to hide you
What I want to love you
That for a kiss I can conquer the sky
And leave my life behind

[Verse 2]
I want to belong to be something in your life
That you can love me
With a strong hug to make you a poetry
Give up
[Pre-Car 1]
And in each hidden phrase of what you say
In a kiss will speak
I have no doubt just come and listen
Let's decide to start

[Chorus]
For kissing you
My life would change in a second
You would be my balance, my destiny
Kiss me and just then I can have you
Eternally in my mind

[Verse 3]
A single attempt is enough at this time
To know
If we still have time to be in the middle
What will happen

[Pre-Coro 2]
With me there is no danger they see you
The distance is not
Reason for oblivion here I am with you
And forever I will be

[Chorus]
For kissing you
My life would change in a second
You would be my balance, my destiny
Kiss me and just then I can have you
Eternally in my mind
