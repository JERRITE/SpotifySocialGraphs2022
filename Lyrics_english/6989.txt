Butterflies Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
I just wanna know, would you catch me if I fall?

[Verse 1]
You came, came into my life
Then made everything bright again
I was once in a dark place (Place)
I remember when you told me
You were scared to fall in love again
Still, you found a way to fall for me
[Chorus]
I-I still get butterflies
Crazy how we vibe
Even when we fight
I-I still get butterflies
Crazy how we vibe
Even when we fight

[Verse 2]
Let's go everywhere together
Turn two years into forever
We'll make diamonds under pressure
And turn the pain into pleasure
I wanna have your last name
No matter how long it takes
You always make me feel so safe
And that’s how I know you're worth the wait

[Chorus]
I-I still get butterflies
Crazy how we vibe
Even when we fight
I-I still get butterflies
Crazy how we vibe
Even when we fight
You might also like[Outro]
Safe to say I know that you'll catch me when I fall
Now I got you here, boy, I'm givin' you my all
Dangerously in love, I don't ever wanna leave
I know you feel the same, you're the only one I see (See)
