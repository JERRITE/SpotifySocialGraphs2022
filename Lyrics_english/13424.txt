Killer Lyrics ["Killer"] letter]

[Intro: Darell]
Everybody Go to the DiscoTak!

[Pre-stribe: Brytiago]
Damn that day I tried you
May God forgive me, I don't even want to see you
Ere 'a murderer, a devil in body' e woman
Ghost that appears, and does not appear again
[Chorus: Brytiago, Darell]
I don't vo 'to deny you that hard you see you' (that is like that)
It may be that drunk one day returns and give you (so you know ')
I hope and end 'as the last sees' (by law)
That is the one who falls in love and not to see me 'to see me (it's the real Rondón, ra-ta-ta-ta)

[Verse 1: Darell]
You are a serious problem (Já!)
Because you have no heart, he is already dead in the cemetery (that is like that)
Do not listen to intermediates
That get out of the middle
Without condom with you, I'm going to the criteria
When we are together ', mommy, everything is beautiful
You know I don't snack much, but I have more than them (Já-Já!)
You, you, that the phillie seal it
When the note uploads, put on four in what I crash you (real g4 life, my nigga)
That guy has hated you (he hated)
You say you are confusing (confusing)
I fight you 'and night and fight you' and day
But you ere 'masoquista because it is still' there (there I got)
I will give you hard for growing (by growing)
I will pull your hair for Lucia (for Lucia)
Pégate to give you a neighborhood
And when I get the other day I will tell me na 'lost

[Chorus: Brytiago, Darell]
I don't vo'a denying you how hard you see you '
It may be that drunk one day returns and give you
I hope and end 'how the last sees'
That is the one who falls in love and that does not see me 'to see (see again, Brytiago, Wouh)

Malicious, you always have what you want
It only looks for me 'every time it suits you (that is like that)
It gets difficult, your pride is not who stops it
As much as Brinque 'and Salte', Baby, here you die '(Já-já!)
And now you are well loose
Two drinks and I turn around (pa 'what knows')
To make a pact the devil tempts me
Playing with my mind you are an expert
Among that 'legs you have' powers
That's why I'm still here even if you fight
Tell you no, you can't
I will not deny that the key has it '
But fighting, you are fifty and zero to Mayweather

[Chorus: Brytiago]
I don't vo'a denying you how hard you see you '
It may be that drunk one day returns and give you
I hope and end 'how the last sees'
That is the one who fell in love with you and not to see me '
