Velitas Lyrics ["Velitas" letter]

[Intro: Brytiago & Darell]
(Attention, Attention Around the World
The Real Rond칩n, Brytiago)
She wants to leave it, but it is not decided (Nekxum!)
He likes the bad and the body asks for it
Whenever he is dead, I give and relive him (that is like that)
When he feels bad, there (here we; ah!; Here we go!)
With me wants to connect (OH-OH)
I always listen to her and let her rise (that is like that)
'T치 looking for an excuse for being left
Of the bad thing they have done is going to take revenge (ra-ta-ta-t치!)
[Choir: Brytiago & Darell]
I always give him hard (tra!), And he never takes me away (hah, hah)
I put it in four, there and it looks pretty (that is, that's how, like that)
I get it and take it out, I love it when shouts
The Bellaqueo turns on, the champagne 'and the candles' (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I always give it hard and never take me away (what knows)
I put it in four, there and it looks pretty
I get it and take it out, I love it when shouts
THE BELLAQUEO Light, Las Champagne 'And Las Velita'

[Verse 1: Darell]
(Listen to me, listen to me)
That boyfriend of yours and 'Plumi Gucci (ESO E' like this)
Quiet, I am with the cut in the Estuchi (hah!)
And that bastard does not buy you or sushi (OH-OH)
And I will give you to give you that you see Gucci
Gucci, what e 'what you want', Cuchi-Cuchi
What takes you chocolate 'with the peluchi? (He we go!)
Put on the fucci color panty
And I said it in English: "Only want to fuck the pussy" (Stop that shit)
Lero-Lero, Mommy, for you I leave to 'the leather' (oh my God)
'T치 well, your boyfriend says that E' Kreero (I like it your booty, mommy)
I promise you a true dust
And mommy, if you behave well, you will make you make the whole body (he we go!)
That is why in your 'rede' 'toy pending (slope)

Pa 'apply, ma', with the powerful (oh-oh)
Tell me how it feels, look for here, that the eyes do not lie

The cursa 'is noticeable in the eye' (in the eye ', Yeh)
I'm still waiting for me to call me 'because I am like you
With you dispossession (wuh)
He believes your owner, but he doesn't even know
That they talk to you badly you like
And posse in possess you have to change (what to change)
And that the danger does not scare you
Let's go another one, but after enroll (of Enrolo, Yeh)
He likes the candles' because it's a Bicthy-Bicky
It has a weight 'inverted in culichy
Shout by the sensation and loosen the button
Because when Balenciaga is hot, look for his Christian Dior
Face clothes, look face
He likes to see himself on the spot and asked me to record it
Much bla-bla and do nothing
And tell your little boyfriend that one, who also shoots here
(Ra-ta-ta!)
