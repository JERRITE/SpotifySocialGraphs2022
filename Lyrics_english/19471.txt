Don’t Give a Damn Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hip Hop welcome out
I be whoopin' ass like my belt was out
Just for the record, I don't smoke but
I might light it up if I was down at Michael Phelps's house
I'm just a young kid raised on a rough block
Where the number one phrase is 'fuck cops'
And we all carry blades and buck shots
But I'm tryna make a change before my luck stops
Drink triple, see double, act single
That's the motto of the generation that I hang around with
Who the hell gon' do the right thing in a world
Full of trouble man I feel like I'm surrounded
My name is the one ya' found
And I owe my fame to the underground
If you're chasing dreams you gotta run 'em down
But take a break for a minute, it's the summer now
[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like
Lending you a hand
Come with me tonight
Cause I'mma set you free tonight, girl
Sometimes I feel like
I don't give a damn
Run with me tonight
I'm giving you the keys tonight
To my world
And it feels alright
And it feels okay
Cause I don't give a fuck anyway
Sometimes I feel like
I don't give a damn

[Verse 2]
I shine baby kiss the light
And every single morning is a gift of life
I fly through the sky never miss a flight
Now every single girl calls me Mr. Right, I'm like woah…
When it comes to speed of women I like slow
Never know who else these women just might know
So many brothers out there actin' like they never heard
The story 'bout Billie Jean and Michael
I suppose the money owns you
You don't own it, like you're supposed to
You don't know shit, let me coach you
Just don't quit, But I told you
My name is the one ya' found
And I owe my fame to the underground
If you're chasing dreams you gotta run 'em down
But take a break for a minute, it's the summer now
You might also like[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like
Lending you a hand
Come with me tonight
Cause I'mma set you free tonight, girl
Sometimes I feel like
I don't give a damn
Run with me tonight
I'm giving you the keys tonight
To my world
And it feels alright
And it feels okay
Cause I don't give a fuck anyway
Sometimes I feel like
I don't give a damn

[Bridge]
This is my heart and soul, my life is all I know
So it's been nice that I could also see my money grow
This is my heart and soul, my life is all I know
So it's been nice that I could also see my money grow
This is my heart and soul, my life is all I know
So it's been nice that I could also see my money grow
This is my heart and soul, my life is all I know
So it's been nice that I could also see my money grow
Grow, grow, grow, grow, I've grown
Grow, grow, grow grow
Run with me tonight
I'm giving you the key tonight
To my world5Embed
