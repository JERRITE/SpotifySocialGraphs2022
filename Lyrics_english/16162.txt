Miss Popularity Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's a walking casting call
A fashion runway doll
Her 4.0 comes naturally
She's good at everything
She's got a following
And an entourage of copy queens
No need to try out for the school play
You know she'll get the lead anyway

[Chorus]
She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
Miss Popularity
[Verse 2]
She wears the cutest clothes
She has the latest phone
And all the right accessories
Her skin's like porcelain
Her hair is perfect and
Sometimes she really gets to me
She's gorgeous and you know she knows it
She's a size zero and she loves to show it, yeah

[Chorus]
She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
Miss Popularity

She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
Miss Popularity

[Bridge]
She's every teacher's pet
There ain't no guy that she can't get
Her daddy Ken is loaded
And her mommy drives a pink Corvette
You might also likeOooh whoa whoa whoa
Oooh whoa whoa
Oooh whoa whoa
Working hard to be
Oh
Miss Popularity

[Chorus]
She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
Miss Popularity

She's the girl that you love to hate
She's a heart stopping double take
Everyone knows that she's got it made
Working hard to be
