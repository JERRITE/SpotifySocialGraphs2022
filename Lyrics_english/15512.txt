Guadalajara Lyrics [lyrics for "Guadalajara" ft. Summer Cem]

[Intro: Bausa]
EY, EY, EY, yes
Juh-Juh-Dee on the Beat (Oh)

[Part 1: Bausa]
Middle finger for the police (EH)
Hang on my ass like a trouser leg (ey)
Living legend like Kobe Bryant
So much style should be prohibited (yes)
Friday I install a few drugs (scratched)
Run through the city without top
And I hear how the grandma's scream (ehh)
"How can you be so bad?"
Cocaine à la Christoph Daum
Lay on the limit at the limit (yes)
Drive the hangover out with whiskey (skrrt)
My life is a fucked dream (yes)
Powerbausa takes over the business
I was nobody back then, now I'm your boss
At that time your wife didn't want me yet
But believe me, that's what I'll fuck her now
If I say something, then the law is
Expensive fusel, but cheaper sex
Summer fucks your olle an hour
And then the building comes and gives it the rest
[Pre-Hook: Bausa]
Huh!
Aiaiai, Aiaiai
Hehehe, ey, yes

[Hook: Bausa & Summer Cem]
Guadalajara, Oh
Bags are full to the brim with para
Baby, let's go, oh
We fly to Mexico
Guadalajara, EY
Bags are full to the brim with para
Give me the rest, hey
We are flying to Mexico now
Guadala—
(Yes, yes, oh!)

[Part 2: Summer Cem]
Look, your daughter is Ladylike
'A mixture of sexy cora and katy price
Lad 'you on vodka and baileys
Say, how can you be blessed by God? (Wooh)
Baby, my head is on Edelweiß
Today I smell to musk and training sweat (yes)
Run into the club with machete
Fast fucker pants in Rocco-Siffredi-Style (Huh)
We dance to "Breathless through the night"
Today it is merciless again (merciless)
Your looks, the hair, the look is blatant
If you are too tired, I wear you piggyback (piggyback)
Buyaka, Buyaka (Buyaka)
With me are Bausa, Hamadi and Nurullah (Nurullah)
I want to feel you, baby, full contact
Take yourself on the Fijis by luxury yacht (luxury yacht)
The others are nice, but you are blatant (you are blatant)
For you I start a ball (pap-pap)
I don't know what you are doing in the future
Baby, I have enough money, brings school off
You Might So Like [Pre-Hook: Bausa]
Huh!
Aiaiai, Aiaiai
Hehehe, ey, yes

[Hook: Bausa]
Guadalajara, Oh
Bags are full to the brim with para
Baby, let's go, oh
We fly to Mexico
Guadalajara, EY
Bags are full to the brim with para
Give me the rest, hey
We are flying to Mexico now
Guadala—
Guadala - Oh2embed
