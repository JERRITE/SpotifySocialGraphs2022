So Much It Hurts Lyrics[Intro]
Bring, bring your love

[Verse 1]
Oh, I ask you where you've been
Cause you always come home late nowadays
What a fool was I to think that we were safe
From the thieves in the temple
And I go out by myself dancing
And when I come home late, I don't wanna go to bed
I just sit there by the phone â€“ dead silent
Not a single call from you
Thieves in the temple
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, but if you said that
For better for worse
You would always be there for me
Always be there for me
Always be there for me
Better for worse, for me
Always be there
You would always be there for me

[Chorus]
Bring it back! Ooh!
I need your love so much it hurts
Oh, won't you bring it back? Ooh!
I need your love so much it hurts
Oh, won't you bring it back?

[Verse 2]
After all that we've been through together
Is it now you gonna throw it all away?
Oh, a love like ours
Tell me, was it worth it?
The thieves in the temple

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, but you said that
For better or for worse
You would always be there for me
Always be there for me
Always be there for me
Like I always sit there for you
Good times and bad times
I'll always be there for you

Bring it back! Ooh!
I need your love so much it hurts
Oh, won't you bring it back? Ooh!
I need your love so much it hurts

[Hook]
Oh, won't you bring your love back?
Bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me

[Outro]
What was I thinking, babe, yeah?
I need you
Oh, won't you bring it back, yeah?
I need your love so much it hurts
Oh, won't you bring your love back?
Bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me
Bring your love back, bring your love back to me
Bring your love back to me1Embed
