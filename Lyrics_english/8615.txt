Donâ€™t Tear Me Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Life is rich
But it's way too short
You make a lot of money
But you just want more
I don't need the pain
Right here in my heart
But I hate every minute
When we're so far apart, yeah

It was love in a minute
It was love in a flash
It brings me no pleasure
Just a stab in the back
It brings me no comfort
It brings me no peace
It's a weight on my shoulder
It's a fatal disease
[Chorus]
So don't tear me up
I don't ever wanna see your picture again
And don't poison my blood
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more

[Verse 2]
Gonna finish it quick
Gonna finish it clean
Don't wanna be bitter
I don't wanna be mean
I feel like we're driving
Down a dead-end street, yeah
I've come so far, I wanna crash the car
I wanna land right on my feet

[Chorus]
I said don't tear me up
I don't ever wanna see your picture again
I said don't tear me up
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more

[Verse 3]
But I dream of you constantly
You'll be my angel of light
And in the dark rooms of sleeplessness
You'll be my lover each night

Life is a bitch
It's way too short
Unlike a politician, it just can't be bought
Think about the tenderness
And think about the craziness
And if you ever wanna hate me
Come and stick a knife right in my chest

[Chorus]
I said don't tear me up
I don't ever wanna see your picture again
I said don't tear me up
I don't ever wanna see your face here no more
I said don't tear me up
I said don't tear me up
I said don't poison my blood
I don't ever wanna see your picture againEmbed
