With you I want Lyrics [lyrics by "With you I want"]

[Intro: genius "the mutant"]
Hi babe
Well already in my house of you '
Ah, how good
I would like when I see it, my love
He remembers that I wait for him, baby, Muah!
Yeh

[Verse 1: genius "the mutant"]
Hello, how are you going? (How are you going?) (Ah)
I know we don't talk a long time ago
But tell me, where are you? (-They)
If you are still in the same place (-gar; same place)
I go back home, and I don't want to arrive (-gar)
I just want to see you (I want to know about you)
And if I admit that I gave myself a couple of glasses (obliga ')
And you know that I am not to take
But when I take I get bad (you know 'how e')
And if we talk about the place (-gar)
Celar would be many women (aha)
But I didn't stop thinking, but it's ironic (how strange)
Like e 'that' toy surrounded by so many (ah)
But it is the one I wanted
It is something illogical (-co; well, good)
Give me the green that I want to eat you
I'm anxious to have you
[Chorus: J Alvarez & Genius "The Mutant"]
With you I want (wuh; aha)
I want to wear it whole (only if you leave me)
I just got out of the Putero (-tero)
'Toy on' and eat you want (auh), seriously, ouh (aj√°)
And at the discretion (come for here), I'm going to see you by hair
I know you also want, it's not a mystery
Today is a burial night, and not in the cemetery (Yah)
Uoh-oh, uoh-oh, oh-oh (hey me)

[Verse 2: genius "the mutant"]
Let's talk in front is better (it's better)
Thus heat is transmitted (heat)
Remove the insurance at the door
And don't wear anything (aha), just a babydoll (Babydoll)
That parasite that does not call you (na ')
That your chubby is better (it is better)
Put the air in high, the note does not fall
I'm one hundred eating the Toll
Your movements are working
Baby, as my .40 and the .9 (and .9)
I'm not sweet, but I have a palette to try it '(wow)
Round suit in a ziploc (ziploc)
Wait for it that saved the glock (the glock)
Put 'music, ballad or bachata or pop, I later' that is not rock
You said that whenever I called you (I called you)
If one day I felt desire (desire)
As you have not tried any, in bed you deserve a trophy (a trophy)
I wonder how a womanon (aha)
He has set such a ugly guy (so ugly)
He never asks for 'silver, your eyes betrays'
You get wrong with my chantees, genia!
