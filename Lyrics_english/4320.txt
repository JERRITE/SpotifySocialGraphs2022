Talk to me clear Lyricse-D-D-I-E!
Mommy!
Do you want me to speak clearly?

You talk, but you never look for me
Nor do you call me
I can't take the pressure
Talk clearly to me
You talk, but I only have you
When we are in bed
I don't know what to think
Talk clearly to me
You always with the same story
Saying that I lie to you
Thinking what play with your feelings
You want me to tell you what I feel
Mommy, the words are taken by the wind
You know that you are my baby
My black, my queen, my good thing
The Cangri shouts me when he co -took her
My cat, my flower, the light of my eyes

You talk, but you never look for me
Nor do you call me
I can't take the pressure
Talk clearly to me
You talk, but I only have you
When we are in bed
I don't know what to think
Talk clearly to me

I need you even if you are not my husband ...
Sometimes I feel that I sleep with the enemy ...
And when the night falls, I don't get it ...
And I feel alone when you are not with me ...

Hey, mommy, I am yours na 'more
I don't know why you're so attributing
I told you that I'm not going to fail you never
I am the cat that has you enchula
Hey, mommy, I am yours na 'more
I don't know why you're so attributing
I told you that I'm not going to fail you never
I am the cat that has you enchula
Hey, I know that it sometimes when you feel alone
Something like in the sky of stars
But, mommy, 'tate calmly
That although there are many in line
I do not change Chinese for bottles
And if I have failed you in something '
Don't say I don't love you
Or that I walk with other women
What I know is that I have pichao '
Is that I have 'well occupied'
Mommy cool, don't despair, look
You might also like spells, but you never look for me
Nor do you call me
I can't take the pressure
Talk clearly to me
You talk, but I only have you
When we are in bed
I don't know what to think
Talk clearly to me
You talk, but you never look for me
Nor do you call me
I can't take the pressure
Talk clearly to me
You talk, but I only have you
When we are in bed
I don't know what to think
Talk clearly to me
