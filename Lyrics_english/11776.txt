Used kisses Lyrics [Lyrics for "Used Kisses]

[Verse 1]
When you say that I forget you, it is because you have forgotten me
You ask that a bond that you have already unleashed
How does the kiss unbeat? How do you unleash a hug?
How do I delete a caress? How do your arms forget?
You know that it is impossible for me to divide in two steps
And distribute the way without separating our lips
And distribute the way without separating our lips
[Chorus]
You will love again, it's true, other arms will link you
You will live dawn, light will come into your room
I ram my memories how the junk
But no matter how try you will not forget my lips
Your kisses eternally will be used kisses

[Verse 2]
How does the kiss unbeat? Who stays loved?
More than current roads, we recorded with our hands
Because everything you take from my love already tattooed
You can never tear yourself away from what leaves you marked
If you condemn me to lose you, I condemn you to the past
And the ghost of my kiss will always live on your lips
And the ghost of my kiss will always live on your lips

[Chorus]
You will love again, it's true, other arms will link you
You will live dawn, light will come into your room
I ram my memories how the junk
But no matter how try you will not forget my lips
Your kisses eternally will be used kisses

[Chorus]
You will love again, it's true, other arms will link you
You will live dawn, light will come into your room
I ram my memories how the junk
But no matter how try you will not forget my lips
Your kisses will be eternally
