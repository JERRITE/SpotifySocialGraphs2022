Domingo (Remix) Lyrics [Letter from "Domingo (Remix)" Ft. Cosculluela, Greeicy & Rauw Alejandro]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro & Reykon]
(This is the remix)
I am Kingon the leader
E-e-e-evo Jedis (UH-YEH)
How rich we spent yesterday
I was wanting more
Today I want to look for you
For we already have some planet '
First you have to be naked
I know it's going to like you
[Pre-Caro: Greeicy]
The brightness of your eyes betrays you
Let's go to your apartment alone
Relax and enjoy me while Estemo '

[Choir: Reykon, Reykon & Greeicy]
On Sunday in your bed, with light clothes
A Sunday of desire (eat on), oh, touching the sky
A movie Sunday, next to me
After doing so ten times, let's fall asleep

[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro]
(Ra 'rauw)
Mommy, I love you all for me (wuh)
I have wanted to tell you a long time (UH)
Is that he kills me how you look at me (ey)
I stole a kiss because I couldn't resist (ah)
For you I get up to Mass
Baby, your eye 'they hypnotize me, Yeah
All to see a smile
My protagonist, novel Televisa, Yeah
Fine, it's also street
To'a the 'evil' thing that I do 'on the street, no, Yeah
She Portuguese fails
It moves it as Anitta, how good you look, oh-yyah (yah)
Fine, it's also street
To'a the 'evil' thing that I do 'on the street, no, Yeah
She Portuguese fails
It moves it as Anitta, how good you look, oh-yyah (yah)

A Sunday of desire (eat on), oh, touching the sky
A movie Sunday, next to me
After doing so ten times, let's fall asleep

[Verse 2: Reykon & Greeicy]
(I am Kingon "The leader")
Let Sunday arrive
To see that all week you and I are going to be thinking about the same
And do what you want ', if you need me call
And if you dance, give it, I follow your rhythm
I want to feel more, go crazy more
No one can control this desire now
And although Na has not passed, I want to repeat

[Choir: Rauw Alejandro, Reykon & Greeicy, Greeicy, Rauw Alejandro & Greeicy]
On Sunday in your bed, with light clothes (with light clothes)

[Verse 3: cosculluela]
Yeah, Yeah (PRR, PRR, PRR, PRR, PRR)
Imagine a Sunday of pleasure (PRR)
You and I alone in the house, bored, with nothing to do (ah)
I don't know if he has' cat or you are faithful (hahaha)
But who fucks, today we are you and I on a honeymoon, oh (rrr)
Seeing Movies, also do them '(Wuh)
A mushroom if you want Lomers' (AH)
All dark and only some candles Encendo '(hahaha)
So much wick-wicky that the bed we break
If I get Bellaco, you don't follow 'the machine (prrr)
Ponte ready, mommy, that I do not lose stamina
'TÃ¡ to' on Sunday as the Vikings (pa-pam, pa-pam)
I say in four, but it's not bingo (trra-pa-pa-pa-pa)
