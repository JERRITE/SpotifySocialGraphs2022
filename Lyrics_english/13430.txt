Look how it moves it (move; shu)

He says he is Santa, but now who sees you? (Prr; sees you)
A Friday comes out and a Judgment returns'
Fiesta addict, and

[Verse 1: Ryan Castro]
To 'the fine of week drinking until dawn (ah)
Granzaíto 'in Barrio Antioquia, I thought she was my wife
I know you sued '(Yeah)
Before 'that I was a singer
With that giant ass
You like gangsters
I gave him a diamond chain (Ajá)
I became his Nicky Jam and made him a scan
Every time we culea asks me to sing (hehe)
We started on Friday and we finished Tuesday
She is a television queen (Awoo, Awoo)
But it's a banda, an action baby
He has his ass like Riri, a bandidi (haha)
Is as good as the Valdiri
"Pon who tv" I told Siri and ended up raising the mini (Pu-Pu-Pu-Pum!)

[Verse 2: blessd]
Le-Le-Le Like Pickys, he likes strings
It remains at a party, always from Guaracha
Everyone dispatches them, never rushes
Balenciaga and Gucci is always its facade
Their buttocks are focused and then the flash goes (flash)
All those kids are from Onlyfans (Woh)
For the hair, it is perverted
And when it is in four it is a melody, ma '
