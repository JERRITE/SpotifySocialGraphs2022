GIVE HER SOUL Lyrics[Intro]
Aye, think yo' hoe different, uh
Aye think yo' hoe different, huh
Aye, think yo' hoe different, uh, aye
Aye who wanna take this shit?

[Verse 1]
Aye, think yo' hoe different, these bitches glo-digging
You put yo' trust in money, she might put her soul in it
You put yo' trust in money, she'uh probably fold quicker
Can see the pros in her, I'm tryna' see the whole [?]
I put my trust in Twat, I never needed no nigga
She workin' round the clock, she tryna' bring it home quicker
My old bitch is still on ice, it's getting cold, innit?
I might just pop back out and shе'll play her role differеnt, uh
Uh, uh, aye
[Chorus]
She like, "Twat pick up the phone, I know you got them hoes with you, nigga"
Uh, aye
She like "Twat the fuck you doing I can't leave you alone, nigga", uh
Uh, uh, aye, aye
I'm only rapping 'bout my hoes, I do a song with you, nigga
Huh, aye
I got bad hoes out here tryna' give they souls, nigga

[Verse 2]
She said some broke shit, watch how I leave you alone quicker
The label low budget, shit they got a loan, nigga
You ship it to the crib, watch how I get it gone quicker
Ain't been back to my block, I'm tryna' bring the load with me
It's lonely at the top I'm tryna' bring the bros with me
And my hoes with me, and the drink with me
Stop tryna' gas up niggas, don't you know they tank empty
You might just level up if you just play yo' role different, nigga

[Chorus]
She like, "Twat pick up the phone, I know you got them hoes with you, nigga"
Uh, aye
She like "Twat the fuck you doing I can't leave you alone, nigga", uh
Uh, uh, aye, aye
I'm only rapping 'bout my hoes, I do a song with you, nigga
Huh, aye
I got bad hoes out here tryna' give they soulYou might also likeEmbed
