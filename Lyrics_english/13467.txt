24 Hours Ago LyricsTwo four hours ago
Was twice the length when I was barely half my age
You were mine for 24 hours at a time
But I bet you guessed by now you'd hardly satisfy

Cause 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keeping on
I can't
I can't get with it (wha-oh)
I can't even get arrested (wha-ah-oh)
Counting out the days cause they all taste the same

The only thing I know
Is my chocolate-covered loophole
And the story of a shark
That meets the rock and roll fringe

Cause 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keeping on

You're gonna live
You're gonna die
You better make up all your minds
Are you gonna listen to your heartbeat
On a Saturday night

You were mine for 24 hours at a time
Don't leave me cause you love me
Woah-oh-woah-oh

I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keeping on

Cause 24 hours ago from right now
I was thinking that 24 hours ahead from right now
I'll be singing the same old
24 hours ago from right now song
To remind me to keep on keeping onEmbed
