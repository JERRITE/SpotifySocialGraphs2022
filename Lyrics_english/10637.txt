Iggady (Remix) Lyrics[Intro:]
Gang, gang, gang
Muah!
You already know
It's Track or Die

[Verse 1: Bali Baby]
Miss Brazy Biggady, what's brackin'?
I cut that bitch head off and walk away giggling (Hahahahaha)
It do not make sense to me
How you so gangster but only pop through a screen? (Off twitter)
I'm countin' up all this green (I'm countin' the money)
I fucked on her friend then I passed that bitch through the team (Through my team)
Ass so fat busting through the seam (Ass so fat)
I promise I won't miss 'cause you know I got the beam (Got the beam)
We rock that shit now she's a fiend (Yeah, she love it)
Ridin' round with the shooter call it riggady (Riggady)
There is no endin' me (There is no ending me)
Pull up to the party, clear the vicinity (Goodbye)
Get killed 'cause of stupidity
I can't trust these niggas I got a Glock gliggady
(Grra grra)
She popping it willingly (She popping it willingly)
My words is so sick giving great fucking imagery (You just see me)
Walk in his cribbady (Walk straight in)
Smoking it good like he smoking his ciggady (Yuh)
Paranormal activity (Hahaha)
I love yo bitch yeah she say I'm in her fantasy (Yeah, she love me)
[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
This gas got me smiggady (Smacked)
Hit you three times you think its a damn trilogy (A damn trilogy?)
Know these lil' bitches envy me (Uh)
When you see me in person just keep the same energy
Damn, must be kidding me
They finessed you again you 'bout sweet as some ciggady (Some candy)
Your boyfriend keep missing me (Keep missing me)
Said that he want this pussy 'cause my shit too slippery (Too slippery)
Why you keep on sneak dissing me? (Sneak dissing me)
Fuck 'round and get yo ass smoked just like hickory (Ha)

[Verse 3: Mallory Merk]
I get so high I forget to respond
You talkin' that shit I'll pull up to ya lawn (I pull up)
My savages wanna shoot up your garage
Hoes in the foreign we breakin' the law
Bank Riggady (Haha)
My shooters got cases in 10 different citiddies (Don't fuck up)
Don't get under my skinnady (Don't)
