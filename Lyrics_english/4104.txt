11 PM Lyrics [letter of "11 pm"]

[Pre-car]
Eleven at night, he still doesn't answer
A 'e the morning, there is still no answer (huh, h)
Two in the morning, he tells me that 't√° arranged (eh-eh, h)
Three in the morning, I have a proposal

[Chorus]
How to make you understand
What do you look better with me? (Tell me)
What in my car do you look better?
The room smells Christian Dior
You are very pretty to cry for him
Does not deserve to be faithful
Nor your foot-e-el, baby
How to make you understand (UH-AH)
What do you look better with me?
What in my car do you look better?
The room smells Christian Dior
You are very pretty to cry for him
Does not deserve to be faithful
Nor your skin, OH-OH-OH
[Verse]
He won't miss you, he won't think about you either
He says he is busy in more important things
The cloud that does not show the bright sun (UH)
Don't let it turn off, Yeah (No-No)
Don't let it turn off (no-no, not)

[Chorus]
How to make you understand
What do you look better with me?
What in my car do you look better?
The room smells Christian Dior
You are very beautiful to cry for him (to cry for him)
Does not deserve to be faithful (it does not deserve to be faithful)
Nor your skin, OH-OH-OH
How to make you understand
What do you look better with me?
What in my car do you look better?
The room smells Christian Dior
You are very beautiful to cry for him (to cry for him)
Does not deserve to be faithful (it does not deserve to be faithful)
Nor your skin, oh-oh-oh (no-no, not)

[Pre-car]
Eleven at night, he still doesn't answer (Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
A 'e the morning, there is still no answer (oh, no, no, no-oh)
Two in the morning, he tells me that he is willing (Baby)
Three in the morning, I have a proposal (tell me!)
