Alone and without love (woe now, Yay) Lyrics as I tell you that you will not come back
As I tell you not to return
If I have not yet been able to get you out of my life
Night after night I can't stand
I know love did not come to palpitate
Like a million carica you can give
And how to deny him
If it is stronger than me
And I'm just for kissing you, EE
And how to hide him
If it is inside me
And I don't live if we love us
Ay and Aya
As I tell my poor, poor heart, (ay yai yai already)
As I explain that I am alone, alone and without love, (ay yai yai already)
If he does not understand and only beats, beat your favor, (ay yai yai already)
How to deceive it if it is damage
That the reason gets drunk

(ay yai yai already)

And how to deny him
If it is stronger than me
And I'm just for kissing you, (EE)
And how to hide him
If it is inside me
And I don't live if we love us
Ay yai yai already

As I tell my poor, poor heart, (ay yai yai already)
As I explain that I am alone, alone and without love, (ay yai yai already)
If he does not understand and only beats, beat your favor, (ay yai yai already)
How to deceive it if it is damage
That the reason gets drunk

I do not live if you are as I solve
I don't know what I feel over, what I observe
You left me alone deserted, with what
In a tears patch I wrap myself
My heart you stop
I call you and you don't call me
That not time what I have to do
For me to have you again in my bed
I love you and you not
I tell you that you are not
Yours do weeks
And the weeks are made by me
You Might Also Likela Reason (Ooo)
That the reason gets drunk (ooo)

I wanted it so much
I who worshiped her so much
He left and left me alone
He turned his back on me
Even if my mistake was
Not asking you forgive
Now as I say
To my heart
That left to not return
And that hurts, and it hurts (EEI)

Ay yai yai yai
Ayai Yai Yai
Ayai Yai Yai
Ayai Yai YaMed
