Of quiet Lyrics [letter of "of quiet"]

[Saying: Danny Romero]
What a beautiful face
Oh what a beautiful face
He knocked on my door without me looking for her
And spilled to the cubata
Oh what a beautiful face

[Verse 1: Danny Romero]
Hi how are things?
I did not expect you for this place
With his tanguita bikini
More curves than Anitta
Let's go water to take off the drought
And now that
Only fish can hear us
And that people don't look at us
Let it put you in a situation
[Chorus: Danny Romero]
I propose a romantic evening
Lunatic medium
You will not miss you
Na de na
Because I have the tactics and I have chemistry
Pa turning toa crazy
Doing it at sea

Of quiet, I invite you
To a couple of mojitos
Under the Solecito
Of quiet, I invite you
To a couple of mojitos
Under the Baby Solecito

[Verse 2: Danny Romero & Lérica]
You will not miss Na, background Alejandro Sanz
Three bottles of champagne
Let's get rid of
And if the thing goes more, kill curiosity
And if we do indecent
I put you to Romeo Santos

And if the night gets cold, I would heat you
And without hesitation Mami, in your tsunami I would drown me
And if it gets cold, I would heat you
For when you wake up, you want with me another day
You Might Also Like [Choir: Lérica]
I propose a romantic evening
Lunatic medium
You will not miss you
Na de na
Because I have the tactics and I have chemistry
Pa turning toa crazy
Doing it at sea

Of quiet, I invite you
To a couple of mojitos
Under the Solecito
Of quiet, I invite you
To a couple of mojitos
Under the Baby Solecito

[Verse 3: Lérica]
And let me tell you that you will not forget what we will do tonight
Either in the sand, in bed or car
Everything will be in detail you will not have any reproach
And let me tell you that I was planning since you met me
That I sing to you, I dance, I tell you a joke
You smiled, you smiled
