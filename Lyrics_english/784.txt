Let yourself want Lyrics [letter of "Let yourself love" ft. Trapical Minds]

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra & Yera]
Your friends already told me that you feel like (that's right)
And I am keeping you a space in my bed (normal)
My mom was telling me to take care (Yeah-eh)
And I am sure that you turned on the flame

[Chorus: Yera, Sebastián Yatra & Lalo Ebratt]
Oh, let yourself love
I want to enter your skin
If your dad asks, tell him that you are mine too (no)
The one who doesn't drown
Kisses also steal
To me that condemn me, that the moment is now
[Post-Coro: Lalo Ebratt & Sebastián Yatra]
I see you everywhere, I even see you in the rumba
Yesterday I caught you at the gym
I'm about that jean
I see you everywhere, you kidnapped my dreams
I can't stand one more day if I don't have you (I can't stand)

[Verse 1: YERA & LALO EBRATT]
(Yera Music)
And if you dance 'it is because you have' alcohol (OH-OH-OH)
How is your cute body seen when it puts you 'in the sun
I look at your golden color and your linda face, chocolate
Oh, my blessed, what a beautiful little mouth, what flow
I want to be your candy
It is not a line in the club
Sizá ', see that now' well Melo '
Without going to the gym your buttocks' almost touch your hair (your hair)
I like you are cookies and cream
You and I made 'a Dreamteam
Voamo ', Pajarito Pin Pin
You gave me Knockout in the ring
Bum!

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Yera]
Oh, let yourself love
I want to enter your skin
If your dad asks, tell him that you are mine too
The one who doesn't drown
Kisses also steal
To me that condemn me, that the moment is now

(Yeah-eh, Yeah)
Feel me
You know me, Like Miami He's Lovely
You know me, your kiss' in me, because
Mommy, now I will say
Let yourself be loved, that does not hurt
Mama, Gomola bear in bed
Mama, pass the movie, tnt, t and me
If they ask you, Mommy: "Wasn't Me"
My house has it from Airbnb

[Verse 3: Yera, Sebastián Yatra, Lalo Ebratt, Yra & Sebastián Yatra]
I call you at 4 and 20, feel how my flow
From me give oil, so a pump
You and I, put 'in a rumba
You and I, we are helm and pumba
Siquiriquida, so good that I like you, Yeh
Siquiriquida, so good, knows 'that you are' good

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Yera]
Oh, let yourself love
I want to enter your skin
If your dad asks, tell him that you are mine too
The one who doesn't drown
Kisses also steal
To me that condemn me, that the moment is now
[Post-Coro: Lalo Ebratt & Sebastián Yatra]
I see you everywhere, I even see you in the rumba
Yesterday I caught you at the gym
I'm about that jean
I see you everywhere, you kidnapped my dreams
I can't stand one more day if I don't have you (I can't stand)

Your friends already told me you want (Yera Music)
L-a-l-o
And I am keeping you a space in my bed
Mangoe
My mom was telling me to make me go
Raise the levels
And I am sure that you turned on the flame (Yeah-eh, Yeah-eh)
Yatra, Yatra1embed
