Lyricsy confidant heart that you think you free me and leave me
In full cataclysm in the city
It must be that this story is not finished in you

That is responsible for breaking into pieces
Destroy in three seconds
That oath that vanishes just behind you

There is no bigger power woman
That ourselves
Confident heart
Heart you don't lie
Heart do not let go
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart that you dare
HEART GIVE ME FORCES
Boom boom weo!

And this conclusion that opens my eyes well
NOBODY MORE THAN THE TIME
Can leave with your spell
Turn around everything here is better

And how chance my friends always
You completely gave up your debate
You see it that survives without you

There is no bigger power woman
That ourselves

Confident heart
Heart you don't lie
Heart do not let go
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart that you dare
HEART GIVE ME FORCES
Boom boom weo!
You might also like that the one who laughs
The latest laugh better
Go and look for another way
That you are nothing here

There is no bigger power woman
That ourselves

Confident heart
Heart you don't lie
Heart do not let go
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart that you dare
HEART GIVE ME FORCES
Boom boom weo!

There is no bigger power woman
That ourselves

Confident heart
Heart you don't lie
Heart do not let go
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart that you dare
HEART GIVE ME FORCES
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart you don't lie
Heart do not let go
Boom boom weo!
Confident heart
Heart that you dare
HEART GIVE ME FORCES
Boom boom weo! Embed
