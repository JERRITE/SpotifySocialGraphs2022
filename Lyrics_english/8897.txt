Happenings Ten Years Time Ago Lyrics[Verse 1]
Meeting people along my way
Seemingly, I've known one day
Familiarity of things
That my dreaming always brings

[Chorus]
Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time
[Alternate Verse]
Walking in the room, I see
Things that mean a lot to me
Why they do, I never know
Memories don't strike me so
Memories don't strike me so

[Verse 2]
It seems to me I've been here before
The sounds I heard and the sights I saw
Was it real, was it in my dreams?
I need to know what it all means

[Guitar Solo]
(Pop group, are ya?)
(I'll bet you're making money)
(Why you lot wear long hair?)
(Bet you're appearing in a club, are ya?)
(Singing every night there on stage...)

[Chorus]
Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of timeYou might also likeEmbed
