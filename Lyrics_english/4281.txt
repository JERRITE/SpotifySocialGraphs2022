[Intro: Lenny Tavárez, Dalex, Sech & Nicky Jam]
The Avengers
Since we were 'in the high (high)
You wrote my name in your notebook (notebook; Yeih)
I think about you when I'm high
And now picheas pa 'eating us (vamo' a seeno ')
Give me a little while and more na '(more na')
Then if you want I don't write you more na '(more na')
I look like Google looking for you
I want to make a series that is called "To'a the night giving you", Baby
[Pre-car: Dalex]
Tell me if you walk with that fool or go alone (UH-YEH)
I in the Mercedes and he has you in the Corolla
If one day of these, Baby, he neglects you
I'm going to make you mine

[Chorus: Dalex & Nicky Jam]
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate' (uh-yeh)
If you forgot, I remind you (UH-YEH)
As I did it, when it came to you, '
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate'
If you forgot, I remind you
As I did it, when it came to you, '

[Verse 1: sech]
I tell you, when, time, where and happens
Pay the people of Waze pa 'to delete the location from my house
I am selling noviecito, grilled cuer
And if my plan fails, tomorrow returns and passes (pass)
Remember when I did '
In the car, in the kitchen, this series does not end (no, no, no)
Baby, I always had you on top (no)
Think of a number, you already imagine

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
He tells me 'to leave, he asks me' to stay
You always play, with you you can't
Until you climb me 'on top, yeh, I put discipline, Yeh
I never drop it, it always asks me another '(another sees')
Another I see it calling me (calling me)
Don't forget how I treated her (how I treated her)
That the plans' everyone changed them (I changed them, huh)
And her boyfriend, now she turned her ex (she turned her ex)

Eh, tomorrow let me know if I delay you '(it takes you')
To teach you how a pussy devours (Yahoo!)
A nine six back ', you know how e', in a one hour
Shorty (Yah), I know your 'problem' with the 'jumper
You don't fit the bumper, I train you that booty (booty)
Say you go with your friends alone
That in my bed there is a party (Party)

[Chorus: Justin Quiles & Sech]
Oh, Justin Quiles, Mommy
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate'

When he did it-be-be, as he came to you, '
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate'
If you forgot, I remind you
As I did it, when it came to you, '

[Verse 4: Justin Quiles]
What was it, gave you Alzheimer's?
Did you forget the time I ate you in the Driveway?
Breakfast, dinner, the cornstarch beat you (-Cena)
And now he tells him that I was not on the scene (-Cena)
To stop being getting Feka
If I did it inside 'e La disco (-teca)
By facetime I made you 'make face' and you touched you '
[Verse 5: feid]
Di-di-dime when we take 'the Old Fashion
Put me a capture
That we put your boyfriend 'Los Cacho' (Cacho ')
I want to repeat the dose
You who no and I do, another in the jacuzzi
Soft, that your cat can no longer see us
To eat, we always have to hide, Yeh
What a chimba, as in school
Mommy, if I call you is to be able to do it

[Chorus: Dalex & Nicky Jam]
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate' (uh-yeh)
If you forgot, I remind you (UH-YEH)
As I did it, when it came to you, '
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate'
If I forgot to you, I remind you
As I did it, when it came to you, '

[Verse 6: Rafa Pabön]
(Rafa Pabön)
Vamo 'to repeat it, I wish you and you don't have to say it
Tell me, if you want to feel it (Yeh)
E 'not to hear it as to live it
If you upload it ', mommy, you have to decrease it
On top of it, like the College remember (Yeh)
I wanted to picharle and from the park I took it out (I took it out)
To 'his trick' I already wrote them down (I scored)
And his cat was removed

[Verse 7: Dalex, Sech]
In the bed he was cool (Guayó)
Your 'favorite' pose who knows them is me
I was a sniper in your body, the one that never failed
He doesn't have to accept it, but I know it was me (I was me)
I went (baby)

[Pre-car: Dalex]
Tell me if you walk with that fool or go alone (UH-YEH)
I in the Mercedes and he has you in the Corolla
If one day of this, 'Baby, he neglects you
I'm going to make you mine

[Chorus: Dalex & Nicky Jam]
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate' (uh-yeh)
If you forgot, I remind you (UH-YEH)
As I did it, when it came to you, '
Tell me when I saw 'a seeno' pa 'eate'
If you forgot, I remind you
As I did it-be, when it came to you, '-ia'embed
