Caramel lyrics [lyrics of "caramel"]

[Verse 1]
Basic animal instinct #Iceptick #NiceBitch
B.2.O.B.A, Boulbi, South Beach
The money is saved, the sums are colossal
Black horses in German engine, my rage is colonial
We'll get you tickets, don't make the beautiful
I have fresh, mula, caramel
I'm in I am in the air you are in the traffic jams
The game is on my Caliphaon cock
You have a checkered wallet but you have nothing to Dame
I am more dangerous than an armed camera, than a Kaméhamé
92i, Lunatic you can do anything better
I'm from Niro in Heat except that in the end I take without the latemeu
[Chorus]
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
Caramel
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
Caramel

[Verse 2]
I had a dream, a lot of radius #koppmartinlutherking
You have it in your pe-cli, I have it in my parking lot
Without caramel I crazy what? I'm at the helm, I'm guilty
Do you let go of your number or what? Eh ?! Do you want to fuck or not?
Ma-Mafé, tiéboudiene more
Little Haiti I am mango
Jack tears on the ground for my dead society
Their heart beats in my ceals-mors
D.E.M.O.N, I live at night, I have that brothers I have no friends
Brazza Soldier 92i, Happy-Malureux I think of him, I think of him
I think of Daouda, Harouna, I think of Will
In the streets of 92 Izi, music thoroughly I think of Kill

[Chorus]
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
Caramel
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
Caramel

O.G Kush, I take the Cohiba
I'm number one, first in the class so I don't copy
Big checks despite school failure
To go up to the seventh heaven should I kiss an air hotpie?
Or two... ? Or three?! You are love, glory & beauty
I'm hate, victory & anger
I'm all the old ones, rap was not better before
I don't care about a magnum at my table I love it better in my glove box
Beh competition! "Booba killed me" they say, dying
Kidney stroke is legendary, your baby mama is aware
You are like Kenny of South Park, each episode you will die
I like the preliminaries, I get the scuffles

[Chorus]
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
Caramel
It's not hallal, all that is not hallal
I have to do biff, mula, caramel
