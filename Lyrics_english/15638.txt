It doesn't matter if the sun dies lyricsfue very little time 
 We both want love 
 We never knew it was 
 What I separate. No 
 Who blames? 
 Have you been t or me? 
 Or someone who is detrs? 
 It doesn't matter if the sun dies 
 I always be thinking about you 
 If the moon cries for love 
 I cry with her for you 
 I have nothing left but to remember 
 Photographs I can't hear 
 Only in your letters I see 
 Some illusion 
 That for bad wish 
 It never fulfilled 
 It doesn't matter if the sun dies 
 I always be thinking about you 
 If the moon cries for your love 
 I cry with her for you 
 Thinking of you 
 Thinking of you
