TranslationsРусскийMan of My Word Lyrics[Intro: Lil Durk]
You don't know what it took
(IRoccOnTheBeat)
(Nile, I hear you)
(You made this shit, Pharaoh)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
How she acting funny? I bought her her titties
Nigga she be fuckin' ain't none of my business
Upping my quota, that's a part of my Fendi
Don't matter where I'm at, bitch, I'm known for the trenches
We the first niggas put drums in the city
We robbed the niggas, put drugs in the city
Fuck where you from 'cause I know that you with it
Check on his ass, I'ma handle my business
Trust you enough to fuck you more than once
And you gotta be a killer just to hang with us
If you talkin' 'bout murders, there's no hangin' up
Run up on 'em, BOW, ain't no onе-on-one
I got the money, so who I'm runnin' from?
I got a lawyеr that cost a honey bun
Before I buy pussy, I'll buy a hundred guns
Judge told me nigga died with my gun
2010 Reese said Ralph Lauren
Died close, feel like he died in my arms
Reinstated, they denied my bond
A nigga play with Smurk, he not that smart
Sucked it twice and I'm still not hard
Niggas cry out loud when they gettin' shot
That nigga word don't stand on my block
Fuck what you heard, I'm the man of my block
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Stop playin', bitch, I'm Smurk
Bitch get naked, gotta put on my merch
I got your Uber, I kept my word
She freak, actin' like she a nerd
No shirt when I'm off this Perc'
They slide every time we heard
Lost bro, I know it hurt
We gon' catch 'em first

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah, we runnin' game on them, boy gotta sit out
After I hit, tell Amir, "Make her get out"
Hundred mil come and I still ain't gon' chill out
I'm really down, I'ma show how I'm get down
Hard on the bitch, man, I should've been pimpin'
Hard in these streets, the majority with me
You can't be serious, you gotta be kiddin' me
I'm really laughin', these lil' niggas temptin' me
I get offended when niggas say, "Tap in"
I bought lil' bro 'nem Celine just to trap in
I got more clothes in my closet than Saks Fifth
I watched JB make a deuce do a backflip
I know you really don't know, you just act hip
I done took off for real, now how that feel?
Bro ain't never gon' change, I know that's real
Just run outta here, straight to the backfield
I sleep good every night, now I'm happy
"How you go where you go?" I'm a trapper for real
"How you know what you know?" I adapted for real
We too rich with the feds, we put shit in the mail
My lifestyle expensive, this shit high as hell
Lil' bro tryna score, so I gave him a layup
I gotta go somewhere, no I can't lay up
Bitch, stop playin', you better not tell
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Stop playin', bitch, I'm Smurk
Bitch get naked, gotta put on my merch
I got your Uber, I kept my word
She freak, actin' like she a nerd
No shirt when I'm off this Perc'
They slide every time we heard
Lost bro, I know it hurt
We gon' catch 'em first4Embed
