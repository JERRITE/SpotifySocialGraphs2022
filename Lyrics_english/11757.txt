Do-Wah-Doo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody thinks that girl's so fine
Everybody's like "I'll make her mine!"
Everyone thinks she's a bit of all right but I think that she's not so nice
Every guy's looking in her eyes
Every guy's checking out her thigh
Everyone thinks that girls a lady - but I don't
I think that girl's shady

[Chorus]
I'll just read a book instead
I don't care if we're just friends
I can hang out with myself
I'm old enough now to pretend
I'll just read a book instead
I know that you think she's best
I don't even think she cares
I don't know what you see
There's nothing there
[Bridge]
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum
Bam ba dum Ba dum Ba dum Ba dum

But I think she's a bitch

[Chorus]
I'll just read a book instead
I don't care if we're just friends
I can hang out with myself
I'm old enough now to pretend
I'll just read a book instead
I know that you think she's best
I don't even think she cares
I don't know what you see
There's nothing there
