Chanel Bag (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: KillBunk]
GeeHues, you did this one
Yeezo beats
Told that lil' bitch stop trippin', we gon' get the bag

[Chorus: KillBunk]
Chanel on my bag, she like livin' fast
She wanna fuck with me 'cause we gettin' cash
I hit that bitch raw, I did that and I pass
I did not learn shit in that motherfuckin' class
Scratch, I pull that bitch like a bass
Racks, I'm tryna get all of that
Cash, shawty she wanna move fast
Told that lil' bitch stop trippin', we gon' get the bag
Chanel on my bag, she like livin' fast
She wanna fuck with me, 'cause we gettin' cash
I hit that bitch raw, I did that and I pass
I did not learn shit in that motherfuckin' class
Scratch, I pull that bitch like a bass
Racks, I'm tryna get all of that
Cash, shawty she wanna move fast
Told that lil' bitch stop trippin', we gon' get the bag (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1: Scorey]
Thеy call me, I touch then this trench is a Glock party, that's whеre all of my mans lit
Used to sleep in detentions then turn to a Rockstar, look what all of these bands did
Bro, she stay with extensions incase 'fore an opp try to get put on a canvas
I get money then all of these bitches just stockpile, I don't take it for granted
I'm the same nigga that came up on cools with Manny, now I might be at the Grammys
Test your luck if you see me, got G27 or Wesson, it's all in my fanny
He act dumb on the set, we gon' teach him a lesson, my niggas be steppin', on stampede
He was runnin' his mouth so we had to come check him, he usin' his legs like an athlete
My lil' bitch want Chanel then I got her
From a block with some felons, they're monsters
Brand new .40 got shells for a robber
I'm a dog, I don't tell her or call her
Told that bitch I ain't doin' no back and forth
Come and sit on this wood like a rocker
My new silencer don't really make a noise, you could say that I shoot a lil' awkward

[Chorus: KillBunk]
Chanel on my bag, she like livin' fast
She wanna fuck with me 'cause we gettin' cash
I hit that bitch raw, I did that and I pass
I did not learn shit in that motherfuckin' class
Scratch, I pull that bitch like a bass
Racks, I'm tryna get all of that
Cash, shawty she wanna move fast
Told that lil' bitch stop trippin', we gon' get the bag
Chanel on my bag, she like livin' fast
She wanna fuck with me, 'cause we gettin' cash
I hit that bitch raw, I did that and I pass
I did not learn shit in that motherfuckin' class
Scratch, I pull that bitch like a bass
Racks, I'm tryna get all of that
Cash, shawty she wanna move fast
Told that lil' bitch stop trippin', we gon' get the bag
