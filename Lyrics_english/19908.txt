Punk star
Yeah
Ooh, B-Bighead on the beat
Can't afford to fall in love with you
Not today, girl
Tomorrow isn't promised for you either
I can't be caught with the same girl

[Chorus: Mackned]
Can't afford to fall in love with you
Not today, girl
Tomorrow isn't promised for you either
I can't be caught with the same girl (The same girl)
Look at how far I've come on my own
I don't think I needed you ever (You ever)
Missed calls, hundred texts in my phone
They say life is a bitch, and I miss her (And I miss her)
Lost friends, they say life is a movie
No, no, baby, mine is a picture
(A picture, yeah, a picture)
Yeah, yeah, they say mine is a picture
[Verse 1: Mackned]
I don't wanna spend this night alone
Withdrawn from your lovin', I need you
Bighead on the beat, I can never lose
Gucci punk-star, yeah, Gucci shoes still danglin' on the roof

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
They say life is a bitch and I miss her
Heart cold, cold heart all winter
Goth boy, goth angel sinner
Take a picture, take a picture
Goth boy, goth angel sinner
Goth boy, goth angel sinner
Take a picture
Heart cold, cold heart all winter
GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Mackned]
Can't afford to fall in love with you
Not today, girl
Tomorrow isn't promised for you either

Look at how far I've come on my own
I don't think I needed you ever (You ever)
Missed calls, hundred texts in my phone
They say life is a bitch, and I miss her (And I miss her)
Lost friends, they say life is a movie
No, no, baby, mine is a picture

Goth boy, goth angel sinner
Goth boy, quick, take me a picture
Take me a picture
Takin' off in a beamer
You can hear pain if you listen close
Baby, it's a shame that we did that dope
Baby, it's a shame that we did not know
It's a shame that we could not cope
It's a shame that we could not cope
It's a shame that we did that dope
It's a shame that we did not know
It's a shame that we did not know

[Chorus: Mackned]
Can't afford to fall in love with you
Not today, girl
Tomorrow isn't promised for you either

They say life is a bitch, and I miss her (And I miss her)

[Verse 3: Lil Tracy]
Yeah
They took my cousin's life away
I wish we could trade
Don't know if you're in heaven or hell now
Can't tell a opp from a friend now
Pull up to the club bring my Glock in now
No phone, don't try to call me
Yeah, too busy ballin'
Fuck the speed limit, we go hella fast
Yeah, woah, yeah, have fun walkin'

[Chorus: Mackned]
Can't afford to fall in love with you
Not today, girl
Tomorrow isn't promised for you either
I can't be caught with the same girl (The same girl)
Look at how far I've come on my own
I don't think I needed you ever (You ever)
Missed calls, hundred texts in my phone
They say life is a bitch, and I miss her (And I miss her)
Lost friends, they say life is a movie
No, no, baby, mine is a picture
(A picture, yeah, a picture)
Yeah, yeah, they say mine is a picture11Embed
