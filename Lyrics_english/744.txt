You never walk it, you always fight
I imagine that you have 'idea that
[Chorus: Jon Z, Jon Z & Baby Rasta, Baby Rast
She is going to hit you, you don't get it to janguear (you don't get it to janguear)
She will deny it to you, because you are going to fight her (you are going to fight her)
She is going to hit you, you don't get it to janguear (you don't get it to janguear)
She will deny it to you, because you are going to fight her (you are going to fight her)
She is going to hit you, you don't get it to Janguear (Oah; Yi-Yi)

[Verse 1: ele to the domain]
I found her, he gave me complaint '
He asked me for advice, I gave it to his ear
He liked that, tickled him
I gave him with the torque, because you take away
Doll mouth, and you don't attend it
I jump the cuica, that seeing does not come
'After you don't take it out, and you don't let out
You have it to clean, and your children give birth

[Bridge: Ele to the domain]
She is not your slave, nor belong to you
To 'days looking for me, with me dawns
I give him to ’, a couple of months ago
You don't let them talk, never express
I was already bored, already your routine
You don't care, less crazy pina
Not even cooks you, lava, or pick up
Pick up your things, and Pa'l Cage (Pa'l Cajo; the nigga domain)

[Verse 2: Noriel]
She is going to hit them, because you do not attend it, it is already hated, ah
She is going to deceive you because you cheated on her and she is mordo, ah
You do it at night when she tells you Dizque is sleeping
But it really doesn't lie to you
Because she leaves with me, but always and 'by day, ah
Bastard
But I came to come as it was not coming for a long time
He felt ugly because nobody attended her
Is looking for her to leave and give her her parti'a, ah
You deserved the horns, you had it empty
With monotony, she was cold
Remove Aburri'a, dawn
He asked me, he told me that she is no longer yours, that she is now mine

[Pre-Caro: Baby Rasta]

She is going to hit you, you don't get it to Janguear (Oah; Yi-Yi)
