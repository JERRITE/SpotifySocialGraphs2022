[Intro: Zone people, Wisin]
Brr!
Chyno Miranda
Zone people
W, I need to be with you
(He says)

[Verse 1: Chyno Miranda, Alexander Delgado]
I can lose everything and that my heart fails me (Brr!)
But that your love never lacks, oh
With you everything is good even if the moment is the worst
Baby that your love never misses, oh (Randy Malcolm)
[Pre-Caro: Randy Malcolm, Alexander Delgado]
Baby give me a little (Brr!)
Of your sweet lips
That time is short
Give it to me please
Let's escape with this crazy love
Let's stop time

[Choir: Chyno Miranda, Alexander Delgado, Randy Malcolm]
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love (Chyno)
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love
(Tell it Chyno)

[Verse 2: Chyno Miranda, Alexander Delgado]
You have what makes me happy
You have what it falls in love
You are perfect for me (Brr!)
I think of you at all hours
I choose you every second
If I take my hand, I feel very good
You are the one who relaxes me and takes away the stress
Without you my world was the other way around, and I

Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love (I could ')

[Verse 3: wisin]
There comes, leave it that nobody stops it
When she touches my time she stops
The body has it, a beautiful face has it
It does not leave the gym, she alone remains
I go crazy, that perfume favors you
When he kisses me, it strengthens me
Looks at me to start
It seems that this passion grows
All my respects you deserve it (Let's Go Randy)

[Pre-Caro: Randy Malcolm, Alexander Delgado, Wisin]
Baby give me a little
Of your sweet lips
That time is short
Please give it to me (Brr!)
We are going to escape with this love of crazy people (zone people)
Let's stop time
[Choir: Chyno Miranda, Alexander Delgado, Wisin]
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love (Chyno)
Love don't go (don't go)
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love (Yeh, Chyno)
Love, do not go
Stay with me
Give me your light
Baby give me your love
