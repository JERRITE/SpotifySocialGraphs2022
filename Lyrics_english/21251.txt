Full of Regret Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta do a little bit of reminiscing
On the days that just gone by
They say don't look back but I take things in stride
Everybody wanna minimize
They want to change what can't be undone
I can see it's a recipe that always leads to just no fun

Haven't slipped that time to take you back
I got a few regrets of my own
She had a diamond eye, beauty all her own
Where are you now girl
You know you got that special place I always see you
When love spits in my face
[Chorus 1]
Regrets, I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery

[Verse 2]
It's a little bit of luck but whole a lot of hard work takes a toll
Most people don't know when they walk in
How they get what's in store
I thought I'd given up and settled on the blues
But I'd always think of her when I didn't know what to do

It'll be my burden to track when it got hot
When she walked on, I didn't know what I'd just lost
Maybe she's out there and thinking just like me
What if, what would have happened, what could have been

[Chorus 1]
Regrets, I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery

[Chorus 2]
Regrets, I've had mine
Lonely times and too many wasted nights
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery
You might also like[Bridge]
Regrets, I've had mine
Regrets, I've had mine

Sometimes when I think back
I wonder where it was that I lost track
And I think of you
Ha ha baby who knew, who knew
She's out there, she's somewhere
I'm losing my head again
She's always haunting me
I'm going out of my head

[Chorus 1]
Regrets, I've had mine
Lonely nights and a whole lot of wasted time
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery

[Chorus 2]
Regrets, I've had mine
Lonely times and too many wasted nights
If you see her won't you tell her for me
It's better this way to avoid our misery

[Outro]
I'm full of regret
I'm full of regret
I'm full of regret
I'm full of regretEmbed
