Donâ€™t Start Me Lyrics[Intro]
Rah, ooh
Bitch you shouldn't have started me
Okay, bitch you shouldn't have started me
Rifle clap you faster then your heartbeat

[Verse]
I'll put that metal on a bitch just like a horseshoe
Go anywhere and step just like a horse do
Your bitch a bopper, when you at work I'm the one she give your fuckin' car to
Plus I hold your daughter, your son, and your lil boy too
I'm dumb, I'll sit on your couch and roll a blunt
I'll cut on your TV and Sanford & Son
Your lil boy doin' all that whining, bitch I'm finna slap your son
'Cause that's the only way your pussy ass gon' get your gun
You ain't gutter, I don't know who the fuck done put that in your head
I don't know who the fuck done told you Whop Bezzy was scared
If I can't catch your ass slippin', I'll go and get your mama head
Glock with the extension clip long as a baby leg
I'm gon' do you down bad, it's over with
Shoot you in your ribs and make your fuckin' shoulder twist
Got so many firearms, a nigga shoulder-less
He ain't wanna run until he heard that fucking cutter spit
My girl diving behind me, plus she'll cut a bitch
I'm slicker than some butter bitch
I'll cuff anything but a bitch
I'll trust anything but a snitch
This ain't no kiddy pool, this water deeper than a bitch
You know I'm with that fuck a nigga bitch
She ain't even brush her teeth but tryna suck a nigga dick
Your pussy ass still talkin' shit?
I still got on your slippers, playin' your game bitch
I always hug your baby mama, bitch I never kiss
I could've said your name but I don't want 'em in my mix
Like a Smith & Wesson, bitch you should've took a dick
All that shit you doing, boy u acting like a ho
Whats the point of you cuffin' when you know that I can hit?
I'm still with the shits, you never was, get off my dick
Your mama come in my yard, shit I'm gon' crack her with a stick
I'm Wrecking Crew Whop Bezzy, known to flash on a bitch
You ever take some' from me, I'm gon' take my fuckin' lick
I ain't have no arms to fight, bitch I'll kick
Ruger my favorite firearm, this bitch ain't got no kick
I can see it in my dreams, how I'ma walk down and hit
When I aim it I don't miss, how you gangster and be walkin' with a twist?
Carbon hold a hundred, make me shoot a flick
This bitch done blast and flash like a pic
I'm really with the shits, ooh I'm really with the shits
Bitch I'll bat you in your shit, duhYou might also like1Embed
