Iâ€™m Not Okay (I Promise) Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?
[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
[Guitar Solo]

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now!

[Bridge]
But I'm okay, I'm okay!
I'm okay now, "I'm okay now," but you really need to
Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth!
I mean this, I'm okay! "Trust me..."

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay, well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay!
I'm not okay
I'm not okay...111Embed
