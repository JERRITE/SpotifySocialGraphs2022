Bodybag Lyrics[Hook: Lil Lotus]
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me now, what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me now, what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back

[Verse 1: Lil Lotus]
All my life all I do is I try and I fall
I just wish it was from somewhere high
But I'll stay inside if you want me to
Yeah, stay inside if you want me to
But when you come around baby, please hold me down
I know I make mistakes, pick me up off the ground
Should've stayed inside like you told me to
Should've stayed inside like you told me to
I can't resist, yuh, blood on my wrists, yuh
Hands 'round my neck, yuh, tats on my chest, yuh
I can't resist, yuh, blood on my wrists, yuh
Hands 'round my neck, yuh, tats on my chest, yuh
I can't resist, yuh, blood on my wrists, yuh
Hands 'round my neck, yuh, tats on my chest, yuh
I can't resist, yuh, blood on my wrists, yuh
Hands 'round my neck, yuh, tats on my chest, yuh

Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me, now what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me, now what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
Pulled up to your house in a Bentley (Skrrt)
I didn't say a word but you felt me
I should've told you all my bad dreams
We were just kids on the rooftops
Bumping GBC till they called the cops
We were smoking dope in your bedroom
You let me write my name all on your shoes
And if I really had you, I would take you back
But you want me in a bodybag
And I guess it's better off like that

[Hook: Lil Lotus]
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me, now what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me, now what's up with that?
Told me I was better in a bodybag
Gave me all your heart and now you need it back
Pull up to your house, now I'm tongue tied
Said that you don't love me, now what's up with that?

The pain that breaks my heart each day
I'm not okay
Sunlight shining through my window
Lets me know that I'm still alive
But why did I ever let you inside my heart?
I'm such a fool
Paint my face in shades of blood and grey...7Embed
