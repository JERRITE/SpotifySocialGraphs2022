Kiss me Lyrics ["Besame" letter]]

[Intro: bhavi]
Huh, touch, yes

[Chorus: bhavi]
Kissa-Bésame, my love (huh, touch, yes)
I don't know how long I give (huh, touch, yes)
Let's take advantage of today because it is today (huh, touch, yes)
Today because it is today
[Verse 1: bhavi]
Baby, I have a dehydrated soul
You don't see me well, the covered look (no)
Always fighting for some pavada (yesempre)
When I kiss you I don't receive anything (I know)
I know that life is not a fairy tale '(what?)
Nor nightmares, the wings weigh (I don't trust)
I no longer trust any word (ah), the "hugging" (abracadabra)
When he leaves the discot 'uses my shelter arm, he (-brigo)
Susi does not see me as a friend, hey, her boyfriend yes, of enemy, he
Volume-to forget (UH), the mirror says "Convidá" (OH-OH)
Below from the morning (huh), life is not healthy (woh)
Hoping to happen to me as phase (Yeah)
Time is looking for a result '
And I put a substance to 'uncontrolled'
To 'unfortunate, I immersed my face and almost drowned
And then I told myself that this was not the way
But I came back, how do everyone, well, almost all
It is difficult to navigate when you are inside the mud
Difficult to trust, shaking your hand, they grab your elbow and— (huh, touch, yes)

[Chorus: bhavi]
Kissa-Bésame, my love (huh, touch, yes; ah-ah-ah)
I don't know how long I give (huh, touch, yes; ah-ah-ah)
Let's take advantage of today because it is today (huh, touch, yes)
Today because it is today

I know, baby, I failed you
That I fell, I got up
I pursued him and I didn't stop
I got it and now they see me
What do you expect from me? If my half gave you
And just enmity you gave me
After giving you what you once asked
I'm not sad, I know you don't go as much as you said
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Girl, today only I know what I happened
How I Crowned with Sole My Faith
And now they don't see, how they change, huh
I don't expect anyone from anyone, Yeah-Yeah
And ready, now she left me in seen
If you think I don't resist
I can endure until tomorrow
If I know that tonight he will talk to me and ready
Baby, I know I'm ready
Not like everything 'that' guys
Yeh-eh-eh-eh (huh, touch, yes)

[Chorus: Bhavi & Seven Kayne, both]
Kissa-Bésame, my love (uh-ah-ah; eh, touch, yes), yeah
I don't know how long I give (uh-ah-ah; I do)
Let's take advantage of today because it is today (UH-AH-AH; today)
Today because it's today (I don't know how long I have)
