[Pre-car: Jon Z, Ñengo]
Time will tell you (Baby)
You are not going to forget me
Deep feelings
That the heart cannot be erased
Time will tell you, you will not forget me
They say one nail takes another
Baby that only rhyme
[Chorus: Jon Z & Ñengo Flow, ñnego Flow]
No matter how much you are with him
You will never forget me
No matter how much you are with him
You will always think about me
When you fuck with him and he doesn't come to you
You will want to come back, you will want to come back
Where my

[Verse 1: Ñengo]
Wet kisses pa 'ti
It arrives without Panty to ‘Impe Me
Pa 'give you classes in my jail
Secret is the base, let's go from here
ENROLA WHAT I WANT TO Light
The buttocks and the hot pant want to see you
Take that booty and break it to sticks
Like the timbales of the great Tito Puentes
Tell him not invent, if he does not know death
That I am with children's pal
That can go out to hunt him in front
Because you are mine and you know it
Shoot, hijueputa, which have me serious
Take for wash
What do you shout my name when I key you
I fuck your mind since I touched
That down there Baby, your mind blocked
Diva picket, the dodge bullets
I exchange your toto and milk for saliva
The legs up, I'm going on top
Always enchumba the bed when the weather changed

Time will tell you, you will not forget me
Deep feelings
That the heart cannot be erased
Time will tell you, you will not forget me
They say one nail takes another
Baby that only rhyme

[Choir: Ñengo Flow, Jon Z & Ñengo Flow]
No matter how much you are with him
You will never forget me
No matter how much you are with him
You will always think about me
When you fuck with him and he doesn't come to you
You will want to come back, you will want to come back
Where my

[Verse 2: Jon z]
You will want to be with me again
No one is going to be like I was with you
No one like me sucks that clite
And with the same poses I never repeat
I am your favorite for that you return
None of them like me kisses you
With me fucking, smokes, fucking
And you drank thick codeine
To ’what he does and did I do it to you
February fourteen, stuffed animals and kisses
No one is going to love you as I loved you
I was even in the gray days
You can't forget me and now you call me
Chingas with him and he does not breast
Thinking about my to ’the day on your bed
I already forget you with whores and fame
[Bridge: Jon Z]
Who made you go well rich for the first time?
Who made you feel good, want again?
Who made you come very rich and for the first time?
Who made you feel good, and want again?

[Pre-car: Jon Z, Ñengo]
Time will tell you, you will not forget me
Deep feelings
That the heart cannot be erased
Time will tell you, you will not forget me
They say one nail takes another
Baby that only rhyme

[Choir: Jon Z & Ñengo Flow, Ñengo Flow]
No matter how much you are with him
You will never forget me
No matter how much you are with him
You will always think about me
When you fuck with him and he doesn't come to you
You will want to come back, you will want to come back
Where my
