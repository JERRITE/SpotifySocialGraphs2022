[Intro: Mau Montaner, Ricky Montaner & Fmk]
Yes
Mau and Ricky, Yeah
This is the big one
I went out of alcohol (I did 'the remix) and just wrote me
Take my address (Mau and Ricky)
Tell your friend that today we sleep at home (OH-OH)
The one you showed in your history ’'tá goodza (goodness)
You gave me a fernet in a cup (mmm)
And as always, Baby, what happens
[Chorus: Tiago Pzk, Tiago Pzk & Mau Montaner, FMK & Mau Montaner]
Turn on the camera and hagamo 'a pic
What if it goes up ’, baby, I give you retweet
I'm not Bad Bunny, but 'Toy in my peak
I give you slowly because you ere 'a hit
PRе-pre-challenge the camera and hagamo 'a pic (pic)
What if it goes up ', baby, I give you retweet (tweet; yeah-eh-eh)
I'm not Bad Bunny, but 'Toy in my peak
I give you slowly because you are a hit, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah (those of space, mami)

[Verse 1: Mau Montaner & Ricky Montaner]
I want to stay to see the sun rise with you, baby, all 'the days
And that you want to stay here without me asking you (okyy)
That ass, chocolate, which I like a lot
'You are looking at me like Mona Lisa
Do ’bottle’ from rum, you got a button
And now he is' kissing ’without a shirt
Upload a Storie, I reproduce it
And I tell you "Sorry" if I don't see it
A Toy Story doll, I don't believe it
You are more than a photo, baby, you ere 'a video, yaah

Oh, mamacita, you look pretty

Accommodamo 'the house because there is visit'
I brought Mau and Ricky and her to her little friend, because
You hit you ', I hit me while' everything 'look
He threw a kiss, looked at me around his neck, it's a vampire
And today until the Sun Dance 'Reggaetón, Wow-Wow-Wow-Wow comes out

Does not need the air, the baby already 'that burns
Tonight is the battery
It's time to tell him to the thing 'that would do (those of the house)
