I crawl to you lyricsDix ...
This is Kingon the leader who does not forget
Next to Pipe Calderón

Mami listen well this
I know it's early and what a shame if I bother you
Not that I am looking for a pretext
To feel your body ... baby

Mami listen well this
I know it's early and what a shame if I bother you
Not that I am looking for a pretext
To feel your body
Chorus

I want to be with you love
I want to tear off your pants
I despair then I want
That you lose control (x2)

While I crawl and crawl and crawl
While I crawl and crawl and crawl
While I like you, I wish you
I crawl to you and I crawled you and I crawl (x2)

Arriving at the hotel ... Saturday night that loquera
Lord Reykon asked me what a room you want
I tell you Miss Deme the one you want
At the end I am very crazy and I fall asleep wherever ...

It was not my fault to stay by his side
Board room, I am inciting sin
Only a wall has us separated
I break that hijuep ... and I lie down by his side

Chorus
I want to be with you love
I want to tear off your pants
I despair then I want
That you lose control (x2)
You Might Also Likeme Ashie Sigilano, step by silent step
I knew it was dangerous
And I got nervous, I did damage
And that woman right there caught me

And I lost control ... in the room
She cornered me ... and it turns out that the Gatia'o was me (x2)

Chorus
I want to be with you love
I want to tear off your pants
I despair then I want
That you lose control (x2)

While I crawl and crawl and crawl
While I crawl and crawl and crawl
While I like you, I wish you
I crawl to you and I crawled you and I crawl (x2)
