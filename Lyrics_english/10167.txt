The Herb Lyrics[Intro]
All Sess massive
I want yu just get active
Cah yu know seh inna dem time yah
Fi always think positive and think man, seen
Oh Lord have mercy

[Chorus]
And this is something me come yah fi tell everyone
Seh dat ah good Sensimilla ah it used to run dis land
About ah Sess di other day

And now di crack and cocaine
Whey ah bring pure destruction
[Verse 1]
That's why this morning me get up and me write three letter
Cah me seh, ah one adress now to di prime minister
Me seh di next one address to di security minister
Me neva dun di one to di commissioner
Because dem, dem ah hypocrites and confounder
Cause how di hell dem ago fight against Sensimilla
And ah it ah put poor people pot pon fire
Long we used to plant it nuff inna Jamaica
And dem burn it dung wid nuff police and soldier
And dem ah import di coke fi mash up we future

And dem seh it was found on Solomon grave
But true we tough on money, nuff man just ah crave
And dung inna heat like seh dem ah slave
