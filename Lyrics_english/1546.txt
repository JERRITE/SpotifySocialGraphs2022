TranslationsPortuguêsBLENDER Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
Is it lonely where you are?
All the way across the room
With a knife inside your heart
I feel it, too, mm
Is it just the way we are?
Always burnin' through the roof
Oh, I guess only the stars would know the truth, mm

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Calum]
I'd die for you, I'd die for you, I'd die for you (For you)
I tried for you, I tried for you, I tried
But all I hear is
[Chorus: Luke]
All the things you said in my head
Ricochetin' off the bed
Nothin' left, what a mess
Oh my god, it never ends
Now we're stressed and depressed
And we're goin' 'round again
In an еmotional blender
All the things you said in my hеad
Ricochetin' off the bed
Nothin' left, what a mess
Oh my god, it never ends
Now we're stressed and depressed
And we're goin' 'round again
In an emotional blender

[Verse 2: Luke, Luke & Calum]
But we just can't keep away
When you know me like you do
It's supernatural, got me howlin' at the moon

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Calum]
I'd die for you, I'd die for you, I'd die for you (For you)
I tried for you, I tried for you, I tried
But all I hear is

All the things you said in my head
Ricochetin' off the bed
Nothin' left, what a mess
Oh my god, it never ends
Now we're stressed and depressed
And we're goin' 'round again
In an emotional blender
All the things you said in my head
Ricochetin' off the bed
Nothin' left, what a mess
Oh my god, it never ends
Now we're stressed and depressed
And we're goin' 'round again
In an emotional blender

[Bridge: Luke]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro: Luke]
All the things I said in my head
Ricochetin' off the bed
Nothin' left, what a mess
Oh my god, it never ends
Now we're stressed and depressed
And we're goin' 'round again
In an emotional blender6Embed
