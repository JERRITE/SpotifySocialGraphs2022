TranslationSenglishromanization is just good (Just Right) Lyrics [Intro]
Baby, you are just
Just Right

[Verse 1]
Mirror, mirror, please tell me a little
Scope, you can tell me too
It's pretty without having to change anything
It is perfect as it is now
If you have to be happy, without worry
There is no shortage of what is lacking
Instead of the mirror, just look at my eyes
Take a look on my back instead of the scale
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how much you open you
Even if you see and see again
Where is the pretty part you are talking about
I can't find it where it is

[Chorus]
Like now
If you have it,
I don't want anything, so you do nothing
Don't change it
No worry
All yours come
Because it's all good, you do nothing
Don't change it

[Post-Chorus]
Like this (as it is now)
Oh (just like this)
Oh (as it is now)
I need to have oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Just like that, all yours are so your heart
Don't worry about it, don't worry
You can trust all a hundred percent
You can erase all worry
You might Also Like [Pre-Chorus]
No matter how much you open you
Even if you see and see again
Where is the pretty part you are talking about
I can't find it where it is

[Chorus]
Like now
If you have it,
I don't want anything, so you do nothing
Don't change it
No worry
All yours come
Because it's all good, you do nothing
Don't change it

[Post-Chorus]
Like this (as it is now)
Oh (just like this)
Oh (as it is now)
I need to have oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I only find it when I have a tee.
Brilliantly shine, there is no gap
How pretty in my eyes I want you
You'Re the only one as it is now
I only find it when I have a tee.
Brilliantly shine, there is no gap
How pretty in my eyes I want you
You'Re the only one as it is now
[Chorus]
Like now
If you have it,
I don't want anything, so you do nothing
Don't change it
No worry
Everything yours come
Because it's all good, you do nothing
Don't change it Mamama 6EMBED
