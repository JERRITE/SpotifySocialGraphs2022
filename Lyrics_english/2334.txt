You’re Almost There Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll admit that I still think about us
But not the way you’re hoping that I do
I don't wanna give you all the power
But talkin' over, this is overdue
Alright
I’m not saying we should be together
I just got a different point of view
These couple months been feeling like forever
But we both needed time to call a truce
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh-oh) I've spent all of this time thinking I'm right
(Oh-oh) I've been playing it back in my mind, like

[Chorus]
Was it you, was it me? I'm sorry
What's the use? Tryna see what are we
Giving up is only that much harder
(When you're almost there)
You and I called it love then started
To realize it'd be so much smarter
To give it up, but it’s so much harder
(When you’re almost there)

[Verse 2]
I don't hate you, I just want you to be happy
And if happy means that you got someone new
No, I’m not holding on, I wouldn't do that
And it's easier for me to tell the truth, okay
I think that you look real good together
Even if it was a little soon
A couple months, you're calling it forever
But looking back, we rushed that shit too, no, no

[Chorus]
Was it you, was it me? I’m sorry
What's the use? Tryna see what are we
Giving up is only that much harder
(When you're almost there)
You and I called it love then started
To realize it'd be so much smarter
To give it up, but it's so much harder
(When you're almost there)
(When you're almost there)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of this time thinking I'm right
(Oh-oh) I've been playing it back in my mind, like

[Chorus]
Was it you, was it me? I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
What's the use? Tryna see what are we
Giving up is only that much harder
(When you're almost there)
You and I called it love then started
To realize it'd be so much smarter
To give it up but it's so much harder
(When you're almost there)
When you're almost there
(When you're almost there)Embed
