Free Animal Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
You're the only one that can calm me down
My head spins in circles so I'm dizzy now
All of this time I should've figured it out

[Bridge]
I'm a free animal, free animal
I'm a free animal, free animal

[Chorus]
Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down
[Verse 2]
You get what you came for, what you stayed for
I only know how to satisfy your craving
This is what you crave
Know what you're made of, what you're made of
Flesh and bones won't lie
They won't lie

[Chorus]
Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down

[Bridge]
I'm a free animal, free animal
I'm a free animal, free animal
I'm a free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down

[Chorus]
Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me down
Free animal, free animal
My heart beats in patters to the broken sound
Free animal, free animal
You're the only one that can calm me downYou might also like5Embed
