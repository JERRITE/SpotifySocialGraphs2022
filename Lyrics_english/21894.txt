Farther Along Lyrics[Intro: Leslie Jordan]
Oh
Sometimes I do not feel worthy
Where's Vestal when you need her?

[Verse 1: Leslie Jordan]
Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living amongst us
Never molested, though in the wrong
[Chorus: Leslie Jordan & Morgane Stapleton]
Farther along, we'll know all about it
Farther along, we'll understand why
Just cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

[Post-Chorus: Leslie Jordan]
Yes, we will
Sister Morgan

[Verse 2: Morgane Stapleton & Leslie Jordan]
When we see Jesus coming in glory
When He comes down from His home in the sky (I can't stand it)
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
Farther along, we'll know all about it
Farther along, we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

[Post-Chorus: Leslie Jordan]
What about the boys?
Oh yeah

Farther along, we'll know all about it (People, yes, we will)
Farther along, we'll understand why (We'll understand)
Won't you cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
And we'll understand it (We'll understand it) all by and by
Yes, we'll understand it (We'll understand it) all by and by

[Outro: Morgane Stapleton, Leslie Jordan & Chris Stapleton]
Amen
Thank you, dearly beloved
All by and byEmbed
