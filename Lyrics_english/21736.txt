This Yearâ€™s Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
[Verse 2]
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul

[Pre-Hook]
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

[Hook]
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last

[Verse 3]
'Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on

[Pre-Hook]
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last ooh, ah yeah
This year's love it better last5Embed
