Fever Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lock myself in the dark
Try to fake some security
Where the better things are
And my shadow can't follow me
Something's haunting me
Charades and fever dreams

[Chorus]
I'm holding desperately to what's left of me, before I fall apart
Searching for anything to fight these enemies
But my only enemy is in my heart
Losing friends as fast as I've been losing sleep
It's overcast and I'm always six feet deep inside my mind
So this is goodbye
Goodbye
[Verse 2]
Take a drive in my car
Try to find my reality
Slam my fist on the wheel
Over again until my knuckles bleed
Cause I wanna feel something
Stuck in a fever dream
Make me believe something
More than this fever dream

[Chorus]
I'm holding desperately to what's left of me, before I fall apart
Searching for anything to fight these enemies
But my only enemy is in my heart
Losing friends as fast as I've been losing sleep
It's overcast and I'm always six feet deep inside my mind
So this is goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
