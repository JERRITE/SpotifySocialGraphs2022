Yuck-Sue-Yaach Lyrics[Chorus 1: Yung Trybez]
If you living off the land (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you stick it to the man (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you die for your people (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you see through the evil (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you’re a story teller (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you listen to your elders (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you speak your native tongue (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
We forever young (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)

[Verse 1: Yung Trybez]
Yuck-sue-yaach! Sounding like a savage
I don’t even understand em when he say that you the baddest
Survival is a habit, rally after rally
I get it from my ‘Op, I be stuntin like my daddy
We in the streets like Aladdin, its making me nostalgic
Nu-gwa ah-da nolagimi, that translates to magic
My mama’o gave me knowledge like “Sonny, you can have it”
I don’t mean I’m cookin dope but I be trappin at the cabin
Man that’s word to my granny, if ya’ll don’t understand me
I’m thankful for the salmon I’m providing for my family
And I’m livin off the land like the ones who did before me
I be passin on the stories of the ones who died before me
Man that’s Sasquatch habit, call me Young Buquis [Sasquatch]
I gave the city back cuz I’d rather have the bush
The rez is in the building, they afraid we coming up
The futures in our children, Yuck-Sue-Yaach
[Chorus 2]
If you a native academic (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If your craft is genetic (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you’re workin both your spirits (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you let em haters hear us (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If your urban space native (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you carry what is sacred (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If your hair is long and braided (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
You got me feelin like we made it (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)

[Verse 2: Young D]
Yuck-Sue-Yaach, I hit em with the warrior dance like
Yuck-sue-yaach, they say I’m michael jackson bad like
Yuck-sue-yaach, they say i look like my baba
Yuck-sue-yaach, my hair a lions mane like Simba
Yuck-sue-yaach, I feel the spirits around that fuego
What you know about a savage? shit I ain’t no average joe
They call me Moon child, red moons out
Hear the wolves howl, neechies on the prowl
Ride together and die together, that’s bad boy, go fear the feather
Generation 7 reppin’ section 35 forever
Warrior just like Kevin ’til creator calls my number
Me and brother bring that thunder so our culture ain't that 8th wonder (8th wonder)
I don’t want a statue, I prefer my carvings
Something I can rock with pride when that drum is calling
Lil neechie litty, belly gettin biggie, cheifin in the city
Feel like Diddy cuz I’m Yuck-Boy
You might also like[Chorus 3]
If you a master carver (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If your art is up for barter (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
Don’t give a damn about a dollar (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
But you gotta feed your daughter (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you gave your life to life giving (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you trust in the children (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
If you proud of your village (Yuck-Sue-Yaach)
We about to kill it…Embed
