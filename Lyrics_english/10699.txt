Bankrupt Lyrics[Intro]
Man these bitches ain't on shit
Man, I been popping, bitch just check my resume

[Verse 1]
Hundred bands, times a hundred bands
Can you get it, ain't no running man
Keep a hundred rounds, we gon' get him
I ain't never gave a fuck about no bitch
Cause I'm bigger and I'm better
Keep a Smith & Wesson, we can do whatever, aye
You say you a boss, I know you a lame
And that nigga ugly what the fuck you saying?
You ain't getting money girl you need a plan
You a broke bitch, always holding out your hand
I'm a real bitch, I just be getting bands
Spend and get it back and I split it with my mans
That money in my hands put it right on your head
Ain't no loss, I'm a boss I can do this shit again, aye
Fuck a role we speak facts!
If a lame bitch talking I won't even speak back
Keep that .45 all black, we strapped, we back
Pop up on 'em make a bitch see that, aye
[Hook]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, aye!

[Verse 2]
Aye, I'm a real bitch I can't fake shit
You a fucking pussy you don't say shit
You just figured it out, bruh, you late bitch
You a broke bitch you ain't got no bands to play with
Somewhere out in Cali do the dash in a spaceship
You somewhere in the crib looking mad cause you ain't shit

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us

[Hook]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, aye
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, aye

Bitch bands, bands, gon' fuck up the dashboard
Bitches want problems we gon' give 'em what they ask for
That's what this cash for, I need that like a landlord
You bitches half step, somebody please drop a bag on 'em
Bitch why you lying you ain't never got no cash ho
Ho you nigga why you trying to act tough ain't no straps on you
Bitches turned their back, yeah its cool I just stacked on 'em
I was getting money way before I seen rap money
Them hoes hate together when that check end
But bitch you more broke than your best friend
That chop right beside me like my best man
Fuck a wedding when it ring watch her head split

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us
You ain't tough, big bank take little bank
Bitch you bankrupt
All them hoes losing but they ain't us

[Hook]
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, aye
Fuck all them niggas we gon' fuck up this cash
I hopped out my feelings and I hopped in my bag
Hopped in a foreign, bitch you hopped in a cab
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass, aye
[Outro]
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass
Still living with your mama you ain't hopped off your ass8Embed
