Blame On Me Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
I  don't like to go outside 'cause I can't stand the rain
I  walk outside with all this pride 'cause I can't stand the pain
My eyes been open since I seen the things you really do
Act like you know it all but if only you really knew
I'm  not gon' lie you caught me off guard 'cause I was feeling you
So  I started to move the way you move and now it's killing you
Used to break her spine for real, my niggas gon' ride for real
Fuck  up your Jungle Gym cause me and my niggas gon' slide for real
I looked these niggas in their eyes before I sign a deal
I don't fuck with you don't fuck with me 'cause you can die for real
I think about the beans these niggas really try to spill
There  was no respect it was life or death and we surviving still
Don't know how it feels, so I gotta keep it real
You better watch what you say don't come out your face cause you can get killed
Niggas talk shit everyday cause they feel a way so fuck how they feel, really it's fuck how they feel, I think it's time i keep it real
I ain't got nothin' to say when I feel like I'm buggin' I pray
I got a new bitch and yeah we do shit but I ain't gon' fuck her the same
Got treated like shit she say im the shit so now she gon' fuck up my name
Them niggas who said I was ass can go eat an ass when i'm running the game
Don't play with my heart like that
I ain't think it would start like that
When I open my eyes I can't see shit cause I be in the dark like that
I treated you good when nobody would I played my part like that
If you fucking around you gotta let me know so I don't get my heart attached
I know what you do before you do it you ain't slick like that
I can do what you do to me to you but I don't get like that
You did what you did for way too long cause you ain't shit like that
I used to make you touch your toes and give you dick like that
These bullet holes can fuck up your clothes you could get hit like that
I travelled this road I been on my own I'm taking trips like that
I puff puff puff and I don't pass i'm smokin' spliffs like that
I know i'm still young but i grew up fast I ain't no kid like that
You be on some sucker shit
You think you fuckin' slick
Hit it from the back and then I dip cause I can't trust no bitch
How could you change on me
Gotta take it to the grave with me
I gave you a chance when i shouldn't have
So put the blame on meYou might also like13Embed
