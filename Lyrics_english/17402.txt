Mop Wit It Lyrics[Verse 1: MO3]
Got it on lock, real nigga made it to the top
Why they wanna change on me?
Looking like a lick
Watch cost a buck, damn brick
All these goddamn chains on me
Don't make no sense, real street nigga made it out
Got-got a lot of change on me
Ain’t worried bout a opp
I can get him hit right now with the goddamn thing on me
[Chorus: MO3 & Boosie Badazz]
When I mop wit it, mop wit it
F&N imma keep the Glock with me
I'm talking bout a stick in a house wit it
Whole lotta money on the couch wit it
Mop wit it mop wit it
Count a lot of dough i'm at the top nigga
Underlay underlay I keep a k
Fuck around get your ass mopped nigga

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Southside mop wit it (mop wit it), mop wit it (mop wit it)
Everybody out here got a Glock wit me
Everybody got it in their hand, everybody ready to mob
A nigga mama, whole house wit me
Southside mop wit it, mop wit it
Shining cold on these niggas like a icicle
I turn your minivan nigga to a bicycle
Moral to the story, i just mopped that bitch ass nigga
Imma mop a nigga up fore’ a nigga mop me
Hope they love me like Cole when a nigga stop me
Cop killers in this bitch this a mop machine
M16 its a mop machine
Lil bitch we on top
I fall asleep counting up the money
It's too much I can't fit it in the vault
I don't even wanna answer the phone
I'm like 'leave me alone'
'Cause I’m shittin’ on these niggas right now
South south side mop wit it (thug life) mop wit it (thug life)
Thuggin' lil nigga gon’ pop wit me
If he getting a little money go get more money
You gon' be like me in the drop nigga
Hot boy hot wit it (Boosie Badazz) i'm hot wit it (hot wit it)
I'm up now nigga talking sky limit
The question is dawg when he gone’ fall off
I ain't falling off till I get mopped nigga, it's on lock
