Brace for Impact Lyrics[Verse 1]
I suppose that in the end
I deserve the words you said
And this body, I've [?]
And I suppose that when we die
There's no one there to testify
If life was good or if I wasted mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop myself
From tumbling down
I can't stop myself
I see that now
[Chorus]
But I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time
Oh, I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time
Don't brace for impact
Don't brace for impact

[Verse 2]
Purgatory holds us here
There's no escape from what is real
When your identity is up to them
The systematic step by step
Is not the way I wanna live
So hold me back when I can reach the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop myself
From tumbling down
I can't stop myself
I see that now

[Chorus]
But I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time (Oh)
Oh, I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time
Don't brace for impact
Don't brace for impact
(Brace for impact)

[?] the street outside (Oh)
Two little girls are riding bikes (Whoa)
I realize it's Audrey and I when we were little (Whoa)
Audrey pedals and keeps up with the boy (Ooh)
The child I thought was me falls onto the ground [?] (Oh)
She's deformed, much too small (Whoa)
Undeveloped like a utero and freezing cold to the touch (Whoa)
I hold her, me? To my bare skin inside my hoodie (Ooh)
But she squirms and looks up at me with her [?] face

If you don't hold me back (Oh)
When I can reach the end (Whoa)
You still can save yourself from the [?] (Whoa)
(I keep saying, I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I can't tell if I'm dreaming, I can't tell if I'm dreaming)

[Chorus]
But I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time (Oh)
Oh, I could taste the edge of the light
Pulled myself aside just in time
Don't brace for impact
Don't brace for impact
(Brace for impact)
[Outro]
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh

And I can't tell if I'm dreaming
And I can't tell if I'm dreamingEmbed
