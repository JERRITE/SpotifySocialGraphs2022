6 months Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feels like it's been six months and seven days
When I'm without you
There ain't no way I don't think about you, yeah
All I do is think about you, yeah
I love when you get so shy
That your cheeks turn red
How am I the only guy inside your head?
I'm thinking out loud
Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause baby, when we fall asleep
You know that you're safe with me
Baby, this is all we need
And we're right where we belong
Wish I didn't have to go
It's hard to leave you all alone
Even when we're far from home
Yeah, we're right where we belong

[Verse 2]
All this space between us
Yeah, it starts to hurt
I'm getting jealous of my own t-shirt
The way it holds you, yeah, yeah
You know I wish that I could hold you
Haven't slept in three nights
Yeah, you're on my mind
Flipping through photographs to pass the time
I'm thinking 'bout you ('Bout you)
Yeah, I'm always thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, when we fall asleep
You know that you're safe with me
Baby, this is all we need
And we're right where we belong
Wish I didn't have to go
It's hard to leave you all alone
Even when we're far from home (Ooh)
Yeah, we're right where we belong
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Right where
Know I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah, we're right where we belong, yeah
Yeah, baby, no

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, when we fall asleep
You know that you're safe with me
Baby, this is all we need
And we're right where we belong
Wish I didn't have to go
It's hard to leave you all alone
Even when we're far from home
Yeah, we're right where we belong

[Outro]
Girl, I really love you
Yeah, we're right where we belong, yeah
You know I really love you, love you, yeah
You know I'll always love you
Yeah, we're right where we belongEmbed
