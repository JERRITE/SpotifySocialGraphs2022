Staying Gold Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't keep looking for the answer
I can't keep hating on everything
I know this is a pointless conversation
I think I'm losing my mind
Who could I run to?
Who can I speak to?
How could I let you know?
That's why

[Refrain]
I don't, I don't believe you
I'm never coming home
I wish I could believe like belief was is in my bones
I could do it my own way not ever coming home
But I don't think I believe you
Believe in staying gold x3
Believe in staying gold, gold, gold
[Verse 2]
I know that you don't got the answer
Still I open my eyes
Despite my moral degradation
In the shadow of a moment in time
Who can I run to?
Who can I speak to?
How could I let you know, that I need you now?
I got nothing now x3
That's why

[Refrain]
I don't, I don't believe you
I'm never coming home
I wish I could believe like belief was is in my bones
I could do it my own way not ever coming home
But I don't think I believe you
Believe in staying gold x3
Believe in staying gold, gold, gold

[Verse 3]
He never bothered to
If God won't take you
We'll find a better place to call (home)

[Refrain]
I don't, I don't believe you
I'm never coming home
I wish I could believe like belief was is in my bones
I could do it my own way not ever coming home
But I don't think I believe you
Believe in staying

If God made love
He also made pain
And then He disappeared and never bothered to explain
If I'm goin' die
And you're goin' die
At least I know the reasonEmbed
