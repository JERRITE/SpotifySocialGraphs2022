Teen Queen Lyrics[Intro]

There's needles in my back
That are holding me together
And no matter what I do I know my heart is made of leather
Like Jesus to a thief
Like a father to a son
It came to me like an epiphany and now the deed is
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
[Verse 1]

I've travelled through hell and all of its towns
God only knows where I've been
I'm the only girl that can wear the crown
Yes I'm your new teen queen

[Pre-Chorus]

You can call me narcissistic
But please don't forget sadistic

[Chorus]

I, I am your new teen queen
Nothing that they've ever seen
Your time on stage is through
Make way for someone
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new

[Verse 2]

Pedestal of infamy ain't so bad
And I am liking the view
All you other wannabes may think I'm mad
Ain't no such thing as bad news
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

You might think that I am senseless
But please don't forget pretentious

[Chorus]

I, I am your new teen queen
Nothing that they've ever seen
Your time on stage is through
Make way for someone
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new

[Bridge]

Teen queen
Teen queen
Like Jesus to a thief
Like a father to a son
It came to me like an epiphany and now the deed is
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done, done, done

[Chorus]

I, I am your new teen queen
Nothing that they've ever seen
Your time on stage is through
Make way for someone new
I am your new teen queen
Nothing that they've ever seen
Your time on stage is through
Make way for someone
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, newEmbed
