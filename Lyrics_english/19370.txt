WokRock Lyrics[Intro]
Y'all niggas know how we rockin', man
If you a opp get shot in your top, no cap
(Ayo Waterboy, this shit wet)
Skrrt, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, ha, ha (WokRock, WokRock)
Yeah, yeah, ha, ha (WokRock, WokRock), yeah, yeah, ha, ha (WokRock, WokRock)
Yeah, yeah, ha, ha (WokRock, WokRock), yeah, yeah, ha, ha (WokRock, WokRock)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Young nigga hopped out the coupe (Hopped out the coupe, woo)
If she not fuckin', the boot (If she not fuckin', the boot)
These niggas keep tryna get in the loop
These niggas keep tryna fuck with the crew (Fuck with the crew)
Out through the city, the truck bulletproof (Truck bulletproof)
Them boys comin' through, boy, you boys better move
Them boys comin' through, boy, you boys better move
I always spit heat, when I'm in the booth (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
She fell in love with the life that I live (Life that I live)
Keep blowin' up my phone, I'm tired of this bitch
I beat up the pussy like Tyson, bitch (Like Tyson, bitch)
She doin' splits on my dick and all types of shit (All types of shit)
I keep a Glock in my fanny pack (My fanny pack)
I dare a opp to run at me, get blast (Grrrr, bah)
I bought the Glock with the switch attached
I'm in the front, I don't play in the back (I don't play in the back)
[Verse]
Cuban link chain with the bracelet to match (Bracelet to match)
I been gettin' this bread since a jit, that's a fact (That's a fact)
Yea, haha, come get your chain back, haha, haha
You broke and my pockets fat (My pockets fat)
Hopped out the Maybach, this shit matted black (Skrr)
Got that thing on my waist, you know I never lack (I never lack)
Pull out the Draco, man, this shit not a prop
We spin your block, air it out, make it hot (Make it hot)
If she not fuckin', the boot, get out (The boot, get out)
Young nigga hopped in the coupe, I'm out
Young nigga hopped out the coupe (Young nigga hopped out the coupe)
If she not fuckin', the boot (If she not fuckin', the boot)
These niggas keep tryna fuck with the crew (These niggas tryna)
These niggas keep tryna steal all the moves
These niggas keep tryna steal all the swag (All the swag)
They mad that MarGielaa Man get to the bag (Yeah, yeah)
They mad that MarGielaa Man get to the bag (Yeah, one, two)

[Chorus]
Young nigga hopped out the coupe (Hopped out the coupe, woo)
If she not fuckin', the boot (If she not fuckin', the boot)
These niggas keep tryna get in the loop (Get in the loop)
These niggas keep tryna fuck with the crew (Yeah, yeah)
Out through the city, the truck bulletproof (Truck bulletproof)
Them boys comin' through, boy, you boys better move (Move)
Them boys comin' through, boy, you boys better move (Better move)
I always spit heat, when I'm in the booth (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
She fell in love with the life that I live (Life that I live)
Keep blowin' up my phone, I'm tired of this bitch (I'm tired of this bitch)
I beat up the pussy like Tyson, bitch (Like Tyson, bitch)
She doin' splits on my dick and all types of shit (All types of shit)
I keep a Glock in my fanny pack (My fanny pack)
I dare a opp to run at me, get blast (Grrrr, bah)
I bought the Glock with the switch attached (Grrr)
I'm in the front, I don't play in the back (I don't play in the back)
