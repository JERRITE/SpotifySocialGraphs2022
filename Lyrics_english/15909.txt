I love you so much, so much Lyrics [lyrics of "I love you so much, so much"]

[Verse 1: ari]
If you may understand
I don't know how to express myself well
If maybe I could make you see
That there is no other woman better than you for me

[Verse 2: Mariana]
Yes maybe
You will make me happy
Yes maybe
You could tell me
Yes maybe
Detail in detail
You could conquer me, it would be yours
[Chorus: Both]
I love you so much, so much, so much, so much so much
Every day a little more, ah-ah
I love you so much, so much, so much, so much so much
For me there is nothing the same, there is no
I love you so much, so much, so much, love
I can't anymore
I can not anymore

[Verse 3: Ari, Mariana]
Well, maybe the world will learn
With our love how beautiful it is to love
And maybe repeat it again
Couple per couple the whole world at last

[Chorus: Both]
I love you so much, so much, so much, so much so much
Every day a little more, ah-ah
I love you so much, so much, so much, so much so much
For me there is nothing the same, there is no
I love you so much, so much, so much, love
I can't anymore
I can not anymore

[Outro: all]
I can not anymore
I can no moreyou mihht Also like1embed
