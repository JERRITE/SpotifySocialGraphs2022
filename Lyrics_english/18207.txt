Sideways Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always five below the speed limit driving
It feels like that’s what my entire life’s been
I never drank, never hung out with the wrong crowd
'Cause it looked good from the outside in
I had it figured out

[Pre-Chorus]
Like it was a routine
Hiding all the parts of me I didn’t like
Things that I never wanted to be seen
[Chorus]
I had the highest GPA, never made it home too late
Thinking it could keep my world from falling apart
Almost like it was a way to fix the things that I can’t change
But I was born with a sideways heart
With a sideways heart

[Verse 2]
Haven’t broken a bone, gotten high or wasted
I’d avoid all those types of situations
And it’s probably all because there’s addiction in my blood
Staying clear of it was how I cleaned it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Like it was a routine
Hiding all the parts of me I didn’t like
Things that I never wanted to be seen

[Chorus]
I had the highest GPA, never made it home too late
Thinking it could keep my world from falling apart
Almost like it was a way to fix the things that I can’t change
But I was born with a sideways heart
With a sideways heart

[Outro]
I had the highest GPA, never made it home too late
Thinking it could keep my world from falling apart
Almost like it was a way to fix the things that I can’t change
But I was born with a sideways heart
With a sideways heartYou might also likeEmbed
