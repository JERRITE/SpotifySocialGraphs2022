Pissed Off and Mad About It LyricsThis one is how I feel
And this one is so surreal
And this one is so unreal
And this one is how I feel
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad about it
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad about it
This one is the pain revealed
And this one is the truth unsealed
And this is the sword I wield
And this is my battlefield
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad about it
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad the fuck about it!
This is how I feel
And this is so surreal
And this is so unreal
And this is how I feel
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad about it
Guess you've heard about it
Pissed off & mad about it
So let me scream & shout it
Pissed off & mad about itYou might also likeEmbed
