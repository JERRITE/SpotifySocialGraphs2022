Dune Lyrics [text of "dunes"]

[Verse 1]
More Tedua than Tony
More Mowgli than Tarzan
A DECA of DAWEE to be taken away (Amsterdam)
A size on his head
But with a cut with a shaded shaving
In the clearing your brotherhood gathers
Ass from pa-tone spit from the Bal-Cone
Smoking, make a ca -per
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles in my pot
I want closed houses for the institution, this since
On the street a pimp is bought women
Then go your husband and you buy love
(Br br brr)
Feel Baccano, Free, from the Vatican
Because they sighted a viados between nuns
Find the envelopes inside the Pusher shoes
The cop for the search
(Brr)
[Refrain]
Around Ciro buys and sells but
Where the wind pulls goes
The flag of his always changes it
Money in your pocket, pocket here
Cucaracha, Uh Ah Ah!
It doesn't go hunting, he sends a appearance
He eats and fills himself
Ciro, Ciro, you have not yet killed me
Ciro, Ciro
He will find his way to make a million
Will return from the gang to which he gave the name
He will buy a better house for his mom
And will bring the grandchildren with it to the hotel
The father is to make prison and sert

[Verse 2]
I look at the road then after through
When she speaks, she passes me through
Canna shot does not go sideways
They throw shit on the foreigner
All the fauna moves if there is a opposite time
Taking a different path
Call the "Leonessa" woman
Like Ren√® Vallanzasca
She has more follows and more money
It is fascinated by me
Move ready to hit
If you die on behalf of whom
Free, Mowgli is co-control the tiger
In the report at the end
Gazelles, panthers
For the thieves
The neighborhood is believed to be a forest
The king in question called Leone
But it is free of mane
This happens if the comfortable people
He says to him: "Please, he cars" elect "
More Silvio than Simba
More Ovid than Brera
