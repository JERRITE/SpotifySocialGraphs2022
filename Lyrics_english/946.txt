[Chorus]
I don't want more to speak to me about love
I already tired, to 'that' trick 'already
That 'pain' I 'passed it, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh
I don't want more to speak to me of love (no, no)
I got tired, to 'that' trick 'already' I know (wuh)
That 'pain' I 'passed it (no, no)

[Verse]
Today I hate you, not and 'secret, first of all I confess (no)
If I could, I asked you to return 'to' kiss' that I gave you
The 'word' and all the time I lost
I regret one and a thousand, I have fought 'in you (Wuh!)
I would like it to feel you 'like me I feel (I feel)
I would like to be like you, without feeling '(-miento')
I would like to get you out of my thought (-Ment)
I would like to change the end to the story
Toa 'the' bar 'and the' drink 'have witnessed'
Of the pain you caused me and to 'what you did with me
An unhappy in love that still does not surpass you
And that now walks alone, with no one, for Toa 'La' Sidera '
Asking God if love really exists
And why if I was so good toa 'this shit did you make me (-Code)
The most bastard e 'that you see' everything like a joke
I'm always going to curse the day you were born
The 'chocolate' that I gave you and all 'the' flore '(-re')
They become nightmare today 'and Dolore'
I already lost the faith that you improve '(-jore')
If I later 'from the rain comes out the arc', but without color ', Yeh
[Chorus]
I don't want anyone to talk to me more
I already tired, to 'that' trick 'already
That 'pain' I 'passed it, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh
I don't want anyone to talk to me more
I already tired, to 'that' trick 'already
That 'Paine' I spent, Yeh, Yeh, Yehyou Might Also Like104embed
