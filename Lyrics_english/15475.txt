10 for the 10 lyricslas six forty -three cold water in my skin
And one foot after another foot craws towards the day
Fruit and honey know sheets of paper
And the nine thirty -three feel so empty

Life changes direction
The hours lose their meaning and their voice
And they slowly leave my heart

And so time goes slowly
And in an instant what I feel is losing color
And little by little of my mind is coming
Returns time when life had flavor
The hours that go back and you are no longer
And each sigh is taken the day
Ten for ten o'clock
Water and coffee are filled with apathy

Life changes direction
The hours lose their meaning and their voice
And they slowly leave my heart

And so time goes slowly
And in an instant what I feel is losing color
And little by little of my mind is coming
Returns time when life had flavor

And so time goes slowly
And in an instant what I feel is losing color
And little by little of my mind is coming
Returns time when life had flavor

And so time goes slowly
And in an instant what I feel is losing color
And little by little of my mind is coming
Returns time when life had flavoryou might Also likembed
