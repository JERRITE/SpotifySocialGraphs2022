[Intro: Randy & Cazzu]
Blah blah blah blah
That Shorty is placed on movie
That ass took the trophy
He told me to love me and I believe him, oh-oh
It has always been my fan (fanatic)
E 'fine but satanic medium (satanic)
I later 'from the album I rob me, I like everything
She has a kitten but e 'a little dump (oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus: Cazzu]
She dances like a stripper
And on my face I bounces those buttocks'
He doesn't care to criticize
He has a couple of crazy friends 'but she' the best

[Verse 1: Cazzu]
Y-and-and sе unleashes, he takes away
Guatauba-Guata, Mommy, How Linda еsas Gata '
He does it for silver but not with me
He likes the baby 'but now I like it
I like your tattoo that reaches you to cu
Rompelo, Guacha, that seems Kung-Fu
Ask for what the menu wants to
Chose 69 and cold shampoo

[Chorus: Cazzu]
She dances like a stripper
And on my face I bounces those buttocks'
He doesn't care to criticize
He has a couple of crazy friends 'but she' the best

[Verse 2: from the ghetto & randy]
Chiquitita is, but Culona
What it has is pure, it is not short with acetone
It's like a goal for Maradona's time
I've been giving him 'the me' and he doesn't even mention me
Pré-Préndase the 'phillie', tell me where he is
To-all 'Las Bellaca', tell me where he is
Those who chichan, smoke 'and drink, tell me where you are, the note, the chulito explodes (Puh)
And I don't give him brake
The amount on the bug and put it in play
The pink panther to'a night by law
How much does' the private, Baby Girl? I Pay-Ay-Ayday-Ay-Ay
You wear squeeze 'pa' that the pinga stops me (eh)
With the tit 'bouncing, Cazzu, I almost gets away (huh)
For this bi 'I pull it, it does not come out' (huh)
Does not bite my head, Baby, that is not worth it
