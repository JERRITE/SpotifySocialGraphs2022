Warmth (Outro) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never good, still the bad and the ugly
Laid in front of us
Clearly we've learned nothing at all
From the TV's window

[Chorus]
Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth, I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat, I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth, I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat, I feel how cold it can get
So draw me close
[Verse 2]
So come on, let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with musicYou might also like18Embed
