Oh No (I Think I’m In Love) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me, we're different as people
Always at one when it's needed
I just can't remember anything without you
You've got blue skies in your head
This time, I'll make sure on my end
I don't find anything I don't like about you

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
[Verse 2]
Home is, home is where I'll be
When you're standing beside me
I've never been so sure about it, can you tell?
This is all that I wanted
I'll never take your love for granted
You make all this so easy on my heart

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
Then you gave me more than I came for
I was aching, in time my pain cured
Now I've fallen, talking for once
And this is how I feel

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you
Oh no, I think I'm in love with you

[Outro]
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in love withYou might also like2Embed
