Juliet & Romeo Lyrics[Verse]
World's moving so slow
Got my hand out the window
Lose track of time and memory
Losing my mind in the palm trees
Got me believing you're so shy
You catch me looking an you hide your eyes
Leaving behind the reality
Become the cool of formalities

[Chorus]
You know we should be dancing
Tell me that you wanna go, dancing
You and me in stereo, dancing
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
You and I, we gotta keep dancing
Oh yeah, sweating in the afterglow, dancing
Juliet and Romeo, dancing
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Girl, stop hiding
[Post-Chorus]
Hiding
Oh-oh
Girl, stop hiding

[Verse]
World's moving so slow
Got my hand out the window
Lose track of time and memory
Losing my mind in the palm trees

[Chorus]
You know we should be dancing
Tell me that you wanna go, dancing
You and me in stereo, dancing
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
You and I, we gotta keep dancing
Oh yeah, sweating in the afterglow, dancing
Juliet and Romeo, dancing
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Girl, stop hiding

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you know we should be dancing
Dancing
Dancing
Intoxicated, this is how we wanna be
Girl, stop hidingYou might also likeEmbed
