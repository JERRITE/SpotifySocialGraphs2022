From that night Lyrics [lyrics of "from that night" ft. Maluma]

[Intro: Maluma]
Thalia
Maluma

[Pre-Chorus: Thalia & Maluma]
From that night I miss you in my room
I think I can fall into an addiction with you
I never expected such a story
I feel a thousand things for you, I feel a thousand things
[Chorus: Thalia & Maluma]
Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
What happens to you that you don't want, love?
Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
But I'm afraid to fall in love, from you

[Post-Chorus: Thalia, Maluma & both]
And I from you, and I from you
You do not of me, you not of me
And I from you
But I'm afraid to fall in love, from you
And I from you, and I from you
You do not of me, you not of me
And I from you
But I'm afraid to fall in love, love

[See 2: Thalia & Maluma]
I want to fill you with a thousand things and pinks of a thousand colors
I want to give you the songs, that they only tell you about love
And what do you think of me, I want you to be happy
I already suffered what I should suffer, I hardly believe in me
Let's take it slow, even if I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Thalia & Maluma]
From that night I miss you in my room
I think I can fall into an addiction with you
I never expected such a story
I feel a thousand things for you, I feel a thousand things

Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
What happens to you that you don't want, love?
Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
But I'm afraid to fall in love, from you

[Post-Chorus: Thalia, Maluma; Both of them]
And I from you, and I from you
You do not of me, you not of me
And I from you
But I'm afraid to fall in love
Pretty boy

[Bridge: Maluma]
So you tell me that you love me, you say you worship me
That among all men it is me who falls in love
Baby, why don't you decide to give me
Your little heart I'm going to take care of you

[See 3: Thalia & Maluma]
I want to fill you with a thousand things and pinks of a thousand colors
I want to give you the songs, that they only tell you about love
And what do you think of me, I want you to be happy
I already suffered what I should suffer, I hardly believe in me
Let's take it slow, even if I feel
Baby
[Bridge: Thalia]
AAH-AH-AAH
I'm dying here
Love love love love

[Chorus: Thalia & Maluma]
Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
What happens to you that you don't want, love?
Understand that since that night, I only think of you
From that night, I'm dying here
But I'm afraid to fall in love, from you

[Post-Chorus: Thalia, Maluma; Both of them]
And I from you, and I from you
You do not of me, you not of me
And I from you
But I'm afraid to fall in love, from you
And I from you, and I from you
You do not of me, you not of me
And I from you
But I'm afraid to fall in love, love2embed
