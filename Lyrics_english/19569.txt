Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Still I want you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh
[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Shoulda never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

[Refrain: Doja Cat]
Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (Hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

[Pre-Chorus: Doja Cat]
(And I)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(And I)
Needеd a fix of you, not just one kiss from you
I needed more

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Lovе got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

All I want is you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Tryna stay in my lane
I should play on the safe side
But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pourin' all over you
Know exactly what I wanna do
So, baby, can you get it from the back?
Got me purrin' like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag
'Cause you wanna hear me say I'm comin' back
But this time, I want support, just make it last
Woah-oh (Ah)

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
It's hard for me to let you go (Let you go)
