Kings of Summer (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Quinn XCII]
I’ve been out here waiting for nightfall
It feels so right when the lights don't fade
Days like these don't last so we might stall
We've been living like kings and we hope it don’t change
We stand by the notion that anything goes
I'm feeling this motion from morning to close
And even when night takes the day we don't care
That's how we build on these memories we share

[Hook: Quinn XCII]
Like mom's not home
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
[Pre-Chorus: Quinn XCII]
One, two, three

[Chorus: Quinn XCII]
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home
Just a couple kids livin' on our own
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young

[Verse 2: Quinn XCII]
I leave
Worries behind, sun in my eyes
Summer breeze
Lay on my skin, I come alive
Sweet waves
They're crashing in, water and wine
These days
That's all I need, some peace of mind
So I hop out the window, I make this my own
Them good vibes my symbol
Now I'm free to roam
And even when night takes the day we don't care
That's how we build on these memories we share x3

Tell me why the best things feel so wrong
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home
Just a couple kids living on our own
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young2Embed
