If I Really Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yesterday you told me that you wanna be alone
I could hear the distance in your voice over the phone
You don't say "I love you" back
Or let your feelings show
You used to be so good at that
But now I never know

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real
[Chorus]
'Cause, maybe, I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go

[Verse 2]
Midnight drives in your old sweatshirts never felt so cold
And I still hear the stupid songs you showed me everywhere I go
I can taste the hesitation running from your lips
I can feel it in my bones they're breaking
We can't end like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish you would hold me
I wish you would tell me how you feel
Want you to show me
If anything left in this is real

[Chorus]
'Cause, maybe, I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go

[Bridge]
Moments wrapped and romance
That end with bitter sunrises and goodbyes
Moments so fragile and rare
That I wonder if it would have the same taste
If not such a delicacy
But I'd still devour you
As I lay here and recall years of wavering emotions
Suppressed desires and volcanic explosions
That retreat into dormancy
I wonder could we ever flow together
Or are we two twin souls
Finding each other in the wrong lifetime?
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause, maybe, I'm afraid to
See you dancing on your own
If I really love you
I'll let you go

[Outro]
If I really love you
I'll let you go3Embed
