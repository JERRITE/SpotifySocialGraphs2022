I Will Always Love You (Live from The Bodyguard Tour) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Hopefully you've all had a good time. I know I've had a good time being here with you. Did you have a good time? Oh, I'm so glad. God bless you and yours. Take care of yourselves, and take care of one another. Before I go...

[Verse 1]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

[Chorus]
And I will, oh I, will always love you
I will always love you
You, you, you
My darling, you
[Verse 2]
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 3]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I'm wishing you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
I, I will always love you
You, I will always love, ooh
Oh, yes
You

Darling, I love you
I'll always
