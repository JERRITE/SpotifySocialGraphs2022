[Verse 2]
Gyalis from school days, pants take in, well straight
Stop down a bus park, step inna school well late
Borrow mi dawg endz, everyday is a new face
And mi get gyal everyday, but Friday was mi fave
Did haffi use lyrics because me never have waves
Dem time deh when mi young and wild, mi nuh have ears
Now me older now and a deal with the streets a way
And mi exchange number after mi exchange DNA
Magician with my voice, she do anything weh mi say (Yeah!)
She say, she have a man, but she give it up anyway
The short gyal you have, mi know she lonely
When she horny and want her fuck, you nuh deh deh
Hmm, play this for my sons
Play this for the old bwoy them weh feel like say them young
Fuck her inna di hours, cut before the morning sun
And any gyal mi deal with, them haffi rate me to the ground
You a hear me? (Vendetta!)
[Chorus]
Them anuh no gallis for me (no-no, no-no)
Make me tell you something if you never know
Idiot bwoy, you make it easier fi me
