TranslationsFran√ßaisBETTER OFF DEAD Lyrics[Chorus]
It's been cloudy with a chance of depression
Broke my heart and I learned my lesson
It's already over in my head
It's been cloudy with a chance of anxiety
Can't keep out the demons inside of me
Maybe I'm just better off dead

[Refrain]
'Cause you love me and you hate me
Use your body to sedate me
And you make me fucking crazy
You made me miserable
[Chorus]
It's been cloudy with a chance of depression
Broke my heart and I learned my lesson
It's already over in my head
It's been cloudy with a chance of anxiety
Can't keep out the demons inside of me
Maybe I'm just better off dead

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
Why you always gotta have the last word?
You know all my passwords
Watch you walk away, I'm bendin' backwards
Don't tell me that you love me and you miss me when you're plastered
Who can fuck each other over faster? Disaster
You make me worse, not better
You act like, "So, whatever"
Mistake my pain for pleasure
You change your mind like the weather

[Chorus]
Cloudy with a chance of depression
Broke my heart and I learned my lesson
It's already over in my head
It's been cloudy with a chance of anxiety
Can't keep out the demons inside of me
Maybe I'm just better off dead
It's been cloudy with a chance of depression
Broke my heart and I learned my lesson
It's already over in my head
It's been cloudy with a chance of anxiety
Can't keep out the demons inside of me
Maybe I'm just better off dead (Maybe I'm just better off dead)

[Chorus]
It's been cloudy with a chance of depression
Broke my heart and I learned my lesson
It's already over in my head
It's been cloudy with a chance of anxiety
Can't keep out the demons inside of me
Maybe I'm just better off dead (Maybe I'm just better off dead)

[Refrain]
'Cause you love me and you hate me
Use your body to sedate me
And you make me fucking crazy
You made me miserable31Embed
