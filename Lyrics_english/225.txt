SNOFALL Lyrics[Chorus: Jeezy]
Can't lie, it's been a rocky road
Nigga, I been busy like the chef on Windy Hills at the Pappadeaux
Still grindin' like it's pots and O's
Amalfi Coast, tell Solo hit my line when the deal is closed
Billionaire mindset, yeah, goals is goals
What's up? We just get the wap, nigga, hoes is hoes
Pink slips and the deeds, yeah, we live for those
Lube 'em up with the grease, like in Mykonos

[Interlude: DJ Drama & Jeezy]
Can't lie, it's been a cold world
Nigga, I been busy like a chef at Thanksgiving (Gangsta Grillz)
Still grindin' like it's a five-dollar big save hustle
I been on fire recently
Tеll Lake to holla at me when thе deal is closed
[Chorus: Jeezy]
Can't lie, it's been a rocky road
Nigga, I been busy like the chef on Windy Hills at the Pappadeaux
Still grindin' like it's pots and O's
Amalfi Coast, tell Solo hit my line when the deal is closed (Gangsta)
Billionaire mindset, yeah, goals is goals
What's up? We just get the wap, nigga, hoes is hoes
Pink slips and the deeds, yeah, we live for those
Lube 'em up with the grease (Gangsta Grilzz), like in Mykonos
