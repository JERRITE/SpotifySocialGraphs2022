How do you want you not to miss you anymore
I used to
I just smoke good
How do you want me to take away from the poison
I used to

How do you want you not to miss you anymore
I used to
I used to
How do you want me to take away from the poison

I get Loquito when I eat a Pasti
Before I was alone and now I am with Nefertiti
Your eyes are shrinking when you smoke a lot
This goes for you Khaleesi

I get Loquito when I eat a Pasti
Before I was alone and now I am with Nefertiti
Your eyes are shrinking when you smoke a lot
This goes for you Khaleesi
You might also like I put Loquito when I eat a Pasti
Before I was alone and now I am with Nefertiti
Your eyes are shrinking when you smoke a lot
This goes for you Khaleesi

Gloveing ​​rhythms as if it were Nicki's ass
