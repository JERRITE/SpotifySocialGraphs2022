Replay the Moment LyricsLike an all star, top ten ending
Fake left, step back and I went in
No, Can't handle my handle
3 point shot ,and won't blow the whistle
Hey, it was a journey but I made it
Now it's time for celebration
Hard work and dedication, no intimidation
Talk about greatness

Replay the moment, I know I owned it
I took the shot , I beat the clock
Scored in slow motion (in slow motion)
Replay the moment (what?)
Over and over
Now I'm on top ( on top), can't be stopped
And you can quote it , so replay the moment

Now everybody say win,win (win, win)
Spitz, Spitz ( Spitz,Spitz)
Win, win ( win,win)
Spitz, Spitz( Spitz,Spitz)

Replay the moment, I know I owned it
I took the shot , I beat the clock
Scored in slow motion
Replay the moment
Over and over
Now I'm on top, I can't be stopped
And you can quote it , so replay the moment
Yeah, I know I owned it (owned it)

I took the shot , I beat the clock
Scored in slow motion (in slow motion)
Replay the moment
Over and over ( and over)
Now I'm on top, I can't be stopped
And you can quote it , so replay the momentYou might also likeEmbed
