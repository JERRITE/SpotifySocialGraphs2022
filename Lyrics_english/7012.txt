Plastic Plants Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna love you like in movies
A ticket for two, please
You could've been that man
If this was really showbiz, you would give me roses
And I would take your hand, ah
Hollywood made it look easy
Why'd it have to tease me?
I don't understand
I tried to love like in the movies
But, all I got was plastic plants
(All I got was plastic plants)
(All I got was plastic plants)
[Chorus]
I've got something inside me
That I wanna confess (Wanna confess)
You've been cutting your ties and
I don't wanna be next (Wanna be next)
I've (I've) got (Got) something inside me
That (That) I (I) wanna confess (Wanna confess)
If your roses are dead and your violets ain't true
I don't wanna grow next to you

[Verse 2]
I thought that our love would be a series
Always have you near me
Yeah, that was the plan
You were meant to call me on the daily
Link me like a daisy chain upon my hand
Hollywood made me think it was simple
I took it too literal
Now I understand, huh
I thought you were growing up
Thought we'd have a real romance, huh (Thought we would)
But all I got was plastic plants

[Chorus]
I've got something inside me
That I wanna confess (Wanna confess)
You've been cutting your ties and
I don't wanna be next (Wanna be next)
I've (I've) got (Got) something inside me
That (That) I (I) wanna confess (Wanna confess)
If your roses are dead and your violets ain't true
I don't wanna grow next to you
You might also like[Bridge]
You're gonna know what you did when I don't holla back, babe
Look at me (Look at me)
I was your girl, but you never gave me jack, babe
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Now we've grown apart (Yeah, huh)
Didn't even try, so the love ran dry
Now we're back at the start
You had your chance, you just gave me plastic plants

[Chorus]
I've got something inside me
That I wanna confess (Wanna confess)
You've been cutting your ties and
I don't wanna be next (Wanna be next)
I've (I've) got (Got) something inside me
That (That) I (I) wanna confess (Wanna confess)
If your roses are dead and your violets ain't true
I don't wanna grow next to you (Baby, uh)

[Outro]
Next to you, next to you, babe, ha2Embed
