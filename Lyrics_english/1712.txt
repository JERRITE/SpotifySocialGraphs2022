Unravel Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's something in the sun or the air
It's making me want to run away from here
I know that you want me to stay with you, but no
So I'll keep on making excuses about the sun, the earth, the rays

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Our days are numbered
Wired, and I'm tired of it
I know you're trying, but you'll never unravel me
[Chorus]
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel

[Verse 2]
It's something about the season that we're in
(We're in, we're in, we're in, we're in)
That's making me think that we're not supposed to do this
I know that you're trying to understand, but you can't
'Cause I keep on making excuses about the fall, the rise

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And how my mind is ruptured
Wired, and I'm tired of it
I know you're trying, but you'll never unravel me

[Chorus]
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel

[Outro]
Unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravel
Unravel me, unravelYou might also like13Embed
