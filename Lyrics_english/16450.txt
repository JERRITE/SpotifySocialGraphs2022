Invisible - Single Version LyricsYou've got me so confused and there's words I could use
But I'm afraid to say them
I feel I've been had and I'm boiling mad
Still I can't live without you
You don't have the time and you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me
Oh, you don't know I exist and I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Invisible, you treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt
You do the worst
You just don't care how much it hurts
I can never reach ya on the phone
It rings and rings when I know you're home
It may be naive but I just wanna believe
I'm the only one
I tell myself lies and give you alibies
Knowin' your promises you'll never keep
Like the merry go round I'm goin' up, goin' down
I'm on a dead end street
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Although, I know it's not a lot
Don't want to lose whatever we've got
I keep hangin' on, knowin' I can't win
'Cause it's too hard to start over again
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisible
You treat me like I'm not really there
And you don't really care
I know this romance, it ain't goin' nowhere
Invisible, you treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt, you do the worst
You just don't care how much it hurts
Invisible, I feel like I'm invisibleYou might also likeEmbed
