The Keeper Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wander through these dreams, dreams you keep
I was lost but now, now I see
You bring light and dark, dark undone
The sea that floods is love, love someone

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, you are the keeper
I could swear my heart won't break in time
My love runs deeper
Let's spend this life as one
Until we're bones
[Verse 2]
I am blessed by skies, skies of blue
If you knew how I feel, feel for you
Catch me when I fall, fall from grace
Tear down all my walls, walls they break

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, you are the keeper
I could swear my heart won't break in time
My love runs deeper
Let's spend this life as one
Until we're bones

[Bridge]
I'll hold you, I'll kiss you, I'll stone for you, I'll miss you
I'll hold you, I'll kiss you, I'll stone for you, I'll miss you
I'll hold you, I'll kiss you, I'll stone for you, I'll miss you
I'll hold you, I'll kiss you, I'll stone for you, I'll miss you

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, you are the keeper
I could swear my heart won't break in time
My love runs deeper
Let's spend this life as one
Until we're bones
You might also like[Outro]
Until we're bones
Until we're bones
Until we're bones
Until we're bones
(You are the keeper) Until we're bones
(My love runs deeper) Until we're bones
(You are the keeper) Until we're bones
(My love runs deeper)2Embed
