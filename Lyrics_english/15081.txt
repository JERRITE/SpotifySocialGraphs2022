Dickeye Lyrics[intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Once 'round outside and check the door
Only thing he came here lookin' for
One man wasting another man
One hand washes the other hand

[Chorus]
Born traitor
Born traitor
Born traitor
Soul fader
[Verse 2]
Stoplight flashes in the street
Injected concrete hide bloody feet
Armed and shining in his hands
Cold metallic green, he don't give a damn

[Bridge]
One man wasting another man
One hand washes the other hand
One man wasting another man
One hand washes the other hand

[Chorus]
Born traitor
Born traitor
Born traitor
Soul fader

[Verse 3]
Down come the hammer, fall my god, you say
Once again the big dog has his day
One man wasting another man
One hand washes the other hand

[Chorus]
Born traitor
Born traitor
Born traitor
Soul fader
You might also like[Outro]
One man wasting another man
Born traitor
One hand washes the other hand
Born traitor
One man wasting another man
Born traitor
One hand washes the other hand
Soul faderEmbed
