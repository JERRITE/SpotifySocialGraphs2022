What Do You See In Me? Lyrics[Verse 1]
One night without booze and I wake up with a head cold
One night without you and I wake drenched in sweat
It's like someone took away this little boy's ice cream
And I'm so much colder when I'm without it

[Chorus]
I can't see the connection but I know there's one there
So I'm asking you honey: do you really care about me?

[Verse 2]
When you're around it's like life really matters
Where once I was restless now I'm content
There's no meat on the bone but this dog isn't hungry
And what does it mean when I won't jump the fence?
[Chorus]
I know there's a reason for why I must be
So I'm asking you honey do you really care about me?
What do you see in me?

[Bridge]
It all feels too easy, it all seems so strange
I've already forgotten how I used to pray
For someone like you
I'd be down on my knees

[Verse 3]
I'd like to think we could go on forever
Yeah the thought of you leaving me hurts my head
But science cannot answer the laws of attraction
And science can't say what happens when we're dead

[Chorus]
There's so much they don't know
So much they can't see
They're so full of questions ...
While I'm down on my knees
'cause there's only one question that honestly matters to me
What do you see in me?
