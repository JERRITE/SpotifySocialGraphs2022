Humongous Lyrics[Intro]
Dec, what do you think about the car? Do you like it?
I think it's really good, and now I'm gonna sing my new album now

[Verse 1]
Don't tag me along to your show, to your broadcast
I know, I'm good at letting go
And then tag me along with your rules, with your promise
I swear you spend too much time on your phone and on your hair

[Chorus]
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair
That I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair
That I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
[Verse 2]
Don't tell me I'm not, I'm not smart or I'm not worthy
I know, I couldn't let that go
And then tag me along with your hate and with your envy
I swear to God I cannot take you anywhere

[Chorus]
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair
That I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair
That I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?

[Chorus]
Do you care?
I'm big, humongous, enormous and small
And it's not fair
That I am nothing and nobody's there
Do you care?
Do you care?

[Verse 3]
Godspeed, up
Slowpoke, it's peak
I'm gonna throw up
Well, baby, when will you grow up?
You've been such a joke this week
You think you're funny
When you're talking all loud and your nose is all runnyYou might also like20Embed
