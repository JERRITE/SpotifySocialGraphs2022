Falling in love with you Lyrics [lyrics by "Falling me in you"]

Because, looking at you, I always get lost in your eyes
I can't help it, I'm addicted to you
With your smile, I just blushed
I dream of your mouth, crimson color

And without you, I swear, I can go crazy
I want to feel your whole skin
Come with me, just a little while
You know how much I dream of you
I swear, I'm going to love you
Forever, I will give you everything
I want to take care of you, everything gives you
Dartе my life, a star to get off

Oyеme, Miss
Now that you are alone
I want to give you everything
That you are my spoiled

I will be your company
The one who gives you joy
If you want to be my girlfriend
Come, give me a smile

Tell me if you want to escape
You know I love you, I can't hide it
Come, Mamacita, Ponte Cerquita
I want to bite that beautiful little mouth

That since I saw you
I knew you were for me
I no longer endure the desire
To be with you

If I told you, pretty
Oh, that the desire kill me
To be with you
You Might Also like that without you, I swear, I can go crazy
I want to feel your whole skin
Come with me, just a little while
You know how much I dream of you

I swear, I'm going to love you
Forever, I will give you everything
I want to take care of you, everything gives you
Give you my life, a star download you

Hear me, lady
Now that you are alone
I want to give you everything
That you are my spoiled

I will be your company
The one who gives you joy
If you want to be my girlfriend
Come, give me a smile

Hear me, lady
Now that you are alone
I want to give you everything
That you are my spoiled

I will be your company
The one who gives you joy
If you want to be my girlfriend
Come, give me a smileembed
