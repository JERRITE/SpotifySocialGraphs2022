I'm here lyrics ["I'm here"]

[Verse 1]
I know you won't come, everything that was
Time left him behind, I know you won't return
What happened to us not repeat ever
A thousand years will not be enough to erase you and forget

[Pre-car]
And now I'm here wanting to convert
The fields in city, mixing the sky with the sea
I know I let you escape, I know I lost you
Nothing can be the same
A thousand years can reach (a thousand years can reach)
So you can forgive
[Chorus]
I'm here loving you, drowning
Between photos and notebooks, between things and memories
I can't understand
I'm going crazy
Changing a foot for my face
Tonight for the day, and what?
I can do nothing

[Verse 2]
The letters I wrote, I never sent them
Don't want to know about me
I can't understand the fool I was
It is a matter of time and faith
A thousand years with another thousand years (a thousand years with another thousand)
Are enough to love

[Chorus]
I'm here loving you, drowning
Between photos and notebooks, between things and memories
I can't understand
I'm going crazy
Changing a foot for my face
Tonight for the day, and what?
I'm here loving you, drowning
Between photos and notebooks, between things and memories that
I'm going crazy
Changing a foot for my face
Tonight for the day, and what?

If you still think about something
You know I'm still waiting for you

[Chorus]
I'm here loving you, drowning
Between photos and notebooks, between things and memories that
I'm going crazy
Changing a foot for my face
Tonight for the day, and what?
I'm here loving you, drowning
Between photos and notebooks, between things and memories that
I'm going crazy
Changing a foot for my face
Tonight for the day, and what?

[Outro]
(I'm here loving you)
I'm here
(I'm going crazy)
(I'm here loving you, drowning)
Crazy
(I'm going crazy) 2embed
