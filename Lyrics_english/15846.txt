I deal and I can't get lyrics [letter of "treatment and I can't" get "]

[Intro]
Epa!
Treatment and I can't get
Ay-ay-ay-AY!

[Verse 1]
Not so long ago
That we are in a bar
You talked about yesterday
I wanted to kiss you
You looked at me strangely
As if he had done wrong
Forgive me, woman
I really love you
[Pre-car]
And I'm dying between the hours
That passing and you ignore me
I would swear that you are alone
And that my kisses seem

[Chorus]
Treatment and I can't get
I can't stand another day
I'm dying to see you
Be with you
I insist so many times
But I don't give up
Drive of your pride
It's time to change
Let's live this love
Do not lose a second
That happiness awaits you in the future

[Verse 2]
Time has passed by your side
And I always want more
You are what I asked for
Of heaven for me
I miss you so much
And I wonder, where will you walk?
And I don't want to think
That there is another in my place
You Might Also Like [Pre-Coro]
And I'm dying between the hours
That passing and you ignore me
I would swear that you are alone
And that my kisses seem

[Chorus]
Treatment and I can't get
I can't stand another day
I'm dying to see you
Be with you
I insist so many times
But I don't give up
Drive of your pride
It's time to change
Let's live this love
Do not lose a second
That happiness awaits you in the future

[Chorus]
Oh oh! treatment and I can't get
I can't stand another day
I'm dying to see you
Be with you
I insist so many times
But I don't give up
Drive of your pride
It's time to change
Let's live this love
Do not lose a second
That happiness awaits you in the future
[Bridge]
Let's go!
Noriega and Cabas
Let's go to those who can
Those who cannot, go pa'lante
Do not fuck!

[Chorus]
Treatment and I can't get
I can't stand another day
I'm dying to see you
Be with you
I insist so many times
But I don't give up
