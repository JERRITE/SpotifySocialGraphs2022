Dark Out Lyrics[Chorus: Global Dan & AzN]
I know you only want to see me when it's dark out
I know you're sad but why you mad I'm in my bag now
Yeah I'm a star going far, foreign cars now
You see my riding 'round the city with my top down
Balenciaga on me every time I walk out
I know I'm hard, shut it down with my guitar now
Yeah I'm a star, foreign car going hard now
You wanna play me, I'ma make you eat your heart out

[Verse 1: Global Dan & AzN]
I-Iced out shawty say that I'm nice (Ice)
See it then I cop it, I don't worry 'bout the price
Now they see me and I'm popping, they don't know the sacrifice
She 'bout her business by the day, but she be freaky by the night, yeah
On sight, tell me what you like, put you on a flight
I got sprite, purple in the ice, we could do it right
Living life
Celebrating with the gang and we gon' turn up every night
Don't overthink it, shawty, you know I'ma have you feeling right
Ayy, look at the way that I do this, uh
You hated on me, need to cool it
I'ma keep winning no time to be losing, uh
Only see me when I'm cruising, uh
Shawty want me, she be goosing, uh
Givenchy, Gabbana I know that you want it
Come fuck with me but I be choosing, yuh
[Chorus: Global Dan & AzN]
I know you only want to see me when it's dark out (See me when it's dark)
I know you're sad but why you mad I'm in my bag now
Yeah I'm a star going far, foreign cars now
You see my riding 'round the city with my top down
Balenciaga on me every time I walk out (Yeah)
I know I'm hard, shut it down with my guitar now
Yeah I'm a star, foreign car going hard now
You wanna play me, I'ma make you eat your heart out (Ah, ayy)

[Verse 2: Global Dan]
I know you prolly want that Global Dan I used to be
If you don't like it, then it's okay, you gon' get used to me
I'm running up onto my enemies
I don't need nobody, no friend to me
Better get up out the way, when I'm on the way
'Bout to make a play, money looking like a centipede
Like, open her mouth then I'm going in
I'm 'bout to pull out and I'm flowing in
Flowing, I gotta continue the motion
You blowing, you love it
I know that you know it, like whoa
Remember when all of them telling me I wouldn't make it but look at me now (Now)
I need me a shawty that love me, that want me, that really be holding me down, whoa
Cannot slow (Yeah), get up and I go (Yeah)
I remember when I woke up my wallet on broke
I remember everybody sleeping now they woke (Yeah)
Bitches, they calling my name, they want me don't want me to go

I know you only want to see me when it's dark out (See me when it's dark)
I know you're sad but why you mad I'm in my bag now
Yeah I'm a star going far, foreign cars now
You see my riding 'round the city with my top down
Balenciaga on me every time I walk out (Yeah)
I know I'm hard, shut it down with my guitar now
Yeah I'm a star, foreign car going hard now
You wanna play me, I'ma make you eat your heart out, wow11Embed
