The touch of love Lyricstoc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know if I should say goodbye
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know whether or not

I have so much time
Time without your body
I can't imagine another being happy
As at your side I was
(Princess)
Today I feel confused
I feel lost in this empty
Since that day you told me goodbye
I can't repeat it
I don't want a game.
A heart that has stayed
Without wanting to love
A heart that no longer believes
What do you give me is real
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know if I should say goodbye
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know whether or not

Suddenly arrived
And so subtly, I feel this again
Again, I didn't look for it
And it gets straight ahead
The light of my love is still intermittent
Love touches me with other eyes
With another mouth, my body trembles
And my soul that explodes
I don't know what I hope if you don't care
No longer oh no

Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know if I should say goodbye
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know whether or not
You might also like I love so long
Time without your body
I can't imagine another being happy
As at your side I was
Today I feel confused
I feel lost in this empty
Since that day you told me goodbye
I can't repeat it
I don't want a game.
A heart that has stayed
Without wanting to love
A heart that no longer believes
What do you give me is real

Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know if I should say goodbye
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know whether or not

I am so afraid to give myself again
That raising course will hurt me
But strange those moments
Without your company amazing nights
No matter the pain
I want to feel like before
Enter my heart
But they are so exciting
He said he loved me but he was so distant
Suffered loneliness every day is so pulsating
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know if I should say goodbye
Toc touc at the door I play
Love again
I don't know whether to let it in
I don't know whether or not

Yeah! Dragon and Knight
With feet on the ground
But looking at the sky
We do the perfect balance
You know what i mean!
