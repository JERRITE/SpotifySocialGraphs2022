I Won’t Let You Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
When it feels like surgery
And it burns like third degree
And you wonder what is it worth?
When your inside's breaking in
And you feel that ache again
And you wonder what's giving birth?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you could let the pain of the past go
Of your soul
None of this is in your control
[Chorus]
If you could only let your guard down
If you could learn to trust me somehow
Well I swear, that I won't let you go
If you could only let go your doubts
If you could just believe in me now
I swear, that I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Verse 2]
When your fear is currency
And you feel that urgency
You want peace but there's war in your head
Maybe that's where life is born
When our façades are torn
Pain gives birth to the promise ahead, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you could let the pain of the past go
Of your soul
None of this is in your control

[Chorus]
If you could only let your guard down
If you could learn to trust me somehow
Well I swear, that I won't let you go
If you could only let go your doubts
If you could just believe in me now
I swear, that I won't let you go

I won't let you go
I'll always be by your side, yeah

[Chorus]
If you could only let your guard down
If you could learn to trust me somehow
I swear, that I won't let you go
If you could only let go your doubts
If you could just believe in me now
I swear, that I won't let you go
I won't let you go

[Interlude]
(I won't let you go)
I won't let you go
(I won't let you go)

[Outro]
There ain't no darkness strong enough that could tear you out from my heart (I won't let you go)
There ain't no strength that's strong enough that could tear this love apart (I won't let you go)
Yeah, there ain't no darkness strong enough that could tear you out from my heart
Yeah, there ain't no strength that's strong enough that could tear this love apart
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go
No, I won't let you go2Embed
