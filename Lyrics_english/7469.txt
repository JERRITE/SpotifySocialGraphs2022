Someoneâ€™s Watching Over Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Found myself today
Oh, I found myself and ran away
Something pulled me back
The voice of reason I forgot I had
All I know is you're not here to say
What you always used to say
But it's written in the sky tonight

[Chorus]
So I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark
I'll still believe someone's watching over me
[Verse 2]
Seen that ray of light and it's shining on my destiny
Shining all the time
And I won't be afraid to follow everywhere it's taking me
All I know is yesterday is gone
And right now I belong to this moment to my dreams

[Chorus]
So I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark
I'll still believe someone's watching over me

[Bridge]
It doesn't matter what people say
And it doesn't matter how long it takes
Believe in yourself and you'll fly high
And it only matters how true you are
Be true to yourself and follow your heart

[Chorus]
So, I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark
I'll still believe that I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even when it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark
I'll still believe that someone's watching over
Someone's watching over
Someone's watching over me
Someone's watching over meYou might also like2Embed
