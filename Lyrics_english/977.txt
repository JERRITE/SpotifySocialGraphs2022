For you Lyrics [letter from "for you"]

[Intro: Jay Wheeler]
Oh oh
YEAH-YEIH
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I have seen that in love you have not had luck (luck)
And what is hard for you to trust
I have seen that you fall in love with different men
But none could replace me
I know you still sleep with the light on
Because you fear the darkness
And when you go out with your friends
You talk about me, you can't help it
[Pre-car: Jay Wheeler]
You lie if you tell me
What did you forget when we were happy
No one is going to love you as I did
You become strong and you haven't erased scars

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler]
Tell me the truth
Now who opens the door when you feel loneliness?
Tell me who, tell me who
And in your intimacy you are looking for an answer, but
When love goes
The wounds stay

[Verse 1: Jay Wheeler]
Time has passed and I wish you luck
Even if you don't believe me, I don't want to see you anymore
I also thought that now e 'forever
But with alcohol I took you from my mind eh-eh
You lie when you say that fixing what I never wanted
You knew everything I did for you
But to shit, that's what you promised

[Chorus: Alex Rose]
Tell me the truth
Now who opens the door when you feel loneliness?
Tell me who, tell me who
And in your intimacy you are looking for an answer, but
When love goes
The wounds stay

I know you feel alone
And you don't trust anyone
And while the hours spend
The details hurt you more
Those errors of the past were fragmented
Everything went to shit when they cheated you
And I gave myself without knowing that
You had a debt and I paid it
Who is going to tell you "I love you" how I did?
Sing songs in poetry
In all my plans I included you
Without knowing what you fled

[Choir: Jay Wheeler & Alex Rose]
Tell me the truth
Now who opens the door when you feel loneliness?
Tell me who, tell me who
In your intimacy you are looking for an answer, but
When love goes
The wounds stay

[Outro: Jay Wheeler]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm-mmmembed
