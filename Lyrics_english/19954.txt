S500 Lyrics [Songetxt to "S500"]

[Intro]
MGP

[Hook]
Bitches drip in 'a S500 (EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500
Bitches drip in 'a S500 (EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk (yes)
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500
[Part 1]
The car no longer yellow, but knows how the smoke
I don't need anything at the moment, I climb up (yes)
People scream now "Where is there something like that?"
Under 25 in Benzer like a business opa
Thank god, I'm happy yes (ey)
Because I don't sit in the Skoda, I don't sit in the Fiat, I don't sit in the Kia (no, no)
I don't drive cars that I borrowed somewhere '
I come with the Sch√∂nlingslache in the premier class
So please say the bitch should let the nonsense
I have too many DMS, no time for a little mouse (no time)
Mgpimp, baby, tell me who needs a pipe

[Hook]
Bitches drip in 'NEM S500 (500, EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk (cash)
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500
Bitches drip in 'a S500 (EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk (yes)
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500

[Part 2]
400PS is what I need on the street
Workshop No.5, do the exhaust system
With the Breitbauer body kit, shit on a celebrity bitch
Because they are painted like corpses in a zombie film
Your account not covered, fuck the Volvo from your'm dad
I am MGP, every Otto comes with rap
At 200 in the city, because I shit on the laws
This bass comes from the sunroof, like Trevor only the best
There is no V+for me, only V8
In 'a v8 I put your wife flat
Bitches are waiting for my casting couch
Until I ancestor 'with the party sound
You might so like [Hook]
Bitches drip in 'a S500 (EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500
Bitches drip in 'a S500 (EY)
Money is bunkered in the trunk (yes)
Too fast, I was surprised myself (EY)
On the way with the S500EMBed
