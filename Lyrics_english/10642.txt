Ion Like You Lyrics[Hook]
You can't hang with the gang bitch, we don't like you
Savage, I'm such a bad bitch, I could fight too (What up?)
Pullin' up with dracos ain't no tellin' what we might do
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm ridin', you know slidin' I'm  if Ion like you

[Verse 1]
You ain't gang sis, stay in your lane you not tough
You know Molly, I ain't never gave a fuck
Step out on a bitch and get it poppin' like a pill
Still the same dawg, I'm just countin' more hunnid dollar bills
All these dusty lil' hoes keep my name in they mouth
Slide to your hood hoe, I'm coming to your house
Run off in your crib if you say you ain't comin' out
It's easy to talk that shit without this pistol in your mouth
All that tweetin' bout beefin' you a mothfuckin' rat
Now none them bitches you with got your motherfuckin' back
They see us they gon' run like it's motherfuckin' track
Ridin' 'round the city with the draco on my lap
[Hook]
You can't hang with the gang bitch, we don't like you
Savage, I'm such a bad bitch, I could fight too
Pullin' up with dracos ain't no tellin' what we might do
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm ridin', you know slidin' I'm  if Ion like you

[Verse 2]
I dare you to say my name hoe, you a lame hoe
You think that we don't know you still that you still the same hoe
Never gettin' paper, bum bitch we know you still broke
Chagin' on your niggas that's that shit you could get killed for
I'm ridin', I'm my own shooter
Just need a driver
A savage, you not 'bout that life we know you lyin'
I'm slidin' when it come to beef, nigga you dyin'
Circle your block, lookin' for a opp bitch you hidin'
Old bum ass bitch
I ain't takin' no shit from a crumb ass bitch
Fighting Molly is you tweakin'? Old dumb ass bitch
When you see me in these streets, we gon run that shit

[Hook]
You can't hang with the gang bitch, we don't like you
Savage, I'm such a bad bitch, I could fight too
Pullin' up with dracos ain't no tellin' what we might do
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm slidin', you know I'm ridin' if Ion like you
Ion like you bitch, Ion like you
I'm ridin', you know slidin' I'm  if Ion like youYou might also likeEmbed
