The Dembow Lyrics sounds [lyrics of "the dembow"]

[Intro: Joey Montana & Sebastián Yatra]
Joey
How it happened? I dont know
If in my plans I had no fall in love (Ey, Yeah)
Yatra, Yatra
But I saw you so
And how did I come alone
I did not think
And I decided to approach you
[Pre-Caro: Joey Montana & Sebastián Yatra]
When I saw you, I saw, I saw
I knew you were for me, me, me
And I like you only you, you, you
We have things in common, Baby
When I saw you, I saw, I saw
I knew you were for me, me, me
And I like you only you, you, you
We have things in common

[Chorus: Joey Montana & Sebastián Yatra]
I knew because you are like me
You like to dance when the dembow sounds
(Soning the Dembow sounds)
The night is good and dancing with you
Gets better (OH-OH)
I knew because you are like me
You like to dance when the dembow sounds
(Soning the Dembow sounds)
The night is good and dancing with you
It gets better

[Verse 1: Joey Montana]
(Joey)
I left the aimless street (Yeah, Yeah)
I wasn't in my plans to fall in love with you
But not a second happened
You entered my world (and what?), And in your eyes I lost myself
Baby, I don't know how you got into my head
But finally I found my princess
The one who knows how to dominate me when he kisses me (Muah)
Sing the choir that starts again
