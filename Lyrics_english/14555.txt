Ya Hilwe (Dance With Me Now) | يا حلوة LyricsYa albe ya Hilwe
You stole my heart away
Habibi ya Hilwe
Dance with me now

She don't have to be up in the spotlight
And she never needed nobody else
Type of girl that will give you a good life
Acting like a shy girl but I can tell
Stimulate my mind when she play around
Shordy is a fine one it’s clear to me
Show me what you got when i come around
And When i come around
Let your body speak
You're the only one I want you know
So come on put your loving on me
And let mе see you
Wine up on Me ya wine up on Mе ya

[Sandy Part] (Arabic)
