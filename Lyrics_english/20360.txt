Thoughts of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I'm cruisin' down ocean
My mind is producin' thoughts of you
Hearin' these rumors, prayin', hopin' that they not true
Sayin' you different, but knowin' that you fuck with the crew
Drinkin' this liquor, tryin' to forget about you
These sober thoughts made me realize that you broke many hearts
And I can say "You the reason why I turned into a dog"
Time is the only solution to mend a broken heart
You may be down for the moment
But trust me, don't lose focus
But can you tell me why these dreams are something I'm provokin'?
And while I think about it, there's some other nigga out there strokin'
You give them everything they ask, then they leave you broken
They use you for a game, like an arcade token
So many hearts is broken and so many words are spoken
I lift one finger to the sky, I hope this prayer's workin'
My mind's been playin' games and I can see the devil lurkin'
I want the money and the fame, so when they sleepin'-
[Chorus]
I be workin'
I be learnin'
I be earnin'
Table's turnin'
Disconcernin'
I stay determined, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be workin'
I be learnin'
I be earnin'
Table's turnin'
Disconcernin'
I stay determined, yeah

[Verse 2]
Who can you love?
Who can you trust?
Twenty seventeen
You hate the fact that he played you, I feel he sold your dreams
One day he love you, the next day that nigga switchin' scenes
But you stick with him 'cause you convinced that it's meant to be
He say he love you, he want you, and that's all you gon' see
He played you good, no he's not who he pretends to be
On different teams but you convinced that we all the same
You wanna love him but you remember 'bout all the pain
He fucked you over and lately you just don't feel the same
Drinkin' all night 'cause when you sober you feel nothin' but pain
I know you tired of givin' love to these fuckin' lames
Seems like no matter what I tell you, you think I'm the same
Been through a lot so I'm not really into playin' games
Know how I felt from the beginning, I won't ever change
I took my shot with you, I missed but girl I'm here to stay
I'm workin' day and night to make sure that I'm gettin' paid
You might also like[Chorus]
I be workin'
I be learnin'
I be earnin'
Table's turnin'
Disconcernin'
I stay determined, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be workin'
I be learnin'
I be earnin'
Table's turnin'
Disconcernin'
I stay determinedEmbed
