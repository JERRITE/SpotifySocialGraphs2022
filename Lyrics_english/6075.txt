Good Luck Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, the face
The face of evil's on the news tonight
We see the darkness over light
But have we ever really lived in better times?
Hey, strange
They say we're coming to the end of the line
But is there still a chance to change your mind?
Or have all the colors turned to black and white?

[Verse 2]
I had another dream, I had another life
No one saw the blood on my hands
When I woke, I was there alone
Where will it end?
After the twilight, always a sunrise
But the glow of morning comes with small arms fire
Ignore the deadline, there's no divine right
Enter the gods and all the sacred signs
At the end of your line
[Chorus]
Good luck, my friend
In time, it ends
Heads up, dead man
My heart, your hands
Good luck, my friend
In time, it ends
Heads up, dead man
My heart, your handsYou might also like3Embed
