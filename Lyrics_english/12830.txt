Misfits T-Shirt Lyrics[Intro]
Fell in love with the girl in a Misfits t-shirt
It fucks me up every time that I think I see her

[Verse 1]
I was on my own doing my thing
Whatever I wanted, nobody bothering me
I would share my fate, but it never meant much
It never had feeling, it only had touch
And then it hit me
[Pre-Chorus]
Out of the blue I saw her dressed in all black
She turned around and there was no turning back

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the girl in a Misfits t-shirt
It fucks me up every time that I think I see her
I know it's wrong but I feel like I still need her
I fell in love with the girl in a Misfits t-shirt

[Verse 2]
And now I'm losing sleep 'cause I can't let go
It's like I'm being haunted by a crimson ghost
Don't let it get me

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of the blue I saw her dressed in all black
She turned around and there was no turning back

[Chorus]
I fell in love with a girl in a Misfits t-shirt
It fucks me up every time that I think I see her
I know it's wrong but I feel like I still need her
I fell in love with the girl in a Misfits t-shirt

[Bridge]
I was on my own doing my thing
Whatever I wanted, nobody bothering me
And then it hit me

[Outro]
I fell in love with the girl in a Misfits T-shirt
It fucks me up every time that I think I see her
I know it's wrong but I feel like I still need her
I fell in love with the girl in a Misfits T-shirt3Embed
