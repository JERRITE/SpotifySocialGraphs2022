Love at first sight Lyrics [Lyrics for "Love at first sight" ft. Horacio Palencia]

[Intro: Belinda]
UH, UH-UH, UH-UH, UH

UH-UH, UH-UH-UH, UH, UH

[Verse 1: Belinda & Horacio Palencia]
I saw you pass with your angel face
And ruby ​​eyes, smile of a brilliant
I followed you, I don't know, my instinct took me to you
I arrived at the bar, I asked for a strong tequila
To start
I saw you with your friends, I approached
Under the pretext of inviting you to dance
[Pre-car: Belinda]
The song that sounded promised to enjoy
BODYER, YOU AND I, THE TWO KEEP
I told you in your ear: "I like you"
And I want you to come with me tonight

[Chorus: Belinda & Horacio Palencia]
And take, next to you, the morning coffee
Wake up with kisses, pleased on my bed
And look at your face, your smiling face
That people know, that I love you and that you love me
Without thinking about the past or present
I don't care, love, know where you come from
If I am the first or the last on your list
I know well that it is love at first sight

[Bridge: Belinda]
UH, UH-UH, UH-UH, UH
UH-UH, UH-UH, UH
UH-UH, UH-UH-UH, UH, UH

[Verse 2: Belinda]
I am leaving for today, but maybe tomorrow I will come back
And hopefully we will see each other
Because with you I have had a great time
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro: Belinda]
As much as I wanted, I did not dare to say
"Don't go, by God, stay, please"
I told you in your ear: "I like you"
And I want you to sleep with me tonight

[Chorus: Belinda & Horacio Palencia]
And take, next to you, the morning coffee
Wake up with kisses, pleased on my bed
And look at your face, your smiling face
That people know, that I love you and that you love me
Without thinking about the past or present
I don't care, love, know where you come from
If I am the first or the last on your list
I know well that it is love at first sight

[Verse 3: Lalo Ebratt]
L-a-l-o
Past tread, girl
Rico was to see you again
But more happens to me, I saw your photo on the Internet
Everything, everything really, that you have everything
Fashion and rebel with fashion
Maybe it was destiny (destiny), I want to see you again
All on my way (you), like that sunset
It usually happens, love is blind, you can never see
[Chorus: Horacio Palencia & Belinda]
Without thinking about the past or present
I don't care, love, know where you come from
If I'm the first or last on your list
I know well that it is love at first sight

[Outro: Belinda & Elías "El Doc" Mejía]
UH, UH-UH, UH-UH, UH
From Iztapalapa for the world
UH-UH, UH-UH, UH
The blue Angels

Love, love, love (UH, UH-UH, UH-UH, UH)
Love, love, love (UH-UH, UH-UH, UH)
Love, love, love (UH-UH, UH-UH-UH, UH, UH)
