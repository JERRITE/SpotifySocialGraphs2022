​days go bye Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, days go by
These days all I'm trying to know is who I am
Don't know why
It's been hard for me to stay in one place
Yeah, days go by
I've been trying to run away from what I know
And I don't know where I'm going
But I do know why (Alright)

[Verse 1]
Got a Backwood rolled full of big old smoke
Got a house full of friends, gotta keep 'em close
Got big old eyes for the things I want
And a voice in my head telling me I don't, yeah (Yeah)
But right now I'm trying to make it to the morning
I got one more on me if you want it
And right now I'm just living in the moment we have (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Yeah, days go by
These days all I'm trying to know is who I am
Don't know why
It's been hard for me to stay in one placе
Yeah, days go by
I've been trying to run away from what I know
And I don't know wherе I'm going
But I do know why

[Verse 2]
I've been looking up, I've been looking down (Yeah)
Even went to parties, trying to look around
Hit the bottom of a cup, trying not to drown, yeah
Thinking I'm getting tired of the running 'round, yeah
'Cause none of it hit like it used to, baby, nah
None of it hit like it used to, yeah
None of it hit like it used to, baby, nah
None of it hits like it used to (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, days go by
These days all I'm trying to know is who I am
Don't know why
It's been hard for me to stay in one place
Yeah, days go by
I've been trying to run away from what I know
And I don't know where I'm going
But I do know why
You might also like[Bridge]
For the first time, I'm not thinking 'bout last time
Feels good to know, yeah, baby
For the first time, I'm not thinking 'bout last time
And I know I've been gone, but I'm coming home

[Chorus]
Yeah, days go by
These days all I'm trying to know is who I am
Don't know why
It's been hard for me to stay in one place
Yeah, days go by
I've been trying to run away from what I know
And I don't know where I'm going
But I do know why (Yeah)

[Outro]
The days go byEmbed
