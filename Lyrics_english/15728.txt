You no longer miss me (Luck ra remix) Lyrics [letter of "no longer strange" ft. LUCK RA]

[Pre-stribe: Rusher King]
Where are you? Do you think of me?
I want to know if you still love me
And where are you going? I'm here
Waiting for you, why does it take you?

[Chorus: Rusher King, Luck ra]
You don't miss me how I miss you and I'm afraid
That you forget the "I love you" and the "I love you"
And I have so many kisses that I didn't even give you (I didn't even give you)
And I have so many kisses that they were pa 'ti (were pa' ti)
And now I think of you and although time passes I realize that you are not pa 'mi (and you go)
[Verse: luck ra]
You were not my first, nor I first
But you were and you are the only one I want
I hope our problems are passengers because without you I can't
I swear that my mistakes are fixing them
I know you're not going to be all your life waiting
Hopefully another person is not advancing
I just want to recover what he had released before
And you leave (far), I just want to find a solution
And you leave (far), I can't admit that this time was my mistake
And you leave (far), it could be with thousands, but not
And you leave (far), the time will tell who of the two was the one who lost

[Chorus: Luck ra, Rusher King]
You don't miss me how I miss you and I'm afraid
That you forget the "I love you" and the "I love you"
And no matter how much you get away from me (you get away from me)
And give you what I didn't give you (everything I didn't give you)
You know you are not going to get someone to look like me

[Bridge: Rusher King, Luck ra]
And I neglected you, huh
And apparently, huh, I moved away so much, woman, who is now difficult for me to come back
I don't have your love anymore, I don't have your heat anymore
I only have your hatred (for not deciding and being a loser)

You don't miss me how I miss you and I'm afraid
That you forget the "I love you" and the "I love you"
And I have so many kisses that I didn't even give you
And I have so many kisses that they were pa 'ti
Now I think of you and although time passes I realize that you are not pa 'mi (and you leave)
