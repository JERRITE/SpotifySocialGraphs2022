TREETIME

[Chorus: Powfu]
Yeah
It's your fault that this turned out bad (This turned out bad)
It's your fault that you thought we had something (You thought we had something)
It's your fault that you hate me now (You hate me now)
I told you that I'm good for nothing

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah
I been good for nothing for too long (Too long)
I say it's bout time I get a move on (A move on)
Tried to hide my heart but you stole it (You stole it)
You saw all the signs, but you dove in (you dove in)
Saw your eyes and I knew that I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Talked that night and I couldn't jump the puddle
Started off fine, until you got to know me
Wasted my time, guess I'm meant to be lonely
Meant to be lonely
Guess I'm meant to be lonely
Guess I'm meant to be lonely
[Chorus: Powfu]
It's your fault that this turned out bad (This turned out bad)
It's your fault that you thought we had something (You thought we had something)
It's your fault that you hate me now (You hate me now)
I told you that I'm good for nothing (I'm good for nothing)
It's your fault that this turned out bad (This turned out bad)
It's your fault that you thought we had something (You thought we had something)
It's your fault that you hate me now (You hate me now)
I told you that I'm good for nothing (I'm good for nothing)
It's your fault that this turned out bad
It's your fault that you thought we had something
It's your fault that this turned out bad
I told you that I'm good for nothing

[Verse 2: guardin]
It's your fault that this turned out bad
It's my fault that you turned out sad
Lost a fight get close to loving
Iâ€™m a joke I hope you know that
And she comes to my mind
When I look at my
Phone screen in the night
Start to down another bottle
And she underestimates the power of the pesticide (Power of the pesticide)
Fix the homicide of all the flies and moths and things alive
Fuck the evidence it's evident that everything collides
I have more to say but I can never find the fucking time
You might also like[Bridge: Powfu]
Time feels frozen
High emotions
Lying here with you

[Chorus: Powfu]
It's your fault that this turned out bad (This turned out bad)
It's your fault that you thought we had something (You thought we had something)
It's your fault that you hate me now (You hate me now)
I told you that I'm good for nothing (I'm good for nothing)
It's your fault that this turned out bad (This turned out bad)
It's your fault that you thought we had something (You thought we had something)
It's your fault that you hate me now (You hate me now)
I told you that I'm good for nothing (I'm good for nothing)
It's your fault that this turned out bad
It's your fault that you thought we had something
It's your fault that this turned out bad
I told you that I'm good for nothing1Embed
