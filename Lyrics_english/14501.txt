BUTAKERA LYRICS ["Butakera" letter "]

[Enter: the Joaqui]
You say "butaquera"
I get on your ship, I rolo you, I put the theme 'I vo' more want '
The truly
Hide

[Verse 1: the Joaqui]
I enter a very fine chanteo, well guacha
Good turra, well facing, I like your ax
With 'Los Vago' in the very wide flat
I get ankle boots if they get the court
It is not the ship, it is the pilot
You say "Butaquera", in your tutu I put my toto
Saquemo 'A pair of photo' while you hang your motorcycle
With this Copilot Barbie
If your boyfriend does not hang it, queen, for my you are single
I am high second, it sucks it being first
If your boyfriend does not accelerate, queen, for my you are single
I'm taking the scene
[Bridge: the Joaqui]
BRR, your CR ronronea as a kitten
BRR, your CR ronronea as a kitten
BRR, your CR ronronea as a kitten
Brr, your cr ronronea as a kitten, you go '

[Chorus: The Noba]
Butaquera
Put the 'Bucanera'
Picive me what I have in the wallet
To that bud cut it with scissors'

[Verse 2: The Noba]
E-e-e-she is my gauchita, he likes pilot '
I like when dances, when the toto moves me
He likes Turrito 'with gold chain
I don't buy with the Cheto ', I don't buy with the parrots'
And I walk from Lacoste
I love when dessert is
I like to see you naked
What a chirlo in La Colita
I like it to be daring
That goes in front if they stir it
Move, talk
When they see her from afar, they know that
