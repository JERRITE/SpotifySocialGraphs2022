[Pitbull]
The Bigger they are, The Harder They Fall
The older ones are there, the hardest ones fall in love
These Big-Iddy Boys are Dig-Gidy Dogs
THESE GREAT ARE APPROVED ARE FILLING EYE
I have 'em like miley cyrus, clothes off
I have them like Miley Cyrus without clothes
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timbеr
They were stinging on the bra and they have straps, a strong target
Face down, booty up, timber
THE PERSON IS BELOW IS TRUE IS A TURN
That's the way wgo like to -what? –Timber
So do I like to be - what? - Powerful target
I'm slicker than an oil spill
I'm a malagan in the fool
She Say She Won's, But I Bet She Will, Timber
He said he doesn't want but I bet he wants, strong target

Swing your partner Round and Round
Dance your partner around
End of the Night, It's Going Down
By the time this night is over, he continues to dance to go down below
One more Shot, Another Round
Another hit, go to the other side
End of the Night, It's Going Down
Until this night is over, he keeps dancing down below
Swing your partner Round and Round
Dance your partner around
End of the Night, It's Going Down
Until this night is over, he dances to go down below
One more Shot, Another Round
Another hit of her, she changes going to the other side
End of the Night, It's Going Down
Until this night is over, he keeps dancing down below

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Look up in the sky is a bird is an airplane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn who changed
Yes, I am, I did not do much harm things changed
Live in Hotels, Swing on Planes
LIVES IN HOTELS DRY AIRS
Blessed to say, Money Ain't A Thing
IT'S BELIEVE I CAN SAVE, MONEY DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC
Club Jumping Like Lebron Now, Volí
The Club made it like LeBron NOW MAKES THIS FLOWER
Order Me Another Round, Homie
Go me to the other side, in the house
We about clown. Why? 'Cause It's About To Go Down
WE ARE MAKING WHAT? Because they were progressing down below
