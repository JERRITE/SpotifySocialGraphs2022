Lyricsi guard goes down it is necessary that it was not my intention
I would do nothing to hurt you
I'm learning to love you step by step
I'm wrong because sometimes jump
I tell you: "It wasn't my intention."
I don't know how many times you can repair the illusion
I know you're feeling very injured
I have never known how to do things
I collect loves and defeats
And today I name your pain
Low your guard, you bring ice in your eyes
I know it was I who stumbled
Everything I am, everything I have lived
It has been the way to be with you
And if for this error you leave my life
Signatures the ruling of a lost soul
Forgive heart, don't throw me to my luck
To cry that I am not so strong
Regrés me the light with which you looked at me
Tell me that you forgive me
If necessary I remind you that it was not my intention
I was imprisoned for my insecurities
It is my dagger that sinks into your flesh
My consciousness shipwrecked in your blood
I tell you: "It wasn't my intention."
Low your guard, you bring ice in your eyes
I know it was I who stumbled
Everything I am, everything I have lived
It has been the way to be with you
And if for this error you leave my life
Signatures the ruling of a lost soul
Forgive heart, don't throw me to my luck
To cry that I am not so strong
Regrés me the light with which you looked at me
Tell me that you forgive me
Everything I am, everything I have lived
It has been the way to be with you
And if for this error you leave my life
Signatures the ruling of a lost soul
Forgive heart, don't throw me to my luck
To cry that I am not so strong
Regrés me the light with which you looked at me
Tell me that forgave meu might also likembed
