TranslationsEspañol​oh my love Lyrics[Intro: Suzannah Pettigrew]
I went out with this boy once, yeah
And I met all his family
Went to some, like, family barbecue
And in the end: "Oh no, you're not my girl
You know, we're just, we're just like
Hanging out, aren't we?"

[Pre-Chorus: FKA Twigs]
Oh, my love
It's been a long, long road to get here
But you never said what you wanna do (No)
Oh, my love
It's been a long road
But you never, never said if you're letting me go for sure
If you won't let me go, then you gotta try and hold me close
[Chorus: FKA Twigs]
I could be with anyone
I'm fussy like a pussycat
You'rе the only one I want
Give lovе and then you take it back
All the kisses, all be fun
I hate it when you give me half
Never give me half
I, I, I, I

[Post-Chorus: FKA Twigs]
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Want your love, want your—

[Verse: FKA Twigs]
You wanna waste the day, I wanna spend the night
When our rhythm be runaway, I wanna make it right
You're just pushing me, pushing me
Pulling me, pulling me
Killing me, killing me
Softly, softly
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: FKA Twigs]
Oh, my love
It's been a long, long road to get here
But you never said if you're letting me go for sure
What you wanna do?

[Chorus: FKA Twigs]
I could be with anyone
I'm fussy like a pussycat
You're the only one I want
Give love and then you take it back
All the kisses, all be fun
I hate it when you give me half
Never give me half
I, I, I, I

[Bridge: FKA Twigs]
When the sun sets
Are you in with no doubt?
When the sun sets
I need to what you think about
Let me know, let me out
Tell me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Want your love, want your—
[Outro: Abigail Sakari]
Nah, but seriously, on a level, you're beautiful
We've not got a long time here, so
Love yourself, know your worth, and
Fuck crying over these stupid boys that don't even recognise the worth in themselves
Just tryna steal your youth
Bye, bye
But I love you and, um, I wish you could see in you what I see in you, what everyone sees in you, because
That's the golden stuff right there and these are your golden years, so have fun7Embed
