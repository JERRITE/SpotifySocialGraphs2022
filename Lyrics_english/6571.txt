The One to Survive LyricsI'm a winner
I'm a fighter
Here to stay
And you're gonna remember my name
No nothing can stand in my way
This what I live for
This is my game

Even if the sky is falling
Even if the waters rise
Even if the world is ending
I will make it out alive
I will be the one to survive
I'm a legend
I'm a lethal overdose
I'm a subject of your nightmare
I'm a ghost
There's only one spot on this throne
But I'll find my way up
Cause it's all I know

Even if the sky is falling
Even if the waters rise
Even if the world is ending
I will make it out alive
I will be the one to survive

I will be the one to survive

Even if the sky is falling
Even if the waters rise
Even if the world is ending
I will be the one to survive

I will be the one to surviveYou might also likeEmbed
