DYING 4 YOUR LOVE Lyrics[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Ooh-ooh, ah
Oh woah
Hm-mm

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Tell me, how
Are we supposed to still be talkin' every day
When everything between us just completely changed?
Oh, why?
Tell me, how
Am I supposed to go ahead and just erase
Every feeling, every memory we share?
Oh, why?
[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra & Ari PenSmith & P2J]
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
So tell me, how
How could you tell me that you love me by mistake?
Intoxicated, via texts, ain't you ashamed?
That's so wild
So how can I
Believe or trust in anything that you say
When you so easily regret it next day?
See, that ain't right

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra & Ari PenSmith & P2J]
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Ari Pensmith]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woah

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
I know nobody's perfect
And we are the way we are
But you know I don't deserve this
And I've waited way too long
'Cause I've been dying for this love, this love
Yeah, I've been dying for your love, your love5Embed
