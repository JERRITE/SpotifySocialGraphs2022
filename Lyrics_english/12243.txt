A Storm Is Coming Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somethin' waits within the shadows
Like an army in the night
Lock the doors and board the windows
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
A storm is comin' that you can't escape
Tears are fallin' like blood and rain
Thunder's shakin' and it's gonna break
A storm is comin' that you can't escape
[Verse 2]
Tears are fallin' from the darkness
Feel them crash upon your skin
Look for shelter, you won't find it
No-oh, no-oh

[Chorus]
A storm is comin' that you can't escape
Tears are fallin' like blood and rain
Thunder's shakin' and it's gonna break
A storm is comin' that you can't escape, no

[Outro]
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'
Oh, a storm is comin'You might also likeEmbed
