DiscoTheque Lyrics (CHU-LU CHU-LU CHU-LU PA-YA-PA)
(Disco Lady Disco Lady, Deep Emotion Deep Emotion)

Sweetie Darlin 'Let's dance Beauty Lady
I want to be reborn and sweet dream

Glamorous pink glossy nail
A real face surreal that reflects on the other side of the glass
I want to show so to you only in your heart
I want you to be near AH. Mirror Ball of the moon is illuminated
My Darlin 'Hey Vivid Love Sexy Beauty
The world that is reborn and sweet dreams will change the world
(CHU-LU CHU-LU CHU-LU PA-YA-PA)
(Sexy Feeling, Chu Chu ... Chu Chu ...)

I want to keep watching the dramatic deseration that does not fade
Colorful Sweety Story Engraved deeply
Even if a small darkness comes, if you cast a spell of love
Yeah, the endless empty stardust SHOWER is pouring down

So, aiming for Happy Station 50/50 together
I think it's here without 100%more than 100%
(CHU-LU CHU-LU CHU-LU PA-YA-PA)

Progressive and conservative self
I want you to like it as it is ...
The wish is (Disco Lady Disco Lady)
Deep Emotion True Emotion

My Darlin 'Let's dance more together Secret Night wonderful
Match with AH play with the heart of two love song decorations

My Darlin 'Hey Vivid Love Sexy Beauty
The world that is reborn and sweet dreams will change the world
