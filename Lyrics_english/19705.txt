Come and Go Lyrics[Hook - ROME]
Who’s gonna save my life
When everybody seems to come and go
Days and years go by, since you told us last that you’d be home (last time)
Try so hard to hide it, but it hurts more than you know
Who’s gonna save my life, when everybody seems to come and go

[Verse 1 – Jez Dior]
Oh my god not this again
How you gonna leave us in this mess
Me and you were supposed to be best friends
Now I’m lookin’ at you like the lesser man
All I got are these photographs
You crack jokes on the phone and I’m supposed to laugh?
I was brought up to be emotionless
And life come in waves like the ocean is
I’m so, sick and tired of being a hopeless kid
Walkin on home with a grocery bag
With barely enough just to feed us three
Mom barely paid the rent gotta make ends meet
How you gonna tell me that you love me when you not around
Telling me you coming home and giving me the run around
I’m running round the town just tryna give a fuck about
Any love that come my way, yeah I’m running out
[Chorus - ROME]
Who’s gonna save my life
When everybody seems to come and go
Days and years go by, since you told us last that you’d be home (last time)
Try so hard to hide it, but it hurts more than you know
Who’s gonna save my life, when everybody seems to come and go

[Verse 2 – Jez Dior]
I fuckin’ love you but I’m mad at you
But I understand what these bags can do
They’ll take ahold of your soul like that
Take your heart and rip a hole like that
It’s like I been through this shit so I know were the same
I’m so proud of you pops how far you have came
But this lil piece of me don’t see the score equally
You don’t understand what this whole thing mean to me
Everything that I grew up on
Every reason I’m a screw up for
Was all for you
And every verse that I blew up on
Every lyric that was in that song
Was all for you
I guess its time that I let this unfold
I cried every night till my heart turned cold
Yeah I gotta lot shit that you dont know
And I’m about to take it home
You might also like[Chorus - ROME]
Who’s gonna save my life
When everybody seems to come and go
Days and years go by, since you told us last that you’d be home (last time)
Try so hard to hide it, but it hurts more than you know
Who’s gonna save my life, when everybody seems to come and go

[Hook – Jez Dior/ROME]
Hole in my head, hole in my heart now
Where do you go and where do you run?
Hole in my life, filling the void now
Where do you run? Tell me now

[Chorus - ROME]
Who’s gonna save my life
When everybody seems to come and go
Days and years go by, since you told us last that you’d be home (last time)
Try so hard to hide it, but it hurts more than you know
Who’s gonna save my life, when everybody seems to come and goEmbed
