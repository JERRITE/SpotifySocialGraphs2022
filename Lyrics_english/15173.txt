Gardenia Lyrics[Verse 1]
One blow till I'll take ya down, I'll take ya down
One smoke and your head spins around and around
Chrome mags, a million drags, it never lags
An old transport queen mama, you never seen

[Chorus]
Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love unto you
[Verse 2]
Power booster, I'm talkin' to God and more
Crank it up and above my head
Smell my shit eating grin on the skin of my world
Six hundred sixty six miles per hour

[Chorus]
Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a burnin' fuel, oh they were burnin'
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love unto you
Makin' love unto you, making

[Outro]
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'
