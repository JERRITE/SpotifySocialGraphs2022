The Least That I Could Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
For you
I did a lot I shouldn't have done
But every time you touch me, I'm numb
And you can take the pain away
For you
I'd go out to ride with a gun
If you give me a shot, I won't run
I gotta go whatever it takes

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and maybe you might call me crazy
Loving you until it breaks me
You're worth more than everything I've got
[Chorus]
I'm falling apart to keep it together next to you
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
I'm risking it all for the one that I never wanna lose
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
For you
There ain't a problem I wouldn't fix
I'd even stop the Apocalypse
If we could stay for one more day

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and maybe you might call me crazy
Loving you until it breaks me
You're worth more than everything I've got

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart to keep it together next to you
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
I'm risking it all for the one that I never wanna lose
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm falling apart to keep it together next to you
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
I'm risking it all for the one that I never wanna lose
I swear that I'd die just to keep you alive
'Cause darling, that's the least that I could do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
