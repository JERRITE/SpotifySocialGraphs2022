Goodnight Girl LyricsYou hear me so clearly
And see how I try
You feel me, so heal me
And tear me apart

And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And do they have to know (do they have to know)
About my goodnight girl

Caught up in your wishin' well
You hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)
You keep me so near you
And see me so far
And hold me and send me
And deep in your heart

And I won't tell a soul (I won't tell a soul)
I won't tell at all (I won't tell at all)
And I won't let them know (I won't let them know)
About my goodnight girl

Caught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)

Caught up in your wishin' well
You hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)

It doesn't matter how sad
I made you
Doesn't matter how hard
I try

Just remember the same
Old reason
Reflected in your eyes
You said you wanted me
You might also likeCaught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)

Caught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)
