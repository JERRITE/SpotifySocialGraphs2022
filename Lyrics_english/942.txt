Desire there are plenty of lyrics [letter from "desire left over" ft. Justin Quiles]

[Pre-car: Bryant Myers]
Yesterday I talked to your best friend
I asked him how I was going
He told me that you still seek me (ah-ah)
That you have a boyfriend, but you are pretending
That you have not forgotten everything we were
In bed how we ate
But if there is a desire to repeat it
You just call me, because—
[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Justin Quiles]
When you want to turn, I'm going to be here
Desire there are more ’, you have to kill her '
He is not going to find out that he will devour you
And when he doesn't have you in my bed
When you want to turn pa 'you I'm going to be (oah, oah)
Desire there are more ', you have to kill her'
He is not going to find out that you will devour you (Oah, Oah)
And that when he is not I have you in my bed

[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
You made me a spell, for me that you ere 'witch
I crossed the skin with a needle
In bed he does not mistreat you or squeeze you
With him you 'pretending, you live inside ’e a bubble
What he does ’is wrong, but desire unites us
When you start getting sick, you call me to empty you
From Mars ’a lne ', I'm pa' ti at the time
Baby, my body always wishes you
A forbidden love, two crazy people united by a little while
He has never known what the tricks are ', to go crazy

[Choir: Bryant Myers, Justin Quiles & Miky Woodz]
When you want to turn, I'm going to be here
Desire there are more ’, you have to kill her '
He is not going to find out that he will devour you
And that when he does not have you in my bed
When you want to turn pa 'you I'm going to be (oah, oah)
I want to miss more ', you have to kill her' (hahahahaha)
He is not going to find out that you will devour you (Oah, Oah)
And that when he is not I have you in my bed
(Baby, let yourself go for the OG, Miky Woodz)

Don't deny me (no)
I know you think about me when you drink (yep)
But you don't appear for the Rede '(Never)
Vo'a Look for you, Scap yourself, don't stay '(Yeah)
I'm already trying and I know you're going to want to turn to me when you try me (I know it)
And you see, your lies or yourself believe them (na ')
What are you happy? (Nope)
Do not come to put feca again (no, no)
Girl, I don't want an excuse ', leave her Pa'horita (Yes, Sir)
I want to eat you in a penthouse around Bocachica
With a sea view, I know you will impress you (wuh)
You on your back, looking at the sky and with the tits stuck 'in the glass (Hol' Up)
I later 'from that I went down' pa 'the capital (ey)
Bellaqueando non -stop
What are you happy with him? (HUH)
Get to deceive (UH)

[Verse 3: Justin Quiles]
When you want to turn, you know that you will give you
An unforgettable night I want to give you
When you want to turn, you know that I will eat you (oah, oah)
To 'that' places that you don't give him
I know you like with Cojone '
Because I put it as he doesn't put it on you (Yah, Yah)
With me you feel excitement '
And with him he does not feel 'none' and you are feeling '(Yah, Yah)
I know that you ere 'mine, you don't have to tell me na'
You show you in the face when with me it is'
I know they are not felice ', you' go there for being
You can't deny me, baby
I know that you ere 'mine, you don't have to tell me na'
You show you in the face when with me it is'
I know they are not felice ', you' go there for being
You can't deny me, baby
[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Justin Quiles]
When you want to turn, I'm going to be here
Desire there are more ', you have to kill her'
He is not going to find out that he will devour you
And that when he does not have you in my bed
When you want to turn pa 'ti I vo' to be (oah, oah)
Desire there are more ', you have to kill her'
He is not going to find out that you will devour you (Oah, Oah)
And that when he is not I have you in my bed
