PPP Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, "Are you ready
Ready for this life?"

[Verse 2]
Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass
[Chorus]
Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

[Verse 3]
Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

[Verse 4]
It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well

[Verse 5]
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

[Chorus]
Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistakeYou might also like19Embed
