LONELY HIGHWAY Lyrics[Intro: johan lenox]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Eli Sostre]
I'm off the leash
I'm high, I'm shaded up with keys, I feel like Stevie
I seen some shit if I would say, you won't believe me
She wanna a three, that bitch a freak, don't ever leave me
I'm off that high grade

[Chorus: Eli Sostre]
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Ridin' on this lonely highway
[Verse 1: Eli Sostre]
New York City, plates on foreigns, uh
When it's rainin', it be pourin'
Call me back up in the mornin'
She said, "I thought I told you not to call me"
I pull up then you wanna put it on me
You go right back to him like you ain't saw me
But you let me know that's all me, ha
You let me know I'm exactly what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Eli Sostre]
I'm off the leash
I'm high, I'm shaded up with keys, I feel like Stevie
I seen some shit if I would say, you won't believe me
She wanna do me, that bitch a freak, don't ever leave me
I'm off that high grade

[Chorus: Eli Sostre]
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Sometimes I just wanna fly away (Fly away)
Ridin' on this lonely highway

[Verse 2: Eli Sostre]
Yeah
And I had to do it my way
And she's tryna swing it my way
Why the fuck they lookin' at me sideways?
Doin' about a hundred on the highway

[Outro: johan lenox]
Everything is hard and everything's a sham
I could be a lot but I'm stuck with who I am
So I put it out my mind, nothin' I could try
Wouldn't wanna miss havin' everything I wish with you
We only get a minute here until the world burns
Tried to run away and tried to take what I deserve
Tell me that you love me and I'll turn to dust
You (You, you)Embed
