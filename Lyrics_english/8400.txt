E 'A murderer, she leads to medicine
Deceiving that wraps you and dominates you
An abuser; She as she knows, devours you
And if you don't have 'experience, you fall in love
A specialist will make her in sight
He goes to a nice and will be 'one more' on his list
What if 'malicious? I, who treated her as a goddess
He cheated on me and now calls me like crazy, Aha
