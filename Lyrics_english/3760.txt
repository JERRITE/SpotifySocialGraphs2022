[Intro]
MMM, please stay alive, yeah

[Verse 1]
Where is it wrong?
I don't remember at all
While hiding my body in a small room
It's a whisper
My friend is the only darkness (my friend)
My hand to salvation
Am I weird
Bloody room
Anyone can save me
[Pre-Chorus]
Hide in the moonlight
Yes, there is no miracle
My winds are just
Hide in the moonlight
It's not that big at all
That's difficult
At the end of the dawn when you can't sleep
It looks like a nightmare with my eyes open
I said there was no miracle
A word that came like a miracle

[Chorus]
Your destiny
I can't explain in this word
Salvation who saved me tired
Is this easy to explain
That word that saved me
Even after many nights
I'll be by your side
OOH, yeah (one word)
Even if I blood on my feet
Because you are by your side

[Post-Chorus]
Please, you stay alive
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
Please, you stay alive
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
Please, you stay alive

The picture is growing
It's okay, thanks to the big light
The profits of my life are you all
You just smile like that at any time
You are so similar to me
I look so similar to you
Sometimes it's scary for no reason
What is this feeling
It may be over, but

[Pre-Chorus]
At the end of this nightmare that is not over
I raised the day you said, every day
It resembles a miracle that came like a miracle
A miracle like a miracle

[Chorus]
Your destiny
I can't explain in this word
Salvation who saved me tired
Is this easy to explain (OOH)
That word that saved me
Even after many nights
I'll be by your side
OOH, yeah (one word)
Even if I blood on my feet
Because you are by your side
Please, you stay alive
[OUTRO]
You are my salvation
I can't explain in this word
Please, you stay alive
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
Please, you stay alive13embed
