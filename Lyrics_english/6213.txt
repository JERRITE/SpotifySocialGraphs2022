Beach Bummer Lyrics[Verse 1: Sabrina Mai & Basil Saleh]
I could cry for days
When I hear your name
Things don't feel the same
I'm the only one inside today

[Chorus: Sabrina Mai & Basil Saleh]
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it is a mystery to me
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it's ancient history to me
[Verse 2: Sabrina Mai & Basil Saleh]
Just slap me in the face
Been worn out as of late
My friends go to the beach
I'm too tired to sleep

[Chorus: Sabrina Mai & Basil Saleh]
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it is a mystery to me
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it's ancient history to me

[Outro: Basil Saleh]
Now it's ancient history to me
Now it's ancient history to meYou might also like8Embed
