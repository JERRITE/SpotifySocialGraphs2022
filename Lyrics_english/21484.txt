Kill My Boyfriend Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
'Cause he's only nice when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

[Verse 1]
It's been a minute, love
Wish we never broke it off
I hated that we separated
Can't forget you, no
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now I got an another
Got a ring, I got a lover
I'm about to have a mother-in-law
And things are kinda perfect, but I know you're fucking worth it
There's only one thing I can do to break it off, come on

[Chorus]
I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
'Cause he's only nice when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

[Post-Chorus]
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, kill, kill, kill
So we can run away just like we said
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, kill, kill, kill
So we can be together like we planned

[Verse 2]
You're the one I want
Everything I'm dreaming of
Don't make me break his heart
In a million pieces, no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But every time I'm with him, I imagine that we're kissing
And I'm wishing he was you all along
And boy I'm so committed
I'm so deep, there's no more digging
There's only one thing I can do to solve this mess, come on
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
'Cause he's only nice when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

[Post-Chorus]
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, kill, kill, kill
So we can run away just like we said
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, kill, kill, kill
So we can be together like we planned

[Interlude]
Oh oh, yeah, eh

[Bridge]
And I'll do the time, you're my sweetest crime
You know that I'll wait for you, baby
And we'll be apart, but you'll have my heart
I'm saving it all for you, baby
And I'll do the time, you're my sweetest crime
You know that I'll wait for you, baby
And we'll be apart, but you'll have my heart
I'm saving it all for you, baby
[Post-Chorus]
