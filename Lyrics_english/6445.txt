Van Horn Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thug life, baby
It chose me, I didn't choose this city
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Walk right over
You're a 10, I'm a four-leaf clover

[Chorus]
Well, tell me do you hate me
Or do you wanna date me?
It's kinda hard to tell
'Cause your eyes are looking crazy
Oh, why you coming over
Anything but sober?
Looking like it's time tonight
For fight or flight in Van Horn
[Verse 2]
Hold it steady
Drill it in like you're J. Paul Getty
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Smith and Wesson
Taking shots that'll keep you guessing

[Chorus]
Well, tell me do you hate me
Or do you wanna date me?
It's kinda hard to tell
'Cause your eyes are looking crazy
So why you coming over
Anything but sober?
Looking like it's time tonight
For fight or flight in Van Horn

[Bridge]
Ooh, what you gonna do?
Van Horn
What you gonna do?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, tell me do you hate me
Or do you wanna date me?
It's kinda hard to tell
'Cause your eyes are looking crazy
So why you coming over
Anything but sober?
Looking like it's time tonight
For fight or flight in Van Horn
You might also like[Outro]
Ooh, what you gonna do?
Van Horn
What you gonna do?5Embed
