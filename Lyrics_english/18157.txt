Roommates Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I've got plenty of roommates, even when I'm alone
I've never known any silence, they turn my head into home
And they keep me awake with a vacancy sign
Yeah, I got plenty of roommates
And they're all in my mind
[Verse 1]
I try to be patient, take medication
So I can feel alright
But that voice in my head, seems like it's obsessed
With keepin' me up all night
Yeah, it knows every part of me
It causes all my anxiety
It just ain't fair
It shouldn't be there

[Refrain]
Maybе I'm overthinking lately
Maybe thе pressure's gonna break me
Feeling like everything's changing
And I can't control the situation

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got plenty of roommates, even when I'm alone
I've never known any silence, they turn my head into home
And they keep me awake with a vacancy sign
Yeah, I got plenty of roommates
And they're all in my mind

[Verse 2]
They say that I'm shy, 'cause most days I try
To hide away and stay inside
Drown out the noise by pickin' a poison
That makes me lose my mind
Start to think walls are cavin' in
I feel weaker than I've ever been
It just ain't fair
I shouldn't be scared

Maybe I'm overthinking lately
Maybe the pressure's gonna break me
Feeling like everything's changing
And I can't control the situation

[Bridge]
No, I tried to kick 'em out
Tried to turn 'em down
But they're getting real loud and
I, I'm scared, I know that they’re
Not goin' anywhere
But I'm not movin' out
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates (Roommates)
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates
Yeah, yeah
No, I tried to kick 'em out
Tried to turn 'em down
But they're getting real loud and
I, I'm scared, I know that they’re
Not goin' anywhere
But I'm not movin' out
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates (Roommates)
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates (Roommates)
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates (Roommates)
I guess that I've got to live with all these roommates (Roommates)
[Chorus]
I've got plenty of roommates (Oh-oh), even when I'm alone (Oh-oh)
I've never known any silence (Oh-oh), they turn my head into home (Oh-oh)
And they keep me awake (Oh-oh), with a vacancy sign (Oh-oh)
Yeah, I got plenty of roommates (Oh-oh), and they're all in my mind13Embed
