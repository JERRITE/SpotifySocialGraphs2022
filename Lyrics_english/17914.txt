Prohibited (remix) Lyrics [letter of "prohibited (remix)" ft. Lali & Ana Mena]

[Intro]
I-I-ICON

[Verse 1: Bryan]
I'm tired to tell your friends
That nothing has happened, how strange
Yes at dawn when you call
You tell me that we see you at home
Only at home
[Pre-car: Alonso]
Then you go and say that the thing is not like that
I don't understand why you have to lie

[Chorus: Alonso, Jos]
Tell me why you say we are friends
If what we feel is not normal
Do not confuse what you have with me
If friends do not play below clothes
Tell me why you say we are friends
If what we feel is not normal
Do not confuse what you have with me
If when a friend touches you, he can't go crazy
As I do

[Verse 2: Freddy, Ana Mena]
A friend does not take flowers to the house
It doesn't even give your heart, Mommy tell me what's up
Much less dedicate your songs
That's why I come and ask you for explanations (okay)

[Verse 3: Ana Mena]
You, it is already given how
That we are more than panas and you want more than me
I do not deny that I love a little love (you know)
But they don't call me the commitments
And now you come by reproaching that this does not fit you
But daddy, it is to know that I send in my bed
You already know what my position will be
I'm not that girl looking for a relationship
You Might Also Like [verse 4: Lali]
I am your friend and although something else happens
I don't want to shout at others
This is right, that this is here

[Saying: lali]
What happens is that I have more friends like you
And everyone brings me flowers
And I'm testing different flavors
I have more friends like you
And everyone brings me flowers
And I'm testing different flavors

[Chorus: Alonso + Lali + Ana, Jos + Lali, Lali]
Tell me why you say we are friends
If what we feel is not normal
Do not confuse what you have with me
If friends do not play below clothes (mmh-ahh)
Tell me why you say we are friends (uoh)
If what we feel is not normal
Do not confuse what you have with me
If when a friend touches you, he can't go crazy
As I do

[Bridge: Alan, + Ana Mena]
I would like to know if it is something personal
Which did not allow you to talk about me
When I pass? Or, did you bothered you?
Let's clarify this at once, here
[Saying: lali]
What happens is that I have more friends like you
And everyone brings me flowers
And I'm testing different flavors
I have more friends like you
And everyone brings me flowers
And I'm testing different flavors

[Outro: CD9, Lali, Ana Mena]
Tell me why you say we are friends (uohh)
CD9 (Yeah, Yeah)
I-I-Icon (Lali)
If what we feel is not normal
Ana Mena (Yeah, EH)
If friends don't touch
