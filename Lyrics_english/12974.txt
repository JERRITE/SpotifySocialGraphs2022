Mean Streets Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer up in the Catskills, baby
Singing just for the thrill
Everyone knows all about you, don't they?
You're doing it for the thrill

[Chorus]
Whatever's left, you'll find
You got to give it what you got now
You got to give it what you got
Baby, it's true, we leave nothing for you
You got to give it what you got now
You got to give it what you got
[Post-Chorus]
Laura, there's nothing wrong with fame
Laura, you'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Didn't you know they would love you, baby
Even more, now that you're gone
Leaving them surreptitiously
Could make a hit out of any song

[Chorus - variation]
Whatever's left, you'll find
You got to give it what you got now
You got to give it what you got
Stay, on your own, or leave it alone
You got to give it what you got now
You got to give it what you got

[Post-Chorus]
Laura, there's nothing wrong with fame
Laura, you'll never be the same

[Outro]
Born and raised on the mean streets
That's where she learned how to keep the beat
Some say that girl's got something
I heard her name half a million times
Hustlin' in the mean streets (Laura)
That's where she learned how to keep the beat (Laura)
Some say that girl's got something (Laura)
I heard her name half a million times (Laura)You might also like3Embed
