360 Boy Lyrics[Intro]
Taurus

[Chorus]
360 boy I hop out FN-n-n
360 boy hit Mansfield then I'm spinnin'
5.56 in the clip it hurt ya shin-n
I ain't hurtin, bitch I'm splurgin', countin' these Benjins
No Ls in the foreign, license suspended
10 Ps, I been dressin' in evintage
These niggas say they killers but who really?
All I see is red on the stick, rockin' Rick
[Verse 1]
Yeah don't start that trippin', you get whipped up with this switch
Niggas need this tampon cause they actin' like a bitch
Drive SRT on bullshit, drive the Benz went on Swift
911 coupe, it burn tires when it drift (Yessirski)
Be careful with no iron, quick to come up off the hip
Pushin' P and pressurе, yeah that money gon' get you dippеd (Nigga)
I went right, I seen [?], but my partner screamin' crip
This shit for Pope, brother just get your rest, don't trip
I was just fuckin' on her and her friend
Mines in the grave, so don't call me twin
My hoe rich, she whippin' a Benz
She whippin' Bentayga, whenever she sin
Ain't bout' no paper, we can't talk biz
And I know that you tellin' to crackers like skins
Kill at the rats, let the real out the pen, yeah (Top shelf)

[Chorus]
360 boy I hop out FN-n-n
360 boy hit Mansfield then I'm spinnin'
5.56 in the clip it hurt ya shin-n
I ain't hurtin, bitch I'm splurgin', countin' these Benjins
No Ls in the foreign, license suspended
10 Ps, I been dressin' in evintage
These niggas say they killers but who really?
All I see is red on the stick, rockin' Rick
You might also like[Verse 2]
Catch him at the red light
Know that's a dead light
Put his ass to bed like (Uh)
Livin' that fast life
Rammin' her taillight
See what that head like
Long live Mac, Big, and Keed, they kickin' in paradise (Keed talk to em)
Now I'm thinkin' this real life
Got me poppin these pills like, (Ah-huh)
Yeah know it's Keed talk to em forever
Margiela jacket with a red umbrella
Goin' number 1, Imma wear my medal
Let J-money r-r-r-r on you and yo fellas
We run up these racks while you wait on a settle
You could kept the bitch, her head ain't nothin'
Like 5 racks on a Dolce Gabbana
Bust in my safe, a whole lotta hunnas
[?] beat on that pussy and snatch out a [?]
Most of y'all lie to ya kids, get in the court tell the truth to the honor (Ya pussy)
100K on a light day
Everything goin' my way
If it don't, it's the highway
Cartier with the bright face

[Chorus]
360 boy I hop out FN-n-n (Top shelf, nigga)
360 boy hit Mansfield then I'm spinnin'
5.56 in the clip it hurt ya shin-n
I ain't hurtin, bitch I'm splurgin', countin' these Benjins
No Ls in the foreign, license suspended
10 Ps, I been dressin' in evintage
These niggas say they killers but who really?
All I see is red on the stick, rockin' RickEmbed
