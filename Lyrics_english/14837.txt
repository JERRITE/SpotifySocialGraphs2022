Pretty Noose Lyrics[Verse 1]
I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight
[Chorus]
Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

[Verse 2]
Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone
Out from and far away
The wooden stake
This thing has got me on

[Chorus]
Diamond rope, silver chain
Pretty noose is pretty pain
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need
I don't want anything
You might also likeAnd I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
