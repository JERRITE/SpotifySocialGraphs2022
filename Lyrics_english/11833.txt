Lyrics Blue Summer [Blue Summer Lyrics "]

[Intro]
Summer, summer is blue
No Matter Where You Are, in the Caribbean, in Europe
Because summer is blue
You know how it is David! Eat on!

[Pre-stribe]
She’s Movin ’Like A Rock Star, Movin’ Is A Porn Star
Give him, go, you don’t stop, don't stop, give him, mommy
Move, crazy, kiss me in my mouth, strong as a rock
Blue summer pa ’ti and pa’ me
[Chorus]
Dance my soca, the hand up, crazy, already take off your clothes
Let's drink from my cup, already move me the stern
I like you, perreating a little lu '
Skirt and truck, there is no taboo

[Bridge]
You know how it is David! Eat on!
(Hahaha) summer is blue

[Verse]
We dawned, it was summer, Latin American (so!, So!)
And the sun on my car, burning 'Las Hand' (So! SO!)
And the lip 'kisses'
Now I watched 'to Metel
I remember one night, in my car (Oh! How?!)
Oh what mess! You took my cold
For your curvitas I guide me (haha)
You say you are free, and I trust (se)
If I knew that a man was waiting for you (Yeah)
I wouldn't have what I was playing
Mine is hard and yours is soft
Sweet like mango
What are you talking about?
Yes it was your fault, do not get the noise
I did not know that you were yours
When the patrol arrived
"Lord agent, put me hot
I am not guilty, nor am I indecent
Ask people "
