Nervous Driver LyricsSorry if lately I don't want to fight
I keep waiting all night to go out of my mind
If you've got a reason, I'm sure that you're right
It's not bad to be right
But if you know I am wrong
Why don't you tell me why?

Sorry if lately I give up too quick
Go flying down highways and throwing my fists
And sink in the moments and spinning for it
It's not you that I miss
But if you know I am wrong
I wish you would tell me why
Or just hold me close before you go
At least hold me close before I go
Don't know you I need a goodbye?
Cause I'm too nervous to driveYou might also likeEmbed
