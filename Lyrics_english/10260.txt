Boys II (Boys 2) Lyrics [The lyrics "Boys II"]

[Chorus]
I smoke shit - this is juicy sativa
I take a micro rhyme for rhyme, let them know
And brothers with me, I am ready to tear for them
I could only dream of such friendship
Why all the money, if there is no one to spend?
I need advice, platinum will not be able to give it
The numbers will never be covered from behind
Why do you need a face? He will not let you take it
I smoke shit - this is juicy sativa
I take a micro rhyme for rhyme, let them know
And brothers with me, I am ready to tear for them
I could only dream of such friendship
Why all the money, if there is no one to spend?
I need advice, platinum will not be able to give it
The numbers will never be covered from behind
Why do you need a face? He will not let you take it
[Verse 1]
Whisper melts in my head
You are alone, I am alone, he is alone, and each alone
I will understand, I will become stronger
That I am lonely and one will lie in the ground
Shadows crawl along the wall to me (along the wall to me)
I drowned gradually, now at the bottom (now at the bottom)
I blink for centuries, I see no one (anyone)
I smoke nettles with bouquets
- Fludd, what are these methods?
- I don't know, I'm flying
For them I do not get
Smoke from cigarettes
Sweet fog, take pain
I blew up and I am not visible
I'm ready to be anywhere
Going beyond the limits of the lim

[Chorus]
I smoke shit - this is juicy sativa
I take a micro rhyme for rhyme, let them know
And brothers with me, I am ready to tear for them
I could only dream of such friendship
Why all the money, if there is no one to spend?
I need advice, platinum will not be able to give it
The numbers will never be covered from behind
Why do you need a face? He will not let you take it
I smoke shit - this is juicy sativa
I take a micro rhyme for rhyme, let them know
And brothers with me, I am ready to tear for them
I could only dream of such friendship
Why all the money, if there is no one to spend?
I need advice, platinum will not be able to give it
The numbers will never be covered from behind
Why do you need a face? He will not let you take it

And, probably, all this is a dream (sleep)
I wake up at night - fire in my head (fire)
Flute - spine, I will play solo (solo)
You put everything on the con or you go to food (food)
One of one hundred thousand of the same people (people)
Whose soul is dirtier than pigs (pigs)
Only snake languages ​​(snakes) caress the back of the head (snakes)
I will not give them a chance to make me weaker
To be on top, smoke dances on the water
We hang out all day
Doobie is smoking with friends
132, let them know why we are here
No longer holding offense
For those who have chosen another way
Each has its own battle
Time as Okkama razor (I)
While the glasses are full
There is not a drop of gloom in me
The boys know horses
The streets know their names
Packs below friendship, namely
Who lit the fire inside me?
When it was like a mummy
We grow up, like libido
For the team, wait - this is how it is customary
Glam to the coffin - La Familia

I could only dream of such friendship
Why all the money, if there is no one to spend?

The numbers will never be covered from behind
Why do you need a face? He will not let you take it108mbed
