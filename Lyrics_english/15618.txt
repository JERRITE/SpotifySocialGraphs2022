Consider with me Lyrics [lyrics by "Cybat with me" ft. Nicky Jam]

[Intro: Silvestre Dangond & Nicky Jam]
Love, love does not end
Love is transformed
And stays in the soul
For love, for love is forgiven
If it's for that person
There are no errors that are worth

[Pre-car: Silvestre Dangond & Nicky Jam]
With you I'm stronger
Because by your side
I learned to lift
You can see in my eyes
I'm never going to leave you
With the hand in the chest, my love
Today my heart wants to sing to you
With one thousand songs
I have something to ask you
[Choir: Silvestre Dangond & Nicky Jam]
Consider with me, get married to me
After so much time
If we are together is destiny
Consider with me, get married to me
If the sun and the storm
They will also be part of the way
I want to be with you
I ask you for God
Marry me
(Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam)

[Verso: Nicky Jam & Silvestre Dangond]
Marry me
I see my life with you
I will be your husband, lover and best friend
And that I put to God as a witness
You are always in my mind
First lady and I am the president
Get me, my heart does not lie to you
Tell me that with a very strong hug
Oh, you are always in my mind
First lady and I am the president
Get me, my heart does not lie to you
Tell me that with a very strong hug
(Tell me wild)

You are going to be the wedding godfather of this server
I'm going to marry the world's prettiest princess
Marry me
Oh, man

Because by your side I learned to lift
You can see in my eyes that I will never leave you
With the hand in the chest, my love
Today my heart wants to sing to you
With one and a thousand songs, I have something to ask you
[Chorus: Silvestre Dangond & Nicky Jam]
Consider with me (get on with me), get on to me (get on with me)
After so long, if we are together is the destination
Consider with me (get on with me), get on to me (get on with me)
If the sun and the storm will also be part of the road
I want to be with you
I ask you for God
