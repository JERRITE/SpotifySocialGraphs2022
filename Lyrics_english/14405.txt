The Fantasy Life Of Poetry & Crime Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bells, they chime
Bells, they chime in time
To a vicious low whine of a chainsaw's grind
In the summertime
There's a coppery taste
A gun in your face
High plains drift, sly shapes shift across the Maritime

[Verse 2]
In the estuary
There's a clue to find
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime
Haute-Normandy and Seine-Maritime
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime
[Chorus]
Je suis ici
Can you follow me?
All sorrow for me
Have I begun this too weirdly?

[Verse 3]
Sweet mystеry and a clue to find
In the fantasy life of poеtry and crime
Unknowingly
I'm lost in space and time
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime

[Chorus]
Je suis ici
Can you follow me?
Do you read me?
Have I begun this too weirdly?

[Verse 4]
In the estuary
There's a clue to find
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime
Haute Normandy and Seine-Maritime
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime

Bells they chime
Bells they chime in time
A vicious low whine of a chainsaw's grind in the summertime
Bells they chimeEmbed
