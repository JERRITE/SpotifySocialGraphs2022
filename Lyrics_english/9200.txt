Itâ€™s the Lyrics War [intro]
Yeah, 2019
Paname is war, yeah
Mayhem X

Yo, Kings machine clicks
Ayo

[Verse 1]
It's war, son of a whore, move your only ones, where I stop you
Or you will be like the millions of jerry when Tom plays the flute
If only we could solve this fucking old -fashioned problem
1-9-9-3, NTM, Wesh, the lease is cool like Shen
Sike, like X-Men, my vision is destructive, yeah, poto
For the moment, the next reconstruction will be decisive, yeah, poto
The sound? Hard-core, like a violent teacher
The world will die, I will arrive at my last time happy
These sons of Eup sniff, now they believe Blanka
But real guys like Oim will not remain docile, no, guy
I did not forget on November 13 and the hostage -taking
No, I'm not going to go and I'm targeting the storm
My name is not Thor, but I go to love at first sight
In the normal, do belek-eh, frertot, the guedro is pecho by buggers
War in blocks, non -stop, between us and the cops
Shuis not gangster, my brother, but you have to change the direction of the Glocks, it's war
[Verse 2]
I observe this fucking people every week and I become more like Frank Castle
If I turned the mirror and I feel hatred, it's not because of Vinz Cassel
The world must change, but everyone wants to biff
How are we going to do the diff, if most of us like, sniff
The c, the a, the m, the e, ah yeah, the j, the o, the i-n-t
Punker song-me, I am enchanting, but I will continue in indoor
Even my name has a mp, I don't want it, but I'm violent
I push the revolution in my zik, for my clique, for the world
