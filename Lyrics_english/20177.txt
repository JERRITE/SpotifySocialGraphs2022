Lite Brite Lyrics [Words of "Lite Brite"]

[Intro: Cory]
It’s been a secret for anyone
We like to lose the card
In all the roots of the city
Big up with Varte Light
Who plays a fort
Chu too drunk, I'm still saying
First -rate drunkard
My hose must be twisted
Tightness
Without a net I take the rope
I have to remove the cap
Yienk before I overflow
When there remains
I go back to our own
I can't get north for no reason
I need the plug
[Verse 1: cory]
It’s been a secret for anyone
We like to lose the card
In all the roots of the city
Big up with Varte Light
Who plays a fort
Chu too drunk, I'm still saying
First -rate drunkard
My hose must be twisted
Tightness
Without a net I take the rope
I have to remove the cap
Yienk before I overflow
When there remains
I go back to our own
I can't get north for no reason
I need the plug

[Verse 2: vice]
Do you go well not
How many beers I could drink
Through my setbacks
To have stories
Crazed, could know
Make you maybe, do not get the bicycle
At night we get our heads for real toxicolics
I want to be hard to recognize
I want to look like Toxic
Worse come back to storm
Naked feet, coat pu, pu of money
Molish my molars
Kordik jaw
A polar bear that is bored of the Nordic
You might also like [verse 3: Cory]
My language pollutes the air
When I take my experience
The middle finger in the air
Everyone wants me
Legendary white trash
Your mother eats my ass
You condom, calm your nerves
You have seen nothing
Ch’t’a a black taboo legionnaire
Trained
Let the missionary
It’s your buttocks that have been bandaged
For my birthday
Give me your cenne c’t’année
My intentions must be clear
To see your fork water flow

[Verse 4: vice]
Ha! As snow has snow
My head a warhead garden
The smoked partition
Worse there is the plaster that freezes
The blower is in rack
The problem must be fixed
The bag does not allow slack
It’s pale like Lent
Filled with good wills
But nothing works anymore
It gets along with a nose
Klaxon traffic
Must free the path
Take a machine
Wait until tomorrow
Would fold the spine
Let's clear our aisles
To your comrades
When it stays there
We will be frowning from other bags
[Outro: vice]
Not too hot to heat
But too drunk to breathe
Beautiful as a bruite lite
Once Ben lit

[Outro: Cory]
Not too hot to heat
But too drunk to breathe
Beautiful as a bruite lite
Once Ben lit
