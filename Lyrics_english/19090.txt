Dulce Habanera Lyrics [Lyrics for "Dulce Habanera"]

When they see you in the rumba
Habanera, they all say, how beautiful comes
With you they want to dance

To savor the Son that Cuba has
That scanned mulatto
Prefer the entire world, pure cinnamon
The rumba is going to sing
And come back to dance
Sweet Havana
To the rumba that Havanera arrived
That the pine
The Santiago arrived
To the rumba that Havanera arrived
That the camagueya, Villaclare√±a
And Havanera is me
It's me

To the rumba that Havanera arrived
Eh, the Panamanian and the Colombian
The Mexican arrived
To the rumba that Havanera arrived
They will ensure velezolana velen
And the Ecuadorian and the Haitians, by God
To the rumba that Havanera arrived

To the rumba that Havanera arrived
Huh, with Uruguaya and Argentina
With the Peruvian I am leaving
To the rumba that Havanera arrived
That the Costa Rican, Nicaraguan
And the Guatemalan called me, and I'm leaving
To the rumba that Havanera arrived
The Brazilian and the Bolivian
And the Cuban is me!
You might also like the rumba that Havanera arrived
That the Chilean, the Hondurans, Salvadoran
Oh, how they enjoy this direction
To the rumba that Havanera arrived

That the salsera arrived
That the salsera arrived
That the salsera arrived
That the salsera arrived

The Panamanian dances so borera
That the salsera arrived
Oh, the Puerto Rican is the most salsera
That the salsera arrived
And the Dominican, the merenguera
That the salsera arrived
Everyone tells me that I am Salasera
That the salsera arrived
What sauce with sauce knows more sauce
That the salsera arrived
Eh ahh ... embed
