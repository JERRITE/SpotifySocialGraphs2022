Gentle Groove LyricsLike my World I'm on Fire
I am full of Desire
No more preachin' on your part
No more love on my pillow yea...

Come play with me in my room
You can hold me hands yeah
I... I'm gonna be your boyfriend
And you can call me Names... ah, oh you!

And nothing's gonna change the way I feel for my Love
And nothing's gonna slow my GENTLE GROOVE
'Til Kingdom Come the work is done
On Earth as it is in Dallas...
Come dance with me in my room
You can hold me hands yea... I... I'm gonna be your boyfriend!
And you can call me Names... oh, oh yeah

And nothing's gonna take the Power away from my Love
And nothing's gonna change the way I feel... no way...
And one's gonna slow my GENTLE GROOVE
'Til Kingdom Come the work is done
On Earth as it is in Dallas come on do it!

Every time... only gonna run babe...You might also likeEmbed
