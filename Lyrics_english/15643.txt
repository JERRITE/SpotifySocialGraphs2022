It won't be the same (cover girl) Lyricshoy I knew that you already have someone else 
 I hope everything works badly 
 Don't talk to me, you already changed me 
 But I know 

 It will not be the same 
 You will not forget Me 
 You will remind me on your lips 
 And at night I know you're going to cry 
 It will not be the same 
 You're going to look for me 
 Contempt you will only find 
 And in your loneliness you will burn 
 Today I knew, yesterday your love betrayed you 
 How sad it soon returned 
 Don't talk to me, don't try 
 I already told you 

 It will not be the same 
 You will not forget Me 
 You will remind me on your lips 
 And at night I know you're going to cry 
 It will not be the same 
 You're going to look for me 
 Contempt you will only find 
 And in your loneliness you will burn 

 Don't talk to me, you already changed me 
 But I know well 
 Don't talk to me, don't try 
 I already told you 

 It will not be the same 
 You will not forget Me 
 You will remind me on your lips 
 And at night I know you're going to cry 
 It will not be the same 
 You're going to look for me 
 Contempt you will only find 
 And in your loneliness you're going to burn yourself Might Also Likeembed
