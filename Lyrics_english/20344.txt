Last One Standing (Ace Aura Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
When we keep waiting on the storm clouds
I'll come running if you call out
Last one standing when the sky falls down (Mmm)
Give me something to believe in
Dance like we don't even hear them
Last one standing when the sky falls down
The last one standing
