Next to You Lyrics[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day that you keep that smile
Yeah, you are my dream (You are my dream), there's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you 'cause you are my dream

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
If you had my child (Yodel-lay-ah)
You would make my life complete (Yodel-lay-ah)
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber, Chris Brown]
And baby, everything that I have is yours (Oh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry (Oh)
I'll be there when you're insecure (Insecure)
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you (Woah)
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
We're made for one another (One another), me and you (And you, and you, and you)
And I have no fear, I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, woah-oh
