Sorrows Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why do these people try to get me down
I don't need that shit right now
All I need is my spliff right now
And I need one hit right now
I know that I don't fit in
But I don't need your medicine
I know that I'm immature
All I feel is insecure
All I feel is all alone
They ain't got no home, so nobody's home
All my friends they all pretend, I'm lost again
But nobody knows I'm fine
They say its in my mind
[Hook]
Niggas can't match my sorrows
All of my emotions are bottled
Gotta have a spliff and a bottle
Tried to be the same but I'm not though
Gotta go get it my motto
I can see it all with my eyes closed
Let me tell you something that I know
Let me tell you something that  know

[Verse 2]
Why do I feel like I'm an alien?
And my shadow's my best friend
They want you to be like them
But I just can't be like them
Loved and lost and loved again
I will never love again
In my dreams my consciencness
Forget all that I must have lost my mind
Or what's left inside
Sometimes I lose my cool
But I found my fire
I guess that I'm not fine
It's not all in my mind

[Hook]
Niggas can't match my sorrows
All of my emotions are bottled
Gotta have a spliff and a bottle
Tried to be the same but i'm not though
Gotta go get it my motto
I can see it all with my eyes closed
Let me tell you something that i know
Let me tell you something that i know

I hate when everyday just feels the same
I need a change yeah
I know that i am strange i'm not the same
I need the pain
I don't want to be fine
I love whats in my mind

[Hook]
Niggas can't match my sorrows
All of my emotions are bottled
Gotta have a spliff and a bottle
Tried to be the same but i'm not though
Gotta go get it my motto
I can see it all with my eyes closed
Let me tell you something that i know
Let me tell you something that i know7Embed
