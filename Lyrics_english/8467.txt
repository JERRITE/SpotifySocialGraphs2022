Intro:
I imagine ahead and really what it will be I don't know
I keep acting because of waiting so much
My dream is great to keep myself with what I have already achieved
Asked what I wanted and twice I didn't think
‘Tô’ on the right track, that's why I started
The stones do not affect me, nor did I fall just stumble
Running after the time I wasted
Now it's my turn, they asked for the ball and I didn't pass
Verse 1
Inspiration comes with time, as clouds bring wind
Gray day or strong sun, dream ends up then wake up
For my hope there is no death, it is not enough just to wait
We have to overcome ourselves, to come heavy you have to have support
My 'Foot on the Scene' came to 'Trincar', envious will say it's luck
I live in the south focusing north, still missing a lot to toast
I open my eyes without remembering anything, and in the silent is still dawn
I always forget the TV on, there is more information by the sidewalk
Concentration at the time of play, I keep thinking that levada
I idealize more with more footprint (feels the impact of the gust!)
Each study has its object, I perform this project
Because my 'chat' is straight and straight, interpret and see that I'm 'I'm right'
I may not be the smartest, but if you don't see step, I get close
Not everything is lost is open, so much 'trampting' at the end
I can only take off if you have a foot on the floor, right and left more thousand will fall
Storm is my sound, not summer rain, you want breeze on the flow I send drilling!

Chorus:
I do my show thanks to the legacy that EAZY-E left us
Few believe in the promising future
Time does not stop is the compressor roll, king and teacher
Memories of the past comes as an aggressor
Proving, we are our own oppressor
Perfect past tense is what has already been forgotten
Gift is the new challenge to be overcome!
You Might Also Likeverse 2:
Everything you do will have your return
While you only scribble I already 'I'm' there in the contour
The climate is hot or cold, nothing warm
‘’ Be Call ’that this has just come out of the oven!
Better sleep remedy, exercise the neuron
Now says that I don't find that I kicked my demon
I represent the family I love, I do not use pseudonym
Solid work in my branch, speaks in the face and not anonymous
For every crazy crazy and does not disguise the street staring at me
Another rhyme comes out of the soul to the embodiment
What I feel, I don't wear belt and pants and the blouse are wide
With red wine in the tasting cup the bitter reality
That discourages, deceives, disappoints, surprises and shocks
I see souls exposed in the window shopper showcase
I value mine, more and more the wrist still pulsates
Your attitude is wrong and your thought insults you!

Chorus:
I do my show thanks to the legacy that EAZY-E left us
Few believe in the promising future
Time does not stop is the compressor roll, king and teacher
Memories of the past comes as an aggressor
Proving, we are our own oppressor
Perfect past tense is what has already been forgotten
Gift is the new challenge to be overcome!
Verse 3:
We always feel a moment in this absent gift
Captures the tear, turns the page to a shining future
Close to what we want to come across what we have
I gave my life, I launched the track until you get tired of listening to my demos
It was to overcome my fears, I sent out insecurity
I present myself in the community gaining more confidence
From Parthenon to Pinheiro, by east for something more
To the envious even apes are more rational
Globalizing everything through national rhymes
Influence is open book, change to please
Shows on stage are from passionate artists
Shortage of talented, millions of professionals
Both run, falls in the fuck, the blood drips, then dies
Noble heart, poor content, in this round you don't cover
The opponent's game, my role is that of emissary
Children stay in the nursery until the next birthday!

Chorus:
I do my show thanks to the legacy that EAZY-E left us
Few believe in the promising future
Time does not stop is the compressor roll, king and teacher
Memories of the past comes as an aggressor
Proving, we are our own oppressor
Perfect past tense is what has already been forgotten
Gift is the new challenge to be overcome!
