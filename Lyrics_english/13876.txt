​a woman is a god Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put it down now, let me see the cash
Spread your ass out, let me see the crash
Watch your world spin, I'ma smoke the stash
I'm a bad bitch, your bitch is bad
I'm a habit, you're a random girl
In the bathroom, snorting on the windowsill
You work in fashion, you got time to kill
It's a weekend but you feel weaker still
Watch 'em clappin', it's another show
Watch 'em glisten like their underwater gills are leaking
You in the mosh pit swirl and you geekin'
It's another world
[Chorus]
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god

[Verse 2]
Pick it up now, it's time to move
You look sluggish, you gotta make a bruise
They know your name now, you try to keep your cool
But the moment's passed, your momentum stills
In the back of the lanе, at the club on your block with no friends
Just your phone at your еar, try to make it seems like someone cares about you still
And that someone's really real
You're in the club now, dark room perfume
You're in love now with bein' you
Wow you move so gracefully like glass
Yeah, your feet can really dance

[Chorus]
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god

[Chorus]
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god1Embed
