Lyricsderriban Children's Game The doors
They enter violently
Tickets fly
Judgment looks
Mama shouts exclaiming clemency
An intrudes and paid penance
My prisoner, decay business
That scene throws me into crime
The child dies, innocence dies
Keep my house, raw adolescence
I have the right thing, I have the experience
A 38 without license
Distrust of fear
Fake appearances
I am aware of my science street
Of 100 grams of Falopa to a kilo
This works, ambition, forcefulness
In this game you can't sleep peacefully
Coca is a business that the government sentences
Nothing can be done
The street fills my soul
Innocence dies when dawn falls
I feel that the shadow of precious threatens me
And freedom moves away in a sigh of dawn

The business uploads tickets to the clouds
The limit is heaven, the BMW case
Envy looks accuse me in the neighborhood
Another level I notice the envy of other narcos
The telephone number is not worth the code
With Sigilio la Edoa plays her letter
You will never find drugs in my house
Coldness with a jacussi when kill
To Morocco travel frequently, 300 euros pollen
Pure essence dealing with men
There is no warning
No matter the hitman's name does not think
Some serious, millions of euros
Several months planning the movement
I study the failure, soundproof nights
My wife and children invade my thought
14 -meter gums arrive
Adrenalide explodes, anguish blinds you
They load the skirts rugen take off
All land fly and the guard approaches ..
You might also like anything can be done
The street fills my soul
Innocence dies when dawn falls
I feel that the shadow of precious threatens me
And freedom moves away in a sigh of dawn

A Civil Guard I don't know if it reaches 1500
What is your price tell me how much your silence costs
Drug and corruption, they live in the port
Senna monomotor, coca, talent
I feel power, I feel Licifer's thirsty breath
The price of power is to be a leader when my faith
I aim to fall prevents extremecer
Iron heart, steel curtain
The only thing that matters in business is money
I'm not guilty, I'm sincere
That is the government that cava the abujero
I'm cold, calculator
On this path you never have to lower your guard, distrust
I am a conjugator of any intruder
I don't hold my gaze in rear
Fear, blood for blood
Respect speaks for itself of a gangster
I do not want castillos partners in the air
I'm never going to leave my submissive freedom in anyone's hands
Nothing can be done
The street fills my soul
Innocence dies when dawn falls
I feel that the shadow of precious threatens me
And freedom moves away in a sigh of Albaembed
