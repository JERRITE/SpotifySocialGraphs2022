I thought I saw the devil this morning
Looking in the mirror
Drop of rum on my tongue with a warning
To help me see myself clearer

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today
[Chorus]
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times that I never could

[Verse 2]
My past has tasted bitter for years now so I wield an iron fist
Grace is just weakness, or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless

[Pre-Chorus]
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today

[Chorus]
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
(I'll be good, I'll be good)

[Bridge]
For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done
All these years, no, yeah
For all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should yeah
I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could38Embed
