Without witnesses Lyrics [saying]
'Tamo in the hero with you my world makes sense
Let's love without guilt, without witnesses
Let's put the world without sound

[Chorus]
If you do not see it, if I am with you my world is the other way around, if you are 'together there is no stress, it fell in love' like the first time
If you do not see it, if I am with you my world is the other way around, if you are 'together there is no stress, it fell in love' like the first time

[Saying]
'Tamo in the hero with you my world makes sense
Let's love without guilt, without witnesses
Let's put the world without sound
[Verse]
Long nights, the stars do not stop shining like the light of your eyes that love me 'dazzle
The love of your soul wants to perpetrate me
Let's escape 'of the world there is nothing more to wait
If I am more in love every day of your look '
There is no diversion on my way, I know who I want to be with, with the person who loves me and made me fall in love
I want to live all your dreams and want to wake up

[Saying]
'Tamo in the hero with you my world makes sense
Let's love without guilt, without witnesses
Let's put the world without sound

[Chorus]
If you do not see it, if I am with you my world is the other way around, if you are 'together there is no stress, it fell in love' like the first time
If you do not see it, if I am with you my world is the other way around, if you are 'together there is no stress, it fell in love' like the first time

[Outro]
Long nights, the stars do not stop shining like the light of your eyes that love me 'dazzle
The love of your soul wants to perpetrate me
Let's escape 'of the world there is nothing more than waiting might also likembed
