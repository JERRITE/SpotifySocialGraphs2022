Olly Olly Oxen Free LyricsSo
You wanted
That's what you get for wanting

You got it
That's what you get for getting

Forgotten
You're gardening a rotting bed
Of Reagan-era icons
So
Let's start it
Let's start it from the minute you felt it
You felt it like a prison, a panic
You felt it like that coffee scene
From Moscow on the Hudson
So
Be honest
It's not as if you're happy about it
It's not as if you're animatronic
It's not as if you couldn't
Cry out any time you wanted
Olly olly oxen free
All the people you will never be
Olly olly oxen free
Olly olly olly olly
Olly olly olly olly

Fate

You call it
You color it
The color you want it
You carpet it

That's awful convenient
You paint yourself a nice white room
With stripes and matching curtains
So

You forfeit
You cannot build a river across it
You cannot hold your own heart hostage
You do not have the strength
To gag yourself in every closet

The wrong place, wrong mind
Timing's always bad
You're such a sad case
Misplaced renaissance
Inventor of a worldwide
You might also likeHeartbreak, taking it in stride
Cause you're an expert
Aren't you?
Aren't you just a dime a dozen?
Murderous monosyllabic moron
With no sense of purpose

Working on your songs all night
To justify your worthlessness

To anyone who's watching
If they only saw your alter egos

Pretty in the shop windows
Where you got auctioned hours ago

Olly olly oxen free
All the people you will never be
Olly olly oxen free
Olly olly olly olly
Higher than the king can

See no evil, hear no evil
Capture me and throw the key
See no evil, hear no evil
Capture me and throw the key away
Throw the key away
So

It's over
You're lying in a coffin of clutter
Your father and your sister, your drummer
Are sorting through your Soft Cell tapes
And lifesaver collection, and you wonder
You wonder if you could've done better
You wonder if you should've surrendered
Before you learned that
Nobody actually wants a fucking martyr

Didn't you, didn't you, didn't
Didn't you see?
Didn't you, didn't you, didn't
Didn't you see?
Didn't you, didn't you, didn't
Didn't you see me?
Didn't you, didn't you, didn't
Didn't you see me?

Olly olly oxen free
All the people you will never be
Olly olly oxen free
Olly olly olly olly
Higher than the king can

See no evil, hear no evil
Capture me and throw the key
See no evil, hear no evil
Capture me and throw the key away
Throw the key away
Throw the key awayEmbed
