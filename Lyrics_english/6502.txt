Stomp Me Out Lyrics[Intro]:

*Whistling*

[Verse 1]:

I got the sunset in my pocket
And I'm not afraid to use it
Now I'm feeling superhuman
That's the point of the illusion
[Pre-Chorus]:

Like, I'm the man
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man on demand 'round here
I'm the man 'round here

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now

[Chorus]:

Shots fired on me
Shots fired on me
Can't stomp me out
You can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me

(Woah-oh)
*Whistling*
(Woah-oh)
*Whistling*
(Woah-oh)

[Verse 2]:

If you find a change of heart
I might forgive you
(I might forgive you)
But if you keep running that mouth
It just might kill ya
(Just might kill ya)

[Pre-Chorus]:

'Cause I'm the man
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man on demand 'round here
I'm the man 'round here
Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now

[Chorus]:

Shots fired on me
Shots fired on me
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me
Shots fired on me
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
No, no

[Interlude]:

[Pre-Chorus]:

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now
Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better shoot me now

[Chorus]:

Shots fired on me
Shots fired on me
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me
Shots fired on me
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
No, noEmbed
