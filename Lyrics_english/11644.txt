Baby Blue Shades Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey
Think about our better days
Think about you, those baby blue shades
That's when you told me
You hope that the old me
Might show up, I overreact

[Verse 2]
Hey
Think about walking away
Think about all of the ways I've changed
That's when you told me
You hope that the old me
Might show up, he's not coming back
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I
Can see the moon from my kitchen
But I
Cannot see through this decision
I close my eyes and crossed the line
Now I'm breaking out, yeah, you broke me down
Now I'm breaking out

[Chorus]
I'm breaking out

[Verse 3]
Hey
Breaking out to better days
Buy myself a pair of baby blue shades
Go on, forget me, I wish that you'd let me
You text me, I'm not writing back
I miss how you hold me, each kiss feels so lonely
But I know I'm on the right track

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I
Can see the moon from my kitchen
But I
Cannot see through this decision
I close my eyes and crossed the line
Now I'm breaking out, yeah, you broke me down
Oh, I
Can see my world in transition
And I
Can see the light I've been missing
I close my eyes and crossed the line
Now I'm breaking out, yeah, you broke me down
Now I'm breaking out
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out

[Bridge]
I miss how you hold me, each kiss feels so lonely
But I know I'm on the right track
That's when you told me
You hope that the old me
Might show up, he's not coming back
He's not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back (Hey, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I
Can see my world in transition
And I
Can see the light I've been missing
I close my eyes and crossed the line now
I'm breaking out, yeah, you broke me down
Now I'm breaking out

[Chorus]
I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out (Ooh, oh-oh)
[Outro]
Can't break me down
I'm breaking out (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Can't break me down
I'm breaking out (Ooh-ooh-ooh)1Embed
