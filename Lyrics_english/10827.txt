Joan of Arc on the Dance Floor Lyrics[Verse 1: AJ]
Every night, we walk the line
Every time, we step out of the shadows

[Pre-Chorus: Aly & AJ]
People pass by, always onto the next
With a dead heart
Yeah, they're full of regret
They got sad eyes, empty promises
We don't need 'em
[Chorus: Aly & AJ]
We don't stop
Until mascara's on the dance floor
We say, "No"
Joan of Arc is on the dance floor

[Verse 2: Aly]
At the stake, we don't fight the flames
Are you born in vain if you die a savior?

[Pre-Chorus: Aly & AJ]
People pass by, always onto the next
With a dead heart
Yeah, they're full of regret
They got sad eyes, empty promises

[Chorus: Aly & AJ]
We don't stop
Until mascara's on the dance floor
We say, "No"
Joan of Arc is on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Aly & AJ]
Knights in armor hide under eyeliner
Lights are low, the night will take us higher
Higher

We don't stop
We say, "No"

[Chorus: Aly & AJ, AJ]
We don't stop
Until mascara's on the dance floor (We don't stop)
We say, "No"
Joan of Arc is on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Aly & AJ]
Knights in armor hide under eyeliner
Lights are low, the night will take us higher
