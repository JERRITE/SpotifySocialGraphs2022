Donâ€™t Judge a Corpse by Its Toe Tag Lyrics[Verse: BEXEY]
I don't need nobody to tell me what I am here for
Counting money up while my tears fall
Breaking up out the 4 walls
I really want the whole world
London boy in LA
I'm used to the rain
Underage in the strip club sipping lemonade
I was confused as a kid playing hide and seek
Up in a house full of naked bitches
Momma was a female pimp
Flashback right here
While I'm staring and glaring up at these strippers
Breaking up out of my mind
Not running away from signs
Increasing the beam on the light
I'm looking around trying to find
Somewhere I belong
Forever in progress, fella
Stuck in the clouds like a GTA online error
No I don't know you
I take the lonely girl higher
She don't know my real name
Call me "Baby Cyrus"
Saying she don't feel pain
Angel, why you crying then?
This life is a real game
But you can't retry it, aye
[Verse: Ghostemane]

Aye, bitch don't be hitting my phone
Aye, bitch don't pull up at my show
Aye, found me a kawaii hoe
Aye, she gave me top on the top of a mountain
I'm lit like a BIC
I'm the G.O.A.T
Surrender life and I'm taking your soul
Shang Tsung with a young witch made her cum quick
Hand around her throat
Choke
Throw her in a moat

[Verse 2: GHOSTEMANE]
Pull up in a motherfuckin' Lyft I'm reminiscing when I used ta have a pretty red donk
R.I.P to the grand marquis
Baby, I miss you but it had to be
Now I'm in another state
Glowing like I'm indigo
Go with the flow
Hoes won't leave me lone
I'm a young G.O.A.T
Put a motherfucka thru the hole in the ozone
Neva gonna go back home
