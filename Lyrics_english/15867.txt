But not and not Lyricsya I can't touch you pichea that I'm no longer begging
In the street I feel thousands that I can experience
Although it goes well even though it goes wrong
I can't touch you pichea that I'm no longer begging
In the street I feel thousands that I can experience
Although it goes well even though it goes wrong

I don't want you to change your mind no longer
Because you hurt my heart
But not and no anymore, but not and not (x2)
To try better to follow it
Why do I resent you
You go calm and hesitate that many now line up
I don't want to continue to fool

Seeeeee that I don't want to know about you anymore
Seeeeee that I don't want to know about you anymore
Never

I don't want you to change your mind no longer
Because you hurt my heart
But not and no anymore, but not and not (x2)

But not because I have a new love
Now stay alone because your time already happened
To try what never worked
Tell me to follow if everything at all balio

With lies you broke the promises
All memories leave them on the table
Now you feel alone and full of sadness to continue !! (x2)

Bey Bey Bey !!

I can't touch you pichea that I'm no longer begging
In the street I feel thousands that I can experience
Although it goes well even though it goes wrong
You might also like I don't want you to change your mind
Because you hurt my heart
But not and no anymore, but not and not (x2)

Gotay the authentic
The concept
You know Pucca
Urba the sixth sense

I don't want you to change your mind no longer
Because you hurt my heart
But not and no anymore, but not and not (x2)

Bey Bey! Embed
