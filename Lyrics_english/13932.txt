Carry Yourself LyricsYour shoes are by the door
Two bodies lying on the floor
Saying goodnight, agree not to tell
Breathing fire, yes, 'best not to tell'
Well the child must lead the man
When the man chooses not to understand
But it's good to rock until your bodies come
Like it's the worst thing that you've ever done

But the only thing I know
Yeah the only thing I know
The only thing I know man
You're gonna have to carry yourself
Ooh ooh, ooh ohh
Oh carry yourself again
Ooh ooh, ooh ohh
Oh carry yourself, my friend

Things grow up until they peak
And then descend of which we rarely speak
And that descend of which we rarely know
I see two bodies in that afterglow

But the only thing I know
Yeah the only thing
Yeah the only thing I know man
You're gonna have to carry yourself

Come back and get right
Come back and get real
Come back and get right all that you feel
Come back and get right
Come back and get real
Oh baby, carry yourself
You gotta carry yourself

I see the moment weigh on your face
Collapsing words of pleasure and place
What to protect, what to conceal
What to project, what to reveal
And you say that you ain't doing it again
Well here you are, you're doing it again
And it's hard to know what anything's worth
When it's the worst thing but it doesn't hurt
You might also likeCome back and get right
Come back and get real
Come back and get right all that you feel
Come back and get right
Come back and get real
Oh baby, carry yourself
You gotta carry yourself

Ooh ooh, ooh ohh
Oh carry yourself again
Ooh ooh, ooh ohh
You gotta carry yourself, my friend

But the only thing I know
Yeah the only thing
Yeah the only thing I know man
You're gonna have to carry yourselfEmbed
