​​bad days Lyrics[Verse 1]
You used to love me on my bad days
When the sun wouldn't come out
When I was called to make a statement
I'd wait for you to figure out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why what you said just a minute ago
Triggered feelings from before
From the time you don't remember
Well I forgot, but can't let go
[Chorus]
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would

[Verse 2]
I picked at all that I could think of
I guess I picked that up from you
No one could make me feel so useless
I know I did it to you too

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why cuts so deep every word that we speak?
Triggers shit we never thought
I still remember all the good times
If not, I'll recreate 'em all

[Chorus]
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
If I could, I would
Oh, if I could, I would

[Bridge]
Yeah, I try
But we're in the same crowd
Always at the same scene
So I don't know how
I'm supposed to act fine
When we used to be burning love
That died
Colder than ice
Why am I surprised?
But I guess that's how
I guess that's how we do it now

[Chorus]
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would
If it was easy, I'd forget about you, baby
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
Oh, if I could, I would
If I could, I would8Embed
