Nostalgic Night Lyrics [Bigton "Night Night" Lyrics]

[Verse 1]
I miss you to see you. I miss you
I don't know if I miss it at that time or you
Even if I think of you alone
It becomes more and more blurry

[Verse 2]
Wherever you walk, are all your traces?
Why are we all talking about the song I listen to yeah
If you can reverse the time
Did you draw the future where you are
[POST-VERSE]
The night without you
I couldn't speak
I still have left
Night night night night night when the night night comes

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to fall asleep next to you
I will return it back then I'll tell you everything
I love you, I can't even want to be good
Make me even harder

[Chorus]
Night you miss more
Late Night, Late Night, Late Night
Nostalgic night
Way Back, Way Back, Way Back
Night without you
I will be your right place
I always RIGHT THERE, YEAH
I'm gonna be right there, right there
Nostalgic night

[Verse 3]
I really tried
Chest
Even the heart is sinful
Cold night wind
A chestnut with my scattered tears
Asrai embroidered parting like a star
The darkness is darker
How do I miss you so much?
You might Also Like [Verse 4]
Why is all your warmth in the space without you
Why is there no moment without you in my memory yeah
If you can stop the time
Can I stay at that time

[POST-VERSE]
The night without you
I couldn't speak
I still have left
Night night night night night when the night night comes

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted to be together every day next to you
If I meet you now, if I meet you at that time,
I love you, I was happy that moment I was happy
Why didn't you know then

[Chorus]
Night you miss more
Late Night, Late Night, Late Night
Nostalgic night
Way Back, Way Back, Way Back
Night without you
I will be your right place
Always RIGHT THERE
I'm gonna be right there, right there
[OUTRO]
The night without you
The night without you
Night Night Night 1EMBED
