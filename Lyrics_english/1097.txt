Better Now (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a few days
Nothing's the same, you're a stranger
But in my heart
I know that there's no one that could know you better
Maybe you're right, but I need time for me
To write this chapter on my own
So many fights, so many nights I couldn't hold my anger
I'd sleep in my car and wonder if I get to see you later
I'm done with the lies, done with the trying
So I guess you're not my problem now
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just want to hold you close
But I just fuckinâ€™ let you go
Mistakes are irreversible
So I think this might be better now

[Chorus]
I don't want to drink tonight
But I need something to disguise
This pain that sits beneath my eyes
And in my mind
I think this might be better now, better now, I'm better now
Ohh, no, no

[Verse 2]
I wish you had faith
But I was faced with an ultimatum
You knew I had dreams
So who were you to tell me to forget them
And now it all seems
Your world is crashing down
You're blaming me for all that's been done

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just want to hold you close
But I just went and let you go
Mistakes are irreversible
So I think this might be better now
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't want to drink tonight
But I need something to disguise
This pain that sits beneath my eyes
And in my mind
I think this might be better now, better now, I'm better now

[Bridge]
So I guess you were a liar
You said you want it all, want it all
But you didn't have that fire for us
And when the truth comes I'm a danger
And I won't hold you back, hold you back
Now we've lost what still remains of our trust

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just want to hold you close
But I just went and let you go
Mistakes are irreversible
So I think this might be better now

[Chorus]
I don't want to drink tonight
But I need something to disguise
This pain that sits beneath my eyes
And in my mind
I think this might be better now, better now, I'm better now
Ohh, no
[Outro]
'Cause I just want to hold you close
But I just went and let you go
Mistakes are irreversible
So I think this might be better nowEmbed
