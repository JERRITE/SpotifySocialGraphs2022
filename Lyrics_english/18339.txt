Professional Love Lyrics[Intro]

[Chorus: Haile]
I put my suit on so I look classier (Fashion)
Loud pack make you happier
She take any plantain, not the ackee, ah
Browning with the batty, ah (True say)
If I give you love (Only)
Professional love
If you give me love (Only)
Professional love

Before we get it started
It's not plantain, baby girl, it's plantain (Ha)
She said, "Where you tryna party after this?"
I said, "Girl, what you're really askin'?"
If it's cool (It's just me and my girl)
Who the hell else could do it? I do it myself
Turn it up, shut it down, I ain't booin' a girl
It's all out (All out)
You know I'm doin' it well

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Rei]
She wanna travel 'round the world (True)
Prada and Chanel (Mm-hmm)
Can I get the tip? (Shh)
You can keep that to yourself
(Let me put my suit on)

[Chorus: Haile]
I put my suit on so I look classier (Fashion)
Loud pack make you happier
She take any plantain, not the ackee, ah
Browning with a batty, ah (True say)
If I give you love (Only)
Professional love
If you give me love (Only)
Professional love
I put my suit on so I look classier (Fashion)
Loud pack make you happier
She take any plantain, not the ackee, ah
Browning with a batty, ah (True say)
If I give you love (Only)
Professional love
If you give me love (Only)
Professional love
