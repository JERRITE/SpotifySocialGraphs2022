Starting Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a girl I find in my reflection
She is smart and kind, don't need protection
She's a warrior, and she is waiting for you
Just around the bend

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where every day you're a hero that lights up the dark
Where you lead with your courage and dream with your heart
Where there's a whole new world
[Chorus]
Starting now
There's no room left for wondering
Got a new vision of yourself
And she's who you wanna be
Starting now
Tell the moon that you're on your way
Tell the stars you will be right there
Say goodbye to yesterday
Starting now

[Verse 2]
The girl next door
That's how they see me but I'm so much more
I'm rising from beyond the sea, I've grown
Into the unknown
Up to where I see the light

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna take on my dreams with compassion and pride (Oh yeah)
I am courageous and strong with my friends by my side
Who knows how far I'll go?

[Chorus]
Starting now
There's no room left for wondering
Got a new vision of yourself
And she's who you wanna be
Starting now
Tell the moon that you're on your way
Tell the stars you will be right there
Say goodbye to yesterday
Starting now

Starting now, I'm starting now
I'm starting now, I'm starting now
Save the day, break the curse
I will always have a heart of gold, gold
There's a girl I find
Her story is a tale as old as time

[Chorus]
Starting now
There's no room left for wondering (No, no, ooh, ooh, woah)
Got a new vision of yourself (New vision of yourself)
And she's who you wanna be
Starting now (Starting now)
Tell the moon that you're on your way
Tell the stars you will be right there
Say goodbye to yesterday
Starting now

[Outro]
Starting now, I'm starting now, now
I'm starting right now, I'm starting right now
Oh yeah, I'm starting now3Embed
