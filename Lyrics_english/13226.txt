Darker Than Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were darker than death
When I spoke to you last
You were darker than death
When I spoke to you last
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did?
Was it something I said to you, darling?
I'm sorry I never meant to
Stay out so late
I got carried away
[Verse 2]
Was it something I said?
You left me crushed
Were you losing your head
Over something that you lost?
And did you feel it too?
When we both went blind
You wouldn't even look me in, oh darling
You wouldn't look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Was it something I said?
Was it something I said?
Was it something I said?
Was it something that I said?You might also likeEmbed
