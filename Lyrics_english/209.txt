Pink riches and shit, you know what I'm sayin'? (What's happenin'?)
Pink colors and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hustle with you, invest in you, you know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)

Big boss nigga in a Phantom with a bitch in the backseat (Woo, woo, woo)

Cut off one bitch, more hoes comin' like a track meet (Phew, phew, phew)
Yeah, she a ratchet ho, nigga, ratchet attract me (Lil' gangster)
Got a boutique, gave her two-fifty, she ain't have to ask me
All in the pussy, no rubber, I just hope she took a plan B (On God)
Stand up nigga, need a stand up bitch, ain't no playin' me (Ain't no playin' me)
I'm in the end zone, never in the friendzone, bitch can't fan me (Touchdown)
And her ex can't stand me (And he shouldn't)
'Cause I'll make his bitch do somethin' that he couldn't
Yeah, I know that pussy is power (Power)
She know that pussy is ours (Ours)
Get her wet, she gon' run like a shower (Swish)
Lay in that pussy for hours, yeah

Yeah, I'm up now (Yeah, I'm up now)
Yeah, I'm up now, yeah (Boo, boo)
I can't come down
I'm too far up now, yeah
