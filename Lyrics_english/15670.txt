I would leave everything lyrics [lyrics of "would leave everything"]

[Verse 1: Joel Pimentel]
I have tried almost everything to convince you, uh
While the world collapses everything, here at my feet, Yeah
While I learn from this loneliness that I do not know, Woah
I ask myself again perhaps if I will survive

[Pre-Caro: Zabdiel de Jesús]
Because without you I have a frozen and empty conscience
Because without you I have realized love that I will not be reborn, Yeah
Because I have gone beyond the limit of desolation
My body, my mind and my soul, they no longer have a connection
Oh, I swear that
[Choir: Erick Brian Colón]
I would leave everything for you to stay
My creed, my past, my religion
After all, you are breaking our ties
And you leave this heart in pieces
My skin would also leave it
My name, my strength
To my own life (no)
And what else to lose
If you get along at all my faith
What would not leave

[Verse 2: Richard Camacho]
And the 'good' thing 'hurts more when you are absent
I know that and too late to remedy
I don't have a good value of ten thousand excuses
When I definitely know that now you go
And although I can't change it, I will keep waiting for you
In case one day you love me 'see well

[Pre-Caro: Zabdiel de Jesús]
Even if I repeat that I am dying day by day
Although you are also dying, you will not forgive me
Although without you it has reached the limit of desolation
And my body, my mind and my soul, have no connection
I keep dying

I would leave everything for you to stay
My creed, my past, my religion
After all, you are breaking our ties
And you leave this heart in pieces
My skin would also leave it
My name, my strength
Even my own life
And what else to lose
If you get along at all my faith

[Chorus: Joel Pimentel]
I would leave everything for you to stay
My creed, my past, my religion (my religion)
After all, you are breaking our ties (Yeah)
And you leave this heart in pieces
My skin would also leave it
My name, my strength
Even my own life
And what else to lose
If you get along at all my faith, oh

[Outro: Erick Brian Colón]
