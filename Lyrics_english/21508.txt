What Youâ€™ve Done to Me Lyrics[Chorus]
Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Fine boy (Don't know what you, don't know what you)
(Don't know what you, don't know what you)
Fine boy (Don't know what you, don't know what you)
(Don't know what you, don't know what you)
Fine boy (Don't know what you, don't know what you)
(Don't know what you, don't know what you)
Fine boy (Don't know what you, don't know what you)
[Chorus]
Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Don't know what you done to me
Oh, oh
Don't know what you done to me

[Chorus]
Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

[Verse]
Feelin' some kind of way
About you makin' me weak
You're enticin' me
I feel it's best if I stay
Away from you and your charm
So you can't do any harm, boy, unburden me
