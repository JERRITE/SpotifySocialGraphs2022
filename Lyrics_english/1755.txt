Hyde out (Try Again) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I take it personal
I deserve to know 'cause we were super close
But I feel you changin
You ain’t call me, baby
Ain’t been on me lately
And I’m goin' crazy
Thinkin' that I’m to blame
And for God sakes (Sakes) my mistakes (Oh)
Done caught up and come between us
We need a clean slate
A fresh page
If we part then it’d be for a good reason
(Oh, let it be)
(For all the reasons, girl, let’s try it out)
(Oh, let it be)
(For all the reasons, reasons)
[Pre-Chorus]
I confess, I ain’t perfect (No)
Cravin' my intentions, I just want what’s best
If we’re in this, girl, I won’t say no
We can try again if we really want it
I confess, I’m not perfect (No)
Cravin' my intentions, I just want what’s best
If we’re in this, girl, we shouldn’t slept

[Chorus]
We should try again if we really want this
What’s best, what’s best, what’s best (We should try again, oh-oh)
What’s best, what’s best, what’s best (We should try again, oh-oh)
What’s best, what’s best, what’s best (We should try again, oh-oh)
What’s best, what’s best, what’s best (We should try again, oh)
We should try again, oh-oh
We should try again, oh
We should try again, oh-oh
We should try again, oh

[Verse 2]
And I made it to Miami
Do that make you happy?
Don’t worry, you got zaddy, here now
In la casa with amigos tryna make this free throw
We’ve been on a T.O., timeout
It’s your birthday, birthday
Take a shower with me
Spend a long time, come here
Gettin' drunk with me
Gotta came up with something, now you tryna see
Oh girl, I’m tryna see what’s up for my feelings either

(I can’t be friends when it comes to you)
(I can’t be friends)
(I can’t pretend)
I can’t be friends when it comes to you
(Can’t just be friends)
(Can’t just pretend)
(I can’t be friends when it comes to you)
(Can’t just be friends)
(Hard to pretend)
I can’t be friends when it comes to youEmbed
