La Chanty (Remix) Lyrics [lyrics by "La Chanty (Remix)"]

[Intro: Archangel & threat]
I don't know I forgot how I met her (how?)
Quickly with her I wrapped me
Fast was fre'ca (I know yes)
Dancing at the disco (also VI)
Dejamo 'The dry bottle (yup)
MATAMO 'The full night, ah (hahaha)
At that night nothing was missing (I know no)
It became better than I expected and (Wao)
[Choir: Archangel, Menazzy & Archangel]
I really surprised when I saw that the chanty killed
The Weed took me from the hand and told me that she wrapped him (ah)
How can I tell you to tell you that I want to have it? (Oh, Yeah)
And what do you tell me if you start your WhatsApp?

[Verse 1: threat & archangel]
Historical moment, in which I never reserved
She knows and applies it; The point '
That was crazy, more than his way of being
It was a pleasure to have turned on 'together'
There was never formality, although I think that love
Well, I think it was something nice with alcohol
We lived 'La Real, Calmito', in a resort
No parabamo '' E smoking, the Gold almost ended
And I don't change it for anything
That moment when there was no word ', only gestures and look'
I even got around because I agreed that I kissed her
Everything was seen as drama 'of those who give on TV
From then ', impossible to leave' to see
We are corduroy ', she and' my friend
I dedicate time to my pretty chanty
Beautiful moment I will have for life (ah, ha)
When I was surprised

[Choir: Menazzy & Archangel, both]
I really surprised when I saw that the chanty killing (Wao)
The Weed took me from the hand and told me that she wrapped him (Ajá) herself (Ajá)
How can I 'do' to tell her that I want her '? (Oh, Yeah)
And what do you tell me if you start your WhatsApp?
