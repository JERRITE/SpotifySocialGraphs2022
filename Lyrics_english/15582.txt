Escape lyrics ["escape"]

[Intro]
(Although you run, you hide, you can't escape
Although you run, you hide, you can't escape)

[Verse 1]
Hey, you and I is like that
Go up and go down but one day at last
Without wanting to do us well
When one has said it ends
A voice says no and stays
[Chorus]
If you decide to leave me
I am not going to beg you
There you if later
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape

[Verse 2]
Today if you go you will see
That is not so easy to forget
Know well, know bad
How but it is so real
That in the end the rest does not care

[Chorus]
If you decide to leave me
I am not going to beg you
There you if later
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape
Even if you hide you
You can not escape

You will run
You will hide
But you won't escape
You will run
You will hide
But you won't escape
Today a voice says no and stays
Run and tell goodbye

[Chorus]
If you decide to leave me
I am not going to beg you (not plead)
There you if later (if later)
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape
(You Can't Escape My Love)
If you decide to leave me
I am not going to beg you
(You Can't Escape My Love)
There you if later
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape

[Outro]
You Can Run, You Can Run
You Can Run, You Can Run
Run and tell goodbye
Run you'll see
You will never escape
Run and tell goodbye
Run you'll see
You will never escape
You Can Run, You Can Run
Although you run, you hide
You can not escape
Although you run, you hide
You can't escape
