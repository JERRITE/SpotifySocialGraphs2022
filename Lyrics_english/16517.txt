Anyone Can See LyricsIf I could, I'd try to know you
And I would never let you go, oh, no
But if I were to make you
A bit of time it would take to say someday

Anyone can see (why I love you)
What you mean to me
Anyone will know
My love is there waitin' just for you

The other night when you left me
I cried, wishin' you would say (you'd say) you'd stay
Maybe I don't have the strength to tell you I need you so
I guess you'll never know
Anyone can see (why I love you)
What you mean to me, yeah
Anyone can tell
I fell for you so easily, yeah

Anyone can see (why I love you)
What you mean to me, yeah
Anyone can tell (can tell)
I fell (I fell) for you (for you)
So easily (so easy)
So easy (so easy)
Easily

(Anyone, anyone)
Ooh, anyone
Anyone can see
(Anyone)
Ooh, anyone
(Anyone can see)

Anyone can see that, can see that
Can see that, can see that I love you
(Anyone, anyone)
(Ooh, anyone)
I love you, I love you, I love you
(Anyone can)
