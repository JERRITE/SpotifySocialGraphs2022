Let Go for Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky, and started walking
Leaving our footprints on the ground
It might be a prayer
Or maybe a piece of conversation
Wherever we go we make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know, is we're here tonight
Turn up the lights
[Chorus]
Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life, and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

[Verse 2]
I wanna drive
I wanna drive into the open
Looking for reasons I can't find

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know, is we're here tonight
Turn up the lights

[Chorus]
Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
I need to it let go, let it go
Before we're gone, gone, gone

[Breakdown]
So, I call your name
The only thing I know is that I need you here, or you'll be gone forever
All that I know, all that I know
Is that I need you here or you'll be gone forever
Turn up the lights
Turn up the lights

[Chorus]
Let go for tonight, baby
Let love in your life and be strong
Let go for tonight, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?
I need to let it go, let go
Let it go, let go
Let love in your life, baby
Who needs sleep tonight?

[Bridge]
I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
I need to it let go, let it go
Before we're gone, gone, gone
[Outro]
Fell from the sky
We fell from the sky, and started walking
Leaving our footprints on the ground14Embed
