Too Soon Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said your old shit never worked out
But it's over and you're hurt now
You deserve more, now let me show you that something, ha (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that this might sound too soon but I
Just gotta tell you this one thing, and I

[Chorus]
I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like
Don't think for one second it's you, girl
Though I know you might
Insecurities stay in the dark
Kings don't show them light
And I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like
[Verse 2]
I know your exes might have been lost
But they lost you too, and that's their loss
You need some difference, and let me show you you're worth it (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that this might sound too soon but I
Just gotta tell you this one thing, and I

[Chorus]
I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like
Don't think for one second it's you, girl
Though I know you might
Insecurities stay in the dark
Kings don't show them light
And I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like (Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that this might sound too soon but I
Just gotta tell you this one thing

[Chorus]
I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like
Don't think for one second it's you, girl
Though I know you might
Insecurities stay in the dark
Kings don't show them light
And I've been in love too, don't worry
I know what it's like (Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh)You might also like4Embed
