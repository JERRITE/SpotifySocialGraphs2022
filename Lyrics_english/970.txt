[Intro: Jhay Cortez]
D-Note is on the beat
You know what I want to do (-te, -te)
Tell me how much do I have to wait
How many days, how many hours to see you? (-Te, -te)
If I have my friends and you have your friends
But I turn off if I don't turn to you (JA)
I've been thinking about you for a couple of days
Hey, and I just wanted to tell you
[Pre-Caro: Alex Rose]
I feel alone if you are not here (OH)
Is that none does it like you (no)
If I'm beautiful, I just think about you
Eager to call you and tell you

[Choir: Alex Rose, Myke Towers & Miky Woodz]
I want to fuck you, give you, tell me if you don't
You want me to touch your parts and get you to '
I want to take you to my room, do it without a condom
She likes to mix codeine and oxycodone
Baby, let yourself be carried away by the OG (Peru)

[Verse 1: Miky Woodz]
UH (Miky Woo ')
I know he likes it when I do to him 'because he arrived (Yeh-Yeh)
Hey, he did not eat shit, the panti 'took off (no, no, no)
Do not know so much that the positions anticipated them (You know it)
After I gave her, her boyfriend vetoed him
When I'm eating it, I don't believe 'in brake (no)
I said: "I Wanna Fuck you", that land is already mine (ey, ey, ey)
Quiet, baby, I am not one of those who water poison (no)
To your buttocks I made a sold out because of milk you fill them
As much as they try to copy you, there is no one to deceive me
Not even if your perfume
After they bathe (hol 'up; no, oh, oh)
First said:
"You owe me a dust and I want me to get out" (What you say?)
Then he said:
"Miky, Bájale, that the toto burns", i'm done

Melee and my sweat falls on you
And I Wanna Fuck you and you set me 'flow showcase

[Verse 2: juhn "the All-Star"]
I am a beautiful, already you know me '
None makes me fucking what you do to me '
I can't find who makes me come like you still
I remember when the Police fell at home (Wuh-Wuh)
For how hard you shouted when I put it in
And while a phillie turned on
I did 'a couple of Threesome'
And we also threw orgies (hahaha)
I get up thinking about you, baby, I don't lie (I lie)
And I call you when I want to fuck (ah)
And get your hair while talking to you Suciería '
Today I want to give you and tomorrow repeat it again ("The All-Star")

[Verse 3: Alex Rose & Ñengo Flow]
Send me the pin that I am going there (huh, eh)
You put the role that I put the Weed (I put the Weed)
I don't know what you made to be like this (oh)
Addicted to your buttocks like Codeine (like Codeine)
I have experienced with others, but I never find
Someone like you, with those movements
With you I dared to throw it inside
Like when I put you on the seat
Baby, you are the favorite (favorite)
The only one that makes me come if it shouts (if you shout at me)
I'm already coming to eat you complete
Is that this bug already needs you y- (Ñengo Flow)

Eager to call you and tell you

She likes to mix codeine and oxycodone
Bryant Myers

[Verse 4: Bryant Myers & Ñengo Flow]
Baby, Ponte Linda, today I want to fuck you
I'm going to do you hard until you surrender '(ey)
Marimba and Codeine, with Sprite Pa 'that endorses you'
Vamo 'to beautiful, with you I want to wet the nugget (ey)
Scapella without a helmet, the grass inside 'the bottle
Chingamo 'in a cabin, by Maya or by Añasco
To 'wet the hot pant, well Bellacos lo' do '
You like to open the bread, so that I put the hot dog
He tells me not to stop, that he will come (come)
I fuck me as Demonia in bed (bed)
You and I only ', where nobody will intervene (intervene)
Whenever I come, I swallow it (Real G4 Life)

[Verse 5: Ñengo Flow]
Mami, arrives' on me, to go far from here (far from here)
She just wants to fuck with Real G (the Real G)
Baby, look at me well, I know you are looking for the same too
You treat me badly, but inside 'and your evil I feel good
It can't be that you have
Light in my arms, without clothes you come
Mommy, don't surprise yourself, kiss again and have it again
I will make you pledge you '
I don't vo 'let you sleep'
Sick of love, I give you heat to come back '

[Verse 6: Myke Towers]
Baby, I Wanna Fuck You as Akon (Yes)
You know that I deserve it
She codeine to the soda
He says that I make it perfect (huh, huh)
She became addicted to sex
I mammated it for the express
When I'm alone, I think about you
I had to get you out of Friendzone
I want to give you day and night
In the room or in the car
And he stayed in my polo clothes, your perfume Dolce (ah, ah, ah)
I still remember the poses
She is Freaky, asks me to spose

[Coro: Alex Rose, Myke Towers & Noriel]
I want to fuck you, give you, tell me if you don't
You want me to touch your parts and get you to '
I want to take you to my room, do it without a condom
She likes to mix codeine and oxycodone
(Hehe-hehe, no-no-noriel)

[Verse 7: Noriel & Jhay Cortez]
To 'what she likes, I know (aha)
Prefers to fuck instead of shoe and wallet
Codeine mixture with Pecocet (AH)
And I will give him until Don Francisco Diera (Wuh)
I don't understand how it happened, maybe it was a déjà vu (ah)
Whenever chingo with another, I think it's you (I don't know)
He's bastard, I played with the girl
And that all started with a beautiful Snapchat
And who would say that I was going to Juquiar?
That the days in you was going to think
Tell me if you feel the same to know if I'm wrong
Or if you want now to go looking
(Jhay-Co, Jhay Cortez)

[Verse 8: Jhay Cortez & Casper Magic]
He told me: "Without a condom and also without conditions"
Today wants to fuck, he doesn't want to have relationships (no)
I do not ask him for her that she doesn't question me
To you it is that I want to give you, although the others are crowded
Baby, tell me when (ey)
I wanted to dance like stripper and rode the tube in the room
Whenever I charge, with you spending '
And we end up in my bed, drinking and smoking (Pasto)
Mixing
These people throw you, Baby, but not 'tan or billing
Whenever I charge, with you spending '
Drinking codeine and setting a Blunt (casper), follow me

[Verse 9: Magic casper]
Baby, I want to give you but without a condom (Wuh)
I brought you codeine mixture with cyclone (ah)
I am not coming, I came, I threw my oxycodone
Forniquemo 'See you tomorrow and forget about that bastard (of that bastard)
Because he doesn't know how to give you (ah)
He fights you with Cojone 'and not to' e mistreat (mistreat you)
Baby, Yo very rich vo 'a chingarte (wuh)
Until you shout my name, but I never love you

[Pre-Caro: Noriel & Alex Rose]
