Baby (Baby, baby)
I want you to leave but you stay
My brain and my heart ain't the same
So will I let you in?
As long as you won't do this to me again
Baby (Baby, baby)
When I left my heart in your hands
You left me scarred at the dance
Baby, let's not do this again
[Verse 1]
We're just friends
Picked you up with a smile on my face
Wanted to end the night at my place
We need to, baby (Baby)
But I always know how this ends up you gon' play me
Ooh yeah, baby
Felt like I got left out the prom with my date
You didn't read all the signs in my face
That tonight was supposed to be our night (Our night)
Yeah, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, would you look at thе time? (Look at the time)
I'm racing against it
Your hеart to my heart (To my heart)
Come place it against it
I stare at your soul (Stare at your soul)
I'm facing temptations (Temptations)
I wanna do right, we both want the sensation

[Chorus]
So can we
Play with the stars tonight?
Can we make them all align?
So what's it gonna be? Yeah
Cause tonight's the night, so, baby
Can we (Can we?)
Play with the stars tonight? (Play with the stars tonight)
Can we make them all align? (Make them all align)
So what's it gonna be? Yeah (What's it gonna be?)
Cause tonight's the night, so, baby

Why the fuck'd you come? Just to show face?
It drives me crazy (Baby)
It doesn't matter what I do, you still gon' play me

You wiped the smile up from my face, lil' baby
If you can trust me, we'll be alright
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, would you look at the time? (The time)
I'm racing against it
Your heart to my heart (To my heart)
