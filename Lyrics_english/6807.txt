Midnight in My Mind Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Ooh
Yeah
Mmm
Uh

[Verse 1]
I guess when you alone you can really feel the vibes
Yeah
I was in love with your mind
It was one sided I was never on you mind
Yeah
But you was always on mine
Time goes by I was getting high
Tryin' to get by
Hard
We've been every night never keep quiet
I ain't never thought that you'd ever switch sides
Feel like such an idiot I never see signs
My niggas told me to be careful I never listen
And now I feel like I ain't care for no pot to piss in
I threw my love up in the air for her, she was distant
I never thought that she would cross me like she a christian
So why you tryin' to call now
All my problems in the blunt when I roll now
Blowing gas everything is moving slow now
Cold now
[Bridge]
I was hurting
You would never when I listen called out
Baby
You said you fell in love with what you fall out
Baby
But I ain't got the strength to even crawl out
Baby
I still be thinkin' 'bout you when you going out
Baby
Love is uglier the more you growing up

[Verse 2]
I ain't seem to find you in the love that I was lost in
Wasn't prepared and now we ended up exhausting
Weekends you know the boys getting high
They kill but they still make you feel alive

[Outro]
Yeah
Make you feel alive
Anything to make the time fly
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Anything to make the time fly
Yeah
Yeah
