Ordinary Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Louis sneakers, Kylie lip kit, Cartier bracelet
Could live without fancy things
Lovin' life in my ripped jeans
Takin’ Snapchat selfies
I celebrate every day, trying to be

[Chorus]
Just an ordinary girl in this extraordinary world
I’m a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinary girl
[Verse 2]
Eyes on the big stage, mind on the test l take
Livestream study breaks
Long nights make longer days
Some day I wanna do big things
But I don’t gotta be Superman
Stars are just dreams, work hard and reach
And you can do anything

[Chorus]
Not an ordinary girl in this extraordinary world
Not a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinary girl

[Bridge]
Keep your eyes ahead and don’t look back at what you’ve been
If you keep going, time will tell you when it’s right
Make your philosophy to live in belief of what you dream

[Chorus]
Not an ordinary girl in this extraordinary world
Not  a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinary girl
