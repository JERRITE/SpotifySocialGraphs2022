Look at me (remix) Lyrics [letter from "Mirame (remix)" ft. Casper Magico, Darell & Myke Towers]

[Intro: Darell, Nio García]
Oh oh
Yeah
Here we go again, hah!

[Bridge: Nío García, Rauw Alejandro & Nío García & Darell]
What happened (what happened; that is like that)
It was that the thing about 'one day died (pa' who knows'; one day he died)
It can have another and I'm still (I'm still; by law), baby
It will lose you if it leaves you alone, Yeah (ha-ha), baby
(Everybody Go to the discotheque!)
Is that with me you are going to to'a
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
Look at me, he admits that he can't 'forget that he sees'
He as I don't part, tell me if I do it 'another sees'
Look at me, he admits that he can't 'forget that he sees'
He as I don't part, tell me if I do it 'another sees'

[Verse 1: Myke Towers]
Look at him when I am doing it
Mommy, you are going crazy
Your beautiful I turn on, is wild, but I defend myself
There is other pa 'metron' time
So kiss me, but this time
If I call while I do it, tell him
You well know 'that pa' you will always be
And that pa 'your' fresh 'I will lend myself, Yeh-Yeh
I arrive and remove the clothes, the whiskey to the rock, the fashion of Europe
I touch it below the conforter when it is wrapped
She knows that I act, the baby does not snore
And don't forget 'how I start, in your room I emphasize you
Among others, I always stand out
And they will give them a heart attack if you find out that you are from Michael
When I put Psycho, Yeh-Yeh-Yeh

[Verse 2: Darell]
You want with me and I want with you (that's it)
Pa 'The people you and I so' friend '(hah!)
But in bed you and I are enemy '(OH-OH)
You tell me 'if I stop' or continue (stop that shit)
I say, I say to come to you, I don't force you (what knows')
Your weak point I get it (hah!)
I give you so hard that I even fatigo
And you are the one who hosts me
Because I don't harass you, I'm still (liste to me, liste to me)
Gallinitas and eat wheat (What that fuck?)
That ass is the one who lighes it to you (hah!)
Fucking more garments than mys
And as pa 'lo' time '' and the father
Vamo 'to give him punishment (here we go again)
And give your bags, please (oh my God)
That before the airport I go pa'l mall (i like it your booty, mom)
From Santo Domingo e 'El Resort (Hi Sweety)
And I will give you where the sun does not give (you and me in Disney World)

And I like To'a, his body knows me to Passaa
She goes to me whenever she's going back
And ends up running to him
And you want to look for you in La Cayenne
I put you 'a kidnapping where you' the only hostage
What you feel 'for him died, Amen (Amen)
And in your message it was written: "Pa'l Cajo!", Give them Send
And every time I look for you
And I drive, on the way I can see you
I don't know who taught you that trick
Mommy, it's not fair, with you I look for death

[Chorus: Nio Garcia & Rauw Alejandro]
And look at me, he admits that, he can't 'forget that he sees'
And as I do not part, tell me if I do it 'another sees'
Look at me, he admits that he can't 'forget that he sees'
He as I don't part, tell me if I do it 'another sees'

[Verse 4: casper]
(Nosotro 'Somo' Los Magico ', baby; casper!)
Tell me if we do, baby, look at me (baby, look at me)
I remember when he told me ': "Baby, kill me (baby, kill me)
Find me for hair and mistreat me
Graze it by neck, the bed, daddy, love me
Tell your cat that with me is that you 'Tás Juqueá'
That from here next year I have Boqueá '
That you move my rich ass, that's what you're cowing '
It became complete in R.D., 'Tá well enchuleteá'
I want to do it as you did to me, behind you I'm going
I don't know what happened to me later, and I'm going-go-go
I want to do it as you did to me, behind you I'm going
I don't know what happened to me later, and I'm going-go-go
[Verse 5: Rauw Alejandro]
She asks me to punish her
'Tá put to do bad things with me
Although sometimes we cross the forbidden (Yeah)
We only remain as friends (Yahoo!)
If she asks you to punish her
That is to give a rake to the Shorty
You're leaving with me after this party
Is that he doesn't know how to work that body
You tell me, so you tell me
Remember your beautiful to let me know
For my bed again I baptize you
When you want me to do what I already did to you
If she asks you to punish her (huh)
That is to give a rake to the Shorty
You're leaving with me after this party
Is that he doesn't know how to work that body

[Verse 6: Lenny Tavarez]
I didn't want it to be a Booty Call, but
I want me to call me to take two tramadol
Anesthesia for love
But if he leaves you alone, he will pay for the error
You want action, but he doesn't challenge you
For your addiction I have the recipe
Tell me how much do I have to wait for you to be complete
I know that it always falters that we veem '
Pa 'mi who realized the nebuleo (hopefully)
He has those who send, I have those who give
Tell him to leave the eagerness, that you are only my fan
You want action, but he doesn't challenge you
For your addiction I have the recipe
Tell me how much do I have to wait for you to be complete

[Chorus: Lenny Tavarez]
Look at me, admit that you can't forget that time
As I do not part, tell me if I do it again
