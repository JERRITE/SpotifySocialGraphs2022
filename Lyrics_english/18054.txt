How Do I Lose You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I was falling 'til I hit the ground
And was it love if you can never hear it make a sound?
'Cause if you said we're losing time, I would've made it count
But look at us now
Mm

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hold on tight
To what's not mine
Can't we decide what to call it?
[Chorus]
So how do I lose you if I never had you?
Loving you like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing real to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I lose you?

[Verse 2]
I didn't noticed that I missed you 'til the hurricane
Remember islands on the pavement in the pouring rain
We stood together slick and tethered 'til the weather gave
Now it's not the same
Mm-hmm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hold on tight
To what's not mine
Can't we decide, should we call it?

[Chorus]
Oh, how do I lose you if I never had you?
Loving you like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing real to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I...
You might also like[Bridge]
Keep on hearing something
When we've both said nothing?
What's the point in bluffing
From a hundred miles away?

[Chorus]
So how did I lose you - I never had you
Loving like pretend
How do we end this if it never started?
Nothing real to forget
'Cause I'm having such a perfect time
Clinging on to every blurry line
Tell me if you aren't even mine
Then how do I, how do I lose you?

[Outro]
Oh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm-mm
Oh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, oohEmbed
