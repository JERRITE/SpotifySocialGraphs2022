Let’s Skip to the Wedding LyricsYou got that look in your eyes
It’s about that time
Let’s skip to the wedding
Let’s stay past the ending

You got that look in your eyes
It’s about that time
Let’s skip to the wedding
Let’s stay past the ending

I’m gonna be good to you
If you’re just good to me
Imma be good to you
If you’re good to me
You got that your look in your eyes
It’s about that time
Let’s skip to the wedding
Let’s stay past the ending

You got that your look in your eyes
It’s about that time
Let’s skip to the wedding
Let’s stay past the endingYou might also like1Embed
