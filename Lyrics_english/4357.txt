Take advantage of Lyrics ["Take advantage" ft letter. Daddy Yankee]

[Pre-car: Jory]
Tell me, why so alone, who do you wait for?
Tell me what you need and without fear I will give it to you ('toy pa' ti, baby)
Tell me, why don't you explain? Calm my anxiety
Tell me, why so beautiful and with no one to accompany you?
(Jory, dy, c'mon)

[Chorus: Jory, Daddy Yankee]
And take advantage that I am here
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you for one night
And give it, take advantage that here I am
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you one night (Ma, Ey)
[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
And give it, take advantage that here I am
I am leaving
Don't think about it anymore, baby
But come, come, see that the day is today
Take advantage that I'm here
I am leaving
Don't think about it anymore, baby
But come, come, see that the day is today

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
Let chemistry make the trance, there maybe there will be no other chance
Your Daddy is reported and will give you a good advance
Romance will be rich, none will be within your reach
Remember that my account has a great balance
You already know, baby

[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
Keep my way, I have what you want '
That I will be here a woman, eating with kisses (Daddy)
Just come with me, cool, I tell you
Just let me see dawn, eating kisses
(Daddy Yankee and Nova & Jory, Shorty, Ey)

[Chorus: Jory]
And take advantage that I am here
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you for one night (say jory!)
And give it, take advantage that here I am
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you for one night

The wait is over, your Rufi√°n arrived here, mommy
The one of the Tickets, the Millonari '
I look for you at night, I take you for a walk in the car
I take off the brooch, come and let go
Give it, take advantage of the chance, hard until you tire '
I'm not going to stop, mamita, come hagamo 'a romance (Yeah)
I am what he needs 'and as much as he wants'
I border on me to go with me to see you

[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
Keep my way, I have what you want '
That I will be here a woman, eating with kisses (Daddy)
Just come with me, cool, I tell you
Just let me see dawn, eating kisses
(Daddy Yankee and Nova & Jory, Shorty, Ey)

[Pre-car: Jory]
Tell me, why so alone, who do you wait for?
Tell me what you need and without fear I will give you
Tell me, why don't you explain? Calm my anxiety
Tell me, why so beautiful and with no one to accompany you?

[Chorus: Jory]
And take advantage that I am here
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you for one night
And give it, take advantage that here I am
After today there will be no other chance
I saw you so alone that I did not concentrate
I don't want so much, I just ask you for one night
