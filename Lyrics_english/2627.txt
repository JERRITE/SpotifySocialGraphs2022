Signs (Eden Prince Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh God, it's the same old song
If I was smart, I'd run
But that would be so dumb
'Cause oh Lord, whenever you're near me
Your mouth is poetry and I start to believe in love
Just you and me, I tell my friends bout what we could be
But the signs you've given aren't clear, it gets a little crazy around here, cause I

[Chorus]
I don't want to be the one who says it first
And I don't want to be out here looking so thirsty
And now all I'm sure of this thing fucking hurts
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
But it's not, not, not еnough to know you're mine
Not e-know you'rе mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine-ine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're (Not e-know you're)
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e, not e
[Verse 2]
Over and over again now
Reliving all my fears
Wondering why I'm here
Laying in your bed sheets
With nothing else between
But a bunch of question marks
Promises in the dark
We focus, you and me, I tell my friends 'bout what we could be
But the signs you've given aren't clear, it gets a little crazy around here, cause I

[Chorus]
I don't want to be the one who says it first
And I don't want to be out here looking so thirsty
And now all I'm sure of this thing fucking hurts
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
But it's not, not, not enough to know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not enough to know you're mine

Not, but it's not, not, not enough to know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine-ine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're (Not e-know you're)
Not e-know you're mine, not e-know you're mine
Not e-know you're mine, not e, not eYou might also likeEmbed
