How to look at you Lyrics [letter from "how to look at you"]

And how to look at those eyes that leave me in January
When I know they are not mine and I die
Fate does not matter to us

I don't get the words to express me that I love you
I don't know how to explain that you make me feel
As if it were summer and winter there was no
As if you stop
And with that smile that changes life
You looked here and I can't stand
That you are not the one who loves me

And how to look at those eyes that leave me in January
When I know they are not mine and I die
Fate does not want to see us pass

And how to tell you that I don't want
May this love be passenger
And suddenly one day, I wait for you
Fate does not matter to us

The words do not come out, mamacita
To tell you that I love you

And you know'

I want to express my love

Because I want to
Give yourself a love
That is firm and durable

The words do not come out, mamacita
To tell you that I love you
You Might Also Likey I'm going to wait for you

I want to express my love

When really loved
There is no time

The words do not come out, mamacita
To tell you that I love you

And how to forget you, my love

I want to express my love

If life taught me
What is going first

Because you are my priority
You are my only love

Perucha sauce

Josimar and his yamb√∫

And how to forget those eyes that leave me in January
When I know they are not mine and I die
Fate does not have to import us
