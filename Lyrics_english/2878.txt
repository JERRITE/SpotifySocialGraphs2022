You Should’ve Known Lyrics[Chorus: Dax & Hopsin]
You should've knew I was coming (You should’ve knew I was coming)
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming (You should've known)
You should’ve knew I was coming (You should've knew I was coming)
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming (You should've known)

[Verse 1: Dax]
Yeah
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming (You should've known that shit)
Came up from nothing, cleaning up toilets in Kansas, my nigga, was fucking disgusting (Facts)
Thinking you bluffing
Thinking you rapping when niggas like us are not in the discussion (Facts)
Fucking destruction
Way that I hop on a beat and destroy it without interruption
Yeah, uh
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming!
Came up from nothing, cleaning up toilets to live in a mansion and fucking up budgets
All the corruption
Clouding my brain had me feeling like I was just trapped in a dungeon
Fucking combustion
Way that I'm growing and killing these rappers I feel like I’m huntin’ (Facts)
It feels like I'm fighting a battle and war with myself
And I’m rapping on beats, I don't see no one else
Got the shit off the mud, I don't need no one's help
If you ain’t showing love then you fiendin' that feel
Got my soul on my body, ain't really for sale
Got a bitch, she a thotty with tits and a tail
Moving A$AP like Rocky, I'm going retail
Niggas carbon, they copies, they do it for deals
Yeah
Niggas didn't know I was coming, now they do
I been doing work (Yeah), times two
Nigga, you silly, Caillou
Nigga, you short, haiku
Nigga, we lit, not you
Nigga, we blessed, ACHOO
Nigga, I'm next (Yeah), it's Dax!
[Chorus: Hopsin]
Hmm, you should've knew I was coming (Well, hello there, haha, yep)
You should've knew I was coming (You should've known, damn)
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming
I was away for a minute but now that I'm back, you are done with
You knew I was coming (Lights out, okay)

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Look
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming
You wouldn't want it, I'm sick of your shit so get used to the plumbin'
You just a luncheon, it's nothing for you to get druggin'
Your liver removed from your stomach
I'm feasting on you like a buffet
I'm Lucifer's cousin, it's pulling up in a convertible coupe and I'm stuntin'
Your carcass is glued to the front end
I'm fucking up crews in the dozens
I leave 'em with crucial concussions
Who getting punished?
Take off your jewels and then run it
I'm acting a fool in the public
Check out the drip (Hot)
I keep the juice in the oven
Life is an everyday struggle but keep to yourself, homie, you shouldn't butt in
Who's interrupting?
You should've knew I was coming
I'm a gamble like dice roller
Hit it blindfolded
I, been a fool, my mind's colder since
Middle school, had psychosis
If y'all see me outside roaming then I prolly wouldn't leave those blinds open
I'm known to hit like a cyclone
And strike hoes at any given time so
See my soul has been light polled for a price though
It was sold like twice bro, to be the ill-mind maestro
If I die no telling what side that I might go
I'm nobody's disciple so blackout your windows and stay in the house with the lights low
It's gonna be pleasant when watching you die slow
Haha, bitch

Uh, you should've knew I was coming, yeah (Surprise, nigga, huh)
You should've knew I was coming (You should've known, damn)
Bitch, you should've knew I was coming
I been away for a minute but now that I'm back you are done with
You knew I was coming, run it20Embed
