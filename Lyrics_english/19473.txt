FALL BACK Lyrics[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that (All that)
She text me sayin' that it's over in all caps
It's gnarly

[Chorus]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me sayin' that it's over in all caps
Now I'm takin' Xanny with a Perky, it's all bad
Damn, love burns like a furnace, so fall back
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me sayin' that it's over in all caps
Now I'm takin' Xanny with a Perky, it's all bad
Damn, love burns like a furnace, so fall back (Fall back)
[Verse 1]
Last night, I had my first show, it was too rad
Even though I only made a hunnid in all cash
Whole crowd jumpin' to my music and all that
Rockstar status, baby, that's what you call that
How come when I call, baby, you never call back?
Heartbreak Hotel, that's what you call that
You got a new one and I'm all sad
I got hoes, but they're nothin' but fallbacks
I take drugs just so I can not feel bad
Already dead, so the mission accomplished (Accomplished)

[Bridge]
I'm already dead so the mission accomplished (Accomplished)
I hope that you feel bad

[Chorus]
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me sayin' that it's over in all caps
Now I'm takin' Xanny with a Perky, it's all bad
Damn, love burns like a furnace, so fall back
Need a flight overnight to Paris and all that
She text me sayin' that it's over in all caps
Now I'm takin' Xanny with a Perky, it's all bad
Damn, love burns like a furnace, so fall back (Fall back)

That's my ambition, baby, you'll never kill that
Cupid tried to get me, baby, I told him, "Get back"
I'm ballin' on these niggas, a mismatch
I know that you feel that
You're so fake, you don't know where the real at (Real at)
