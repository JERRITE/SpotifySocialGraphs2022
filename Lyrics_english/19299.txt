​auburn skies Lyrics[Chorus]
Why you acting righteous
Tears all on her white dress
Young an went astray
Got too caught up with these vices
I don't wanna die young
Pain I'm tryna hide from
Memories like auburn skies, in my head

Why you acting righteous
Tears all on her white dress
Young an went astray
Got too caught up with these vices
I don't wanna die young
Pain I'm tryna hide from
Memories like auburn skies, in my head
In my head
[Verse]
I see your picture right now it's a melody
Melody all in my head
All of the toxins
All of the toxins
Blood on my hands
The sky turning red
I'm stuck in cycles that only rеpeat
While, gravity hold me down
I'm lost morе than I’m found

[Chorus]
Why you acting righteous
Tears all on her white dress
Young an went astray
Got too caught up with these vices
I don't wanna die young
Pain I'm tryna hide from
Memories like auburn skies, in my head
In my head

[Bridge]
In my head
In my head
Over and over again
You might also likeIn my head
In my head
Over and over again

In my head
In my head
Over and over again

In my head
In my head
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Why you acting righteous
Tears all on her white dress
Young an went astray
Got too caught up with these vices
I don't wanna die young
Pain I'm tryna hide from
Memories like auburn skies, in my head

Why you acting righteous
Tears all on her white dress
Young an went astray
Got too caught up with these vices
I don't wanna die young
Pain I'm tryna hide from
Memories like auburn skies, in my headEmbed
