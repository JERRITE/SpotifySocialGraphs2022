Is This What It Feels Like To Feel Like This? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ecstasy, tragedy, doom
I summon monsters to the back of your hotel
I think I might have arrived too soon
I hear the birds harmonise between your yells

[Chorus]
I thought it would be more my style
A new bag and an overnight kit
I only ever did it once in a while
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
[Verse 2]
I hear the daffodils are all in bloom
I summon monsters to the door of your hotel
I might disturb the sign on your room
And smash through with the weight of the Liberty Bell

[Chorus]
I thought it would be more my style
Champagne in an overnight kit
I only ever did it once in a while
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?

[Bridge]
And the world is a glass and it's overflowin'
You can self-improve, but you're still on your own
And who am I to tell you what I think you should do?
Oh, who am I, but just a third wheel in the room?
And we terrify each other and act obscene
The world is just a used pinball machine
As strange fluids occupy the shine on your lips
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?

[Outro]
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?You might also likeEmbed
