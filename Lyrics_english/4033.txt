The kiss Lyrics [lyrics by "El Besito"]

[Chorus]
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico

[Verse 1]
I change you for a kiss all my life and my heart
I am willing to give you the love that was born only for you
I come from a long way full of penalties and sufferings
But he has given me the feeling that I will be happy
[Chorus]
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico

[Saying]
Love is priceless and I change it to you for a little kiss
It doesn't matter if it's that little boy
The important thing is that I kiss me

[Chorus]
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico
Oh, baby give me a kiss
It doesn't matter if it is Chiquitico

[Chorus 2]
Girl of my feelings
White Rose Capullito
Oh, baby of my feelings
White Rose Capullito

[Verse 2]
In you I have hope and I know that my time is not lost
Because God put you on my way to be a happy man
Don't get fearful and don't let time go by
I want you to give me a kiss or if not I give it to you
