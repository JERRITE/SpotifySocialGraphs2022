Translationssepañolfrançaisthe Weeknd - Montreal (Deutsche übersetzung) Montreal Lyrics [Intro]
Drop girls
Drop girls
One day it's you we'll leave
Drop girls
Drop girls
One day it's you we'll leave
Yes, but I cried that day
No, I was not crying
No, I was not crying
Yes, but I cried that day
I will not cry
I will not cry
[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as i make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so mary ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i'm alone
So if i said that i won't call
The Lying Comes Natural to Me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)

[Verse 2]
HAPPINESS EXIST WHO YOU DON'T KNOW A THING
So i hope you do think this song is about you
And only i can know how close you cam
But baby i'm a pro
I love it when they come and go
You might also like [Chorus]
It could have went so mary ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i'm alone
So if i said that i won't call
The Lying Comes Natural to Me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)
If we just Went (drop the girls, drop the girls)
If we just Went on (one day it's you we will leave)


[Outro]
Drop girls
Drop girls
One day it's you we'll leave
Drop girls
Drop girls
One day it's you we'll leave
Yes, but I cried that day
No, I was not crying
No, I won't cry (I won't cry)
Yes, but I cried that day
I will not cry
I will not cry (I will not cry) 148EMBED
