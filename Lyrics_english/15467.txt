I'm going to continue lyrics for the bed my body rests
I feel tired, I'm thinking about things
Life has treated me well
I will not deny it, it has been wonderful
I come from a place in the northwest of the country
Proud Mexican root
I started from zero, more than one scar
I already cried, I suffered, today I try to be happy
My mother's memories fill my head
He arrived from school and food at the table
My sitting father, with a smile
Seeing their children eating in a hurry
Mass Sundays
Then I dirty the shirt on the street
The wind and its breeze that caresses us
Taking care of the sun that beat us
I am the three of a united family
I am the three of four who left home one day
In search of my dream, be independent
I have an angel who takes care of me
It is always pending
They have been too many emotions
They are situations, in different positions
Without explanation
I don't forget who I am, where do I come from
Where am I going, what do I have
Always with your forehead high, it is the question
If I have really offended them, I apologize
They are tears and laughs, the passion feels
It looks like an action movie
They are kilometers that separate me from mine
I try not to get into trouble
From here a affectionate greeting I send you
It's for you, that's why I smile
To all those who are not here
Seeing how I have grown up
The friends I lost during my way
I'm going to follow (Follow)
I have no more time to suffer
I already understood, finally
There are no errors that I do not plan to repeat

To all those who are not here
Seeing what I have lived
The friends I lost
Those who do not go with me
Let them go, like this
I have no more time to suffer
I already understood, finally
It's time to stop pretending

I like laziness much more
When I was in the prepa I did not give it the importance
Cashier telling the money I saw the profit
We were the first with elegance
In an era without social networks
Without a cell phone, those material things
In a world that follows animals
Hospitals medicines are over
I no longer find the door, I don't know what I want to study
To the park to which I was becoming a bar
I freed me from that as soon as I started rapeling
They scold me, it is not a hotel to rest
At that at the door I hit him a whore
I look in the mirror, I'm not a failure
It hurts so much not having given you a hug
Say goodbye to you, tell you how much I miss you
You Might Also Likeno is that he has lost the faith
I can't believe it
Love is pain, I know
It is worth losing

It is not that he has lost the faith
I can't believe it
Love is pain, I know
It is worth losing

To all those who are not here
Seeing how I have grown up
The friends I lost during my way
I'm going to follow (Follow)
I have no more time to suffer
I already understood finally
There are no errors that I do not plan to repeat

To all those who are not here
Seeing what I have lived
The friends I lost
Those who do not go with me
Let them go, like this
I have no more time to suffer
I already understood, finally
It's time to stop fingerbed
