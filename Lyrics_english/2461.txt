Turn Up The Love Lyrics[Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove

[Post-Chorus: Kev Nish]
Just turn it up now

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Get get it poppin', hop the molly
Dirty bass, we so body body
Too legit, we can't quit the party
Super freaks, no Illuminati
So one, two, hit the booze
We on YouTube, nothing to lose
So let it loose 'cause the sheep don't sleep
Like pop pop pop pop
Alright
[Pre-Chorus: J-Splif]
Drop low to the L-O
V-E gotta get more
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give
Turn it up
Turned up you don't hear me no (Hear me no)
Here's some love for your stereo (Stereo)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give

[Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
Go ahead now flos your love like a heart of gold
Dirty bass to bake a tussy roll
If you don't low on the floor
I got a crew that will handle that cookie jar
Damn girl, I ain't tryin' to be rude
Spread love like a guest list you plus two
That's what you call a move
Like pop pop pop pop
Alright

V-E gotta get more (Get more)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
I got nothing but love to give (Turn it up)
Turned up you don't hear me no
Here's a love for your stereo (Stereo)
So clap your hands, clap clap your hands
Like pop pop pop pop

[Bridge: Kev Nish]
Turn me on like this your song
Dirty bass got love to give (Turn it up now)
Mad monopoly all night long
Dirty bass got love to give
Yo, let me see that grill from here to here
So much love in the atmosphere
The good times roll with me right here
I got nothing but love to give

[Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love
Turn up the love
We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove
We are one tonight
And we're breathing in the same air
So turn up the love

We're turnin' up the lo-o-ove
