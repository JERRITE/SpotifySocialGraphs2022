This Is An Emergency Lyrics[Intro: Matt Bowman]
Don't make me go
Don't make me go home
Don't make me go
Don't make me go home

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to the people I don't know from back home
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
[Refrain]
Please don't do it, let's not do this now
Something's happening; can't we stay, somehow?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to the people I don't know from back home
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
'Cause I'm not here to reflect you
I wish your friends would leave me alone
And I could never connect to the people I don't know from back home
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergency
This is an emergencyYou might also likeEmbed
