The life that goes lyricsla life that comes and I am leaving

And it always happens, it goes life and I'm going
And always on time, there is no time if it comes and I go
From heaven to the ground goes
Two moons against the wind a salt kiss (a salt kiss)

I am not for a single moment
I'm going to live on the game of thinking
If I think I don't feel just
The life that comes and I'm leaving. (Ah Ah)
The life that comes and I'm going (ah ah)
While I go back the earth I'm leaving
While you love, love life I am leaving
The slow wind goes a thousand seas
In silence a lime kiss (a lime kiss)

I am not for a single moment
I am living from the game
To think if I think I don't feel just
The life that comes and I'm going (ah ah)
The life that comes and I'm going (ah ah)

And if I feel I feel
That the story that is going
And if I find myself
I find that the life that comes goes
And I'm leaving

The life that comes and I am leaving

The slow wind goes a thousand seas
In silence a lime kiss (a lime kiss)

I am not not for a single moment I am doing
I'm living the game of thinking
If I think I don't feel just
The life that comes and I am leaving
You might also like I am not for a single moment
I'm going to live on the game of thinking
If I think I don't feel just
The life that comes and I'm going (ah ah)
The life that comes and I'm going (ah ah) embed
