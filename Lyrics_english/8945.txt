Whatcha Gonna Do About It LyricsI want you to know that I love you, baby
Want you to know that I care
I'm so happy when you're 'round me but I'm
Sad when you're not there
Sing the song now!

(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Ohh yeah
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Tell the truth
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
She's so nice
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
I want you to give your sweet, sweet kisses
Want you to hold me tight
I want you to come whenever I call you
And let me walk you home at night

(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Eh Yeah
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Please answer my question, baby!
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
She's so nice
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)

I want you to know that I love you, baby
I said this before but I care
I'm so happy when you're 'round me but I'm
Sad when you're not there
Here they come again!

(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Ohhh yeah
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
'Cause I'm so crazy
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
You're too much
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Ohhh yeah, baby
(Whatcha gonna do about it?)
Oooh, ow
