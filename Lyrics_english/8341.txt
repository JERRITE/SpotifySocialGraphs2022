All Because Of You Lyrics[Hook: Bandit Gang Marco]
Oh, you were my baby
Now I am here all because of you
I can't trust another girl all because of you
It's really driving me crazy
My hearts cold all because of you
I can't love another girl all because of you

[Verse 1: Bandit Gang Marco]
Can't tell me why relationships don't work out
When I tell you to keep it real the time is now
I gave you what you need so why you can't treat me right
You know I couldn't put nothing past you
That's all the girls could say
Try to hold you down and ride with you
You left me out in the rain
I feel (feel) feel (feel) so much pain x4
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bandit Gang Marco]
Everything you said and did girl I believed it
I thought you'd leave my heart in bits and pieces
They were intentions baby for you and only you
We were on different pages
That shit ain't even cool
I wish I didn't even meet ya'
If I could I wouldn't need ya'
Fuck you don't even need you
Anyway, Anyway
I can find another girl like you
Any day, Any day, Anyways
I feel so much pain, so much pain, so much pain x2
Having trust issues and I never ever even fuck with you
(Oh ah)

Oh, you were my baby
