And if you stay, what? LyricsSÃ© you are tired
You've had a long day
And you want to turn off the world
I know that all day
I have counted the hours
To have you close
I know you sometimes think
That you have been wrong
Steps in your life
I know that sometimes I think
That if I don't have you
For more steps
I know I want you to be
The first thing you see
When opening my eyes
And if you stay tonight
And if you hug me in bed
And if we finally face so many
Of being the witnesses of our mornings
I am willing for my part
To undress your thought
To be a settler of each corner
Be your rock and your wind, end and beginning
And if you stay tonight
And if you stay, what?
When you cross the door
Leave your doubts behind
And your regrets
What to think
If we are the whim
Of what we feel
When you wake up
And you see me smiling
It will make sense
All the time gone
I have wasted
Before being with you
I just want you to be
The first thing you see
When opening my eyes
And if you stay tonight
And if you hug me in bed
And if we finally face so many
Of being the witnesses of our mornings
I am willing for my part
To undress your thought
To be a settler of each corner
Be your rock and your wind, end and beginning
And if you stay tonight
And if you stay, what?
And if I explode you, what?
And if I understand you, what?
And if I feel you, what?
And if you stay tonight
And if you hug me in bed
And if we finally face so many
Of being the witnesses of our mornings
I am willing for my part
To undress your thought
To be a settler of each corner
Be your rock and your wind, end and beginning
And if you stay tonight
And if you stay, what?
And if you stay, what?
And if you stay, what? You Might Also Likeembed
