Chase the Light! LyricsTe wo nobashita no ni mada todokanai
Yogoto seiron iya ni naru
Benri na iiwake wo haimawaru shoudou

(From) time to time, I feel like running away
Trying to face away from this situation

Feel so lonely in this world

But for me to live I have to decide my own way
Take it easy
It's gonna be alright
Have faith and trust what a person you are
In times when you feel lost believe yourself
Overcome all the enemies
Are you ready? Let's go!!
Chill out and be easygoing sometimes
That was what you've told me in bad times

Karamaru ito hodoita toki ni waraitai kara
Mayoeru hibi mo tashikameru
Sagasenakute me wo sorasu kedo
Kimi nara dekiru sono te wo nobase

Fog hanged over
Making me blind
I cut through the air with my hand

And then I realized I ran into a wonderland filled with mysteries
I knew if I kept running without stopping I will someday find the way out from here

Take a look around
Each one of us shares different thoughts and features
No one is the same and that's what makes us the only special

Spring has arrived
Season of new life has come
Sou toumei de mabayui ashita e
We all face and go through tough moments
But with the help of others we gain the power to stand up againYou might also likeEmbed
