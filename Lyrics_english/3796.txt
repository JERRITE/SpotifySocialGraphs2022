[Hook]
Y'all gone (Pt) make me act a fool, (Pt) up (B) in (Pt) here, (B) up (B) in h! (Pt)
Y'all gone (Pt) make me lose my (Pt) cool, up in here, (Pt) up in here! (Pt)
Y'all gone make (Pt) me bust a (Pft) sweat, up in here, (Pt) up in here! (Pt)
Y'all gone make (Pt) my fingers snap, (Pt) up in here, (Pt) up in here! (Pt)
[Verse 1]
Why should I battle a crusty old man
When you can't even defeat a little weak Peter Pan
Ya (B) lucky this is (Pt) only a beat-box (Pt) battle
Cause in a real battle (Pt) I make ya feel rattled

[Verse 2]
Look at him, (Pt) he only got one planet, (Pt)
I got the whole Galaxy (Pt) under my dependence, (Pt)
You're gonna beg (Pt) when you (B) bleed and die, (Pt)
As you realize (Pt) destiny arrived
