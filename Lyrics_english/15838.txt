And I can only love you lyrics [chorus 1] 
 So pure life and you 
 So full of peace 
 And I can only love you 
 You fill my life with light 
 You fill the sky the earth and the sea 
 And I can just love you 

 [See 1] 
 There is no heart that resists it, girl 
 But if you cry I want my eyes 
 Follow each tear of you 
 And until I lose sight of it 
 [Pre-chorus] 
 I look at her and look at you 
 Use my soul like a kite 
 And I die of desire 
 To find the form 
 To show you the soul 
 And I can only love you 

 [Chorus 2] [x2] 
 How will that be 
 If even when the moon comes out 
 And give in my window 
 I can't stop loving you 
 We have laughed and cried the three 
 I want to give you joy 
 I want to give you something important 
 And I can only love you 

 [Chorus 1]
