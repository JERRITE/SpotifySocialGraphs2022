Gon’ Blow Lyrics(It's the beat)

[Intro: Cakes Da Killa]
Ju-just pump the beat (x11)
I'm screaming

Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low now, keep it low x2
[Pre verse: Cakes Da Killa]
Young God on the go
Make that money on the block or the pole
Let me make it hot, you bitches can't cope
Backside on slip on your waist like so (hold up)
Leave a nigga on hold
Pull the car up fast if you really tryna roll (like hmm)
This year I’m gon' blow
Act like you ain't know

[Verse 1: Cakes Da Killa]
It's a mix of spots in my sit ups
Diggin in my poom poom
Tryna get my back stuff
Drink a couple shots
See how quick a bitch act up
Look at me to them
They really can’t stack up
Cuffin to blockin, just whippin and woppin
Keep a rotaysh while I'm sippin and shoppin
We'll never sit, won't be forgotten
I'm here to make it hot from the womb to the coffin
You ain't doing shit though (stop!)
I ain't think so
Mouth so slick like some motherfucking Crisco
Trynna go platinum like the waves up on 'Cisco
Double that, triple that, trappin’ out the bando
Stack that, flip that, truffles on the mantle
On vacay, tan, and down in the Sandal
With a good trade built tough like Rambo
Cakes the bees' knees, knees
Make them dollars I’ll advance on their feet
And I book down, foreign breeze on his cheeks
Bossin’ on a piece, cuz he really want a piece
But what type of cunt do you want me to be?
What type of stunts is you praying to see?
I can make it blaze [?]
Weak in the knees, best believe
I'm out of your league when I wolf on the ease
Sweatin out your socks and your crisp undies
Lost your style trynna get it like me
Just a minor pet peeve when I'm feeling sexy
Track stars in my DM's, trynna run game
[?] no swervin in my lane
Shorty been the same, hot shit maintain
Got a pain in my brain and some fire in my veins like

(It's the beat)
Ju-just pump the beat (x4)
Ju-just pump the beat (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up now) (x4)
This shit gon blow, this shit gon (x4)
This shit gon blow, this shit gon blow
This shit gon blow, this, this

Ah, act like you ain't know

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Get hit like a gun
Bi-bi-bitch I'm the one
Ass weigh heavy like a ton (boom)
They be throwing hella shade on my sun
Bitch, I really came for the kiki
Lotta sugar in the tank, call me sweet tea (sweet!)
I be looking for the guys with the big meat (oh)
I know he wanna do me in my Vicki's
Bitch I done came through servin
I'm so tight like a motherfucking virgin
Killing these hoes, p-p-purgin
Boom boom ka-da ka-kya, I'm splurgin
Look at me I'm so dope
If you can't take then your ass gon choke
In other words, bitch, gag
A bitch like me just drags
Been on the scene with a walk so mean
Been near the shit [?]
Lockdown, all the way
To my girls, round the way
To the girls, round the globe
Nah I ain't never gon’ fold
Uh, I lead you bitches
I am the boss, I don't need you bitches
Yo, Cakes! I said Cakes, what's good?
Been around the world but I came from the hood
My attitude like ”Yo, I wish a bitch would
Wish you'd listen up so it's really understood
Ha, I don't play all day
Gotta taunt n*****, tell em swing my way
Uh, I can be what you want
A classy lady or a ratchet cunt
[Outro: Cakes da Killa]
Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low, keep it low, keep it low now
Keep it low now, keep it low x2Embed
