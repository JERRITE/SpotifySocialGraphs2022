TranslationsEspa√±olBelong to the City Lyrics[Verse]
If I knew (If I knew, yeah)
I was wastin' my time (I was wastin' my time, yeah)
Would end up wastin' my time (Would end up wastin' my time, yeah-eah)
With all these shoulda, coulda, wouldas (With all these shoulda, coulda, wouldas)
I'm in her ear one time (I'm in her ear one time)
Tryna tell her how I rhyme (Tryna tell her how I rhyme)
But she heard it all (But she heard it all, yeah)
I know she heard it all (But she heard it all, yeah)
Girl, I could change your life (Change your life)
But you heard it all (But you heard it all)
But you heard it all
I'm from the city
Where you ain't gotta love too long
You ain't gotta love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
So don't believe what they say
Just believe what they do to ya
You can't tell these bitches nothin'
She belongs to the city, oh
They gone, they gone, they gone
They was lookin' for somethin' (For somethin')
She belongs to the city, oh
Oh, yeah, you know (Yeah)You might also like52Embed
