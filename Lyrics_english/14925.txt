Falling to Pieces Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say come, I go
When I'm high, you're low (Low)
Taking shots on the front line
Not out of love, but we out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a fool but so am I (La-la-la)
I may be twisted, you're unkind (La-la-la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La-la-la)
You do the same thing every night
[Chorus]
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces one by one
Falling to pieces
One by one

[Verse 2]
Can a silver lining turn gold?
Another story untold (Told)
Why do we even try?
Not out of love, but we out of time, whoa-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a fool but so am I (La-la-la)
I may be twisted, you're unkind (La-la-la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La-la-la)
You do the same thing every night

[Chorus]
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces one by one
Falling to pieces (La-la-la)
Falling to pieces (La-la-la)
One by one

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a fool but so am I (La-la-la)
I may be twisted, you're unkind (La-la-la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La-la-la)
You do the same thing every night

[Chorus]
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces come undone
Oh, we're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces one by one

[Outro]
Falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
One by one
