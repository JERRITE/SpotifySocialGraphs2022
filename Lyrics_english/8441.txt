Hee loved you oooo oo
HEY! I am the diva! The horseta!
I loved you, I cried you! .. Beibii ..
And life I have given you!

And Tuuu, you make fun of Mii! ..
You make me suffer ..
You lie to me

I'm not from iron! ..
I am a woman! .. And now you will understand!
When you see me with Ell!

You suffer! How I will see it!
And in your life nobody will keep you!
What you did pay me!
If in my hands I had a dagger I would use it! .. And life would take you
For leaving me so alone and empty!
For my mother that I would drag, life and life!

All promises, it's over
The fire that burned, turned off
The kisses you gave me, I took them

Nothing is, now I come!

I loved you, I cried you! (I cried you) .. Beibii ..
And life I have given you!
You Might Also Like (while you)
And Tuuu, you make fun of Mii! ..
You make me suffer ..
You lie to me

You suffer! How I will see it!
And in your life nobody will keep you!
What you did pay me!
If in my hands I had a dagger I would use it! .. And life would take you
For leaving me so alone and empty!
For my mother that I would drag, life and life!

Those things hurt
How they hurt you
You don't have me anymore
You can not
(no no no no)

Scoundrel!! I gave you all my life!
I breathed for you!
And now you run out of me!
Beibiii

You don't know what to be loved
(You don't know Naa, you don't know Naa!) Beibii
And now you are desperate
(Give paa!)

And Yoooo
I sing this song
I am getting excited
And tube confusion, disappointment!

While Tuu
You suffer! How I will see it! (vamo to kill)
And in your life nobody will keep you! (EEH)
What you did pay me!
If in my hands I had a dagger I would use it! .. And life would take you
For leaving me so alone and empty!
For my mother that I would drag, life and life!
