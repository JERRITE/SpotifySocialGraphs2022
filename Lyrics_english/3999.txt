Tell me if you will return Lyrics [lyrics of "Tell me if you will return"]

[Enter: Ezvit 810]
I hope to tell you what I feel, but I feel that I will never be able
Tell me what the hell is it to think if you while you are with him
This is a "I want and I can't" and I look at the sky and I see a paper plane
With a letter that bears your name, I read it and say that you will not return

[Chorus: Luani]
I am nothing and with you without you and I had everything
I know it 'lo' two
I don't forget your face, I 'remember' I don't delete it
I don't forget your voice
[Verse 1: Ezvit 810]
I don't delete your voice from my mind
Maybe I wasn't enough
Maybe very demanding
And p–µdias things that could not offer you
You tried it and you changed my luck
We are the envy of all people
Or maybe we never went

[Saying: Luani, Luani & Ezvit 810]
And tell me if you will return
Is that I am depressed to know that you are no longer
Time does not heals me and they can happen
Days, weeks, months, I'm not going to forget you
And tell me if you will return
Is that I am depressed to know that you are no longer
Time does not heals me and they can happen
Days, weeks, months, I'm not going to forget you

[Verse 2: Ezvit 810 & Luani]
Girl, I've changed, I'm not before
I know I left and I will call you a long time
Before a smile I wanted to get you
Now I think about hanging on that swing in the park
Do not let it jump, even late (hey)
It gives me too much courage to see an outcome in just a message

And everything we were, what we wanted
Together we get a forbidden love
And I only ask you what we have lived
Do not fall into oblivion, no, uh, Yeh

[Verse 4: Ezvit 810]
I still think everything we did, everything we were together
All the false promises we never fulfill, but we promised
We avoid, but we smile
We try and we don't get it
Now we cry for losing
And that together we form, we have destroyed it

[Chorus: Luani]
I am nothing and with you without you and I had everything
I know it 'lo' two
I don't forget your face, I 'remember' I don't delete it
I don't forget your voice

[Saying: Ezvit 810 & Luani]
And tell me if you will return
Is that I am depressed to know that you are no longer
Time does not heals me and they can happen
Days, weeks, months, I'm not going to forget you
And tell me if you will return
Is that I am depressed to know that you are no longer
Time does not heals me and they can happen
Days, weeks, months, I'm not going to forget you
[Verse 5: Ezvit 810]
I can't forget you, your wet kisses for me were art
I want to ask you to give me your hand and we commit ourselves as before
I want to take you to Mars and tell you that you are my world and you will always be
And you will always be my treasure, I swear for everything that I will never stop loving you
And jump from the past and live the present
I'm going to wait by my side
Walking just to see you and tell you that I love you
I want to feel love again
And I promise you that I'm going to give everything
For being able to be what we were
Think only one second time
