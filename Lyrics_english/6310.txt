Gladiator Lyrics [lyrics for "Gladiator"]

[Part 1: Asche]
Hyped like Koba Lad, in the Nike Jogger, Overdressed
Asche's upper body you don't get from donutsnacks
Hold the Yeezys Clean like deduction of the Tokarew
Ashkobar is now everyone's lips like coronates tests
Shoot on you rat child
Max Payne, thirty years ashes is my marketing
For your sexy sister sharper than a carpet knife
I have the aura of Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti western
Best villain like Heath Ledger
Sit 'with Muslim in a seven and shoot' rapper
Get out at the traffic lights, I don't need a reason to go
Bum-Bum-Ciao goes and the mouth protection flies out
Everyone just smiled at me in the scene
But Colle believed in me, today I save the scene
Ash hype, stocks rise, tell your stock exchange broker
The new universal soldier
[Hook: ashes & Kollegah]
I am and will remain a gladiator (wuah)
Having bare hands on marble (wuah)
I prefer to pull the night before the day (wuah)
And go out on each of you, like Russell Crowe
Because I am and will remain a gladiator (wuah)
Having bare hands on marble (wuah)
I prefer to pull the night before the day (wuah)
And go out on each of you, like Russell Crowe

[Part 2: Kollegah]
Yeah, outside the fighting dog barks on the wooden fence
Snow trickles down like in the hourglass of the gold dust
The boss is back on melancholic string beats
Tailored to your body like a nobles designerpiece
Yeah, poetic street rap
My sound has always had something Beethoven -like
Something melodramatic, because it took the fame
I was oversight, like Jesus von Nazaret
Despite the phenomenal swag, heartless world
They warn you of mistakes, but you have to learn yourself
I learned to read faces as if it were WhatsApp emojis
And from fabric routes, homie, I was a head calculating professional
Yeah, I'll come with the Chechen (EY)
And let you step away (ey) as if I were sergeant (ey)
On the street like the Royce-Spur'n (the boss)
He stays over water like a lighthouse (because)
You Might So Like [Hook: Asche & Kollegah]
I am and will remain a gladiator (wuah)
Having bare hands on marble (wuah)
I prefer to pull the night before the day (wuah)
And go out on each of you, like Russell Crowe
Because I am and will remain a gladiator (wuah)
Having bare hands on marble (wuah)
I prefer to pull the night before the day (wuah)
And go out on each of you, like Russell Crowe

[Outro: ash]
I am and will remain a gladiator
Having bare hands on marble
I prefer to pull the night ahead of the day
And go out on each of you, like Russell Crowe
Because I am and will remain a gladiator (gladiator)
Having bare hands on marble (marble)
I prefer to pull the night before (day before)
And go out on each of you like Russell Crowe1embed
