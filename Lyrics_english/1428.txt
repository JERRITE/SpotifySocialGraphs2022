Never Be Us Lyrics[Intro]
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be, never be, never be

[Verse 1]
I know I shouldn't think this way about you
But you got something
It's like the world stops when I'm around you
I'ma tell you one thing
That I don't wanna put no pressure on you
But I wanna take you home
[Pre-Chorus]
I know we talk too much
And we shouldn't but we know we want to
Electric when we touch
And I know you feel it too

[Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout waking up next to you
I've been thinking 'bout, nah, nah, that could never be us
I've been thinking 'bout waking up next to you
I've been thinking 'bout, nah, nah, that could never be us
I'm waking up, waking up, waking up thinking 'bout you
Waking up, waking up, waking up, nah, nah, that could never be us

[Post-Chorus]
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
I'm waking up, waking up, waking up thinking 'bout you
Waking up, waking up, waking up, nah, nah, that could never be us

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna be the one to make the first move
'Cause that's my motive
Am I being too obvious around you
Wonder if they've noticed
That I don't wanna give the wrong impression
But I wanna take you home

I know we talk too much
And we shouldn't but we know we want to
Electric when we touch
And I know you feel it too

[Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout waking up next to you
I've been thinking 'bout, nah, nah, that could never be us
I've been thinking 'bout waking up next to you
I've been thinking 'bout, nah, nah, that could never be us
I'm waking up, waking up, waking up thinking 'bout you
Waking up, waking up, waking up, nah, nah, that could never be us

[Post-Chorus]
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be us

Nah, nah, that could never be us
Nah, nah, that could never be usEmbed
