[Enter: J Balvin & Farruko]
Hey Rvssian! (NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA)
J Balvin, man (hahahaha)

[Pre-car: J Balvin & Farruko]
This is no accident
When you see what is behind
If when the DJ is motivated with the bass
You never want to stop (PU-PU-PU-PUM!)
Farru '!
[Chorus: Farruko & J Balvin]

[Verse 1: Farruko]
Am√°rre yourself the belts that we are going to take off
The atmosphere is good and the music for dancing
She says she is shy and I want to check it (Wuh!)
If you do not release the good, the bad one will let go
Put the neurons rub but don't go in a coma (Wuh!)
With the note I have, I feel that I am a rubber
Dancing I am well loose, my mind is no longer reasoning
And if it gets fresh, right here (eh-oh, prr!)

[Pre-car: Farruko]
This is danced well, chilling with the note (the note)
Relax, get your

[Chorus: Farruko & J Balvin]
Put it (put)
Reggaeton pa 'dancing (what dance)
Pa 'that is released (release)
The music does not change it (don't change it)
Put (put), reggaeton pa 'what dance (what dance)
Pa 'that is released (release)
The music does not change it (Yeah Yeah)

The owner of the recipe arrived (Wuh!)
Puts you reggaeton and you break that diet
There are no prohibitions, she is open -minded (she knows)
I don't want a portion, I love you complete (Yeah, Yeah)
You are night and day (day)
Independent, does not need a company (company)
She is decent, but only in the day (in the day)
Because the night calms the desire he had; Leggo)

[Pre-car: J Balvin]
This is no coincidence (chance)
When you see what is behind (what's behind)
If when the DJ is motivated with the low you never want to stop (you never want to stop)
