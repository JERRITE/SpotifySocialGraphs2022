Midnight Thoughts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am, 12 AM, sunk in deep to my bed
Kept alive by the light of the moon
Close my eyes, but my mind got its own plan tonight
And it keeps rubbing salt in the wound

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's too late as night turns to day
Now there's no escaping the ghosts

[Chorus]
I can't shake these midnight thoughts when I'm alone
Latching to my brain and never letting go
So I start making friends with the noise in my head
And all these midnight thoughts when I'm alone
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Dim the lights, shut the blinds, but I'm counting the time
Am I nervous or am I insane?
Try to turn up the sound, but I can't shut it out
'Cause I'm hearing the pulse in my veins

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's too late as night turns to day
Now there's no escaping the ghosts

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't shake these midnight thoughts when I'm alone
Latching to my brain and never letting go
So I start making friends with the noise in my head
And all these midnight thoughts when I'm alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
('Cause I can't shake these midnight thoughts when I'm alone)

[Bridge]
I know it's too late as night turns to day
Now there's no escaping the ghosts
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I can't shake these midnight thoughts when I'm alone
Latching to my brain and never letting go, no (Never letting go)
So I start making friends with the noise in my head
And all these midnight thoughts when I'm alone
(Midnight thoughts when I'm alone)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
So I start making friends with the noise in my head
And all these midnight thoughts when I'm alone (With these thoughts)
With all these midnight thoughts when I'm alone4Embed
