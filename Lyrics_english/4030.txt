The Lyrics treatment [text of "La Cura"]

[Verse 1]
I will protect you from the fears of the hypochondria
From the disturbances that you will meet today for your way
From the injustices and the deceptions of your time
From the failures that you will normally attract by your nature

[Refrain 1]
I will lift you from the pains and your mood overhangs
From the obsessions of your manias
I will exceed gravitational currents
Space and light so as not to get older
And you will heal from all diseases
Because you are a special being
And I, I will take care of you
[Bridge]
I wandered for the Tennessee camps
As I got there, who knows
Don't you have white flowers for me?
Fast of eagles my dreams
They cross the sea

[Verse 2]
I will mainly bring you silence and patience
We will travel together the ways that lead to the essence
The perfumes of love will inexibriate our bodies
The August bonaccia will not calm our senses

[Refrain 2]
I will weave your hair as a singing plots
I know the laws of the world and I will give you it
I will exceed gravitational currents
Space and light so as not to get older
I will save you from all melancholy
Because you are a special being
And I, I will take care of you
I yes, which I will take care of Teyou Might Also Like2embed
