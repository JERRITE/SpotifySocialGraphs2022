Poor Isaac Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh and God just leave that Abraham alone
He wants a son, he wants a son
Everybody wants a home

Though I'm not quite sure if poor Isaac would agree
"My God," he said, "What did I do
To make you wanna watch me bleed?"
And I feel sick tonight, I feel just like
The dancing flame on a funeral light
And I'm not sure if I want you to save me
And I'd be less uptight if I knew the sight
Of blood was just a weakness
And not the whole reason that you made me
But sometimes I think it is...

[Chorus]
Oh and God just go and leave me all alone
I'm not your son, I'm not your son
Everybody dies alone

Was this world not quite hard enough for you?
I guess like anyone, you've got
Your own scores to settle too
And I'm so pissed tonight, I feel just like
The last remainin' Canaanite
And I don't think that I will be returning
And if you wanna see the irony
And the savage price of piety
There’s a lot of us who are going to be burning
How does it feel?

[BRIDGE]
And the sorrow that I know
When I’m alone, I can’t express
All these darling angels singing in my ear
And the comfort of their touch
It cuts right through this emptiness
And it’s everything I want and everything I fear
You might also likeBut I don’t fear God

That child was my friend
I spent a long time with his curse
I can feel him trembling beneath his plea
I don’t know if there is water
All I know is there’s this thirst
And it might be for the best
Though I’m not quite sure if Isaac would agreeEmbed
