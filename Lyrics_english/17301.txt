45 South Lyrics[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Tunnel vision
Ain’t seein' shit but the mission
Stuck off in a system that want you dead or in prison
Gotta risk a life just in order to make a livin’
Hope you know that with them sharks is where you’re swimmin’
And I’m just sittin’ back
Just peepin’ and shit
I got sick and talkin' ‘bout it
Started bein' the shit
And now they eyes opened up and started seein' the shit
Them niggas in the barbershop all agree with this shit
That’s hard work
I put it in and it’s payin' off
Them fresh white, gold frame, and some new Lacoste
I know the flow’s too hard, but that leather’s soft
I hit the wax so smooth, barely ever cough
I give a fuck how you feelin'
Didn’t want your opinion
You wasn’t down in the beginnin’
Don’t come around when we’re winnin’
I’m gettin’ down in the kitchen
It’s a five star dish
Puttin’ food on the plate
Call him Mr. Steak & Shrimp, punk bitch, uh
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ain’t fuckin’ with niggas
I’m on some other shit
Did laps around niggas that I was runnin’ with
At first I was dreamin’ about a mothership
And now I’m tryin’ to buy my mother’s crib, no lie
I’m well aware of these snakes in the grass, I see ‘em all
Pretend to be your partner, but pray you possibly fall
Wanted me a million, but I was thinkin' too small
I thought they showed me love
I wasn’t thinkin' at all
That’s what it is though
Best to let ‘em rush and play they hand
Falling off isn’t some shit I understand
Built it up on my own
Fuck workin’ for the man
And I show love back for everyone who needs a hand
Cause I ain’t got fans mothafuckers, just fam
If I fell from the sky, on my feet is where I land
Took it from the Norf side, all the way to Japan
Wakin’ up, goin’ hard
Gotta execute the plan, god damn nigga

[Chorus]

Ain’t fuckin’ with niggas
I’m on some other shit
Did laps around niggas that I was runnin’ with
Did laps around niggas that I was runnin’ with, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
