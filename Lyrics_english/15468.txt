My Lyrics Independence Day [lyrics by "My Independence Day"]

[Introduction]
Shh! Listen
These are the voices of species in state of extinction
Fight, for them and for you
Make this day your independence day

[Verse 1]
You wear so quirky
Why don't you fix your room?
I do not like tattoos
Of the guy with whom you go out
That aree in the navel
That kind of friends
Care and you walk in drugs
It would be our dishonor
[Bridge]
How wrong they are
I'm not like them think

[Verse 2]
He is the man with his rules
While killing whales
While all over the planet
He makes war
But one day I will be fed up
The wings are going to grow
And I'll go out the window
Or by the door and it will be

[Chorus]
It will be, it will be, it will be, it will be, it will be
My Independence Day
It will be, it will be, it will be, it will be, it will be
My Independence Day
Ah, ah, ah!

[Verse 3]
You better tell me
If you are still virgin
I wouldn't forgive you
What your aunts would say
You have no voice or vote
Until you turn eighteen
And you shut up and obey
Because that's how it seems to me
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
How wrong they are
I'm not like them think

[Rep. Verse 2]
He is the man with his rules
While killing whales
While all over the planet
He makes war
But one day I will be fed up
The wings are going to grow
And I'll go out the window
Or by the door and it will be

[Chorus]
It will be, it will be, it will be, it will be, it will be
My Independence Day
It will be, it will be, it will be, it will be, it will be
My Independence Day
Ah, ah, ah! Embed
