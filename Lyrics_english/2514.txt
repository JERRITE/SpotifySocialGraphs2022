Best Damn Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Would you tell me what you're thinking?
'Cause you really not saying much of anything
On and on we play this game, and
I'm just tryna make you happy
And I'm tired of second-guessing everything we are
Hanging by a thread, and I'm just

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in emotion, got me overdosing
I can't tell if you still feel the same
We're not the way we once were
Tell me is this over
I gotta know
[Chorus]
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
You're the best damn thing that I've ever had
And I don't know what I'd do if I'd ever lose you
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
But I can't do much if you're over it
So tell me what to do
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna tell you what I'm thinking
'Cause I want you to know just where I'm coming from
On and on we stay the same, when
We're not saying what we're feeling
Gotta fix all of the demons that are haunting us
Tell me is this not what you want?

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in emotion, got me overdosing
I can't tell if you still feel the same
We're not the way we once were
Tell me is this over
I gotta know
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
You're the best damn thing that I've ever had
And I don't know what I'd do if I'd ever lose you
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
But I can't do much if you're over it
So tell me what to do
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had

[Bridge]
So you can take it, or you can leave it
'Cause I can't do this anymore, ooo-whoa, hey
So if you want it, then you can have it
Maybe we could have it all, ooh, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
You're the best damn thing that I've ever had
And I don't know what I'd do if I'd ever lose you
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
But I can't do much if you're over it
So tell me what to do
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
You're the best damn thing that I've ever had
And I don't know what I'd do if I'd ever lose you
'Cause you're the best damn thing that I've ever had
But I can't do much if you're over it
So tell me what to do (Tell me what to do)
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause I want to be the best damn thing that you've had too2Embed
