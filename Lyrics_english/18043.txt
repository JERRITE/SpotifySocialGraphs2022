Means Something Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something

[Verse 2]
I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leos get along great
And that has to mean something

[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something
[Break]
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something

[Verse 4]
I felt the way that you kissed me
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something (Something, something)

[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

[Bridge]
Every time I think too much
It ends up crazy
I don't know how to not think about you
Every time I trust my gut
I think I'm crazy
'Cause I don't know how to put my trust in you
You might also like[Outro]
Do you think it means something
That I wrote another song about you?Embed
