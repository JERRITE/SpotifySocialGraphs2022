April afternoon Lyrics ["April afternoon"]

[Verse 1]
Tired of losing you
Thinking only about what could be
Trying to look for you
Without being able to find you
There is nothing to do

[Pre-car]
And to think that you are no longer here makes me feel what some you see lived in an afternoon April when I received
[Chorus]
A letter of a thousand colors full of hearts
And while I read it, I realized that it was not mine
It started with greetings ended only your name
There was no time for a I love you
You got my illusions

[Verse 2]
Tired of looking at you and unable to kiss you
I do not want to see you anymore
I ask you to go away if necessary
But not come back

[Pre-car]
And to think that you are no longer here makes me feel what some you see lived in an afternoon April when I received

[Chorus]
A letter of a thousand colors full of hearts
And while I read it, I realized that it was not mine
It started with greetings ended only your name
There was no time for a I love you
You got my illusions

[Bridge]
You played with my love
As if it were a paper doll
Without understanding that

[Outro]
Looking at you to walk away from this place makes me feel that you will not return
Know that you are no longer making me sigh
And I wonder what opens a bad fact
Looking at you to walk away from this place makes me feel that you will not return
Know that you are no longer making me sigh
And I wonder what opens a bad fact
Looking at you to walk away from this place makes me feel that you don't come back
