Yesterday my former lyrics called me [letter from "yesterday my ex" ft called me. Lenny Santos]

[Intro: khea]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Khea Young Flex in the Game
Yeah
Yesterday he threw a flame'o and I was smoke
Yesterday I threw a flame'o and I was—

[Chorus: khea]
Yesterday my ex called me and told me that the boyfriend he has now is boring
You can't feel what I felt with me
And I get the hard one, but for nothing I forget it
Such a ass on eBay I don't get it
We went wrong but also good
Made it come every two for three
We fought and fixed with sex (oh!)
Yesterday my ex called me and told me that the boyfriend he has now is boring (Yeah-eh)
That you can't feel what I felt with me (Yeah-eh)
And I get the hard one, but for nothing I forget it (Yeah-eh)
Such a ass on eBay I don't get it (UH-UH)
We went wrong but also good (too)
He made her come every two for three (three)
We fought and fixed with six
[Verse 1: khea]
I have the 'video' (yoh), that 'that recorded' (yes, yes)
I almost didn't think how good it was about it '(Puh)
When Acapella did it 'in the bathroom (ey)
The candle blew, to 'the day' was my birthday '(ey)
And now that it is not 'together' something I find it strange (strange)
Without you I am better, I do not vo'a to put deception '(no)
And I can't deny that your sex strange it (ey)
But your love hurt me (yes, yes, yes)
Ta-ta-ta (yeah), ra-ta-ta (yeah)
I was going to your home and you were not (MHM)
As much as it was bad, with the good I had
They are countless times that forgave you
Your mother called me because I was' depressed (-Frift)
I didn't know 'why, but I did know (Baby)
The only one who could heal the wound (the wound)
Baby, I know it, you know it 'still (prr, prr), Yeah

[Pre-stribe: khea]
Yeah, EH-EH-EH (WAIT, EY)
And now he calls me to give him (wait, hey)
Yeah, EH-EH-EH (WAIT, EY; NO, NO)
He wants to be my wife (Wait, Ey)
Yeah, EH-EH-EH (WAIT, EY; NO, NO)
And now he calls me to give him (wait, hey)
Yeah, EH-EH-EH (WAIT, EY)
He wants to return— (Oh!)
