â€‹goosebumps (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Mitchel Cave & Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Offered her a pill and now she all in (Ooh)
Took her from the Hills, now we rollin'
Probably get her killed by the morning, yeah
Pedal to the motherfuckin' floor, man
Full acceleration, hear me roarin', ah
Call the record label, why they stalling? (Yeah)
I don't think they understand importance (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Poppin' a pill with my left hand
Got my right hand on your girly (Woo)
She rollin' off to the side, side, side
Why she up so fucking early? (Yeah)
I would fuck her, but it's early (Yeah)
Pop another, now it's hurting (Woo)
Sipping, driving got me swerving (Woo)
Book a table, I'm reserving

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]
Now this feeling like a circus
Half the shit in here was worthless (Yeah)
Got you so, so deep in your feelings
Wondering if you've got a purpose (Sheesh)
Grab your friends and tell 'em work it (Woo)
Everybody looking nervous (Yeah)
You coming, coming to wreak havoc
I'll be sliding through, yeah, it's certain (Yeah)
I just caught a motherfucking vibe (Caught a vibe), woo
Tell that bitch you motherfuckin' right, oh, oh, oh (Fuckin' right)
I've been doing whatever I like, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
You know I get those goosebumps every time, yeah (Yeah)
Probably get her killed by the morning, yeah

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
You come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every timeYou might also like4Embed
