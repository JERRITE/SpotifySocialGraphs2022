THE LYRICS PROBLEM [CHORUS]
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me

[Verse 1]
Some time ago I have lost my reason
And although I am looking for an explanation
To what is happening to me that it is precipitating me
That asks me for a solution
[Pre-car]
And every time I feel it I analyze it and I think about it
I always look for an explanation
I look and look for and I don't find her and everything that I carry inside
Becomes great confusion

[Chorus]
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me

[Verse 2]
Some say this is an obsession
But others say it is something much worse
It is a spell that has caused me a problem

[Pre-car]
And every time I analyze it and think about it
And I always look for an explanation
I look and look for and I don't find her and everything that I carry inside
Becomes great confusion

[Bridge]
Is that I want me to love me that I want to love
You have to love me like that I don't want to love
The one I don't want to want to see her suffer anymore
And the one I want me to want to be able to fall in love

Is that I want me to love me that I want to love
That loves me like that I don't want to love
The one I don't want to want to see her suffer more
And the one I want me to want to be able to fall in love

[Chorus]
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me
What serves me, what loves me
That person I don't want to love me
If the one I want to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me

Oh loves me how I want me to love me
He doesn't love me how I want me to love me1embed
