If I didn't like Lyrics [letter from "if I didn't want you"]

[See 1: Juan Magan]
Maxi is so pretty
She is so pretty
Has a princess face
My pump of flesh and bone
Melts when giving him a kiss

Intelligent
Do not believe in boys
She is brave
I don't know if I explain myself
Independent
What a pleasure to have you
In front of my pa 'that people see
That I love you and I have you in my mind
[Chorus]
Oh, ay, ay, ay
If I didn't want you
How could I sing?
Everything I feel
Everything you give me
It is something that I express with my ay, ay, ay

And I return ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
If I didn't want you
How could I sing?
Everything I feel
Everything you give me
It is something that I express with my ay, ay, ay

(Belinda)

You make me Feel So Alive
When i'm with you i touch the sky
I'm so in love it ain't no lie
You are the only one for me

You ere 'the one who gives me my candle
The one who puts me to enjoy
The one who sets me to 'La' Luce '
When I have it turns off '
The one who has my heart
I fell in love with this song
Only you Baby Just You

And oh, and ay, and ay, and ay
You make me 'crazy
You know what there is
I'm so in love it ain't no lie
'Cause Your The Only One for Me

Oh, ay, ay, eat on

It is something that I express with my ay, ay, ay

Let's go
You have magic, wisdom
You have the practice and theory
I am so yours
You are so mine
I want to love you without hypocrisy

Take you to a world you didn't know
Give you my love at night and for the day
I want to take you to the movies, give you ice cream
I want to get old, but by your side
[Chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
If I didn't want you
How could I sing?
Everything I feel
Everything you give me
It is something that I express with my ay, ay, ay

And I return ay, ay, ay, ay
If I didn't want you
How could I sing?
Everything I feel
Everything you give me
It is something that I express with my ay, ay, ay
