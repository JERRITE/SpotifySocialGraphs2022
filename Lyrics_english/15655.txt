[Verse 1]
tell me where he is from
Finally, I will know where I am going
Mom says when looking good
We always end up finding
She says he is never very far away
That he very often leaves to work
Mom says "working is good"
Much better than being badly accompanied
Not true ?
[Bridge]
Where is your dad ?
Tell me where your Dad is ?
Without even talking to him
He knows what's wrong
Ah Sacred Dad
Tell me where are you hiding ?
It must, do at least a thousand times that I have
Count my fingers
Hey!

[Chorus]
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you
Where are you...

[Verse 2]
What, we believe it or not
There will be a day when we will no longer believe it
One day or another we will all be daddy
And from one day to the other we will have disappeared
Will we be hated ?
Will we be admirable?
Broodstock or geniuses ?
Tell us who gives birth to the irresponsible?
Ah tell us who, hold
Everyone knows how we make babies
But nobody knows how we do dads
Sir I have inherited it, that's it
Should it suck it with your thumb or what?
Tell us where it is hidden, it must
Do at least a thousand times that we have
Puff our fingers
Hey!

Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you
Where are you...

[Bridge]
Where is your dad ?
Tell me where your Dad is ?
Without even talking to him
He knows what's wrong
Ah Sacred Dad
Tell me where are you hiding ?
It must, do at least a thousand times that I have
Count my fingers
Hey
Where is your dad ?
Tell me where your Dad is ?
Without even talking to him
He knows what's wrong
Ah Sacred Dad
Tell me where are you hiding ?
It must, do at least a thousand times that I have
Count my fingers
Hey!
[Chorus]
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you? Papaoutai ?
Where are you, where are you, papaoutai?
Where are you
Where you're ... 195embed
