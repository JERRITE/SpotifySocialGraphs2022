[Verse 1]
You and me
Could be enough
We'll ride the storm
When the skies get rough
I will stay
Through cold and dark
I'll take your hand
And I'll pick you up
[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) Til the worlds run dry
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) Never question why
(Hey-yeah) No hesitation
(Ayo-eh-eh) I'll be on your side
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) It's you and I (It's you and I)

[Verse 2]
We have no need
For the light of day
While the world's asleep
We'll be miles away
To innocence
Through right or wrong
You take my hand and
You lead me on

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) Til the worlds run dry
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) Never question why
(Hey-yeah) No hesitation
(Ayo-eh-eh) I'll be on your side
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) It's you and I (It's you and I)

(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) Til the worlds run dry
(Oh-oh) And I give you love
(Ayo-eh-eh) It's you and I1Embed
