Mouthful of Cavities Lyrics(Listen man I got the window open, hear the cats? Listen)

[Verse 1]
Mouthful of cavities
And your soul's a bowl of jokes
And everyday you remind me
How I'm desperately in need
See, I got a lot of fiends around
And they're peeking through and nothing new
And they see you, they see everything you do
(Everything you do)
[Chorus]
Seein' everything on the inside out

[Verse 2]
Oh, please give me a little more
And I'll push away those baby blues
'Cause, one of these days, this will die
So will me, and so will you
I write a letter to a friend of mine
And tell him how much I used to love to watch him smile
See, I haven't seen him smile in a little while
Haven't seen him smile in a little while

[Chorus]
But I know you're laughing from the inside, out
Laughing from the inside, out
I know you're laughing on the inside, out
Laughing from the inside, the inside, the inside, outYou might also like2Embed
