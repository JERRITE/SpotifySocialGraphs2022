Temporary Bliss Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come over, quarter past two
Love in my eyes, blinded by you
Just to get a taste of heaven
I'm on my knees

[Verse 2]
I can't help it, I'm addicted
But I can't stand the pain inflicted
In the morning, you're not holding
Onto me
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, what's the point of doing this every night?
What you're giving me is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby, make up your mind

[Chorus]
Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

[Verse 3]
We were on fire, now we're frozen
There's no desire, nothing spoken
You're just playing, I keep waiting for your heart
(I keep waiting for you)

[Verse 4]
I am fiending for the sunshine
To show our love in a good light
Give me reason, I am pleading
To the stars
(Tell me)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, what's the point of doing this every night?
What you're giving me is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby, make up your mind

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

[Bridge]
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Na na na na, na na na na

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby, why're you calling me?
Not another one night, trying to be your whole life
I don't want to fall asleep

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss
[Chorus 2]
I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
I can't keep feeling love like this
It's not worth temporary bliss8Embed
