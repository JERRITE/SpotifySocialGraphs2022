If you remember my lyrics (magnate)
And we got lost in the air, as if nothing happened
It was like a past water
You tell me

(Valentino)
As love was lost, there is no count of the roses
That if you love me or boots
You tell me

(Magnate)
And I went a lifetime, my breath goes and you don't breathe
That was that I lost, and I did not understand
That I have a great love
And so
(Magnate)
There are, if you remember me
It has been so long for so long
That even maybe I remember you
That's why

(Magnate)
There are, and you forget me, and that's why memories
Shot to the wind, take the time
Already forget you, already forget you
Ehhhh

(Valentino)
An angel would have to come, who with his wings was covered
The little pieces were, of that love
And you with my photo in your bed, you thought I didn't know
All the secret you saved
Tell me

(Magnate)
And I went a lifetime, my breath goes and you don't breathe
That was that I lost, and I did not understand
That I have a great love
And so

(Magnate)
There are, if you remember me
It has been so long for so long
That even maybe I remember you
That's why
You Might Also Like (Magnate)
There are, and you forget me, and that's why memories
Shot to the wind, take the time
Already forget you, already forget you
Ehhhh

(Valentino)
It has been so long
That love left
And I didn't know that so little time lasted
In the air with the fire I burn

(Valentino)
They say that the wound of a love leaves
But mine, because this is still
That 20 years are nothing is not true
There is no more and more cure

(Magnate)
There are, if you remember me
It has been so long for so long
That even maybe I remember you
That's why

(Magnate)
There are, and you forget me, and that's why memories
Shot to the wind, take the time
I already forget you, already forget you
