Whorey Heart Lyrics[Chorus]
You say you wanna love me but you can't control your whorey heart
You got a disorder that provokes you from the bottom part
You don’t want, you don't want walks in the park
You just want everyone sucking you off
You got a, you got a whorey heart
And you don't know how to just stop it at one

[Refrain]
You say you, say you wanna love me
But you can’t control your whorey heart
You say you, say you only want me
But your appetite forever starves
[Verse 1]
But I...
Kinda wanna see if the D is worth the lesson
Should I...
Be another speck in your pum pum collection?
If I...
Take it down, lay it down, go all in
Will I act appalled when you're fucking my best friend?
Yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Always wanna hit me on a late night text
Then you wanna scoop me on a late night flex
All the bitches know you, they say "that's my ex"
You're the type of nigga that don't wear latex
Gross

[Chorus]
You say you wanna love me, but you can't control your whorey heart
You got a disorder that provokes you from the bottom part
You don't want, you don't want walks in the park
You just want everyone sucking you off
You got a, you got a whorey heart
And you don’t know how to just stop it at one

[Refrain]
You say you, say you wanna love me
But you can’t control your whorey heart
You say you, say you only want me
But your appetite forever starves
You might also like[Verse 2]
But I...
Put in the address just to see the directions
Should I...
Pull up in a trench and finesse this attraction?
If I...
Hit reply, sister wife with all them
Will I...
Feel some type when you don't use protection?
Yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Kinda wanna sit down pon it, no regrets
Kinda wanna call you out on all your shit
All the bitches know you, they say "that’s my ex"
You're the type of nigga that don't wear latex
Gross

[Chorus]
You say you wanna love me, but you can't control your whorey heart
You got a disorder that provokes you from the bottom part
You don’t want, you don't want walks in the park
You just want everyone sucking you off
You got a, you got a whorey heart
And you don't know how to just stop it at one
[Refrain]
You say you, say you wanna love me
But you can't control your whorey heart
You say you, say you only want me
But your appetite forever starves

[Chorus]
Ahhh...
You say you wanna love me, but you can't control your whorey heart
You got a disorder that provokes you from the bottom part
You don't want, you don't want walks in the park
You just want everyone sucking you off
You got a, you got a whorey heart
And you don't want-
Ahhh...
Fuck are the words?Embed
