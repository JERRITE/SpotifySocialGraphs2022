Hanging in your hands (with Marta Sánchez) Lyricsletra of "hanging in your hands" ft. Marta Sánchezquizá was not coincidence to find me with you
Maybe this was done by fate
I want to fall asleep in your chest
And then they wake up your kisses
Your sixth meaning dreams of me
I know we will be united soon
That naughty smile that lives with me
I know I will be on your way soon
You know I'm hanging on your hands
So don't drop me
You know I'm hanging on your hands
[Chorus]
I send you poems of my handwriting
I send you 4.40 songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so you remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands
Careful, careful
That my heart is hanging in your hands

I will not lose hope to talk to you
I do not care what destiny says
I want to have your fragrance with me
And drink from you the forbidden
You know I'm hanging on your hands
So don't drop me
You know I'm hanging on your hands

[Chorus]
I send you poems of my fist and lyrics
I send you 4.40 songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so, you remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands
Be careful (very careful)
Cuado, Marta I tell you
You have me in your hands
It doesn't matter what destiny says
Stay with me
I want everything from you
Your lips your love forbidden

[Chorus]
I send you poems of my handwriting
I send you 4.40 songs
I send you the photos dinner in Marbella
And when we were for Venezuela
And so you remember and keep in mind
That my heart is hanging in your hands

Careful, careful
That my heart is hanging in your hands
That my heart is hanging in your hands
That my heart is hanging in your handsyou might Also likembed
