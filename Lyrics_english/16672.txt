Gigolos Get Lonely Too Lyrics[Verse 1:]
I guess you've heard of my reputation, I've had my share of foolin' around
But everybody needs stimulation, and mine just happens to be all over town
It's an easy-money occupation, a first-class psychiatry
But just once, I'd wanna make love without taking off my clothes
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows:

[Chorus:]
Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you
[Verse 2:]
Maybe you're the kind of person, that could turn my world around
Won't you gimme little inspiration? Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down
It's an easy-money occupation, but honey one thing understand
I've got more money than you could imagine in your wildest dreams
But honey, money don't make no happy man

[Chorus:]
Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you

[Bridge:]
Just once, I wanna love without takin' off my clothes
Just once, I wanna love with somebody who knows
That I got more money than you could ever see
But honey, money won't get me up off my knees

[Chorus:]
Gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey babe, I think that I need you

[Chorus:]
Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation, but honey babe, I think that I need you
