Bonita Lyrics Song [Lyrics for "Song Pretty"]

[Intro]
With you I feel good, calm and relaxed
I don't need anymore when you're with me
And I'm happy to have you here by my side

[Verse 1]
Excited to make a song that built
That could propose a vision, to fight (auh)
A metaphor, a very hard lyric (hard, how?)
Reflecting politics, culture
But they tell me that criticism does not sell
That most people do not understand
And that they dance only light content
Because the industry only wants light content (say!)
[Pre-car]
That is why in the end
All songs are similar
The market is not going to educate you (no, no, no)
With this choir

[Chorus]
With you I feel good, calm and relaxed
I don't need anymore when you're with me
And I am happy to have you here by my side (as on the beach, Baby)
With you I feel fine
The taste of your kisses melts me
That upload me and get off
And make my whole body stir

[Post-car]
Ohh, Ouhh, Ohh (Ah, but how rich!)
Just a love song
Empty and pretty
Ohh, Ouhh, ohh
Just a love song
Empty and pretty

[Verse 2]
For television a song
You can't talk about the revolution
I don't want to live without you, my heart split myself
Over there, a melody facilitates
A choir that is repeated
FLOW PA 'MOVE THE LEVEL
Reggeton for the belt
That they touch it on the track
And that people sing the part of the OUH-OHH
No one will listen to this letter except for the OUH-OHH
Because your OUH-OHH doesn't care
What I'm telling me ouh-oh
I can tell you that I am allergic to the pistachio
But you will only be the OUH-OHH

That is why in the end
All songs are similar
The market is not going to educate you
With this coâ€”

[Chorus]
With you I feel good, calm and relaxed
I don't need anymore when you're with me
And I'm happy to have you here by my side
With you I feel fine
The taste of your kisses melts me
That upload me and get off
And make my whole body stir

[Post-car]
Ohh, Ouhh, ohh
Just a love song (plastic!)
Empty and pretty (how much slopes?)
Ohh, Ouhh, ohh (and how much are you worth?)
Just a love song
Empty and beautiful (tell me, metals)

[Outro]
(Bacayo Brass)
Only, just a beautiful love song
It is the distracted moral
Tropical amnesia for your life
Only, just a beautiful love song (monkey with a cell phone)
I must, I must leave in two
Only, just a beautiful love song
I must, I must leave in two (Yeaah)
Only, just a beautiful song2embed
