Emotion Sickness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Erupt again, ignore the pill
And I won't let it show
Sacrifice the torture
Orchestral tear cashflow

[Verse 2]
Increase, delete, escape, defeat
It's all that matters to you
Cotton case for an iron pill
[Chorus]
Distorted eyes
When everything is clearly dying

[Post-Chorus]
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and

[Verse 3]
Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroine
Emotion sickness

[Chorus]
Distorted eyes
When everything is clearly dying

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Chorus]
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray

Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Won't you stop my pain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroin
Good things will pass (it helps with excess access)
