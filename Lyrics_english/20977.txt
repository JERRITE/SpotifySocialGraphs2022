Angry Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time, time and again
I've seen you starin' out at me

Now, then and again, I wonder
What it is that you see

[Chorus]
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes...
[Verse 2]
You want to believe
That I am not the same as you
I can't conceive, oh no
What it is you're tryin' to do

[Chorus]
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes
What a shot you could be if
You could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You tried to defend that
You are not the one to blame

But I'm finding it hard, my friend
When I'm in the deadly aim
Of those Angry Eyes

[Chorus]
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes
What a shot you could be
If you could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes
You might also like[Outro]
You have never stopped to realize
Blindness binds us together in the foster skies
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes?Embed
