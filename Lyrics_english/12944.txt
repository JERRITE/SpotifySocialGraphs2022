The Only Place Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if all the worlds in space
Would melt into one single place
And intertwine the human race
With other kinds?
The atom is an empty vase
A vehicle to know embrace
The way you feel, the way you taste
It multiplies

[Pre-Chorus]
So much to share
So much to share
[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

[Verse 2]
What if all the time between
The words we say and what we mean
Would roll as softly as a stream
That we could ride?
We'd ride the bend from source to mouth
I want a friend from north to south
To build that question as a house
Where we'd reside

[Pre-Chorus]
So much to share
So much to share

[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side
You might also like[Break]

[Chorus]
When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your sideEmbed
