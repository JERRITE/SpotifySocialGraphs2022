Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pull the blindfold down
So your eyes can't see
Now run as fast as you can
Through this field of trees

[Verse 2]
Say goodbye to everyone
You have ever known
You are not gonna see them
Ever again
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands say I've been in the wars
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors

[Chorus]
Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?

[Verse 3]
How can we wear our smiles
With our mouths wide shut
Cause you stopped us from singing?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands say I've been in the wars
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors

[Chorus]
Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can I start this again?
You might also likeSomeone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can I start this again?

[Bridge]
We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts left smashed on the floor
I can't believe you if I can't hear you
I can't believe you if I can't hear you
We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor
We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor

[Chorus]
Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can I start this again?Embed
