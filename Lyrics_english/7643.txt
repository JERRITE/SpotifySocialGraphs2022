CANâ€™T TOUCH THIS (R3HAB Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
No stylist, I don't do repeats
I got money, bitch, I'm knee-deep (Cash)
All hunnids, drippin' in CC (Shee)
Might pop that pussy like FreakNik (FreakNik)
No mileage, boy, you can't touch this
No bodies, boy, you ain't fuck shit (You ain't fuck shit)
I'm on islands, whippin' them Porshes
Run shit and your nigga endorse it (Ayy)
No stylist, I don't do repeats (Ayy)
I got money, bitch, I'm knee-deep (Cash)
All hunnids, drippin' in CC (Woo)
Might pop that pussy like FreakNik
[Build]
(Can't touch this)
(You ain't fuck shit)
Ah, can't touch this (Uh)

[Drop]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard (Uh)

[Chorus]
No stylist, I don't do repeats
I got money, bitch, I'm knee-deep (Cash)
All hunnids, drippin' in CC (Shee)
Might pop that pussy like FreakNik (FreakNik)
No mileage, boy, you can't touch this
No bodies, boy, you ain't fuck shit (You ain't fuck shit)
I'm on islands, whippin' them Porshes
Run shit, and your nigga endorse it (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard (Uh)
In the foreign cars (Skrrt)
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
Spendin' his money, so I make a little more (Cash)
I can tell by your dress, we ain't at the same stores
It's a button you press to lift up the door
Tints on fire, so you know I'm a whore (Oh)
Icy, big purr, Pooh Shiesty
Gucci bags don't excite me (Excite me)
Only broke bitches don't like me
Got no time to waste 'cause it's pricey (Cash)
You might also like[Build]
Pricey (Cash), pricey (Cash), pricey (Cash), pricey
Ah, can't touch this (Uh)

[Drop]
Cash
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard (Uh)
(Shee) Ah, can't touch this (Uh)
Cash
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard (Uh)
