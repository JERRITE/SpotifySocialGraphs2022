The Way We Say Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take this plane, delay it
I was only waiting
For you, you know
For you, you know

I stayed in here for ages
And felt the sunlight fading
On you, you know
On you, you know
[Chorus]
But it's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
It's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye

[Verse 2]
So take this plane, delay it
I heard the music fading
With you, you know
With you
We'll stay outside the cages
And read all the last pages
With you, you know
With you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I miss you
God, I miss you
Love, I miss you
You know I do

[Chorus]
But it's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
It's the way we say goodbye
It kills me now
And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye

Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh
Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh
Ohh, ohh-oh, ohh, ohh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I miss you
God, I miss you
Love, I miss you
You know I do

[Chorus]
And I won't look back in time
'Cause, darling, it's just the way we say goodbye
Just the way we say goodbye
Just the way we say goodbye2Embed
