Another drink Lyrics [letter from "another drink" ft. Darell]

[Enter: Sech & Darell]
Keep here taking another drink
His ex-boyfriend is (ah-ah)
Friends uploaded a state (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
That today from Farra they leave
It changed you even being better than her (no-no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
By women and a couple of bottles (no-no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
For friends who are not friends in Verdá '(in Verdá'; ICE)
Because I know they are going to write to you when he leaves
(Everybody Go To The Disco)
[Pre-Caro: Sech & Darell]
And now to the dark and without dissimulation (that is like that)
Forgetting the 'Pena' I caught her (ah)
Now he does what he wants when he wants (OH-OH)
And if you don't want, you are another who fucks too (here we go again!)

[Chorus: Sech & Darell]
When the DJ puts the music (that is like that)
She dances as never before (pa 'who knows)
And now to the dark (OH-OH), and without dissimulation (OH-OH)
Forgetting the 'Pena' I caught her (ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ puts the music
She dances as never before (The Real Rondón)
Now he does what he wants when he wants
And if you don't want, you are another who fucks too
(Woh, Woh, Stop That Shit, Nigga)
