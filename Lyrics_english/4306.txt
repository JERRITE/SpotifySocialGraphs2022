Bonita Lyrics Carita [Lyrics for "Caita Bonita"]

[Chorus: Nayo & threateazzy]
Your beautiful face makes me bad
Only with a kiss puts me to tremble
I don't know how I could fall in love
But I got used to it and I can't get you out of me
Your beautiful face makes me bad (it makes bad)
I look for you in another body and nobody does it the same (-gual)
I don't know how I could fall in love (falling in love)
But I got used to it and I can't get you
[Verse 1: threat]
I am imprisoned in your jail for my will
And it's your kiss 'what' that move me away from reality
So much temptation, that I no longer manage to escape
I don't want to stay either (Babygyal)
Your part always smells like Chanel (Yah!)
I play it and start Llover (Ualah)
Kill the League, it is at another level (Uff)
From one to die '(skrr), I give him a hundred
I can't fail you, tell me how I forget it
If you already marked me, and the moon witnessed

[Pre-Caro: Menazzy, Nayo & Menazzy]
My baby, me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I became an addict to you (oh, oh)
Now I just think about you (Oh, Oh)
I only live for you (OH-OH-OH, OH)

[Chorus: Nayo & threzzy, both]
Your beautiful face makes me bad (it makes bad)
Only with a kiss puts me to tremble
I don't know how I could fall in love
But I got used to it and I can't get you

[Verse 2: nayo]
I got used to you, now I can't get you
When I drink, I start reminding you
And what I want, ma, e 'undress you
That little body, a work of art
I became an addict of your kiss'
In your skin I live prisoner
I want a Lambo and Par of Millone 'Weight'
But I love you very much more 'that that
You Might Also Like [Pre-Caro: Nayo]
And me, oh
I became an addict to you
Now I just think about you
I only live for you

[Chorus: Nayo & threzzy, both]
Your beautiful face makes me bad (it makes bad)
Only with a kiss puts me to tremble
I don't know how I could fall in love (falling in love)
But I got used to it and I can't get you
Your beautiful face makes me bad (it makes bad)
I look for you in another body and nobody does it the same
I don't know how I could fall in love (falling in love)
But I got used to it and I can't get you
