Night Falls (Dance Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks

[Verse 1]
This could get a little sticky
How to win this battle could be tricky
But I know the best way, fall back, let me lead
You hold the line and we'll bring them to their knees
Swords in the air if you're with me
They got us outnumbered one to fifty
But victory is ours 'cause I got a strategy
You take the left and the rest of you can follow me (Uh-uh)
[Break 1]
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the (Oh my gosh)

[Chorus]
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast
They're too heavy to react

[Verse 2]
This situation's getting kinda heavy
Hold your weapons tight, keep 'em steady
'Cause if we stick together, we can make it out alive
I'll cause a distraction, you attack them from the side
All my soldiers stand at the ready
We can cut 'em up like confetti
We'll hit 'em from the front, you counter from behind
Don't forget the fate of Auradon's on the line
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
This is all-out war, they got us outnumbered
The way the swords clash is the sound of the thunder
This is all-out war, they got us outnumbered
The way the swords clash and ride for each other

[Chorus]
Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done (Oh my...)
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast
They're too heavy to react

[Break 2]
This is my crew
This is my turf
Oh my gosh
This is my crew
This is my turf
We're on the same side
[Verse 3]
Until the night falls, you can trust
I'm gonna help you win this battle because
Suit of armor strong and true
Make this metal bust a move!

[Break 2 (Extended)]
This is my crew (This is my squad)
This is my turf
Oh my gosh
This is my crew (Back to back, back to back)
(Back to back, back to back)
This is my turf (We can counter their attack)
(Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks)
We're on the same side
This is my crew (This is my squad)
This is my turf (It doesn't mean that we're on the same side)                                                                                                                                          (Oh my gosh)
