[Verse 1]
Found someone in my corner, that loves me a lot
And sees the real me, and not just a star
Girl, let's make it known
I'll give you my name and everything that comes with it, yeah
I know you're like a diamond, you're just so flawless
And though you're cautioned, no other options, yeah

Didn't give up on love (Love)
I can't give up on your love (Love)
You can't give up on me, no (No)
