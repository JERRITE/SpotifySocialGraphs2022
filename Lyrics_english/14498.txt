Without wanting to want Lyrics [lyrics by "unintentionally" ft. Mau and Ricky]

[Intro: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
Yes Yes

[Verse 1: lali]
Today I feel more close, maybe
Tonight is more dark
I need a company, truth
And I came to look for you
[Verse 2: Mau and Ricky]
Give him and enjoy, and then ignore me ', come
That you are not signing anything with me
Enjoy, and then ignore me ', come
That you are not signing anything with me

[Pre-car: Lali]
You and me, nobody but you and me
You and me, Nobody But You, Nobody But You

[Chorus: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But-but seemed wanting

[Post-Coro: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
I don't know what happens to me, I don't sleep in another bed
But I saw you very happy with me
I don't know what happens to me, I don't sleep in another bed
But you finished curled up with me

I am very clear what happened yesterday
I was to blame, but you too
But we repeat, but r-, but repeat-
But we repeat to remember what-

[Saying: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
That I was alone and I didn't give you ball
But the lack of control arrived and alcohol passed
He took the clothes
Oh, I was alone and I didn't give you ball
But the lack of control arrived and alcohol passed
He took the clothes

[Bridge: Mau and Ricky]
Give him and enjoy, and then ignore me ', come
That you are not signing anything with me
Enjoy, and then ignore me ', come
That you are not signing anything with me

[Pre-car: Lali]
You and me, nobody but you and me
You and me, Nobody But You, Nobody But You

[Chorus: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But-but seemed wanting
[Post-Coro: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
I don't know what happens to me, I don't sleep in another bed
But I saw you very happy with me
I don't know what happens to me, I don't sleep in another bed
But you finished curled up with me

[Chorus: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But he seemed wanting
Without wanting, unintentionally, yesterday was unintentionally
But-but seemed wanting

[Saying: Lali & Mau and Ricky]
I was alone and I didn't give you ball
But the lack of control arrived and alcohol passed
He took the clothes (Yeah)
Oh, I was alone and I didn't give you ball
But the lack of control arrived and alcohol passed
He took the clothes
