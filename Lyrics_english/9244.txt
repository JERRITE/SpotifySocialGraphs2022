Crazy heat (Goin â€™Crazy) lyricscorring on the tropical road 
 The heat has done me wrong 
 I go crazy but very my way 
 Maybe the sunset reaches me here 

 Well, I want to give up again 
 Devil the devil 
 I no longer complain, I comfort myself 
 You are fringing you because the heat is great 

 I went crazy! Crazy? 
 We dance madly and on the dock last night 
 And I fell into the water - Oh no! 
 The police did not make any funny 
 He said: "Be careful with the mayor's daughter" 

 Don't want me to stop and what can I parrandear 
 I learned very well 
 Deliver to the rhythm, it is difficult to stop 
 You smile because heat is great 

 I went crazy! Crazy? 

 Let's go everyone!!! 
 The heat turned crazy!
