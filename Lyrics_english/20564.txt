Better On My Own Lyrics[Verse]
Feel like shadows on the wall are staring
I can't let these people take control
They can't walk inside the shoes I'm wearing
I feel like I'm better on my own

[Chorus]
Better on my own (My own, my own)
Better on my own (My own, my own)
Oh Lord
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Refrain]
See the reason for me dancing alone is that, uh
I got that groove

[Verse]
Feel like shadows on the wall are staring
I can't let these people take control
They can't walk inside the shoes I'm wearing
I feel like I'm better on my own

[Chorus]
Better on my own (My own, my own)
Better on my own (My own, my own)
Better on my own

[Refrain]
See the reason for me dancing alone is that, eh
I got that groove

[Verse]
Feel like shadows on the wall are staring
I can't let these people take control
They can't walk inside the shoes I'm wearing
I feel like I'm better on my own
You might also like[Chorus]
Better on my own
Better on my own
Better on my own
Better on my own

[Refrain]
See the reason for me dancing alone is that, eh
I got that grooveEmbed
