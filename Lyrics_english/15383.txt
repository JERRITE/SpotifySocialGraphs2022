Inhibition LyricsShown often are
The defences round your heart
Anyone trying to climb
Will fall from high

So you blow off the stars
Cause they won't shine
Quite where you want
Everyone will look at another sky for you

Inhibition
Inhibition
Everyone will still adore you

And you show off your scars
And you describe the size of the shark
Everyone is dying to lend you a hand

Inhibition
We'll help you if we can
Everyone will still adore you

And no one...

Everyone will still adore...
Everyone will still adore...
Everyone will still adore... youYou might also likeEmbed
