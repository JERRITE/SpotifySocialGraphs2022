Like I Care LyricsI'm paralyzed just listening to you
Now I am receptive
I know you sleep so sound every night
And you are deceptive

It always feels good to be right
And if it helps you sleep at night
I'll tell you what you want to hear
And act like I care

It always feels good to be right
And if it helps you sleep at night
I'll tell you what you want to hear
And act like I care
It always feels good to be right
And if it helps you sleep at night
I'll tell you what you want to hear
And act like I care
And act like I care
And act like I careYou might also like1Embed
