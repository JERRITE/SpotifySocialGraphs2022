TranslationsPortuguêsWalk Above the City LyricsBright lights and tired streets
We could get away
No time to even speak
Nothing to say
No rain or storms above
That could make us stay
Let’s walk above the city
You and I

Flowers underneath us now
Towers underneath us now
We walk above the city
You and I
And we’re breathing more
Than we ever have before
And it goes oooh, oooh

Cars are underneath us now
The stars are underneath us now
We walk above the city
You and I

Flowеrs underneath us now
The towеrs underneath us now
We walk above the city
You and I

And we’re breathing more
Than we ever have before
And it goes oooh, ooohYou might also like1Embed
