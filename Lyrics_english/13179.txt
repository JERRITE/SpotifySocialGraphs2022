Coolest Place In The World Lyrics[Verse 1]
You appeal to a girl like me
Told me every blessing has a scar and
Love is held in the cathedral
God exists between people, homie
Humans fuck up more than anyone else and we
Shouldn't be scared to want less
But you're in love with four people and you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Humans fuck up, humans fuck up
And I'll fuck this up 'cause this blessing's a scar
And all that I know is
[Chorus]
I just think anywhere that you are
Coolest place in the world, coolest place
I just think anywhere that you are
Coolest place in the world
Coolest place in the world

[Verse 2]
Promised me we would sleep
Frankincense got me high
You told me about school
How your trauma blew up into art, you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Humans fuck up, humans fuck up
And I'll fuck this up 'cause this blessing's a scar
And all that I know is

[Chorus]
I just think anywhere that you are
Coolest place in the world, coolest place
I just think anywhere that you are
Coolest place in the world, coolest place
I just think anywhere that you are
Coolest place in the world, coolest place
I just think anywhere that you areYou might also like3Embed
