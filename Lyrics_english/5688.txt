Run with Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now we're gonna set fire to last year
Said goodbye to the songs and the old dreams we held dear
Setbacks and all of those dead ends
And a million reasons why we gotta give it in

[Hook]
We're all in it for the long road
We're all in it for life

[Chorus 1]
Run with me baby
I need you more than ever
I won't let you
Won't let you down
[Verse 2]
Said all of those things that we don't mean
We get caught up in the moment and forget who we are meant to be
I'll meet you at the eye of the storm
Bring your kind heart with you cause you know we're gonna need it once more

[Hook]
We're all in it for the long road
We're all in it for life

[Chorus 1]
Run with me baby
I need you more than ever
I won't let you
Won't let you down

[Chorus 2]
Come with me darling
I swear we gonna make it
I won't let you
Won't let you down

[Bridge]
And all through winter I've
Been dancing with an angel
She says we'll be fine
Oh I
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Run with me baby
I need you more than ever
I won't let you
Won't let you down

[Chorus 2]
Come with me darling
I swear we gonna make it
I won't let you
Won't let you down

[Outro]
I won't let you
Won't let you downEmbed
