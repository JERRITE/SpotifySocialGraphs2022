Heart Mind Lyrics[Intro: Kodak Black]
It's like, dawg, I ain't even got no self control no more
(Sonny Digital)
I be tryna keep it gangster and shit but youâ€”
You be havin' me on that sweet shit

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side, swear I'll die
Girl, you got me, you don't need nobody
I'm in love with you, not just yo' body
And I hope we never separate
I'm wonderin', do you feel the same?
[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Girl, you got me, ain't gotta look no more
I'm all yours, only if you want me to
And there ain't no pressure, I ain't no rushin' nigga
But bae, I got a lotta feelings for you
I got different stashes, dawg, I love them routes
But I got all this money in my CD account
You see I'm gettin' all the cheese like Mickey Mouse
Would you still be here if I'm goin' through a drought?
You in or out bae? What you about bae?
Do you want my heart bae? Or you want my clout bae?
You got my heart, you got my soul, you got my mental
I'm talkin' 'bout you even on these instrumentals

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side, swear I'll die
Girl, you got me, you don't need nobody
I'm in love with you, not just yo' body
And I hope we never separate
I'm wonderin', do you feel the same?

[Verse 2: Plies]
You know I love you babe, I'll help you take your weave out
You know I'm fucked up 'bout you, sittin' around your people house
If I was Kodak right now, baby, I would sing to you
I don't even like to kiss but I be kissin' you
I could smell you on my sheets, it got me missin' you
You ain't no PS4 or NES so I don't play with you
I don't even like to cuddle but I be holdin' on to you
I know this shit get dead real 'cause I be claiming you
I had a dream you fucked around and put my name on you
I was ashamed of my last bitch but I ain't ashamed of you
I ain't a bond baby, I hope we never separate
When you ain't around, them hoes around, I keep a poker face
I love lookin' at you, I got you as my screensaver
Sometimes I don't know how you stay around 'cause I'm so complicated
You my red velvet babe, I want a slice of you
And I can see myself spendin' my whole life wit' you
You might also like[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side, swear I'll die
Girl, you got me, you don't need nobody
I'm in love with you, not just yo' body
And I hope we never separate
I'm wonderin', do you feel the same?6Embed
