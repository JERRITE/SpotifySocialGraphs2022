Shut up your lyrics ["Key Tu" letter] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Greet the sun one more morning 
 There is a silence in your head 
 Who lifted her to think 
 In front of the mirror whispering 
 "I do not want more" 
 I decided to fly without you, enjoy my loneliness 
 That I don't love you today, no 
 I'm tired of listening that you will change 
 Your hypocrisy does not go 
 I no longer wait for you 
 [Chorus] 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 
 I no longer wait for you 

 [Verse 2] 
 She left and will never come back 
 In the reflection he began to dance 
 Surviving your reality 
 Left the account already paid 
 Nobody needs to love 
 Why nobody controls her more 
 Without that shadow, it will only shine 
 And never shut up again 

 [Chorus] 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 
 Shut up 

 [Bridge] 
 I'm tired of listening that you will change 
 Your hypocrisy does not go (no, no) 
 Don't bother to call, or shout more 
 Today the same blow sinks you 
 I don't shut up today (SHH)
