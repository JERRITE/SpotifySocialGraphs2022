In the Shadows Lyrics[Intro]
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 1]
No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes
I feel like goin' down
I'm so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows
In the shadows

[Verse 2]
They say
That I must learn to kill
Before I can feel safe
But I, I'd rather kill myself
Than turn into their slave

Sometimes
I feel that I should go
And play with the thunder
Somehow
I just don't wanna stay
And wait for a wonder

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life

[Bridge]
Lately, I've been
Walkin', walkin'
In circles, watchin'
Waitin' for somethin'
Feel me, touch me
Heal me, come, take me higher

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life
[Outro]
I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
I've been searchin'
I've been livin' for tomorrows
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows
In the shadows
I've been waitin'5Embed
