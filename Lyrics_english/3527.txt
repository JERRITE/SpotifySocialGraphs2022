NAV - Wanted You (feat. Lil uzi vert) [German translation] lyrics [intro: lil uzi vert & girl]
Where are you?
At my home
Let me see this ass
I beg your pardon?
I said "Let me see this ass"
This ass
Oh, you are on a nude trip
Hahaha
I'm on my way
stop lying
I'm on the way, bye
[Part 1: NAV]
I am ashamed of all the things I have done for you
Should have known that all these girls are the same and not loyal
She is a crazy one, led her to the Nobu, on a beach (yeah)
Just for eating, louboutins on their feet (yeah)
Where did you get the money for the shoes, girls?
You turned me on via direct message like a fangirl (whoa, whoa)
Did you want me or did you want this bundle of money, girl? (Whoa, whoa)
Now I know you are just another Instagram girl (whoa, whoa)
She almost made me think that she only wants me (Yeah)
I enter the club and it is the first to see
Said she would be there because she knows organizers in the club (Yeah)
Came just to find out that my friend ranked at her (whoa, who, who, who)

[Hook: NAV]
All of the ICE, I need a refrigerator, mhm
Pan it together, whisk, mhm
Whip two -seater high
Said she loves me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty in your collar
Fuck them, I don't know her, Yeah
Give me face like poker
Whoa, cannot believe that I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe that I wanted you, Yeah
Girl, I can't believe that I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe that I wanted you
You Might So Like [Part 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
No, no, no, no, I don't need you (I don't need you)
No, no, no, no, I don't need you (I don't need you)
Man, I swear, these girls are transparent (transparent)
Stevie Wonder, I can't see you (can't)
She is so hurt, I so annoyed, she gets on my nerve (what?)
My head hurts, fact, send it into the desert (bye!)
Found that she was with him, like this part: be killed (he?)
My creak, scattered Eagle, yeah
Probably dies before it hurts, Aye
Cartier glasses, I'm on the wait
Twenty thousand for a fur, ouh (yeah)
What kind of handbag would she do? (He?)
She said she gives me a perc (thirty)
My new bitch better so that I didn't go back to her
Does not speak to the girl, that's a removal (what now)
Speaking of sweaters, my neck is so frozen, it looks exactly like an iceberg

[Hook: NAV]
All of the ICE, I need a refrigerator, mhm
Pan it together, whisk, mhm
Whip two -seater high
Said she loves me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty in your collar
Fuck them, I don't know her, Yeah
Give me face like poker
Whoa, cannot believe that I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe that I wanted you, Yeah
Girl, I can't believe that I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe that I wanted you
[Part 3: Lil Uzi Vert & NAV (both)]
Uzi, they made fun of you (make yourself chic)
Yeah, all my hundreds of blue
Woah, little bitch, I'm done with you (I'm done with you)
Take yourself from behind while Uzi stands in front of you (Yeah)
23, but she had when I was 22 (what?)
I can't marry the girl, she fucked about twenty types (brown boy)
You can't get a kiss, you can't be caught how I lick you (lil uzi)
I have a lot of girls, no, there is not just one of your kind (that's right)
Off-White on my Prestos, all these girls I run through (I do it)
I can't write back to her, these are Franklin's what I leaf through (blue Hunnis)
Fuck on a finger in the bitch, I use a thumb or two (yeah)
Made it number one and you are not even number two
