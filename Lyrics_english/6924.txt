My eyes die with the sun, the flowers lengthen
I pick up the fruit 'I brought my', bath my voice in cane (-Ã±a)
Dance Dance; The moon looks at me and dances me
I had never seen such a place, cries at dawn
Eva's children, Adam's parents, none are saved
Sin of past lives, bite apple, there is no calm day
My next activity here will have to cure your soul
None of my fucking generation was born to take this load

[Pre-Caro: Duki, Ysy A, C.R.O]

That I do not think of Na ', only on waste (-Rroche, -Rroche, -Rroche)
Mommy, I'm going very fast, I don't want a Porsche (EH, EH, EH, EH-EH-EH)
Mommy, I want what I have and what I am looking for

[Chorus: Duki, C.R.O]
Because I'm a son 'e the night (night), I'm a son' e the night (night)
