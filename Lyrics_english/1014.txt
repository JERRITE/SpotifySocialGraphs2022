You are the Reason (French duet version) Lyrics [Verse 1: Calum Scott & Barbara Pravi]
There Goes My Heart Beating
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
Like fragile gleams
From the sun to the fall
My heart scroll through
Defeated

[Chorus/Refrain: Calum Scott, Barbara Pravi, Both]
He does not care that I retain
Sounds and colors
When tears come to me
Like fall before the hour
Oh, 'cause i need you to see
That you are the reason
[Verse 2: Calum Scott, Barbara Pravi, Both]
Like sudden anger
Clouds in the fall
I pour my pain
Dawn
If we came back to our steps
I would return weapons to all our fights
To love you without fear and regret
Would you be ready?

[Chorus/Refrain: Calum Scott & Barbara Pravi, Both]
He does not care that I retain
Sounds and colors
When tears come to me
Like fall before the hour
Oh, 'cause i need you to see
That you are the reason

[Bridge: Calum Scott]
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back, i need you to hold me
(You are the reason)
A Little Closer Now, Just A Little Closer Now
Come a little closer, i need you to hold me tonight

He does not care that I retain
Sounds and colors
When tears come to me
Like fall before the hour
Oh, 'cause i need you to see
That you are the reasonembed
