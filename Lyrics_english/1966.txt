One year without rain lyrics [letter of "one year without rain"]

[Intro]
UH-UH, UH-UH

[Verse 1]
Say what do you feel when I think of you
And again
Every moment you are not next to me
My world is the other way around
I walk in a desert when you leave (oh)
I don't know if it's a mirage, I feel so real, baby
[Chorus]
I want to see you again
To calm my thirst
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
If you escape again
I will not survive
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
OH-OH, WHOA

[Verse 2]
Counting stars
I hear in my mind your voice (mind your voice)
Do you hear mine?
My heart is suffering loneliness
I am a disorder
Way on dry leaves if you're not here
In my life
Return, that a flood will cry for you
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
I want to see you again
To calm my thirst
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
If you escape again
I will not survive
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
OH-OH, WHOA

Return here, open me
I am a desert without your love
Come back to me, don't be like that
Because one day without you is like a year without seeing rain

[Chorus]
I want to see you again
To calm my thirst
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
If you escape again
I will not survive
One day without you is like a year without seeing rain
OH-OH, WHOA
