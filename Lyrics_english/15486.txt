Freestyle Session #11 Lyrics [Freestyle Session #11 "]

[Enter: Zaramay]
Yeah, Zaramay, Baby
HUH
You know '(rra)

[Verse 1: Zaramay]
The kiosk is now from the skinny, I don't even know where you go (Plah)
If I shoot a video clip and they stayed the clipper without ga '
I fell on ahead and we go out for Atrá '(Huh)
These bitch 'Look for me war mel' the world asks Paz (Huh)
Vení Pa'l Hood with your chain ', do not hesitate by cap (no)
And if I do not ban, 'a problem, shut up and sharpen the pencil' (Afilen)
I could enter for the villa and come for private neighborhood
A imported perfume day and the other cut neck (ah)
I have the shotgun and I do not escape a hare
The more my name uploads, the more the fever will raise you (you heard?)
At first glance I know if you are drunk without being a goldsmith
The Grinch came to ruin your 24 'E December (did you hear?)
From the bed pa'l Camaro and from Camaro al Camarín
These wood rapper ended sawdust
Zara is untouchable, like Nicolino above 'the ring (you know')
Zara is untouchable, as the mayor in San Martín
If I have my finger the trigger the gun does not stop
We stayed 'with the throne and kidnapper' to your baby
They deported the flow, they held it in the customs
I made it pass through YouTube and on the plane marijuana (passed)
I will throw you when you have a level to answer me (rra)
I'm still waiting for those who said they got off (Rra-ta-ta)
I struggled to go up and if I got up it is to stay
And never make pa 'war, wey, nor are they going to get off
What happened, Mr. Agent? Does it see me face 'e offender?
The Billboard said, I am from Malianteo the referent
The rapper 'talk about more but the numbers do not lie
I came surfing the new wave and the pressure feels (wah)
If they make watch 'the saint' is pa 'that my career fails (huh)
I send them the location and fix it 'on the street (you heard?)
When they need bars they just paste a tubaz
The platform is pa 'raperos and the circus for clown', Bitch
[Interlude: Homer the mere mere]
The head of the Maliaroo
This is not music, it's drugs, huh

[Verse 2: homer the mere mere]
This goes 'to' my boys
For the taco, for the Nico
They left just when I need them most (ey, ey)
Just when we were sworn to the Gauchito (Gil)
I went to my life between miseries and crimes (gang, gang)
Mommy, give me the climb that I need so much (ah)
Mommy, I already achieved what I dreamed since I was a child (from Kid)
The most son 'and whore that walks in the circuit (the mere)
The rappers cornera when I grab the micro (the mic)
In Encapucha'o Street I did a fine work (Pew-Pew-PEW)
Each one has its destination hanging in the neck (Shoot, Shoot, Shoot)
I had to walk in clandestine sites
And now I release tickets every time I rhyme
Life puts you in the place that does not expect '
Now the money arrived but I left dad
And while the neighborhood calls, it claims a little more
I let go without problem, I always have one more theme (Pew, Pew, Pew)
Ask for the track, Zaramay, do you want one more? (One more)
I walk with 9 ahead and 40 back (Pew-Pew)
Those who yesterday made me now ask me peace (Fakes)
False rochos, just shoot if he took the alplax
The mere beats, here there is no chucu, dad (pew)
If anyone puts me against the salt 'to hunt (Plah-Play)
Visit with money, brother, make it pass (Yeah, Yeah)
That the eggs' support me if I start singing (Yeah, Yeah), Fuck That Shit
