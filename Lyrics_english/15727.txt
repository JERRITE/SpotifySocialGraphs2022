By your side Lyrics [intro: Alfonso & Dulce]
Ooh, ooh
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA

[Verse 1: Christian & Christopher]
Despite some stories
And the rain on the road
By your side, I know that destiny is
Despite the strong wind
Despite the shipwrecks
By your side, I know I'm safe
[Pre-Caro: Alfonso & Anahí]
You make me invincible
I don't know the impossible
If I turn and find you here
Let me live near you, always by your side

[Chorus: RBD, Dulce, Maite & Anahí]
At the edge of a kiss (to the shore)
At the edge of your hands (your hands)
Let me always live by your side (by your side)
At the shore of a sigh (to the shore)
At the edge of your hug (your hug)
Let me always live by your side
Always by your side, always by your side

[Poster: sweet]
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA
NA-NA-NA

[Verse 2: Christian & Christopher]
Despite the storm
That hits our boat
By your side, I'm always calm
Despite the difficult
Despite the stumbling
At your side nothing scares me

[Chorus: RBD, Dulce, Maite & Anahí]
At the edge of a kiss (to the shore)

At the shore of a sigh (to the shore)
At the edge of your hug (your hug)
Let me always live by your side
Always by your side, always by your side
At the edge of a kiss (to the shore)
At the edge of your hands (your hands)
Let me always live by your side (by your side)
At the shore of a sigh (to the shore)
At the edge of your hug (your hug)

Always by your side, always by your side1embed
