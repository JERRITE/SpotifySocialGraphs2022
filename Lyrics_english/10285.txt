Freaking Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lately, right now, I feel like it's all over
'Cause I've been trapped inside my head for so long
I'm sorry, I should've called when I was sober
Some days, I get scared to be alone

[Chorus]
I, I'm blacking out and I can't help it
I, I scream and shout and I can't help it
Sleeping with the light on every night
I can't stand my bedroom, I put blankets on the couch, woah
It's killing me, I'm burning up inside, woah
I'm a mess right now and I'm just freaking out
I'm seeing sounds, I'm freaking out
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm freaking out
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I, I'm freaking out

[Verse 2]
It's stupid, but I'm better off when I stay quiet
'Cause I push away all the ones that hold me close
I'm losing my mind, oh yeah, I just can't take it, no
I'm in the corner, yeah, I'm bleeding on the ropes

[Chorus]
Woah, I, I'm blacking out and I can't help it
I, I scream and shout and I can't help it
Sleeping with the light on every night
I can't stand my bedroom, I put blankets on the couch, woah
It's killing me, I'm burning up inside, woah
And I'm a mess right now and I'm just freaking out
I'm seeing sounds, I'm freaking out

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm freaking out
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I, I'm freaking out
