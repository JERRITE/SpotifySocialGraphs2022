Steal a kiss Lyrics [letter from "steal a kiss" ft. Sebastian Yatra]

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
Yatra, Yatra

[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
It is many years that spent without saying I love you
And I really love you
But I find ways to deceive my heart
It is many years that spent without stealing a kiss
I just want a kiss
And in that mouth I don't care to be a thief
It can't be that I haven't found words yet
And on that night I didn't say anything
It can't be that in a second I got lost in your gaze
When inside I shouted you
[Choir: Sebastián Yatra, Carlos Vives]
Let me steal a kiss that reaches me to my soul
Like a vallenato of those old people we liked
I know you feel butterflies, I also felt their wings
Let me steal a kiss that fell in love and you don't leave
Let me steal a kiss that reaches me to my soul
Like a vallenato of those old people we liked
I know you feel butterflies, I also felt their wings
Let me steal a kiss that fell in love and you don't leave

[Verse 2: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
Let me steal your heart
Let me write a song
Let me that with a kiss we lost both
Let me steal your heart
Let me upload to this song
To dance together like nobody danced

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
Let me steal a kiss that reaches me to my soul
Like a vallenato of those old people we liked
I know you feel butterflies, I also felt their wings
Let me steal a kiss that fell in love and you don't leave

[Bridge: Carlos Vives]
I know that you like that I sing to you like this
That you put yourself serious but I make you laugh
I know you love me why you are like this
And when we are together I don't know what to say
I know that you like that I sing to you like this
That you put yourself serious but I make you laugh
I know you love me because you are like this
And when we are together I don't know what to say

Let me steal a kiss that reaches me to my soul
Like a vallenato of those old people we liked
I know you feel butterflies (I know you feel butterflies)
I also felt his wings (I also felt his wings)
Let me steal a kiss that fell in love and you don't leave
Let me steal a kiss that reaches me to my soul
Like a vallenato of those old people we liked
I know you feel butterflies, I also felt their wings
Let me steal a kiss that fell in love
And you don't go2embed
