5 senses lyrics [letter of "5 senses"]

[Verse 1: Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
I fell in love for the first time
No one told me what was going to happen
And now I'm so good here at Eden with you
Lying in the armchair only with your body around me
I'm getting more and more alive

[Pre-Caro: Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
I fought with my ghosts
All those who someday shouted me
That will renounce everything that I have been
I do not regret
Do not shoot the keys practical the moment
You feed me the five senses
[Choir: Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
I want to be drunk
Living my life, but by your side
Drinking Tequila of any glass
Breaking the line if you leave
I have never been a saint
I don't sell smuggling lessons
Of all my bones you are in command
I get tangled up with you in this hurricane

[Post-Coro: Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Andrés Dvicio]
I lost a thousand trains at the station
I changed level, I climbed a step
And now I know that everything I lacked appeared with you

[Pre-Caro: Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
I fought with my ghosts
All those who someday shouted me
That will renounce everything that I have been
I do not regret
Do not shoot the keys practical the moment
You feed me the five senses

Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh

[Choir: stool, Andrés Dvicio & Stool]
I want to be drunk
Living my life, but by your side
Drinking Tequila of any glass
Breaking the line if you leave
I have never been a saint
I don't sell smuggling lessons
Of all my bones you are in command
I get tangled up with you in this hurricane

Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
(A hurricane, a hurricane with you)
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh
Just with you, oh-oh

[Outro: Andrés Dvicio, stool & both]

No one told me what was going to happen
And now I'm so good here at Eden with you1embed
