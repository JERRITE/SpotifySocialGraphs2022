Fight Me Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy
Y'all bitches do all that net talk
But what the fuck is up? Bitch
Ayy

[Chorus]
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (Fight me bitch)
But I know that's unlike you bitch (You ain't 'bout it)
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (Bitch, what's up?)
Don't jump on the net and write me, bitch (Don't do it)
If you don't like me bitch, fight me, bitch (Fight me bitch)
I feel like Dej, try me bitch (Try me bitch)
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (What's up?)
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (Bitch, what's up?)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, how you doin'? My name Molly (Molly B)
Current mood: fuck everybody (Fuck you)
You don't like my attitude? Then sorry (I ain't sorry)
I throw these bitches like a party (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They say they gone jump me, I dare 'em to try (I dare you bitch)
It's gone be weave everywhere like the beauty supply (hahahaha)
I feel like Pac, I'm ready to ride (Skrt, skrt)
You think you big? You ready to die? (Huh?)

[Bridge]
Ho, I ain't never scared (Never)
20 deep in this bitch, we came well-prepared (Gang, gang, gang)
Ho, I ain't never scared (Bitch, never)
20 deep in this bitch, we came well-prepared (Gang, gang)

[Chorus]
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (Fight me bitch)
But I know that's unlike you bitch (You ain't 'bout it)

Passin' hoes up like they standin' still (I'm gone)
Ayy, y'all look like y'all shop at Foreman Mills (Fuck bitch)
Stomp yo ass out in some four-inch heels (What's up?)
You probably run the scene like Lauren Hill
I'm high as hell, I'm on the pill (High as fuck)
My bro locked up, tryna get a appeal
Shit get real in the field (It's real)
Some niggas die, some niggas kill
If you don't like me, it's on sight (It's on sight)
You coppin' pleas, that's that shit I don't like (I don't like it)

[Bridge]
Ayy, ho, I ain't never scared (Never scared)
Draco in the whip, we came well-prepared

If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (What's up?)
If you don't like me bitch, fight me bitch (Bitch, what's up?)Embed
