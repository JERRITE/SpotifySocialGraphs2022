The Lyricsel Damage Count of damage
Of your love holocaust ...
They are incalculable and irreparable
There is too much destruction ...

Tears that do not get
Turn off the fire in me;
There are dead illusions everywhere;
There are only ruins of me ...

In the counting of damage
Of the terrible clash between the two ...
Of the firm impact of your hands
I did not survive my precaution ...
In the counting of damage
You leave me very much love
I can't believe what I heard
How can you say that I will forget you?

(CHORUS:)
Oooh no! no no no
No, I can't replace
From that kiss that goes up to heaven
What is the same
That now sinks me into hell
Ooh no! ooh no!

Oooh no! no no no
No, I can't replace
Your cruel way of hugging me
If you knew you were not going to love me
What did you earn?
What did you earn?
With kissing me

In the counting of damage
I lost everything
I lost my house and my friends
I gave everything to me ...
You Might Also Likentre The missing:
My resistance and my will ...
And there is something mutilated that I have thought
What maybe it was my dignity ...
