Call Me Never Lyrics[Intro]
Call me never, said I'd rather be alone, but I'm
Fallin' head first, back to get her, here we go

[Verse 1]
Oh, my God, I'm going out of my mind
I gotta get myself together 'cause I'm dyin' inside
I put my feelings in a letter then I swallowed my pride
I sent it fifteen minutes late, I can't believe she replied

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "You're the one I have been waitin' for"
But then she ran away, I don't see her anymore
I guess it's better if
[Chorus]
You call me never, said I'd rather be alone, but I'm
Fallin' head first, back to get her, here we go
So just go ahead and tell your friends California's calling once again
I'll do whatever it takes to, to get her

[Verse 2]
Oh, my God, I think I did it again
Thought we were getting back together, but we ended as friends
I put a smile on my face, but it's hard to pretend
You've given every little part I love about you to him

[Pre-Chorus]
I told her, "You're the one, but I can't wait no more"
And then she turned and said, "If that's the case, there's the door"
I guess it's better if

[Chorus]
You call me never, said I'd rather be alone, but I'm
Fallin' head first, back to get her, here we go
So just go ahead and tell your friends California's calling once again
I'll do whatever it takes to, to get her

[Bridge]
And I'll do whatever it takes to get her
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll do whatever it takes to get her
I'll do whatever it takes
You might also like[Chorus]
Call me never, said I'd rather be alone, but I'm
Fallin' head first, back to get her, here we go
So just go ahead and tell your friends California's calling once again
I'll do whatever it takes to, to get herEmbed
