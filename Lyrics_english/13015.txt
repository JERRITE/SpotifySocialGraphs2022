January 19th LyricsIntro: (Edmund)
You know I saw you sitting down, This is recording right?
This is Edmund, here at blue hole

(Verse 1)
Today marks three since I lost a brother
I struggle at the though of his sister and mother
January 19th makes me stutter till I suffocate the fact that I'll lose another
Cause the good times keep on coming but the good times never last
Time it keep on moving and it keep on moving fast
Good times keep on coming but the good times never last
Cause that time it keeps on moving and it keeps on moving fast
Like
9/11 it's a flashbulb memory
Remembering the energy
Like
"What the fuck you telling me?"
Yelling please cause the reapers on a killing spree
Takes my friends but he never takes my enemy's
If the devil is a broad I think she feeling me
Cause she never takes the ones that it's suppose to be
Misery sure loves her some company
Everyday in my ear, she whisper "come to me"
(Hook: Edmund)
You know why I do it? Coincidence that we bump into each other again
I look at you last night, sitting In the park by yourself, and when the drums were playing, you were moving

(Verse II)
Up, growing up in the south
Slim chance they ain't shady when they're running their mouth AHH
How ironic
Sunshine state so dark it's demonic
Trust me when I say I know plenty people
Don't go knocking on the door if they got a peephole
Come around for possessions like they working repo
They can get this hard wood like its Home Depot
Trust me when I say I know plenty people
Only fun when your funds they be looking Rico
Only grub when the chum its smellin Rico
Other than that send you back like your crossed the rio
Trust me when I say I know plenty people
Made the prequel but they never wanted part of the sequel
And in sequence I have lost almost all my Chicos
Trust me when I say I knew people

(Hook: Edmund)
And when the drum was playing, you was moving
And till that, you moved right up
And then right up to where it is
Right?
Is that not so?
I was there
You might also like(Bridge)
Coming from a city where the woman looking pretty but their attitudes are shitty
Got damn what a pity
X4

(Edmund)
I was there, you know, and let me tell you brother
Welcome to Belize
And you are a part of us
And you are a Belize-an Isle home, and
This is your home

(Outro Verse)
Ignorant, ignorant
Ignorant man
That's the freaking title
Stirring up some waves till it goes create a tidal
Indias tsunami mixed with bombing Hiroshima
Bullets straying, when they're spraying
Radiate like Fukushima
When exploded and what follows?
Contaminating waters
That's mutations, mutilations of just everything we swallow
But the worry for this week
Is the weekend and the bottles and like every single rapper let me rhyme that with some models
How ironic cause the mottos
Of our idols are platonic, just like every Ad we see that makes our women go Demonic
When they look inside the mirror
And start looking at themselves
And what they can't see is that mainstreams not the option that will help
I don't know sizes or ideals
For the waist between your belts
But if you got it, then you got it, don't try being someone else
Know that we're not perfect, fail proof or bionic
I'll admit it I have fun
Psychedelics and narcotics
And I've drank about three rivers now my livers alcoholic
Things I've done bring Shivers make you quiver cringe and vomit
But my mind will still blow up if I'm afraid that I will bomb it
When I'm talking to a girl
I'm a wreck I do get nervous
And as kids we grew up timid trying to find a bigger purpose
To this big ass earth we live in
Birth the one thing given
Is a mind that's speaks your words so don't ever set a limit
Free your soul with all the things in life that let you live it
And if ever you get livid
Make it at the figments
Phantoms and the widgets
Behind TV screens and pigments
Radio waves promoting all the blind that only listen
To the stars in this weeks hip hop not the local politician
Rallying up his votes, mother natures new mortician
Tell me how's it's possible or possibly its logical that passively we pause the hope like children's case with father pope and please just know it's not a joke
Yellow news like inner yolks
I've learned that souls of richer folks are filled with mirrors gas and Smoke
(Laughs)
Unless evading taxes then they're real humanitarians
But only for the week like a Skittish vegetarian
Foreign freaks how weak like a British libertarian
Only time it's perfect planet, finished planetariums
Yeah, Bause Mason, Yeah
January 19th
Rest In Peace
X 4

(Edmund Outro)
This is your home, this is your home. ( you're my brother)
(Bean ahh, bean ahh)
I saw it! I saw it, last night
(Yeah haha)
I know that You know
I met, I met, I met, another friend
From Africa, his wife from Canada
And you know, and I, Edmund did with him the same
I give him love
And let me tell you something
Belize will always be your home1Embed
