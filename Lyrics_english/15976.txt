Play My Song LyricsEa yea

[VERSE: 1]
She said
Stay the night with my friends
Told her
Pick me up in that Benz
I know
Daddy got u that coup
And
You just tryna get loose
So
Be here in ten I be ready in five
Baby girl I get you right
Wanna
Do the things you don't do with him
Quit talking bout it lets do it then
Aye
They shit talking that ain't new to them
But I got homies that ain't cool with them
So keep it moving girl we through with them
Ya
Shawty looking cute, other one a freak
They just tryna cut, they ain't tryna sleep
[Chorus-2x]

Okay, here we go
We up all night long
I got this one rolled
Go ahead play my song
Lit that up
Burnt that down
Hit that up
About three or four rounds
Here we go
All night long
I got this one rolled
Play my song
Lit that up ya
Burnt that down
Hit that up ya
About three or four rounds

[VERSE: 2]

Baby you year round cool
Always stay the perfect weather
Hot as hell when you need to be
Just wanna chill when we together
Put you in the mood, who could do it better?
You know what it do, know I'm down for you whenever
People love to bring you down
When they see you coming up
Who knows why they even try
I don't really give a fuck
I got my family and my homies plus some juice inside my cup
Sunny days under palm trees
In the shade with a blunt
What-what
You might also like[Chorus-2x]

Okay, here we go
We up all night long
I got this one rolled
Go ahead play my song
Lit that up
Burnt that down
Hit that up
About three or four rounds
Here we go
All night long
I got this one rolled
Play my song
Lit that up ya
Burnt that down
Hit that up ya
About three or four rounds1Embed
