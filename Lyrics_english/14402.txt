You Can’t Keep It From Me Forever LyricsYou know what I want
You know what I need
You can't keep it from me forever
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
You can't keep it from me forever

Me, I know every trick in the book
Every trick by hook or by crook
I go on, I go on, I go on, I go on
I get too involved
Have done forever
That which I desire
That to which I do aspire
You can't keep it from me forever

Well I know every trick in the book
Every trick by hook or by crook
I'll go on, you'll go on, they'll go on, we'll go on
It's too involved
Has been forever

You know what I want
You know what I need
You can't keep it from me forever

You can't keep it from me forevеr, no, no, no
You can't keep it from me forever, no, no, no, no

Evеry trick in the book
Every trick by hook or by crook
I'll go on, you'll go on, they'll go on, we'll go on
It's too involved
(Has been forever)

Every trick in the book
Every trick by hook or by crook
I'll go on, I'll go on, I'll go on, I'll go on
I get too involved
(Has been forever)
