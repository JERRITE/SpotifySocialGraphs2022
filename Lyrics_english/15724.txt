Take me lyrics ["Take me" letter]]

[Chorus: C.R.O]
And what to tell you to stay if you are going to escape again
And what to tell you to wait for me if the road will be the same
Riding the Street, Woman and Weed from my place
Give him, baby; Leave me, graze it, dance me, take me to dream, and just dream

[Verse 1: Homer; C.R.O]
I spent a great time playing to be sane and it didn't suit me
Following your aroma for sites and areas that I did not know
Your tattooed chest and his ironed hair, something confused me
His eyes have no pattern or forgiveness of the Lord one day
I live from Business and Business forces me to play relaxed
I am not to blame if any other whore excites the market
I want to have to sell what I have never paid
Now I only think about winning and forgetting what we had talked about
Forgotten business is an issue that I want to close
It is an issue that I want to forget, a wolf that I want to hunt
My destiny I leave it randomly, I know that it will achieve that
We already pay the game price and we have to start again
I don't want to lie to you or ask you to forget everything that happened
If the memory is already mine, I win and lose it, the same makes nothing sense
It was never anything, the same that so personal that you had that time with me (no, no)
I only know that it is normal in my way of acting, leaving everything in fucking forgetting (uh, no, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus: C.R.O]
And what to tell you to stay if you are going to escape again
And what to tell you to wait for me if the road will be the same
Riding the Street, Woman and Weed from my place
Give him, baby; Leave me, graze it, dance me, take me to dream, and just dream
And what to tell you to stay if you are going to escape again (no, no)
And what to tell you to wait for me if the road will be the same (no, no, no, no)
Riding the Street, Woman and Weed from my place
Give him, baby; Leave me, graze it, dance me, take me to dream, and just dream

[Verse 2: C.R.O]
And what to tell you that you stay
Mommy, I just want you to take me
I see your name for the walls
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
I want the thing to be brief
I want you to give me 'your pleasures
That I do 'what is not due
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
I only have one option and it's trying
Even if I am not right, for vo 'always to be
I want to see me wrong, let me escape
Even if I bring me betrayal, I swear I'm not going to drown
And what to tell you that you stay
Mommy, I just ask you to wait
Everyone knows what they want, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
I know this damages you and hurts you
Don't want to see me with another 'woman'
When I see you change the reliefs
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
So fine when talking (so fine when speaking)
His way of looking (his way of looking)
He tear me up, takes me to his bed, loves me, makes me perspire
His way of escaping, his way of conquering
Give him, baby; Leave me, graze it, dance me, take me to dream
