I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Oo-oo)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I look through the mirror
I don't see my face
I'm tryin' to find me (Tryin')
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' again
I'm tryna keep it cool
I look out to Venus
And search for a place
And sometimes I hate myself
I'm tryin', I'm cryin' again
I'm tryin' to keep it cool
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Oo-oo)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, thеn pop another one
My biggest еnemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

Can't see me cry, this is the end (Oo-oo)

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
P-Pop another one
Pop a 911, then pop another one
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Oo-oo)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Oo-oo)

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
When I cry like I'm a waterfall
And pour it out like alcohol
Would you raise your hands and catch it all?
Turn it to a swimming pool
When my blood is filled with cortisol
And I'm feeling like I'm flammable
I could do something so radical, ooh
Lately I'm feelin' so blue (Blue)
I know you're feelin' it too (Too)
If it's all getting way harder (Ooo)
Turn it up, party to Gaga
Lately I just wanna lose (Lose)
Switch it up, get it, renew (Oh)
When it's all getting way darker
Sometimes I just wanna go in the car (Ooo)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga & Charli XCX, Charli XCX]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Oo-oo)
Cry, can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Oo-oo)
Cry, can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Oo-ooo)

[Outro: Charli XCX]
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
No crying, no crying, no crying, no crying
No crying, no crying, no crying, no crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, oh
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, oh4Embed
