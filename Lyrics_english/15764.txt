Die without my lyrics [letter of "die without me"]

[Intro]
Yeah
The Movie Actor, BB
From another planet (Wuh)

[Chorus]
You're going to die without me, Mamacita, I know it (Skrt-Skrt)
And your words were taken by the wind, and from you I already forgot
With you I walked through the clouds, until I was landed
And tonight I go out for the street, and in nobody I'm going to believe
[Post-car]
Everything I spent with you (Skrt), to ’what I lived with you (prr-prr)
Pa 'ti I was never anything (skrt-skrt), now you do the same
The one who leaves tomorrow, maybe it will be my lucky day
I never want to see you, you will never have me again
You will return, you will return, baby
Where are you going? Tell me wherever you go, Yeh
I know that you want to be (eh-eh)
But I don't vo'a gives' a little longer, Yeh

[Verse]
I never lost you (Skrt-Skrt)
Who lost me, mommy, you went to me (prr-prr)
And this album I dedicate it to you (Yah)
I already recovered and now it's your turn to suffer, baby
All that time I had and undressed you (Wouh)
And my feelings failed again
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Now you're not one of us
Now that you see me winning
Now you wanna fuck with us, oh-yyah
Imma Flip This Shit A Hundred and That's a Stack
I'LL Never Put A Hoe Over My Money and That's a Fact, Nigga

[Chorus]
You're going to die without me, Mamacita, I know
And your words were taken by the wind, and from you I already forgot
With you I walked through the clouds, until I was landed
And tonight I go out for the street, and in nobody I'm going to believe
You Might Also Like [post-car]
Everything I spent with you (with you), to ’what I lived with you (with you)
Pa ’ti I was never anything, now you do the same
The one who leaves tomorrow, maybe it will be my lucky day
I never want to see you, you will never have me again

[Outro]
