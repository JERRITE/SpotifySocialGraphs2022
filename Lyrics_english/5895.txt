Youâ€™re a God Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got to be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies and that's okay
But there's somewhere beyond this, I know
But I hope I can find the words to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Never again, no
No never again

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a god and I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god and I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go
[Verse 2]
Though I've been unable to put you down
I'm still learnin' things I ought to know by now
It's under the table, so
I need somethin' more to show, somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
So never again, no
No, never again

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a god and I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god and I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go

[Verse 3]
I've got to be honest, I think you know
We're covered in lies and that's okay
But there's somewhere beyond this,I know
But I hope I can find the words to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Never again, no
No, never again

'Cause you're a god and I am not
And I just thought that you would know
You're a god and I am not
And I just thought I'd let you go

[Outro]
(You're a god) Oh, and I am not
(I just thought that you would know)
Oh, I thought that would you know
(You're a god) Oh, and I am not
(I just thought) I'd let you goEmbed
