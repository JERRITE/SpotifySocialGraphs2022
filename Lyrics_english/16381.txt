Rush, Rush Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's on the level
If he's inclined
A son of a devil
He wants mine and more
Oh, he's a high, high climber
Not just a clinging vine
He made the grade, he made his marks, it's secure
And guess who's keeping score?

[Chorus]
Rush, rush, got the yeyo?
Buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo
Rush, rush, got the yeyo? (Oh, oh)
Yo, yo, no, no, yeyo (Oh, oh)
[Post-Chorus]
Rush, rush
Rush, rush
Rush, rush
Rush, rush

[Verse 2]
He's a real speed demon
He's one of a kind
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder
He's running out of time

[Chorus]
Rush, rush to the yeyo
Buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)
Yo, yo, no, no, yeyo (Go, go)
Rush, rush to the yeyo

[Bridge]
Never, never take a chance before
But now he's in a hurry
Better, better make your mind up, boy
He's faster
(Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster)

[Chorus]
Rush, rush, gimme yeyo
Buzz, buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)
No, no, gimme yeyo
Yo, yo, got my yeyo (Oh, oh)

Rush, rush
Rush, rush
Rush, rush
Rush, rush
Rush, rush

[Verse 2]
He's a real speed demon
He's one of a kind
Watching, waiting, winking over his shoulder
He's running out of time

[Chorus]
Rush, rush to the yeyo (Rush, rush)
Buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo (Rush, rush)
Rush, rush, rush to the yeyo (Oh, oh)
(Rush, rush)
Buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)
(Rush, rush)
Go, go to the yeyo (No, no)
(Rush, rush)
Yo, yo, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)
(Rush, rush)
Buzz, buzz, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)
(Rush, rush)
Rush, rush, yeyo (Oh, oh)
(Rush, rush)
Buzz, buzz to the yeyo (Rush, rush)
Rush, rush, gimme yeyo (Rush, rush)
Rush, rush, rush, gimme yeyo (Oh, oh)2Embed
