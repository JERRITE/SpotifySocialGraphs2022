Death Note Lyrics[Intro: Lil Skies & GNAR]
I got demons in my brain
They want me to let her go
They want me to let her go
Bustdown glass all in the Patek
They just tryna kill me 'cause I have it
Demons in my brain and they wanna go
If I say I love you, you got my soul (Ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
I got demons in my brain, they want me to let her go
Shorty tell me I'm the same 'cause I'm fucking all these hoes, and
We been through the rain, we can make it through the snow
Heard them niggas throwing shade, fuck 'em all 'cause they broke
That's right
I signed my death note, what's hope?
Wrapped around my neck, a rope
I don't got time for lies and jokes
You gon' make me go Incredible Hulk
[Verse 1: GNAR]
She fuck with me, she don't fuck with you (Yeah), woah
Iced out my heart, now it's bulletproof, uh
I took my shot, gotta tell the truth (Yeah, yeah), woah
I'm kind of psycho, keep it real with you (Uh)
Stackin' bands, used to have no food, uh
Went through the pain, now I'm lettin' loose
Mixed hoes, white and black like a beetle soup, ayy
I mean beetle juice, shit, Gnarcotic gang
Misfit kids who fuck up shit, get fucked up quick
I know the feeling, you're knowing your vision
But no one listens, shit so sickening
Fuck that, big guap by the billion, I fuck your mistress (Uh)

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
I got demons in my brain, they want me to let her go
Shorty tell me I'm the same 'cause I'm fucking all these hoes, and
We been through the rain, we can make it through the snow
Heard them niggas throwing shade, fuck 'em all 'cause they broke
That's right
I signed my death note, what's hope?
Wrapped around my neck, a rope
I don't got time for lies and jokes
You gon' make me go Incredible Hulk

[Verse 2: Craig Xen]
Shawty, where your mind at? (Where your mind at?)
If I asked you to kick it then would you slide back? (Huh)
To my crib, I been going through a lot alone (Uh-huh)
I need somebody to kick it with when I'm at home
I'm headstrong, but my spirit got a hole in it (Got a hole in it)
I been open and hoping that you can come fill it (Hmm)
That's how I'm feeling, really I ain't ever wanna have to ask for help
Put pride to the side, I need it, aight? Slide tonight, damn

Wrapped around my neck, a rope

You gon' make me go Incredible Hulk
