TranslationsEnglishHere’s to Never Growing Up Lyrics[Intro]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"

[Verse 1]
Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change
[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say "forever"?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"
We'll be runnin' down the street yelling, "Kiss my ass"
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that"
When the sun's going down, we'll be raisin' our cups
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah, oh-woah
(Here's to never-growing-up)
Oh-woah, oh-woah
(Here's to never-growing-up)

[Verse 2]
We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change (Hell no!)
They say, "Just grow up"
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say "forever"?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"
We'll be runnin' down the street yelling, "Kiss my ass"
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that"
When the sun's going down, we'll be raisin' our cups
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah, oh-woah
(Here's to never-growing-up)
Oh-woah, oh-woah
(Here's to never-growing-up)

[Bridge]
Say, won't you say "forever"?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young
[Chorus]
(Oh) Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever (Ooh), but it's gettin' us drunk (Drunk, drunk)
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"
We'll be runnin' down the street yelling, "Kiss my ass"
I'm like, "Yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that" (Like that)
When the sun's going down, we'll be raisin' our cups
Singing, "Here's to never-growing-up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah, oh-woah
(Here's to never-growing-up)
Oh-woah, oh-woah (Oh, raise your glass and say)
Cheers, to never-growing-up

Oh-woah, oh-woah (Da-de-da-de-da-de)
(Here's to never-growing-up) No, we're never growin' up
Oh-woah, oh-woah (Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha)
