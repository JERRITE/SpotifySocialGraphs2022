Stay in My Corner Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't always be a winner babe
In fact, I'm bound to burn out
All these bumps in the road, dear
They're just lessons we learned
We learned

[Chorus]
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me too
[Verse 2]
They can steal away my soul
Hang it dangerously low
I don't care how far they go
Cause I've been down there before
Before

[Chorus]
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me too

[Bridge]
We sit together
Forever
By the color, TV glow
Telling stories, allegories
Letting ourselves go

[Chorus]
Stay in my corner, babe
Stay in my corner, please
Stay in my corner, babe
I will fight for you if you fight for me tooYou might also like3Embed
