(Touch you now, ma ')
Love your hair, Gatea, Satea
Cloth me on top, do whatever
Put me aggressive pa 'what you see'
You have lost control even if you don't believe it '(you know')
Flit the bed with the rags
If you are willing, then I am willing
Stay with me, don't put pretext
It will be easy, just follow the procedure (Dale)
Look for me under the friza, the breeze warns me
That you are in a hurry
A slow, slow, hard game for now
We have eight hours of entertainment
