TranslationPortuguêsfrançaisenglishdelirio of greatness Lyrics [letter of "delirium of greatness"]

[Verse]
Gold could more than my pain
You had no compassion on my agony
You knowing that my soul was dying
With friends between glasses you laughed
Ambition, delirium of greatness
Made a martyred being in me
Because I was madly in love '
Woman, I don't deserve that baseness
[Chorus]
I hope with the just time
What twists looking for an illusion of love
And you will return to me, I hope
I hope so
Woman without heart

[Interlude: Soulja boy]
MAN, IT’s Ridiculous
I GOT You So Delirious
Kiss Me Through The Phonе
While I Lick You Just Like Licorice
Man, it's ridiculous
I GOT YOU SO Dеlirious
Kiss Me Through The Phone
While I Lick You Just Like Licorice
Man, it's ridiculous
I GOT You So Delirious
Kiss Me Through The Phone
While I Lick You Just Like Licorice
MAN, IT’s Ridiculous
I GOT You So Delirious
Kiss Me Through The Phone
While I Lick You Just Like Licorice

[Chorus]
I hope with the just time
What twists looking for an illusion of love
And you will return to me, I hope
I hope so, woman without heartyou mihht Also like3embed
