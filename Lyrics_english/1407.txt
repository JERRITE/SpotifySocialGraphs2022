​casualty of your dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were on my mind all the time
Fell into a distraction with you, maybe once or twice
Plannin' out a future for two
What I'd do in a room all alone, only me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
You always lie when it's convenient
Guess you didn't mean it, but I'd still repeat it
If I could hold on to the feeling
Back when all your words still had their meaning
[Chorus]
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty
I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

[Post-Chorus]
Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ah, ah, ah
There's no need for apologies
'Causе honestly you're dead to mе

[Verse 2]
Dug yourself a grave, no surprise
Should've known better, so now it's time that you die in it
You got what you wanted from me
Made your bed, should've left
When you knew you would lie in it

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm good at keepin' secrets
You know that you're my weakness, and I'll always repeat it
If I could hold on to the feeling
Back when all your words still had their meaning
You might also like[Chorus]
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty
I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

[Post-Chorus]
Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ah, ah, ah
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly you're dead to me

[Interlude]
You're dead to me
Dead to me, dead to me
Honestly you're dead to me

[Bridge]
Green flags turned red from all my bleeding
I fell quickly for words, misleading
Don't come crawling back with your healing
'Cause I'm not strong enough to fight the feeling
[Chorus]
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty
I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

[Post-Chorus]
Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ah, ah, ah
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly you're dead to meEmbed
