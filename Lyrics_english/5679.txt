Shine A Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Light will lead the way to set you free
Cause I'm only looking for a little peace
And when the night falls
Oh call on me
Just don't forget to show me some mercy
Ooh, say you're mine
Ooh, take me higher

[Chorus]
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
[Verse 2]
Searching for some grace I'll tell you now
If I could hear your voice
How sweet the sound
Ooh, say you're mine
Ooh, take me higher

[Chorus]
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on me
Cause I was lost at sea
While the waves were dragging me underneath
(Woah) shine a light on
Shine a light on meYou might also like11Embed
