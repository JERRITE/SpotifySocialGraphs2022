[Chorus]
Be, be, be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest

[Verse 1]
Show up in the same dress
We don't know who wore it best
Not make a big deal
Act like it's a new trend
Look good when we go 'round here
Try on these boots
I found this boy who said you're sweet
He's got a best friend
(You'll always be my)

[Chorus]
Be, be, be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX
Be, be, be my BFF
'Cause IDK what's coming next
And I'll be LMHO with the rest
So TTYLXOX

[Verse 2]
I'm a better me when you're
Here next to me
LJK can't you tell we're ROTFFL?
Who needs words when we got hearts, smile
T-t-t-time goes by so fast
But we are meant to last
(You'll always be my)
