I was on the album perreating
And with her I got tangled (woh, oh, oh; fire!; Uah)

And is that it is turned on in fire (in fire)
That does not fall in love, she is for play (for play, oh)

By 'tar ricota I give you kick' and cheese
But we fight, never return and that's why (rrr!)
I want to go pa 'house, but you don't leave me (oh, oh, oh)
That ass and 'a threat, I already believe that ere' my partner (let's go!)
A Shot (EY), two shoot '(EY), the problem began
Because alcohol got into my system (PRR)
Who goes chotear already carries the complaint
Don't make me the blame, talk to her (fire!)
