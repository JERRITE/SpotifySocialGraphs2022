Hereâ€™s To Us Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're falling at your feet, giving everything up
There's something in the way, love is never enough
I see your sorry hand putting down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her, and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls aligned
But what we had, it never really died

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to us
[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I, we will never look back
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out, the fire was out

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

[Bridge:]
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us
Here's to us
