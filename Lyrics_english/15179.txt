Crucifire Lyrics[Verse 1]
F-f-f-feeling high and tight
That’s how I’m wired
Caught out in the light
Crucifire

[Chorus]
(Fire, fire, fire, Crucifire)
Oh, put me out
(Fire, fire, fire)
I say burn or put me out
[Verse 2]
Holy smoking in my bed
As we conspire
I think she's going to my head
Crucifire

[Chorus]
(Fire, fire, fire, Crucifire)
Oh, put me out
(Fire, fire, fire, Crucifire)
I say burn or put me out

[Verse 3]
Explosions in my chest
Strange supplier
If you got something to confess
I'm your Crucifire

[Outro]
(Fire, fire, fire, Crucifire)
Oh, put me out
(Fire, fire, fire, Crucifire)
I say burn or put me out
(Crucifire, Crucifire, Crucifire, Crucifire)
I say burn or put me out
(Crucifire, Crucifire, crucify, crucify, crucify)
I say burn or put me outYou might also like1Embed
