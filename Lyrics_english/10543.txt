Sweet Hibiscus Tea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here's the thing: I can't do anything right
Try as I absolutely totally might
The bones are melting, the skeleton is ash
The clavicle detaches and falls with a deafening crash

[Chorus]
And I'm not your protagonist, I'm not even my own
I don't know anything, I don't even know what I don't know
And if you look outside, you'll see disintegrating trees
The artificial way the sunlight bounces off the waxy leaves
My heart catches on every thorn, you're already halfway out the door
And I’ve never looked so old, and I have never been so cold
And it is 85 degrees, I don't know what I need
[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2]
There’s lukewarm herbal mango sweet hibiscus tea
On the hot garbage pile in which I fucking sleep
The walls are empty, it's so ugly, I could burn the whole place down
It wouldn’t catch ‘cause all the posters are on their way to my hometown

[Chorus]
And I am not your protagonist, I'm not even my own
I don't know anything, I don't even know what I don't know
And if you look outside, you'll see disintegrating trees
The artificial way the sunlight bounces off the glitching leaves
My wet heart catches on every thorn, you're already halfway out the door
And I'm so tiny and so old, and, God, it's never been so cold
And it is 85 degrees, I don't know what I need
