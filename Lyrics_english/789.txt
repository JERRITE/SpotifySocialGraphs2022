Solita Lyrics ["Solita" ft letter. Bad Bunny, Wisin & Almighty]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
(UH-UH, UH-UH)
Today he doesn't want to know the ex (no!)
Nor that no fools sticks
I will make it as it is (uh-oh!), Yeh
Tell where do you want me to arrive
I know that you, -uh -uh (uh)
You are starting for a long time (pa 'me)
Send a photo, tell me what there's pa 'me
That I love you for me, yeh
[Chorus: Ozuna]
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the thing' that you want '
In the way you want '
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the things you want'
In the way you want '(What do you think?)

[Verse 1: almighty]
Tell me if it awaits me 'alone
Do you have delivery or do the tail?
Are I disarming or I go with the gun?
The rolo always passed when I write
With the grass that you enrolo '
I have control, but she controls me
I feel Forever Alone, Cell in plane mode
Mixing pills with rum (wuh)
I have a Conne 'in the Bronx
That has more bombs than Donald Trump, Yeah
Booty big, all big
It falls in love when I get it
I never stay, I stay
I am like pina that has its plan B
'Pear in the kitchen, opens the marquee
What do I want to get you, neighbor
Do you like to wet you? I have a pool
Do you like retro? Those of your jevo are China '
Yes, China ', I know because I sponsor them
He was not the officer, but I officially put you in the office
Almighty!

She is Cuban and tells me: "Asere" (-sere!)
I sent you the location pa 'to wait for me' (Wo '!)
To 'shut up' that your boyfriend does not find out (no!)
'Tá hard without being operated (Wuh, Wuh, Wuh!)
He says that inside the plane (Yeh!)
It comes and shouts like Céline Dion (Wuh!)
A porn movie, but without the script (OH-OH)
Ear outside there is no embryo, Yeh, Yeh
With me to 'gucci, to' fendi
With your boyfriend or the Puma Fenty
Let the border leave, which has Mercedes
If you always have it empty
I know that you do not get with anyone
'Toy put pa' ti, pa 'do whatever you want

[Chorus: Ozuna]
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the things you want'
In the way you want '
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the things you want'
In the way you want '(What do you think?)
[Verse 3: ozuna]
If you wait for me alone, I vo 'to steal, my wolf
You with that buttock to'as you charge me
It doesn't let me pass a
For the baby I give my fortune
If you are looking for the Playlist in the Celu
You have Ozuna's songs
Mine is the baby
Trépeate and do it as you want
You tell me that I have flow to distribute to the one who doesn't
And if you are alone, alone, you quickly request
That I arrived in the Ferro, to eat me complete
Alone, alone, quickly request
That I arrived in the Ferro, to eat me complete
I know you like what I have
When he calls me, fast I attend

[Verse 4: wisin]
(W!)
Baby, wait for me in robe
Prepare the sata -face fire (Yeah)
In underwear it is portrayed
I have the computer, you have the data
We are traveling, you are the flight attendant
She nakes, kills me
He warms up, turns on, climbs (hey)
(I almost always get me)
Baby, give me what I want (heh!)
You know what I mean (heh!)
The steel man, the cowboy
I seized your body (hey, hey!)
I don't want but, give it first, with you I accelerate (hey, hey!)
Baby, give it soft, give it light, make me your prisoner
The baby stands out (it has the powers)
She is the most who knows (heh, hey, hey!)
He gets daring, he touches the hair
Bad face and wants me to record it (Yeah)
He wants it soft (everything she says)
May the light turn it off
A boss, looks at me in the face
It gets hot, does not want me to end
(You have to run with mine; Oh!)

[Chorus: Ozuna]
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the things you want'
In the way you want
What do you think if you expect me alone?
I think, mommy, that your body needs me
And I 'to'as the things you want'
In the way you want (what do you think?)
