I'm ready to pull up on you
I'm ready to do what I do
Baby, what you wanna do?
Shoot your shot 'cause I'm bulletproof (Yeah)
Load it up and doo-doo-doo (Doo-doo)
Baby, what you wanna do? (Do, do, do, do)
I'm ready to pull up on you (You, you, you, you)
I'm ready to do what I do (Do, do, do, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
This type shit have you wildin' (Ooh)
Last minute trips to the islands (Ooh)
Drip, drip, drip when you slide in (Ooh)
Fit, fit, fit, baby, right in (Ooh)
Don't hesitate when you (Ooh)
In it, 'cause you know I like it (Ooh)
Bakin' up a cake for you (Ooh)
Sweet, baby, like it when you bite it
[Chorus: Normani]
We can't just keep talkin' about it
We think too often about it
We can't just be cautious about it

Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild

Pull up inside me, baby (Boy)
Fuckin' it up like oopsie-daisy
Ain't no "If, ands, buts and maybes"
Don't be laid up in that shit likе you lazy
I need you to roll up in that shit like you skatin'
Baby, ain't no hold up, I'm that shit, I hate waitin', doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Shoot your shot, I'm impatient (Doo-doo-doo, ooh)

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Look, dímelo, turn me 'round
Treat me like a watch, bust me down
On the kitchen floor, right on that towel
It's my dick and I want it now, ow
Tell me how you want it
Put me on my back, on my stomach
Baby, let me blow it like a trumpet
I can do it all, I can probably suck a watermelon through a straw
Believe me, every other day, new wig, new hair
Come take me out this Mugler
I be waitin' on you with some lingerie
Drive this pussy down low like bombs away
Boom, nothing but a robe in your house
I wanna put these pretty pink toes in your mouth
Send nudes to your phone while you workin'
Boy, you gotta see this shit in person, believe me
[Chorus: Cardi B & Normani]
We can't just keep talkin' about it
I want you comin' inside it (Ooh)
We can't just be cautious about it
I wanna get wild
Take me for a ride, boy
Show me your wild side, boy
Know it's been a while, boy
I wanna get wild
