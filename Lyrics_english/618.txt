TranslationEnglishse prepared Lyrics [letter of "prepared"]

[Chorus]
He prepared
He got pretty, his friend called
He left rumba, nothing cared
Because her boyfriend cheated him as if nothing
She prepared
He got pretty, his friend called
He left rumba, nothing cared (he didn't care, oh-oh)
Because her boyfriend cheated him as if nothing (haha)
[Verse 1]
Leave, forget the penalty and suffering
The boyfriend made her cry, killed her feeling. '
Promised word 'that left with the wind
Now she says: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry"

[Pre-car]
Today she does what she wants
It is mounted on your ship to burn the road
Puts him in the dance with good music
Give him champagne and turn on in Candela, that e 'my baby
Today she does what she wants
It is mounted on your ship to burn the road
Puts him in the dance with good music
Give me the champagne and it turns on in Candela, that e 'my baby

[Chorus]
He prepared
He got pretty, his friend called
He left rumba (-ba), nothing cared
Because her boyfriend cheated him as if nothing
She prepared
He got pretty, his friend called
He left rumba, nothing cared (he didn't care, oh-oh)
Because her boyfriend cheated him as if nothing

That fool was lost to that cool mamacita
I saw her in the club, I imagine her naked
He has two friends' who look like a movie
That wherever they arrive they make the 'dem√°' look ridiculous'
A beautiful body
I assure you that since she is not two
He failed her and she rebelled
With her friend 'of Rumba, she came out, she was given

Give him champagne and turn on in Candela, that e 'my baby

Puts him in the dance with good music
Give me the champagne and it turns on in Candela, that e 'my baby
