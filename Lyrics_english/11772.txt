Your lyrics alarm)

[Verse 1]
I will swear that I will not call you
I don't talk to you again, I won't look for you
Because if you ask me for time all the time I will wait
To look at me like yesterday
That you are you again and love me again
Because if I said forever, I will love you forever

[Pre-car]
And if you leave because someone else can steal your heart
Stay mine and what I feel like both
[Chorus]
There is no one more like me
What a cold woman for giving you heat
That makes you cry but love
That turns your alarm creep
There is no one but loves you more
And if you go it will be the pain
What will make you understand that no one else loved you
Just like me

[Verse 2]
I never imagined that your mouth and mine
That night with a kiss would fall in love
But I didn't imagine how much it would hurt
Know what kisses in your mouth and are not mine
Mine forever but the usual
That one falls in love when the other does not feel it
But I'm sorry, I tell you straight ahead
You may get away but not enough

[Pre-car]
And if you leave because someone else can steal your heart
Stay mine and fuck the two

[Chorus]
There is no one more like me
That dies of cold for giving you heat
That makes you cry but love
That turns your alarm creep
There is no one but loves you more
And if you go it will be the pain
Who will make you understand that no one else loved you
Just like me
