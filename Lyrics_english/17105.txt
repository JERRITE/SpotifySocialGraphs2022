Got It Together Lyrics[Intro]
That ass on her had to come from her mama, yeah
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I turn shit to sugar, 20K for the booking
10K for the bodies, killer fly way from Brooklyn
I was in the streets, mama couldn't even whoop me
Daddy told me he wasn't raising no pussy
My son was rich 'fore he even came out the pussy
Step on your block if that button get pushed
I smoke exotic, don't pass me no kush
She talkin' crazy, bitch, you need to hush
Pack touch down, shit fill up a bus
12 at the door, too much to flush
Go get the money, yeah, that's a must
I keep it real, bitch, I'm one thousand plus
[Verse]
And I been thuggin', nobody touch me
Reach for my chain, get shot in your nugget
Lam' truck yellow, no mustard
Came from a hood full of hustlers
You from a hood full of busters
I make that bitch drive that dope to Augusta
No, I don't trust her
The bitch know better
No, I don't play when that shit 'bout that cheddar
Took me some time, but I got it together

[Chorus]
I turn shit to sugar, 20K for the booking
10K for the bodies, killer fly way from Brooklyn
I was in the streets, mama couldn't even whoop me
Daddy told me he wasn't raising no pussy
My son was rich 'fore he even came out the pussy
Step on your block if that button get pushed
I smoke exotic, don't pass me no kush
She talkin' crazy, bitch, you need to hush
Pack touch down, shit fill up a bus
12 at the door, too much to flush
Go get the money, yeah, that's a must
I keep it real, bitch, I'm one thousand plus

Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Off-White hoodie
Frostbite wrist like a slushy
Smokin' on dank, boy, this shit so musty
Got the streets hot like I jumped out the oven
Nothin' but some hundreds, blueberry muffins
No Nick Cannon, stay with them drummers
That ass on her had to come from her mama
Bank account full of fetty, got commas on commas
I'm the bossman, got runners on runnersEmbed
