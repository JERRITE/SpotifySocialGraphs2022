What He Donâ€™t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
He don't know that you've been coming around
He don't know that we've been out of bounds
Things we do are better left unsaid
'Cause you and me can never keep our heads

[Chorus]
What he don't know will never hurt him
What he don't know is I have changed
It's just a matter of time 'til it all comes down, down, down
'Til he hears the stories going 'round, 'round, 'round
What he don't know, what he don't know
[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm open to your every suggestion
Nothing you ask of me is out of the question
Things I wouldn't do, you got me doin'
And oh, what I wouldn't do for you

[Chorus]
What he don't know will never hurt him
What he don't know is I have changed
It's just a matter of time 'til it all comes down, down, down
'Til he hears the stories going 'round, 'round, 'round
What he don't know, what he don't know

[Outro]
What he don't know
What he don't know
What he don't know
What he don't knowYou might also likeEmbed
