Sailor On The Moon Lyrics[Intro: Masked Wolf]
They wanna see the real me, let me take off the mask (Mask)

[Verse 1: Masked Wolf]
First thing's first, I got shit I need to say (Need to say)
This a work trip, this is not a vacay (Vacay)
Chit-chats with the bank, everything in real estate (Work)
Well, I got a Benz, had that before I was paid (I was paid)
Money on my mind, the ideas never change (That's fact)
Old friends came back, that's some shit, I let it fade (Fade)
Thirty on my wrist, I'm just talking 'bout my age
IPhone tells the time, well, I need another face (Ayy)
My time ASAP, yeah, that's word to "Plain Jane" (Word)
Antisocial, introvert, in the house, closed drapes (Drapes)
I like it like that, studio, now he raps (Raps)
Seen the BM with a hat (Hat), ain't that my nightcap?
[Chorus: Masked Wolf]
My life is like a symphony, I'm focused on the bands (Focused on the bands)
Only high five I want is pay, cash in hand (Cash in hand)
Started in the ocean but I'm still holding the flag (Wave)
Sailor on the moon waving back, I had to land

[Verse 2: IDK]
Six figures in my inbox, I'm waiting for the light
Sky lounge with mimosa, I'm waiting for my flight
Keep the gun in the holster, I'm tryna be polite
Make a bitch nigga late, we ain't on the same time
Now who am I? Now who are you?
I got the sticks, he tryna blow it, that's a flute
I'm making money when I sleep, like where's the tooth?
Church, I'm the bishop, this the steal, I got the juice
No chuckin' deuce, no calling truce
I keep it casual, I keep it very loose
I keep a shooter by my side, I hope you hoop
All the shit you saying that you done, I hope you do

[Chorus: Masked Wolf]
My life is like a symphony, I'm focused on the bands (Focused on the bands)
Only high five I want is pay, cash in hand (Cash in hand)
Started in the ocean but I'm still holding the flag (Wave)
Sailor on the moon waving back, I had to land
You might also like[Verse 3: Masked Wolf]
Had to give back the supply and demand (Demand)
Working on your craft, there's no cash in advance (No cash)
I was working on the wave while you were playing in the sand (Right)
I was writing in the cave while you were throwing away grams (That's fact)
Please don't check me (Check), you never respect me (Respect)
Better check yourself before checks get messy (Ayy)
Trying to impress me, now you feeling empty (Ayy)
Know you got no drive, so how you want a Bentley? (How)
How are you investing? (Woah), party with confetti (Woah)
With the big dogs in the hills, chilling with Beverly (Beverly)
You ain't gonna mix it with me, we ain't doing medleys
I was busting raps since I heard "Mom's Spaghetti" ('Ghetti)

[Verse 4: KayCyy]
Yeah, look how far he came, I can't forget who gave a hand, yeah
I look how far we going and I think we need a plane, uh
They was moving oppy and they did it for a chain
Fresh fronto from the ocky store, I light it for my brain, uh
I heard he made some racks and never gave back to the gang
I heard he cappin' story, he ain't never faced no pain
Remember that one-bedroom crib, we shared a space and never complained
When I was fourteen, I got high for the first time and I made space, uh
Worked that nine to five and looked at my check, like, "This what I made?," uh
Give what I got to my mom and I took flight and I made a wave, uh
I'm in France, I'm in England, she a fan, yeah, uh
Bring it in, secure the bands before we land
[Chorus: Masked Wolf]
My life is like a symphony, I'm focused on the bands
Only high five I want is pay, cash in hand
Started in the ocean but I'm still holding the flag
Sailor on the moon waiving back, I had to land
My life is like a symphony, I'm focused on the bands (Focused on the bands)
Only high five I want is pay, cash in hand (Cash in hand)
Started in the ocean but I'm still holding the flag (Wave)
Sailor on the moon waiving back, I had to landEmbed
