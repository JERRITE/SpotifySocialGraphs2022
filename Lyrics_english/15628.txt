See you go lyrics ["see you go" ft letter. Brytiago, Nicky Jam & Darell]

[Intro: Brytiago & Anuel AA]
I have not forgot about you since I did it 'that night
It was a lie, I said that I loved you to feel it inside 'and you
Of your feeling 'I want anything, it was not for me to get used to it'
But you call me if you want sex
(OH-OH-OH, OH-OH, OH-OH)

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Darell]
Baby, you know 'what you are doing with me' (that's it; like that; you are '))
Because he doesn't make you smile (what knows; eh-eh)
Baby, I hate when you are doing '(hah-ha; uah, uah)
But for your buttocks I love seeing you (that is, like that; uah, uah)
My devil, today with me you are doing '(uah)
Because he doesn't even come to you (come)
Baby, I hate when you are doing '(you go')
But for your buttocks I love seeing you (huh, eh)
Uah, uah, baby
[Verse 1: Darell]
The Real Rondón
With that guy you always' go sad, sad (that's it, that's how, like that)
I don't know what you wrapped yourself (-You came out; what knows')
You fell in love and took it to a joke (ey), you have no
That damage, ma ', you did it (ra-ta-ta-tá!)
I am always waiting for you (how long?)
I don't know what you are 'thinking (that is so; thinking)
Return, that the time 'will pass
Time is running out
But, then, then 'go flying (flying)
You do not deserve 'that they fail you (that is like that)
He does not do it as me and that e 'the detail (pa' who knows')
Tell me that you want 'that guaya (by law)
Calla'o, that nobody finds out
You don't know 'how much I adore you (hah-hah)
You ere 'my princess, mommy, you ere' my treasure
If he doesn't value you, mommy, Pue ', I value you
Because I always want to find the four hand '' and gold

[Verse 2: Anuel AA]
(Real until death, baby)
Your devil
You ere 'my kilo and I am your Pablo (Pablo)
And you get wet 'when I speak to you (I speak to you)
And I put you in four, OH-OH, OH-OH-OH
MY DEMONIA (UAH)
Can you 'or do you'? You 'erroneous (eh-eh-eh)
Diabolical, wears black, Gothic, uah, uah
A devil in woman (in woman)
And I lambe to 'lo' tattoo 'in my skin (skin)
Drinking codeine (codeine)
And your buttock 'are my heroine, uah
Baby, you ere 'a devil (huh, h)
And you have 'face that you like being unfaithful (uah)
And I love you in my bed (huh, eh)

[Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
(N-I-C-K)
Mommy, don't leave me alone
'Toy addicted with that body of Colombia
That booty gives dementia, you ere 'bad influence
Why did they make you my preference? (Hey)
I send your surgeon greeting '
It does not fail, when I undressed you, I was silent
Of those who threw you 'I was the only one who could
Say that I am the one who gives you often
I love it when you vent on me dancing
How do you look at me when I'm giving you (giving)

[Verse 4: Brytiago, Brytiago & Nicky Jam]
(Brytiago, Baby)
I love that 'buttock', I confess it
Thanks to Dio 'that what I think (Nope) is not heard
With me and 'a passage without return
And I'm going to kidnap you, even if tomorrow he falls prisoner
And send it to fly
E 'a moron who did not know how to value you
Don't say no, because it can juque you
What I have here has' to try, Yeh-eh (Wuh)
He speaks a lot and doesn't know how to get wet
There is' lack of affection, I know only to look at you
What needs 'e' a man who knows how to touch you (aha)
I do not border on, I let the AP highlight (UH-WUH)
With me he doesn't have to lie
In bed you don't have to pretend you're fine
Do not take 'fight with the type
If you fight, send it to the fuck and tell me that you are doing '
[Chorus: Nicky Jam & Anuel AA]
Because he doesn't make you smile (-Reir)
Baby, I hate when you are doing '(you go')
But for your buttock I love seeing you (-te ír; uah, uah)
My devil, today with me you are doing '(uah)
Because he doesn't even come to you (come)
Baby, I hate when you are doing '(you go')
But for your buttocks I love seeing you (huh, eh)
Uah, uah, baby
