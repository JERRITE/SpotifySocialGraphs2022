Iâ€™m Leaving You Again Lyrics[Chorus: New Edition]
Girl, I'm leaving you again
And I thought I'd tell you when
I know how you must feel
But if your love's for real
You'd try to understand
That I'm in popular demand

[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
When we first met
I told you how it would be
And you said you understood
And that you'd still keep loving me
Now it seems you're changing your mind
Each and every time
Girl, one day, leave with me
You just wait and see
But as of today, it has to be this way
Oh, oh, whoa
[Chorus: New Edition]
Girl, I'm leaving you again
And I thought I'd tell you when
I know how you must feel
But if your love's for real
You'd try to understand
That I'm in popular demand

[Verse 2: Ralph Tresvant]
And girl I wish
That there was a way
For you and I to stay together forever and a day
Girl, I would give you all of my love
And place no one above
And girl, one day, leave with me
You just wait and see
But as of today, it has to be this way
Oh, oh, whoa

[Chorus: New Edition]
Girl, I'm leaving you again
And I thought I'd tell you when
I know how you must feel
But if your love's for real
You'd try to understand
That I'm in popular demand

Oh, girl, please tell me
Is there a way
For you and I to stay together
Forever and a day
Oh, oh, oh
Please tell me
Will you still love me?
Regardless to the way I leave
'Cause that's the way it has to be

[Outro: New Edition, Ricky Bell]
Shoop shoop shoo bop (Girl, I'm leaving)
Means I'm never gonna give you up
Shoop shoop shoo bop
Means I'm never gonna give you up
Shoop shoop shoo bop (Girl, I'm leaving)
Means I'm never gonna give you up
Shoop shoop shoo bop
Means I'm never gonna give you up
Shoop shoop shoo bop (Girl, I'm leaving)
Means I'm never gonna give you up
Shoop shoop shoo bop
Means I'm never gonna give you upEmbed
