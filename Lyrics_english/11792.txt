From afar Lyricspido few things, I ask your memory
That you remind me in a good way
When my calendar days pass
I'm discovering that I loved you so much
So much so that the bad times do not weigh
VERY OUT
Everything is paid
And if I ask me I already did the passes
No regrets

That there is light in your life I want
Make you happy I intend
Sit down and look from afar that if they name me
Don't look at the sky
And keep me in that corner where you keep
The things that were your dreams
I walk slowly chewing time
And I remember you in a good way
There will be days soon will be years
And I discover that I loved you so much
So much and yet I had my mistakes
I know that some success is no longer necessary
Everything is paid and if you ask me
I already made the passes without regrets

That there is light in your life I want
Make you happy I intend
Sit down and look from afar that if they name me
Don't look at the sky
And keep me in that corner where you keep
The things that were your dreams
The things that were your dreams

Sit down and look from afar that if they name me
Don't look at the sky
And keep me in that corner where you keep
The things that were your dreams

You smiled at me and so from afar I can see that we close the story
And that you keep me in that rin with where you keep the things that were your dreamsyou might Also Likeembed
