Out of Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lovers into friends
Move on to strangers
Let go, no more us
Move on, I'm tryin'
Denyin', sayin' time will heal
Keep lyin' to make me feel
I'm okay, so you believe
I'll forget you, seriously?
Really? Are you kidding me?
[Chorus]
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mine

[Verse 2]
Happy, used to be
Together, you and me
Things die, drift apart
Wait for a new start
Denyin', think you'll fade away
Keep lyin', I can hear you say
You're in touch with reality
And, baby, I'd say, "Are you kidding me?"

[Chorus]
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mine

[Bridge]
How can you say I'll be alright?
What makes you think that I'll be fine?
Baby, you have to be completely out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I could keep you out of mine
You're out of your
You might also like[Chorus]
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mine

[Outro]
You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I, to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mine8Embed
