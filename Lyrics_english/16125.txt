Liège Lyrics cork [Words of "Bouchon de Liège"]

[Intro]
I am at the start of the Ariane rocket (back to the future)
It is surprised big buffoon
I give Marianne's big ass the big ass
That's why it smells like bacon
I put it deep, I have speleo
I open my throat like a tracheo
A facial I do the decor
Your blood in the grail is for the aperitif
[Verse 1]
Hey, wake up, I do the best CDs
If I want I am daddy, mom, silent, I do not await the baby
We drink you, we bottle you
If I love you like Chris Brown
I tear her face like a piranha
You come back every time like Rihanna
Mc You don't seem to me if Auch ', you have a funny gesture
The Sheitan that you do on your left must be homosexual
I'm going to haggard like a tyrant, I get power as in Iran
Can you call me the shah, I can put you in the pussy?
[Chorus]
We take you like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Or I fart like the cork cap
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork
You might also like [verse 2]
You have to feel the real amount, or I get the rectum
On your chicots I cum, like vademecum
I want coke and I want Cali, Roro, I'm on board the rally
Negro I am there for the Khalis, 'Koro like northern Mali
I'm sitting on the handlebars, essential like starch
I don't care if you're not bintou, I'm fucking even if you're guindu
In condemn condemned, we have the flair, we have the nose
Twenty thousand leagues all year round, my cock in your ass made apnea
I put a wind tah the mistral, the punch is masterful
Each of my freestyles reveals the 7 crystal balls
We do not play mandolin, I have the sword of the Praetorian guard
I smoke as in Medellín and I wander two, three Mongolian women

[Chorus]
We take you like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Or I fart like the cork cap
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork
[Verse 3]
9 milli-milli, not come to make Guili-Guili
I am a grizzilizi in all sauces like pili-pili
Blood flows, it's not ketchup heinz, like 2 chainz, I came to make billions
Merco Benz, butterfly opening, armed with hatred, I'm on the pavilion
Avoid turning your jacket, I don't really like the big gestures
On the other hand to make me ler-bran like, three points #LEBRONJAMES
You can only heckle, the gun pass you the S.A.L.U.T
Nothing ne-rien is used to fight, big feat 'with the trawler
I eat the Schneck like a Viennese, at the same time I am binting my O.G. Kush
At the same time I grab a big fly with a pair of Chinese baguettes
We take you like the cork cork, put your skiing there is snow
Two, three rounds of merry -go -round, you will remember like a virgin

[Chorus]
We take you like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
Fart like a cork cork
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
2.7.0.93, 2.7.0.93
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Put me my consumption in a large bucket
Or I fart like the cork cap
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork
Fart like the cork cork

[Outro]
The king
The mayors of the unite
Yeah yeah
Fart like the cork cork
