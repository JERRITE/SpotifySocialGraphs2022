Catching the Butterfly Lyrics[Verse 1]
So you born
And so you thought
The future's ours
To keep and hold
Oh, child within
Has healing ways
It sees it through
My darkest days

[Chorus]
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine
[Post-Chorus]
In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

[Verse 2]
Something learned through life, no fun
I want to feel, I want to run

[Chorus]
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine

[Post-Chorus]
In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine
Keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine
I'm goin' to keep catching that butterfly in that dream of mine

[Post-Chorus]
In my darkest dream
In my darkest dream
In my darkest dream
In my darkest dream
