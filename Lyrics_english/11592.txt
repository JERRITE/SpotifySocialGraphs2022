Your Dog Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be your little pet
At the edge of every bed
You sleep in, body stretching out
Guess I'll curl up on the couch
[Chorus]
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you

[Verse 3]
'Cause I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

[Chorus]
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you

[Verse 4]
'Cause I don't wanna be your baby girl
That you show off to the world and
When you decide you wanna feel
Like you're living something real

[Verse 5]
I'm not a prop for you to use
When you're lonely or confused
I want a love that lets me breathe
I've been choking on your leashYou might also like10Embed
