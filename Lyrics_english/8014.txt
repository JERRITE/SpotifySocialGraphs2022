Stay Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why should we take it slow
When it feels like gold with you?
Can't see the end of the show
The part when I'm growing old with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We made it through some highs and lows
Nothing that I'd undo, I wear it like a tattoo
Feels so right, it could go wrong
Is it too good to be true?
[Chorus]
As time goes by will you love me, will you love me?
Say it, say it, say you'll still be mine
Baby hold me, say I'm the only
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

[Drop]
Ahh, ahh
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel afraid, wonder if you feel the same do you?
When you'll go, I can't wait
To have you back in my arms
Like we're back at the start

[Pre-Chorus]
We made it through some highs and lows
Nothing that I'd undo, I wear it like a tattoo
Feels so right, it could go wrong
Is it too good to be true?

[Chorus]
As time goes by will you love me, will you love me?
Say it, say it, say you'll still be mine
Baby hold me, say I'm the only
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

Ahh, ahh
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine
Ahh, ahh
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

[Bridge]
I don't wanna lose this high
I found mine some state of mind
And when it's past forever
You stay mine

[Chorus]
As time goes by will you love me, will you love me?
Say it, say it, say you'll still be mine
Baby hold me, say I'm the only
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine

[Drop]
Say it, say it, say you'll still be mine
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
And when it's past forever, you'll stay mine1Embed
