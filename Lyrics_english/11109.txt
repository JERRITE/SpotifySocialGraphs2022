​ooh la la Lyrics[Intro: El-P]
Uh, hey (Oh, shit)

[Chorus: Greg Nice & El-P]
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Let's go)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la
[Verse 1: El-P]
Lookin' for M's like I lost a friend
Jump out of my bed like, "Where the bread?"
You gon' hold the egg, waiter bring the check
When we talk, we Kalashnikov, keep us in your thoughts
Fully dressed at the crack of dawn, weapons letting off
I can hear them from the block, see them creeping through the fog
Season's greetings, now feeding season can start, oh my God
Look alive, lookin' like I live life on a crooked line
Doin' fine, you want maximum stupid, I am the guy

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
First of all, fuck the fuckin' law, we is fuckin' raw
Steak tartare, oysters on the half-shell, sushi bar
Life a bitch and the pussy fish, still fucked her raw
I'm a dog, I'm a dirty dog, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ol' Dirty Bastard, go in your jaw, shimmy shimmy ya
Got the semi in the hemi, goin' "Gimme, gimme, y'all"
Pugilistic, my linguistics are Jeru the Damaja
And I rap it pornographic, bitch, set up the camera

[Chorus: Greg Nice, El-P & Killer Mike]
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ah, oui oui)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (I need a bottle of Moët, ho, come on)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Garçon)

You covet disruption, I got you covered, I'm bussin' (Bussin')
My brother's a runner, he's crushin', it's no discussion ('Scussion)
I used to be munchkin, I wasn't 'posed to be nothin' (Nothin')
Y'all fuckers corrupted and up to somethin' disgusting
My pockets are plumper this season, I love to cuff 'em
I'm afraid of nothin' but nothingness, ain't it something?
Warmongers are dumpin', they'll point and click at your pumpkin (Look out)
Your suffering is scrumptious, they'll put your kids in the oven

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Fuck a king or queen and all of they loyal subjects
I pull my penis out and I piss on they shoes in public
People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic
No matter what you order, muhfucker, we what you're stuck with (Sorry)
I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca
Helped me understand I'm probably more of a Joker
When we usher in chaos, just know that we did it smiling
Cannibals on this island, inmates run the asylum

[Chorus: Greg Nice & El-P]
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la (DJ Premier)

Ooh, ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ah, oui, ah, oui, ah
Ah, ah, oui, oui11Embed
