SELF-SABOTAGE (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Joel Madden and Awsten Knight]
"I don't know what this is but..."
*Awsten laughs*
"Hey guys, just me and Awsten here."

[Verse 1: Awsten Knight]
When we talk, I'm never wrong
And if we don't fight, it won't last long
Might unplug my phone at night
And when you need me most, I'll miss that flight
[Pre-Chorus: Awsten Knight]
Cause It's avoidable, I'll destroy chances to be
Better than I was before you and me
Now we're at the part where you'll hate what you see
What the fuck is wrong with me?

[Chorus: Awsten Knight]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Awsten Knight]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Joel Madden]
It's sad
So sad, we both know it
Every time I find a good thing, yeah, I throw it
All the way over the edge, and I stay stoic
I get the chance to change your mind, still I blow it

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Madden]
You see, I don't really battle
You need in me in your rain
I'm Nirvana, singing "na na, na na" through the pain
Eddie Vedder sang it better
When he said he hated me
What the fuck is wrong with me?
You might also like[Chorus: Joel Madden, Both]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Awsten Knight & Joel Madden]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Awsten Knight]
I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage
So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh
To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage
If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Awsten Knight & Joel Madden]
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)
What the fuck is wrong with me?Embed
