TranslationishishThe Game - Talk to Me Nice ft. Meek Mill, Moneybagg Yo & Blxst (Portuguese) Lyrics.

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly, uh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I am being sucked in my lumbo (Lambo)
Many weapons in my pack (yes)
All we talk about is that drug chat (drug chat)
My Man Kyrie with the handles (SKRRT, SKRRT)
Everyone bursting this cool shit (legal shit)
Until we even blow your candles (BRR)
Young black man bursting this great shit (big shit)
And I am tied like a sandal, Woah, wait (Shee)
Chanel in my bitch
Needless to say, I am rich
Speaking bullshit, we killed your partner, A .40 starts to bark and make him become a victim
Giro in the rivals, we will kill the chеfe, I called е they are coming to beat
Waisting as if we never heard about the law, something about myself, I will never explain, huh
Were you just talking about justice reform, what the fuck are you doing? Aw, my
I've been selling drugs all week, wearing popcorn and selling hard tan (yes)
Gata wants to see Netflix and relax, I really don't want to kick, van damme (yes)
I'm the type who fucks a bad slut on the first night, then kick the bitch out like pam
[Chorus: BLXST]
Hey Hey)
I'm very head to follow your advice, so talk to me kindly
I can turn the sofa into designer and fuck your whites, we do what we like (yes)
So bad slut, you can explode bags, yes, to fuck her life (fucking her life)
Diamonds, they came with a birth certificate, it is not overnight
Fifty package, all blue face
It comes in some ways, yes, yes
I go crazy, if I say myself
This is my new mine, it goes both ways, well, well
I go crazy, if I say myself

[Verse 2: The Game]
Where are the steppers? (Where are the steppers?)
I came to step on shit (stepping on shit)
Where are the weapons? (Where are the weapons?)
I'm in my fuck FN (shit fn)
I've had a fifty comb
He was not in my second shit
This album has Kanye in it, starting to look like a will
I play money bags for them, that's why my section is on
And you can tell which of these whores just paid me blowjob, she sucking mint bullets
Grammy nominated, forty million records sold, that's not what a legend is
Draco is camouflaged because inside the fendi is leopard print
Do these snails still smoke chronic? PSH, I have a bitch in the Netherlands, all out of the element
I took her to Dr. Miami and now she looks better than Evelyn
She also has a Draco, swinging like the trunk of an elephant
I had sex with her on the second day, hot sauce in the condom, we are killing the evidence
They are killing the Rap Manos, I'm losing competitors
I stop in a red rolls-royce, stop giving flowers to the brothers that I am better
Me against everyone, bro, is what I said is
And you know that I am related to gangs, let us enter, I came with my relatives
It's tonight-
You might also like [chorus: blxst]
Hey Hey)
I'm very head to follow your advice, so talk to me kindly
I can turn the sofa into designer and fuck your whites, we do what we like (yes)
So bad slut, you can explode bags, yes, to fuck her life (fucking her life)
Diamonds, they came with a birth certificate, it is not overnight
Fifty package, all blue face
It comes in some ways, yes, yes
I go crazy, if I say myself
This is my new mine, it goes both ways, well, well
I go crazy, if I say myself

[Verse 3: Moneybagg Yo]
Talk to me kindly, little bitch
I'm loaded, don't ask for the price of this shit (don't do it)
Much player, is in me, not in me, I will hit a bitch with a Nike adjustment (yes, yes)
I put it for my partners, I am real as possible
Before I bought the drink, I kissed
I had to make sure it is right (MWAH)
They try to say that we are bipolar (why?), Me and this Glock we have a switch
Fifty and few notes for a six -hour flight
Just to go back, I'll be back tonight
Talk to me kindly, you can't meet twice (Nah)
Fuck all these blogs trying to use me through hype (bitch)
In the pack without lights where you find us (I've been selling drugs)
We were just smaller (at that time)
Money in front of me, bullshit behind us (focus)
We just vibrate, don't care about us (yes, yes)
Lamborghini Urus Bloody
She was cleaning while I was driving
Air pistol, I'm insured
I won't let you get me out of my children
Helicopters, BRR, BRR
VVs are relaxing, burr
Without cut, everything I drink is pure
Flight before boarding Lear (Big Bagg)
[Chorus: BLXST]
Hey Hey)
I'm very head to follow your advice, so talk to me kindly
I can turn the sofa into designer and fuck your whites, we do what we like (yes)
So bad slut, you can explode bags, yes, to fuck her life (fucking her life)
Diamonds, they came with a birth certificate, it is not overnight
Fifty package, all blue face
It comes in some ways, yes, yes
I go crazy, if I say myself
This is my new mine, it goes both ways, well, well
I go crazy, if I di --mbed
