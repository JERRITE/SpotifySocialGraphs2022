Foreplay / Long Time Lyrics[Part I: Foreplay]

[Instrumental]

[Part II: Long Time]

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'
[Bridge 1]
Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say

[Chorus]
Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

[Post-Chorus]
Ah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
Hey

[Verse 2]
Well I get so lonely
When I am without you-ooo
But in my mind, deep in my mind
I can't forget about you, ohh

[Bridge 2]
Now good times
And faces that remind me, yeah
I'm tryin' to forget your name
And leave it all behind me
You're comin' back to find me

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah, hey
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time

There's a long road
I've gotta stay in time with, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream
Though I may never find it
I'm always just behind it, oo ooo

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
Takin' my time, oh, just movin' along
Takin' my time, ohh, I'm takin' my time

Takin' my time (takin' my time)
Takin' my time (oh just takin' my time)
Takin' my time (just outside-a your front door)
