Touch yourself Lyrics [letter of "Take yourself" ft. Bad Bunny]

[Pre-car: Fido]
Tell me what are you going to do now
That he has 'desire, but he is' alone
If you despair you call me the cell (Yeh-Yeh, EH, EH-EH)
So that I tell you what you have to do

[Chorus: Fido, Alexis]
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me (Bad Bunny, my g)
[Verse 1: bad bunny]
I want you to touch and imagine
I am in your bed and with you I came
Like that night I put you after we went to the movies
Put on the Victoria Violeta Pa 'that with Haze's bow combines them
And that you smoke it for me alucine '
A thousand bastards throw him, but I am the only one who puts it
Inside 'e la portfolio toys and condone'
More poses is known than Esperanza GÃ³mez
Snapchats without clothes listening to my song '
Crazy that I get to pr pa 'that corone
I also get bad thinking about you (thinking about you)
You are my baby, the one that I left (I left)
Quiet, ma ', I'm going there (Yeh)
But for the moment

[Chorus: Fido]
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me

Hello, prepare that the show is going to start
Lower the lights to the minimum
Stop something and turn off the dembow
Put it in Speaker and listen only to my voice
I'm going to penetrate you with my voice
I'm going to make you hot so much that I'm going to make you come with my voice
Love your hair, take off your clothes, get your lips (oh, yeah)
Lie on the floor, give yourself another cup, raise the radio (OH, Yeah)
Put one hand in the neck and the other let her caress you for all your part '
I want you to take sexual toys and start punishing you
As well as if I were giving you, mistreating, pleased
On my cell phone recording you
I hope to be exciting you
I don't want you to stop until you inspire you (Wuh)
Imagine that in your hand I came
Wants me to ask you, that in the mirror I look at you
And let yourself go until you just eliminate

[Pre-car: Fido]
Tell me what are you going to do now
That he has' desire, but he is alone
If you despair you call me the cell
So that I tell you what you have to do
[Chorus: Fido]
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me
Touch yourself
Think about how I gave you
How I climbed to you 'on top
In the mirror you looked at me
