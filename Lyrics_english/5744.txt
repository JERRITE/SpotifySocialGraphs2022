Diamond in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1: LIZ]
I've been tryin', tryin'
Tryin' to light you up
You're hardened, hardened
Soften up with my touch

[Pre-Chorus: LIZ]
And I'm not gonna apologize for lovin' hard
I never try to hide my glittering heart
I'm proud of where I've been
So, I bedazzle all my scars
I don't wanna lose that, lose that (Oooh)
Don't wanna lose that, lose that (Oooh)
[Chorus: LIZ]
Look up, look up, look up, baby
Rhinestones in the night sky
They shine, yeah, they shine for us, baby
Boy, you'll never know, gotta let it glow
Look up, look up, look up, baby
Rhinestones in the night sky
In a flash, it's all gone, it's gone, baby
Diamond in the dark
I'm a shooting star

[Hook: LIZ]
Diamond in the dark
I don't wanna lose that, lose that
I'm a diamond in the dark
Diamond in the dark
I don't wanna lose that, lose that
I'm a diamond in the dark

[Verse 2: Slayyyter]
Gimme a call late at night
Make out in your car in the velvet twilight
Got my heart burnin' bright
Body lightin' up like the Northern Lights
You say that I sparkle in a way you've never seen
Come and touch me, boy
I can give you everything
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: LIZ & Slayyyter]
And I'm not gonna apologize for lovinn' hard
I never try to hide my glittering heart
I'm proud of where I've been
So, I bedazzle all my scars
I don't wanna lose that, lose that (Oooh)
I don't wanna lose that, lose that (Oooh)

[Chorus: LIZ, Slayyyter & LIZ & Slayyyter]
Look up, look up, look up, baby
Rhinestones in the night sky
They shine, yeah they shine for us, baby
Boy, you'll never know, gotta let it glow
Look up, look up, look up, baby
Rhinestones in the night sky
In a flash, it's all gone, it's gone, baby
Diamond in the dark, I'm a shooting star

[Hook: LIZ & LIZ & Slayyyter]
Diamond in the dark
I don't wanna lose that, lose that
I'm a diamond in the dark
Diamond in the dark
I don't wanna lose that, lose that
I'm a diamond in the dark2Embed
