Pégate Lyrics (Tito)
Now I have to tell you what I feel ...
Now I have to tell you what I want
Woman...
Kiss Me
Touch me
Caressed me
And feel me again
Woman ... (2)

D ... J ... nel ... are ...
Stop when you listen to the bambines
Get out, and if your body asks you
Surrend me and once
Pégate, Surrend me, excite me (2)

(Hector)
I'm going hunting, come on, actívensen, I'm the fox
And if I run them to look at Pa’l Morro
Don't be dramatic, come and perrea
And feel the echo
Because so plastic if you have run more than pecos, mai
Bring the action
I want you to go down
And what lace
Let's go wild
With the bambino that reaches you
I WANT TO SEE YOUR MOVEMENT THAT I TAKE YOU
And here I'm sorry
Nelson!
Put this slower

Your upset Pai, I don't protest, I'm honest
Do not make the crazy one you know about this
What you like is
SEX
What you like is
SEX
And I don't know if you dance well
I don't know if you kiss well
What I want is to see without clothes
And I just met her
Nor his name I know
What I want is to see without clothes (2)

Stop when you listen to the bambines
Get out, and if your body asks you
Surrend me and once
Pégate, Surrend me, excite me (2) embed
