Out Like a Light 2 Lyrics[Chorus]
Take me uptight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
And if I betrayed our lonely nights
Spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we never fight when I'm away?

[Spoken: Ricky's aunt (Mary Lou), Ricky's uncle Dennis]
A very beautiful dignified lady
I was small, y'know, so old
And I always admired her fingernails they were blood-red
She always had them painted beautifully
And she was- and her hair was coal black and beautiful
She was graceful
And she, she had anything a woman could want
A good husband and money and a nice home
But she met this jailbird and they married
And so she gave all that up and found out that she wasn't happy
She was packing to leave and he got out of jail and came home and found her and hacked her to death
Oh honey, that's awful!
[Verse]
Did your mother always seem to hate me?
I'm sicker every day and now I'm terrified of talking to my friends only to stay stuck
Dreaming of our first born and your hair covered in popcorn
You never leave, you never leave, you never leave

[Chorus]
You leave me uptight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
And if I betrayed our lonely nights
Spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we never fight when I'm away?You might also like3Embed
