Teenager in Love Lyrics[Intro]
You make me feel like a teenager in love
You make me feel like a teenager in love

[Verse 1]
You call me queen
You're in ripped jeans
And you just pulled up to a love song
Hearts in my eyes
Strawberry skies
Beat up Corvettes smelling of cigarettes
But time keeps on slippin'
[Chorus]
You make me feel like a teenager in love
And you make me feel like I'll be forever young
And I don't want no, nobody else
I don't want no, nobody else
You make me feel like a teenager in love
So don't let me down
(You make me feel like a teenager in love)
Don't, don't let me down
(You make me feel like a teenager in love)

[Verse 2]
Talk of the town
Bought me a gown
Told me you'd swoop me past midnight
I had a dream
You weren't so mean
But I like you better when you get angry
But time keeps on slippin'

[Chorus]
You make me feel like a teenager in love
And you make me feel like I'll be forever young
And I don't want no, nobody else
I don't want no, nobody else
You make me feel like a teenager in love
So don't let me down
You might also like[Bridge]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
When you come around
You come around
You come around
I'm always singin'
Time keeps on slippin', oh

[Chorus]
You make me feel like a teenager in love
And you make me feel like I'll be forever young
You make me feel like a teenager in love
And you make me feel like I'll be forever young
And I don't want no, nobody else
I don't want no, nobody else
You make me feel like a teenager in love
So don't let me down
(You make me feel like a teenager in love)
Don't, don't let me down
(You make me feel like a teenager in love)
So don't let me down8Embed
