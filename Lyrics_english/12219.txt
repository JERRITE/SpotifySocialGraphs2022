Lowlife Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
Old suitcase, clean getaway
I'm the one who takes the blame again
New day but the same lines
I feel like a victim of the dollar sign

[Pre-Chorus]
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
'Til you came, don't you know?
Don't you know?
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, ayy (Lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah, alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
(Lowlife, lowlife)

[Verse 2]
This bad taste, these headaches
Wake up on the floor again, ah, yeah
My torn dress, this failed test
Soon they will be erased

[Pre-Chorus]
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
'Til you came, don't you know?
Don't you know?

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, ayy (Lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah, alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife

And I get so lonely
I can't make it on my own
And I need to call ya
Can you come to my chateau?
Take me in your arms and
Hold me tight, yeah, pull me close
Whisper in my ear
All I want you to say is

[Chorus]
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, ayy (Lowlife, lowlife)
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah, alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, ayy
Take a shitty day and make it alright, yeah, alright
Oh, in every circumstance
Yeah, you make the difference
Baby, you're the highlight of my lowlife, lowlife32Embed
