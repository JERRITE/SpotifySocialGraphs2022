Saigon Lyrics ["Saigon" text]

[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
It always ends up bad when it starts well
It always ends badly when it starts, babe
Tequila, lemon and salt when I start drinking
I can't cool the blood in the veins
I don't know if I made a nightmare or a dream (Yeah-Yeah)
You are alone when you get higher than the day (Yeah-Yeah)
You are alone if you go further than the night (Yeah-Yeah)
You are with him, but think of me, I hope times (uoh)
To give me back time time is not enough for me a rolex (one)
To love you as you want me, a heart is not enough for me (one)
To touch you, two hands are not enough for me (ah-ah)
In Amor wins those who flee, I am flying to Miami (haha)
If everything is fake around (hey), don't save you a filter (Nah)
Pastel colors, yes, pastening to Ginto '(Yeah)
I would just like something true (true)
Maybe you weren't mine even when I squeezed you
[Pre-Crs 1]
I waited for a while, though (though)
Now I count up to one hundred (one hundred)
Our time has expired (time)

[Refrain]
Saigon (Saigon) will bloom cherries
While we are getting lost
We were born already crying
Days they burn in the fire and then (and then)
It remains a little nostalgia
How true is a lie?

[Verse 2]
For you I would have only come out on the weekend (Yeah-Yeah)
For you I would also have come out of the gangs (Yeah-Yeah)
For you I would speak forbit without slang (yeah-yeah)
But I split too much, you know, to be innocent (ah)
And you who are a one million girl up
I do not mean likes and views, I hang on you, Gu√®sus (uh)
My life is a movie that has never come out (never)
I do it my way, my way like Carlito (never)
Here are all fake good, all fake good (ah-ah)
Fake rich, fake beautiful, you know you don't save you (nah)
And of this city they gave me the keys (clear)
You Might Also Like [Pre-Rornello 2]
But you know I don't give a damn
Nothing more
I repeat it, but it serves nothing
Nothing you
You think then you call you (Yeah)
Tattoo on the hands (Yeah)
They will make other hands (Yeah)
Nothing more

[Refrain]
Saigon (Saigon) will bloom cherries
While we are getting lost
We were born already crying
Days they burn in the fire and then (and then)
It remains a little nostalgia
How true is a lie?

[Post-riernello]
Saigon (Saigon) will bloom cherries
While we are getting lost
We were born already crying
Days they burn in the fire and then (and then)
It remains a little nostalgia
How true is a lie?
[Outro]
They will bloom, they will bloom
While we are getting lost
Our time has expired
Days they burn, days they burn
It remains a little nostalgia
How true is a lie? Embed
