This heart Lyrics [verse 1: Christopher, Dulce & both]
How can you recover your love?
How to get the sadness from my heart?
My world spins because of you
How to heal this deep pain?
I am sorry to run through my veins, your breathing
I'm so connected to you
That even in my dreams I see you, without you I die

[Chorus: RBD]
And this heart that you stole
When you left
You left with my kisses
With my kisses and my dreams
And this heart is beating
Increasingly
And I'm feeling in my deep
How the fire did not go out
[Post-car: RBD]
It did not go out

[Verse 2: Alfonso, Anahí & both]
How to calm this deep obsession?
How do I explain to my soul that it ended?
I am going crazy for you
Even in my dreams I see you, without you I die

[Chorus: RBD]
And this heart that you stole
When you left
You left with my kisses
With my kisses and my dreams
And this heart is beating
Increasingly
And I'm feeling in my deep
How the fire did not go out

[Bridge: RBD & Anahí]
Keep burning (keep burning)
While love exists
Love did not go out, uoh, uoh
And this heart

[Chorus: RBD & Anahí]
And this heart that you stole
When you left
You left with my kisses
With my kisses and my dreams
And this heart (heart) is beating
Increasingly slow (beating)
And I'm feeling in my deep
How the fire did not go out Might Also Likeembed
