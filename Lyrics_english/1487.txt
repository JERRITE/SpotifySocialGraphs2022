TranslationsPortuguêsDeutschHappy For You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once you left, I went to space
I don't recognize this place
Where are you?
Where are you?
Now I miss the smallest things
I'm not ready for this change
Where are you?
Where are you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but wonder
[Chorus]
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready now?
Do you forgive me? Am I something you can talk about?
I heard you're moving on and now you got it figured out
Well, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Are you really gonna tell me that you'rе better now?
Hey, ain't it funny how wе swore we couldn't live without each other?
Now you got another, got it figured out
Well, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Happy for you
Just wanna be happy, too

[Verse 2]
Love you, hate you, all the same
Either way, it takes up space
I had you
I had you
Haunted by the ghost of us
Sorry, now I've said too much
I had to
I had you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help but wonder

[Chorus]
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready now?
Do you forgive me? Am I something you can talk about?
I heard you're moving on and now you got it figured out
Well, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Are you really gonna tell me that you're better now?
Hey, ain't it funny how we swore we couldn't live without each other?
Now you got another, got it figured out
Well, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Happy for you
Just wanna be happy, too

I've lived with all this long enough, long enough
Don't you still wonder if it could have been us?

[Chorus]
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready now?
Do you forgive me? Am I something you can talk about?
I heard you're moving on and now you got it figured out
I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Are you really gonna tell me that you're better now?
Hey, ain't it funny how we swore we couldn't live without each other?
Now you got another, got it figured out
Well, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
Happy for you
Just wanna be happy, too1Embed
