Your tears Lyrics [lyrics of "your tears"]

[Intro: sech]
Uh uh uh

[Pre-Caro: Mora & Sech]
You want with me, but your heart owns
That is no longer useful, take it to a pawn house (Yeah)
And if you don't know 'forget, calm, I teach you (teach)
I try not to think, but I get 'even in the dream' (Yeah)
[Chorus: Sech & Mora]
I follow you the machine
I know what he thinks' about him
But that bastard does not deserve your tear '
Just leave him, I do the Demá '
Baby, pass the page (UH-UH)
You don't know about him, yesterday
Tell him that he has someone more '
That makes it better and does not fight for na '(rra!)

[Verse 1: sech]
Baby, yo 'toy pa' you, but tell me
If you want to advance, change me the lu '
The coffin door give it open
That this relationship is already dead (Wuh)
He says he loves you and looks at her attitude
Baby, you stand out 'between the crowd
You are not common, you ere 'another return
Ask for a pure 'thing' rich ', mommy, it is composed
The night lends itself, I don't want indirect '
I wanted to tie you but you walk
And before you go ', mommy, put the webcam
Take off your clothes to see you complete
You are crazy, ma ', but I am the same
That bastard subtracts you, I add you to add
Because you are face like an audmars
With the blue background, equal to the sea

[Verse 2: Mora]
Baby, calm, don't cry for him, I can be your cloth
Basamo 'to be strange' to throw 'three dust' in the same bathroom
And you know that if I touch you a puddle forms
I buy you the whole world, I empty the bank
I take out the G-Wagon, a blank seat
Maybe he 'different, but I adapt
Baby, don't give you 'bad life
Of that depression I am the only way out
When I put it to you you feel alive
Block that bastard for you don't even write to you4embed
