Annabelle Lyrics [text by "Annabelle"]

[Intro]
Stay with feet on the ground, hey
And to do content who you loved, hey
You know, it takes half second
But I'm evil like Annabelle

[Refrain]
Yah, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, wo-oh-oh, hey
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, wo-oh-oh, hey
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, Uh
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, wo-oh-oh, hey
[Verse]
I can't stand you, no, no, no-noia
I don't support you, no, you are a boredom
Testa travel in the Mood of Povia
Miss the appeal but it is not noticeable
They write in small, say that it does not swim there
Alley, I tell you that in fact there are those who fly
Only the strong win and whoever clashes
He says "no" and takes his crown
Yah, Yah, Yah, Yah
Brother, it's all a Bla-Bla-Bla-Bla-Bla
A brothel, I do Ble-Ben-can be-tabless
Sure not, I don't do ma-but-but-macello, hey

[Bridge]
Stay with feet on the ground, hey
And to do content who you loved, hey
You know, it takes half second
But I'm evil like Annabelle

[Refrain]
Yah, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, wo-oh-oh, hey
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Anabelle, Yah, wo-oh-oh, hey
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, Uh
Annabelle, Yah, Annabelle, Annabelle, Yah
Annabelle, Yah, Wo-Oh-Oh, Ehiyou Might Also Likeembed
