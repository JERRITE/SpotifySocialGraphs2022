Windows Are Rolled Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look up child
The world is born
Shoe's untied
And your soles are worn

[Chorus]
Windows are rolled down
Sun is setting high
Windows are rolled down
I'm fixin' to die
[Verse 2]
Corn rows have companion feel
This rocky road and this steering wheel
Who do you call to ease your pain?
I hope for you to get through this rain

[Chorus]
Windows are rolled down
Moon is hanging low
Windows are rolled down
Think it's time for me to go hey-ay-ay-a............-ay

[Verse 3]
Is it what you dreamed it'd be?
Are you locked up in this fantasy?
Oh this miles that have
Torn us apart
My new found faith
And my broken heart

[Chorus]
Windows are rolled down
Sun is rising high
Windows are rolled down
Feel that wind rushing by hey-ay-ay-a.......
