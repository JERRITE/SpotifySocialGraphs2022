Somebodyâ€™s Gonna Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
She dyed her hair blue
She's going through a mid-life crisis at twenty-two
She thinks she's so cool
Well I hate to admit it
But I think she knows
I think she is too

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't want another boy like me
Another L.O.S.E.R who thinks he can sing
Baby, let me be your Nirvana in the 90's
[Chorus]
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna take your broken heart and make it brand new
Somebody's gonna love you
Take all of the dark, turn it to light and paint your sky blue

Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you, love you

[Verse 2]
She told me goodbye
Thank you for playing the game babe
You made a nice try
Won't be the last time
Somebody's losing sleep over that smile
And those beautiful eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't want another boy like me
Another L.O.S.E.R who thinks he can sing
Baby, let me be your Nirvana in the 90's

[Cborus]
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna take your broken heart and make it brand new
Somebody's gonna love you
Take all of the dark, turn it to light and paint your sky blue
You might also likeSomebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you, love you

[Interlude/Bridge]
She doesn't want another boy like me
Another L.O.S.E.R who thinks he can sing
Baby, let me be your Nirvana in the 90's

[Chorus]
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna take your broken heart and make it brand new
Somebody's gonna love you
Take all of the dark, turn it to light and paint your sky blue

Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna take your broken heart and make it brand new
Somebody's gonna love you
Take all of the dark, turn it to light and paint your sky blue

Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you
Somebody's gonna love you, love youEmbed
