​dark days in høllywøød Lyrics[Verse 1: Le Play & cøzybøy]
Said I'm trapped in a room seeing faces
Pacing and painting the room of many places
Stasis placed in the world so lonely
She told me to fuck her in her mouth while her nose bleed
Slowly eating regrets just like they told me
Feed me a dream and some drugs till I od
I'm broly folding folgers moldy
Crawling in the arms of a bitch better choke me
Hold me, and smother my fears
Catch all my tears till they all disappear
Lady and the tramp bury bones here
Deep into the slit till we're both clear
Dig 'em up fuck 'em up I let me bite
Only my skeletons tell me I'm right
Injecting your lies in my eyes till I die
Clutching your bones on the bed in the night
Passive fucking these bitches up into ashes
I hold them for ransom and throw 'em on the mattres
Bad bitch she told me “I used to be an actress”
Past tense pulling me deeper into the madness
Passion split water walking hollow masochist
Dangle from the cross casketless
Walking out the grave passionless
The bastard lives
[Outro: All]
Goddamn
I don't fuck
With you fakes
With you fakes
Bitch I earned
What I got
I don't take
I don't take
Goddamn
I don't fuck
With you fakes
With you fakes
Bitch I earned
What I got
I don't take
I don't take
Goddamn
I don't fuck
With you fakes
With you fakes
Bitch I earned
What I got
I don't take
I don't take
Goddamn
I don't fuck
With you fakes
With you fakes
Bitch I earned
What I got
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
I don't take
