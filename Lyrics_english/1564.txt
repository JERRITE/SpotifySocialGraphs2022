Belfast City Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll be on my way
Leaving west L.A. at sunrise
The time's been great
I kinda wish that I could stay
For a little while longer

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a goal but I want you to know
I'll be back again
[Chorus]
I'm going home to the people I love
Where I was born and raised
Where the streets and the histories remain
But oh how the times have changed
I know it rains but it's always pretty
Back to the friends that I can't take with me
We'll have night out in Belfast City alright

[Verse 2]
Now I can't sleep but I can tell you honestly
It's fine
'Cause I'm still dreaming 'cause it has got me feeling a little high
But that's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I swear I don't care if I ever have to leave again

[Chorus]
I'm going home to the people I love
Where I was born and raised
Where the streets and the histories remain
But oh how the times have changed
I know it rains but it's always pretty
Back to the friends that I can't take with me
We'll have night out in Belfast City alright

[Bridge]
Now I'm on my way
And I can't say that it's gonna be easy
'Cause wherever I go
I hold you close, please believe me
Oh please believe me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I swear I don't care if I ever have to leave again

[Chorus]
I'm going home to the people I love
Where I was born and raised
Where the streets and the histories remain
But oh how the times have changed
I know it rains but it's always pretty
Back to the friends that I can't take with me
We'll have night out in Belfast City
We'll have night out in Belfast City
We'll have night out in Belfast City alrightEmbed
