West End Kids Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is the suburb where we found love
There was a chair where you wrapped your arms around me
So maybe you could walk me to my car
Kiss me down to my bones, we were gone from the start

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Walking these streets only makes me sad
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Gone and lost, the realest thing that I ever had
[Chorus]
And it breaks my heart just to see us there
Hand in hand, standing on the corner in a hologram
And I reach but we disappear
Oh my loneliness is the only thing different here
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
Always stay the same, always stay the same

[Verse 2]
We never did have much, living in a house of fire
Friends were in and out, you and I were getting high most of the time
But when our old house burned down
We all huddled in the blankets knowing everything was different now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And seeing these faces only brings back pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Gone and lost, the only thing that made me feel sane

[Chorus]
And it breaks my heart just to see us there
Hand in hand, standing on the corner in a hologram
And I reach but we disappear
Oh my loneliness is the only thing different here
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same

We had it all, it all, it all
We had it all, it all, it all
Too much, too much of everything
We had it all, it all, it all
We had it all, it all, it all
We had it all, it all, it all
Too much, too much of everything
We had it all, it all, it all

[Chorus]
And it breaks my heart just to see us there
Hand in hand, standing on the corner in a hologram
And I reach but we disappear
Oh my loneliness is the only thing different here
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the same
West End kids, always stay the same, always stay the sameEmbed
