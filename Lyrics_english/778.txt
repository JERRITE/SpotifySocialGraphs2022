You call me (remix) lyrics [letter of "you call me (remix)"]

[Intro: 21st floor, Maluma]
Get on, get out, go on
Remix

[Verse 1: Maluma]
Tell me if one day I will feel your body again
Something tells me that you want to see me again
Hey, hey baby
From that night I don't stop thinking about you
You well know that I am your man because he does not make you feel
[Pre-car: 21st floor, Maluma]
He never knew how to me
He doesn't know every space in your skin
I know I'm not perfect but I'll tell you
He doesn't know how to treat a woman

[Choir: 21st floor, Maluma]
When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today
When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today

[Verse 2: Floor 21]
I am the one who stole a kiss on a night raining
Wet we end up making love
My strange skin your body and mouth your kisses
Tell me, you, if you miss me as I do

[Verse 3: Maluma]
Y-and tell me, mamacita, what do you want me to do, mom?
We make mischief until you can't
Baby, from your house I'm going to get you
And if your mother asks you tell me I'm going to steal you
Ask for the sky and I give it to you
To the same moon, for you, I'm going
Everything you want, here I am
Listen to this remix from the pretty boy

When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today
When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today

[Verse 4: Floor 21]
â€˜Toy crazy to get you out of this loneliness
And give you those kisses that he no longer gives you
You call when you want here I'm going to be
And I waited for you, I'm going to fix it
I know you are for me and I am for you
Let's not let what we have here

[Pre-car: Floor 21]
He never knew how to me
He doesn't know every space in your skin
I know I'm not perfect but I'll tell you
He doesn't know how to treat a woman

[Chorus: Floor 21]
When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today
When you want you call me, you call me
I am the one who gave you love and the one who gives you today
[Outro: Maluma, (floor 21)]
When you want you call me (21st floor!)
You call me (Hey!), Haha (hey, hey!)
You call us (Hey!)
A Piso 21 or Maluma (Over, get off, get off!)
