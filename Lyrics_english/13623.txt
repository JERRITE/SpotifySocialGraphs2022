Every Time Lyrics[Intro]
(Alive)
(You say you've—)

[Verse 1]
You say you’ve left it all behind
And I've been there a thousand times before
'Cause even when you close your eyes
It’s got you there, it's holding tight

[Chorus]
But it ain't fair, it ain't right, you're in my head
Got me sick to death at night
Such a shame, a wasted life
You're at the edge, I know you tried
We'll find our way back every time
We'll find our way back every time
[Drop]
We’ll find our way back evеry time

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing to prove, and what’s to lose to gеt it right?
And you'll come to find
Down in the deep
That what’s left is not so out of reach
Caught in between
Even in your dreams
Regrets you never meant to keep alive

[Bridge]
Pick it up, do it one more time
You can't lose if you never try

[Drop]
(Alive)
(Alive)

[Verse 2]
So take a breath, now let it pass
Such heaviness could never last like this
'Cause sure enough, when I look back
And I can't believe the chance we had
You might also like[Chorus]
But it ain’t fair, it ain't right, you're in my head
Got me sick to death at night
Such a shame, a wasted life
You're at the edge, I know you tried
We'll find our way back every time
We'll find our way back every time

[Drop]
We'll find our way back every time

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing to prove, and what's to lose to get it right?
And you'll come to find
Down in the deep
That what's left is not so out of reach
Caught in between
Even in your dreams
Regrets you never meant to keep alive
Pick it up, do it one more time
You can't lose if you never try
Pick it up, do it one more time
You can't lose if you never try
(I know you try to hide)

[Outro]
And you'll come to find
Down in the deep
That what's left is not so out of reach
Caught in between
Even in your dreams
Regrets you never meant to keep alive2Embed
