Forbidden to love me (live from the Sports Palace) Lyricsno I don't love you and you have nothing left
Your mouth is silent
Your eyes no longer illuminate me
They do not cause me anxiety

I know very well
That your life is no longer the same
That you can no longer forget me
That I became your life
In a memory and nothing else
For you it was just a game you tried to win
And now I will make the award pay

You don't realize that the time between you and I ended
Don't look at me like that I'm going to tell you no
That is prohibited, prohibited, prohibited
Forbidden to love me
Do not kneel do not ask me to return again
Do me a favor because your good I know you are going to learn
That is prohibited, prohibited, prohibited
Forbidden to love me
Forbidden to love me

If I'm leaving and I don't tell you anything
Your face does not take away my dream
My bed no longer has a place and I want to dream

I know very well
What do you call and want to talk to me
Understand that I am not the same
That nothing you tell me I believe it and it is true

For you it was just a game you tried to win
And now I will make the award pay

You don't realize that the time between you and I ended
Don't look at me like that I'm going to tell you no
That is prohibited, prohibited, prohibited
Forbidden to love me
Do not kneel do not ask me to return again
Do me a favor because your good I know you are going to learn
That is prohibited, prohibited, prohibited
Forbidden to love me
Forbidden to love me

Forbidden to love me

You don't realize that the time between you and I ended
Don't look at me like that I'm going to tell you no
That is prohibited, prohibited, prohibited
Forbidden to love me
Forbidden to love me
Forbidden to love me
