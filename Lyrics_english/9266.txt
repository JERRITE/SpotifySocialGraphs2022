Save Your Love LyricsSave your love, my darling, save your love
For summer nights with moon and stars above
A serenade I long to sing you
The reddest rose I always bring you
Save your love for Roma and for me

Darling, I will love you endlessly
Even though you're far away from me
I can't forget the words I told you
How it felt to love and hold you
Love like ours will last eternally
Save your love, my darling, save your love
For summer nights with moon and stars above
A serenade I long to sing you
The reddest rose I always bring you
Save your love for Roma and for me

Even though it's been so very long
The memory of our love still lingers on
I can't wait to hold and kiss you
Don't you know how much I miss you
Darling, sing for me our lover's song

Salva l'amore cara, salva l'amore
Le notte d'estate la luna l'estelle lassu
A serenade I long to sing you
The reddest rose I always bring you
Salva l'amore per Roma e per me

(La, lala, lala lala, lala) Io ti amo caro
(Lala, lala lala, lala lala) I love you
I can't wait to hold and kiss you
Don't you know how much I miss you
Darling, sing for me our lover's song

Save your love, my darling, save your love (Oh, you know that I will)
For summer nights with moon and stars above (Oh, I love you still)
A serenade I long to sing you
The reddest rose I always bring you
Save your love for Roma and for meYou might also likeEmbed
