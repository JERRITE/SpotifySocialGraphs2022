A Moment of Clarity Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would describe it as an invisible darkness
Casting a shadow, a blinding black
Guarded by hope, my soul is kept safe
From the bloody claws

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Look to beyond
What vision lets me see
Time after time
Unneeded misery
[Pre-Chorus 2]
My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight
And hope for sight

[Chorus]
Open my eyes wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why

[Verse 2]
Life is like a mystery
With many clues, but with few answers
To tell us what it is that we can do to look
For messages that keep us from the truth

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Look to beyond
What vision lets me see
Time after time
Unneeded misery

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight
And hope for sight
You might also like[Chorus]
Open my eyes wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why
Oh God, why?Embed
