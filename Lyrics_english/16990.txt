Broken Wings Lyrics[Intro]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
[Verse 1]
I got broken wings, but I'm still flyin'
With a loss of faith, and I'm still tryin'
Got stereotype, radios turn me down
Cause I won't turn up on the mic
I'd rather rap about my life
And give advice to someone
Who's about to give up on life
That's real, and fuck how you feel
Independent, cause I don't need a deal
Picked up the mic and I put down the pills
Picked up the vibes
They don't care how you feel
Remember my Grandpa passed away
And it killed, my Dad
I saw life isn't promised, so i made a promise
That I'll pursuit my dreams
No matter how they feel
They said that I can't
Took out the T into a T
I killed it
Made sacrifices, always workin' O.T
When they call in, I will fill in
All eyes on me when
I decide to step in the buildin'
Fuck that radio music you listen to
I spit that real shit
In high school I was unpopular
Never fit in with the cool kids
They were busy partyin'
And makin' a bunch of excuses
I sat home, buildin' my craft
I had a dream, I'm pursuin'
It's hard to have these hopes and dreams
Especially when I got
You might also like[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Verse 2]
You don't have to relate to me
You don't have to have hate for me
You don't have words to say to me
You don't even have to pray for me
Do you
Cause I'll do me
Until the day that I'm through
'Remember back then
Back-stabbin' friends told me to not to
'Remember they said that if you need me then I got you
When I needed you most, you were a ghost
And you left me feelin' empty
And then I lost hope
You want me to fight, how can I cope
Slowly realizing my friends come and go
Findin' myself at the end of the road
I'm dyin' inside but live like I won't
The time is getting closer
And those beneath me are getting farther
Everyday I'm growin' older
I see that I'm not a part of society
They're eyeing me
Dyin' for me to fall apart
Cause I have a chance and they missed theirs
Cause I'm workin' harder
I was apart of the kids at school
Askin' why don't they like us
It's like we don't exist
We're there, but they do not mind us
I'm a little mental
It's okay to dream while you are mind fucked
Spreadin' both of my wings
I wanna fly but
[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Outro]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'12Embed
