Ffwd lyrics [lyrics for "ffwd"]

[Hook 1: Tua & Raf Camora]
I live like on pretzel
Why should I think about what will happen tomorrow?
I prefer to live briefly and well, on a large foot
And do nothing else to me than here
FFWD, Dikka
Yeah
Yeah
[Part 1: Tua]
The scenery is in the back seat
Heartbeat Speedcore, Kick Drum, 320 BPM
Body fluids behind BTMG
Movement while standing, tunneling, yeah, yeah
The girl next to me does it without being asked, Yeah, Yeah
Two hundred km/h, stroboscope
I fall into the seat, she puts on like a monologue
Everything turns monochrome, I see the tanga shop
It is as fast as my hand in her hair
My orgasm comes out, like another car that rams us and lets us drive into the wall head -on

[Hook 2: Tua & Raf Camora]
I live like on pretzel
Why should I think about what will happen tomorrow?
I prefer to live briefly and well, on a large foot
And do nothing else to me than here
Dear, I prefer to fall deep than never have been up there at all
Middle, middle fingers high and pretense
I don't want any other speed
FFWD, Dikka
Yeah
Yeah

[Part 2: Tua]
The scenery is in a crowd
Em or something, catch chants
My boys nearby here in the sea of ​​chaos
The guy really wants it and I go to him
He pushes me back, I give him a fist, yeah, yeah
War two from the side, stand up again, yeah, yeah
"Where do you stand, I need you" - fuck, have no reception
My wife wants to hold me what she can't do
And so I run into fists, get kicked on the ground
Lose reflection, everything is without sound
I see sepia during the day, monochrome, monochrome, monochrome (monochrome) at night, monochrome (monochrome)
I see sepia during the day, monochrome, monochrome, monochrome (monochrome) at night, monochrome (monochrome)

I live like on pretzel
Why should I think about what will happen tomorrow?
I prefer to live briefly and well, on a large foot
And do nothing else to me than here
Dear, I prefer to fall deep than never have been up there at all
Middle, middle fingers high and pretense
I don't want any other speed
FFWD, Dikka

[Outro: Tua & Raf Camora]
Drive into the city center, hunting through the night
Everything that I have, that's here, it's already here
Hunting through the night, everything I have ', it's already here
Drive into the city center, hunting through the night
Everything that I have, that's here, it's already here
Hunting through the night, everything I have ', it's already here
Drive into the city center
