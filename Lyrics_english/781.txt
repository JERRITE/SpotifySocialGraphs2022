Mocca Lyrics ["Mocca" letter]

[Chorus]
I love you more than chocolate, 'you will pass'
Everything is so normal, but with you is abnormal
Without you I feel bad
I love you like Coffee in the morning
You know well that I want you (you know perfectly what)
I want you
L-a-l-o
[Verse 1]
For you I have more enemy
Coconut, Samarian Golden Full
Panty no, Party yes, in New York, full tattoo
McLovin, Supercool, bites this bubbaloo
Personnel, 2C No, 2CB, Bubble Gum
Took Any, I'm also happy, Pray for Me (All Right)
Best of all, you're there (Wuh)
Best of all, you have trip (Trapical Mind)

[Chorus]
I love you more than chocolate, 'you will pass'
Everything is so normal (seriously), but with you is abnormal
Without you I feel bad
I love you like Coffee in the morning
You know well that I want you
I want you (Trapical Mind)

[Bridge]
You know who I (L-A), the man who drives you crazy
Zafa to that weon who lowers the note, proves this note
You Know Who's This (That's right)
It's me, the man that makes you crazy (wuh)
Now e 'that weon that lowers the note, proves this note and explodes

Bum, easy, try this note, try this note and explode
Bum, it's lit, bum, that's right
Bum (hehe), try this note, try this note and explode
