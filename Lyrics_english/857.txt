The Lyrics task ["the task"]

[Verse 1: Mario Bautista]
How nice it would be to wake up and that you are by my side, Yeh-Yeh
Some kisses for breakfast and an express coffee, no

[Pre-car]
Make love before getting up
Look for the excuse for a bath
What is the plan for later?
[Choir: Mario Bautista & Floor 21]
Pa 'when I see you, baby, pa' when I see you, Yeah
I'm going to fill your mouth with kisses and drink your body to the 'rock'
When I see you, baby, pa 'when I see you
Because missing us now is our task

[Verse 2]
And we deserve it mai
See us in person, no more Skype
Walk around the park, meet the city
Hands, I don't ask anymore
That's the only thing, I want to make it public
Up with you with you, zero anonymous
And what I feel for you is the synonym
Of a sincere I love you, a true love

[Pre-car]
Make love before getting up
Look for the excuse for a bath
What is the plan for later?

[Chorus]
Pa 'when I see you, mommy, pa' when I see you, Yeah
I'm going to fill your mouth with kisses and drink your body to the 'rock'
When I see you, baby, pa 'when I see you
Because missing us now is our task

Yeh, when I see you, it is noticed as my eye 'you flirt
It doesn't matter where we are, with you, wherever
Taking coronita of that that refreshes
From your body I am a fan, I do not demo 'so much' turn '
Yeh, from the 'vece' that I have tried you, I already lost the account
With me you are loose, Yeh, you have my head spinning
When I see you with the look ', I'm going to leave you without clothes
Do what you imagine when you play
We are kilometer 'and I know your intimate secrets
I see you and I promise you, I'm going to go crazy
I'm dying to see you again
Take away the stress of having you
Woh-Woh, and your photo yesterday
You know well how to go crazy
(Get on)

[Choir: Mario Bautista & Floor 21]
When I see you, baby, pa 'when I see you, Yeah
I'm going to fill your mouth with kisses and drink your body to the 'rock'
When I see you, baby, pa 'when I see you
Because missing us now is our task

[Outro]
Because missing us has always been the task
I'm with the Sunamy pa 'to'as mamis, Yeh
Mario B, Mario B, Mario B
She says she is pa 'mi, Yeh-Yeh
