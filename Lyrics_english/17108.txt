10Fifty I Luv Ya Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
(10Fifty, I love you)

[Chorus]
10Fifty, I love you
S 550, woodgrain inside, shit look like a dresser
Seen so many real niggas die
Started lookin' at life different
Ho said she love you, she lied
You trust that ho, boy, you trippin'
Niggas so broke, can't pay attention
I'm good on the West Coast
Hundreds all blue, nigga, long live Nipsey
Sometimes I be wantin' to crash out, boy, this shit get temptin'
But I came too far and I can't let a fuck nigga trick me
Yes, I might fuck with him
But I fuck with them from a distance
Chasin' that money, I get it
I'm on the way, it don't matter the distancе
They all on my page, wanna see how I'm livin'
'Round my way, shit really gеt risky
I get them racks, handle that business
[Verse]
Spend so many racks, shit make me dizzy
Car so fast, hit the gas and lift it
Gotta keep my foot on they neck 'til I kill 'em
Came straight out the dirt, wanna know how I did it
I stay on my grind, I ain't got no time to be waitin' for no nigga
When they hold out they hand, then I hold up middle fingers
Fuck 'em, they wouldn't have shit for me neither
When it come to fans, got me paranoid
Told my brother, "Man, watch these people"
I don't got no ho in my heart
I used to be nice, but they tried, that shit made me evil
I don't give a fuck 'bout the money, I didn't have a dime, I make this lil' shit look easy
Sometimes this shit get hard, I hop in the car by myself and I roll up some weed
Free Mel, free Juggman Trey, Fatboy did not tell
Know they hate and they plot, but I dare 'em
This not a bowling alley, why would the hell I spare 'em?
Fuck 'em, spray 'em, Air Force my range
I'm way in the air, I cannot see 'em
He used to be gang, now he can't hang over here
That chopper been singin', it hit you all in your ear
Ooh, shit, I just flipped a switch
Make 'em dance, Tok-Tik
Ooh, ooh, shit, TikTok
I heard they stop listenin' to weak-ass rappers when my shit drop
Put a gangster lil' bitch on 'em
She gon' give him the head, fool, now we got the drop

But I came too far and I can't let a fuck nigga trick me

'Round my way, shit really get risky
I get them racks, handle that businessEmbed
