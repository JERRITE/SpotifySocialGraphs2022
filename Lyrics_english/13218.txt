Take Off Ur Pants Lyrics[Verse 1]
When am I gonna get out of bed
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When am I gonna get a better head
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When am I gonna go back to school
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When am I gonna start being cool
Like everybody else is, everybody else is?

[Chorus]
Now that everyone's gone, I can tell you the truth
I don't love you, I like you
Now that everyone's gone, I can tell you it hurts
Honey, I am just like you
[Verse 2]
When am I gonna find a better man
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When am I gonna follow through with my plans
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When am I gonna find a better man
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?
When are you gonna take off your pants
Like everybody else does, everybody else does?

[Chorus]
Now that everyone's gone I can tell you the truth
I don't love you, I like you
Now that everyone's gone, I can tell you it hurts
Honey, I am just like youYou might also like5Embed
