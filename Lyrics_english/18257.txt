[Verse 1: Chinese Kitty]
Yeah
I don't really care for the fuck shit, came for the bag, you can look, don't touch this
Nigga wanna fuck this pussy, gotta suck this pussy, lemme see the way that tongue hit
Get up and ride on his face
I'm drippin', he lovin the taste
He hit from the back and I'm takin' his racks while he wipin' my nut off his face
Real shit, big drip
Hit the pussy once, fell in love with a lit bitch
Rap bitch, talk slick
Keep my name out your mouth fore' you suck on this full clit
I don't really care for you hoes
I don't laugh, I don't joke, I don't play with you hoes
Gotta gang of bitches, finna flock on you hoe
Pull up on you like a Huggie, lil hoe

[Chorus: Khia, Fivio Foreign, & Chinese Kitty]
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now (Aye!)
Do it, do it

(Hi-Hi-Hit the pussy once, fell in love with a lit bitch)
Do it, do it (Favi!)
Do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now

Well bitch
I gotta watch you, fell in love with a lit bitch, not you
Push what, stop who?
Favio Foreign, I got you (ayy)
Shit ain't Favi, why it's hurtin'?
She can take it like a virgin
She seein' me and gettin' nervous (bow!)
Big drip, squirtin'
I'm too sick, I need nurses
She's too thick, yeah she's too curvy
She that bitch, she need purses
Baja, Birkins
Whatever she doin', it's workin
Surgery, surgeons
I fell in love with this person
If she don't like em', she gon' curve em', ayy

[Chorus: Khia, French Montana, & Chinese Kitty]
Do it, do it (Uh)
Do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it (Do it!)

Do it, do it (Chinese Kitty, nigga! Montana!)
Do it, do it, do it now
[Verse 3: French Montana]
Lil mama gon' twerk
For that crocodile Birkin
Baguette, AP, time perfect
Big purchase
She Angela Yee with the lip service
Disco inferno
Drip game on turbo
Got juice like Herbo
Make em' violate, Roberto
Deuce deuce in the fur coat
Do it, don't play
We on beef, like some bae
We on keys like Andre
Refugee on the hills like Forte
Cinematic, hundred carats, pinky ring, plus the paddock
Bling bling, hunnid links up
Ching ching, Brink truck
Montana

[Chorus: Khia & Chinese Kitty]
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it
(Hi-Hi-Hit the pussy once, fell in love with a lit bitch)
Do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it
(Hit the pussy once, fell in love wit-)
Do it, do it, do it nowEmbed
