Into the Fire (Acoustic Version) LyricsCome on, come on
Put your hands into the fire
Explain, explain
As I turn, I meet the power
This time, this time
Turning white and senses dying
Pull up, pull up
From one extreme to another

From the summer to the spring
From the mountain to the air
From Samaritan to sin
And it's waiting on the end
Come on, come on
Put your hands into the fire
Explain, explain
As I turn, I meet the power
This time, this time
Turning white and senses dying
Pull up, pull up
From one extreme to another

From the summer to the spring
From the mountain to the air
From Samaritan to sin
And it's waiting on the end

Now I'm low, I'm looking out, I'm looking in
Way down, the lights are dimmer
Now I'm low, I'm looking out, I'm looking in
Way down
Way down, Way down, mmm~
Way down, Way down, mmm~

Come on, come on
Put your hands into the fire
Come on, come onYou might also likeEmbed
