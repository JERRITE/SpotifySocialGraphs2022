Fall First Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're going far, far, give me your hand now
We're going faster than I can take
I slam the brakes but you say no way
And in no time 'fore you know, we're there

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me fall first, give me your hand
We going far, far, don't know our way out
Let me fall first, give me your hand
We going far, far, don't know our way out
[Chorus]
See my plans all fall apart
I can't feel nothing in my heart
I was in my room
And you knew exactly what to do
I know who you are
I wanna dance when I look at you
I want my heart awake
But don't want my earth to quake

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)

[Verse 2]
We're going far far, give me your hand now
We're going faster than I can take
I slam the brakes but you say no way
And in no time 'fore you know, we're there

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me fall first, give me your hand
We going far, far, don't know our way out
Let me fall first, give me your hand
We going far, far, don't know our way out

See my plans all fall apart
I can't feel nothing in my heart
I was in my room
And you knew exactly what to do
I know who you are
I wanna dance when I look at you
I want my heart awake
But don't want my earth to quake

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(In your eyes, I see a heaven)Embed
