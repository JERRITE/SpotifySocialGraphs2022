I was me lyricsque very late was
Now I am that
That nakes your skin

(Dayme and the high)

Don't try anymore to look for her
You don't see that with me she left
I took care of erase
All the suffering and so
The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
(Kevin Roldán)
While you lied

You keep writing, calling
And she with me traveling, the world touring
I do it better than you
I always come to's
It lies when it dawns here

Is that she is mine
With me it was that he found the joy
Someone who gives him all day
Another philosophy, that you do not understand
I don't blame you, daddy, you don't sell

K.R., Baby

Now you want to come back
Like nothing
As if you had never done anything
And as if I was never there I

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
And with my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

As a result of your heartbreak
She looked for me, I gave her passion and heat
He wrapped and forgot what he felt for you
And no matter how much you promise, more in you do not trust

I saw her die, but I made her relive
After you lost it you want to intervene
But no matter how much you try, you will not recover it
The damage you caused cannot be remedied

Hey, now the one who suffers is you
Now the one who cries as a fool is you
But this is too late to recover it
I recommend that you don't even look for it
The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

While you lied
And you said just fantasies
The days passed and my most was done
I forgot the way it was with you
He marked my itinerary
And to 'what I taught him

My wife became
Because I made my man
And every part of his skin has already forgot your name
Don't call her, don't look for them
Don't follow her, don't write it
Go with me on a plane
And you don't see you from above

He who saw her cry, was me
He who made her fly, was me
You were just the problem
Of which I was the solution
And if you don't answer it, it's because that is your answer, Yeh!

Don't try anymore to look for her
You don't see that with me she left
I took care of erase
All the suffering and so

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

The one who saw her cry was me
And in your bed he made love
With my kisses I cured the pain
While you lied

Hey, you screwed up, Pai, now the one who gets it is me
