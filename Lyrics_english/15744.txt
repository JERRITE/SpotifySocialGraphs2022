Lyrics love me again [verse 1]
That nothing lasts forever
It is a common phrase
That sounds very different
Since you left

[Chorus 1]
Love me again
Don't punish me
Come here to say
How it lives
With the cold in the soul
How do I do without you
Without you
[Verse 2]
They say time heals everything
But one hundred years are very few
Because I'm sure
That although you try the world
You'll come
Because you don't know
Be happy without me

[Chorus 2]
Love me again
Do not hurt me
How should i do
To break this cruel silence
Of not knowing more about you
Of you

[Chorus 3]
Love me again
Do not destroy me
Come here to say how you live
With the cold in the soul
How do I do without you
Without you

[Verse 2]
They say time heals everything
But one hundred years are very few
Because I'm sure
That although you try the world
You will come because you don't know how to be happy without me

Do not live without trembed
