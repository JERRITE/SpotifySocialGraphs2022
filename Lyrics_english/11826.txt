Pretty song (Remix) Lyrics [lyrics by "Song beautiful (remix)" ft. Jiggy Drama & Emiid]

[Intro]
With you I feel good (that's a remix), calm and relaxed (oh yeah)
I don't need more (it's an honor), when you're (it's a pleasure)
And I'm happy to have you here by my side

[Verse 1: emicidal]
I want time for reflections
To see dancing brains and hearts
Poets, what are your functions today?
The world seeks likes, an army of clones
More of the same, where is lyricism?
It is terrorism to play poems in abyss
A sad fight, only hood
She shouts you, shouts, but nobody else listens to her
Ent√£o Ela Veste A Nova Rupa (new clothes)
Carrega No Batom Da Boca (in the mouth)
Sentence louca when ran
But a cortina opens and the outing singing assim
[Chorus]
With you I feel good, calm and relaxed
I don't need anymore, when you are with me
And I'm happy to have you here by my side
(As on the beach, Baby)
With you I feel fine
The taste of your kisses melts me
That upload me and get off
And make my whole body stir

[Post-car]
Ohh, Ouhh, Ohh (Ah, but how rich!)
Just a love song
Empty and pretty
Ohh, Ouhh, ohh
Just a love song
Empty and pretty

[Verse 2: Jiggy drama]
So much that I would like to say
But if I record it, it would not be a hit
I must limit myself to the typical "I love you"
Without you, under the stars of heaven and I prefer
Make money and buy me a house
Making sticky choirs that sing the masses
I must not sing the truth to other narcissistic artists
To sound on the lists
Jiggy, don't insist
Okay, now I want them to sing the choir that Ouh-Ohh says
That does not matter what the rhyme says, end Ouh-Ouh
Because that never fails
Cheesy to cross the line
With a papaya juice
While 'tamo on the beach
Singing
You Might Also Like [Choir]
With you I feel good, calm and relaxed
I don't need anymore, when you are with me
And I'm happy to have you here by my side
With you I feel fine
The taste of your kisses melts me
That upload me and get off
And make my whole body stir

[Post-car]
Ohh, Ouhh, Ohh (Ah, but how rich!)
Just a love song
Empty and pretty
Ohh, Ouhh, ohh
Just a love song
Empty and pretty

[Outro]
(Bacayo Brass)
And pa 'Colombia, and Pa Brazil
Only, just a beautiful love song
It's Jiggy Drama, it's emicidal
And distracted moral
Only, just a beautiful love song (monkey with a cell phone)
Distracted moral, his emicida brother
Only, just a beautiful love song
Jiggy J, This is a remix
Only, just a beautiful song1embed
