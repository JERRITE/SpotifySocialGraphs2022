Boomshakalaka (Bassjackers Remix) Lyrics [verse 1: Sebastián Yatra]
Your eyes already tell me what you want
You are not like all women
You like how the rhythm attacks you
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka
My eyes already tell you what I want
Eat the caramel complete
With that belt that kills me
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (OH, Yes)

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra]
Again again
The head and feet
They move with me
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yes)
Again again
The head and feet
They move with me
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yes)
[Break/Build Up Vocal]
Oh Yes, Oh andеs
Oh boomshakalaka, boomshakalaka (Yes)
Oh Yes, Oh Yes
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yеs)

Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yes)

[Verse 2: Emilia, Sebastian Yatra]
Come Dance with Boomshakalaka (Hey, Emilia)
With that little look that does not kill anyone
I start with your mouth and bass to Buenos Aires
I know how you like it and you also know
You know it, you know it (Hey)
You like the movement my body has
When you touch me, I leave myself
Come, I give you everything I have
Everything I have (Oh, Yes)

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Emilia]
Again again
The head and feet (the feet)
They move with me
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yes)
Again again
The head and feet
They move with me
Boomshakalaka, Boomshakalaka (Yes)
