Bloodshot Lyrics[Verse 1]
I haven't been sleeping
Just stare at the fan all night, yeah
Got tired of dreaming
Running into you all the time
Even the good ones leave me messed up
Leave me aching, wanna wake up
So, I haven't been sleeping
Just stare at the fan all night
(And wait it out)
[Chorus 1]
And my friends say I'm losing my mind
And my parents check in all the time
But it's harder to see you're not mine
With my bloodshot eyes
Bloodshot eyes

[Verse 2]
The colors are different
Foreign and beautiful, yeah
Got this white noise and music
Filling my head like the signal's broken
Losing focus, losing moments
Having conversation, hours wasting away
The colors are different
Foreign and beautiful, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
And my friends say I'm losing my mind
And my parents check in all the time
But it's harder to see you're not mine
With my bloodshot eyes

[Chorus 2]
And I know that they're all probably right
And I know I should just say goodnight
But it's harder to see you're not mine
With my bloodshot eyes
Bloodshot eyes
Bloodshot eyes
