[Verse 1: Eloy]
I have searched in the pile, but there is no other the same
And I would give what I have to be able to grab
Your sculptural body makes me hallucinar
They say she melts you if she can touch her
Extraordinary, watch how it controls you
Lonely, she
He starts traveling like a dose of rola
To approach her you have to line up in the tail
Extraordinary, watch how it controls you
Lonely, she
He starts traveling like a dose of rola
To approach her you have to line up in the tail

[Bridge: Randy]
She comes from afar, well far
It makes you tremble and take off from the ground
She comes from afar, well far
One day I saw her dancing on the moon
She comes from afar
One day I saw her dancing on the moon
She comes from afar, well far
One day I saw her dancing on the moon

[Verse 2: randy]

You are going to go up there

[Verse 3: Eloy]
That down a little while
That I want to give him a cariñito
Soft clothes
To kidnap you, to show you
How do we do them here in the Terrestrial Globe
And even if I have to rent a spacecraft
Pa 'to the moon go to look, I'm going to arrive
And if I don't get to Mars
I do whatever for clothes take off
And even if I have to rent a spacecraft
Pa 'to the moon go to look, I'm going to arrive
And if I don't get to Mars
I do whatever for clothes take off

[Bridge: Randy]
She comes from afar, well far
It makes you tremble and take off from the ground
She comes from afar, well far
One day I saw her dancing on the moon
She comes from afar
One day I saw her dancing on the moon
She comes from afar, well far
One day I saw her dancing on the moon
[Chorus: Randy]
She is not normal, she takes me up to me
Cool, come, cool
Out of the planet she e '
Cool, come, cool
Out of the planet she e '
Cool, come, cool
Out of the planet she e '
