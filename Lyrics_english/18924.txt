Between Heaven & Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dyin' to live, livin' to die
Ain't no hellos here, nothing but goodbyes
It's like singing a song, cannot be sung
It's like having to end child what's yet to have begun, Lord

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I been lost somewhere between Heaven and Hell, mm
[Verse 2]
All that you know and all that you knew
In the end child, tell me what's it all mean to you?
Don't forget just who and where you are
You can spread your wings, son, but don't you spread yourself too far, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I been lost somewhere between Heaven and Hell, yeah, mm Somewhere

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I been lost between Heaven and Hell
Hey, hey, hey, now
Where I am at times I just can't tell
Hey, hey, hey, now
I been lost somewhere between Heaven and HellYou might also likeEmbed
