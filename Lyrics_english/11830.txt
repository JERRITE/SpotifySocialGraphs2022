The culprit Lyrics [verse 1] 
 Look at me now, where I have arrived! 
 I knew it would end like this 
 I am a sea of crying but I only blame me 
 I cried for you, was it worth it? 
 Did you feel what I felt? 
 Not clearly, that's why I just blame me 
 It seems that I did not understand 
 The life you wanted to try 
 And cause many things without thinking 
 [Chorus] 
 So look me in the eyes now 
 Did you think it wouldn't end like this? 
 Don't feel bad if you too 
 Want to blame me 

 [Verse 2] 
 Please let me pay the damage I have done 
 I would not have to bother 
 But you know I can't say goodbye without crying 

 [Chorus] 
 So look me in the eyes now 
 Did you think it wouldn't end like this? 
 Don't feel bad if you too 
 You want to blame meyou might also likembed
