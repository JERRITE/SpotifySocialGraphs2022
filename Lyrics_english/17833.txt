Feel Like Pop Lyrics[Intro]
Woo, woo

[Chorus]
I got twin Glocks like two bitches (Got a whole lotta shots)
You know I'm top, I'm too gifted (Wah)
Feel like I'm Pop, I move different (Woo)
Amiri jeans, it's too fitted (But I still got a chop)
Pop me a Perc' I snooze in it (Look)
We on the spot, my Woos in it (Woah)
I got twin Glocks, like two bitches (Got a whole lotta shots)
You know I'm top, I'm too gifted (Wah)
Feel like I'm Pop, I move different (Woo)
Amiri jeans, it's too fitted (But I still got the chop)
Move like the chop got boom in it (Yeah)
We on the spot, my Woos in it (Woah)
[Verse 1]
Thirty on me (Brr, bah)
But I ain't the bum totin' the stick
Bitch, I'm a thot
If I feel like you movin' too funny, then you could get hit (Brr, bah)
Jumped off the porch, they threw me in the mix
We NFL, had to call up a blitz
We never miss
Big 092MLBOA all the way up to the Swish
I call up East, you know that's blood
He bring the sitchy, we call that assist
You know the opp, you know his bitch
I'm fuckin' but I'm still callin' her sis (Ha)
Just hit the mall, I blew a bag
I put a bunch of Dior on my 'fit (I did)
I'm gettin' high, talkin' to bro
Tellin' him what I'ma do to my bricks
I take a trip, told her I need the head like a do-rag (I do)
We cannot do bad (Nope)
I'm hella blood but I'm fuckin' this bitch in a blue flag
How I do that? (Crip, ha)
I got them too mad (What?)
We out in Cali and I'm in a coupe, slide with the roof back (Skrrt)

[Chorus]
I got twin Glocks like two bitches (Got a whole lotta shots)
You know I'm top, I'm too gifted (Wah)
Feel like I'm Pop, I move different (Woo)
Amiri jeans, it's too fitted (But I still got a chop)
Pop me a Perc' I snooze in it (Look)
We on the spot, my Woos in it (Woah)
I got twin Glocks, like two bitches (Got a whole lotta shots)
You know I'm top, I'm too gifted (Wah)
Feel like I'm Pop, I move different (Woo)
Amiri jeans, it's too fitted (But I still got the chop)
Move like the chop got boom in it (Yeah)
We on the spot, my Woos in it (Woah)You might also like1Embed
