Wasting Moonlight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like silence
Is a waste of the lips on your face
Cause we
Get better
With every word we sing
(yeah)

[Chorus]
Well come on, open up
Give me just one reason
Why we've seen enough
We're not even close
Well come on, and wake up
Cause the hours you spend with your eyes closed
You're just wasting moonlight
You're just wasting moonlight
You're just wasting moonlight
Wasting moonlight (Wasting moonlight)
You're just wasting moonlight
[Verse 2]
One whisper
Could save the night
When you feel alone
So take me
Where the silence grows tired

[Chorus]
Well come on, open up
Give me just one reason
Why we've seen enough
We're not even close
Well come on, and wake up
Cause the hours you spend with your eyes closed
You're just wasting moonlight
(Wasting moonlight... Wasting moonlight)
You're just wasting moonlight
You're just wasting moonlight
(Wasting Moonlight)
You're just wasting moonlight
You're just wasting moonlight
You're just wasting moonlightYou might also likeEmbed
