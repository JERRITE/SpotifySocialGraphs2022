Girl Like That Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you think this life would make me bolder
But I'm running scared is all
Well, I hang on everything about you
Well, you think I'd settle down, cause I'm older
But I roll with the change is all
Well, I'm same old trailer trash in new shoes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, she gets sad when there's nothing going on, yeah
She says it makes her feel damn worthless
[Chorus]
Well, you got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all
It's better than nothing
Well, it's better than nothing

[Verse 2]
Well, I put my hand around your shoulder
You're saying you're scared is all
Well, I think I know too much about you
Well, you think this life would make me colder
I'd give in to the alcohol
I put my loving arms around you, child

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You knew damn well there was nothing going on, yeah
Is that what makes you feel damn worthless?

[Chorus]
Well, you got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all
It's better than nothing
Well, it's better than nothing
Good god
Well, you got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all, no, no
It's better than nothing
Well, it's better than nothing

Yeah, well, she drags you down and she pulls you up
She pulls you up, yeah, yeah
Says that she's sorry now but it's not enough
To pull you up
Well, she's sorry

[Verse 3]
I wake up quick just like I want to
Yeah, but I stay out much too late

[Bridge 2]
Well, you think this life can get a bit unkind
But she stays down 'til the worth is gone
And pulls you up, she pulls you up, yeah
She pulls you up, and over, over

[Chorus]
You got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all
It's better than nothing
Well, it's better than nothing
Good god
Well, you got to think, with a girl like that
Any love at all, no no
It's better than nothing
Well, it's better than nothing
[Outro]
Yeah well, you got to think, with a girl like that
Well, you got to think
With a girl like that
You've got to think with a girl like that
Well, thank herEmbed
