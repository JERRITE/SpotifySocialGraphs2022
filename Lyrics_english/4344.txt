Lyrics cardboard thugs [cardboard wardrobe "]

[Intro]
Me!
What happened, Consul?
Pa 'puts them dates
Los Guasa, Guasa
Vamo'a throwing studio thugs
If they don't trigger, they are studio buses
The Studio is now July
DJ Sonic
I ', pa' puts them dates
The guasons
[Bridge]
The one who sticks to tell you a ram
To every mouth for people scared
On that trip you can go adjust

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Bridge]
To which he passes by getting dates
To the kittens in the disco
Ronca de Chavos and the wallet is hollow

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Verse 1]
Has Rolex, draws, and a couple of Cuban
Brega kilo, and also pounds of marijuana
He only wants to throw a lot of wool
Well, what he has is Panas'
Like a chihuahua that bricks behind bars
Behind the cell
But you see it straight with the pendeja lip

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy
You Might Also Like [verse 2]
Bad face, and with a Bravuc√≥n Guille
You see that walks you with a bastard cut
He does not miss or look at him to know what he is a guason
Matao 'forty guys, but in a song
Look for a broom to sweep the caps
Half of their shorts or reach the ankles
Nor to say goodbye to the year you have pull 'the trigger

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Verse 3]
The guy is to rebuild, discuss, and kill
In the neighborhood they know him as the Super Abnormal
His corillo almost fills a school bus
So anyone, but his alone to fight
I don't know what galaxy they live the war
I bet they do not know or get a bitch
They get with White Lion and Solito 'they bury
Seven feet underground
To those who border on, to those who nebule
They put clowns to see them
They want to put the fecas for one that one creates
You tell him
[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Bridge]
To those who say that they brewed, who kill and fight
Those who snore, and fanfarronean
They are the first to run if the thing gets ugly

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Verse 4]
They can and cut to get to the goal
I should be scared if they chambean your notebook
The little birds already throw the shotguns'
But if there is no bulova then, bordering on mine, I don't get
That is the problem, the one who advocates always pays
The most finite is that the rope is split
Then they 'kill him and say it's for drugs

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Verse 5]
I'm with two long
"Voltio, anything you let me know
If a fight is formed, I take off my shirt "
But the shots sound and get whites like chalk
And they frizz, talk about problems and bristle
I don't know what you want to say that you are Armao '
Teaching what you have, better stay Callao '
With that border you can end up turns out '

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Verse 6]
Partner, I'm from one, I'm without any picket
I am like the Jambu, I do not beef
I am happy with my smoke and my breakfast
And thank God that I don't have to envy none
I am calm, humble, and decent
I sing for the Corillos, and Brugo with to'a the people
Pa ', but if you launch your teeth exploit you
With DJ Sonic is Julio Voltio, the insane
To those who border on, to those who nebule
They put clowns to see them
They want to put the feces that one creates
You tell him

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Bridge]
To those who say that they brewed, who kill and fight
Those who snore, and fanfarronean
They are the first to run if the thing gets ugly

[Chorus]
You are a cardboard creepy

[Outro]
Maleante 'and cardboard, feca
For those who are guillao 'by Psycho
If they don't say Payko are not Payko
Don't be fooled
Vamo 'to throw from Studio's thugs
They are studio buses!
What happened, Consul? Embed
