Don't stop the music, why are you stopping it?
Dancing again, life is a party so
No matter what I do, tick-tock, tick-tock
Life is still going on, it just flows
Hey DJ, play the song, the next song
It's like a music box, stop worrying
Enjoy today, even if it's for a moment
Life is still going on, in any case, it flows

[Verse 1: Mark, Jeno, Jisung]
Ya, why is your spirit down these days?
Ya, straighten your shoulders, I'm by your side
Life doesn't go the way you want it to, uh?
Your heart doesn't go wherever you want it to, uh?
That's right
I guess I'm becoming an adult, I guess that's life
Everyone seems to be going ahead, I'm the only one that has stopped
That's a life
A vague sense of anxiety that seems to be unavoidable
Tell me if you're feeling that
I feel that too sometimes
[Pre-Chorus: Renjun, Haechan]
Throw away your worries for a while
To the sound of the music
Listen to your heart
What you want, do it, just do it

[Chorus: Jisung, Jaemin]
Don't stop the music, why are you stopping it?
Dancing again, life is a party so
No matter what I do, tick-tock-tick-tock
Life is still going on, it just flows
Hey DJ, play the song, the next song
It's like a music box, stop worrying
Enjoy today, even if it's for a moment
Life is still going on, in any case, it flows

[Verse 2: Jeno, Mark, Jisung, Jaemin, *Jaemin & Haechan*]
Come on, everybody does pointless stuff, even tough things
Anyone seeing it would think the world will soon be doomed
While trying to find balance (Yeah), I stumbled a little bit (Yeah)
I gather up my spirit and shoot it upwards (Yeah), tick-tick-tick, boom
Fast-forward to Spring, it's okay to do it again
You might stumble a little to find your own rhythm
You might flow for a while, you might go back a long way
You just have to enjoy it, in the end, you just have *to be* happy

Throw away your worries for a while
To the sound of the music
Listen to your heart
What you want, do it, just do it

[Chorus: Mark, Chenle, Jeno, Renjun]
Don't stop the music, why are you stopping it?
Dancing again, life is a party so
No matter what I do, (Tick-tock, oh) tick-tock
Life is still going on, it just flows
(Oh) Hey DJ, play the song, the next song
It's like a music box, stop worrying
Enjoy today (Yeah), even if it's for a moment
Life is still going on, in any case, it flows

[Bridge: Jaemin, Jisung, Renjun, Haechan, *Chenle*, **Jeno**]
Why is your spirit down these days?
Straighten your shoulders, I'm by your side
So let's go (Let's go)
Nothing can stop you from doing it
*Someday things will pass, you'll know that in the end
So what you waiting for?*  (Waiting for?)
**1-2-3-4**

[Chorus: All, Haechan, Chenle, Renjun]
Don't stop the music, why are you stopping it? (Woo, ooh, woo)
Dancing again, life  is a party so
No matter what I do, tick-tock, tick-tock
Life is still going on (Yeah), it just flows
Hey DJ, play the song (Yeah), the next song
It's like a music box, stop worrying
Enjoy today (Oh), even if it's for a moment
Life is still going on, in any case, it flows
[Outro: Chenle]
Life is still going on
My life still goes onEmbed
