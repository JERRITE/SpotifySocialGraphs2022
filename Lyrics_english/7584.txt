Age Ainâ€™t Nothing But a Number Lyrics[Intro]
May fifth, 1993
Aaliyah's diary
Got it

[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change
[Verse 1]
Here I am and there you are
Your eyes are callin' me to your heart
All you gotta do is knock and I'll let you in
Then we will feel the passion that flows within

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you
And I can't let go
Ooh, my

[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change (My age ain't)
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (But a thing)
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and come with me
And let me show you true ecstasy
Boy, be brave, don't be afraid
'Cause tonight we're gonna go all the way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't mean to be bold
Gotta let you know
I got a thing for you
And I can't let go
Ooh, my

[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number (No)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change (My age)
Age ain't nothin' but a number (Ain't nothin' but a number)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (And this thing)
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change
Oh, no

[Bridge]
So, what's up?
Here I am, reach
Baby, come here
Age ain't nothin' but a number

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
Aaliyah's got a thing for you
And I can't let go, my
[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number (Nothin' but a number)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (Nothin' but a thing)
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change (It'll never change)
Age ain't nothin' but a number (It ain't nothin' but a number)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (It ain't nothin' but a thing)
This lovin' I have for you (No), it'll never change (It'll never change)
Age ain't nothin' but a number (My age)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (Ain't nothin' but a thing)
This lovin' I have for you (Oh), it'll never change (Will never change)
Age ain't nothin' but a number (Age ain't nothin')
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing (Throwin' down ain't nothin')
This lovin' I have for you (Lovin' I have for)
It'll never change (It will never)

[Outro]
Age ain't nothin' but a number (See boy, I know just what you need)
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thing
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change (This love we have was meant to be)
Age ain't nothin' but a number (That's why I got to let you know)16Embed
