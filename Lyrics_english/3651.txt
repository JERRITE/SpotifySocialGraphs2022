[Intro: Agust D]
Everything in Dust
Do you see?
Well, well, well
Everything in Lust
Oh, what do you see?
Well, well, well
Who tells me that life is pain
Well, well
If there is a god, let me know, whether life is happiness
[Verse 1: Agust D]
The world of the world
If there is no confrontation and war in it,
A life that cannot be rejected
Injecting a morphine that capital is hope as a collateral
The wealth is infringed and tested
The rich are coveted even the poverty
The world only exists black and white
The end of the endless zero -sum game is worth seeing
The most ugly flower in the world of polarization
The truth has been eroded by a lie for a long time
Who is the most beneficial?
Who is the most damage?

[Pre-Chorus: Agust D]
Those who are not sick in the sick world
Isn't it strange because the mutation is treated?
Those who opened their eyes in the world with their eyes closed
Now it's not weird now.
Those who want to fight peace
Isn't it strange to the end of the ideology
Even though I have no dreams, I have no dreams
There is no correct answer. Isn't it strange

[Chorus: Agust D]
Everything in Dust
Do you see?
Well, well, well
Everything in Lust
Oh, what do you see?
Well, well, well
Who tells me that life is pain
Well, well
If there is a god, let me know, whether life is happiness

You Think You Got Taste?
Oh baby, how do you know?
I mean for god's sake
Everything's Under Control
Give me a few branches
Taste of capital control
People Talk
'My feed explains the day'
No matter how much money you have
The SLAVE of this system
Boasting busy dog ​​necklace and dog house
Who's fighting and fighting all day
Now you don't know
Oh baby, what's your name?
A flower that has already bloomed in polarization
The rounded hole in a square hole
Still, I roll it anyway again
It's okay at each chicken coop

[Pre-Chorus: RM]
Those who are not sick in the sick world
It's not strange to handle mutations
Those who opened their eyes in the world with their eyes closed
It's much weird to see my eyes alone
Those who want to fight peace
A joke that changes like a palm of the palm
Dream is a world that has become an option
There is no correct answer, that's the right answer
[Chorus: Agust D]
Everything in Dust
Do you see?
Well, well, well
Everything in Lust
Oh, what do you see?
Well, well, well
Who tells me that life is pain
Well, well
If there is a god, let me know, whether life is happiness 7EMBED
