Lyrics curiosity [letter of "curiosity"]

[Intro: Jay Wheeler]
Tell me about you, how are you? I would like to see you
In a photo I saw you and made me want to eat you
I know that, like me, in love you haven't had luck
But the desire to see you kill me

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler]
Curiosity kills me and I can't stand
I want to have you, just tell me when
Is that you and I know very well
Which is different when we eat (oh, yeah)
[Verse 1: Myke Towers]
Ey, me '
She and 'curious, a studious girl
The 'other' already has them furious'
The bathtub she puts her sparkling
I play it and leave it juicy
Poses, I portrait and put the 'wife'
Flore Marijuana ', she doesn't want Rosa'
If I don't do it in the cabin, in the float
Sees you 'beautiful
He gave me to see you but ahead
I know that it is different, I already checked your file
And it has no history ', how good it sees you'
Your gaze does not lie, call if it is' hot
And I am here, you always go 'through my mind (mind)
I didn't dare you, I know you can't see you (see you)
It is said there, what does not kill makes you more 'strong
If I was born again, I would meet you again

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler]
Curiosity kills me and I can't stand
I want to have you, just tell me when
Is that you and I know very well
Which is different when we eat (oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Jay Wheeler]
I would give anything to see you again (again)
Quiet, nobody has to find out
And I don't want to wrap myself, but I dare (I dare)
I have a long time to touch you
And what your outburst has crazy
And when I see your photo I blur
They say that I 'crazy' the one of us'
And they don't know what happens when I play (Yeah)
And I want to repeat, I want to feel you again
With you I bastard it, I'm not going to lie to you

That is different when we eat â€™(EH)
