X’s (Seth Hills Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Icona Pop]
I keep deleting X's when we message
’Cause I forget that things have changed
Now it's so different, now we're distant
But damn it, all of it feels so strange
Deleting X’s, I don't get it
'Cause part of me still feels the same
And I keep forgetting you're the X I can't erase

[Chorus: Icona Pop]
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
So tell me if you feel the same
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I don’t know what’s okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
But since you've been away, oh-ay
Been thinking about the mess I made
’Cause you're the X I can't erase, can't erase
Can’t erase, can't erase, can't erase...
[Break: Icona Pop]
'Cause you're the X I can't erase

[Verse 2: Pablo Bowman]
Now I'm deleting pictures, feelin' bitter
'Cause we're so happy that it hurts
We're still conversatin', but I hate it
And X's only make you worse
Deleting pictures, makes no difference
Remember saying thousand words
And I keep on missin'
I put you as the way you were

[Chorus: Icona Pop & Pablo Bowman]
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
So tell me if you feel the same
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
But since you've been away, oh-ay
Been thinking about the mess I made
'Cause you're the X I can't erase
