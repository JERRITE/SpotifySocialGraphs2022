Cabo Lyrics[Chorus]
Met a shawty down in Cabo and she a model
Got a villa by the beach, I feel like Pablo
Girl, your best friend choosy, you better follow
I'm just tryna fuck a redbone like Mulatto
Ayy, Nina, I can get you in the states without a visa
You know I need ya
Put you in the AMG, not a Bimmer
Let the chopper out, it singin' like Aaliyah
That Clase Azul hittin' out the bottle
I'm just tryna get behind it like I'm Five-O (Five-O)
Me and you, that's a crazy combo
Throwin' money in the air like we hit the lotto
[Verse 1]
Roll somethin' for your lungs, uh
Baby, we could do it 'til the sun up (Ah)
Let your guard down, put your guns up (Guns up)
'Cause we ain't gettin' any younger (Younger)
Say what's on your mind, don't make me wonder (Bitch)
Rollin' in the deep, goin' under
When I hit, I was thinkin' 'bout my ex
I even sent a text in the middle of the sex

[Pre-Chorus]
You remind me of a girl I used to be playin'
I know your love is dangerous

[Chorus]
Met a shawty down in Cabo and she a model
Got a villa by the beach, I feel like Pablo
Girl, your best friend choosy, you better follow
I'm just tryna fuck a redbone like Mulatto
Ayy, Nina, I can get you in the states without a visa
You know I need ya
Put you in the AMG, not a Bimmer
Let the chopper out, it singin' like Aaliyah
That Clase Azul hittin' out the bottle
I'm just tryna get behind it like I'm Five-O (Five-O)
Me and you, that's a crazy combo
Throwin' money in the air like we hit the lotto

Lamb' truck, I don't carry keys (Brr)
Got a Rollie sittin' on my wrist just like a parakeet (Coo)
I done threw away my Robins for Amiri jeans
Shit, I really made a mil' when I was seventeen, before I had a GED
Uh, 2 AM, slidin' in that Tahoe through Cabo
Spanish bitch in my Monte Carlo, vamos
Diamonds changin' different colors like iguanas
Stick tucked in my poncho like Chapo

[Pre-Chorus]
You remind me of a girl I used to be playin'
I know your love is dangerous

[Chorus]
Met a shawty down in Cabo and she a model
Got a villa by the beach, I feel like Pablo
Girl, your best friend choosy, you better follow
I'm just tryna fuck a redbone like Mulatto
Ayy, Nina, I can get you in the states without a visa
You know I need ya
Put you in the AMG, not a Bimmer
Let the chopper out, it singin' like Aaliyah
That Clase Azul hittin' out the bottle
I'm just tryna get behind it like I'm Five-O (Five-O)
Me and you, that's a crazy combo
Throwin' money in the air like we hit the lotto4Embed
