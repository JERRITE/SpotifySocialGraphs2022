Mean Bone Lyrics"I don't know, I don't... y'know"
"I walk out"
"No, I turn around, I ain't gonna forget about it"
"Oh, really?"
"He ain't gonna do that again"
"Y'know, don't let the man put you down"
"Forget about it"
"Girl, no way"
"Y'know, yesterday, know I had to..."

Girls
I got the boy whipped, flipped
Thinks I'm God's gift
With some porn style, sweet smile, out a while
I'm working it
Credit cards and fancy cars
I'm spending, pretending this dream is never ending
Got him wrapped tight, like a vice
My hard working man has me living the life
Here he comes now
Hey, baby
[Verse 1]
You're dissin' me
I never show it, but you're always getting into my head
Dismissin' me
I let you do it, but you're doin' it in front of your friends

I'm not your doormat
I'm not the leader of a kick-you-when-you're-down crusade
I want no part of that
I hear the rumors goin' 'round that I'm not a man

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of playin' dumb
I'm tired of being pushed around, yeah
And if you think that I'm goin' soft
Here come some hard times

[Chorus]
I got one mean bone in my body
(And one I wanna pick with you)
I got one mean bone in my head

"But baby-baby"
"But-but-but baby"

[Verse 2]
You are a parasite
You latched on and now I'm up to my neck in pain
All we do is fight
You bitch and moan so much, I think I need a hearing aid
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
My love won't overcome
The way that you put me down
And if you think that I'm goin' soft
Here come some hard times

[Chorus]
I got one mean bone in my body
(And one I wanna pick with you)
I got one mean bone in my head
(That tells me we're through)

"But-but baby-baby"
"But baby"
"But-but baby"
"But"

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I got one mean bone in my body
(And one I wanna pick with you)
I got one mean bone in my head
(That tells me we're through)
I got one mean bone in my body
(And one I wanna pick with you)
I got one mean bone in my head
(That tells me we're through)
"But baby-baby"
"But baby"
"Baby"
"But-but"
"But-but baby"Embed
