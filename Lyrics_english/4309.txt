The Lyrics letter [letter of "the letter"]

[Intro]
YEAH-YEH-EH, AH

[Verse]
You played bad letter
You have no value to recognize
What do I miss you
What do I miss you
Everything went to vacuum
I gave you my heart
Do not come to blame me
If you feel cold
The error was not mine
[Verse]
And so I became strong
I got up again and continued, I learned
And so I became a friend of time
And suddenly I understood that you weren't for me

[Chorus]
Who said I can't?
I do what I want
Now I am primam
I don't remember the past
Yes Gano or Pi–µrddo
At least I try
To the letters I do not play
Nerd

[Verse 2]
You have to understand
You are water I
Now I don't get out of my mind
Only with me I'm enough
You have to understand
From now on I am not afraid
I have everything long ago
I realize and I appreciate it
I give thanks to God
That no longer loves me
I learned that love no longer dies
Now I enjoy the sunsets
If you want to damage, look for other women

And so I became strong
I got up again and continued, I learned
And so I became a friend of time
And suddenly I understood that you weren't for me

[Chorus]
Who said I can't?
I do what I want
Now I am first
I don't remember the past
If I win or lose
At least I try
To the letters I do not play
Nerd

[Bridge]
I am harder hard than before
Hard hard than before
Hard hard, harder than before
I am harder hard than before
Hard hard than before
Hard hard, harder than before

[Outro]
