Almost (acoustic) Lyricsanoche I slept hugging the clouds
With dream pillows in a bed of illusions
I imagined this life
Crossing challenges to reach my sign
In an instant I lost all certainty
The doubts and the resentment were marked in my essence

Innocence almost breaks
I am exhausted all the strength to fight one more day
And I almost gave up (I almost gave up)
Until I thought about you

It will be a nightmare
It can not be true
I wake up a collapse
I start to slide

CHORUS
I almost finished faith
Love almost escapes me
I almost break the innocence
I am exhausted all the strength to fight one more day
And I almost gave up (I almost gave up)
Until I thought about you

When you only listen to your heartbeat
You will find between its rhythm and silence, the reason

CHORUS
I almost finished faith
Love almost escapes me
Innocence almost breaks
I am exhausted all the strength to fight one more day

Love almost escapes me
I almost stayed innocence
I am exhausted all the strength to fight one more day
And I almost gave up (I almost gave up)
Until I thought about you

And I almost gave up
But I thought of Testbed
