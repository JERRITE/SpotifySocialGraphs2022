Iâ€™m a Nasty Hoe Lyrics[Intro]
Thanks, Ugly God

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho

[Verse 1]
I made yo' bitch say, "Uh"
I put my hand on her butt
She said, "Boy, I'm on my period"
I said, "I don't give no fuck"
All I said was, "I'm Ugly God"
Now her pussy wet like a duck
Take advantage of me, bitch, I wanna be yo' slut
Face, titties, booty, and toes what I'm eating for lunch
Sit upon my face, baby, I ain't ate vagina in months
I'ma dip your titties in Kool-Aid, baby, watch how I lick it up
I'ma gamble witcha booty, baby, lemme try my luck
[Chorus]
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho

[Verse 2]
Ugly God A.K.A. Nigga Too Nasty
Come here, baby, put your phone number in my gadget
Little Dick Clique until they lay me in a casket
Young Ugly God toss yo booty like a salad
Same shoes every day, but, bitch, I'm still swaggin'
Motherfuck yo fashion, I could win a beauty pageant
Ugly God a legend, take notes in yo' tablet
I'm ugly as the fuck, but, bitch, I'm still a coochie magnet
37 booties in my face, boy what's happenin'
TV screen, shawty on the scene like an actress
My hair on point but my clothes stay ratchet
Young Ugly God, bitch, my dick game disastrous

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho
I'm a nasty ho, I'm a nasty ho

[Outro]
