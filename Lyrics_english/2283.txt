Space Makes Me Sad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look up from your telescope
Take me on this journey home
I don't wanna wait no more

Lay me down behind the moon
Tell me you'll be home real soon
I don't wanna wait no more
(W-wait no more)

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be dancing in the stars
We could be floating all away
As long as I'm safely in your arms
Then it don't really matter where we stay
[Chorus]
Cause, space
Space makes me sad
Cause, space
Space makes me sad
Cause, space
Space makes me sad

[Verse 2]
Feeling like pluto
You already knew though
I'm hiding just behind the stars but
How come the stars don't shine
When it's day?
How come the sky at night makes me this way?
Why're you so far away?
Galaxy castaway
Watching you hopelessly
Why aren't you home with me?

[Chorus]
Cause, space
Space makes me sad
Cause, space
Space makes me sad
(Space makes me sad)
(Cause, space)You might also like1Embed
