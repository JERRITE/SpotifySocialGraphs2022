Someoneâ€™s Disaster Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been searching for a drug like you
Breathing in that Pollyanna youth
Chasing down those melancholy hues
Cause i've been searching for a drug like you

[Chorus]
Oh it kills me and there's no denying that I can't shake
Cause I just wanna be someone's disaster
And I can't break but I know you're trying
And it kills me cause I just wanna be someone's disaster
[Verse 2]
You've been looking for a wreck like me
A perfect catastrophic harmony
Falling in and out of symmetry
Cause you've been looking for a wreck like me

[Chorus]
Oh it kills me and there's no denying that I can't shake
Cause I just wanna be someone's disaster
And I can't break but I know you're trying
And it kills me cause I just wanna be someone's disaster

[Bridge]
I've been searching for a drug like you
You've been looking for a wreck like me
I've been searching for a drug like you
Oh for a drug like you

[Chorus]
Oh it kills me and there's no denying that I can't shake
Cause I just wanna be someone's disaster
And I can't break but I know you're trying
And it kills me cause I just wanna be someone's disasterYou might also like1Embed
