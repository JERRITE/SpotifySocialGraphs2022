No love lyricsletra "no love" ft. Prince Royce & Bryant Myers
[Chorus: Prince Royce]
When you feel alone, baby
Can you call me I'm going to get
But don't get confused, baby
Let's enjoy as long as it can end

I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa ’
I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa ’

[Verse 1: Noriel]
No, no, Noriel
Baby I don't fall in love
Let yourself be carried out about what they are talking about
That I treat you pretty does not mean that you are stable
You call me when you need me
If you are going to fall in love, don't call me
Don't ask me if one day I loved you
That I am not for the arrears, fights, nor to claim

You are one of those
That he likes movie, jangueo and garments
You are one of those
That is not fixed or because the devil rebukes it

But calm I don't blame you
Because you and I are equal
Ask me for a desire and I fulfill it
It is more ask for two, na 'more tell me which

I know that you are crazy to want to fuck
You are the same as me, for that there is always a yes
Whenever you are alone, you can call me
But you don't get confused, it won't always be like that
You might also like you know that you like grass and five twelve
After he takes away, nobody knows her
She knows that this good
But for me that is not a problem

[Choir: Noriel, Prince Royce]
I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa ’

I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa ’

I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa ’

[Verse 2: Bryant Myers]
When you want I bury it to you
But I don't fall in love or cling
I am a dog
I open you both legs and close them
I don't have any fixed ass
My heart has a riddle
Do not talk me of love
The love of my life is my children
And I still have no children
You are one of those tipas
That they do not fall in love or make a treesomecito
Friend participates
We fuck and smoked Crup
You call me if you want me to roof you
And I crushed that culot
I'm going to give you until the jet boats it
With you I chingo acapellla, without protein

And I don't worry
I didn't know what my age was, when he knew
He was surprised, he wanted to put it completely to his mouth
But not quota
I bite her, La Lambo, La Chupo
If there is no lubricant I spit
She knows that always before doing so
You have to give me a suck

Baby I know that you are very good
But you are a drug that poisons
Chinga with whom you want
And when you call me for me, what do I put it in

Baby I know that you are very good
But you are a drug that poisons
Chinga with whom you want
And when you call me for me, what do I put it in

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
When you feel alone, baby
Can you call me I'm going to get
But don't get confused, baby
Let's enjoy as long as it can end

I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa '

I am not one of those who fall in love
Baby, it is not necessary to complicate
I prefer to spend the hours
Making you, kissing you toa '
