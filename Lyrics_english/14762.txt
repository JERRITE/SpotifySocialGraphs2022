That’s My Goal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know where I've come from
You know my story
You know why I'm standing here tonight
Please don't go, don't be in a hurry
I'm here to make it clear, make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you, no more
I've finally found that something
Worth reaching for
[Chorus]
I'm not here to say I'm sorry
I'm not here to lie to you
I'm here to say, I'm ready
That I've finally thought it through
I'm not here to let your love go
I'm not giving up, oh, no
I'm here to win your heart and soul
That's my goal

[Verse 2]
Please don't go
You know that I need you
I can't breathe without you
Live without you, be without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I've acted foolish
But I promise you no more
No more

[Chorus]
I'm not here to say I'm sorry
I'm not here to lie to you
I'm here to say I'm ready
That I've finally thought it through
I'm not here to let your love go
I'm not giving up, oh, no
I'm here to win your heart and soul
That's my goal

Well, I won't stop believing
That we will be leaving together
So when I say, I love you
I mean it forever and ever, ever and ever

[Refrão]
I'm not here to say, I'm sorry
I'm not here to say, I'm sorry
I'm not here to lie to you
I'm here to say, I'm ready
That I've finally thought it through
I'm not here to let your love go
I'm not giving up, oh, no, oh
I'm here to win your heart and soul
I'm here to win your heart and soul
That's my goal
That's my goalEmbed
