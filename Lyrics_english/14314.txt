Babe, Can I Call? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been finding it hard
To keep you out my head
And I can't sleep at night
She's on your side
Your side of the bed

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talking to her but she can feel it too
I can hear the seventy-five, you know it's our tune
She's speaking to me but all I hear is you
A flash back to a time when you still thought I was cool
[Chorus]
And babe, are you home?
And babe, can I call you?
I just want all
I just want all of you
I'm looking at her
But all I see is you
And babe, are you home?
And babe, can I call you?

[Verse 2]
You, you still need to get
The clothes you left
You left at mine
And I keep running through words
The words I can say
To put this right

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talking to her but she can feel it too
I can hear the seventy-five, you know it's our tune
She's speaking to me but all I hear is you
A flash back to a time when you still thought I was cool

[Chorus]
And babe, are you home?
And babe, can I call you?
I just want all
I just want all of you
I'm looking at her
But all I see is you
And babe, are you home?
And babe, can I call you?

[Bridge]
Babe, are you home?
Babe, can I call you?
I just want all
I just want all of you

[Chorus]
I'm looking at her
And all I see is you
And babe, are you home?
Babe, can I call you?Embed
