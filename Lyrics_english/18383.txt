Loyal Dick Lyrics[Intro]
When it comes to me, don't be stupid
You know I fuckin' love you, nigga
Yeah
Mmm
(We got London on da Track)
It's Rubi

[Verse 1]
That loyal dick gon' make me wetter, don't nobody know me better (Yeah)
Fuck your ex, I never sweat her, I'm the best, it ain't no better (Bitch)
I asked him if he fuck with me, he hit me back like, "Hella" (Uh)
Pullin' on these inches, pussy drippin' like a puddle (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get some top and then I dip, I'm tryna fuck, hе tryna cuddle
I'm not the wifey typе, I get my issue, then I dub him (Fuck him)
Damn, he got some length, he goin' deeper than a shovel (Damn)
Fuckin' with a bitch like me, I hope a nigga never fumble
[Chorus]
Tell your main bitch (Tell her), she the side now (Yeah)
Tell my main nigga (Tell him), he the side now (Yeah)
Tell your main bitch (Yeah), she the side piece (Yeah)
I told my main nigga, "Move to the side, please"
Tell your main bitch (Tell her), she the side now (Yeah)
Tell my main nigga (Tell him), he the side now (Yeah)
Tell your main bitch (Yeah), she the side piece (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
He got the type of dick that make a bitch wild out (Wild out)
Put the pussy on his lips, I'm like, "Bae, fuck you talkin' 'bout?"
Neighbors knockin' on that wall, they gettin' mad 'cause we too loud
Pussy got him pillow talkin' 'bout his homies, he a sellout (Damn)
He said it's too wet, he can't pull out
He got me impressed when he whip it out
Let's not fight over text, we should fuck it out
His old bitch mad 'cause her nigga got slutted out

[Chorus]
