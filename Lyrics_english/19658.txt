World Fall Down Lyrics[Intro: Lil TJay]
Lil TJay

[Chorus: Just Juice]
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Will you be there if I needed you? I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the waves crash down, I find my way to shore
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Swear I'd always believe in you, I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the tide come down, your actions set the score
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything
[Verse 1: Just Juice]
Yellin' when it all fall down, how long did you keep it from me?
Swear I'd always believe in you, guess my trust meant nothing
Took my heart and you bruised it, girl, I ain't stupid or Cupid
Ain't put nothin' above you, baby, how could you do this?
I’m lost as all hell, when I need a hand ain’t no one to call
I'm playin' voicemails, livin' inside these cold cell walls
Baby, if it all came down tomorrow, would you stay round tomorrow?
Play me like a fool for your love if that's what it's called

[Chorus: Just Juice]
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Will you be there if I needed you? I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the waves crash down, I find my way to shore
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Swear I'd always believe in you, I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the tide come down, your actions set the score
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything

[Verse 2: Lil Tjay]
If the world fall down, I'ma expect you to ride
I'll express my true emotions, they too deep in to hide
Any issue, call my number, I'll be there by yo' side
If you ain't ready for commitment, ain't no reason to lie
I'll be there any day, anytime, constantly you on my mind
I can't get you off it, I think life just giving funny signs
Just me and you against the world, world, world
I'm ride or dyin' with you girl, girl, girl
When I first met you, I had asked you for your 'gram
I had lowkey liked the fact that you ain't know me, weren't no fan, yeah
Looked at your fingers, weren't no carats on your hand
I'm like "Damn", I know I would try to wife you if I can

If the world fall down
If I went broke and lost my money, tell me would you stay around?
If the world fell down
Would you help or would you leave me in that water? Let me drown

[Chorus: Just Juice]
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Will you be there if I needed you? I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the waves crash down, I find my way to shore
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Swear I'd always believe in you, I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the tide come down, your actions set the score
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything

[Verse 3: Just Juice]
Now I’m
Finding my way I guess, look for the place I left
What I hear is togetherness, never for personal benefit
It's for the betterment, ayy
Till we lay beneath the settlement
Shawty told me all the secrets, I'ma keep 'em as part as part of our settlement
You hold me down? Sike
Swore you’d always be around, sike
Shawty know that I believe it, she kept me round for the hype
Prom queen (Prom queen)
Thought she all I ever want queen
I got a hundred on me and my cypher complete, that's why she want me
[Chorus: Just Juice]
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Will you be there if I needed you? I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the waves crash down, I find my way to shore
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything
Tell me when the world fall down, my body hit the floor
Swear I'd always believe in you, I ain't sure no more
Yellin' when the tide come down, your actions set the score
Tomorrow, nothing like yesterday, the present's my everything2Embed
