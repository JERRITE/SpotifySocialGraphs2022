Mattan (Remix) Lyrics [letter of "Matatan (Remix)" ft. Brray, Alan Gomez & Dj Tao]

[Intro: kaleb di masi & brray]
This is the Motherfucking Remix (Sheesh)
Matatán, double with the RA-KA-TA
A FANTASMEO AND PLAKATA (RRA)
Of three chacatá (Sheesh)
Problem ', there is no talk
'Tá Fuleteá' the plastic
"Juaka, the problematika"
Sympathetic and I handle the totica (prra!)
[Verse 1: Ecko]
When the party arrives, I always explode (e-e-)
Ey, that the eye 'are not noticeable
If there is sun, let's go boat, in the neck a bullion (ey)
She wants my chain '(pa' hang it on her neckline)

[Bridge: Cazzu]
No one does what I do
This is not cumbia, this is re nougat
Send the fuse that in the wick I go
The car on the floor with your chain

[Verse 2: Kaleb di masi]
This 'gile' does not put him
They have no stop 'moving the root
They offer me a thousand contract ', but teak does not come
They copy us the choreography, the offender are made '
If they only have bullets when it is not in front

[Chorus: Kaleb di Masi & Cazzu]
Ra-ta-ta, they don't kill me, I'm the Matatan
And your guacha goes down with the placata, rakata
And I have it in four as an animal, disassembly '
With that peco ass, I give it tra-tra-tra-trans (Cazzu, Baby)

[Verse 3: Cazzu]
And grab me harder, daddy, who feels strong
I gives me 'Turro, Guacho, well criminal
So much that they were made, I have them as a suitor '
I got more good and more than one regrets-you
Look everything I brought
Low more pa 'that you know my new tattoo
Put me back and put on espionage mode
That hurts me strong and you are this ass
Ra-pa-pa-pam, tra-ca-ta-ca-ta-ca, harder
He wants to give it and I'm not going to deny, hard
Vamo 'to sin with tent that was' dark
If I paint tonight I want me to '

Ra-ta-ta, they don't kill me, I'm the Matatan
And your guacha goes down with the placata, rakata
And I have it in four as an animal, disassembly '
With that peco ass, I give it tra-tra-trans (prr)

[Verse 4: brray]
Gile 'multiplica'o per thousand
The sheriff is bathed, what are you going to tell me? (NAH)
La Guacha is from Brazil (Wuh), what a piola, brought the Pill (tra)
Dry is to die, Jamaica and Chill (Sheesh)
Wachi-wachiturro, yours e 'photocopi (ey)
And you stayed for the floppy, that I like To ', there is no opi
To 'what I smoke and' exotic, classic to pavarotti
With the 'popi, with the' goti
Zion and Lennox, I have Moti (ah)
This is Easy even in my worst Crisi '
Pa 'you' is difficult for them to stop this very much (NAH)
Matatán like Wisin, don't look at the 'piercing
If I want to buy your whore, but in leasing (Sheesh)

[Bridge: Kaleb di Masi & Ecko]
And if you put in four I give the package
Movete-Vete, his eyelet-hex
Gap-out, people, people
To'a Hater, Hater, Run
What my time came (e-e-e-echo)
[Verse 5: Ecko]
Nad-Nad-Nadie does what I do (mmm)
This is not cumbia, this is re nougat (wuh!)
The year passes', but I am always (ey) undefeated to the Floyd (rra!)
And if this' gile 'does not put him, I make a ticket' from the seventeen
Edúquense pa 'that they respect
The family a day, the accounts a day
And to 'what Fronteo has my signature
"Turraka" in the Billboard (JA), Las Turraca 'in my bed (yes)
To all 'Lao' with Lo's Pana ', those who move the branch (Wuh, Wuh!)
The boyfriend 'tá jealous, toa' the night calls her
And she who answers him while I mama (oh)
I'm gathering pa'l corvette, but without bag and tie
Silver arrived, I have dating that I liked your cat (aha)
In my photo she kills (yes), a sad
It unleashes (ha) when smokeing from the plant and snatches (Ecko)

[Outro: Kaleb di Masi, Brray, Cazzu & Ecko]
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH-YEAH

The real 'already knows', baby

Ey, me ', Cazzu
E-e-e—
THE TRUE 'SON' 'E THE GREAT PUTA, BABY

They don't kill me, I'm the Mattan
