A good loser Lyrics [letter of "a good loser"]

[Verse 1]
I know you plan to leave, I already know
And I will not stop you
Do whatever you want

[Chorus 1]
However, remember that I
I will be here in the same place
And if you just feel like talking
I will gladly listen
And if he knew how to give you more love
He knew how to fill you more than me
Of course I know how to lose
Of course I know how to lose
[Verse 2]
You don't have to hide
Those tears are more
If you have to leave, go now

[Chorus 2]
However I hoped you will stay
But the water must be allowed to run
While I swallowed words I couldn't say
And if the wind blows in your favor
I will not keep you grudges
Of course I know how to lose
It will not be the first time
Today you go, tomorrow I will leave (I)
I will be a good loser
The world will not change
Someone certainly occupies your place

[Chorus 2]
However I hoped you will stay
But the water must be allowed to run
While I swallowed words I couldn't say
And if the wind blows in your favor
I will not keep you grudges
Of course I know how to lose
It will not be the first time
Today you go, tomorrow I will leave
I will be a good loser
The world will not change
Someone certainly occupies your place

Oh, I'll be a good loser
I will be a good loser
The world will not change
Someone certainly occupies your place
I will be a good loserembed
