2 are 3 lyrics [letter of "2 are 3"]

[Intro]
Nerd

[Verse 1]
I do not decide which is my favorite
Oh, cupid, arrow both I ask you
Balance, one on each side
There are team and I am a good game
[Verse 2]
Pulsations
I am sorry to beat more 'with two hearts
I have many more reasons with the fingers
To escape from this place, ah-ah

[Pre-car]
Better than two are three
The singular bores me
Let's try this time
The fate of odd
I want ... a ...
I want it all

[Chorus]
Better than two are three
The singular bores me
Let's try this VÐµz
The fate of odd
They are two, two are, two are three
Two are three
Better than two are three
The singular bores me

[Verse 3]
No, let's not effort
If you want to ask for reinforcements
While we combine breakfast with lunch
I have the recipe that changes the universe
If we all agree, we get very perverse
You Might Also Like [verse 4]
Come with me, I take place, friend
I want witnesses of this mess
I continue, I continue until the end
And so I get to my goal

[Chorus]
Better than two are three
The singular bores me
Let's try this time
The fate of odd
Better than two are, two are three
Two are three
Better than two are three
The singular bores me

[Bridge]
I carry more than one conquest, owner of the track
I have a perfect plan that sure does not resist
If you want to look, I invite you to happen
And when you prefer, you know you can join
Better than two are three
The singular bores me
This time

[Chorus]
Better than two are three
The singular (Yeah) bores me
Let's try this time
The fate of odd
[Outro]
I want ... a ... (I want)
I want it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohembed
