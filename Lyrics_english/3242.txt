Stay True Lyrics[Intro: Self-Provoked]
Yo, look

[Verse 1: Self-Provoked]
Finally I'm free I'm seeing shit more clear
Let go of fake friends, they be looking at me weird
Like I became big-headed 'cause of all this music shit
Nah, I just see you for the fool you is
Friends come and friends go
Some turn foes, some try to fuck your ex-hoe
Some remain smart and just let go
I walk a narrow path towards the light
Don't step on other's toes, don't try and start fights (No)
My satellite is picky, it ain't picking up yo' signal (Why?)
I see through you like a stabbed you with a pitch fork, I risk for
For the people I care about
You know moral [?] writers complain about life
'Cause you ain't living it right
Ain't towards progression, steady speakin' on lies
I stay-stay humble with a cookie that don't crumble
You remain-main focused 'bout that shit that bring us trouble
[Chorus]
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
Stay true to the heart

[Verse 2]
Finally I leave this people where they sleep, black sheep, not counting sheep
People tryna cloud me but me, I gotta be free like dreams of those who slept
I walk alone with some homies that I've kept
Not dealin' feelings, I ain't even 'bout to break a sweat
Over this bullshit scent, need change I give em cents
Mind like the moon still beautiful with dense
Positive I keep, like a picture in a locket
'Cause homies turn to foes
I watch 'em tryna knock it
I hope you hear me when I'm knockin' in yo' noggin' when I say all of the lights is shaded
Too much bullshit, that's why I get faded
Too much love dawg, just wait until they hate it
But I ain't even trippin', I'm pushing when I'm kickin'
Collecting water, when it's raining there's a positive to everything
Anything's worth creating, just know
They'll try to break it, they wanna see you failing
So keep that mind right, ignore the bullshit, rather daydream
When life gives you lemons just try and create a painting
Knowing that they're waiting, just so they can ruin it
Block that shit out like sunlight through an eclipse
Life is beautiful, it just depends on how you really live
Be real with yo self, 'cause they don't really give a shit
All you gotta do is trip on far you really get
All you gotta do is trip on far you really get
It's life
You might also like[Chorus]
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
Stay true to the heart6Embed
