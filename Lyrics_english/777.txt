Covered with you Lyrics [letter of "covered with you"]

[Pre-Caro: Rauw Alejandro & Lary Over]
Give it, stay a little longer
Teach me every moon of your skin (your skin, girl)
How daring you can be
I want to see
I just want to see (Yih!)

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Lary Over]
What will it be to undress?
I want to be the owner of your 'part'
Above you are going to get wet
Until leaving me covered with you (from you, girl)
Stay with me that is late (afternoon)
In addition to sex, I want to love you (Yih!)
Of your vo'a fluids, this is the Wason BB)
Until I was covered with you (and Rauw; Wuh!)
[Post-Coro: Rauw Alejandro, Lary over & both]
Make that pussy wet
Make that pussy wet, huh
Until I was covered with you
Make that pussy wet
Make that pussy wet, h (Yeh)
Until I was covered with you (the Wason BB)

[Verse 1: lary over]
What you want is to eat you all (all)
That while I do it 'listening' "all" (wuh!)
I halo your hair, I bite your mouth
You like to be spoken bad
Because it makes you crazy, baby (prr-prr; ah)
You have a model body, model
I get it and I arrived 'to heaven (it arrived' to heaven; hahaha)
You have 'boyfriend, but I don't tell you (no, no, no; huh)
If I knew 'that with you I die, I die, Yeh (I die, I die; Yeh)

[Bridge: Lary Over & Rauw Alejandro]
And do 'the 50 shadow'
I like in bed, as you name me '
He doesn't know what you and I do '
As in bed, you and I eat us' (Wuh-wuh!)
And do 'the 50 shadow'
I like in bed, as you name me '(You name me', Girl)
He doesn't know what you and I do '(hahahaha)
As in bed, you and I eat us', baby, Yeh (Yih!)

[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
In sushi bed, watching TV
Pa 'heat your pussy, I turn on a phillie
There was water damage to the armchair
I name my tongue
His name is "Poseidon", hey
Just Friends With Benefit
I'm already super saiyan three
Without taking off the y3
Loading it on top, I gave it (Yeh)
I didn't take off until it came
In the corner of the bed, my baby lost
And to 'what I lacked to do
Turn your hair and 'lip' bite you
I came to the world to please you
You still don't go
And I want to have you again (OH)
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Lary Over]
What will it be to undress? (No, Oh)
I want to be the owner of your 'part' (Yeih)
Above you are going to get wet
Until leaving me covered with you (from you, girl)
Stay with me that is late (afternoon)
In addition to sex, I want to love you (Wuh!)
Of your vo'a fluids wet
Until I was covered with you (from you, oh; wuh)
