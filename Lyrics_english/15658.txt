Life you have to live Lyricsvoy to send you a thousand bottles, my voice, to the sea
Wherever and when you have them choose one of
They. I have to say that I always loved you
Although in silence I could not say it

I was afraid and I still have it to move on
Or run away, find a touch, touch you
And if there are geniuses I would like a kiss

I never found the best time to approach
And shout what I feel, show you that
I can be the one you always dreamed of and I will be
I tried to be intelligent and not tell people
But I can't shut him up forever

And life you have to live and if it is next to you I leave everything
To live for you

I was afraid and I still have it to move on
Or run away, find a touch, touch you
And if there are geniuses I would like a kiss

I never found the best time to approach
And shout what I feel, show you that
I can be the one you always dreamed of and I will be

I was afraid and I still have it to find a touch, touch you
And if there are geniuses I would like a kiss

I never found the best time to approach
And shout what I feel, show you that
I can be the one you always dreamed of and I will be

And life must be lived might also likembed
