Get It Done Lyrics[Intro: OMB Peezy & King Von]
That you the only one
We doin' murder one
We gon' get it done
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

[Chorus: King Von & OMB Peezy]
Hope you don't think that you the only one (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this bitch, we doin' murder one (We doin' murder one)
Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (We gon' get it done)
Jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones (Ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one (You the only one, look)
Ridin' 'round this bitch, we doin' murder one (We doin' murdеr one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' gеt it done (We gon' get it done)
Look, jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones (Von)
[Verse 1: King Von]
Better think fast, nigga (Fast)
I got a bag, I'm on your ass, you done made me mad, nigga (You made me mad)
And if your homie wanna ride, he can go out sad with you (Go out sad)
I'm Picasso with the blick, I paint a bad picture (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
How you gangster and your bitch ass got fags with you? (You got fags with you)
You started rappin' and got killed, now they mad at you (Now they mad at you)
I tote them drums with that bass like the band with me (Boom, boom)
And sit your bitch ass down if you ain't gon' stand with me (Sit your bitch ass down)
Boy, I got bands with me, AK's, FN's with me (FN's)
Doin' hits alone, I don't need my mans with me (Need my mans)
I put that Drac' to your face if you playin' silly (If you playin', huh?)
And it's a lot of niggas dead 'cause they was playin' with me (Grrah, grrah)

[Chorus: King Von & OMB Peezy]
Hope you don't think that you the only one (You the only one)
Ridin' 'round this bitch, we doin' murder one (We doin' murder one)
Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (We gon' get it done)
Jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones (Ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one (You the only one, look)
Ridin' 'round this bitch, we doin' murder one (We doin' murder one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' get it done (We gon' get it done)
Look, jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones

[Verse 2: OMB Peezy]
Ayy
Ain't no one-on-one
He just got a Glock, think he the only one (Only one)
He was on the block until he got popped with a stolen gun
He came home, but he can't leave the house, he sold his soul for nothin'
Ayy, watch out for that lil' nigga Peezy, he'll fuck over somethin' (For real)
Get it done, bust a nigga head for that cheddar (Cheddar)
Don't give a fuck if you feel me, play with that bread, then it's whatever (Whatever)
Found out he fakin', now he fold up like some paper, we gon' shred him
I'm living better, brand new Mazi, finna wrap it with a sweater
Ain't gotta tell a nigga stop with all that talkin' on the phone
Must be snitching, nigga, you can do that shit there on your own
Can't sleep, can't eat, when it's beef, I get 'em gone
Gon' beat a fuck nigga to sleep up in this bitch, better watch your tone
Bitch, it's Peezy

Me and Peezy, we gon' get it done (We gon' get it done)
Jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones (Ain't no one-on-ones, nah, look)
Hope you don't think that you the only one (You the only one, look)
Ridin' 'round this bitch, we doin' murder one (We doin' murder one)
Ayy, me and Von, we gon' get it done (We gon' get it done)
Look, jump a nigga ass, ain't no one-on-ones
