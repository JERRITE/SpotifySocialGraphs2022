Undecided lyrics [lyrics of "undecided"]

[Intro]
Haha
J Balvin Man
Lalo Ebratt (his movement has me undecided)
Reik
Leggo (leggo)

[Chorus: J Balvin]
Whenever she dances like this
My head damages me
The day I met her
I took tequila and beer
[Pre-Coro: Reik & J Balvin]
And now I had it looking for it
A reason to see you dancing
I stole my heart without permission
Your movement has me undecided

[Chorus: Reik & Lalo Ebratt]
Whenever she dances like this
My head damages me
The day I met her
I took tequila and beer
And now I had it looking for it
A reason to see you dancing
I stole my heart without permission
Your movement has me undecided

[Post-car: Reik]
For those hips I am undecided
Your movement has me undecided

[Verse 1: Reik]
Of all relationships
With you I will never go to exceptions
But there is someone who is at this party
How much does it difficult for me to see it again

You are my dua lamp
Loose, mommy you know
That you are very rich
Giving it down
She doesn't take away
Chanel perfume
She breaks with her flex
And gives

[Pre-car: J Balvin]
She likes to look at her (look at her)
It looks like a film model (film)
She knows and I approached him
Why knows we are PPP
She likes to look at her (look at her)
It looks like a film model (film)
She knows and I approached him
Why knows we are PPP
Yeh ‚Yeh‚ Yeh

[Chorus: Reik, Reik & J Balvin]
Whenever she dances like this
My head damages me
The day I met her
I took tequila and beer
And now I had it looking for it
A reason to see you dancing
I stole my heart without permission
Your movement has me undecided
[Post-Coro: Reik, Reik & J Balvin, J Balvin, & Lalo Ebratt]

His movement has me undecided (leggo)
For those hips I am undecided
Your movement has me undecided

[Verse 3: Lalo Ebratt]
That look captivates me
Motivates, active, so it gives ‚that is wrong
Send reasons with your friend
I already saw your loss call

Victoria she is not a secret
That I like it '
That I understand you
Dolce your glasses, gabbana, so sexy
Chanel your perfume (you are always trending)

Sofia ‚Don't tell Lucia
That the other night I was seeing Maria
He doesn't trust her best friend
Nobody dances me like she would dance

[Chorus: Reik, J Balvin, Lalo Ebratt]
Whenever she dances like this (like this)
My head damages me (eat on)
The day I met her (Latin gang)
I took tequila and beer
Now I had it looking for it
A reason to see you dancing
I stole my heart without permission
Your movement has me undecided
