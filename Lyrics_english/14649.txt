Dreaming About Me LyricsNothing fits one part of radio-ooohh

Can you do me a favor
Promise me you'll say the same
Cause I'm digging you flavor
And I loved to hear you say my name
So tell me if it's cool if I lay on your bed tonight
I won't make a move girl I'll just watch you sleep
Hoping your dreaming about me

I wish that your love could fall down like rain
Everything you are is everything that a man could ever want girl
Baby I could just hope you'll love me the same
I won't make a move girl I'll just watch you sleep
Hoping your dreaming about about me
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh еh
Hoping your dreaming about about me
Eh eh еh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Hoping your dreaming about about me
You be looking so fly girl
The way the wind be blowing through your hair
I want to make you my girl
And when you wake up I'll be standing there
I want to be the one who's laying by your side that tonight
Ima catch you in my arms girl when your falling deep
As long your dreaming about me

I wish that your love could fall down like rain
Everything you are is everything that a man could ever want girl
Baby I could just hope you'll love me the same
