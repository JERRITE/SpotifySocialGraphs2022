TranslationsFran√ßaisGoddess Lyrics[Verse 1]
She gave it all, you gave her shit
She could've done just anything or anyone
'Cause she's a goddess, you never got this
You put her down, you liked her hopeless
To walk around feeling unnoticed
You should've crowned her
'Cause she's a goddess, you never got this

[Chorus]
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess, and you get a little colder
[Verse 2]
Finally surfaced above the downs
Feeling her boldest, she came around
'Cause she's a goddess, finally saw this
And now you're back trying to claim her 'cause she's gone
And now, without her, you are alone
'Cause she's a goddess, you should've saw this

[Chorus]
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Now you gotta live with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colderYou might also like62Embed
