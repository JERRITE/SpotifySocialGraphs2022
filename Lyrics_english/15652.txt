If you loved me lyrics [letter from "if you loved me" ft. Eladio Carri√≥n]

[Intro]
Tesla

[Pre-Caro: Maikel Delacalle, Eladio Carrion]
It has not yet been clear to me
If you liked it or if you like him
I want to know
Ma ', leave your impudence
That I want to see you, I want to feel you
Tell me what to do 'to do (what to do' what to do, what to do)
[Choir: Eladio Carrion]
Yeh, that you want Louis and Yves in Marseille
You want the movie, I'm not for your novel
Tell me if you love me, baby, tell me if it calls you
Oh, or at least tell me if you waxe me (if you waxes me)
When you left, I didn't want you to go '(outside')
You took to the food from the fridge (fridge)
Gucci, Louis, Fendi, all wallets
I wish you evil, like Zion and Cosculluela

[Post-Coro: Maikel Delacalle]
And if you really loved me (you loved me)
You finally decided (OH-OH)
And if for me, baby, ah (if for me)
I go looking for you on the road (road)
Baby, wait for me outside
That the other does not find out

[Verse 1: Maikel delacalle]
Every cemetery that you have '(which you have')
She is famous, she left in the CNN
Like his mai because he carries it in genes (in genes)
Vente with me, baby, that suits you (hahaha), ah
A lioness on the sheet, direct to the savannah
Of Mother Mari of Granduela Juana, UH
Hot blood like a Spartan (a Spartan)
How my Cuban moves me (haha)

[Post-Coro: Eladio Carrion, Maikel Delacalle]
And if you really loved me (you loved me)
You finally decided (OH-OH)
And if for me, baby
I go looking for you on the road (road)
Baby, wait for me outside (ah, ah)
That the other does not find out, ah
It has not yet been clear to me
If you like or like him
I want to know
