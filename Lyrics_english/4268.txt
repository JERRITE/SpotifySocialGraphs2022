There is something in you Lyrics [lyrics by "There is something in you"]

[Intro: Tito el Bambino, Zion, Lennox]
God bless you!
I! Zion, Baby
And the Lennox
With those who are abusing, more flow
More flow

[Saying: Zion, Lennox & Tito el Bambino]
There is something in you, baby, which leads me to madness
(Which leads me to madness, madness; Zion and Lennox)
It is difficult for me to believe that ours was just an adventure
(Which leads me to madness; abusing)
That there is something in you, baby, that leads me to madness
(Which leads me to madness; to madness)
It is difficult for me to believe that ours was just an adventure
[Chorus: Zion & Lennox]
Because I started missing you
Because I started needing you
Everywhere look for you
I want to find you, to be left with you
I liked how you looked
I liked how you perreated me
On the album I hit you and gave you, and I loved that
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you
Mommy, mamacita, baby, lady
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you
Mommy, mamacita, baby, lady

[Verse 1: Lennox]
What have you done to me, Bandida?
Where have you gotten, where are you hidden?
I will be waiting for you to decide
I don't know what I was doing, that you are now self -conscious

[Chorus: Zion & Lennox]
Because I started missing you
Because I started needing you
Everywhere look for you
I want to find you to stay with you
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you
Mommy, mamacita, baby, lady
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you

Gyal come back, don't make me wait
That I want to catch you

And hard to give you (hard to give you)
To bore you (Perrererte)
To whip you (whipping)
Pa 'punish you (punish you)
And hard to give you (hard to give you)

[Pre-car: Zion]
That there is something in you, baby, that leads me to madness
That takes me to lo-, that leads me to madness

[Chorus: Zion & Lennox]
I liked how you looked
I liked how you perreated me
On the album I hit you and gave you, and I loved that
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you
Mommy, mamacita, baby, lady
And now I look for you out there
Lost in the city, thinking about you
Mommy, mamacita, baby, lady
[Saying: Zion, Lennox & Tito el Bambino]

(With those who are, abusing, Zion & Lennox)
