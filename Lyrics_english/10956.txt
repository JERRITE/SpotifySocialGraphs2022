Make Your Own Kind of Music Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody can tell you
There's only one song worth singing
They may try and sell you
Cause it hangs them up
To see someone like you

[Chorus]
But you gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
[Verse 2]
You're gonna be nowhere
The loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough going
Just to do your thing is the hardest thing to do

[Chorus]
But you gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along

[Bridge]
So if you cannot take my hand
And if you must be going, I will understand

[Chorus]
You gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own kind of song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You gotta make your own kind of music
Sing your own kind of song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You might also like[Outro]
No, no, no, no
Even if nobody else sings along
If nobody else sings along1Embed
