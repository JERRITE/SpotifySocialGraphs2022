Friday Night Big Screen Lyrics[Verse 1]
Harry met Sally
She came at the table
Jordan Catalano put his lips on my navel
I'd never been touched like that before

Johnny met Baby
Then they started dancing
I thought I was Cher and I was living in a mansion
I’d never been lucky like that before
[Pre-Chorus]
Livin' it, livin' it
Livin’ it, livin' it in a dream
Livin' it, livin' it
Livin' it, through a TV screen
Now it's real
It's all happening to me
This is life in the movie
You and me

[Chorus]
I'll be your Buttercup
You can be my Westley
We can go drivin’ ’round
Lookin' all sexy
Friday night big screen

I’ll be your Christian
You'll be my Winona
We could take our clothes off
Ooh, Friday night big screen
Friday night big screen

[Verse 2]
Danny met Sandy
Like the pink lady
Rizzo and Kenickie
Yeah you know they liked it freaky
I'd never done something like that before
You might also likeKat kissed Patrick
Guess she got a hat trick
Bet they feel the way we're feelin’
When we're going at it
Yeah it's happening to me
This is life in the movie
You and me

[Chorus]
I'll be your Buttercup
You can be my Westley
We can go drivin' 'round
Lookin' all sexy
Friday night big screen

I'll be your Christian
You'll be my Winona
We could take our clothes off
Ooh, Friday night big screen
Friday night big screen

[Bridge]
Ooh
Friday night big screen
Ooh
Friday night big screen
Ooh (It's kinda cool that you want me too)
Friday night big screen
Ooh (It's kinda cool that you want me too)
Friday night big screen
[Chorus]
I'll be your Buttercup
You can be my Westley
We can go drivin' 'round
Lookin' all sexy
Friday night big screen

I'll be your Christian
You'll be my Winona
We could take our clothes off
Ooh, Friday night big screen
Friday night big screen

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
Friday night big screen
