â€‹religion (u can lay your hands on me) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's human, it's our religion
No preacher to teach us to love
Two bodies, one vision
No one's watching over us

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been talking on the telephone for hours at night
Whilst I've been thinking about kissing you
I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine
I know you're thinking about kissing, too
[Chorus]
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl
You can lay your hands on me

[Verse 2]
It could be LA, it could be Heaven
If you're an angel, can I be your God?
You in all your glory, it's not confession
Baby, don't apologize

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been talking on the telephone for hours at night
Whilst I've been thinking about kissing you
I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine
I know you're thinking about kissing, too

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl
You can lay your hands on me
You can lay your hands on me

[Bridge]
We've been talking on the telephone for hours at night
Whilst I've been thinking about kissing you
I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine
I know you're thinking about kissing, too

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me
Oh, girl, don't stop, please
You can lay your hands on me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl (You can lay)
You can lay your hands on me (You can lay, you can, girl)
You can lay your hands on me
(You can lay your hands on me)3Embed
