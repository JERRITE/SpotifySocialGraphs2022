(Call Me) Number One LyricsI picture the rain on windows
And I think of home
I wonder if you remember
Did you ever know?

Places I dream about
I will be getting out
Then I can follow the sun
You will be with me
I know you will give me
A hand to get everything done

Call me number one!
Call me number one!

Will I be afraid to tell you
That I'm coming home
I'm ready to take the highroad
I've been away too long
