[Enter: Nacho]
Chino & Nacho, Baby
Again your favorite duo

[Pre-Caro: Nacho & Chyno Miranda]
I knew it was crazy
That relationship that I had
I felt imprisoned without chains, it wasn't worth it
Because it was more toxic than Chernobyl
Toy Story's bad bear
It was my cruella and I was his doggy, and it hurt
[Choir: Nacho & Chyno Miranda]
Until you arrived
You took me to the moon
And between the crowd
I was getting stuck with your attitude
She is a shadow and you are light
Chinese (UH)
Until you arrived
You took me to the moon
And between the crowd
I was getting stuck with your attitude
She shadow and you are light

[Verse 1: Nacho]
The creature
You have to dart–µ the crown of queen, to her that of virus
You are a sun scratch that gives my skin color
She is Gamma, Rayoactivo Rayo
Active poison viper
He is malefic, with a bad and lost heart
Break what it touches like this or does not have a reason
For me to leave and do not come back
Until Venezuela recovers the Esequibo
It is cryptonite for a superman
There is no man who ends well from a relationship with Sam's daughter
Voldemort, you can't name him and if not Cata-Pum, Cata-Pam
Like the Hiroshima bomb
She destroys, kills, instead you give me life
Because I had no life

Until you arrived
You took me to the moon
And between the crowd
I was getting stuck with your attitude
She is a shadow and you are light
Until you arrived
You took me to the moon
And between the crowd
I was getting stuck with your attitude
She is a shadow and you are light
Yeah, this is called urban tropical

[Pre-Caro: Nacho & Chyno Miranda]
I knew it was crazy
This relationship I had
I felt imprisoned without chains, it wasn't worth it
Because it was more toxic than Chernobyl
Toy Story's bad bear
It was my cruella and I was his doggy, and it hurt

[Chorus: Chyno Miranda]
Until you arrived
You took me to the moon
And between the crowd
I was getting stuck with your attitude
She is a shadow and you are light
[Bridge: Nacho & Chyno Miranda]
Takes me to heaven (to heaven)
Every time I see her (I see her)
I have it and I don't believe it (I think)
My wish was fulfilled, Eoh
Takes me to heaven every time I see her
It's mine and I don't think so
My wish was fulfilled
Oh oh

[Outro: Nacho]

Chino & Nacho, Babyembed
