Spring Day (Japanese ver.) Lyrics [BTS "Spring Day -japanese ver.-" lyrics]

[Verse 1: RM, Jung Kook]
If you want to meet the words you want to meet
If you look at your photo of you want to meet
I don't have time to meet
Just pass
Due to blame yourself during the time
It's like winter, it's like a snowstorm even in summer
Trains with heart are already in the snow
I want to escape even if you grab your hand to the back of the earth with you
How long will spring days come, Friend?
[Pre-chorus: jimin, v]
Like a powder snow flowing in the sky
Like a powdered snow
If you can dance to you
I should get it right away

[Chorus: Jung Kook & J-Hope, Jung Kook, V & J-Hope]
Snow petal dancing
Disappeared
I want to meet (I want to see you)
I want to meet (I want to see you)
How much you think
If you count the freezing night
Hey, can you meet (Hey, can you meet?)
You can meet (you can meet, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Post-chorus: jung kook & j-hope, jung kook]
Until a gentle spring day telling the end of winter
Until the flower blooms
I want you to be there, as it is

[Verse 2: SUGA, Jimin]
Did you change? (Did you change?)
Otherwise I changed (I changed)
Endure when this flows
It will change again
I guess everyone is so?
Now that you are away
The feeling that I didn't shaken
It doesn't change, but let's break up now
Because it is not more painful anymore
You Might Also Like [PRE-CHORUS: JIN, JIMIN]
You're cold
Like this sigh like this sigh
Even though the accumulated memories still remain

[Chorus: Jung Kook & J-Hope, Jung Kook, V & J-Hope]
Snow petal dancing
Disappeared
I want to meet (I want to see you)
I want to meet (I want to see you)
How much you think
If you count the freezing night
Hey, I can meet you
You can meet (you can meet, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)

[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jimin]
You Know It All, You're My Best Friend
I'm coming again in the morning
Any night of any night
The end is coming

[Chorus: Jimin & J-Hope, Jung Kook, Jung Kook & J-Hope, V, *V & Jimin *]
Cherry blossoms bloom and winter is over
I want to meet (I want to meet, Ah)
I want to meet (I want to meet, AH-AH-AH)
Just a little (a little)
If you count a few nights
I'm going to see you (I'm going to see you)
I'm going to pick me up (*I'm going to pick you up, yeah, eh-eh, year, year*)
[Post-chorus: JIN & J-HOPE, JIN]
Until a gentle spring day telling the end of winter
Until the flower blooms
I want you to be there, as it is
