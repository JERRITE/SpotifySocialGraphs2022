Bugginâ€™ Lyrics[Intro]
Ssssh, (What!?)
Be very, very quiet, (Oh brotha!)
I'm hunting wabbits (Right)
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeeeeah

[Daffy Duck]
Clap your hands to the beat
Everybody just clap your hands to the beat
Clap your hands to the beat
Alright fuzz-face
Let's see what you're made of..
[Verse 1: Bugs Bunny]
Who got Bugs Bunny money? I'll give you some time
To get more carrots every time I rhyme
Can a mouse write this?
Does he have long furry ears like this? (Oh brotha!)
Can he make hits like this? (ha-ha-ha-ha)
No, it's like Jordan at the plate, you're likely to miss
Warner Brothers Inc. got bank, keep countin'
Rule from here to The Moron Mountain
Here's the game plan, listen up Tune Squad
Number one objective, beat The Monstars!
Shouldn't be hard, them guys ain't too smart
But to be sure snatch Jordan playin' golf
Even though he tends to be a ball hog
Hey Michael, over here superstar (whoo-hoo)
Who says the Bunny can't play above the rim?
Wait till they get a load of me, that's buggin'

[Hook]
Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'
Think this Space Jam go'n stop, you're buggin'
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
Who says the Bunny can't jam, you're buggin'
If y'all don't know who I am, you're buggin'
Bugs ain't the coolest in the land, you're buggin
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!

Got a gi-url-friend Lola, she's a fox
Ain't no bunny like the one I've got (that's true)
He-he-he-ehhhh, What's Up, Doc?
Bugs got more props than the Warner Brothers lot (twuee)
More money that any rapper's voice (twuee)
Since day one, had his and her furs
Like Trump's wife, up to my ears in carrots
Not even the barber can fade the rabbit (ssso what?!)
See, it's all good, cause Bugs got props
I'm a bunny, right? All we do is hip hop
Get around, (uh-huh) underground (uh-huh)
Keep it real, how ya like me now?
The bunny got flow, for one he got dough
On top of the world, me and my honey, Lo
So from now until the record stops (what?)
You guys can Bankhead Bounce, or do the Bunny Hop

[Hook]
Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'
Think this Space Jam go'n stop, you're buggin'
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
Who says the Bunny can't jam, you're buggin'
If y'all don't know who I am, you're buggin'
Bugs ain't the coolest in the land, you're buggin
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
[Verse 3: Bugs Bunny]
Ehhhhhh, what more can I say?
(The less, the better) I'm the coolest rabbit, Doc Holiday
I'll be your Hucklebunny, unmatched wit
I'm too legit, 2 Legit 2 Quit
Beat Swackhammer, ehhh, what's his gimmick?
Try to rule the world and every-ting in it
Run with the Tune Stars, show us love
Peace to Lola, Daffy, Elmer Fudd
The Road Runner, to rub a dust off
Peace to Wile E. Coyote and Fog Leghorn
Sylvester, Tweety, the rest of the gang (that'sss right)
On tree, the Tune Squad got the best game
And after it's over, we'll need a plan
What type of Mickey Mouse organization goes to Disney Land?
(Hmmm...I don't know) Bugs for president, when I got your vote
Time to cue Porky
A-blee-bleet-blee-That's All Folks!

[Hook]
Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'
Think this Space Jam go'n stop, you're buggin'
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
Who says the Bunny can't jam, you're buggin'
If y'all don't know who I am, you're buggin'
Bugs ain't the coolest in the land, you're buggin
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'
Think this Space Jam go'n stop, you're buggin'
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!
Who says the Bunny can't jam, you're buggin'
If y'all don't know who I am, you're buggin'
Bugs ain't the coolest in the land, you're buggin
Ehhhh, you'll be buggin'!

[Outro: Bugs Bunny]
So long Screwy
See you in St. Louey..
Been there, done that, got the T-Shirt..
I'm the only bunny that's still goin'
Know what I'm sayin'?...I'm out

[Daffy Duck]
That's enough of that!
Come down, selector, rewind...
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't sssss
Wait a minute, we're stoppin', what is this?
Oh, so that's what's goin' on here!
Let's all diss the duck!2Embed
