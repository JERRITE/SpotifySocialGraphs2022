Not Nineteen Forever Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam Fray]
She tried to peel me off the pavement
Tried to insinuate that sometimes I am in danger of going too far
Said, "would I like to go for tea and toast?"
Get your hand off my thigh
In the car, she turned to me and said

[Chorus: Liam Fray]
You're not nineteen forever, pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange
But things - they change
Older woman and a younger man
Both of them doing all they can
[Verse 2: Liam Fray]
Tried to get your attention all night long
Asked you once, I asked you twice
Asked you four times if you'd like to dance to that song
Front crawled the crowd, down the stairs
And then I followed you out in the rain, nowhere to be found
Never mind, you'll probably never look that pretty again

[Chorus: Liam Fray]
You're not nineteen forever, pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange, but things - they change
Older woman and ever so slightly younger man
God bless the band, they're doing all they can

[Instrumental Break: Daniel Moores & Liam Fray]

[Chorus: Liam Fray]
You're not nineteen forever, pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange
But things - they change
Older woman and ever so slightly younger man
God bless the band, they're doing all they can

[Chorus: Liam Fray]
You're not nineteen forever
You're not nineteen forever
You're not nineteen forever
It's not big, you're definitely not cleverYou might also like4Embed
