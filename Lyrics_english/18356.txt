(Ayo Beatz)

[Chorus: Wes Nelson]
Nice to meet ya
Stepped in, froze, freezer
Christian Dior (Huh)
Christian Dior, Jesus
Nice to meet ya
Fast life (Shoo), keep up (Skrrt)
Girl up on my side, diva
Hoppin' on a flight, see ya
[Verse 1: Wes Nelson]
When I pull up and flex (Flex)
Baby, why your man look stressed? (Oh, no)
Big drip in my Sunday best
If I put you in a foreign, baby, ain't no stallin'
You can roll with me, it's bless
Your energy
Freak in the sheets, lady in the streets
Melanin rich, she from overseas
Let me take you places in the world you ain't never been

[Pre-Chorus: Wes Nelson]
Girl, I could be the one if you want
When you want, come and say my name (Huh)
Pack a bag, we can run, do our ting in thе sun, catch rays

Nice to meet ya
Stepped in, frozе, freezer

Nice to meet ya

Said she got a man, I told her keep him as well
She tells tales (Yeah), even her girls (Yeah)
Think it's odd she don't leave as well (Yeah)
Alphabet love, know who we are
Kiss you from your feet, then I move up above
In the suite, now you can't move along
Kisses make you weak, but I'm here to make you stronger

Fly kicks, that's Miyagi
She said, "Come to mami"
J'adore quand elle m'appelle papa, yeah
Cartier, diamonds in your Cartier
Coca-Cola bottle shape
Likkle sip, I like the taste
