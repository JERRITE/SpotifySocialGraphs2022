​stardew Lyrics[Chorus]
Drive me like we daydreamed
To the edge of where you start
(Na, na, na, na)
Leave me in the afterglow
The dew of dying stars
(Na, na, na, na)

[Verse 1]
A storm is coming
I feel it in my scars
And in the morning
We'll wonder where we are
Nothing lies above
Nothing lies below
Leave me here floating
Oh, I will know, I know
[Pre-Chorus]
How you move
How you knew
Hold me down
Hold me true
How you move
How you knew
Your ever beating heart
Nothing seems so far

[Chorus]
Drive me like we daydreamed
To the edge of where you start
(Na, na, na, na)
Leave me in the afterglow
The dew of dying stars
(Na, na, na, na)

[Verse 2]
The world turns over
And I'll be lost in you
Hide and the static
Will push me through and through
And I will fall from your sweet height, to prove
That all I am is meant to bleed and bloom
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How you move
How you knew
Hold me down
Hold me true
How you move
How you knew
Your ever beating heart
Nothing seems so far

[Chorus]
Drive me like we daydreamed
To the edge of where you start
(Na, na, na, na)
Leave me in the afterglow
The dew of dying stars
(Na, na, na, na)

[Outro]
I know it seems far
But just be where you are
I know it seems far
But just be where you are
(Be where you are, be where you are, be where you are)
I know it seems far
But just be where you are
(Be where you are, be where you are, be where you are)3Embed
