Lifeline Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to bruise your heart
I'm so sorry I drove us this far apart
Drowning in a sea full of tears
I thought we could have lasted for years
And I still do
I wanna live my life with you

[Chorus]
So throw me, throw me a lifeline baby
Say that I'm really sorry
Pick up the phone
And show me, show me you really want me
Hold me, love me, need me
I don't wanna make this climb
[Verse 2]
Can you see how far I've strayed?
I can't believe that I'm still sane (Sane, sane)
Drowning in a sea full of tears
I thought we could have lasted for years
And I still do
I wanna live my life with you

[Chorus]
So throw me, throw me a lifeline baby
Say that I'm really sorry
Pick up the phone
And show me, show me you really want me
Hold me, love me, need me
I don't wanna make this climb

[Bridge]
People change and I can try
Expectations I will defy
Girl, I'm begging on my knees
Come on, come on, baby, please

[Chorus]
So throw me, throw me a lifeline baby
Say that I'm really sorry
Pick up the phone
And show me, show me you really want me
Hold me, love me, need me
I don't wanna make this climb on my ownYou might also like2Embed
