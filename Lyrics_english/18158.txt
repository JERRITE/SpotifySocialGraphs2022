Made Up Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know we just met
You don't know that much about me
Made up in my head and your character he likes me
Wouldn't call this love more like infatuation
'Cause you're going through your phases
And I'm not good with changes

[Pre-Chorus]
But just for this moment
Let me live in my head
Before ten years go by and you forget
[Chorus]
I'm walking down the aisle
You're standing waiting for me
Fell in love with your smile
Your brown eyes they adore me
I've got on my white dress and I'm not afraid of hurtin'
'Cause the truth is I'm in love with an idea and not a person
You'll never hold me tight
And you'll never kiss me sweetly
It keeps me up at night thrown back into reality
If only love were true and guys like you said "sorry"
Maybe this would work but we were just a made up story

[Verse 2]
Your lips speak the truth and my heart is yours to take
Ever trusting you would be my best mistake
'Cause every word is smooth when I'm looking in your eyes
I wonder what it feels like when the time is right

[Pre-Chorus]
But just for this moment
Let me live in my head
Before ten years go by and you forget

[Chorus]
I'm walking down the aisle
You're standing waiting for me
Fell in love with your smile
Your brown eyes they adore me
I've got on my white dress and I'm not afraid of hurtin'
'Cause the truth is I'm in love with an idea and not a person
You'll never hold me tight
And you'll never kiss me sweetly
It keeps me up at night thrown back into reality
If only love were true and guys like you said "sorry"
Maybe this would work but we were just a made up story

Feel you all around promise you'll never leave me
You won't take back your word
You'll always say you're sorry
'Til the day your back is turned
And the harsh truth hits me
It was never real just a made up story

[Chorus]
I'm walking down the aisle
You're standing waiting for me
Fell in love with your smile
Your brown eyes they adore me
I've got on my white dress and I'm not afraid of hurtin'
'Cause the truth is I'm in love with an idea and not a person
You'll never hold me tight
And you'll never kiss me sweetly
It keeps me up at night thrown back into reality
If only love were true and guys like you said "sorry"
Maybe this would work but we were just a made up storyEmbed
