Your eyes don't see me lyricssi you knew how I am suffering
To him know that I don't even have
Even a little about your love
And I look like you cry for him
Hoping that one day I will give you
Even a little about your love

And he just makes you suffer
And I'm dying to become happy
But you don't look at me
And he only causes you pain
And I'm dying to give you my love
But no, you don't look at me
That idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love
Idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love

And I love you so much
Your eyes do not see me
And I love you so much
I am invisible to you. (x2)

Your eyes don't want to see me

It hurts to see you cry for that fool
For an idiot who does not deserve
That your little angels
Spill a tear
And I with such love to give you
My whole life that I want to give you
For him you are one in the world
For me you are my world

That idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love
Idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love
You might also like I love you so much
Your eyes do not see me
And I love you so much
I am invisible to you. (x2)

If you knew how I am suffering
To him know that I don't even have
Even a little about your love
And I look like you cry for him
Hoping that one day I will give you
Even a little about your love

And he just makes you suffer
And I'm dying to become happy
But you don't look at me
And he only causes you pain
And I'm dying to give you my love
But you don't look at me

That idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love
Idiot, the one who humbles you that ignores you
The one who treats you so bad
And you, to that if you give your love
And I love you so much
Your eyes do not see me
And I love you so much
I am invisible to you. (x4) embed
