I have fallen in love with a fan lyrics when I go out to sing I see you there 
 You look at me and I start trembling 
 I go looking for you and I never find you 
 You always leave and I shout 

 Who offers me a solution 
 To fix my situation 
 I have fallen in love with a fan 
 And I can never find it 
 Who offers me a solution 
 To fix my situation 
 I have fallen in love with a fan 
 I ask here, I ask there 
 And nobody knows anything about you 
 I don't want to sing any more 
 I don't want to rehearse and I shout 

 Who offers me a solution ... You Might Also Likeembed
