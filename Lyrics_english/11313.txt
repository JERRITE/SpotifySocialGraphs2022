My Little Lady LyricsI think about my baby
A perfect little lady
I think about her shiny golden hair
I've never been a dreamer but every time I see her
I start to float away into the air
Oh
Oh
My little lady

You can make the sun and moon begin to shine
And if you could have your way every day would be fine
It's no wonder for as long as I may live
I will give you all the love I am able to give

I wake up in the morning without a single warning
Before I finish yawning she is there
I think about my baby
A perfect little lady
I think about her shiny golden hair
Oh
Oh
My little lady

You can make the sun ...

You can make the sun ...
