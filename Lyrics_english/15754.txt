Your divine memory [wedding version] Lyrics [lyrics by "your divine memory [wedding version]"]

Because I had lost, I have recovered it
Today I will keep your divine memory
It seems that I have you here in my arms
And I feel it was yesterday that I kissed you
I know that a long time has passed
But I keep your memory as honey
And everything I had lost, I have recovered it
All those moles that pass, with you
And because your kisses accumulated me
Today I will keep your divine memory
And the little that seems, I have stayed a lot
All those stars that I downloaded, that for you for you
And because your kisses accumulated me
Today I will keep your divine memory
Oh ohâ€¦
It seems that you take over my dreams
And I feel that I take you here on the skin
I know that our story was the past
But I keep your memory as honey
And everything I had lost, I have recovered it
All those moles that pass, with you
And because your kisses accumulated me
Today I will keep your divine memory
And the little that seems, I have stayed a lot
All those stars that I downloaded, that for you for you
And because your kisses accumulated me
Today I will keep your divine memory
It seems that I have you here in my arms
And I feel it was yesterday that I kissed you
And everything I had lost ...
Oh oh
Today I will save your Divinoyou Might Also Likeembed
