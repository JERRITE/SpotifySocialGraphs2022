Real Trapper Lyrics[Hook]
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
Been on the table, eight ball in the corner
Just bought the Beamer, bought lean on the corner
All of this money got it from the corner
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
Been on the table, eight ball in the corner
Just bought the Beamer, bought lean on the corner
All of this money got it from the corner
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
[Verse 1]
Im at the spot and no workin, no stoppin
Fuck talkin, Who coppin
You ballin, lets profit
Dont have to cock it, im prepared to profit
My cameras is watchin, unplugged in the socket
Might cop the Tesla or fuck it the Masi'
New widebody kit in that, motherfucker squattin'
Rockstar like Ozzy, my bitch is exotic
Im catchin my joog, nigga meet me on Godby
Bring me the cylinder, scale and the scissors
I look like a dealer, armed in here with killer
Thoughts of this shit, it ain't nothin to me nigga
I go through a hundred blue grands even quicker
I got the recipe
I know the specialty
Shave off a extra 3
I got a extra ki
Choppa is next to me
No thang could testa me
It'll be Rest In Peace
Fuck all the Jealousy
Loaded loaded fully, pro charger pullin
Want a show, book it
Want a ho who cook it
Ran off on ya mans, boy you know who took it
He was lookin crooked, but a nigga pussy
Hundred grands need stackin
Bitches call me big daddy
Bankroll got it on him
Nigga full time trappin (Get it)
