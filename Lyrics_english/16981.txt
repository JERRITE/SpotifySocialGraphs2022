We love the Earth, it is our home

We love the Earth, it is our home

Touch is move kgomu ya grace ya pushwa
Jwalo ka Queen Shakespeare ke nesa pula
Ka hara kereke ke rata hoba Modula setulo uzalo tshepa Jeso o be blessed
I call Thando airtime is on the move
Eat grace tlala fade away
Truth hurts devil I call spade a spade
You had your chance devil
But you blew the space away
Now am leaving you just gotta deal with it
I was wrong to think you worth it
My heart is torn apart apart ai
Millions of pieces all around me
But from the traps Nowadays am free
You lost leaf like single tree
Delete me on your phone screen
Devil, we are no longer on the same team
The end in a concert
Ke bona process
Mamela voice ya Jesus e re never mind
Jwale o ndumelletse hore ke o jwetse "Am righteous"
Ntse ke eme jwalo ka king!
Diproverbia 11 Verse 2
They call me skhokho la last clay in the pot
We praise God Pa ka mohau re sa phela
Like servant masterpiece of God man!
Enemies come to us just in case you don't know!

[Ariana Grande:]
Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

[Lil Dicky:]
Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon

[Ariana Grande:]
Have you ever been to Earth?

[Lil Dicky:]
Everyone who's listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here

[Justin Bieber:]
Are we gonna die?

[Lil Dicky:]
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not gonna lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out there who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid

[Ariana Grande:]
Unless we get our shit together now

[Music Video version:]

[Lil Dicky:]
Guys, everybody look into whatever the fuck Leonardo DiCaprio is always pushing, 'cause I feel like that guy knows more about... the Earth and how we're fuckin' it up than... anybody!
If the aliens did come, we should definitely send Leo as our guy, our rep
In fact, the profits that come along with the streams and the sale of this song are going right into the Earth
Let's raise some money for charity
Any words, Leo?

[Leonardo DiCaprio:]
This might be my favorite song ever
It's awesome

[Lil Dicky:]
Wow
Thanks, Leo

[Backstreet Boys:]
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Woo, hoo, hoo!)

[Lil Dicky:]
(Guys, thank you so much)Embed
