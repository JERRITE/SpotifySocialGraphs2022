All The Same Lyrics[Intro]
This goes out to you, lil 5'2''
Face all super cute
Yeah you had a man and I know he never knew
Skeletons in your closet we fuck in the living room
The living room

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day, you gon' be standing at the altar
Looking at your brand new husband
Talking bout how you been loyal like forever (Like forever)
And he know better, and I know better
Trade you in for someone better
[Chorus]
But these bitches all the same
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
But these bitches all the same
Oh yea, oh yea, oh yea
But these bitches all the same

[Verse 2]
All these hoes lose they glow its a right of passage
Some of these girls I used to know was fine but now they average 26 lost in the mix, bitch you not a savage
All them trips to the club bring a lot of baggage
When it doesn't work out then you get to trappin'
Posting half naked pics when you Instagramin'
And you always need a man thats a different habit
You gon' find a different man bitch I seen it happen

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day, you gon' be standing at the altar
Looking at your brand new husband
Talking bout how you been loyal like forever (Like forever)
And he know better, and I know better
Trade you in for someone better

[Chorus]
But these bitches all the same
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
But these bitches all the same
Oh yea, oh yea, oh yea
But these bitches all the same

One time for what never was but coulda' been
One time for who fell in love but couldn't swim
And now you got a house and it's just you and him
I know you look at him and know he's not as good as him

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day you gon' be staring at your daughter
Fighting with your baby father
Talking 'bout how he ain't loyal, bitch whatever
Bitch you should let him
You gon' get even then regret it

[Chorus]
Don't you know these situations all the same
Woah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
But these bitches all the same
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

This goes out to you, lil 5'2''
Face all super cute
Yeah you had a man and I know he never knew
Skeletons in your closet we fuck in the living room
The living room
Like forever
He know better

Like forever

Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh2Embed
