Lyrics lovers [letter of "lovers" ft. Mike Bahia]

[Bridge: Greeicy, Mike Bahia]
If ours is not right
Without wanting one falls in love
If with you I spend it well
So for a couple of hours (for a couple of hours alone)

[Verse 2: mike bahía]
(Mike Bahia)
We are lovers, innocent of what we are feeling
Let's have a secret, and nobody knows that
Makes it more interesting, I know
Turn off the cell phone, nobody bothers us
Where nobody finds us I'm going to take you
[Choir: Greeicy, Mike Bahia, both]
Lovers
Although we belong to different beds
Even if people judge
We are lovers
Although we belong to different beds (different beds)
People no matter

[Bridge: Greeicy & Mike Bahia, Mike Bahia]
If ours is not right (it's not right)
Without wanting one falls in love (unintentionally one falls in love)
If with you I spend it well (know 'that I spend it well)
So for a couple of hours (for a couple of hours, alone)

[Verse 3: Greeicy & mike bahía, both]
Who are they to judge us?
I know that it sounds a little crazy, but with you spend well
If they ask me why I did
He filled my gray afternoons
And to the heart who contradicts it?, Yeah-eh
What if I ask you to be my baby
Power forever to have it
You know I want but
Fate made us-

[Choir: Greeicy, Mike Bahia, both]
Lovers
Although we belong to different beds
Even if people judge
We are lovers
Although we belong to different beds (different beds)
People no matter

If with you I spend it well (I spend it well)
So for a couple of hours
(For a couple of hours, alone)
If ours is not right (it's not right)
Without wanting one falls in love (unintentionally one falls in love)
If with you I spend it well (know 'that I spend it well)
So for a couple of hours (even for a couple of hours, Yeah, EH)
