Hazy Lyrics[Verse 1: Chloe]
I know you like
Just what you see when I walk by
You take your time
And you trouble my world with the look in your eyes
Your smile is like
The first rain out of the summertime
Your soul is kind
My, my, my

[Pre-Chorus: Halle]
You know that I love our long nights
You starin' at my pretty brown eyes
And I can see you bein' polite
But come on baby take a long bite, bite
[Chorus: Chloe & Halle, Chloe]
You fallin' for me, baby
I know I make you crazy
Like when the clouds are hazy
You like to smell my daisies (Oh, oh)
I can see that you wanna (Oh, oh)
I smell on your cologne (Oh, oh)
Be tough now don't be lazy (Oh, oh)
Come love me like you hate mе (Oh)

[Post-Chorus: Chloe with Halle]
Love me like you
Lovе me like you hate me
Love me like you
Love me like you hate me
Touch me like you
Touch me like you hate me
Love me like you
Love me like you hate me

[Verse 2: Halle]
Little aggression
It always sets my heart on fire
I pay attention
Yeah, don't be shy, know it's in you like knives
You have permission
To shake my world 'til it falls down
Then pick me back up
Don't you know you're my guy?

You know that I love our long nights (Oh, oh)
You starin' at my pretty brown eyes (Oh, oh)
And I can see you bein' polite (Oh, oh)
But come on baby take a long bite, bite (Bite)

[Chorus: Chloe & Halle]
You fallin' for me, baby
I know I make you crazy
Like when the clouds are hazy
You like to smell my daisies (Oh, oh)
I can see that you wanna (Oh, oh)
I smell on your cologne (Oh, oh)
Be tough now don't be lazy (Oh, oh)
Come love me like you hate me

[Bridge: Chloe]
Hate me
It's okay, baby
If you love a little too hard for me
For me
Kiss me little harder, little harder now
Touch me little harder like woo
Kiss me little harder, little harder now
Oh, oh-oh
[Outro: Chloe, Halle & Both]
Love me like you, love me like you
Come on baby take a long bite, bite
Hate me
Fallin' for me, baby (Fallin' for me)
Like when the clouds are hazy
(When they hazy, when they hazy, when they hazy)
I can see that you wanna
(I know you wanna, I know you wanna, I know you, know you wanna, wanna)
Be tough now don't be lazy (No)
Come, love, love5Embed
