Forever I will love you LyricsNunca I thought that when I looked into my eyes
I would know what is living
Think that I have seen everything and I never saw you come
Put aside, to be for you
Today I know that
The desire I had lost
They have returned because all my life
Here I always waited for you
I never wanted to look for you in my eyes
Whom someone else
I could have had your place
It has always been yours, I could be wrong
And now, I feel that I have already found you
I invite you to give my hands, so we can be
You will have thousands of promises for your love
Me
I will fly
For all heavens and defend
Your love for the ocean and I will swear
That nothing will hurt you just kiss me
That by your side, I will live
Day and night just to be
Guardian from your hobbies I want to protect
That you have that passion every day
Who I fell in love
In every second and minute I will live for you
Taking in gutter that I always wanted it that way
Telling you stories that make you laugh
I can, love you more than I think
I know and I'm afraid, that one day I can explode
I swear for my part
That nobody can make me change
The way I love you and I'm going to respect you
I have it very clear, it will only happen
My life, it will be better that day
The day you decide
And come to fight for me
You will have, thousands of
Promises to love, me !!
I will fly
For all heavens and defend
Your love for the ocean and I will swear
That nothing will hurt you only kiss me
That by your side, I will live
Day and night just to be
Guardian from your hobbies I want to protect
That you have that passion every day
Who I fell in love
Also
I beg you to apologize for the late
I swear I was looking for, but I didn't find you
For years I cried and now look
I don't think losing
And come
The moon and stars have to know
That every night you have to belong
To this your universe, that I will give it to you
