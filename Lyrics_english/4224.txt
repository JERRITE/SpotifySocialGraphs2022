Your face is perfect
Your intercom body
Your open look
Also your way of walking
The night is good
Today I'm going to take you
Go preparing
That today you are going to scream

Your face is perfect
Your intercom body
Your open look
Also your way of walking
The night is good
Today I'm going to take you
Go preparing
That today you are going to scream

That sympathy yours
What a lot of laughs you give me
How flirtatious
How perfect your waist
What anciety of mine
What a despair for playing
What a precious mouth
That today I want to kiss her

And dance as a goddess as if they didn't see her
The hair is released and a whole beast is done
Make a spell tonight I would like
That was me the dam
May your mouth bit
And he is dancing smoothly like a spelling to the moon
The spells that take you to the heights scare
She is the cat that attacks you on the dark night
Pure substance, my feveraaaaaaaa

Since that time I kiss her
Beyond what I did not find
That time that a kiss steals
It was when I realized that

Since I saw you you stole my attention
