Florida Blues Lyrics[Chorus]
Sun is shining, skies are blue
I got a better view, crawling the avenue down in Florida
Sun is shining, feels so cool
I'm never coming down, chasing another cloud

[Verse 1]
Meet me at the Western Union
Don't give me excuses, bruises
And a burner phone
Cruising, driving down the wrong dream
Billboard Jesus and a gun, I don't belong
Tell Hollywood you won
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, I know, I know we won't make it
I know, I know, but we're beautiful, beautiful
Like the broken stars
Oh baby, I know, I know we gon' make it
You know, you know, we're beautiful, beautiful
Tell me I ain't wrong

[Chorus]
Sun is shining, skies are blue
I got a better view, crawling the avenue down in Florida
Sun is shining, feels so cool
I'm never coming down, chasing another cloud

[Post-Chorus]
Got the Florida blues
(How many? How many?)
Got the Florida blues
(How many? How many?)
I got Florida blues, blues
I got

[Verse 2]
Young thing, sipping on white lightning
Slipping on some tight thing, gold rings
I'm a fucking star
Sleeping on the same floor, suitcase at the bus stop
Locked out in the rain again, council estate
But darling I want more
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, I know, I know we gon' make it
You know, you know, we're beautiful, beautiful
Tell me I ain't wrong
One way ticket in my empty pocket, and a pure high
Pure high, leave it all behind

[Chorus]
Sun is shining, skies are blue
I got a better view, crawling the avenue down in Florida
Sun is shining, feel so cool
I'm never coming down, chasing another cloud

[Post-Chorus]
Got the Florida blues
(How many? How many? Many)
Got the Florida blues
(How many? How many? Many)
I got Florida blues, blues
I got

[Outro]
Crush it, cut it, cook it, hook it up
Put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth, baby, baby
Crush it, cut it, cook it, hook it up
Put it in my mouth
Put it in my mouth, baby, baby5Embed
