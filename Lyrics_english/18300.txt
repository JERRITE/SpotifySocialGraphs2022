Like Tu Danz Lyrics[Hook: Kida Kudz]
Step, step in the party
You know I got gyallies on my left and right
And i'm sippin' on the Henny
Plus i'm tryna get right
With a couple peng tings
Half black, half white
I don't wanna be a player
(Juls, baby)

[Verse 1: Ms Banks]
Stepped in looking like a peng ting
Bout to catch a body on sight
I don't wanna be a player but I can be your girl for the night
(One night only)
Thick hips, thick lips
And you know seh the pum-pum tight
I don't wanna smoke no more but someone better pass me the light
How you feel?
Bout to make a mill, cah your girl a big deal
This is COD everything straight kill
One day I might sing, other days I do drill
Man, I make these niggas act up
Never used to give a fuck
Now you're catting for my love
Babe I need to get these racks up
Have a man causing injuries to get into me
Ooh
[Hook: Kida Kudz]
Step, step in the party
You know I got gyallies on my left and right
And i'm sippin' on the Henny
Plus i'm tryna get right
With a couple peng tings
Half black, half white
I don't wanna be a player
I'm looking for a wife

[Chorus: Kida Kudz]
We like to dance, we like to denge, we like to bounce
We like to dance, we like to denge, we like to bounce
We like to dance, we like to denge, we like to bounce
We like to dance, we like to denge, we like to bounce
