Caleidoscopic Lyricsno I could or look at my face I felt bad 
 I pointed to cry 
 Try not to be noticed 
 And the heart of such accelerated wanted to jump 
 From my chest walk after you 
 I was slowly without saying anything 
 I let you go 

 Love is so kaleidoscopic alters reality 
 Always leave your hypnotic trauma when you go 
 Every day they seem equal 
 Since you are not 
 I don't know how to land 
 What started being just a game gets outsourly 

 Love is so kaleidoscopic alters reality 
 And leaves us behind his hypnotic trauma when he leaves 
 Love is so kaleidoscopic that reality alters 
 It has great hallucinogen and so 

 I diminish the moon and change my luck you need already 

 Love is so kaleidoscopic alters reality 
 Always leave your hypnotic trauma when you go 
 Love is so kaleidoscopic alters reality 
 It has great hallucinogen and so
