Creepin N Lurkin Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah-yeah (Virus)

[Chorus]
We out here creepin', out here lurkin'
We gon' find you
We bald like Caillou but we silent and we violent
We creepin' and lurkin', we creepin' and lurkin'
We creepin' and lurkin', nigga
We creepin' and lurkin', we creepin' and lurkin'
We creepin' and lurkin', nigga
We out here creepin', out here lurkin'
We gon' find you
We bald like Caillou but we silent and we violent
We creepin' and lurkin', we creepin' and lurkin'
We creepin' and lurkin', nigga
We creepin' and lurkin', we creepin' and lurkin'
We creepin' and lurkin', nigga
[Verse]
I'm creepin' and lurkin'
You niggas deserve it and murder's my purpose (Yeah-yeah)
If you hang with the serpents you niggas go first
And it's $aber they worship (Yeah-yeah)
I've been through the darkest, I've battled the hell
I've been through the torment (Yeah-yeah)
Them niggas ain't worth shit (Yeah-yeah)
So I'm bringing the torture
I travelled through the portals, my flow is immortal
I come through and rip his body in half, like he got a divorce, yeah
You wrecking my force, yeah, we gonna crash on your corpse
Finish the mission, abort, fuck nigga, that's a chorus
Killin' niggas on a court, fucking bitches in my fort
Nigga, play a different sport 'fore we put you in dirt
Clip with a nigga, we endin' your days
I will never change, I'm stuck in my ways
My niggas ain't ducking, we coming abide
Talk about how I deal with the pain
Talk about fashion, these niggas all stains
Niggas don't want pain, you but don't want a gang of niggas
That would hang a nigga in a second
Pussy niggas need a weapon, pussy nigga what you reppin'?
Get lil' pussy and stretch it, or do you think disrespectful?
Your time is up, just accept it
