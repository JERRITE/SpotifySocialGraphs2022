0 feelings (remix) Lyrics [letter of "0 feelings (remix)" ft. Lyan, Messiah, Darkiel, Noriel & Baby Rasta]

[Pre-Caro: Baby Rasta & Jenny "The Sexy Voice"]
(This is the remix)
I gave a trusted one, I fell in love and in his game I fell
The second came with the same (High Quality on the Beats)
She lied to me and I also lied
That is why I am a child and thanks to this whore was that I learned
Damn is the man who trusts a woman and now I'm like this

[Chorus: Baby Rasta & Jon Z]
A with me played and now with to'a I play (with to'a yo I play)
In my heart there is no love, I don't believe in feelings
One with me played and now with to'a I play (Yeah)
In my heart there is no love, I do not believe in feelings (mere, I am a bastard; Jon Z, man)
[Verse 1: Jon Z & Noriel]
Yeah
I am a bastard, I hit them to'a
I threw myself, I threw the other (ah)
Mor mine, Mai ', is that I enclosed me (enzyme)
Be with it, I love them to to'a (Yeah)
I throw them fat, I throw them Slender (Yeah)
I threw me the Doña, with her you learn (ah)
I don't know if you understand me, and I am a fucking
Mommy, he understands, I'm a prostitute
I fall in love with them, I get them into
To get obsessed and give me my ass (JA)
I let them be left of the boyfriend Fatulo (haha)
And I don't want them after ejaculum
I make cards, I write poems (haha; ah)
And to the 'weeks' toy with another baby
I make them cry (ah), they make me a scene
But speaking of course, I don't feel sorry for me (no-no, Noriel)

[Verse 2: Noriel]
I fall in love (no), if I was born alone, I die alone (aha)
That is why before they make tricks, first the 'use and then the' ignoro (haha)
One took me from asshole, but with that nobody stays (nobody)
And because of that daughter of a bitch I did not leave myself and I took them from asshole '(ah, ah)
In no woman is trusted
They are diablas of nights and demons by day
That's why I always stop at mine
I put it and send them to follow where they came (Wuh!)
I put it on and then I don't even call them (Ajá)
Pa 'win I say to "I love you"
After I come, we check
Sorry, if you thought I was going to grab your hand

(Lyan)
One with me wanted to play (play), because I wanted to play with three (shit)
A daring I loved me enchular (enchular?), For I wanted to enchular the 'three
One era peleona (What?), The other is mounted on missions
One looks rubber, shouts when it goes down and looks out
And I don't fall again (Nah)
I keep whores and power (power)
That they live from assuming (yes)
Because they won't have what I have and what I'm going to have (rrra)
I have it as a puppet
Calling for it to put it on and it 'compromises
Looking for Seueta, I'm Saiyan Vegeta
And what wants to try me because it is dry (Wuh!)
With an echo the Mañanero (Mañanero)
With the other I am the core
Sometimes I get desperate
But chicho whenever I want, so, what do I complain? Oh shit (Lyan)

[Chorus: Darkiel & Jon Z]
One with me played and now with all I play (you know who I am)
In my heart there is no love, I have no feelings (nah)
One with me played and now with all I play (hey, baby, your time is over now e 'mine)
In my heart there is no love, I have no feelings (hey)

[Verse 4: Darkiel]
A with me became funny (haha)
I gave my love, chocolates and roses (devil)
And with everything and that, she had no limit
He made one, because I made the remix (well take, haha)
With one, with do ', with four, with six (haha)
Doo 'Threesome' and Fumamo 'Haze (Yeah)
Since I released her everyday
In my room there is more action than in Gray's (Jah)
That's why I don't think about her and now I always have
Four chamaquitas that in the face me'- (haha)
I write the same text and send it to To'a (Baby)
So they get quickly and get wet to'a
[Verse 5: Messiah]
(Messiah)
One with me played (-Gó), I took away because I never played (-gué)
They say that men are bad '(bad')
And in this return it was I who fell in love (Yeah)
I fell in love like a pigeon (pigeon)
I left a bad di'que because I was a chrome (chrome)
Now I don't have a good Mocione '(oh)
Now don't talk to me about relative '(no)
One with me played and now with all I play
In my heart there is resentment, I no longer have feelings
Don't talk to me about feelings (no)
Because I have zero (zero) from that pod
I just talk about money (-nero)
And not leather, I have the heart of steel (steel)

[Pre-Caro: Baby Rasta]
I gave a trusted one, I fell in love and in his game I fell
The second came with the same
She lied to me and I also lied to her (I also lied to her)
That is why I am a child and thanks to this whore was that I learned
Damn is the man who trusts a woman and now I am like that (and now I am like that)

[Chorus: Baby Rasta & Messiah]
A with me played and now with to'a I play (with to'a yo I play)
In my heart there is no love, I no longer have feelings (I have feelings)
A with me played and now with to'a I play (with to'a yo I play)
In my heart there is no love, I no longer have feelings

[Outro: Darkiel, Jon Z, Noriel, Lyan,*Messiah*& ** Baby Rasta **]

No-no, Noriel
