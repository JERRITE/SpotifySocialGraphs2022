No limitations Lyrics[Chorus]
It's a different day, man what could I say, and I've been patient
Yeah but anyway, they be in the way, can't stop my greatness
Yeah we’re on the way, what you gonna say? No Limitations
Watch me get away, watch me get away up on my spaceship
It's a different day, man what could I say, and I've been patient
Yeah but anyway, they be in the way, can't stop my greatness
Yeah we’re on the way, what you gonna say? No Limitations
Watch me get away, watch me get away up on my spaceship
They can say what they wanna
That won't change what I thought of
That won't change what I'm made of
On my way see you later
Every day getting greater, every day, every summer
I don't wait, I don't wanna, that's one k, that's one hunna
Every day on the come up, make a way yeah I’m gonna
They can say what they wanna
Nah, that won’t change what I thought of
That won't change what I'm made of

[Verse]
Hey, I know the truth, yeah
It's all in me and all in them, and all in you, yeah
Now tell me what you really, really wanna do, yeah
I can tell you that I'm doing what I wanna do, yeah
I can tell you that the sun is where I'm running to, yeah
I can tell you that my soul is all 100 proof, yeah
I can tell you that I'm going way, going way up
Tell them I don't hear them, I don't hear them say stuff
