Color Esperanza Lyrics [Lyrics for "Hope Color"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 I know there are in your eyes just looking 
 That you are tired of walking and walking 
 And walking always turning in a place 
 I know the windows can be opened 
 Changing the air depends on you 
 It will help you, it is worth once again 

 [Chorus] 
 Know that you can want you to 
 Remove your fears out of them outside 
 Painting the face with hope color 
 Tempt the future with the heart 
 [Verse 2] 
 It is better to get lost than ever embark 
 Better try to stop trying 
 Although you see that it is not so easy to start 
 I know the impossible can be achieved 
 That sadness will one day go 
 And so life will change and change 

 [Chorus] 
 You will feel that the soul flies 
 For singing once again 
 It is better to shine 
 That just seek to see the solyou might also like1embed
