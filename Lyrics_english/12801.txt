Things You Make Me Do Lyrics[Intro: Robin Thicke]
The things you make me do (Ooh, ooh, ah babe, oh darling, oh no)
The things you make me do
The things you make me do
The things you make me do

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
I think every part of me, is addicted to your touch
'Cause everything I got inside of me, got me needin' you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Ashanti]
Hey
Got me open, got me coastin', got me floatin', babe
Got me jonesin', got me zonin', got me coin' crazy
Boy, I'm shakin', body achin', got me waitin', babe
These are all the things, the things you make me do
[Chorus: Ashanti]
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
I'll wash your dishes, blowin' kisses in the bubbles, babe
I'll be your bad girl that loves to get in trouble, babe
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
Take you shoppin' for some [?], buy you'll jewelry, babe
And all my friends they think I'm crazy, the things you make me do

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Voice soft, the crazy hoarse (Can't get on the floor?)
Private performance, I'm beggin' - beggin for more
You're so naughty and nice, you're so naughty and nice
Run Ashanti, run, you know I wanna chase it

[Pre Chorus: Ashanti]
Got me open, got me coastin', got me floatin', babe
Got me jonesin', got me zonin', got me coin' crazy
Boy, I'm shakin', body achin', got me waitin', babe
These are all the things, the things you make me do

[Chorus: Ashanti]
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
I'll wash your dishes, blowin' kisses in the bubbles, babe
I'll be your bad girl that loves to get in trouble, babe
I'll be your wife, I'll be the air you breathe
I'll be your drug, do anything to me
