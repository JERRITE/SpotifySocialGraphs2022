Bop to the Top Lyrics[Intro: Ryan & Sharpay]
Mucho gusto
¡Ay, qué fabulosa!
¡Rrrrr, ay, ay, ay!
¡Arriba!
¿Quieres bailar?
Mírame

[Verse 1: Sharpay, Ryan & Both]
I believe in dreamin', shootin' for the stars
Baby, to be number one, you've got to raise the bar
Kickin' and a-scratchin', grindin' out my best
Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success
Work our tails off every day
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away
[Interlude: Ryan & Sharpay]
¡Caliente!
¡Suave!

[Chorus: Sharpay, Ryan & Both]
Yeah, we're gonna
Bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop, hop 'til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop, pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove 'til the music stops
Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top

[Verse 2: Both, Sharpay & Ryan]
Gimme-gimme, shimmy-shimmy
Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle, do the hustle

[Chorus: Sharpay, Ryan & Both]
Yeah, we're gonna
Bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump, stump, stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff
Bop, bop, bop, straight to the top
Goin' for the glory
We'll keep steppin' up and we just won't stop (Stop)
'Til we reach the top
Bop to the topYou might also like4Embed
