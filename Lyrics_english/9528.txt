Between The Lines Lyrics[Bridge: Jase Harley]
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
When we get drunk and high
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
Where stuck between the lines
[Hook: Chris Lee]
And I'm just tryna read between the lines you know
I know that it's weighing on my mind I know
Gotta figure out my plans
You don't need to be with him
You don't need to be like them, nah

[Verse 1: Jase Harley]
You double tap everything that I post up
You fly like a girl I should see in a poster
Got niggas looking at me like a vulture
He be around, you texting me notes
Lying to me like he left you alone
Ain't turn the sound to your messages off
He went through your cell as I'm hitting your phone
We played it off like some friend that you know
I'm breaking y'all up like this stress is a joke
I get you high, cause he get's you low
With no Lexapro you so eager to go
He makes you mad and you say vamanos (vamanos)
Then show up at my door like dominos (door like dominos)
Delete them pictures so nobody knows (can't let nobody know)
You are too good for him you gotta know (gotta know)

[Bridge: Jase Harley]
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
When we get drunk and high
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
Where stuck between the lines

Between the lines
I'm just tryna read between the lines you know
I know that it's weighing on my mind I know
Gotta figure out my plans
You don't need to be with him
You don't need to be like them, nah

[Verse 2: Jase Harley]
Girl Scout cookies with vino
You know my green it be loud as pachino
OZ looking like Oscar the grouch
We get fucked up and you crash on the couch
But you never committed you runnin'
Cook up some food put it right in the oven
Netflix and chill we get high and we fuckin'
After that you leave the crib like it's nothing
Ain't no love letter don't sing me a song
We been going back and forth for too long
You coming over whenever I call
You ran through the door left the keys in the car
We fuckin' round he gone go catch a charge
You playing with fire, get out of Dodge
I know it's my fault for getting involved
But it's up to you if you string me along
I'm catching feelings like a common cold (common cold)
Been friends for years I know you not a hoe (you not a hoe)
Erase them pictures so nobody know (can't let nobody know)
You are too good for him you gotta know (gotta know)
[Bridge: Jase Harley]
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
When we get drunk and high
He don't do what I do
He don't know how to vibe
I'm just so into you
We're stuck between the lines
You say I make you happy
Y'all only fuss and fight
I'm just so into you
Where we get drunk and high

[Outro]
Drunk and High
What I do
How to vibe
I'm into you
Make you happy
I'm into you
I'm into you3Embed
