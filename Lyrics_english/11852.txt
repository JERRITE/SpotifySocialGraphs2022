Stop more lyrics ["Pégate more" letter]]

[Chorus]
Stop more
A little more
I want to tell you
I love you more
Stop more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
A little more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I want to tell you (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I love you more (OH-OH-OH-OH; more, more, more, more)
Slowly, do it slow
Make time stop
I go crazy to see your body
Along with your movements
[Post-car]
I love you, I know
You love me too
Let me see what you have for me-í-í
I love you, I know (eh-eh-eh)
You love me too (EH-EH-EH)
Let me see what you have for me-í-í

[Verse 1]
I tell him "Baby, ÉCHESE PA 'Here"
How good it looks with that body of gymnast
Tell me if you have an intact fantasy to please it
He doesn't care about anything, he leaves with me
How do you love to take it for a walk
And if they ask, I'm your friend
If the girl is cold, calm, that I will be her coat

[Pre-car]
Every time I find me
Arrived 'the next day
Every time I find me
They win 'are always turned on'

[Chorus]
Stop more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
A little more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I want to tell you (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I love you more (OH-OH-OH-OH; more, more, more, more)
Slowly, do it slow
Make time stop
I go crazy to see your body
Along with your movements

I love you, I know
You love me too
Let me see what you have for me-í-í

[Verse 2]
I know that people, in these times when they see us do not understand
And I don't deny it, it's my way of loving you
Impatient of your kisses
Of your hair, your body
Tell me where and I got

[Chorus]
Stop more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
A little more (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I want to tell you (OH-OH-OH-OH)
I love you more (OH-OH-OH-OH; more, more, more, more)
Slowly, do it slow
Make time stop
I go crazy to see your body
Along with your movements

[Post-car]
I love you, I know (eh-eh-eh)
You love me too (EH-EH-EH)
Let me see what you have for me-í-í
