[Intro]
Five 'E The morning, you call me' (Wuh!)
Just see who is in my bed (Nah!)
I don't have time for your 'drama'
I didn't call me 'to five' and the morning

Because surely rumba with my sister
You want to call me and only when you feel like it)
I want to dance tonight
I'm going to enjoy without reproaches
[Pre-stribe]
It makes you 'jealous if you see me' with another
I do what I want, I just enjoy it
Makes you 'jealous if you dance with another
I am not theirs, nor yours either

[Chorus]
I know that I tell me and I see you
And you look at me, I wiggle (ey)
Makes you 'jealous if you dance with another
I do what I want, I just enjoy it

You want Rom-Pom-Pom, Pom-Pom-Pom-Pom
I make Rom-Pom-Pom, Pom-Pom-Pom-Pom (I do it)
