He came to look for me and I knew it (uh)
I saw her attitude clear
He told me: "There are so many that I had" (UH)
But I'm missing you
I can't release you, don't be so cruel (hey)
From that blue night
My dad tells me that bad is him (uh)
What else can I do?

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
I am the tamer of all bad girls
Many hearts nailed to the sofa in my room
I still remember what I told him that morning
The first I want like Havana
Mommy What bowl?, Ooh-na-na
'Tá accompanied or you are alone, ooh-na-na (alone, alone)
But how easy me uncontrolled, ooh-na-na
You burn me, come back and roll me up, I roll me (ah, ah)
'Pal' Mambo arrives, seize the drum
For you remember Havana and the countryside
The freedom that well knows you
When will it return? Only God knows
Mommy What bowl?, Ooh-na-na
'Tá accompanied or you are alone, ooh-na-na (alone, alone)
But how easy me uncontrolled, ooh-na-na
You burn me, come back and ride me
Camila and Ramón Ayala of a bird are the two wings, oh-oh
