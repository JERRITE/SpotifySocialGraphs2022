When You’re Not Okay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me, did you walk into my life?
Just to leave it, just leave it?
Tell me, were you never satisfied?
Did you even? Tell me did you even
Care to tell me why, baby just 'cause you're shy
Doesn't give you the right
To just leave me hanging dry
When you said you'd never leave my side
I believed it
[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's cold
I don't know where you went
But it's not here
I feel older than before
Before you went and disappeared

[Chorus]
And I know you’re fine but if you change your mind
I won't be a call away
So you can try but I won't change my mind
Don't call me when you're not okay

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when you looked into my eyes
Did you feel it, did you feel it?
Tell me, were you bored and killing time?
Now I’m cleaning, tell me why I'm cleaning up
The mess that you made, while you're staying out late
Not telling me where you lay, said you'd be home around 8
Now I’m thinking it was all a lie
And I believed it

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it’s cold
I don't know
Where you went
But it’s not here
I feel older than before
Before you went and disappeared
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know you’re fine but if you change your mind
I won't be a call away
So you can try but I won't change my mind
Don't call me when you're not okay

[Outro]
Don't call me when you're not okay
Don't call me when you're not okay
Don't call me when you're not okay
Don't call me when you're not okayEmbed
