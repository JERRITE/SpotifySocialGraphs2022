Russ Millions x Fumez The Engineer - Plugged In LyricsPull up in a party with my chargie
No paparazzi, I'm with my army
Like kamikaze I'm a yardie
Cah my hair's coolie she think I'm Mali
Upfront like Vardy, shoot out the crowd
Hide your barbie
Badman don't suck punani
Man suck them breasts and mek her horny
Needs to hit that one more time
Old ting but the pum pum's mine
I'm with Wayne now she thinks I'm nine
That's my killy, bro, my slime
Spin the block, yo take that right
Stretch my arm and let one fly
Back my ting, rudeboi don't hide
Copper lеad get filled with bine
Killy with a milliе get busy
She wan' get friggy 'pon willy get giddy
Real badman, can't tek me for billie
Ya see mе, kilikilikilikeh habibti
For the culture likе Trick and Lippy
Do my dance like Shiggy
Show my gun lean now she wan' get friggy
Shorty said "Russ you're way too litty"
And let me keep it real, tell me who else went plat' off drill
Love a browning like Zeze Millz
Takin' my shot, go straight for the kill
Unless it make sense can't sign no deal
Don't get your head back peeled
Operate the ting with skill
Pull up on me and you might get drilled
But I never worked in retail
Got like a hundred bookings in my email
Amiri stitch, yeah she love the detail
Run them down and I love them females
Gas, gassed up like petrol
Real bad man from the ghetto
Hear the sound of that echo
Bullet blow out your marrow
R-U-Double S
North gyal's pum pum's the best
Ten ten ask xln
Yeng yeng, man creep and kweng
Make your car dash like shan
War ready like Taliban
In the field like Afghanistan
808 kick like Jackie Chan
