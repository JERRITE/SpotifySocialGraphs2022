The force of destiny Lyrics [letter of "the force of destiny"]

[Verse 1]
We saw each other three or four times
In all the city
One night at the Gold Bar
I decided to attack

You told me nineteen
I didn't want to distrust
But it is that neither little nor little
I didn't see where to grab
And we got into the car
My friend, your friend, you and me
I told you about giving me a kiss
You answered no

[Chorus]
We started bad and I thought
That this was a good plan

[Verse 2]
That night was a disaster
I didn't ate a hill
These are just a couple of narrow
We went to sleep

But the force of destiny
It made us repeat
Two cinemas and a couple of concerts
We started out

I don't know if that rare face
An eye here and a tooth there
Or the gypsy body
Half -end

[Chorus]
Your heart was what I
He finished falling in love
You Might Also Like [verse 3]
And we got into the car
My friend, your friend, you and me
I told you about giving me a kiss
You answered no

[Chorus]
We started bad and I thought
That this was a good plan

[Verse 4]
And since then until now
THE GAME OF LOVE
He had three years playing
Then he separated us

But the force of destiny
It made us repeat
What if winter is cold
I want to be with you

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I want to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I want to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I want to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I want to be with you5embed
