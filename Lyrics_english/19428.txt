Light Up The Sky Lyrics[Refrain: Dani Ummel]
I've been to Mars, I've been to Venus, I've been to Pluto about two times
You say you're a star, I've already seen this
The truth is I don't really care how you shine
Cause I light up the sky, cause I light up the sky
Cause I light up the sky, cause I light up the sky
Cause I light up the sky

[Verse 1: Sonny Shotz]
'Scuse me for the arrogance, I ain't down with the boos in comparison
So, how you say fuck you in French again
Never mind, je n'aime sais de laissez bien
Ah oui oui mofos, that's the lingo
Sonny so high, he don't pass the indo
My girl so fly she'll pass your window
You're sittin' on the plane like, damn
Maybe I'm trippin' or did we just land
I don't understand why the nights so long
It feels so good, but this life so wrong
Turn the lights off just to turn her on
Red-eye flight, exactly what it look like
Chiddy yelling "Live" I told him I'm digging the swelly life
X saying shit, we just might be on the verge
Of the double-XL, which is less than we deserve
[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Sonny Shotz]
In the game like points always coming up
Never miss a shot, tell the D they should double up
007 couldn't shoot us down
Never been Jay-Z, but I run this town
Now it's over cause we the next them
The first us and best freshmen
In the space shuttle with a crew-neck on
In a couple of dreams if you blink we gone
Super-fast, I need super-cash
A chick so bad with a (stupid-ass)
That's so generic, but so is this verse
The better you get, cause the shit gets worse
Well fuck it then, I done seen it all anyway
I could kill a beat with no mic, just energy
Never die poor: die rich, die young
And put a middle finger up for all the shit you've done
