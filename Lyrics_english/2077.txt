TranslationsEspa√±olBlame Myself Lyrics[Verse 1]
What did I say? What do you want?
I swear I'll make it up
Oh my gosh, what have I done?
Mm, pain in my chest, can't get to sleep
In these cold and empty sheets
Where did you go? Why did you leave?

[Chorus]
Lie to me, it would help
Just lie to me, say you found someone else
Lie to me, it would help
Just lie to me, say you found someone else
So I don't blame myself
[Pre-Drop]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So I don't blame myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So I don't blame myself

[Drop]
So I don't blame myself
So I don't blame myself

[Verse 2]
Movin' too fast, callin' it love
Was I just not enough?
Nothin' makes sense, it don't add up (Oh woah)
Slammin' the door, not sayin' a word
It just keeps gettin' worse
I'm not okay, honest, it hurts

[Chorus]
Lie to me, it would help
Just lie to me, say you found someone else
Lie to me, it would help
Just lie to me, say you found someone else
So I don't blame myself

[Build]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
So I don't blame myself (Hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
So I don't blame myself
(Oh, oh woah, oh)
So I don't blame myself

(Oh, oh woah, oh)
So I don't blame myself
(Oh, oh woah, woah)
So I don't blame myselfEmbed
