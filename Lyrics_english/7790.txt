Love You Lately Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sleep it off and sweat it out
I hope that you feel better now that my heart’s aching
And my mind’s racing

I’ve been up thinking all night wondering what you’re keeping inside
I reach for your hand but you pull away
And it might not be the right time
You need to know what’s on my mind
I don’t understand why you pull away
[Chorus]
I can feel you watch me in the morning
I don’t need to give you any warning
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Always let the distance come between us
Never on your side without a reason
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess i just don’t love you lately

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to bring it up?
I’ve been aiming steady for a better love
Till you changed my mind with your vacant eyes

I fought for such a long time, you never seem to be on my side
I reach for your hand, you push me away
It’s not just me and my pride, I’m never the one who’s looking for a fight
I don’t understand why you push away

[Chorus]
I can feel you watch me in the morning
I don’t need to give you any warning
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Always let the distance come between us
Never on your side without a reason
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess I just don’t love you lately
You might also like[Bridge]
I guess I don’t love you lately
I guess I don’t, I guess I don’t
I guess I don’t love you lately, I guess I don't
(Don’t have a reason to stay, I guess I don’t)
Guess I don’t, I guess I don’t
I never know what to say
I never know, I never know
(Don’t know what you want from me, I never know)
I never know what to say, I never know

[Chorus]
Cause I can feel you watch me in the morning
I don’t need to give you any warning
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Always let the distance come between us
Never on your side without a reason
Guess I just don’t love you lately
Guess I just don’t love you lately5Embed
