Something Beautiful Lyrics[Intro]
In Your ocean I'm ankle deep
I feel the waves crashing on my feet
It's like I know where I need to be
But I can't figure out, yeah, I can't figure out
Just how much air I will need to breathe
When Your tide rushes over me
There's only one way to figure out
But will You let me drown?
Yeah, will You let me drown?
[Chorus]
And hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for something beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, something beautiful

[Verse 2]
And the water is rising quick
And for years I was scared of it
We can't be sure when it will subside
So I won't leave Your side
No, I can't leave Your side

[Chorus]
Hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for something beautiful
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, something beautiful
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, something beautiful

[Bridge]
In a day dream, I couldn't live like this
I wouldn't stop until I found, something beautiful
When I wake up, and all I want I have
You know it's still not what I need, something beautiful

[Chorus]
Hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees
And waiting for something beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, something beautiful
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, something beautiful3Embed
