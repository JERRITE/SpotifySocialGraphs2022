Anything But Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're gonna say that I'm on a high horse
I think that my horse is regular-sized
Did you ever think, maybe, you're on a pony
Going in circles on a carousel ride?
You're gonna say I asked for the moon
I think that it's you with your head in the sky
All that I wanted was somebody honest
Living for more than their next good time

[Chorus]
You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When еverything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no rеgrets, you can call me if
There's anything you need
Anything, anything but
[Post-Chorus]
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and hate me as long as you need to
Go ahead and break me a piece of your mind
Say I always had one foot out
Well, baby, I got two now
Good thing I've never been afraid of goodbye

[Chorus]
You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets, you can call me if
There's anything you need
Anything, anything but
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Me, me, yeah-yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

[Bridge]
And sure, it's not all so black and white
Sure, I'm gonna cry
For the love we couldn't keep
But I would rather lose you
Than who I'm meant to be
So you can have anything but

[Outro]
Me, yeah (Me)
You can have anything but (Me)
Me, yeah (Anything)
You can have anything but (Anything)
Me, yeah (Me)
You can have anything but (Me)
Me, yeahEmbed
