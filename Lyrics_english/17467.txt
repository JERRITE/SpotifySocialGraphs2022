All They Wanna Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
Neon bar, crowded room
Still everyone's too lame to make a move (Make a move, make a move)
But we are wicked fools
And loose it on the floor just me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell us to stop, na na-na na-na
We're switchin' it up, na na-na na-na
And go till the drop
Don't tell us to stop, na na-na na-na
[Chorus]
We're gon' dance like we're out of regrets
'Cause we love how the sound's going straight to our heads
Too loud
Guess we're as good as it gets
'Cause they look at us
We are all they wanna be when we are dancing
We are all they wanna be, be, be

[Drop]
We are all they wanna be

We are all they wanna be
(Wanna be)
(Wanna, wanna be)
(Wanna be)
(Wanna wanna be)
(Wanna be)
(Wanna be)
(Wanna wanna be)
(Wanna be)
(Wanna wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Cloud of smoke, hard to breathe
Ain't stopping us from moving to the beat (To the beat, to the beat)
Bodies close, raisin' heat
Like we could go forever on repeat (On repeat)

Don't tell us to stop, na na-na na na
We're switchin' it up, na na-na na na
And go till the drop
Don't tell us to stop, na na-na na na

[Chorus]
We're gon' dance like
We're out of regrets
'Cause we love how the sound's going straight to our heads
Too loud
Guess we're as good as it gets
'Cause they look at us
We are all they wanna be when we are dancing
We are all they wanna be, be, be

[Drop]
We are all they wanna be

We're gon' dance like we're out of regrets
'Cause we love how the sound's going straight to our heads
Too loud
Guess we're as good as it gets
'Cause they look at us
We are all they wanna be when we are dancing
We are all they wanna beEmbed
