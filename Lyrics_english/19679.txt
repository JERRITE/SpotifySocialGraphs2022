Out Da Hood Lyrics[Intro: JL]
(Disko Boogie on the beat)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up

[Verse 1: JL]
Came with the game, got 'em all starstruckin' (ay)
Stuck on my chain, got that thing sparklin' (whoa)
Not the same, can't complain ‘bout the car shufflin’
Smoke good, grass on me like I'm yard cuttin' (ay)
Double L or Nuthin' never laid a seed in a dirty ho like gardening (whoa)
Fuck a lame, that guitar chugging
Hold the title like a glove compartment, they target 'em
I'ma take you back to the part with no hard duckin'
Had me charged
I was finna starve in the dark hun (grr)
Fast forward to the car with the start button
On the yard fuckin' on the floor 'cause new carpet in (whoa)
Got the whole hood goin' hammy
Frozen TV dinners to dining at Gordon Ramsay (ay)
Calamari with all the garnishment now I'm fancy (woo)
Niggas never thought I have all these diamonds on me dancing
[Pre-Hook: JL & (Nef The Pharaoh)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas ain't believe me
Now they say the same thing when they see me
Whoa
You doin' pretty damn good
I thought you'd never make it out the hood

[Hook: JL and Nef the Pharoah]
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Nigga's doin' pretty damn good

[Verse 2: JL]
Tell me I'm the one
I'm tryna do it twice
Everybody got advice
Devil come in disguise
Level come with a price
Everyone got a vice
On the run with my guys
Niggas all throwin' signs
Zigzag for the lime green
Polo for the high jean
Low key with the high beam
Do you run for the right thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Jet Li with the fight scene
Ink all on my light skin
In Dubai just sightseeing
Whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas ain't believe me
Now they say the same thing when they see me
Whoa
You doin' pretty damn good
I thought you'd never make it out the hood

[Hook: JL and Nef the Pharoah]
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Nigga's doin' pretty damn good

[Post-Hook: JL]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up

[Verse 3: Nef The Pharaoh]
Bling blaow, woo, look at my necklace
The Tesla drives itself, I'm not wreckin'
They thought I wouldn't make it out my section
It put a smile on my face when the checks in
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm doin' good
Chang the worldwide nigga that's still hood
Dem bitches should've believed me when I said believe me
Now I'm throwing money in the air like I'm bulimic
She wanna give me head, I tell that bitch I don't need it though
Dancin' in that pussy, I'ma get it when I see it
I spend thirty on the ice, but a nigga is anemic
And I always pack a heater, situations get heated
Mad that I came up
Let a nigga touch me and that's gonna be his last touch
Blow Draymond Green but I'm playing for the Bucks
The score ain't even, Condiments, ketchup
It's the Chang, nigga
[Hook: J.L. of B. Hood and Nef The Pharaoh]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas ain't believe me
Now they say the same thing when they see me
Whoa
You doin' pretty damn good
I thought you'd never make it out the hood

[Hook: JL and Nef the Pharoah]
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Thought we wouldn't make it out the hood
(Made it out the hood though)
Nigga's doin' pretty damn good

[Post-Hook: JL]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Niggas done came up1Embed
