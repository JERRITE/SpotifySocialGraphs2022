[Saying: Myke Towers & Blessd]
What else, baby? I went to greet
Since I haven't seen her again, I gave her place
A VECE 'I want to come back, don't go to doubt
You 'e' who has the power, tell me where you are, ey
What else, baby? I went to greet
Since I haven't seen her again, I gave her place
Sometimes I want to come back, don't go to doubt
You 'is the one who has the power, tell me where you are going'
[Chorus: Myke Towers]
I'm going to get to you and I'm going to steal you
If I sing 'Outs' global trend
Even 'Women' want to try you
Private travel like Pablo Escobar
I'm going to get to you and I'm going to steal you
If I sing 'Outs' global trend
Even 'Women' want to try you
Private travel like Pablo Escobar, ey

[Verse 1: Blessd & Myke Towers]
His eyes radiate sensuality (wuh)
His mouth tells me that he wants to kiss me (haha)
His gaze tempts me to touch her again
His 'hand' read me, I can't endure (ah, ah, ah)
Pa 'your sex I'm ready, the others seen
If I lose it, I can't leave it (huh)
The only one that could get me out of the street
With his 'good' kiss 'erased to' that evil
And I am a fan of that ass, this is a global trend
As Myke would say, you ere 'a goddess more'
Because of the way I look at me 'I am going to stay
Oh, my parcerita, I don't void to fail (no)
You are something else, somo 'soul' twins
You are my baby and pa 'you vo'a be (made in Medellín)
You know that with me it is a global trend
Like Paul to Virginia you will make you fall in love (Myke Towers, Baby)

[Verse 2: Myke Towers]
Ours e 'Flow Pablo and Virginia
Prepare the 'suitcase', forget about the airline
He likes to bath 'relaxing' in warm water
He is sending me sunflower ', Rosa' and Orquídea '
I know that I am annoying that I live in a trivia
I made him forget the 'old' relative
With brandy the suffering cushions it
I don't know why e 'that if they always deprive her (ah)
On the night 'of Lady' I am his gentleman
He wants an AP in Diamond ', I already indicated to the jeweler
In the apartment I 'neighbor' did not hear
One after another, she doesn't stop when she filled her
I left my smell on his sheet '
I have it imagining what will be
She and like the muse, arrives and does not go
He always likes to do it seeing the city '

[Chorus: Blessd]
I'm going to get you and I'm going to steal you (OH-OH)
If I sing, it is a global trend
Even 'Woman' want to try her (OH-OH)
I travel in private, I don't care about the place
I'm going to get you and I'm going to steal you
If I sing, it is a global trend
Until the same 'woman' want to try her
I travel in private, I don't care about the place
[Outro: blessd]
(Made in Medellín)
Junte pa 'history, PR and Colombia, he will go worldwide (hehe)
Ovy on the Drums, the blessed and Myke Towers, global trend
What else, baby?
I have not seen her again
O-O-Ovy on The Drumsembed
