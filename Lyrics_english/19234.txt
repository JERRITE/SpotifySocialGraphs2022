Slurp it (Mhm, ah), make it sloppy (Okay, okay, okay, okay)
Look at how I top shit, bitch
I just put like three up in the top ten
Now I don't need nobody, I just need these CCs on my body
Everything I do, bitch, right or wrong, gon' make a profit
Read about it, I don't even gotta sing about it

Hundreds (Grr) inside this bitch, a hundred sticks
A hundred bitches with a hundred thousand on my wrist, yeah
Baddie in my bed and she plan on drivin' me (What?)
Demons in my head, I can't stop 'em all from rottin' me
She want me to buy her some CCs
She wanna eat and I hope that she don't bite now
She on her knees, and she's worshipin' right now
With her friend I'm flirtin', now she wan' fight now
These people they know not to try me
I get in that mode and collect me a body
I'm up in New York like I'm Gotti
I'm ridin' lil' shorty like new Kawasakis

He want X', I'm likin' his sister
Want her to perform, so I gotta book her (Let's go, let's go)
She say, "Chanel bag," plus, I'm gon' flood her ears with boogers
They know not to try me, they know for a fact that I got it
On my hip and blue hundreds inside of my pocket
Mercedes-Benz with the Brabus kit body
I shipped it, I hit it, take off like a rocket (Vroom)
Long as she don't tell nobody, I'm gon' caress her whole body, uh
Know I'm ready as soon as she cum, uh
I lick it as soon as I'm done (Yeah, uh)
