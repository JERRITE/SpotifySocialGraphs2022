TranslationSengileshbruja Lyrics ["Witch" letter]]

[Intro]
Oh shit
Ark, ay
What was it? What was it? What was it? What was it? What was it? What was it?
La Do√±a, the Patroness, in this shit

[Verse 1]
Look, look that the little girl is crazy
My daughter, cream -colored skirt
Black heels, beige skirt
Beige heels, beige coat, red lips
Beige and black, beige and black
Go metal doll, goes metal doll
Give doll
[Verse 2]
Hissy Fit
Throw it up, Bitch
BOUNCE BACK, GET IT WET
Hit it, rip it, Stroke
Tranny Coming Hard
Till my chochi pulses raw
Oh my God
What a bizarre, House Disco, Baby
Hush it While I Lick My Bloody Claws, GRRR
Cuddly Fur, Sharpened Paws
Did i Stutter? Hear crushed me
While i'm shitting on the pavement
Wow, how? Throw The Towel
Oh, how bizarre, Ja, Boba
And what do you look ', Hah?
To'as these whores are my daughters
I eat them as sweets
Oh, how grim
Be so-so envious
Will be
It will be that they have no other
Yo Avasallo, neither scratch me, nor Rayo
No agenda, without trial, without failure

[Verse 3]
Little by little, I rise on top
Adrenaline Chute, Loca, Acesine
To'as look at me
On the street ', and I challenge you
Better, and with respect
There is respect, that if not A-A-AU
Squeeze, grrr
To the sound of the drums
They are Boquifloja '
Hah, this is silly
The fury that I summon
I get in my note
And all the dolls on the disc
Brinco and in a puddle and spleng
To'as my dolls are rich
Give him with confidence, girl, hihihi
Brujita de las good, hey
And without grief, without condemnation
I put it on you, I'm your dinner (dinner, dinner)
