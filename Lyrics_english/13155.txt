Suffocation Lyrics[Intro]
Rhinestone on my Ralph Lauren
Ten pills, now I'm stillborn
And I'm drinking Napalm
Acid burn my face off
I live in your blind spot
Drain Gang King, the night spawn
No one, that's the right one
I black out, my brain's gone

[Verse]
Had a bad dream then I woke up in Hell (In Hell)
At the hotel rollin' like a windmill (Rollin')
In a Range Rove', can't see through the windshield
This bitch head's fucked up, she need a Advil
My whole team fucked up and we got no chill (No chill)
Cut you off so quick, we told him hold still (Told him hold still)
Since we fell out, heard it's going downhill
Drain Gang CEO, this shit is unreal (Shit is unreal)
You shouldn't talk to me, baby, 'cause I'm two-faced ('Cause I'm two-faced)
I roll up ten grams then I get some toothpaste
Left some demons here, I need a new place
I fuck a check up, get it back in two days
Fuck a check up, get it back in two days
I can't get set up 'cause I'm in the blue rain
I can't get set up 'cause I'm in the blue rain
Trash Star King, falling 'cause I'm too vain
[Chorus]
Suffocation, plastic bag over my head
New destination, I'll be a dream, I'll be your dream
Punch your face in, make your face pretty again
Why are you waiting? In your dream, I'm in your dreams
Suffocation, plastic bag over my head
New destination, I'll be a dream, I'll be your dream
Punch your face in, make your face pretty again
Why are you waiting? In your dream, I'm in your dreamsYou might also like11Embed
