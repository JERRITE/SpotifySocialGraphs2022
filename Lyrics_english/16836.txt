â€‹all in my mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and you
All the things I'm doing to myself
Digging holes in my brain, trying to hide away
You know when it gets bad for your health
Things have gotta change 'cause they're not the same

[Chorus]
But it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
Now I don't even get to be alone
[Verse 2]
Talking ain't as easy when you're down
I know you know I'm tryna find the words to say
You told me you would always be around
But now you're gone I know that we were not okay
I'm so afraid of going home
So don't you go leave me on my own
Baby, why the hell you acting so cold?
I guess I'll never know, guess I'll never know

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
Now I don't even get to be alone

[Bridge]
Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and for you

[Outro]
Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and for you2Embed
