Grim Mary Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel like going anywhere tonight
Keep my shoes untied, you know where to find me
"If you can't be clever, then you must be kind"
Just another line that I read on a marquee

[Refrain]
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh
Oooh ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't feel like leaving my garage today
An acquired taste, the asbestos is lovely
Got a broken heater and a microwave
And Hot Pockets stains on the ceiling above me
[Chorus 1]
I'm so congested, festive all of the time
Another backseat driver, toeing the line
Ma-ma-ma Mary messaged me and said that my hair looks nice
But Mary doesn't know that I might wanna die

[Refrain]
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh (die)
Oooh ooh, ooh

Oooh ooh, ooh ooh (die)
Oooh ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
The pressure to smile is wearing me thin
And the high that I'm chasing is making me winded (Ah, ah, ah)
The lows that I feel leave me in my homestead (Ah, ah, ah)
Depression is a demon, my best friend on my death bed

[Chorus 2]
Robby told me that I'd never be comfy
There's a chip on my shoulder, on my back there's a monkey
Up against the wall, punching life in the chin
I was born to lose, but when I die I'll win (I guess)

[Refrain]
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh (die)
Oooh ooh, ooh

Dear Grim Reaper (Bless me with one million)
Take me under (Reasons not to live again)
To the ether (Reaper come and rescue me)
Too my slumber (I want to be happy)

Dear Miss Mary (Bless me with one million)
I'm so sorry (Reasons not to live again)
You are too good (Reaper come and rescue me)
Too good to me (I know you'll be out there)
I want to be happy

[Refrain]
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh
Oooh ooh, oohEmbed
