Full moon lyrics [full moon letter "]

[Pre-stribe]
If you want to stop what I am going to do now (what?)
Give the pause and stop fucking
I later ', Black, do not tell me' that I did not warn Nadita (na ')
Because yes I told you that this is TNT (Prr!)

[Chorus]
I'm not lobizon but I go on the full moon (Wuh!)
I have to 'in the club saying that I bring the cream (Wuh!)
Gordito Blanco eating the whole scene (Wuh!)
NENA, NENA, NENA (What?)
I am not lobizon but I go out on the full moon (crr!)
I have to 'in the club saying that I bring the cream (crr!)
White Gordito eating the entire scene (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (wuh!), Hey
[Verse 1]
They are wondering how to do it (ah)
I have no idea how I get (Yeah)
All 'the' eme 'that now I have (ah)
They ask me for a recipe and I do not understand (ha!)
I convert the place in a concert
And so I stay until I am dead
I'm not a selling but something I sell
Yes, I'm fun, but this is serious
I live laughing but that doesn't mean that nothing matters to me
I already spent the bad ones, I have the good ones, that's why I started enjoying
And what is going, is not a prosecutor, do not ask me na 'more'
Just because I have a couple of followers should not know all my life

[Bridge]
PA-SA, that if they see me in the Ace-Ra (what?)
They know that I left Pla-Z (Yeh-eh)
And now the target does notice-pe-pega
What, what, me '

[Chorus]
I am not lobizon but I go out on the full moon (crr!)
I have to 'in the club saying that I bring the cream (crr)
White chubby eating the whole scene
Nena, baby, baby
I am not lobizon but I go out on the full moon (what?)
I have to 'in the club saying that I bring the cream (ha!)
White Gordito eating the whole scene (what?)
Nena, Nena, Nena, Nena (Wuh!)

Because I know very well that I will not stop
I have my mistakes but you too
Stop fucking, now I'm going Flex (what?; What?)
I know, I know (Yeh-Yeh, Yeh-Yeh, Yeh-Yeh, Yeh-Yeh)
Now I'm going well, now I'm going well
I have jaguare 'that are eating your avoidance of one hundred
Now I'm going well, now I'm going well
I have jaguars who are eating your avoidance of one hundred
I have a expensive style, expensive
I already know, my black
And I don't compare myself, but I'm glad
That these turnips that are telling me
That nothing is worth, while I go up zero
Now I earned my clothes, I earned my money
I earned my girl, I explodes to 'the whatsapp
They ask me for more issues, I'm at home
Paste 'on the scene, spotted with fat
I don't know what happens to them, he
I don't know what happens to them, he
I don't know what happens to them, he
I don't know what happens to them, he

I later ', Black, don't tell me' I didn't let Nadita
Because yes I told you that this is TNT (Prr!)

I am not lobizon but I go out on the full moon (what?)

I have to 'in the club saying that I bring the cream (prr)
White chubby eating the whole scene
