TranslationsEspañolTroubled Paradise Lyrics[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were my remedy
Love like a fever dream, yeah
Now we are enemies
I still got the memories
I look up and see your face
A feeling I can't erase
Let it all go to waste
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Reminisce of the days when you were mine
You and me in the rain watching lightning strike
And I still don't wanna let you go, oh
You left me here and I'm all alone, oh
Found heaven in your eyes
Blue-green just like the skies
Your love was my demise
Troubled paradise

[Verse 2]
We locked eyes when I saw you for the first time
Oh my, baby, it was love at first sight
Oh why, why'd you have to let the love die?
I won't cry, but I'll love you 'till the end of time
Ah, then you threw it all in my face
Showed me that you’ve had me replaced
Don't you know you made a mistake, now?
Oh, wow, why'd you have to lead me on?
Oh, wow

[Bridge]
It's a joke to you, I got feelings too
Oh, what will you do when no one loves you?
Took me, used me up, was I sweet enough?
Please tell me the truth, did you love me too?
Sat there in the rain, smiled through the pain
Made your problems mine, forgave every lie
Watched you holding her, it's what I deserve
She told me to go, now I'm all alone
It's a joke to you, I got feelings too
Oh, what will you do, when no one loves you?
Took me, used me up, was I sweet enough?
Please tell me the truth, did you love me too?
Sat there in the rain, smiled through the pain
Made your problems mine, forgave every lie
Watched you holding her, it's what I deserve
She told me to go, now I'm all alone

Reminisce of the days when you were mine
(Reminisce, reminisce of when you were mine)
You and me in the rain watching lightning strike
(Watching lightning strike)
And I still don't wanna let you go, oh
You left me here and I'm all alone, oh (Now I'm all alone)
Found heaven in your eyes (In your eyes)
Blue-green just like the sky (Oh, just like the sky)
Your love was my demise
