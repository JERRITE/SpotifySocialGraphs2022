TranslationsРусскийI Like (the idea of) You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a radar for trouble and you're a renegade
I take a leap, and I stumble while you are unafraid
I keep repeating, repeating the way you say my name
Oh, oh (Mmm)
I try convincing my friends that you're not right for me
We just don't make any sense, but still, you fight for me
I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
But I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you, ooh
[Verse 2]
I know I shouldn't be guessing, but you're impressing me
And I can't help reading into what you've been texting me
I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh (Ooh)
And yeah, I know I don't need it, but wouldn't it be neat?
We fall in love with a feeling, just feeling you and me
I keep repeating, repeating the way we shouldn't be
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
But I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you, ooh

[Bridge]
Get everything that you want, my love, my time, my money
You think I'd learn, but I love your touch is sweet like honey
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear you call me funny
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
I like the idea-dea of you
Wonder how it'd be, be to love you
I like the idea-dea of you, ooh8Embed
