The mouth Lyrics [lyrics by "La Boca" ft. Camilo]

[Enter: Mau and Ricky]
King Mau and Ricky
Yes Yes

[Verse 1: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
Although I was looking
I keep keeping you the place
And no matter how much I try
I know that none will change you (mmh)
I hardly sleep
For walking looking at my cell phone
Just in case you forgot
You didn't want to call me
[Pre-Caro: Mau and Ricky]
My body needs you
My mouth needs you
Why don't you come right now?

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
I'm dying for kissing my mouth, mom
I have been dreaming about trying again
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea

[Verse 2: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
If I don't have you, I die (no, no)
You are not and the jealousy kills me
I leave the air if you leave (don't go)
Because life goes away
Baby, yes, I love you for me (for me, for me)
I don't want to share you (Oh No No No)
As ice in the desert (like ice in the desert)
I melt for you (pra!)
Because when you are far (when you are not)
I feel that I get old (ey)
I don't spend time

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
I'm dying for kissing my mouth, mom
I have been dreaming about trying again
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea (to the beach, mommy)

Na, Na, Na, Na, Eh
I want you with me
Na, Na, Na, Na, Eh
Please, I ask you
Na, Na, Na, Na, Eh
I want you with me
Na, Na, Na, Na, Eh
Please, I ask you

[Bridge: Mau and Ricky]
Although I was looking
I keep keeping you the place
And no matter how much I try
I know that none will change you

[Pre-car: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
My body needs you (it needs you)
My mouth needs you (he needs you)
Why don't you come right now?

[Chorus: Camilo & Mau and Ricky]
I'm dying for kissing my mouth, mom
I have been dreaming about trying again
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance (Yeah)
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea (from the sea, the sea, the sea)
[Post-Coro: Mau and Ricky]
Na, Na, Na, Na, Eh
I want you with me
Na, Na, Na, Na, EH-EH

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky & Camilo]
I'm dying for kissing my mouth, mom
I have been dreaming about trying again
Because you dance like nobody else knows how to dance
You look like the beach and the waves of the sea
