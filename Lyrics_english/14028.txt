Hiding tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tomorrow, I'll be quicker
I'll stare into the strobe light flicker and afloat, I'll stay
But I'm quite alright hiding today
Tomorrow, I'll be faster
I'll catch what I've been chasing after and have time to play
But I'm quite alright hiding today

[Chorus]
And I will play the coconut shy
And win a prize even if it's rigged, I won't know when to stop
And you can leave off my lid and I won't even lose my fizz
I'll be the polka dots type
I'll know the way back if you know the way
But if you are, I am quite alright hiding today
[Verse 2]
Tomorrow, I'll be stronger
Running colourful, no longer just in black and white
And I'm quite alright hiding tonight

[Chorus]
And I will have a game on the coconut shy
And win a prize even if it's rigged, I won't know when to stop
And you can leave off my lid and I won't even lose my fizz
I'll be the polka dots type

[Bridge]
I'll probably swim through a few lagoons
I'll have a spring in my step
And I'll get there soon
To sing you a happy tune
Tomorrow

[Outro]
And you better bring a change of clothes
So we can sail our laughing pianos
Along a beam of light
But I'm quite alright hiding tonightYou might also like8Embed
