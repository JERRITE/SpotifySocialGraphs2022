I want to know Lyrics ["I want to know" ft letter. Dillon Francis]

[English Translation]

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about you a couple of days
I have a couple of nights dreaming of you
Nothing feels like yesterday
Being far makes me doubt
I have been writing songs
I've been keeping my emotions
I stay home to avoid temptations
But he only thinks
[Chorus]
I want to know what you do now that I am absent
I want to know what would you do if you have me in front
I want to know if what you feel is so strong
How do you make me believe
I want to know, know

[Verse 2]
I want to know, what happens for your mind, when you look at me
I want to know, if you know how I feel, how do you give me
You should know, it is time that you accept, that it is only you
Baby is you
You and I

[Chorus]
I want to know what you do now that I am absent
I want to know what would you do if you have me in front
I want to know if what you feel is so strong
How do you make me believe
I want to know, know

[Modified Choir]
I want to know what you do now that I am absent
I want to know what would you do if you have me in front
I want to know if my love is enough
Help me to understand
I want to know, knowyou mihht Also like1embed
