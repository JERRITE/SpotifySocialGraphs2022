The Dying of the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
I keep on running but I can’t get to the mountain
Behind me lie the years that I've misspent
And I’ve been sinking like a flower in the fountain
When all the love I’m gonna need is heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Gonna try my best to get there
But I can’t afford the bus fare
And the storm that’s rolling over
Man, it makes me wanna cry
[Chorus 1]
And I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there’d be no time for getting old when we were young
It’s alright, if you dance with me tonight
We’ll fight the dying of the light and we’ll catch the sun

[Verse 2]
Woke up sleeping on a train that was bound from nowhere
Echoes that I could hear were all my own
The world had turned and I’d become a stranger
And I'm tired of watching all the flowers turn to stone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I tried my best to get there
But I can’t afford the bus fare
And the storm that’s rolling over
Man, it makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And the cold against my shoulder
When it comes on in the winter
And it seems to last forever
And it makes me wanna, it makes me wanna cry…

[Chorus 2]
I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there’d be no time for getting old when we were young
It’s alright, if you dance with me tonight
We’ll fight the dying of the light and we’ll catch the sun

Gonna try my best to get there
But I can’t afford the bus fare
And the storm that’s rolling over
Man, it makes me wanna cry

[Chorus 1]
And I was told
That the streets were paved with gold
And there’d be no time for getting old when we were young
It’s alright, if you dance with me tonight
We’ll fight the dying of the light and we’ll catch the sun

[Outro]
And the cold against my shoulder
When it comes on in the winter
Man, it makes me wanna cry
And the cold against my shoulder
And it seems to last forever
And it makes me wanna, it makes me wanna cry...12Embed
