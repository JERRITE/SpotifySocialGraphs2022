New Dark Ages Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now can you hear the call in our rambling little land?
Susurrations that can expand beyond all hope of light
And plunge us into unrelenting night
A pall on truth and reason
It feels like hunting season
So avoid those lines of sight and we'll set this right

[Chorus]
Welcome to the new dark ages
Yeah, I hope you're living right
These are the new dark ages
And the world might end tonight
[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now come ye children, one and all
Let's heed Ezekiel's call and bide until the word is good and right
Then get plucked clean out of sight
The world will be erased
Our kin will be immaculate ejaculate in space
Before the king of king's love, he'll snatch us from above
Brothers, help me sing it

[Chorus]
Welcome to the new dark ages
Yeah, I hope you're living right
These are the new dark ages
And the world might end tonight

[Bridge]
So how do you sleep?
There's nothing to keep, this is deep
Because we're animals with golden rules, who
Who can't be moved by rational views, yeah

[Chorus]
Welcome to the new dark ages
I hope you're living right
Welcome to the new dark ages
Say it again, yeah
You might also like[Outro]
These are the new dark ages
I hope you're living right
Welcome to the new dark ages
And the world might end tonightEmbed
