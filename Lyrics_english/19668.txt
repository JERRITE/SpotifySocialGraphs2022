Bass Lyrics[Verse 1: Merkules]
Made it out the hood, now these motherfuckers act like I didn't work for it (Hmm)
I've been doing good, you used to stab me in the back in the past like I never could first (Hmm)
Went from that beat-up Honda Civic to a tour bus, whole squad in it, it could only hold four of us
I've been countin' hundies in my undies, I need more bucks, hotel room full of smoke, keep the door shut (Woo)
Please do not get me confused, millions and millions of views (Yeah, yeah)
Just got a crib with a pool, but I still live in the booth (Yeah, yeah)
Gotta backpack full of ammo, hoodie matte-black and my pants all camo' (Woo)
I just took a shot of Jack Daniels, doing more numbers than the neighborhood trap phone (Woo)
Y'all could keep talking anonymous, honestly, I can see y'all want no part of this (No)
Doggie I put my whole heart in this, said he want smoke 'til I'm roaming like Spartacus
Ooh, I'm feeling like a million in cash, I'ma spend it right now and I'll still get it back (Ayy)
I just went and got a new whip that I'll probably never drive just to fill my garage
Cold steel with the bars, I can feel that they soft, come and deal with the boss (Damn)
You think you hot, but you're not, 'cause your shit's all ass like Nicki Minaj (Ouch!)
I don't mean to flex right now, but I know I'm at my all-time best right now (That's right)
Pumping on my chest right now, when your war get close, you the next one down
Let's go
[Chorus: Merkules]
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
How can a hater say I'm irrelevant?
Speakin' before you check it out is never intelligent
Like I'm dead and to Hell I went, but I'm flying over you like a pelican
Flies never get the swatting from elephants
Eloquent that's why this big amount of mail is spent
But the jealous sent all kinda embellishments
Try to yell against me and your fail is meant
Now your shell isn't not even an element (Cheah)
Tech in the mean zone, your team gone
Run away from a killer to somebody to lean on
I get the green holmes (Cheah), they wanna ring chrome
Everyone will bite the dust (Queen song) (Cheah)
Fuckin' Ding Dong, you a Hostess
I'm the owner that gonna just bring on dope shit (Cheah)
That make 'em cling on like a coke bitch
Fiends on the low get streamed on (Wit' a bro dick) (Cheah)
N9na, he never go lightly, got the shotta for true (Yeah, yeah)
She know my cheddar throw hyphy, lots ciabatta to spew (Yeah, yeah)
King of the letters, bro, I be hot, your squad is the loo (Yeah, yeah)
Niggas forever no like me, atsa matta for you *gunshot, gunshot*
Want it? Then you gotta be competitive
Don't be coming like you on a sedative
Give the people some better shit
Have some motherfuckin' rapper etiquette
If you goin', you go like you never did, be on top and ahead of it
After I leave, yes, I'm back on the road to stack up my G's
Tech and Merkules, the rappers y'all need to super-charge you with no battery Aziz (Bitch)
What?
You might also like[Chorus: Merkules]
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
I been lowkey for a minute, I think it's time I come out the Batcave
This ain't the time for you to man up and act brave, I'm outta my mind, but it's sustainable rap craze
I'm on the grind, you know the flow is divine, that's why I been on the rise like a volcano when ash sprays
These are your last days, I'm ripping your limbs like crab legs, they shouldn't have let me play in this rap race, I'm back, mane
Who said I'm fallin' off? In my celly, you gon' see a lot of broads
And you know that the pussy is fire, that's why they throw it at me like a Molotov (Woah)
Mo'fuckers finna get punished, you gon' see the whole damn rap game plummet (Yeah)
Yeah, this nigga Hop done-done it, you ain't even see my little black ass coming (No!)
Guys hold up, 'cause I am so nuts when I roll up, you might wanna keep the door locked
A high roller, I rhyme vulgar, 'cause I'm sorta a bi-polar beast that you're not (Yikes!)
Niggas see the things I do, they be like, "Hop, I wanna be like you" (Like you)
She said: "Yeah, I got a man, but for the 'Ill Mind', I would leave my boo"
You poor bastards bow down to your master, you're last to finish the race
Of course, that's the only outcome it could've been, 'cause I bust like a torn magnum
See, I summons the mic like it was Thor's hammer, body slammin' these beats 'til the floor shatters
And I keep rappers as a reward, their corpses are stiff on the floor, the sword jammed in
Let's go

[Chorus: Merkules]
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)
They throwing dirt on my name, I might just burst into flames (Burst into flames)
They tryna surf on my wave, I ain't gon' turn down the bass (Turn down the bass)6Embed
