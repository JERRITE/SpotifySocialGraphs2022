Something musical lyrics ["something musical" ft lyrics. Archangel]

[Choir: Ñejo, Archangel]
You have something nice in you, something very special
MMM, Mommy, what will be?
You have something sexy in you, something musical
And teach it

[Verse 1: ñejo]
This is music, that when you hear it
The first thing you think is to take a dust
And it's not that support you, tell drugs not
But if you plan to smoke something, dad, you keep me if you have plenty
FIVE AND FIFTEEN THE TIME
What you charge does not give you even to enlarge the soda, but that fucks
Give it, turn on the radi
The one who does not like music tell him that it is better to commit suicide
[Verse 2: Archangel]
Because this is to make him well
How it has to be
Get to the One, Two, Step
One, Two, Step, Ey
The baby arrived, take care that I don't stay '
And I have the music for you hesitate '
With whom jump mile '
With her, mommy, I've had Mile '
Thanks to her women persecute me

[Bridge 1: Dalmatian, Archangel]
Follow me mommy cool
With Vamono 'music on a trip
And teach it
Vamo 'to run off the track
Mommy cool, Vamono 'on a trip

[Verse 3: Dalmatian]
This is medicine for the horn
That active female adrenaline
The baby dances until when walking
Following the corner to corner movement
Live music with wild movement
Let the rhythm take you on a trip
Full of sweat in your suit
