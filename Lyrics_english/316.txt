Before I Die Lyrics[Intro]
Ohhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
Before I die I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully I don't leave you on your own
Hit you up with the bone bone bone
Not a thug but you still be my hoe
Need a hundred thousand girls at my door
Smoke my dope now we gotta get to go

Wet on wet, pipe in the ocean that's sex on sex
Sex on sex, I nut and then wassup, what's next
