Fuck Around and Find Out Lyrics[Intro]
(Huh, woah)
(Fuck what these niggas be talkin' 'bout)
(Fuck what these niggas be talkin' 'bout)
(We gon' spark it out) Ayy
Spark it out

[Chorus]
Fuck what these niggas be talkin' 'bout
We gon' spark it out, just take 'em out
Put 'em in a bag and shut they mouth (Shut up)
Police walk around, they won't hear a sound (Yuh)
I'm all by myself and I keep it a hundred
I keep a clip on me, if i see an opponent
Driving a foreign and they think that it's stolen
Pull up at the function they won't even notice (Uh-huh)
Fuck what these niggas be talking 'bout
We gon' spark it out, just take 'em out (Huh)
Put 'em in a bag and shut they mouth (Shut up)
Police walk around, they won't hear a sound (Huh)
I'm all by myself and I keep it a hundred
I keep a clip on me, if I see an opponent (Yeah)
Driving a foreign and they think that it's stolen
Pull up at the function they won't even notice

[Verse]
Been feelin' so sick inside
Can't really feel pain in mind (Huh)
These niggas they stealing my shine
And all of my friends turn to enemies
Can't be friends so they try to end me
And then they came with some of the envy
And chemically mixed with the jealousy
I don't think I don't want no friends
Lone star nigga, til' the end
I don't think I want a bitch
Matter of fact, I want me some
Type bitch to love me some
Type bitch to know I'm wrong
When she know I ain't feelin' right
Two cups Sprite mixed with ice
Beautiful when I think suicide
You might also like[Bridge]
Eyes closed when I'm in paradise
Blood streaks comin' out my eyes
You will feel the pain inside
Feel the stabs up in my back
Niggas plot behind my back
But won't talk with they chest
Won't rest until I'm blessed
Bullet hole down in your head

[Chorus]
Fuck what these niggas be talkin' 'bout
We gon' spark it out, just take 'em out (The fuck?)
Put 'em in a bag and shut they mouth (Shut up)
Police walk around, they won't hear a sound (Yuh)
I'm all by myself and I keep it a hundred
I keep a clip on me, if I see an opponent (Uh-huh)
Driving a foreign and they think that it's stolen
Pull up at the function they won't even notice (Uh-huh)

Fuck what these niggas be talkin' 'bout
We gon' spark it out, just take 'em out (Huh)
Put 'em in a bag and shut they mouth (Shut up)
Police walk around, they won't hear a sound (Huh)
I'm all by myself and I keep it a hundred
I keep a clip on me, if I see an opponent (Yeah)
Driving a foreign and they think that it's stolen
Pull up at the function they won't even noticeEmbed
