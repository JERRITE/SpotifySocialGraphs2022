Rooftop Lyrics[Intro]
I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel right

[Chorus]
I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel right
[Verse]
Shawty I would never believe
That you would ever leave me
Four years it's been me, you and us
I even went and bought your daddy a truck
(Girl you played me)
And now my boys tease me
'Cause you been ducking when you see me
A little apple juice with more henney
I'm 'bout to get higher then normally

420
How could you up and leave me
You made it look so easy
How you wake up like: enough is enough
Like transformers did to Shia LaBeouf

You got me in my feelings
Trapped only you can free me
Now you're stuck in my head every day
Na, na, na, na replay

[Pre-Chorus]
I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel right
You might also like[Chorus]
I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel right

I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel right

[Outro]
I am drunk of the rooftop
Baby
Touching stars in my mind
Spending life now without you
Baby
It somehow doesn't feel rightEmbed
