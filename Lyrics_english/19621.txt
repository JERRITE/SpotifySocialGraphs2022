DIRT ON MY NAME Lyrics[Intro]
Shout out Hit-Boy (Hit-Boy)

[Chorus]
Got a lot of dirt up on my name
I might've had a rap beef with the whole game
I'm spraying everything, I don't really need to aim
I really be in traffic, why I'm always switching lanes
I'm in a leather jacket, motorcycle with the flames
Niggas switched sides, man, I thought we was bros
I'm still outside on the 7 with the Moes
Slide out west with Armani and the Fo's
Soon as it land, he gon' fly the whole load
[Verse 1]
Shorty, where you been? I been stackin' on the low
Opps tryna send me to the end of the road
Nigga's from the Chi, so you know I can't go
I might have to smack a nigga on his own show
BET, clown with a freestyle
I'm a demon but thе devil's in the details
Free my nigga Jamеs in them chains
Gave him 15 for a leg shot, we need a retrial

[Interlude]
Then what the— what the fuck do we need a Vic Mensa?
I know this Vic Mensa thing just happened
Vic Mensa's fucked
Vic Mensa, what the fuck? (Vic Mensa)

[Chorus]
Got a lot of dirt up on my name
I might've had a rap beef with the whole game
I'm spraying everything, I don't really need to aim
I really be in traffic, why I'm always switching lanes
I'm in a leather jacket, motorcycle with the flames
Niggas switched sides, man, I thought we was bros
I'm still outside on the 7 with the Moes
Slide out west with Armani and the Fo's
Soon as it land, he gon' fly the whole load

Money on my head, I guess they ain't have enough
Niggas said it was a 50-pack, he should've doubled up
Almighty Black Stone, I ain't never gotta duck
Pull strings like a durag, niggas actin' tough
Wait, I got a bone to pick
When you speakin' on my name, watch your tone and shit
22 on me if he think he on some shit
I'll beat a nigga ass like he stole some shit
It's the re-up, we turn the heat up, la familia
I'm with the bleeders, East Side shit, bia, bia
I need a diva, dark-skinned, my Lupita
Two-seater, just me and my nina
I been booted up just to deal with the lows
Mental health problems, I think everybody knows
Niggas say, "Vic, how you deal with the hate and the fake?"
Let me set the record straight 'cause I

[Chorus]
Got a lot of dirt up on my name
I might've had a rap beef with the whole game
I'm spraying everything, I don't really need to aim
I really be in traffic, why I'm always switching lanes
I'm in a leather jacket, motorcycle with the flames
Niggas switched sides, man, I thought we was bros
I'm still outside on the 7 with the Moes
Slide out west with Armani and the Fo's
Soon as it land, he gon' fly the whole load
[Outro]
Yes sir, yes sir, that goes good, yeah, definitely, praise Allah
Praise Allah, it's all love, lil' bruh-bruh
It's all Stone love to the max, straight Stone love to the max
Marks get scared, marks get scared, brother

Every human being naturally wants to feel empowered
Because of how we desire so many opportunities
The main people that's respected in Chicago
Is the shooters and shit
Free the shooters
Free the shooters and give 'em somethin' better to shoot forEmbed
