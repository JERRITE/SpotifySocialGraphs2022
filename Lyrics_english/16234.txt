[JACKSON STUDENTS]
Move!
[CAMPBELL]
Homeroom class
I’m looking for someone to follow
So I know my way
But everyone's going their own way now
Can somebody, anyone show me around?

[JACKSON STUDENTS]
Don't follow me (Hey)
Why you on top of me? Leave me alone
Do your own thing (Oh)
Do your own thing (Hey)
Comin' through (Hey)
I ain't following you, do what you gotta do
Do your own thing (Oh)
Do your own thing (Hey)
Crap. It's. Time. For. Class

[TEACHER, spoken]
Class, please welcome a new transfer student from Truman High. Please give a warm Jackson welcome to—oh, what's your name? Campbell?

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Campbell!

[CAMERON, spoken]
Like the soup
[TWIG, spoken]
Looking hot, cream of mushroom
[BRIDGET, spoken]
Campbell?!

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Bridget! Thank god!

[BRIDGET, spoken]
Oh Em Goodness, you got redistricted too?

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Can you believe this?

[BRIDGET, spoken]
I'm in heaven! I bet I’ve got until lunch at least, before everyone sees I’m a spaz!

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
I wish Steven was here, I’m so not used to not fitting in

[BRIDGET, spoken]
Oh, I've got lots of experience with not fitting in! Do you need some pointers?

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
I guess

[BRIDGET, spoken]
Okay!

(sung)
Step one: To become invisible
Books up, de-accentuate the physical
Head down, use only your peripherals
Stick with me, we'll be indivisible

[CAMPBELL]
They've taken a hatchet and hacked my—

[JACKSON STUDENTS]
Move

[CAMPBELL]
Team apart
They've taken my high school career and—
Pressed restart
I’m looking for someone to follow, so I know my way

[BRIDGET]
But hey, we're finding our own way now
And isn't that what being young’s all about?
Check it out now[JACKSON STUDENTS]
Don't follow me

Why you on top of me?
Leave me alone
Do you own thing
Do your own thing 
[BRIDGET]
Don't follow
​anybody
Everyone here
​does their own thing
We'll do our own thing 
[BRIDGET]
Come on, let's go crunking in the parking lot

[CAMPBELL]
What?

[BRIDGET]
You know crunking crunking!

[TWIG, spoken]
You looking fine, baby

[BRIDGET, spoken]
Sorry what?

[TWIG, spoken]
I said you lookin' fine!

[BRIDGET, spoken]
Jinkies! No one has ever said that to me before! With the exception of a hobo once and my youth pastor

[RANDALL]
What's up man?

[CAMERON]
Yo, what it do kid? You got the stuff?

[RANDALL]
Chopped and screwed it

[CAMERON]
Damn, I can't wait to use it

[RANDALL]
I'm telling you it's crack, so don't lose it

[CAMERON]
Check it out, it's that cute Campbell Soup kid

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Campbell

[RANDALL]
I'm sorry, who's this?

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Are you guys selling crack?

[RANDALL]
Don't be stupid
Dude, it's a memory stick full of music!

[CAMPBELL]
I’m sorry, I'm such a doofus
I'm jumping to conclusions, I’m useless

[RANDALL]
Hey, it's cool, you're new, you'll get through this

[CAMPBELL & BRIDGET]
Right now, we stick out like two toothpicks

[CAMPBELL]
I’m so confused as to who's in whose clique
Where are the surfer dudes? Who are the cool kids?

[RANDALL]
We don't travel in groups but the truth is—

[RANDALL & TWIG]
We do have a dance crew and they're ruthless

[VOICE]
Nautica
La Cieniga

Let 'em through they can really move!

Excuse I’m trying
Somebody, anyone, show me arou—

[DANIELLE, spoken]
Yo, I said move

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Oh, sorry[JACKSON STUDENTS]

Coming through
I ain't following you
Do what you gotta do

Oh snap

Oh snap

Do your

​own thing

Do your
​own thing
Own thing, own thing
