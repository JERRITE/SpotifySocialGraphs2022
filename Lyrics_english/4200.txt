Translationshebrewengglishel Bathroom Lyrics [Lyrics for "The Bath" FT. Bad Bunny]

[Intro: Enrique Iglesias]
(One Love, One Love)
When I saw you
My heart stopped, stopped beating
I want us to be alone ', for you out of you
Disculp me, my love, for this invitation

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let's go for a bathroom, that nobody will see us
If you don't know me, we get to meet
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
Being one more day like that I can't stand it
Vámono 'to the Moon, Vamono' Pa'l Cinema
Vamo 'to give' a kiss that never ends
If you want 'something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'
[Bridge: Enrique Iglesias]
Oh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'
Quiet, you have to see tomorrow

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
If I see you again, it stops again
Breathing to see you dance
If you know you liked, why are you crazy?
When I look at you, you bite your mouth
I just want to see you dancing without clothes
In the same bed, in the same note

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let's go for a bathroom, that nobody will see us
If you don't know me, we get to meet
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
Being one more day like that I can't stand it
Vámono 'to the Moon, Vamono' Pa'l Cinema
Vamo 'to give' a kiss that never ends
If you want 'something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'

[Bridge: Enrique Iglesias]
Oh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'
Quiet, you have to see tomorrow
Oh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend 'or we are nothing
Quiet, you have to see tomorrow

(Yeh, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
Hesitate, that life is fast (wuh)
Like your ex that was half an early (UH)
With you always echo more than two (heh-heh)
You warm you 'alone, without breaking up, Yeh (Yeh)
Quiet, little by little he knows me '(Wuh)
For now I want to give you in to'as the pose '(Yeh)
If they leave me, I do it to you 'the closet
You are already hot and they are not twelve yet, Yeh (Wuh, Wuh)
Hesitate, that life is just one (one)
I get to my heart, you get a lagoon
Calls me after one (wuh)
Santa Dia, diabla when the moon falls, Yeh

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Let's go for a bathroom, that nobody will see us
If you don't know me, we get to meet
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
Being one more day like that I can't stand it
Vámono 'to the Moon, Vamono' Pa'l Cinema
Vamo 'to give' a kiss that never ends
If you want 'something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'

[Bridge: Enrique Iglesias]
Oh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend 'or we are corduroy'
Quiet, you have to see tomorrow
Oh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend 'or we are nothing
Quiet, you have to see tomorrow
