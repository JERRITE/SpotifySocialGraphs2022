Toe Tags & Broken Skulls Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, shoutout ZCR for the beat ([?], badda-bing, badda-boom, you make the moves, you just gotta flip)
(They'll never understand, man)
One take (You don't gotta worry about a fuckin' thing)
(I'm convinced they will never understand the genius that is Fukkit, man)
Yeah (It's beyond human comprehension)
Uh, yeah (Heh)
(You feel me? It's beyond⁠— It's beyond⁠ the primitive mindset, you feel me?)
Yeah (Badda-bing, badda-boom)
(Y’all gotta evolve to keep up with this one, uh-huh)
Uh, yeah
(Uh, nah, I'm playing, I'm a dumbass)
Uh, you could get touched, bitch
[Chorus]
You could get touched, bitch, we not playing tag, uh
Head taps during traffic jams on the ave, uh
Think out the box while you still rockin' some plaid
Taking trips to the bank, mask off, get the bag, uh
You know how I rock, not no fuckin' Black Flag, uh
If he send a shot, got the 'K with the mag, uh
Up and down the block, spinning ‘round, doing laps, uh
Shit was always sunny till I pulled up with the MAC

[Verse]
She singing off-key, that's 'cause I fucked her from the back, uh
Niggas said they lost, so I told 'em get a map, uh
Stopped in yo' tracks, send that shit back to the trash, uh
Pop off yo' cap like a Snapple, that's a fact, uh
Niggas really wack, I dont mind statin' that, uh
I been 'bout my business but I kick it with the slacks
Check my bank account, it's digits while I sit at home, relaxed (Uh)
My flow tight like a fitted with the T-shirt print to match, uh
Flow could start a fire, y'all ain't really been a match, uh
Never gettin' past, Randy Moss with the catch
I'm breathing in the gas, ain't been wetting up a rag
Dropping bombs like Iraq and my kush Afghanistan, uh
Heat up like a pan, told my fans don't be a stan
Got the product with the plan, all detailing where we stand
Kept it a thousand like a grand, nipple rings on my hand
She gon' blow me like a fan, not the best I ever had (Uh)
If I fuck once, I don't gotta fuck again (Fuck)
Send her to the cab, don't come back without a friend (Fuck)
What does that mean? I'm only here to meet my ends (Fuck)
You can take my shirt, go 'head and suck me out the pants, huh (Fuck)
I been smokin' green, like some lean, like some plants
Celery, collard greens, coppin’ Ps for a snack
On her chest, where I rest
True indeed, that's a rack, uh
Bitch, I might bleed you
If I see you, that's a stack (Okay), huh
You might also like[Chorus]
You could get touched, bitch, we not playing tag, uh
Head taps during traffic jams on the ave, uh
Think out the box while you still rockin' some plaid
Taking trips to the bank, mask off, get the bag, uh
You know how I rock, not no fuckin' Black Flag, uh
If he send a shot, got the 'K with the mag, uh
Up and down the block, spinning ‘round, doing laps, uh
Shit was always sunny till I pulled up with the MAC1Embed
