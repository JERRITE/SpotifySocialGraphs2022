First Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1: Marcus]
I was thinking about how you look
With the moon lightin' up your eyes
You're in my head and my heart and I know it's right
I got your hand in my hand and I'm digging this thing
Digging this thing when you're looking like bling
Never let go, I'ma do what I know is right

[Pre-Chorus: Martinus]
And if could feel your lips tonight
I think I wanna do this every night
[Chorus: Marcus & Martinus]
You are my first kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
I think I'm in love
You are my first kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
I think I'm in love
You are my first, first, first kiss
Never knew it could feel, feel, feel like this

[Verse 2: Marcus]
I don't know if you know
When my friends may have said I'm a fool for you
And I'm feeling that fizz so hard like I always do
I know it's late, but I must say I'm digging this thing
Digging this thing when you're looking like bling
Never let go, I'ma do what I know is right

[Pre-Chorus: Martinus]
And if could feel your lips tonight
I think I wanna do this every night

[Chorus: Marcus & Martinus]
You are my first kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
I think I'm in love
You are my first kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
I think I'm in love
You are my first, first, first kiss
Never knew it could feel, feel, feel like this
You might also like[Bridge: Martinus]
Been dreaming of you for so long
So I really had you to write you this song
And I've been known to put my worst right out
But you make me go silent now
What can I say?

[Chorus: Marcus & Martinus]
You are my first (you are my first) kiss
Never knew it could feel like this
I think I'm in love
You are my first (first) kiss (kiss)
Never knew it could feel like this (feel like this)
I think I'm in love
You are my first, first, first kiss
Never knew it could feel, feel, feel like this
You are my first (you are my first), first, first kâ€‹iss
Never knew it could feel, feel, feel like this9Embed
