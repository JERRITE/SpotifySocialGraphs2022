Joints 2 Lyrics[Intro]
(Splurgeboys)

[Verse 1: Blade Brown]
10 10 that the fiends cop
Had them lining up like a supreme drop
If you talking hammers nigga seen lots
In the dope spot looking for a clean pot
I bought her Prada and she fucked me harder (She Did)
Jugg talk I gotta be the father (I Am)
Done alot of dirt gotta wait for the karma (Yeah)
I got it with me even in the barbers
When she sees the watch from Hattons, watch what happens
Follow the flow watch the pattern (Yeah)
Calm down nigga stop the cappin'
Im not lacking brudda I got the wap in
Walk up in the store they know me by my first name (First Name)
Pattern on the jeans but the shirt plain (Shirt Plain)
I did the money shuffle when the work came (Work Came)
Niggas tryna' get close tryna' work brain
[Chorus: Blade Brown & K-Trap]
Wrist wear, Swiss made (Swiss made)
Double R, switch lanes (Skrr)
Rolling with me but, I don't know this bitch name (I Dunno)
Trap boy (Trap boy), brick lane
10 10 (10), my whip game (Whip-Whip)
Foreign and me when the brick came (Came)
Clear view (View), big frames
357 thats a big tray (Bap-Bap)

[Verse 2: K-Trap]
Paro when I send for it calm and the re comes
99 problems but the mans never been one (No)
My only problems is how to put this machine away
Pointing out like an ID parade (Huh)
Who you know rap and still make it happen
I got coke on this Louis monogram, trap fashion (Uh)
Call my jewellers I think I want the mad ting
I think I brought the obbo up to Hatton
I'm in Louis AP with about 8 Gs
3 rollies, a patty face, 2 APs
Skeletons, I'm telling them (Tellin' Em)
Rainy day I hit the T in my Wellingtons (Yeah)
Good day she get a bag and her french tip nails
Helped me hit 10 brick sales (10 of them)
I put the fork in the pot and did a twirl (Twirl)
Heavy weight champ need a belt

Wrist wear, Swiss made (Swiss made)
Double R, switch lanes (Skrr)
Rolling with me but, I don't know this bitch name (I Dunno)
Trap boy (Trap boy), brick lane
10 10 (10), my whip game (Whip-Whip)
Foreign and me when the brick came (Came)
Clear view (View), big frames
357 thats a big tray (Bap-Bap)

[Outro: Blade Brown & K-Trap]
P-P-Paro when I send for it calm and the re comes
Jugg talk I gotta be the father
99 problems but the mans never been one
