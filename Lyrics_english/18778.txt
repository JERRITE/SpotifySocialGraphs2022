Funeral Bell Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinkin', drugged up
Completely shot to Hell
Left behind, ain't nothin' left to sell
Oh, ain't nothin' left to sell
The hatred of your blood
So tortured, so insane
Dead ends and lost hope
Keep runnin' through your veins
Oh, runnin' through your veins
[Chorus 1]
Oh-oh, so high, and then I fell
Oh-oh, can't stop the ringin' of my funeral bell

[Verse 2]
The loss of one's self
Inside the wheel of doom
Genocide is comin' way too soon
Oh, way too soon
The undying fear
The strength of one's demise
Broke and strung out
You wave yourself goodbye
Oh, goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Oh-oh, so high, and then I fell
Oh-oh, can't stop the ringin'
Oh-oh, so high, and then I fell
Oh-oh, can't stop the ringin' of my funeral bell

[Instrumental Break 2:58-3:44]

[Chorus 3]
Oh-oh, so high, and then I fell
Oh-oh, can't stop the ringin'
Oh-oh, so high, and then I fell
Oh-oh, can't stop the ringin' of my funeral bellYou might also like2Embed
