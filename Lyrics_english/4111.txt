Princess Lyrics ["Princess" letter]

[Intro: tini, karol g]
OH, UOH-OH, UOH-OH, UOH-OH
Yay-Yeah, Yay-Yeah
Uoh, oh
You have been imagining so long
Imagining us
We have not fulfilled that promise, that promise baby
If your fantasies play with my skin (OH)
My mouth with your honey
Baby, decide
Go crazy if you kiss you
[Chorus: Tini, Karol G]
And I will be your princess
I will be your princess all night
And in the castle we love each other
If you want to be my king, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown
And I will be your princess
I will be your princess all night
And anywhere we love each other
If you want to see, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown

[Verse 1: tini]
With that look that takes me to space
I don't love you soft or I love you slowly
You keep looking for me, I'm still losing myself
I don't want a prince who writes songs
If I have your love, I don't need reasons
You keep kissing me, and I keep wanting you

[Chorus: Tini, Karol G]
And I will be your princess
I will be your princess all night
And anywhere we love each other
If you want to see, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown
I will be your princess
I will be your princess all night
And in the castle we love each other
If you want to be my king, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown

I have dreamed so much
I thought love was not on my side
You arrived, you changed it
How nice it feels like being in love
If it's a dream and I woke up
I do not do it, that everything is more beautiful by your side
I know that I have dreamed you
By your side I have imagined
That you love me, that you move me away from the past
And for you everything is unexpected today
Stay with me, that everything is cutest by your side

[Chorus: Tini, Karol G]
And I will be your princess (OH)
All night I will be your princess (OH)
And in the castle we love each other (and in the castle we love ourselves)
If you want to be my king, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown
And I will be your princess (OH)
All night I will be your princess (OH)
And anywhere we love each other
If you want to see, we negotiate it
And with a kiss we crown

[Bridge: Tini, Karol G, Both]
You have been imagining me so long (imagining)
Imagining us (imagining ourselves)
We have not fulfilled that promise
[Chorus: Tini, Karol G, both]
And I will be your princess (ohh)
All night I will be your princess (ohh)
And in the castle we love each other (and in the castle, Baby)
If you want to be my king, we negotiate it (ohh)
And with a kiss we crown (Yea-Yeah)
And I will be your princess (princess)
I will be your princess (oh-uoh) all night
And anywhere we love each other (and in the castle, Baby)
If you want they see, we negotiate it (if you want to be my king)
And with a kiss we crown (with a kiss, baby)

[Outro: tini, karol g]
OH-OOH-OOH-OOH
YEA-YEA-YEAH (OHH)
And I will be your princess, ah-ah
And I will be, I will be your princess
I will be your princess
And we love each other (UH-OHH)
And we crowned (UHH) 1embed
