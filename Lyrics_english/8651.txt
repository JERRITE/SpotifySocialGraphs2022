Without a woman (Without a Woman) - Remastered 2007 Lyricsi Change the World
I Change the World
I Change the World
The Wanna Change the World

It is not so
What a step I pass
How are you...
You were there
And now I come back lady
Hey, who you are ...
I'm here and I look at the sea
I'm with me, I also feed myself
So it is like that, laugh as well but
I have no more fears to stay ...

Without a woman
How far we are
Without a woman
I'm fine tomorrow too
Without a woman
That made me die
Without a woman
Hah ... hah ...
It is better that way

It is not so
That you can buy me baby
You know it...
It is a little further down
What do you have to go lady (to the heart?)
Yes, if you have it

I have it you want to drink
Look at me, I'm a flower

Well not just like that
You laugh as well but
I have no more fears
To stay ...
You Might Also Likenza a woman
How far we are
Without a woman
I'm fine tomorrow too
Without a woman
That made me die

I'm here and I look at the sea
But why I keep talking

I don't know you laugh but
I have no more fears (maybe)
To stay ...

Without a woman
How far we are
Without a woman
I'm fine tomorrow too
Without a woman
That made me die
Without a woman
Come here, like on here

(Without a woman)
We are now close
(Without a woman)
I'm fine from tomorrow
(Without a woman)
Who made me die
