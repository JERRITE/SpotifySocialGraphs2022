[Verse 1: Exce]
Mere, you happen to you 'talking about me
But you don't live 'better than me (no!)
Bring him the hookah, that she never tells that
Never do not (never not)
This' greet me, but they have me sue
You do not charge 'what is "spending in bottle' (negative)
Do not compare you ', that you do not resemble you'
My name does not fit in your mouth (how crazy?)
You don't talk to your mouth full
[Chorus: Exce]
Today what I want and 'a shama (the e)
That moves my sheet
Bottle
The 'gretis are the ones who pay
What I want and 'a shama (ah, ah, ah, ah)
That moves my sheet (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Low 'always with fat (ah, ah, ah, ah)
And burning 'of molasses (ah, ah)

[Verse 3: gigolo]
Bubu
La Lale lit ', and it's weekend to' the day '
With the tola on top that takes care of envy
Woman for bag, read and here there is any breakdown
And riding smoke as a fireplace, he wigs it, he wiggled it
She has a couple of weight 'in that bat
Here Mandamo 'Nosotro', outside whatever happens whatever
Written me no matter how much they think it blocks me
I don't stop ', from mine, always goate
That 'they want to see me well, but well fucking'
Lower the bottle 'with the' Velone 'Pledge'
That they die of envy to 'that crowd
And give it, move that cha—

[Verse 4: Sheloow Shaq]
What I want and 'a shama that loves me on the bed (pu)
And that I dance this album with her Pinana ass (Ah!)
This disco 'tá vacana
There is a hookah atmosphere, but it smells like marijuana
With the 'fist' cerrao 'this pod I dance
Pulling battery 'e step', I don't care if I fall
Until 2070 I bring you (ah)
And a cibaeña said I have it Laigo
Until 2070 you, until 2070
Until 2070 I bring it to you (I bring), and
Until 2070 you, until 2070
And a cibaeña said I have it Laigo
