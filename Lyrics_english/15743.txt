Metropoli LyricsRuta Metropoli, Long live lights and flashes
There those Judas do not really laugh, smile and you will be like them
We were quick, jam and shortcuts, acquaintances that pass from afar
Veterans do not want to play anymore, because time has oxidized their bones

The hours you lose, the family out there
How many do you kill yourself? Brothers, colleagues
The polar third that this winter gives us
At least that's free, you don't pay

Tron, night and action
Party, wedge and heel pi-pijas
Today, good girls want to do evil
What is looking for distraction
The Corro School in the Park
Of crazy children for the weekend
In Sanman, 2D, the Trinchi, Grail and Olavide
Don't forget, don't forget

They throw you from bars, they fine you if you drink
I knew the best corners, do you know?
Don't think twice, live
Street pirates, Madrid my Caribbean

Families living from Apaños
Yonkis at Employee
Crooked stems dug their hole
They grew quickly, no, there was never time for essay

Individualism and serious character
Ganate the respect of your adversary
We recognize ourselves, the map is small
They are the same faces for years now

Breathe metropolis, live crime and passion
I kill me and I love her
La Cruzo Sentao 'in a car
The map that trace is mental because there is always a plan, an option

Native bro, time is right
The barman gives us a carafón
There heart is missing
At night pelaos, with a cold of the copon
You Might Also Likeal Pie of the Canyon, are my Men of Action
Barrio kids are small, the ribbon
They see, so close to temptation
You like and repeat, predisposition

Between blocks, the Law of Talion
Loads of guilt Los Bravos looking for forgiveness
Hold the pull
If there is always a plan an option

You hear the masters, fights
Staying looking is not a good idea
Ha-There is a fishing for each belt
And a Santa Claus in each fireplace

Raw habitat, concrete and break
Se-be known thoroughly when you kick
Gargolas jump from roof
You will know what is true when you see it

Breathe Live crime and passion metropolis
He kills me and I love her, kills me and I love her
Breathe Live crime and passion metropolis
He kills me and I love her, kills me and I love her
