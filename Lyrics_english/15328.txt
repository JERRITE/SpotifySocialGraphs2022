When we pass through, man!
A danger business! (Gunshot!)
So you know say, original bandelero man!

Hey, gringos on Pasero
I want you make way for the Bandelero
'Cuz if you don't do that, my friend, then your number is zero
Dem lyrics a chop like the sword of Zorro

When I buck up di youth, Franco Nero
When the horse, it a kick up, and a gallop, and the caravan stay so
