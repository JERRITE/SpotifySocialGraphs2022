TranslationsEspañolLove You Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
This could be your year
If you let go of the loneliness you fear
‘Cause I know that you’ve been trying so hard (yeah)
Don’t you know it’s alright
For just a little while ’cause it made us feel alive

[Chorus]
But at the same time
We can’t belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We're wasting all each other's youth
If I could love you back I would
[Verse 2]
This could be your year
Cause your life could take you somewhere new from here
When you’re on your own
You’ll look back and see I’m
Just a moment in time
And we gave it a try ‘cause it made us alive

[Chorus]
But at the same time
We can’t belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We’re wasted on each other
It’s you
If I could love you back I would

(If I could love)
(Come on now)

[Chorus]
But at the same time
We can’t belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We’re wasted on each other
It’s you
If I could love you back I would
You might also like[Outro]
Let’s belong together, what does
Let’s belong together, what does
Let’s belong together, what does
Let’s belong together, what doesEmbed
