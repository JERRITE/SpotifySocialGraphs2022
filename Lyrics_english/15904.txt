In this no lyrics [letter of "in this no"]

[See 1]
In this no
I don't have to be the one who loves you
Nor does it have to make the bed together
Nor give rope to this clock
In this no
Our universes do not match
Nor can we write a verse
Describe our love
[See 2]
In this no
We don't have to walk the world
Nor travel to the deepest
Of this sky that opened
In this no
Our history never started ....

[Chorus]
Maybe in another life
I can give you everything I feel now
Maybe in another life
I touch your body to contemplate the dawn
Maybe in another life we ​​are you and me
And sing our skin with the same voice
Maybe in another life
Drink all those desires from your mouth
Maybe in another life
This distant love shortens distances
Maybe in another life we ​​give us the light
Maybe in another life you are first you
In this life no

In this no
We don't have to tell us: "I love you"
Nor take care of the little money
That has remained in the drawer
In this no
Although it hurts so much to accept it
And I want to give
What burns my heart
You Might Also Like [Bridge]
In this no
Our history never started

[Chorus]
Maybe in another life
I can give you everything I feel now
Maybe in another life
I touch your body to contemplate the dawn
Maybe in another life we ​​are you and me
And sing our skin with the same voice
Maybe in another life
Drink all those desires from your mouth
Maybe in another life
This distant love shortens distances
Maybe in another life we ​​give us the light
Maybe in another life you are first you
In this life no

[Outro]
Maybe in another life we ​​give us the light
Maybe in another life you are first you
In this life no
In this life, Noembed
