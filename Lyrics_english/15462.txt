Damn shyness Lyricsaqu√≠ you have me, facing you
I do not break a dish, I look happy
And while inside
I burn so slowly
I would like to kiss you, until the last breath
Look at my face, as a child well
Sweet and quiet, as it should be
But any day, I fall on you
And it would tear you up, to the shirt

[Chorus]
But you see it, I have no value
I don't know how to do, and tell you
I am like an oxygen fish
After the lukewarm of your lips
But you see it, I have no value
I have my heart
Out of control
I am a snail
With introversion
Who dies of silent love
Ehh ehh ehh damn shyness
It's damn shyness
Eh curse shyness huh eh

Do not be wrong, or think badly
My subconscious speaks of more
But any day I fall on you
And it would tear you up to the shirt
But you see it, I have no value
I do not know how to do
And tell you
I am like an oxygen fish
After the lukewarm of your lips

[Chorus]
But you see it, I have no value
I have the heart, out of control
I am a snail with introversion
Who dies of silent love
Ehh ehh ehh damn shyness
It's damn shyness
Ehh eh damn shyness huh eh

But you see it, I have no value
I don't know how to do, and tell you
I am like an oxygen fish
After the lukewarm of your lips
But you see it, I have no value
I have my heart
Out of control
I am a snail
With introversion
Who dies of a quiet love might also likembed
