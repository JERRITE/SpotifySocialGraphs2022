Hot Tea Lyrics[Verse 1]
I really do wanna be crashing into Your shore
Wrapping all around You
Sinking to the ground floor, ocean deep
Wanna be here at Your door at 12 AM
And sleeping on Your porch until You get in

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking into Your eyes (Endlessly)
Falling into Your lap (Desperately)
Sitting at Your feet, soaking in all Your energy
Sip You through my front teeth (Held too close)
[Chorus]
(Ooh) Hold You in my hands like hot tea
Knowing I'm safe 'cause You want me
(Ooh) Sitting in a garden at Your feet
You, me, only, holding on and on
Clawing at the corner of my heart, I
Can't afford to lose You any longer
(Ooh) Holding You like hot tea
You, me, only, holding on and on
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I wanna be ruined by love
Drowning in rivers of peace
Taking a piece of the cut
Longing for everything
Take it all in life-sized bites, I'ma be outside
Up all night in the stars
Pale moonrise, longing for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
(Looking into Your eyes) Endlessly
(Falling into Your lap) Desperately
(Sitting at Your feet) Soaking in all Your energy
Oh, right now, I wanna be (Held too close)

(Ooh) Hold You in my hands like hot tea
Knowing I'm safe 'cause You want me
(Ooh) Sitting in a garden at Your feet
You, me, only, holding on and on
Clawing at the corner of my heart, I
Can't afford to lose You any longer
(Ooh) Holding You like hot tea
You, me, only, holding on and on

[Outro]
Hold You in my hands like hot tea
Knowing I'm safe 'cause You want me
Sitting in a garden at Your feet
You and me only, holding on and on (On and on)
Clawing at the corner of my heart, I (On and on)
Can't afford to lose You any longer
Holding You like hot tea
You and me only, holding on and on3Embed
