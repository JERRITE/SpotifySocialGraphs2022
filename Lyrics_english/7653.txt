[Verse 1]
She a certified bitch (Certified)
Thoroughbred bitch (Thoroughbred)
She a boss bitch, get her bread bitch (Get her bread bitch)
Ass on thick, she a well-fed bitch (Ooh)
Unapologetic, see, I said what I said, bitch (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Got more Chanel than Chanel (That's a fact)
Lacefront, couldn't even tell (That ain't cap)
Coordinate, gotta make the bag match the nails (Ooh)
Them hatin' hoes never get her mad, She just wish 'em well (Hello?)
[Chorus]
Pussy on Febreze (Mm)
And she keep it bald, Mr. Clean (Mm)
Left, right, left, right, puttin' on her jeans (Ooh, ooh)
She not a bitch, she a queen (Ooh, ooh)
But if you say a bitch, say she that bitch (Say she that bitch)
And if you say a bitch, say a bad bitch (Say a bad bitch)
She bad in the real life, she no catfish (She not no catfish)
This not a man song (No), this the bad bitch anthem (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2]
Got a short temper, but her bands long (Her bands long)
She finesse anything she put her hands on (Uh-huh)
She gon' twerk to this, turn it to a dance song (Twerk, twerk)
It's on her playlist, all you hear is, "Ayy, ayy, ayy, bitch"
And she fuck it up, she fuck it up, ooh (Fuck it up, fuck it up)
Got a house, got a car, got the truck too (Got the skrt, got the skrt)
She a dime, she a boss, she a thug too (She a thug)
Sip wine, drink Henny, hit the blunt too (Hit the blunt), ooh

[Chorus]
Pussy on Febreze
And she keep it bald, Mr. Clean (Mm)
Left, right, left, right, puttin' on her jeans (Put it on, put it on)

And if you say a bitch, say a bad bitch (Say a bad bitch)
She bad in the real life, she no catfish (She not no catfish)
This not a man song, this the bad bitch anthem (This the bad, ooh, ooh)
