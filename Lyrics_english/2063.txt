I danced with my former lyrics ["I danced with my ex"]

[Verse 1]
At dawn
I'm coming and you waiting for me in bed
I misapersed to put on my pajamas
Impossible not to make noise with everything I have drunk, and wake up with a:
"How did it go?" I had a good time
Dance all night, "But with whom?"
We went to several place ', the truth was not in my plans
If I get late to the house it is because
[Chorus]
I danced with my ex
And he felt like the first time
Going around the hours, we were alone
I'm glad to see him too
I danced with my ex
I don't want it to happen again
I found it, we dance and relive when we met
I'm glad to see that he is doing well too
I danced with my ex

[Verse 2]
You will not believe me, you will think there is something else
It's hard to understand it, but I wouldn't be able to deceive you
And if I tell you
It's because I am very clear about what I feel
He for me is a memory
Even if I don't remember
How happened, or at what time
It was for things of destiny that occurred
We looked at each other and our song sounded

[Chorus]
I danced with my ex
And he felt like the first time
Going around the hours, we were alone
I'm glad to see that he is doing well too
I danced with my ex
I don't want it to happen again
I found it, we dance and relive when we met
I'm glad to see that he is doing well too
