TranslationsEspañolThe Key to Life on Earth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gold, let it unfold
And imagine you're dressed in gold
Roaring crowds in Manchester would manage to be told
Oh, and your king, the boy you loved in spring
The way she looks at him
The common goal, and waiting for the kids to go

[Chorus]
We've been held back for after-school meetings
They've got it in for me
For all it's worth
The key to life on Earth
Jokers, happy go xenophobe locals
Have got it in for me
For all I'm worth
The key to life on Earth
[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Holy smokes
You kids and your jokes
Asking where we got our jeans
And where the hell we found our coats
'Cause dirty streets these days are graced
By Nikes of black and green
And headstrong boys in chinos
Barely grasp what that could mean
And they lie, the men that wrung us dry
The boys who poked your eye
The common fool, the walk to school for you and I

[Chorus]
We've been held back for after-school meetings
They've got it in for me
For all it's worth
The key to life on Earth
The thing is, these out-of-touch scrounging rich kids
Are living here for free
On my home turf
The key to life on Earth

[Bridge]
Call in to wake you up in the morning (Morning)
Iron your suit and tie forever until you die
Join forces, like carousels and their horses
Forever spinning 'round
And never coming down

Come out and join us, honey, we will sort you out
Come work in Brookfield Park and we can shut your mouth
Come work in Sainsbury's, babe, until you've had enough
Come on out, come on out, come on out, come on out
Come out and join us, honey, we will sort you out
Come work in Brenley Farm and we can shut your mouth
Come work in Sainsbury's, babe, until you've had enough
Come on out, come on out, come on out, come on out19Embed
