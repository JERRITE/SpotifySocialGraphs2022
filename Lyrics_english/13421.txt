Tomb the house (remix) Lyrics [letter of "tomb the house (remix)" ft. Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, Farruko, Archangel, De la Ghetto, Zion & Ñengo Flow]

[Verse 1: from the ghetto & dj Luian]
You have a booty, mommy, too ridiculous
Another chapter, give up the show
That 'giant' sheet '
Imagine to 'that here
Earthquake alert, with that it shakes the building
Much 'Like' and when I upload it in G-String
An abuser who is solid
And give that, Baby, Amérita
(This is the remix!)
[Verse 2: Nicky Jam & Dj Luian]
I want the house to lie, mommy (that is)
Telling you ma ', I want to feel your body when you hit you' (Orion)
You have 'crazy, mommy (Alexio)
I can't lie, I have to say, I'm going to admit it I'm looking for a woman (El Remix)
Like you who do it well
What you ask me to give you
But before putting 'in that (Nicky Jam)
Let's endure the process and I start with this (Ah!)

[Coro: Alexio, Zion & Both]
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can
That with that booty you can (zion, baby)
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can
And that abdomen, you can also

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee & Dj Luian]
(Dy!)
But you want the selfies, which I am well released
Way in the air, because of 'e la' perqui '
Combi well fresh beach, puerquis borders
The girls see us and get wet like jet ski
Oh Lord, have mercy, we walk without persi
Even if you see me with Jordan, goals like Messi
Tumbo almost with my easy chapi
Already stop the photo, they look like paparazzi
They reinforce the column (EH), they leave one (EH)
That we already put the GPS for the moon
They threw for the Celus, on the networks and the scanners
That I left in the remix, we spent in Chipijel

That platinum booty, no jeweler did (no)
The house and Puerto Rico rumble (bom)
You don't eat it if you're a pesetero (aha)
She likes gánster, bosses and killeros (like me)
Addicted to the sound of guys and motor
And it seems that he puts the Gym 24 hours a day (Nice)
You have nothing simple (vamo ')
But you lose your fineness with alcohol and a pill (OH)
Give the guaro, turn on a rooster
As if we were in Medallo (yes)
Ponte Luci ', give the tussi
With a couple of friends, you and me in the pool or in the jacuzzi
(The witch!)

[Verse 5: Alexio]
The baby does not respect ranges, or boot
To the one who gets sweet down the note
Ball, she is told the problem
Picamo 'Solo' and now we made Remix to the subject
That the vua ', that little movie Black Nalgona without making squats
It is no longer the Indian, it is the arrow, it has to ', it is not made
That is why the envious walk right
They suspect that I am like Maicol and Manuel
For the girl who likes the six
So they see Michu-Michu, Ven, Gatita
Come Michu-Michu, come (ay)
[Chorus: Alexio]
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can
That with that booty you can
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can
And that abdomen, you can also

[Verse 6: Nicky Jam & Dj Luian]
(Tell me daddy; Nicky Jam)
She wants the one who kills in views and events explodes
The one who arrived alone and now comes with the fleet
The one who sings pretty so loosen the boot '
That I am the one who makes her move that buttock
They open their way, don't look at me clown '
That booty owns and is not going to listen to you
She rave the house, when she moves
I am the only one who has what he transfers
I violate me, every time I catches me alone '
Says no more na 'that hurts to the tail
I already took off the piqui, but my pipi works
You rumbleing the house from Medallo to Carola

[Verse 7: from the ghetto & dj Luian]
(Tell Geezy)
M-m-mete thousands surgeries, zero fat, without strie '(uh)
The envious are biting because they have everything left '
Daddy is hard, he trusts, he leaves you as psychiatry '
Control all networks, take a thousand follows a day

[Bridge: De la Ghetto]
Grave the house, mom, you have the power
Anyone convince, as you move '
Think that to 'pa'trás, echa-echa that to' pa'trás
Pa 'to try it'
Grave the house, mom, you have the power
Anyone convince, as you move '
Think that to 'pa'trás, echa-echa that to' pa'trás
Pa 'to try it'

[Verse 8: Farruko, Dj Luian & Ñengo Flow]
(Hahahaha; Farruko!; Farru!)
Tomba the house, with to 'and tormentera
That the hurricane arrived, nobody leaves pa'fuera
A berry macal entered, crawl to the wax
If you invade me the lane I will impact your rear area
Because your hand went
You were well done by those buttocks, salúd me to the surgeon
Mami, get off the mahón that there is a search warrant '
I get you 'on the album and we lower the de'o
Hey, there is a lot of shark there on the prowl
Mommy, I am going to lie down the roof
I want to see all that power
I am not your country but that ass is mine (hahahahaha)

[Coro: Alexio, Ñengo Flow & Both]
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can
That with that booty you can
Tomb the house, mommy, tomb the house, mommy
That with that face you can (real g4 life, motherfucker)
And that abdomen, you can also

[Verse 9: Ñengo Flow & Dj Luian]
(Ñengo Flow! Real G!)
Grave the house and take revenge
Move the booty-booty fly, mai, to see what happens
Steel buttock, gondote ass
He has spending the case to 'Los Cocorote'
And do not explode, put pa 'that janguee in the boat
Skate on his puddle when the toto scourges him
Leave the 'threat', daughter 'and whore the house, you
Tell it Alexio, Bellaquera is my race

[Verse 10: Zion & Dj Luian]
(Z-Diddy)
Many carats on the neck
Tomba the house, baby, which I arrived (z-diddy)
Became whole in Medallo
I can throw with my eyes closed to the booty, I don't fail (Night City)
She is the one who rave the house
The one that many do not support
With none of these lazy people marries
He likes the type 'with cake
And if you don't have 'fat
Pa 'do not look that there is no way
Your economic life is based
With little she does not conform
