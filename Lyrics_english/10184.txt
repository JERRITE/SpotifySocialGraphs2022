Youâ€™re Not Harry Styles Lyrics[Intro]
Better, better
Better, better
Better, better

[Verse 1]
Better, does it make you feel a little bit better?
When you're messing with my head for pleasure
You ain't tall enough to act like that
You're loveless
Is that a symptom of being gorgeous?
Whatever happened to being modest
You ain't good enough to treat me bad
[Pre-Chorus]
To you I'm overly emotional, easily replaceable
Overthinking dumb blonde
Who never got her shit together

[Chorus]
You think you can do better
Must of hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your God complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better
Maybe I deserve better

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
Better, better
Better, better

[Verse 2]
Honest, yeah you aren't supposed to solve all my problems
Yet you're a piece of work that I've fallen
It would be better if you left me back

[Pre-Chorus]
To you I'm overly emotional, easily replaceable
Overthinking dumb blonde
Who never got her shit together
You might also like[Chorus]
You think you can do better
Must of hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your God complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better

[Bridge]
I know that I'm overly emotional, easily replaceable
Even I can admit that
But you're a egotistic maniac
Who never says the L word back
Guess you really met your match, bitch
You think you can do better

[Chorus]
You think you can do better
Must of hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your God complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better
Well, maybe I deserve better

[Outro]
Maybe I deserve better
Maybe I deserve better
Better
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit?2Embed
