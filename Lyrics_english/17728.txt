Next Up France - S1 -E4 Lyrics [Words of "Next Up France - S1 -E4" Ft. Django]

[Intro]
DE-DE-DEF BEATS TO THE Dirty (To The Dirty)
Yeah yeah
Hey
Hey

[Unique verse]
When I speak, shut up, it's the normal gesture, there are eagles, pigeons, I'm fucking corbac
Bad alcohol, insortable man, I was not invited, I broke the gate
Fuck this bitch ass, is that one night, no feeling, I met your father, with me, he is shy
Checke your friends, they all know Billy, Billy, shit, it's still not over
The reufs in the tchop, I'm invincible, will fuck your mother, if if, I insist
Nobody listens to you when you speak, my reuf, it's p't- being a message, it's p't- being a sign
Know very much but do not try anything, will rasse his mother like on the 31st
Pair of doc, every day on my 31, without problem, I get away on the big ground
The last time we wanted to give me, he released something, he is part in a falsard
Big Man, in life, no chance, it must be deserved to wear the armband
I wasted too much time with too many people, it's fucking fake ass
She dares not to order a photo, it was wanted, I know very well what I deliver
Today, I do what I want to do, I'm not proud, brother, you can do it too
When I'm in a good mood, I seem hostile, more than half of my life, the same broskis
Left, right, left, prod ', I hit the dirty, feeling of cold in the backbone
Pilot the BM as if it were forza, it's not good for me but shit, I love it
"Django, how is it in real life?", Very far from you and your shit questions
Boy, success is a hell of a tchoin, it can very quickly make you the reason to lose (PAH)
Your rappers, they may write but I listen to once, I remember it
P't-being on youtube, they look too much scales, I met them, I both put it heads
No cap, five stars on paname, the gadji of the reception does not want to recover
No pillz, no coke, no sky, no smoke but I fuck every day, to each his remedy (OH)
I have everything, however, Zehef all the time, full of mala, they are steep (they are stiff, ouh)
Fuck, I'm dead, even the condes listen to me in Scred
I remember me at eighteen rods, on the peripheh, Khabat on a runner
I am told that today, I'm not easy but at the time, I have never given you the time
Full vase, water flows, I don't like it a lot, I could offend even sound goku
Too many bits around, too much vulture, I do not cuddle, I say no sweet words
Big, there is no "if I had known" (pah), should not know certainty (pah)
I have one, two, three or four that count on me and I can count SSUS (EH, GRR)
Big, there is no "if I had known" (pah), had to know how to get certain (pah)
I have one, two, three or four that count on me and I can count ssus
My mouth, for us, there was no evening, all weekend with the zien on Kino der toten
Rue d'O Montreuil, big, it was the bohemian, make me a grime, whore, I make a poem
I'm in the stud 'with Big Man, go ahead, he saw me grow, he knows the Gringo well
Being on me, I don't know, igo, badly seen everywhere because we are parigos ('Rigos) you might also likembed
