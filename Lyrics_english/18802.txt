​circle the drain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna be calm like the soft
Summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders
But everything just brings me back down
To the cold hard ground
And it keeps getting colder
It's a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame
But I'm not sure I'm able
I'm wobbling out on the wire
And the lights could go out
With the break of a cable
[Pre-Chorus]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to seem strong for my love
For my family and friends
But I'm so tired of faking
'Cause I'm chained to my bed when they're gone
Watching TV alone
'Til my body starts aching
And I think there's a mold in my brain
Spreading down all the way
Through my heart and my body
'Cause I cling to the dark of my room
And the days thin me out
Or just burn me straight through

Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Bridge]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down5Embed
