Electric Eye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Up here in space, I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape, I’m watching all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Verse 2]
Always in focus, you can’t feel my stare
I zoom into you, but you don’t know I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Outro]
I'm elected electric spy
I'm elected, protected, detective, electric eye8Embed
