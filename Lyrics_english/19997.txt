All White Funeral Lyrics[Intro]
Helix

[Hook]
They say, love doesn't cost a thing
Then, why the fuck did it cost me my life?
I'm so numb, I guess that I'm alright
Make sure you pull up to my funeral in all-white
They say, love doesn't cost a thing
Then, why the fuck did it cost me my life?
I'm so numb, I guess that I'm alright
Make sure you pull up to my funeral in all-white
[Verse]
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
When I was young, I almost died in the living room
I was ten years old, tryna find a clue
I was nothing like you, nothing like you
Fuck that, two bitches on me going both ways
Two nights full of sex so I slept both days
Pull up in a big body bumpin' Ghostemane
Big ass truck, watch it take up both lanes
I just bought a new chain, bust-down diamonds
But, that don't help with the pain, my heart still crying
Bitch, can you tell the truth, can you stop lying?
I wipe my tears on my shirt and they're still drying
Don't say you love me, 'cause you don't mean it
You only love me when I fuck that pussy like a demon
Don't say you love me, 'cause you don't mean it
You only love me when I fuck that pussy like a demon

[Hook]
They say, love doesn't cost a thing
Then, why the fuck did it cost me my life?
I'm so numb, I guess that I'm alright
Make sure you pull up to my funeral in all-white
They say, love doesn't cost a thing
Then, why the fuck did it cost me my life?
I'm so numb, I guess that I'm alright
Make sure you pull up to my funeral in all-whiteYou might also likeEmbed
