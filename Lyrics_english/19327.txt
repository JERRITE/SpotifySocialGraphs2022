Trust In Me Lyrics[Chorus]
I really f**ked it up cause you put all your trust in me
I said I ain’t J.I. but I need a little company
And I broke your heart so now i’m takin all the custody
Everytime we talk we just came to do it comfortably

You know i’m only f**kin with the b**ch if she lookin like Kylie
I need a freak snow bunny like Miley
This drip costs money yea you know it’s really pricey, i’m runnin up these checks I ain’t talkin bout no nike

[Verse 1]
Fem’s f**kin for the clout at the function
And they’re givin brain and they usin’ all the suction
No Stone Cold but i’m flexin and stunnin
Like a track meet i’ll have this whole party f**kin runnin’
And you know I treat the b**ch like some liquor I don’t chase her
Tryna be in L.A. like a Laker
No i ain’t no Kane i’m going under imma taker
Runnin up this town think I might just be the mayor
I said
Stop, b**ch listen
I don’t want no beef i’m just tryna get this chicken
I swear i just want the top cause I ain’t tryna do no kissin
Yea i’m really finna blow really soon time is tickin

You know i skirt up off the scene shootin clips not no movies
Pull up to the spot and make it hot like a jacuzzi
On my Mike Myers s**t yea i’m finna get real spooky
If you f**k with the gang you get smoked like a loosey

[Chorus]
I really f**ked it up cause you put all your trust in me
I ain’t J.I. but i need a little company
And i broke your heart so now i’m takin all the custody
Everytime we talk we just came to do it comfortably

You know i’m only f**kin with the b**ch if she lookin like Kylie
I need a freak snow bunny like Miley
This drip costs money yea you know it’s really pricey, i’m runnin up these checks i ain’t talkin bout no nike

[Verse 2]

I said b**ch i’m in my bag in my pocket like i’m Brady, spazzing on the beat yea i’m going really crazy
My flow is an infection i ain’t talkin no rabies
Get my mama out the ford and in a new Mercedes
You might also likeI got Plan B i ain’t talkin pills
But i gotta Plan A i’m finna touch a mil, yea this rap s**t gon’ work thinkin bout it gives me chills
Soon i’m finna blind y’all with all the diamonds in my grill

How you talking hella hard but your crew is really sweet
My b**ch is on the low keep my b**ch real discreet
Yea you payin for the p**sy when I always get it free
I was flipping on the and you were coppin all the pleas

[Chorus]

I really f**ked it up cause you put all your trust in me
I ain’t J.I. but i need a little company
And i broke your heart so now i’m takin all the custody
Everytime we talk we just came to do it comfortably

You know i’m only f**kin with the b**ch if she lookin like Kylie
I need a freak snow bunny like Miley
This drip costs money yea you know it’s really pricey, i’m runnin up these checks i ain’t talkin bout no nikeEmbed
