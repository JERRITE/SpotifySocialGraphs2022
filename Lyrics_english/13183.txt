Neon Signs Lyrics[Verse 1]
I follow the neon signs to your heart
I follow, follow the neon signs
And I can't help feelin' trouble
Trouble, trouble, I can't hide

[Chorus]
Free yourself up from the shackles of your dreams (Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)
Tell me, what do they mean? (Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)

[Verse 2]
That's what happens when you believe delusions
A broken heart is a fucking nuisance
A fusion of needs movin' as one
Until one starts to bleed
[Chorus]
Free yourself up from the shackles of dreams
Because the best break is one that is clean

[Verse 3]
I follow the neon signs to your heart
I follow, follow the neon signs
When you're so far, baby, I struggle
I know you're crazy, but I don't mind

[Chorus]
Free yourself up from the shackles of your dreams (Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)
Tell me, what do they mean? (Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble)

[Verse 4]
Your guard dog needn't do very much
The parking lot around you feels pretty rough
And there's dust pilin' up on the rust of your steez
Funny how lust can keep us from peace

[Chorus]
Free yourself up from the shackles of dreams
Because the best break is one that is clean

[Bridge]
I fell down the rabbit hole
Sold my soul for total control
I fell down the rabbit hole
Sold my soul for total control
You might also like[Outro]
Total control, total control
(Control, control, control, control)
(Control, control, control, control)
