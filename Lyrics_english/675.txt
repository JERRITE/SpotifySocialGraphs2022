512 Lyrics [letter from "512"]

[Pre-Caro: Jhay Cortez & Mora]
Today says that I later 'from the' twelve
I later 'of the' twelve, after the 'twelve
And walk in truck 'that seem chop'
They seem to chop ', which seem to chop'

[Chorus: Jhay Cortez & Mora]
She moves her ass for enjoying it
To enjoy it, to enjoy it
It always gives wine and 512
And at 512, and at 512
[Verse 1: Jhay Cortez]
At 512
Girl, tell your boyfriend to leave the closet
A vece 'baby red, a vece' baby rosé
Drunk Toíta 'Sing "does not know me"
I know that it has no cat for
What E 'Bellaqueo wants, on the beach of Ocean Park
Has the half retro flow, a vece 'use vans
It has an envious torque ', but they don't give it
The 'bottle' going down, the note up
She moves that ass for seeing who tá seeing
The 'drink' arrives without being 'asking
Much 'speaking shit and much shit eating
The night is pa 'pasto and fight
He doesn't play ball, but Pichea
He doesn't sell drugs ', but to'a' the flow they fall
The denture was made, neither the sun whites it
Baby always beautiful, never ugly
That is normal, that and 'routine
They say that the 'ma' *** (ey, ey), a vece 'are the' fine '
Enchele Premium, likes gasoline
Smokes and gets China
I marry if he fucks like kitchen

[Chorus: Mora & Jhay Cortez]
She moves her ass for enjoying it
To enjoy it, to enjoy it
It always gives wine and 512
And at 512, and at 512
She moves her ass for enjoying it
To enjoy it, to enjoy it
She gives the wine and 512
And at 512, and at 512

The one that spends missioning, that e 'my shorty
He always escapes, but and 'that she never puts a story'
He likes to move his ass for throwing money
He has a gringo kitten, but e 'that she wants a bori
That he puts her to sweat and eat her enter the seat 'e attrá'
Envious' They see her well and want to comment
They do not reach their level and want to snore
Baby, Vámono ', but Lejo'; I give that ass
But I don't fight ', because that's why I leave
I was a child, Baby, even if the asshole
This' they see me and 'gives complex'

[Bridge: Mora]
And the Baby E 'fine, ah
But he gave him down in the 'partie' of Marquesina
And already 'routine
Not 'comamo' even in the cabin
It has discipline
It comes without warning and knows that it fascinates me
I give it premium if you ask for gasoline
She and 'a gangster cat, but of the' fine '

[Pre-car: Mora]
And today he said that I after the 'twelve
I later 'of the' twelve, after the 'twelve
And walk in truck 'that seem chop'
They seem to chop ', which seem to chop'
[Chorus: Jhay Cortez & Mora]
She moves her ass for enjoying it
To enjoy it, to enjoy it
She gives the wine and 512
And at 512, and at 512
