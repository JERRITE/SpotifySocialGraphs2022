What you lost lyrics that you don't want anymore
That you have put it in oblivion
Just dare to release her
You will give accounts that never
There may be someone like her
Just dare to release her
You will give accounts that never
There may be someone so beautiful

Nobody knows what they have
Until I lost it
And you will understand very late
Pride will take you
To a destination of oblivion
No one knows what you
Until I lost it
You will already understand very late
When you go far
That was the most dear
The garden already wilt
It will be greener to the other side
If the plot you have neglected
Put to water where you are
And so the flowers will relive
If the plot you have neglected
Put to water where you are
And so will love

Nobody knows what they have
Until I lost it
And you will understand very late
Pride will take you
To a destination of oblivion
Nobody knows what they have
Until I lost it
And you will understand very late
When you go far
That was the most dear

And you will understand very late
When you go far ...
That was the most dear ... You Might Also Likeembed
