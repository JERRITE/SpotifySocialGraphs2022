Magnetic Lyrics[Verse 1: Traphik]
It feels like springtime, sunshine on my window
My heart skipping and beating a different tempo!
She so dope I don't need no endo
We're so drawn together no pencils
What is this feeling I'm feeling, I don't get it
I'm kinda nervous but baby I'm so ready
They try to bring us down but no we won't let it
And if haters are talking shit then say "fuck 'em" and forget it
It's you and me just groovin' to the beat
So fluently even my crew can see
That I never ever felt this it's so new to me
So I'm clinging to your waist like that Louis V
It's like a scene that's so cliche
So meant to be it's the only way
So, say goodbye to them lonely days
Now we're on cloud 9, let's float away
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
You stay cool when life gets hectic
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Feel like I can never get close enough
I'm so drawn to you, magnetic
Baby what'ya doing? What're you doin' to me?
Tuggin' on my heart, never pull it away

[Verse 2: Traphik]
You and me baby two peas in a pod
Too good to be true like she's a mirage
When she walks by people freeze and applaud
Atheists see her bod and believe in god, yeah
One kiss is like crack to me
Like a trip to the sugar shack factory
She keep it cooler than strawberry daiquiris
So sweet that your scent be attracting bees
Snow White, Cinderella, you're my Jasmine
Every other girl I knew is a has-been
Making me wanna sing and tap dance
Because I'm feeling like spring in past tense
And they probably won't get that right away
It's okay, just wanna dance the night away
So let's go, take my hand and fly
Because this here is a connection we can't deny
You might also like[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
You stay cool when life gets hectic
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Feel like I can never get close enough
I'm so drawn to you, magnetic
Baby what'ya doing? What're you doin' to me?
Tuggin' on my heart, never pull it away

[Verse 3: Traphik]
M is for the magic that brought us here
A is for the attraction that pulled us near
G is for the greatness we're destined for
N is for that nasty behind closed doors
E is for the experience for things we do
T is for the time that I'll commit to you
I is for intense just like my feelings and
C's for the way you take me, baby, through the ceiling
..Yeah

[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
This magnetic connection, got all this attraction towards you
Can't pull away nor do I want to
This magnetic connection, got all this attraction towards you
Can't pull away nor do I want to

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
You stay cool when life gets hectic
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Feel like I can never get close enough
I'm so drawn to you, magnetic
Baby what'ya doing? What're you doin' to me?
Tuggin' on my heart, never pull it away3Embed
