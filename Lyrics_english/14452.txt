Among us Lyrics [letter from "among us"]

[Verse 1: Tiago Pzk]
A while ago I do not sleep with vo '
I think how everything worn out
I feel you a little more 'rare
I no longer cause you anything
I feel bigger the bed
What has happened?
I would like to meet your expectations
I can't pretend what I am not
I dream that someday wants to be mine
But it demands everything but love
[Pre-stribe: Tiago Pzk]
I swear I don't want anything, but when I approach I want to '
I don't want to hurt myself and hit the same wall twice
I want that poison that poisoned me
I am the loser of the two, of the do ', oh-oh

[Chorus: tiago pzk]
Baby, tell me, oh-oh
What happened, OH-OH?
Between antotro 'do', oh-oh
Something broke, oh-oh
And don't tell me about master-or-or
If my heart-e-eion
I never cared, no, no
Baby, tell me, oh-oh
What happened, OH-OH?
Between antotro 'do', oh-oh
Something broke, oh-oh
And don't tell me about master-or-or
If my heart-e-eion
You never cared, no, no, not-not

[Verse 2: Lit Killah]
I said I wasn't going to hurt you, I did it again
Whenever I start to think you rain
I got tired of writing your name on the paper sheet
No 'Queremo' but I don't 'do' bad (no 'want' but I don't 'do' bad)
And that bothers
He does not realize that he hurts me when I call her and does not answer
Of love to hate, night 'night looking for answers
I already know that play
Don't lie to my face (no), no, no, no
which he makes pay
And karma already has a debt with you and I know that
That you are tired of seeing me lost
It makes no sense to try again
Don't repeat something that I already know
Uncontable 'I see' that I failed
You weren't you, I also cried you
But I learned and then I released you

Baby, tell me, oh-oh
What happened, OH-OH?
Between antotro 'do', oh-oh
Something broke, oh-oh
And don't tell me about master-or-or
If my heart-e-eion
I never cared, no, no
Baby, tell me, oh-oh
What happened, OH-OH?
Between antotro 'do', oh-oh
Something broke, oh-oh
And don't tell me about master-or-or
If my heart-e-eion
You never cared, no, no, no-no2embed
