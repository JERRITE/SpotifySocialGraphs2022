Strawberry Letter 23 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see
West purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flower echo from a cherry cloud
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh, If you try to ask, "Is it cool?"
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be

[Chorus]
With my baby
I am free
Flying in her arms
Over the sea

[Verse 2]
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays
I sit in for a few

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-oohYou might also like5Embed
