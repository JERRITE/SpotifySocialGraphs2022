Four Letter Word Lyrics[Verse 1]
Broke me that day I remember
I waited for my stubborn to come through
Told me why my moods ain't easy
Challenge me like I do you
This feeling takes me back to never
I pray I get the chance to bloom
I can be a six letter word, but four letter word is you

[Pre-Chorus]
B-A-B-Y
This just changed my life
Can't believe I, can't believe I, can't believe I don't have time
B-A-B-Y
I talk to you at night
Won't believe I, won't believe I, won't believe I won't have time
[Chorus]
'Cause someone's right for me, waiting
To feel all my love and make you with me
I'll never give up, even if it breaks me
Feels in my heart, we'll meet one another
You'll be my baby, and I'll be your mother

[Verse 2]
The pain, it makes me so impulsive
I hate I can't control what I do
Even though I know the reason, I still cry out for you
So many highs, it's balanced
I just gotta accept my truth
I will be your six letter word, my four letter word is you

[Pre-Chorus]
B-A-B-Y
This just changed my life
Can't believe I, can't believe I, can't believe I don't have time
B-A-B-Y
I talk to you at night
Won't believe I, won't believe I, won't believe I won't have time

[Chorus]
'Cause someone's right for me, waiting
To feel all my love and make you with me
I'll never give up, even if it breaks me
Feels in my heart, we'll meet one another
You'll be my baby
Try to be patient
Real love will save me
God knows I'm waiting
To be your mother
You might also like[Bridge]
Promises, and loyalties
My truest dream, for you to look at me, look at me
And feel proud, love and eternity
When my time comes
And I find the one for you
We'll be forever happy

[Chorus]
'Cause someone's right for me, waiting
To feel all my love and make you with me
I'll never give up, even if it breaks me
Feels in my heart, we'll meet one another
You'll be my baby
Try to be patient
Real love will save me
God knows I'm waiting
To be a mother

[Outro]
To be a, to be a moth-mother
