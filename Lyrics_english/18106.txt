Madhouse Lyrics[Intro]
It's time for your medication, Mr. Brown
Muhahahahahahahahaha!

[Verse 1]
Oh, white coats to bind me, out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion, air filled with noise
Who says that my life's such a crime?

[Pre-Chorus]
Trapped in this nightmare, I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me, an empty gaze
I can't find my way outta this maze
And I don't care, fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt (Help me!)
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame
[Chorus]
It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Oh, am I insane?

[Verse 2]
My fears behind me, what can I do?
My dreams haunt my sleep at night, oh no
Won't learn their lesson, white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
Trapped in this nightmare, I wish I'd wake
And my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me, an empty gaze
I can't find my way outta this maze
'Cause I don't care, fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt (Help me!)
Can't take the blame
I don't feel the shame

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
I'm insane!

[Pre-Chorus]
Trapped in this nightmare, I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me, an empty gaze
Can't find my way outta this maze
'Cause I don't care, fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt (Help me!)
Can't take the blame
You don't feel the shame

[Chorus]
It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
I'm insane

[Outro]
Mad, madhouse (Mad)
Mad, mad, mad, madhouse3Embed
