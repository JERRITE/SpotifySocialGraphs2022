You are going to miss me (live) Lyrics [lyrics by "you're going to miss me (live)" ft. Viru they kumbed]

[Intro: Pablo Lescano, Johanna Rodríguez]
The kisses of my mouth were not enough
To stay with me forever
I don't get the love to be happy
I loved you crazy and you didn't realize

[Bridge: Pablo Lescano, Viru]
(ATR Dog, Cumbia, Cageteala Piola, Cat)
(Free ladies, Viru-Viru Kumbon, Uipi)
[Verse 1: Pablo Lescano, Johanna Rodríguez]
The kisses of my mouth were not enough
To stay with me forever
I don't get the love to be happy
I loved you crazy and you didn't realize

[Verse 2: Pablo Lescano, Johanna Rodríguez; Viru]
Your words were false
Your hands lied to me when you stroked me
That it served to beg you to stay
My mistake was to give you everything when nothing is worth (Cantalo) (and how does it say!?)

[Chorus: Pablo Lescano, Johanna Rodríguez]
You're going to miss me, I bet you what you want you to look for me
And you're going to cry because you never knew how to value me
You're going to remember all our mischief, but it will be too late (and how does it say!?)

You're going to surprise me because a love as not easy is forgotten
And nobody will know how to do all the things that I did to you
But it was a mistake to give my heart to whom I did not deserve it
(And the palms up!)

[Musical interlude: Viru]
Up!

[Chorus: Johanna Rodríguez]
You're going to miss me, I bet you what you want you to look for me
And you're going to cry because you never knew how to value me
You're going to remember all our mischief, but it will be too late
You might also like you are going to miss because a love as not easy is forgotten
And nobody will know how to do all the things that I did to you
But it was a mistake to give my heart to whom I did not deserve it
But it was a mistake to deliver my heart
Who did not deserve it

[Outro: Pablo Lescano, Johanna Rodríguez]
Hands in the air, applause for Johanna
Thank you very much, thank you
