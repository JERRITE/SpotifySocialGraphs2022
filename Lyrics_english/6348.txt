Elegant Strangers LyricsMemories are pressed into my eyes
That burn like Roman candles in the sky
Fading into red and pink and gold
Lingering in secrets never told

There's nothing left to save
I just want to hear the shapes
Drowning in the night
Exploding into firelight

I can't go a day
'Cause all my thoughts are just your slaves
So I don't wanna hear them anymore
Face down for another one
We're elegant strangers
Dressed up for the morning sun
Mirrors and razors

Don't say you're leaving
We've only just begun
Checked out and already gone
Elegant strangers

Anyone's a friend who holds a light
We'll head towards the sunset of our my minds
Chasing after favours, there's no end if we start
Another revelation after dark

I can't go a day
'Cause all my thoughts are just your slaves
So I don't wanna hear them anymore

Face down for another one
We're elegant strangers
Dressed up for the morning sun
Mirrors and razors
Don't say you're leaving
We've only just begun
Checked out and already gone
Elegant strangers

We're elegant strangers
Dressed up for the morning sun
Mirrors and razors
Don't say you're leaving
We've only just begun
Checked out and already gone
