Turn Back the Clock LyricsAnother day is ended
And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better
Lying here in silence
Picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
How I realise they were the best years of my life

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

You might say it's just
A case of giving up
No
But without these memories where is the love
(So) Where is the love?

If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

Why can't I turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days
Oh no no
I remember when
Life was so good
I'd go back if I could

Don't let the memories slip away
I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip awayEmbed
