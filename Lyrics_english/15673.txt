Mother Earth (hey) Lyricsletra "Mother Earth (hey)"
[Intro]
You must provide love for later
Ask
You have to forgive to continue
Remember that we have only one
Ida trip
And you have to always thank the
Life
To the life
To the life
To the life
To the life
[Chorus]
Hears
Open your eyes
Look up
Enjoy the good things you have
Life
Open your eyes
Look up
Enjoy the good things you have
Life

[Verse 1]
When you are lost and don't know
Where are you going
Remember where you come from and what
You will feel good
Whenever it rains is Campa
They are mom advice
That with the blessing of your
Ancestors you will arrive

[Pre-car]
Drum, drum, drum, what calls
To drum
Drum, drum, drum of my
Mother Earth
Drum, drum, drum, what calls
To drum
Drum, drum, drum of my
Mother Earth

[Verse 2]
Falling is allowed and getting up is
Obliged
Don't throw stones at the neighbor if
Crystal is your roof
Dog that bark does not scare yourself
It will never bite you
That with the blessing of your
Ancestors you will arrive

[Pre-car]
Drum, drum, drum, what calls
To drum
Drum, drum, drum of my
Mother Earth
Drum, drum, drum, what calls
To drum
Drum, drum, drum of my
Mother Earth
[Chorus]
Hears
Open your eyes
Look up

Open your eyes
Look up
Enjoy the good things you have
