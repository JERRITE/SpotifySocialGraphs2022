Translation Turkçeairbnb Lyrics [Songtext to "Airbnb" ft. Ufo361]

[Intro]
(Hehehe, Young Lime Made the Juice)

[Hook: T-Low]
I never go to an Airbnb without ten bottles lean
Designer my shirt and she fell in love
Millions of streams make life a dream
Keep up, sometimes rich with my team
Bitch, the 'a hunter and no hennessy
Joint almost a meter, I'll go 'and I fly'
Kipp 'in the Sprite Promеthazine
Devil im Mind and Devil, he wins
[Part 1: T-Low]
Say your Broke Boys from friends Ma '
I buy your family if I want
Look, she's doing it and looks like this
As if she didn't know who I am
I'm still the same, just richer and such
But Chill 'still with the same from Bros as before
I wanted it all like that, yes
Now songs go gold from me, yes
Mom, dad, both proud, yes, yes
More than just success, yes

[Hook: T-Low & Ufo361]
I never go to an Airbnb without ten bottles lean
Designer my shirt and she fell in love
Millions of streams make life a dream
Keep up, sometimes rich with my team
Bitch, the 'a hunter and no hennessy (yes, yes)
Joint almost a meter, I pull and I fly '
Kipp 'in the Sprite Promethazine (you know)
Devil im Mind and the Devil, he wins (yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)

[Part 2: UFO361]
Yes, I now live in Paris, Ricky Owens on Me (yes, you know)
My villa looks like an Airbnb (yes)
I am the emperor, my girl is the queen (wouh)
So many women, but I just want her (wouh)
Swim in lean like in the ball bath
They look at me like an alien - Predator (EY)
Goyard case full of cash like managers (yes)
Yes, I'm stacking the racks now, stack it up
Don't get out of the trap (trap)
Fuck your fiat, I pull in the tank, scratch
She wants sex, yes, I know what she thinks (yes, yes)
She takes a sip of mei'm drank
Yes, I'm on it, my feelings are Dead (Dead, Dead, yes)
Yes, she gives head (uh, yes) while I steer
You Might So Like [Hook: T-Low & Ufo361]
I never go to an Airbnb without ten bottles lean (yes)
Designer my shirt and she fell in love (fell in love, yes)
Millions of streams make life a dream
Keep up, sometimes rich with my team (Stay High)
Bitch, the 'a hunter and no hennessy
Joint almost a meter, I pull and I fly '
Kipp 'in the Sprite Promethazine
Devil im Mind and Devil, he wins

[Bridge: T-Low]
Woah, it's about Mud with me
I have codeine with me, I can't lose that
Ey, woah, he just wanted to try it out, only feel intoxication once
Now he can't get away anymore
He's on it now like us, yes, yes
He's on it now like us, he now looks like us
He's out now like us, yes, yes, yes
He is going on like us now, yes

[Hook: T-Low]
I never go to an Airbnb without ten bottles lean
Designer my shirt and she fell in love
Millions of streams make life a dream
Keep up, sometimes rich with my team
Bitch, the 'a hunter and no hennessy
Joint almost a meter, I pull and I fly '
Kipp 'in the Sprite Promethazine
Devil in Mind and Devil, he wins3embed
