Now Is The Time (Ravenous) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Appetites reach all time highs
No ones seems to care who dies
Prey on every little thing in sight (in sight)
To kill or be killed state of mind
Anything to stay alive
Never ever show your terrified (terrified)
It's a common casualty
To trust in what you see
Saints and scholars
Don't even bother
The bullet in the blood
Came from those you love
Friendly fires
Death by a liar
[Pre-Chorus]
Dumb, deaf and blind
(Dumb, deaf and blind)
Fall back in line
(Fall back in line)

[Chorus]
Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies
Comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire
And bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

[Verse 2]
Focus now on how to gain
Loyalty from enemies
Waiting patiently for when to strike
The bullet in the blood
Came from those you trust
Friendly fires
Death by a liar
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Dumb, deaf and blind
(Dumb, deaf and blind)
Fall back in line
(Fall back in line)

[Chorus]
Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies
Comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire
And bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this time

[Breakdown]
These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards always get what they're after
These ravenous bastards
Them vultures swarm in circles like a storm
The carnivores rip into the core
For more and more and more
They rip into the core
[Chorus]
Now is the time
To open your eyes
You need it, you want it
You did it, you got it
So act like you own it this time
The coma of lies
Comfort your mind
Your feeding the fire
And bleeding desire
It's down to the wire this timeEmbed
