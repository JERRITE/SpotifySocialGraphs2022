Lifeâ€™s Greatest Fool Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some walk out winners of those who've lost
Can it be said at any price this is the cost?
Hard is perception, easier is blame
Is this the only life for everyone?
Is it the same?

[Verse 2]
Children laugh and run away
While others look into the darkness of the day
Some streets are easy while some are cruel
Could these be reasons why man is life's greatest fool?
[Chorus]
Do you believe when you're all alone
You held the key to your destiny gone?
Do you believe deep in your soul
That too much loneliness makes you grow old?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Words can be empty, though filled with sound
Stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound
Formed out of pleasure, chiseled by pain
Never the highest and not the last one to gain

[Chorus]
Do you believe when you're all alone
You held the key to your destiny gone?
Do you believe deep in your soul
That too much loneliness makes you grow old?

[Outro]
(Do you believe, do you believe, do you believe)
You held the key to your destiny gone?
(Do you believe, do you believe, do you believe)
You held the key to your destiny gone?
(Do you believe, do you believe, do you believe)
You held the key to your destiny gone?
(Do you believe, do you believe, do you believe)You might also likeEmbed
