How sad lyrics [verse 1: floor 21]
How sad when you told me
That you no longer wanted, that you would forget
I turned on a cigar and my life goes
I loved you so much and now I take so much
On drunk street like a vagabund
Without your company, what do I do with the wound? NA-NA-NA

[Chorus: Carin León & Floor 21]
How sad that you have not valued me
I gave you everything and now you cared for a fuck
Oh, how sad you left me lying
I gave you everything and now I cared for a fuck
[Verse 2: Carin León]
How sad, I feel since you left
I spend crazy and waved
So much drink brings me the cross cables
I walk an unstable
How sad I feel just to remember
But just one thing I tell you
This is the latest song song that I write to you
Health and God bless you
I no longer know why I spend my saliva
Your asshole is over, my life
Your blowjobs, I'm going up

[Bridge: Carin León]
How sad to get lost, how sad not see me
What eggs think and you wanting to eat me
How sad to get lost, how sad not see me
What a egg think and I wanting to eat you

[Choir: 21 & Carin León Floor]
Oh, how sad you have not valued me
I gave you everything and now I cared for a fuck
How sad you left me lying
I gave you everything and now you cared for a fuck

[Verse 3: Floor 21]
I keep smoking cigar, no matter how much I deal
I am a canteen, I am a neighborhood man, your masty heart that a hitman
You put me to pray the rosary, at seven to ride a horse
Do not come to look for me, if later you see me a millionaire

But what sadness, what disappointment, to my wounds you put a lemon
And it burns in my soul, having eaten all your words, they are saving bullets
Well, you didn't kill me, you're going to come back and have to drag, you're going to cry
You are going to beg me, you will pay sooner rather than later
But what sadness, what disappointment, in my wounds you put a lemon
And it burns in my soul, having swallowed all your words, they are saving bullets
Well, you didn't kill me, you're going to come back and have to drag, you're going to cry
You are going to beg me, you will pay sooner rather than later

[Chorus: Carin León & Floor 21]
How sad that you have not valued me (you have not valued me)
I gave you everything and now you cared for a fuck (you cared a fuck, you cared a fuck)
How sad you left me lying (you left me lying)
I gave you everything and now you cared for a fuck (you cared a fuck, you cared a fuck)

[Outro: Carin León & Floor 21]
Is Carin León (Carín León)
From Colombia to Mexico
21st floor (Over, go on)
And oh, ay! Embed
