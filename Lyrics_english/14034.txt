Jupiter Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse]
Wrote it down in the winter of 1610
Just a secret under lock and key until then
While collecting the stars, I connected the dots
I don't know who I am, but now I know who I'm not
I'm just a curious speck that got caught up in orbit, in orbit
Like a magnet it beckoned my metals toward it, toward it

[Chorus]
Make my messes matter
Make this chaos count
Let every little fracture
In me shatter out loud
Make my messes matter
Make this chaos count
Let every little fracture
In me shatter out loudYou might also like1Embed
