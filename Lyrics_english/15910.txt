One foot after another lyricsla road that leads to the sea
Shines with the full moon
Fireworks fly in my head
Summer has knocked on the door

Blood runs or o o o
Light in my veins
And there are new illusions in the air

They roll the waves loaded with sand
Under a shower of stars
I can feel the perfumed break bree
That touches me and removes sorrows
Fly the foam or or o
Palm trees move
And even the moon dances in the bonfires
Chorus-
One foot after another foot without running step by step
The pores of my skin
They wake up slowly
One foot after another I am
Trembling just like a niï¿½o
One foot after another I'm going
In case I get with you and yeah, I don't not no no no yeah!

Live for memory
Not worth it
More account is suffered
But no matter how much I try to throw you out of my head
Fool my heart is not left

Today is an or or or or
What I saw for the first time
With the madness of your brunette skin

Chorus-
One foot after another foot without running step by step
The pores of my skin wake up slowly
One foot after another I am
Trembling just like a niï¿½o
One foot after another I'm going
In case I get with you nooo, no no no no no No Yeah!
