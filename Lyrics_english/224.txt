Most Hated Lyrics[Intro]
Man, hahaha
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)
(Gangsta Grillz)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Hunnid on my wrist, thirty in that clip
I'ma push one button swear to God tap just gon' flip
Pink slips no leases, fuck it, I'm facetious
When this shit drop I ain't bout to be doin' no more features
I don't like them niggas anyway, I say fuck them niggas everyday
When you see me you don't see me, yeah, bitch nigga better look the other way
Call Of Duty, this is not a game, F&N knock you out the frame
SIG on me it'll do the same
Big dog in a Phantom hoggin' lanes
Fuck 'em all got on all the chains went legit still thinkin' cane
Niggas tryin' to count a nigga out last time you seen a nigga count
I don't like them niggas anyway, I say fuck them niggas evеryday
I'm the type of nigga make a phonе call, send them niggas in a Chevrolet
[Chorus: Jeezy & Lil Durk]
I'm so faded, bottles gold plated
Tonight we celebrated, I'm most hated
I'm so faded (The Voice), bottles gold plated
Tonight we celebrated, I'm most hated

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Me I'm The Voice and I'm hated the most
Been would've slid, we in war with a ghost
Lie, and the police department denied, that nigga was scared to go do a show
We lap in the winter, it's easy to think you not lackin' in snow
Broddie be cappin', you know he a napkin, you know he gon' brrr, wipin' his nose
Yeah, I be hearin' the rumors, like nigga be havin' me scared, that shit be havin' me dead
Niggas be askin' "What happened to Virgil?" like, nigga, what happened to two of your mans
Bro beat a body, he look me right in my eyes and he told me he'll do it again
Go on a hit and you miss, shit, I bet you ain't going again
I'm from the Raq and we not preaching 'bout killings, we tappin' him right on the back
I'm from the Raq, bro, this ain't wifey, if you pickin' me up she gon' get in the back
You listen to preachers and teachers, you listen to all of you bitches, I listen to Yak
They want that blow, hey bro, throw 'em Sno, the city wanna hear that crack, ayy

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm so faded, bottles gold plated
Tonight we celebrated, I'm most hated
I'm so faded, bottles gold plated
Tonight we celebrated, I'm most hated
