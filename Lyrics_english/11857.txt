But I can't love you lyricsque taste dawn
In your arms my love
How rich is kissing you
As soon the sun rises
What a pleasure to go to sleep
With the moon on the balcony
Knowing that for me
It beats your heart
How rich or eyes look at you, huh ...
How rich in them lost me. Oh oh...
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich it is done to me
Not see you
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich in a hug
Every day remind you
What else can't I love you
Eh, huh, huhhh ...
What else can't I love you
Eh, huh, huhhh ...
What else can't I love you
It feels good
Give life for whom
They deserve it
Because there is no one who
I love you like me
My doll for good
Wool feels
One hundred tickets
He looks at you slow
That's his baiben
I promise to love
Until I have a hundred
Years old and
Much more too
He looks at you slow
That is your sway
I promise to love
Until I have a hundred
Years old and
Much more too
Dance as a highness
And my queen here
In my head
Than your heart
Be the piece
That is missing in
My puzzle
Of follower of
Its smell, its beauty
I would want you
I love you
Synonym of greatness
That is my queen and
How rich he kisses me
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich it is done to me
Not see you
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich in a hug
Every day remind you
What else can't I love you
Eh, huh, huhhh ...
What else can't I love you
Eh, huh, huhhh ...
What else can't I love you
Watch well
That today I invite her
To an adventure for infinity
A little piece of you, a little kiss
Makes me come back
Crazy Loquito
And there is no doubt that my
Love for you is high
No expiration date
That is why it endures and hard
Indestructible
I feel invincible with you
You and me compatible souls
If I do not have you
I feel terrible
Sensitive, makes him
Impossible to be possible
You my engine, my fuel
And in passion
It is always available
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich it is done to me
Not see you
How delicious to have you
How rich kiss you
How rich in a hug
Every day remind you
What else can't I love you
And even more, and even more
I can love You
What else can't I love you
And even more, and even more
I can love You
