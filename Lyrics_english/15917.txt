I like the two lyrics (Mario Ablanedo)
If it were the typical story
What we see in the triangles
As much as there would be chestica
It would be a flashing love
But it's all so complicated
That if I don't save me a miracle
I will end up biting the mud
Me too
We danced, it was Saturday
With Kisses of Canival Love
And those eyes of antilope
Radiating barbarous messages
They put me the same as a motorcycle
I said I was going to look for something in the bag
And I walked
I like both
I hate going through coward
And there is no one to save me today
I like both
A constant shock
Stir my blood, Lord
I like both
And with both I ...
The one, the ludic didy
THE OTHER VOLCANIC FIRE
The two sign with their signed
Of dark circles and changes in habit
If the view does not see what happens
Badly finds out the heart
I like both
I hate going through coward
And there is no one to save me today
I like both
A constant shock
I am in a pressure pot
It must be that the plans I make
I must edit the devil
Because I keep playing daily and without error
I like both
I hate going through coward
Who wants me to change? I do not!
I like both
And although it costs me a lot
I enjoy the situation
I like both...
I like both
A constant shock
I boil my blood, so IUOU MIGHT ALSO Likeembed
