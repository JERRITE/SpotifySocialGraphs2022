Hey how Lyricsletra goes from "hey how it goes"
Hey, how is it going
My pace
Well to enjoy
Mulatto

Hey, how is it going
My pace
Well to enjoy
Mulatto
And don't stop it, don't stop dancing
That now the heat begins without equal
And don't stop it, don't stop dancing
Because this rhythm will hesitate you more

Hears
My rhythm that how
Preferred mulatto

Hears
My rhythm that how
Preferred mulatto

Hey, how is it going
My pace
Well to enjoy
Mulatto

Hey, how is it going
My pace
Well to enjoy
Mulatto

She knows what is the feeling
That is why I am moving this tremendous guaguancó
I like that brunette how the hip moves
To the compas of this rhythm that is pure candle
You might also like he hears how
I know it's going to like you
Hey, how is it going
I know you're going to ask for more

Come a mulatto that we are going by plane
On a flight without a scale to the hesitation

She knows that this good
When the street goes out (my rhythm)
Always pending detail
With his tomb ’of Sirena, Morena (my rhythm)
And his serene gaze

With mine you find (my rhythm)
And without words he tells me singing
To forget my problems (my rhythm)

And don't stop it, don't stop dancing
That now the heat begins without equal
And don't stop it, don't stop dancing
Because this rhythm will hesitate you more

Hears
My rhythm that how
Preferred mulatto
Hears
My rhythm that how
Preferred mulatto

My rhythmBed
