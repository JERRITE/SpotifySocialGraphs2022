Move it Lyrics ["Move it" letter]]

[Intro: Atomic another way, lirico at home]
Atomic another way
Lyric in the house (woop, woop)
Lyric in the house
Dude

[Choir: Lirico in the house]
This is a movie pod
Pa 'that mamis move their sheet
I like the lassie (lassie)
But be breed (wey!)
This is a movie pod
Pa 'that mamis move their sheet
I like the lassie (lassie)
But be race

[Post-car: lirico in the house]
Move it, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Move it, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1: atomic another way, lirico in the house]
And tell what you want
Just shoot me the light
And if you feel a downpour
Do not stop that is good

Do not make me a pachatic of saladita cookie
That there are times that I am so genius that Aladín requests me
Today I have an appointment with rocker and baldita
And if you don't go 'we see' you orita
Fire!

Ass in the air, teta in the air, all in the air
I don't know what happens to him
I'm with more than ten women
And my component today is lyrical in the house
Ass in the air, teta in the air, all in the air
I don't know what happens to him
I'm with more than ten women
And my component today is lyrical in the house

[Verse 2: Lyric in the house, Lirico at the & Atomic House another Way]
(Lyric in the house, woop, woop)
Dasacata'o in a motorcito Ando with a lassie
Atomic put the hood for the paparazzi
That I have a pool full of easy women
The one that became gross, you know
From the choir there is one that likes a lot
That when she moves it I get weak
I haven't seen that picket that has a lot
I want him to raise it, to raise it, but that he uploads it a lot
Give him, give him, give him
Let's get crazy, crazy
I like how you move it mommy
That waist makes me crazy
Give him, give him, give him
Let's get crazy, crazy
I like how you move it mommy
That waist makes me crazy

Move it, Ah, move it, ah
