Straight Lines Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breathing from a hole in my lung
I had no one but faces in front of me
Racing through the void in my head
To find traces of a good luck academy
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Sparks ignite and trade them for thought
About no one and nothing in particular
Washed the sickened socket and drove
Resent nothing, there's goodwill inside of me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Wake me up, lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately, I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line

[Verse 3]
Something I will never forget
I felt desperate and stuck to the marrow
Invisible to everyone else
I'm a sex change and a damsel with no heroine
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Wake me up, lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately, I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line
You might also like[Bridge]
I don't need no time to say
There's no changing yesterday
If we keep talking and
I keep walking in straight lines

[Chorus]
Wake me up, lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately, I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line5Embed
