Beggars & Hangers-On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I know you couldn't love me
'Cause you're promised to a wealthy man
Take a look, what are you seein'?
Is that a noose or a wedding band?
Should I go to see a healer?
Nervous twitchin' in my hands
Nervous twitchin' in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
God, help me rid this feelin'
'Cause I'm fallin' all to pieces
And I can't get out of bed
[Chorus]
Beggars and hangers-on
Try to take you from me
Someone with a Bible in his pocket
Cloudin' everything you see
Beggars and hangers-on
They chip it away
Bury your soul in the river
'Cause the end is here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
God help me rid this feelin'
Cause I'm fallin' all to pieces
And I can't get out of bed

[Verse 2]
I was wrong, I don't need you
It seems reckless and unfair
Better days are far behind me
Guess that's another cross I'll have to bear

[Bridge]
I know that there's a time and a reason
To take that ghost and lock it up inside
And maybe I am down, but I'm not beaten
Like anything, we were born to die
You might also like[Chorus]
Beggars and hangers-on
Try to take you from me
Someone with a Bible in his pocket
Cloudin' everything you see
Beggars and hangers-on
They chip it away
Bury your soul in the river
'Cause the end is here to stay

Beggars and hangers-on
Beggars and hangers-on
