RUNTZ Lyrics[Intro: Curly Savv]
Yoz, what you tellin' me?
Hahaha, ha
You already know what it is, man
Uh, shawty a thottie, she all on my body 'cause [?]
Uh, uh, ha, ha

[Chorus: Curly Savv]
Smokin' on opps, that's Runtz, I'm leanin'
Pour four , turn to demon, opp in the spot
Bro, did you seen him, uh, uh
Can't wait till I meet him, uh, uh, can't wait till I
Smokin' on opps, that's Runtz, I'm leanin'
Pour four, turn to demon, opp in the spot
Bro, did you seen him, uh, uh
Can't wait till I meet him, uh, uh, can't wait till I
[Verse 1: Curly Savv]
I'm coolin', I'm leanin'
Soon as I seen him, I'm preein'
Opp in the spot, just beat him
How could I lack if I keep it?
Clutchin' and bustin', I'm fiendin'
New opp in the air, you could be him
When I'm off of the lean, I'm a demon
R.I.P. Fredo, I can't be OD'in'
Smokin' on opps, Cookies
Got me right back on my bully
They already know what's goody
It's crazy, you know how the hood be
Smokin' on opp, that's Runtz
Treesh get passed like blunts
Boy, we slide up once
It wasn't even like it was
Turn up a notch, smokin' on opps
They call me Glocky 'cause I keep a Glock
Don't get me lit 'cause I won't be a thot
But you won't be the first to come take a shot

[Chorus: Curly Savv & Fivio Foreign]
Smokin' on opps, that's Runtz (Runtz), I'm leanin'
Pour four (Bitch), turn to demon, up in the spot (Ayy, ayy)
Bro, did you seen him, uh, uh (Lil' bitch)
Can't wait till I meet him, uh, uh (Lil' bitch), can't wait till I (Ayy)
Smokin' on opps, that's Runtz (That's runtz), I'm leanin' (I'm leanin')
Pour four, turn to demon, up in the spot
Bro, did you seen him, uh, uh (Uh)
Can't wait till I meet him, uh, uh, can't wait till I (Look, hold on)
