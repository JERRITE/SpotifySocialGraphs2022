Letter to Lady J Lyrics[Verse 1]
My dear old friend, it's you we need
There's blood in the gutters and fear in the street
How long we fight for a change that never comes
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in some ways it's the same, but tonight the crowd they came
Fists in the air, candles and vigils
Cracked dreams held together with curses and wishes

[Chorus]
But how long's it been since you been outside
How long's it been since you open your eyes
Cuz I've been to the line and it's all right there
And I cannot wait to get on from here
[Verse 2]
Arms bent back and black jack welt
Involuntary tears and the tears we felt
Does it always have to get worse before it gets better
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in some ways it's the same, but tonight the crowd they came
Fists in the air, candles and vigils
Cracked dreams held together with curses and wishes

[Chorus]
But how long's it been since you been outside
How long's it been since you open your eyes
Cuz I've been to the line and it's all right there
And I cannot wait to get on from here

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Oh, Virgil Caine where are you now
Did they bury the hatewhen they buried the south
You got to tell the spirits mystics of tomorrow
[Pre-Chorus]
That in some ways it's the same, but tonight the crowd they came
Fists in the air, candles and vigils
Cracked dreams held together with curses and wishes
You might also like[Chorus]
But how long's it been since you been outside
How long's it been since you open your eyes
I've been to the line and it's all right there
And I cannot wait to get on from hereEmbed
