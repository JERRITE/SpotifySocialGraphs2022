Lyrics school love [Lyrics for "Love Love" FT. Bastian the threat, Chuchu Retro, Gabo el Chamaquito, Boss Supreme Lirycs, Uzbell, Andresito another Court & El Bai]

[Verse 1: Bastian]
Tell me what would happen
If the moon would come down that day
Of the recess ere 'only mine, mine
You ere 'my baby I fulfill your' fantasy '
You don't know what I would do
I rob you a kiss and I make you mine, mine
The two together 'that this afternoon is cold
Come wrap yourself in this melody, Lady
I get up thinking about you
In the 'night' I can't sleep
I find it hard to learn and write
You cannot pretend your love
My mother repeated to study all day
That my goal 'would fulfill
But I wasn't able to get you out of my mind
I became a insane, in class' I no longer see you
Listen that you are no longer forever
But for you I live
You ere 'my motive
Much wins' I have to walk with you
And travel the world for this resounding love
You and I, My Love Forever, in my life and period
[Verse 2: luxian]
Wrap yourself with me now
Let the Moon witness
How you can be able to be your husband
You know it
Is that Baby you have me 'serious
And to forget that pure that I take syrup, with alcohol
Fine and tramadol
Thinking about the 'night' I had and saw the sun rise (OH)
Now I think of you, I'm going like an incense
Ashes
And everything makes me immense
And it is privilege
Have you in the same room and school
My heart you have paraplegia
I would like it to be 'mine, that was mine, baby

[Verse 3: the BAI]
Wait for me that I want to see you
Outside and your school
Pass by to pick you up
Calm your taita will not find out
If you do the Cimarra to have you
But every weeks that the bell sounds
I wait for you in the patio
Salta the window
Pa 'give you a kiss and take off the' wins'
Hidden 'of his Mai
Ma 'is that she calls me
Minor love is the purest love
I will love you forever, baby, swear you
My teacher told me that I had no future
And look at me now that I walk with the hard
You Might Also Like [verse 4: Andresito]
Tell me what would happen
If one day I would steal you
Tell your aunt not to come from intrometry '
If at the end of the day, day
You come with me to hide '
Salta claimant
I'm with pure people via '
Tell your pololo
That I don't go with Dam '
And whatever happens
I eat 'together' in the classroom
The director to the hours spend challenging
Why do I write the song 'instead of studying

[Verse 5: gabo]
Tell me what would happen if the moon would lower you?
If my magic would give you
If at school I would eat you, what would you do? (Gabo el Chamaquito)
My life, let me fulfill your fantasy '(Fantasy)
At night, afternoon and day (day)
Chulería, who would say, that I would fall in love
Cupid came and told me (what?)
A secret to the ear
That would no longer be your friend, I want to be your bandit
With exclusive flow
Knows' what I tell you
Your vitamin, your sixth sense
I am your chamaquito, you need me and I need you
Let me accompany you and give you a kiss
School love, love of friends
[Verse 6: Chuchu Retro]
School love, minor love
Everyone knows that you and 'my heart
Your 'father' doesn't love you with me
They say that I am a vague and my future is to be a thief
But it's not like that
For you I die, oh-oh
You Ere 'Mi Baby
With you I want everything, oh-oh
I fulfill your 'fantasies
From the day I made you mine (oh- oh)
Babsita I don't get you out of my mind
Everyone knew that at school you were my favorite
(Boss supreme lyrics)

[Verse 7: boss]
Always together at the same point
You and me against everyone
You are mine since I was a child and now that we are adults
We pass adversity and all insults
Against all odds
Although it was difficult
On the way they passed to the scares
You know I love it, I know you like

[Verse 8: uzbell]
The teachers told you
Don't get together with him
That you have a future and I do not spend level, ah
I will be hit '
But tell me
What is the importance of a paper dog
I bought a chocolate in the quiosquito
They didn't let you go to see this 'cursed dog'
But at calm, at recess I mischief
And if you play to enter it is late and stay another little while
They have pure bad
Because the other time they saw us in the room
Tús kisito 'do not match it
They don't want us together
And I can't forget that pretty schoolgirl, Yeh
