So Damn Into You Lyrics[VERSE 1]
Why don’t you shut the door
Like promises from God to feed the poor
Or a promise to pretend I won’t give in
But we’re both a little drunk now

Can I have you forever?
Every single night

[Chorus]
It started with a bang
Don’t know how you got me so messed up
But baby I won’t ever get enough, oh
'Cause I’m so damn into you
I’m so damn into you
[VERSE 2]
I want to see you lay
Naked like my thoughts when you dive in
You’re thunder filled with sexual tragedy
The weatherman says, almost certain
Grab a raincoat

Felt my mind break into pieces
I was fading into dust
Then you grabbed me with your madness
And you woke me up


[Chorus]
It started with a bang
Don’t know how you got me so messed up
But baby I won’t ever get enough, no
'Cause I’m so damn into you
I’m so damn into you


[Chorus]
It started with a bang
Don’t know how you got me so messed up
But baby, I won’t ever get enough, oh
'Cause I’m so damn into you
I’m so damn into youYou might also like2Embed
