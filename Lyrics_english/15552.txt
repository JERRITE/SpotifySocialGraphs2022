Everyone looks at me Lyrics [letter from "everyone looks at me"]

[Verse 1]
You made me feel that it wasn't worth
And my tears fell at your feet
I looked at me in the mirror and I didn't find me
I was just what you wanted to see

[Verse 2]
And I released my hair, I dressed as a queen
I put on heels, I painted and it was beautiful
And I walked to the door, I heard you shout at me
But your chains can no longer stop
[Pre-car]
And I looked at the night and it was no longer dark
It was sequins

[Chorus]
And everyone looks at me, they look at me, they look at me
Because I know I'm fine, because everyone admires me
And everyone looks at me, they look at me, they look at me
Because I do what few will dare
And everyone looks at me, they look at me, they look at me
Some with envy, but in the end
But in the end, but in the end, everyone will love me

[Verse 1]
You made me feel that it wasn't worth
And my tears fell at your feet
I looked at me in the mirror and I didn't find me
I was just what you wanted to see

[Verse 2]
And I released my hair, I dressed as a queen
I put on heels, I painted and it was beautiful
And I walked to the door, I heard you shout at me
But your chains can no longer stop

[Pre-car]
And I looked at the night and it was no longer dark
It was sequins

Because I do what few will dare
And everyone looks at me, they look at me, they look at me
Some with envy, but in the end
But in the end, but in the end, everyone will love me

[Outro]
And I released my hair, I dressed as a queen
I put on heels, I painted and it was beautiful
And I walked to the door, I heard you shout at me
But your chains can no longer stop

And I looked at the night and it was no longer dark
It was sequins3embed
