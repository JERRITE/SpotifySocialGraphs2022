Own Thang Lyrics[Intro]
You know how they like to stereotype us, man

[Chorus]
Shades on, tattoos
Lookin like I’m bad news
All black as usu'
Baby we don’t have rules
Gold teeth, gold chain
Like I’m in the dope game
So heat, so flame
Bitch I do my own thang
(Bitch I do my own thang)
[Verse 1]
Mobbed out, lookin' like a G
See me comin', make you wanna cross the street
Crooks lookin' odd by the police
Throw peace, but he prolly go beast, gold teeth
All red, I'm yelling "Go Chiefs"
Cross that, all black, no priest
I can tell you ain't had no ass like cold seats
Uptight, so sleek, no sheep
For all this ink that I got in my skin, I see you hatin'
Tryin' to read it to see if it's gang related
Must be linked in, questionin' me "Where Mary J at?"
Oh you need it? I probably can navigate it
That's beside the point, I'm with the team, nigga we made it
Pop the bottle, they wanna know where we play at
Now they down to join, like what I see and hate to say it
Is you with it and shit or you need a payment?
Got my

[Chorus]
Shades on, tattoos
Lookin like I’m bad news
All black as usu'
Baby we don’t have rules
Gold teeth, gold chain
Like I’m in the dope game
So heat, so flame
Bitch I do my own thang
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Bitch I do my own thang

Mobbed out, fifty peeps deep
From 25th and 56th Street
Now with J's on, bitches get deep
Tell homie don't bring a chick he can't keep
Got my shades on in the town low-key
Fuckin' dope, you fuck around and OD
Oh your main gone? Don't look around and blame me
I be coolin' and DTF, OPP
Offend you or something? You hatin' as if I got a be
The image assumption you made, I take a label, you see
Woah now, slow down, Joe Brown, Judge Judy
Take your top off if you not a cop off duty
I-I-I'm a wanted man, I'm a wanted man
I am what I am, I do what I can
Guessin' I'm a boss by the way I stand
Want a pic and a boss? I'ma get a thang

[Chorus]
Shades on, tattoos
Lookin like I’m bad news
All black as usu'
Baby we don’t have rules
Gold teeth, gold chain
Like I’m in the dope game
So heat, so flame
Bitch I do my own thang
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Shades on, tattoos
Lookin like I’m bad news
All black as usu'
Baby we don’t have rules
Gold teeth, gold chain
Like I’m in the dope game
So heat, so flame
Bitch I do my own thang
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Bitch I do my own thang (Bitch, bitch)
Bitch I do my own thang1Embed
