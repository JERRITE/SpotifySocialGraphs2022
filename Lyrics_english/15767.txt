[Intro: cold metrics]
UH, double portion
Cold metrics and mañas

[Verse 1: cold metrics]
I am looking to go out with everything like Mark Renton
Mom showed me the way and I didn't take the right
I bring the rage that has given me time
The frost metrics, the mind in a concert (WA)
I no longer complicate, it's true, I just let go
Do you want to fame? Kill the one who sings with you and a matter resolved
I get smoke, my dependence is increasing (What? What?)
I live in a sway screaming Mayday
I disappear is Mary Jane Call me David Blaine
I move away from the rest to avoid traumas and feel good (what? What?)
The fourth is a sauna of the forbidden
I have the anxiety of the days that I have not lived
What is not due to me is discussed
Rapeo with the property of the one who has felt it
[Chorus: Mañas Ru-Fino & Frías Metricas]
Because weed never dies, no
No one knows what broke
Weed never dies
Good grass here turns
My bold don't expect me
Weed never dies, ah
No one knows what he wants, what
Weed never dies
Good grass here turns
My bold do not wait for me

[Verse 2: Ru-Fino Maña]
That envy only leaves tired
I can cross the easy line, that's why I slow
I am the fruit of a gross father and sacrifice of Estela
I have a star duo and I spent the night in candle
Without seeing it, even if it accelerates me it is not out there
And I delegate out there, delight there, delight
Play Pai Try my FAI
Rain with snow, I go with my rap as far as I took
SHH, thanks Jeremy
I have people who support me outside
And enemies in my country, what do they want from me?
Leave me like that, there is no return on the way
I already chosen, time flies
Life goes through my eyes, I can't understand it
People want when they are underground
Everyone throws the first stone, the bridges break
And I don't die because ...

Weed never dies, no
No one knows what broke
Weed never dies
Good grass here turns
My bold don't expect me
Weed never dies, ah
No one knows what he wants, what
Weed never dies
Good grass here turns
My bold don't wait for me, Ahembed
