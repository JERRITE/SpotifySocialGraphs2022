Not a single word lyrics [verse 1]
She is screaming and makes her know
Ey, heart, listen to your head
But where are you going? Are you listening to me?
What about your pride? What had we stayed?

[Verse 2]
The night begins and with her my path
I look for you alone with my best dress
But where are you? What has happened?
What is left after so many years?
[Pre-car]
I look at those eyes that one day looked at me
I look for your mouth, your hands, your hugs
But you don't feel anything and disguise yourself as cordiality

[Chorus]
Not a single word
Neither gestures, nor passionate looks
No trace of the kisses that you gave me before
Until dawn, huh, eh, eh (-cer, eh, eh, h)
Not one of the smiles
For which every night and every day
Sob these eyes in which you now see yourself

[Verse 3]
Like a toy that clashes against a wall
I go out to meet you and I get lost as soon as I am looking for
An opportunity, a miracle or a spell
Make me beautiful and you handsome with me

[Pre-car]
In front of the eyes that one day looked at me
I put my back and a few steps
And I sign another defeat while my mouth says: "Never again"

[Chorus]
Not a single word
Neither gestures, nor passionate looks
No trace of the kisses that you gave me before
Until dawn, huh, eh, eh (-cer, eh, eh, h)
Not one of the smiles
For which every night and every day
Sob these eyes in which you now see yourself

It can't be, it's not me
The heart weighs me so much
For not being ice when heaven asks me patience

[Chorus]
Not a single word
Neither gestures, nor passionate looks
No trace of the kisses that you gave me before
Until dawn, huh, eh, eh ('cer, eh, eh, eh)
Not one of the smiles, for which every night and every day
Sob these eyes in which you now see yourself

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
