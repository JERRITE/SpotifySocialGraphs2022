5K Freestyle Lyrics[Verse]
I flip that O then I pick it up
Body's hit floors, we don't pick'em up
I hit the dough, then I hit the clutch
Hop in the whip with the tool, then I fix'em up
Pockets like Nutty Professor, them bitches still can't get thick enough
He gon' grip steel ,it's gon' stick'em up
He gon' sit still when I lift it up
Nigga don't talk now just listen up
Diamonds they shining they look like a satellite
Strap on my shoulder like bagpipes
Kappa give everyone gowns like it's Grad Night
Metal on me like a crashlight
See the red beam like the batlight
Slide on your ass like a halfpipe
Trynna talk good, then it's gon' be a bad night
Armor on me like the Dark Knight
Shot with the shotty it look like a shark bite
I am the lord like I'm Farquad
You will get left, please don't stand to the far right
I catch an opp in my eyesight
Put him on ice then I'm telling 'em bye bye
I do not fuck with no drive-bys
Hop out, the bullets connecting like WiFi
I catch an opp on the radar
See the red dot then I whip out the AR
This ain't no game, I'm not Treyarch
Shoot up the store got my K in the Kmart
Up in the mall like I'm Paul Blart
When that bitch talking, it just sound like a dog bark
I'm in the cut like a bookmark
Pulling your card I ain't talkin bout Hallmark
Counting my cash at the top charts
Bitch, I save money, live better, like Walmart
He ain't in the field, but he talk hard
Test me, I'm knockin ya shit out the ballpark
He say he sippin on Wockhardt
I see the Tylenol bottles he bought tho
Do anything for the guapo
Bring my bro Heist out the pen like El ChapoYou might also like5Embed
