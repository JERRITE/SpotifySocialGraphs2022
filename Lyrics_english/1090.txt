Youâ€™re the Reason Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna make a scene
I don't wanna let you down
Try to do my own thing
And I'm starting to figure it out

[Pre-Chorus]
That it's alright
Keep it together wherever we go
And it's alright
Oh well, whatever, everybody needs to know
[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why

[Verse 2]
I don't even care when they say you're a little bit off
Look 'em in the eye
I say, "I could never get enough"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's alright
Keep it together wherever we go
And it's alright
Oh well, whatever, everybody needs to know

[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why

If it was raining you would yell at the sun
Pick up the pieces when the damage is done
You say, "It's just another day in the shade"
Look at what a mess we made

[Chorus]
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
You might be crazy
Have I told you lately that I love you?
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly
And it's crazy that someone could change me
Now no matter what it is I have to do, I'm not afraid to try
And you need to know that you're the reason why3Embed
