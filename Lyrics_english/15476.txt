Lyrics lovers [letter from "lovers"]

[Verse: Xavibo, Xavibo & Marc Segu√≠]
Tired of going against the countercurrent
In the background we are all sad
I never got to know you
Magritte, "The Lovers"
Condemned to be free
Or do you sell your time, or don't you palias your hunger
Here he doesn't want to escape
It is because he does not know that he lives in jail
What will be beyond wire?
Of these meat barriers
Behind the history of the rocks that love the foam that size the wear
If until the most beautiful one you can remember
Carries with it the intrinsic sadness of not being able to prolong
And today I am going to sing sad songs, ballads to counterreloj
That is not a goodbye kiss
Nor is this cough cold
And you don't have wings
Is that you take them wet, love
And you expect someone to dry you instead of dancing naked in the sun
To the sound of birds and your faith, ours left
With that they were your things
That you left me so much "because"
And now there are so many that you don't know
There are so many things that you know
Nor is it good to knowyou miGht Also likembed
