Allow me lyrics ["allow me" ft. Yandel]

[Pre-car: Yandel]
He asked me as if I didn't know anything (oh, oh, oh; nothing, nothing)
What was my name and trembled (oh, oh, oh)
And I said: "Yandel" (oh, oh, oh)
She said: "It can't be
For me it is a pleasure to meet you "(oh, oh, oh)
(It is a pleasure to meet you and I walk with the melody of the street, Tony Dize)
Hahaha
[Choir: Tony Dize & Yandel]
This is what we are given
And we go alone, let me
Feel the rhythm, follow him exciting me
I convince you, we kill time here, here, here (release!)
If we are given (oh, oh, oh)
And we go alone, let me (oh, oh, oh)
Feel the rhythm, follow him exciting me (she knows it; oh, oh, oh)
I convince you, we kill time here, here, here

[Verse 1: tony dize]

Revise yourself to take you intimate and

[Chorus: Yandel]
If we are given (oh, oh, oh)
And we go alone, let me (oh, oh, oh)
Feel the rhythm, follow him exciting me (oh, oh, oh)
I convince you, we kill time here, here, here (oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Yandel]
(This is a process but me)
I will convince you, I will take you to a place where you can not escape
To a corner where you have to dance
Touching your body I can't help it
He wants to challenge me, I just detected it
