TranslationSENGLIMANIZATIONKISS OF DEATH LYRICS [Mika Nakajima "Kiss of Death" Lyrics]

Control that comes near and collapses
Don't be afraid of me

The sky that a flying bird dreamed of
The color to intersect is different RED

I closed my ears in the sound of hitting the door
Are you hitting you? Or other?
WILL YOUR LIPS TASTE THE KISS OF DEATH?

Darling fate runs on blood vessels
The world that started moving ... love?
I want to melt more than anyone darling
Don't be afraid of me Kiss me now

I want to taste you ...
I can't feel that alone

Hugging each other is because it blocks the wound
My lips block that breath
WILL YOUR LIPS TASTE THE KISS OF DEATH?

Darling is to the tip of the finger
What is the feeling of melting? ... Hey?
Control that comes near and collapses
Don't be afraid of me Kiss me now, my love

Death is similar to when you die
It tasted to be sensation and you
DID YOUR LIPS TASTE THE KISS OF DEATH?

Darling fate runs on blood vessels
The world that started moving ... love?
I want to melt more than anyone darling
Don't be afraid of me
Taste you with you Kiss meo Might Also Like5embed
