You Will Find Me Lyrics[Intro: Sierra and *Alex*]
Mm, *oh*

[Verse 1: Sierra and **Both**]
Words are lost
Mouths are closed
Even through the silent pause
You take it all
Table talks
Getting through the car ride home
It could be a late night call
**You take it all**
Anchor to hold
[Chorus: Sierra, *Alex*, and **Both**]
You leave me room for my imperfections
When I'm a mess and you jump right in
If I drift in the wrong direction
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
**Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me**
*You will find me*
You will find me
*You will find me*
You will find me

[Verse 2: Alex and **Both**]
Faint applause, empty rooms
Even when the crowds are gone
You take it all
Lines are crossed
Even when my mind's consumed
I never mean to bruise your heart
But you take it all
**Anchor to hold**

[Chorus: Sierra, *Alex*, and **Both**]
**You leave me room for my imperfections**
When I'm a mess and you jump right **in
If I drift in the wrong direction**
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
**Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me**
You will find me
*You will find me*
You will find me
*You will find me*

Ah, ah

[Chorus: Sierra, *Alex*, and **Both**]
*You leave me room for my imperfections*
When I'm a mess and you jump right in
*And if I drift in the wrong direction*
You turn the tide and you calm the wind
**Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me
You will find me
Anytime, everytime I get lost
You will find me**
You will find me
*You will find me*
You will find me
*You will find me*
You will find meEmbed
