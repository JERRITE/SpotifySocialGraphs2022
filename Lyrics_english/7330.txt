Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny) Lyrics[Intro: A.R. Rahman]
Jai Ho! Jai Ho!

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger & A.R. Rahman]
I got shivers
When you touch away
I'll make you hot, get all you got
I'll make you wanna say
(Jai Ho!)
(Jai Ho!)
I got fever
Running like a fire
For you, I will go all the way
I'm gonna take you higher
(Jai Ho!)
I keep it steady
'Cause steady is how I feel it
(Jai Ho!)
This beat is heavy, so heavy
You gon' feel it
[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & A.R. Rahman]
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I breathe
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I still believe
(Jai Ho!)
You are my destiny (My destiny)
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!
(Jai Ho!)
No, there is nothing that can stop us
(Jai Ho!)
Nothing can ever come between us
(Jai Ho!)
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho!

[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & A.R. Rahman]
Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me
I want you now
I know you can save me, come and save me
I need you now
I am yours forever, yes, forever
I will follow
Anywhere in anyway
Never gonna let go
