All At Sea LyricsI know, I don't know you
But don't think I don't know you
I saw you going under
Saved one for me

Cause I'm all at sea, lad
Don't know if I'm coming or going
There's no thorn, no stalk, there's no poison talk
That belongs to me

I only wanna
Well, I just wanna
Oh, I don't want anything it means the world to me
Well, I'm all at sea
I don't know if I'm coming or going
There's no hope, there's no fear, no rent arrears
Leave it all to me

If you take it all away
You've got a pile of everything you never even wanted
That's just too bad
You never wanted it so bad

Now tell me, where can I go?
To hear the songs I need
I used to go to your room
Open up and bleed
Ah, tell me where can I go?
To hear the songs I need
You find me in your room
Open up and bleed

She sells seashells on the seashore
He sells e-shells on the dancefloor
And your mum sells rocks
From a telephone box

Don't know if I'm coming or goingYou might also likeEmbed
