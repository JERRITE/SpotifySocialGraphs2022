She Likes (Bittersweet Love) LyricsWhat's the point of being in love
What's the point of being with someone you can't have
I know exactly how this will end
But for some reason I can't help myself
No I just can't help myself

She likes she likes
She likes to fight and make up
She likes she likes
She likes to be alone
She likes she likes
The heartache of a break up
She likes she likes
To be my bittersweet love
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

All you do is let me down
You pick me up and drag me around like a rag doll
I sew myself together again
But for some reason I can't help myself
No I just can't help myself

She likes she likes
She likes to fight and make up
She likes she likes
She likes to be alone
She likes she likes
The hearache of a break up
She likes she likes
To be my bittersweet love

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

She told me it's not workin out
I said "Hey doll, quit freakin' out
We've been through this too many times
Can't you just make up your mind"

She likes she likes
She likes to fight and make up
She likes she likes
She likes to be alone
She likes she likes
The heartache of a break up
She likes she likes
To be my bittersweet love
