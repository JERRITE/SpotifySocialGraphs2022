Dead Embryonic Cells Lyrics[Verse 1]
Land of anger, I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow, everything so alone
Laboratory sickness infects humanity
No hope for cure, die by technology

[Verse 2]
A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face
[Verse 3]
War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

[Chorus]
We're born
With pain
No more
We're dead
Embryonic cells

[Bridge]
Corrosion inside, we feel
Condemned future, we see
Emptiness calls, we hear
Final premonition, the truth

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Land of anger, I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow, everything so alone
Laboratory sickness infects humanity
No hope for cure, die by technology

We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're deadEmbed
