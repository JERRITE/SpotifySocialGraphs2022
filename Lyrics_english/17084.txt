Bag Drop Lyrics[Intro: Lancey Foux]
Uh, uh-uh
Woo, uh-uh (Skrrt)
Yeah, uh-uh (Painkid got all the sauce)

[Chorus: Lancey Foux]
When that bog drop, uh-uh
In the Maybach with a red top, uh-uh
All of my clothes be deadstock, uh-uh
All of my jewellery wet lock, tuh-uh (Whew)
I just be playin' a fool
Princess cuts, I'm 'bout to jump in a pool (Yeah, yeah)
Take it off my neck, I'm 'bout to go to the moon (Woo)
I had to take another X pill
I hit the baddie at the Marina, I had to take another jetski (Chyeah)
[Verse 1: Lancey Foux]
(Whew, whew, whew)
Look like someone died when I walked in the room (Yeah)
A girl is a gun and I'm totin' the AR-15, wearin' some Loubs
I took that ting out the A and she flyin' to London to roll with her goons
Tsunami, I'm slidin', hmm, Ferrari, I'm ridin', hmm

[Verse 2: Strick]
G6, I'm in my groove, water off penthouse room (Yeah, yeah)
Saw that charge, had to go to the top, ain't got no time to snooze
Fuckin' off X, call it, I'm shinin', they gotta watch the moves (Slime)
Got the canon, it ain't no drivin', but I still got the blues
Dropped the Royce, tinted too
Got a bad bitch on Snap tryna send her pussy through
Spent a hundred blues on park, Gucci air too

[Chorus: Lancey Foux]
When that bog drop, uh-uh
In the Maybach with a red top, uh-uh
All of my clothes, we deadstop, uh-uh
All of my jewellery wet lock, tuh-uh (Phew)
Act as you playin' a fool
Princess cuts, I'm 'bout to jump in a pool (Yeah, yeah)
Take it off my neck, I'm 'bout to go to the moon (Woo)
I had to take another X pill
I hit the baddie at an arena, I had to take another jetski (Phew)You might also likeEmbed
