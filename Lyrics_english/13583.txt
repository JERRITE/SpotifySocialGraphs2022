Ride or Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I worry you ain't on my level
’Cause I'm ready to love you, I mean like forever
I don't wanna push it, but maybe it’s just time
To choose ride or die

[Pre-Chorus]
I would risk it all, I'm not afraid (Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy)
Are you with me? Would you do the same?
Tell me
[Chorus]
Are you with me, ride or die?
Are you ready to survive with me?
'Cause I wanna face this crazy life with you
Fuck and fight with you
On and on, until we're insane

[Verse 2]
So now I believe we're just meant for each other
The way that you touch me, I've never known better
I'm so sick of guessing, so take me or let go
Just choose, yes or no

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, by now you should understand (Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy)
Please be careful, my heart's in your hands
Tell me

[Chorus]
Are you with me, ride or die?
Are you ready to survive with me?
’Cause I wanna face this crazy life with you
Fuck and fight with you
On and on, until we’re insane

[Bridge]
'Cause I wanna face this crazy life with you
Fuck and fight with you
Stay all night with you
On and on with you
Can’t go wrong with you
I want it all with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Are you with me, ride or die?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
'Cause I wanna face this crazy life with you
Fuck and fight with you
On and on, until we're insane

[Outro]
Are you with me, ride or die?
On and on, until we're insane1Embed
