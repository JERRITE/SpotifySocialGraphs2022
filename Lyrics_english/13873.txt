Harley Quinn Lyrics [Verse 1]
Bellagio, top floor in suite
The view of the strip
Travel as if I were in trip
Fuck was there in this drink? I don't know
But what do I know
And my life at times looks like a movie
Attracted like midges
At times I'm lucid
And instead other times not
Sometimes instead not
But she loves me because she knows that after all I am crazy
If you still call him don't answer or kill him
We smoke until the Mojave desert is in the mouth
I haven't spoken from this hotel for four weeks now
Your mother I know I hate me, no it can't see me
Because before meeting me you were a good girl
Yes but I already know this
I already know this
[Bridge 1]
And I don't want to know anymore I don't give a damn about anyone
Everyone wants your good but nobody gives you his
Then karashò
So dear Sciò

[Pre-chorus]
And I saw you again inside a movie
You seemed to me Harley Quinn
We mixed vodka and gin
We watched Steve McQueen
Running on a jeep
I snatched the briefs away from you
And we saliva upwards
A little more than that

[Chorus]
I have a quinn in my bed
I have a quinn in my bed
We drink vodka and gin
I have a quinn in my bed

[Verse 2]
I saw that you're going crazy
But how do you blame
Ridam me all the breath
After you took it off
Let's love each other for boredom
Let's find out for fun
Life is a whore
And sometimes you pay later
Indeed stay go away, you know
You are like that melody I had in mind
Do not say a word
Well it depends
For her I was as a drug
Well it depends
And we intertwined the bodies like the scooby-doo
The hand inside a plate full of shaboo
I don't remember well, yes but uphill
La la la la la la, i don't remember it anymore

But if you meet me on the street then you don't need to say goodbye
I said the truth but by writing it on the walls
But look what cancellation, you don't need to help me
For those who live a little in a hurry, they only count the minutes

[Chorus]
I have a quinn in my bed
I have a quinn in my bed
We drink vodka and gin
I have a quinn in my bed

[Outro]
I saw that you're going crazy, but how to give yourself wrong
Ridam me all my breath after you took it off
Let's love each other for boredom
Let's love each other for boredom
