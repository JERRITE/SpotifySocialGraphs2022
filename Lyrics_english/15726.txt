If you leave Lyrics [letter from "If you leave"]

[Intro]
It doesn't matter when it calls me '
If it is night or early
Because for you I am not
I know that jealousy beats you
But we are nothing
So forget, my love

[Pre-stribe]
I no longer die for you, Yeah
I don't die for you, Yeah
There are many women 'who are improved' that vo '
I never want to see you more '
[Chorus]
And now tell me if you're leaving
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you
And now tell me if you're leaving
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you

[Verse 1]
When he sees me (see) he agrees that (that)
I do it very well (good, good)
He wants to come back
Wants to have what you can't have (no, no)
Cannot understand (no-oh)
You should not want to accept that this was already (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Bad woman, bad woman
Now it's time to lose now I'm not going to fall into your game
But you are vo 'the one that will fall to my foot'
Please come back, but it won't happen
Although you can't erase all those Rimmel brands
So alone, alone
You're going to stay now, -Hora
I'm going to get away from problems (Wuh)
I want to enjoy the whole night (Wuh)
I no longer want me to jo-o-on '
For the Meno 'by aho-ora
(And if I talk to me 'I want it to be just to tell me)

If you go
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you
And now tell me if you're leaving
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you

[Verse 2]
I valued you without knowing that (without knowing what)
When I was' with me another mouth you kissed
You forgot me
You failed me
And now the fault is the one that pe-pe-pe-peak everywhere '
A night of alcohol, madness and betrayal
Now they made you forget
Everything-what is you lamenting today
And you ask me forgiveness but I told you no, no, no, no
Baby, I told you no

[Pre-stribe]
I no longer die for you, Yeah
I don't die for you, Yeah
There is a lot
I never want to see you more '
[Chorus]
And now tell me if you're leaving
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you
And now tell me if you're leaving
I don't think to look for you, -ar
Is' crazy to have me (-Nerme)
And now I don't want to see you, see you
