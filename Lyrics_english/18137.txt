IDC Lyrics[Intro]
(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

[Chorus: D Savage & Trippie Redd]
I don't care what they say
We got racks up in the bank (Bitch, bitch)
In the studio and I'm smoking on dank (Bitch)
Sipping on drank, got me higher than a plane
Lil' broke boy, better stay in your lane
Bust down the Rollie, I don't like it plain
I came with the slatts, you know that we bang (Woo)
We killin' all rats, we don't play no games (Uh, uh, yeah)
[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Hm, I don't care about your bae
I don't care about your gang
I don't care what you claim (Ooh)
Fuck nigga talkin' shit, bullets fallin' like rain (Boom, boom, boom)
Diamonds 'round my neck, devilish up in that Wraith
With them demons, I’m with the gang and we schemin'
I do not like your demeanor, I'm clutchin' that heater
You know what I mean, man
I feel like I am Vegeta, I'm totin' that nina
Pop out on a demon
Holy water 'round my neck like I need Jesus

[Chorus: D Savage]
I don't care what they say
We got racks up in the bank (Bitch, bitch)
In the studio and I'm smoking on dank (Bitch)
Sipping on drank, got me higher than a plane
Lil' broke boy, better stay in your lane
Bust down the Rollie, I don't like it plain
I came with the slatts, you know that we bang
We killin' all rats, we don't play no games

[Verse 2: D Savage]
Ayy, wanna get high right now
I was at Rolling Loud, I was just rolling loud, ayy (Huh, huh)
Choppa gon' shoot 'em down
Me and Trip smokin' up the pound
Twenty racks on me right now
I'm in pain, it's a shame, oh
Hit her from the back
I got her screaming out my name (Alright, okay)
I got my shooters with me taking aim (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
Got a bad bitch and you know she love giving me brain (Give me brain, yeah)
You might also like[Chorus: D Savage]
I don't care what they say
We got racks up in the bank (Bitch, bitch)
In the studio, I'm smoking on dank (Bitch)
Sipping on drank, got me higher than a plane
Lil' broke boy, better stay in your lane
Bust down the Rollie, I don't like it plain
I came with the slatts, you know that we bang
We killin' all rats, we don't play no games
