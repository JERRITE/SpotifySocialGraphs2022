Went Deaf Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Damn, MyBaad)

[Chorus]
Dior ski mask, used to think 'bout robbin' for designer
She know I want her, she can tell how hard that I be tryin'
Quick to take a nigga spirit, he united with his partner
On vacation with this chopper, if I get caught, then they gon' lock me
I'm rockin' rough
Way too many hoes to choose, what's the move?
I gotta get up off this juice, I'm lean crazy
Apologize for my addiction, I know they envy
I gotta make sure I'm not slippin'
Spend a dub and make that shit right back tomorrow
Real-ass light to me, vampire, you spin before it's dark
I'm sittin' at the cemеtery, I cried out for help, but thеy went deaf
Confinement solitary, really, I'm playin' the cards I'm dealt
[Verse]
They can't get credit for my wealth, I done did it all myself
Bullet rounds and droppin' shells, too much ice like I'm on meth
These niggas ain't opps, these niggas just broke and bored with nothin' to do but die
Ask Ms. Wanda, I was in that jungle screamin', "1600 Block" (Yeah)
I was always told that it's the feds or grave, ayy
So I hit my cup, and I looked up and prayed, ayy
Went hard in the booth for them to go leak songs
Real street nigga, got beef that I don't speak on
Off-White, we Black, but we on
Focus on music 'cause I can't talk sacks through the phone
Took too many losses, I'm cashin' out on Rick Owens
Fred, I miss you, nigga, I wonder how things been goin' (Yeah)
Main bird, I do two hundred in that Trackhawk
Left that model bitch on read 'cause I'm that raw
Known to spin it with my dogs, then we flee
We forever be the cause when they bleed

[Chorus]
Dior ski mask, used to think 'bout robbin' for designer
She know I want her, she can tell how hard that I be tryin'
Quick to take a nigga spirit, he united with his partner
On vacation with this chopper, if I get caught, then they gon' lock me
I'm rockin' rough
Way too many hoes to choose, what's the move?
I gotta get up off this juice, I'm lean crazy
Apologize for my addiction, I know they envy
I gotta make sure I'm not slippin'
Spend a dub and make that shit right back tomorrow
Real-ass light to me, vampire, you spin before it's dark
I'm sittin' at the cemetery, I cried out for help, but they went deaf
Confinement solitary, really, I'm playin' the cards I'm dealtYou might also like2Embed
