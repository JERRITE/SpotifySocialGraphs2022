The occasion (remix) Lyrics [letter of "the occasion (remix)" ft. Archangel, from La Ghetto, Zion, Farruko, Daddy Yankee, J Balvin, Nicky Jam, Ozuna & Anuel AA]

[Pre-central: Anuel AA]
Mere, I love him, punch
We 'somo' what we have the fucking street on fire

[Intro: Nicky Jam, Archangel & J Balvin]
(Hear This Music; Leggo ')
If I'm calling you is that I want to go out
You do not know 'the desire I have for you
I want to do it as I feel like
Give him, I'm going for you
You like how I make you feel
I give you without having to ask
We lose ourselves for a while
Tell you the exact place, which I arrive and I kidnap
This is the remix
[Choir: Ozuna & Nicky Jam]
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want you to repeat 'your movement'
Baby, what if we stop the time
And do we brew the situation?
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want you to repeat 'your movement' (woh)
Baby, what if we stop the time
And we better have sex? (OH)

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
I like the pots that you put that buttock
Repeat the movement that the bi 'does not get off
In the Hilton he told me: "Don't talk bad, be different (shh)
So, do what Monica did to Bill Clinton (Oh!)
No one is holy here or minimum (no)
More I do mix a pill with the liquid (let's go)
When he starts dancing, he moves to 'that pa' Atr√° '
I become Hannibal, Carnivoro
What is there? Indicates (no), that the climate forecasts
That Hurricane D.Y. It will cause you a downpour in that CRI '
Put on dirty and don't stop now, give it, follow him and move it
(I don't comply with the year ', but he said: "This sponge cake, come, eat it")
OH-OH-OH, OH-OH
(I don't comply with the year ', but he said: "This sponge cake, come, eat it")

Austin (Auh!)
Ey, baby, my phone sounds (Yeah)
And I answer you since I want to hear your sorrows ("Hello?")
I want to know if you liked the first occasion (yes)
To do the second, I'm going to the third (auh)
I motivate me and she motivates me (yap)
She touches me and I play it, and that the occasion follows (Yes)
So continue (uh), sucking continue (uh)
Head pa 'down, hands down and the ass for above, wow

[Choir: Ozuna & Farruko]
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want you to repeat 'your movement'
Baby, what if we stop the time
And do we brew the situation?
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want your movement to be repeated '
Baby, what if we stop the time
And we eat you and me, oh, oh, oh, oh?

[Verse 3: ozuna]
(This is the remix; ozuna)
Vamo 'to take advantage' the occasion, that time passes and does not take
Do not take away the movement ', with me an abuser, huh (baby)
How he loves Mile ', dancing is the killer
If you are Patek Philippe, I am Richard Miller, eh
Tell me how you do it ', ask what you want' and you please
When the street goes out that skirt has them to 'fast in the hunter
They throw and not be seen, the new commanding
The Odyssey Movement, Free Anuel, EH
[Verse 4: Anuel AA]
Daughter 'and lucifer, inside you hide it
"Real G 4 Life" Tatuao 'in my skin (in my skin)
Smoking puree (uah), fucking with one hundred kilo 'at the hotel
I will eat it, this bug will possess you

[Verse 5: Farruko]
Farru '!
Vamo 'to give rewind to the cassette
Put me in four that I want to see you
I want with you, we fuck again
As we and I did that time
Mommy, you put me Bellaco, 'Toy that here I take it out
Take off your clothes, but don't take off your taco '
Because I like you more
You see that you are bad and you have evil
I waited for me easily
I would like to give you backwards

[Verse 6: J Balvin]
J Balvin, Man
This is the second, there is no fear, mommy (skrt)
Lui called me and said you were pa'l party (wouh, wouh)
In the first one you were shy, but I saw your ability (Yes)
Of nymphomaniac that I did not know (SKRT-SKRT-SKRT-SKRT)
Hot he put on and started telling me
That she does it do it
Stop that boom, boom
That is what is born to you
Number one in everything he does
What do you want street if you have class, Baby?
Tell me what to do, crazy dancing, throwing me (Dirty)
She is vitamin, she tells me:
"I want to do what you don't imagine"
She is a machine

[Chorus: Ozuna]
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want you to repeat 'your movement'
Baby, what if we stop the time
And do we brew the situation?
I want the occasion to be repeated
I want you to repeat 'your movement'
Baby, what if we stop the time
And we better have sex, oh-oh, oh-oh?

[Verse 7: from the ghetto]
(You know what time it is homie; geezy)
Baby, tell me, what are we going to do (to do)
I want to repeat it again (UH)
With me you looked, what you did to me
I still remember before coming, oh
First I start from above
I finish sucking that toto
Before that we start drinking
A little sprite with syrup
With two picky in the system
I finish giving you until 6:02
Disrupting that C-U-L-O
In room 5-1-2
With me she left for him to do to him
Above me he climbed and the desire took them off
Pa 'above, you down, me down, you above
You on the night (Yeah)

[Verse 8: zion]
Because I have the key that puts it serious
She climbs on the naked bed, dances me and wants me to record her
He rides in my ship, she does know
Wraps me by making positions, causing me to get around
She is a devil, very dirty speaks to me
Keep running all night, asking me for a table
She devours me, we lost until the notion of time
We kill each other again, I want the moment to be repeated

[Verse 9: Nicky Jam]
Baby, I don't know what you have
That I live thinking about your body
The tits, the face, the abdomen
And he has that ass made well perfect
Without a hat I don't go pa 'inside
You know 'that I will think about it
When he squeezes and tells me in the ear:
"Oh, Nicky, how rich sorry!"
It seems model 'e Magazine
If you don't have, "I better not insist '
A private one throws me on the way '
That capping in the Lambo 'is undefeated
I had for the subway area
From Jordans has the retros
One made to you today
And tomorrow I return and get it
