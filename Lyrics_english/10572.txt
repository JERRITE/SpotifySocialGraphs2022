Missed a Spot Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know I'm in your head
When you're not in my bed
Miss that shake in my thighs
When you're lonely
Only you get it right
That's why you get it twice
I don't have to be nice
When you're lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something in the air
And, baby, I know what you're after
It's all in the details
And every inch of me matters
[Chorus]
I know you love it when you go down under
Rain fallin', yeah, we makin' thunder
Findin' shelter underneath these covers
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer
I know you love it when you go down under
I'll be moving for you like no other
So much body for your lips to discover
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, go back, go back
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back
I think you missed a spot
Mmm, go back, go back (Go back, back)
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back
I think you missed a spot

[Verse 2]
You wanna hit it, wanna hear me hit a high note
I let you rub it, touch it, lick up on this fine hoe, hmm
Ooh, wine that back
This tropical nani got you running back (Oh-oh)
Bounce that ass in your face (Woah-oh)
While I ride your wave
Baby, you just hit the lottery
Ms. Jane on your lips, baby
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You know there's something in the air
And, baby, I know what you're after
It's all in the details
And every inch of me matters

[Chorus]
I know you love it when you go down under
Rain fallin' yeah, we makin' thunder
Findin' shelter underneath these covers
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer
I know you love it when you go down under
I'll be moving for you like no other
So much body for your lips to discover
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, go back, go back (Go back)
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back (Go back, back, back)
I think you missed a spot
Mmm, go back, go back (Hey)
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back (Yeah, yeah)
I think you missed a spot
[Chorus]
I know you love it when you go down under (Oh, woah)
Rain fallin' yeah, we makin' thunder (Yeah)
Findin' shelter underneath these covers
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer
I know you love it when you go down under
I'll be moving for you like no other
So much body for your lips to discover
I'ma love ya 'til the end of summer (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, go back, go back  (Go back, back, back)
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back (Go back)
I think you missed a spot (Hey, yeah)
Mmm, go back, go back
I hate to be like that, but
Mmm, go back, go back (Go back, back, back)
I think you missed a spot2Embed
