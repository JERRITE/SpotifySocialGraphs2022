Box #10 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well out of southern Illinois
Come a down home country boy
He's gonna make it in the city
Playin' guitar in the studio
Well he hadn't been there an hour
When he met a Broadway flower
You know she took him for his money
And she left him in a cheap motel

[Verse 2]
Well it's easy for you to see
That that country boy is me
Tell me how'm I ever gonna break the news
To the folks back home
Well I was gonna be a big success
But that sure ended up a mess
And in the process, I got messed up too
[Chorus]
Hello, mom and dad, I hate to call collect
But I ain't got a cent to my name
Sleepin' in the hotel doorway
And tonight, they say it's gonna rain
And if I could only get me some money
I'd be back on my feet again
Send it in care of the Sunday Mission Box Number 10, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, out of southern Illinois
Still worry about their boy
But this boy's goin' home
Soon's he gets the fare
Well, as soon as I got the bread
I got a pop upside my head
You know they left me in an alley
Took my money and my guitar too

[Chorus]
Hello, mom and dad, I hate to call collect
But I ain't got a cent to my name
I'm sleepin' in the hotel doorway
And tonight, they say it's gonna rain
And if I could only get me some money
Yeah, I'd be back on my feet again
