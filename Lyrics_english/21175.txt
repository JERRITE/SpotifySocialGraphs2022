Paper Thin (Headhunterz Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you at the windowsill
The rain, it won't stop, the air is so chill
I never heard the words you said
The phone, it can't ring if the heart is dead
You carry 'round your box of glass
With wounds so sharp that they cut too fast
Runnin' when the sky comes down
Growin' more cracks when you can't be found, yeah

[Chorus]
I took your heart, and made it mine
Do my best to justify it
Call it pleasure, but it feels like pain
So how'd we let it get this way?
Your broken heart was just like mine
We built these walls and hid inside 'em
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin
[Post-Chorus]
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin

[Pre-Drop]
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin

[Drop]
And now you know I'm paper thin
And now you know I'm paper thin

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll just let you down
But look at those eyes, I'm thinkin' too loud
Maybe I'll just bide my time
So when it feels right, you can be mine, yeah
Didn't know I'd be so late
Drinking all night, numbing that shame
Guessing I'll be careful now
I'm holding your past, I'll carry you out

[Chorus]
I took your heart, and made it mine
Do my best to justify it
Call it pleasure, but it feels like pain
So how'd we let it get this way?
Your broken heart was just like mine
We built these walls and hid inside 'em
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin

I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin

[Drop]
And now you know I'm paper thin
And now you know I'm paper thin

[Outro]
Don't lie to us, don't lie to us
Don't hide from us
Or anything, or anyone
It will make me spin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Don't lie to us, don't lie to us
Don't hide from us
Or anything, or anyone
It will make me spin
And now you know I'm paper-thinEmbed
