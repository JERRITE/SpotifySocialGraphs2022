The Best of You Lyrics[Verse: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
You say, "No, my love, that's not the moon"
That's God's fingernail and He's pointing at you"
Saying, "The world is at your feet
So what you're gonna do?"
Ooh, no, my love, that's not the moon
And we're singing old sad songs, the whole night through and
As the stars look on
I'm just looking at you
And when the words do come
They feel heavy as the truth
Yeah, the best of me, are just the pieces of the best of youYou might also likeEmbed
