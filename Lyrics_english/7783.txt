Doesnâ€™t Mean Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just 'cause it's slow, doesn't mean it's sad
Just 'cause it's wrong, doesn't mean it isn't right
Just 'cause it hurts, don't mean it's bad, no
Just come over, come over tonight

[Chorus]
Just 'cause we're fighting
Just 'cause we're crying
Just 'cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just 'cause I told you that it was over
That doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No, it doesn't mean goodbye
No, it doesn't mean goodbye
[Verse 2]
Just 'cause I watched you drive away
Doesn't mean I'm not still waiting by the door
Just 'cause you never hit the brakes
It don't mean you don't love me, don't love me anymore

[Chorus]
Just 'cause we're fighting
Just 'cause you're crying
Just 'cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just 'cause I told you that it was over
That doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No, it doesn't mean goodbye
No, it doesn't mean goodbye

[Bridge]
I hope you know that I'm not letting go
I will leave the light on

[Chorus]
Just 'cause we're fighting
Just 'cause you're crying
Just 'cause the stars in the sky, they aren't shining
Just 'cause I told you that it was over
That doesn't mean I don't need you by my side
No, it doesn't mean goodbye
No, it doesn't mean goodbye
It doesn't mean goodbyeYou might also likeEmbed
