Off-White Lyrics[Intro]
(10Fifty, I love you)

[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Off-white bitch with the Off-White, yeah
Off-White, Off-White, Off-White, yeah
Bitch, I got some money, broke niggas over there
Bullets takin' naps off, cuttin' through your hair
Neck, wrist, ooh, seasick
Ridin' with them sticks in a big-body C6
Doin' lil' bitch, suckin' me and you kiss-kiss
Geeked out my mind, pourin' fours in a Sunkist
Bop, bop (Woo)
Sippin' on Wock'
Opp niggas get popped
Pay a shooter with an iced-out clock
Shawty, yeah, you got one shot
Hen-dog, we ain't drinkin' on Scotch
Lil' bitch gotta slop my top
Took the top off the coupe, chop-chop
[Verse 1: Lil Gotit]
Nigga, stop cappin', you bitch, Gucci socks matching the fit
My bitch, she act like a brat, pretty bitch having a fit
You niggas cuffin' these thots, they mobbing dick, no kiss
Stick hit his head, no vest, you go through the stress, no check
M's on the 'net and we ain't rocking no Mets
Bitch, we get more money, y'all get the less (Skrrt)
Swerving that Lamb', Lamb'
12 caught me in a jam, damn
Getting fucked by a freak going mayhem (Woo, woo)
Take a Drac', took the shit to the vegan place
A lot of damn shots when the block got sprayed
Glock with a 31, shit took place
Dripping in BAPE and bitch, I go ape
Robin jeans match the Jimmy Choo
Big Raptor, yeah, fuck the coupe
Racks on your head, yeah, caught one too
Then I get some money, it's one or two
Got the pack from my brother, I ain't talking 'bout Mook'
My youngin' 'bout the money, he'll serve 'bout it too
Slime me, know it's a slime back too
I ain't change on you, all the blue hundreds is the only thing new

[Chorus: Lil Gotit & Lil Keed]
Off-white bitch with the Off-White, yeah (Off-White)
Off-White, Off-White, Off-White, yeah (Let's go)
Bitch, I got some money, broke niggas over there (No lie)
Bullets takin' naps off, cuttin' through your hair (No lie)
Neck, wrist, ooh, seasick (Shit)
Ridin' with them sticks in a big-body C6
Doin' lil' bitch, suckin' me and you kiss-kiss (Doin' her)
Geeked out my mind, pourin' fours in a Sunkist (Doin' her, doin' her)
Bop, bop (Bop-bop)
Sippin' on Wock'
Opp niggas get popped
Pay a shooter with an iced-out clock
Shawty, yeah, you got one shot
Hen-dog, we ain't drinkin' on Scotch
Lil' bitch gotta slop my top
Took the top off the coupe, chop-chop

Uh, get the fuck out
Hey, what is the deal?
I left some kids in her mouth
Nothin' but Chanel on these jeans when I step out
Know I'ma throw racks or slime when I step out
I got some pigeons, get high like a pilot
Cat coming in, that pack coming in
I ride with F&N 'cause I'm blessed like a choir
Pullin' up Hellcat, switched out vans
Real freak ho fucking all top ten
Car geeked out, you don't know what I'm in
Richard came froze, Ice Age on the wrist
I'm the real young GOAT, put me top of the list
Gotit young GOAT, put him top of the list
Got money then I chopped the whole top, bitch
Glock that I got don't pop, bitch
Y'all niggas smoking on woo-woo-woos
Had your ho blowing like a flute, flute, flute
Just like berries, I got juice
Fucking bad bitches, yeah, I have a cane too
No NAV, but your ho getting tap, tap
Catch me on the block and I'm shooting crap, craps
Riding Trackhawk, her head in my lap
Off-White jeans on me but they came black
[Chorus: Lil Gotit]
Off-white bitch with the Off-White, yeah
Off-White, Off-White, Off-White, yeah
Bitch, I got some money, broke niggas over there
Bullets takin' naps off, cuttin' through your hair
Neck, wrist, ooh, seasick
Ridin' with them sticks in a big-body C6
Doin' lil' bitch, suckin' me and you kiss-kiss
Geeked out my mind, pourin' fours in a Sunkist
Bop, bop (Woo)
Sippin' on Wock'

Pay a shooter with an iced-out clock
Shawty, yeah, you got one shot
Hen-dog, we ain't drinkin' on Scotch
Lil' bitch gotta slop my top
Took the top off the coupe, chop-chop7Embed
