Gotham Lyrics [words of "Gotham"]

[Intro]
Twinsmatic
They turned on the projector, everything is black here
I have pure Bogota, I am moving on Gotham, Gotham City
I am moving on Gotham City

[Verse 1]
Always in this as Rocco in Pucelle Ass
Omnipresent strong as Congolese in rue de Brussels
Mount my biggest bottle and the little one and cast
I saw it below, garter belt, I had tongue hung like Valbuena
There is only one therefore everyone recognizes the Duke
Real soldiers recognize whores
Real stos-ba recognize uc '
I break lives but I repair
Frenchy, they prefer my cock that my accent because I don't have any
Right of Anthony Joshua Take the Boca
ME-CA money pays the lawyer
I'm real like Rocinha, Carioca
I present Jimmy twice, Ray Liotta
[Chorus]
They turned on the projector, everything is black here
I have pure Bogota, I am moving on Gotham, Gotham City
Everything is black here
They turned on the projector, everything is black here
I have pure Bogota, I am moving on Gotham, Gotham City
Everything is black here

[Verse 2]
The Boule'Zer is competition
I will get peace by demolition
Take a missionary my mission as a missionary
You're good, it's normal we choose cute net
I put it in a calm, I suck the bill
To all the gaps in the region
Get on board, you're at home
Here, a lot of mothers we kiss
Many mothers of large families, alas
Here low, I am allowed a lot of deviations
The whores come below, no, don't look in the floors
Even no more hatred towards you, you're so naze
I want to scratch my davos but so wide
GSXR at your door, you just left the ball
I am in the dm at your witch, she validated the lease
I made sucking by a divine beauty at the wheel of a Mercedes
I said that I loved big asses so she wants to refrain her buttocks
I'm going to send it to Colombia, Gonzalez will do it again in S
We have plugs everywhere, Russia, Bondy, Los Angeles
You might also like [refrain]
They turned on the projector, everything is black here
I have pure Bogota, I am moving on Gotham, Gotham City
Everything is black here
They turned on the projector, everything is black here
I have pure Bogota, I am moving on Gotham, Gotham City
Everything is black here13embed
