Opps Oh My Freestyle (Jews in Paris) Lyrics[Intro]
Suck my dick, suck my dick
Ball so hard, you can't find me, suck my dick
Ball so hard, you can't find me, suck my dick
Ball so hard, ball so hard, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, fuckin', stop...
Here we go!

Good evening, uh, my name is Speak
My bangs are luxurious, my dick is like a Burmese python, and my flow is out of fucking control
Let's go
[Verse 1: Speak]
Hebrew vampire baby that's Jew blood
Angel dust fun dip candy coated new drug
Buzz like a beeper, choke hold sleeper
Its them facebook lurkers and them second hand sneakers
Firsthand smoker, switch blade poker
Pinching for the bread when I burn you with the toaster
Yikes! Daddy got a brand new weapon
So we shooting rednecks while they line dance stepping
Achey, breaky, front side fakie
Its the back side board shop, bitch I'm crazy
Came from the school of the young Royce Gracie
Stealing from the Nordstrom boosting from Macy's grey
Clenet sitting up in my drive way bought that bitch after I
Drop five way, word to Matt Martian
I'm Speak arson, I'm Rick Rubin sike, Alan Parsons
I'm Phil spector, gun and a crossbow
Wall of sound steez with a brain like Rosco
Cold chain, cold vein all gas propane
No shame, no fame, fuck 'em all, profane
Yup, rapping is as easy as it comes
With a nose full of blow and a beard full of crumbs
And my face so numb, now I'm twiddling my thumbs
Sitting nonchalant here easy as it comes
I'm thinking that this all really ain't a big deal
But I'm ethic and I'm talented so I must appeal
To a strange sub-culture that you couldn't tap into
Talk about my hood past, that ain't an issue
I go where I want, I say what I want
And I fathered your steez, what more can you want?
Yup I can nurture, it's in my nature
'Til I pulled a drive by in a 59 LaSaber
Wanna catch a fade bitch you could get the taper
Or you could have your organs eaten by the mad cow tapeworm
Barf on my scarf, silk from Hélène
La dolce vita leisure life of lean, swag..
