Running Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
These days you barely even say my name
Like you don't really feel the same
I'm wondering whats to blame
These nights I fall asleep wondering where you are
It feels like we're falling apart
And its only breaking my heart

Cause if being with you means being alone
And never knowing when you're coming home
Then I guess I'm better off on my own
[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that makes forgetting
Forgetting everything we've had
Instead I keep coming, keep coming
I keep running back

Cause I keep forgetting
Forgetting you treat me so bad
So I keep on coming, keep coming
I keep running back

I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back, I keep coming back

[Verse 2]
My friends say that I should leave you behind
And stop wasting all my time
They tell me that I am out of my mind
But I know that what we both share is real
And I've been willing to deal
With the way that you're making me feel

Cause if being with you means being alone
And never knowing when you're coming home
Then I guess I'm better off on my own
You might also like[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that makes forgetting
Forgetting everything we've had
Instead I keep coming, keep coming
I keep running back

Cause I keep forgetting
Forgetting you treat me so bad
So I keep on coming, keep coming
I keep running back

I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back, I keep coming back

Ma ma ma mama caught up
We done all heard the same story
Just different authors this book crazy
Always a lady looking for love where there's a lame
They might could be together
They fight to be together
Aight to be together
Shorty yeah he cheated
You say you don't need it
Turn around and leave it
Oh he back next week
Fuss... Fight
And then the whole thing repeat
Like nothing ever happened
Dat was just rapping
No publishing
Shorty you knew that he don't got the same government
Lil mama can't move on
But it's her fault she struggling
She can't... move... on
[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that makes forgetting
Forgetting everything we've had
Instead I keep coming, keep coming
I keep running back

I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back, I keep coming back

I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back (I keep coming back)
I keep coming back, I keep coming back to you1Embed
