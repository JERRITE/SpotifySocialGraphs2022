So Fine Lyrics[Intro: Haile]
I do the dance for ya'
Run it up fast for ya'
I'll be the man for ya'
Do what I can for ya'
Ain't coming last for ya'
Run it up fast for ya'
I do the dance for ya'
Run it up, run it up (Woo)

[Chorus: Haile]
I be so, so fine, with this shit (So, so fine)
Had to run a mile on that bitch (Run a mile)
Oh, you know it is, what it is, yeah (What it is!)
I got magic, watch me do the drip (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now
[Verse 1: Avelino]
(Uh), Big amounts
How'm I gonna get these figures? Shit to figure out
Never got a look in, I just had to listen out
If all he's got for me's an ounce of B, then tell that nigga bounce
'Cause when shit was tough, I was tough as shit, for the fun of it
Now my undercover lover, loves me for the coverage
I made drinks, could've built a pub, with the publishing
But I'm tryna build an empire, whilst you're watching it (yeah)
I mind my business on my own
Ironically I got a company, that's with my bros
And there's tonnes of women, that's relationship goals
I'm still soul-searching, that's why I don't trust a soul, I'm a lone wolf
Make her drop her top, I've got no roof
When I pull up on her in the winter, I'm a cold yout'
Where do you go to? When you're that go to nigga
I'ma go from selling O's, to the O2, (woo) yeah

[Chorus: Haile]
I be so, so fine, with this shit (So, so fine)
Had to run a mile on that bitch (Run a mile)
Oh, you know it is, what it is, yeah (What it is!)
I got magic, watch me do the drip (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now

I remember having nothing
I still speak about the bottom
I'm the topic of discussion, oh (Yeah)
Still having fun, at the functions
I impress her, then I press her, listening to touch ah button
I'm so fresh, so clean, drinking til' I'm lean, no promethazine
Cash rules everything around me, they don't get no cream
I just handled mamas rent, so no rental please
But I might just go and put my Barbie in some Kenzo jeans
This life never chose me, it's the life I chose
We just made a killing, could've died I know
My calling was so instrumental, xylophone
Could've left with keys, but we left on a higher note
Yeah, I've been a sinner
But I gave my all, I pray my lord is a forgiver
Now I got tears of joy, crying me a river
I just hit the lick, and now a niggas drowning in some liquor
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Haile]
I be so, so fine, with this shit (So, so fine)
Had to run a mile on that bitch (Run a mile)
Oh, you know it is, what it is, yeah (What it is!)
I got magic, watch me do the drip (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now (Woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now3Embed
