Show me lyrics ["show me"]

Allow me
Cool off your memory
Remind you

Allow me
Cling to our history
Ay, ay

If loneliness is playing a joke and random
He mocks without thinking how much it hurts
Will be missing for this wound
Show me
That my murmurs are still yours
Show me
That silence was not enough
To erase the brands of my kisses
To get all the poison from you
The same that killed us

Dowo me
That pride was already
He's gone

Oh, he left

Look at me
Do not hide from my eyes
They have not yet fired

Forgive me, huh
For having put us against
Without knowing what could lose you

If loneliness is playing a joke and random
He mocks without thinking how much it hurts
Will be missing for this wound
You might also like me.
That my murmurs are still yours
Show me
That silence was not enough
To erase the brands of my kisses
To get all the poison from you
The same that killed us

Show me
That pride already left
He's gone

You don't forget me, you don't forgive me
La-ra-la-la, Yea
You don't forget me, nor will you forgive me

Show me (don't forget me, you don't forgive me)
That pride has already left
