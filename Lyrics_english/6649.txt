Childhood Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1]
I dream a hundred dreams a minute
I'm deep inside what I construct
So there's no use don't even bother
Tonight is not the night for us
[Verse 2]
I have a million shapes a decade
I'm past the point of no return
So don't even call don't even bother
'Cause I can't make you my concern

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Cannot hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know?

[Chorus]
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my...

[Verse 3]
So as the night time hits my window
Sudden move to gain the lights
'Cause I'm not even close to done yet
No I won't leave I'm too inspired

And when the dawn emerges slowly
I realize the night is passed
The sounds I made were visionary
Looking forward to go back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Cannot hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know?

[Chorus]
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Hmm-mmm-mmm

[Chorus]
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind2Embed
