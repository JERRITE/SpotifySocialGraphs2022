Sunset in July Lyrics[Verse 1: Nick Hexum]
Well I can show you how it is done, there’s no competitors
Time to say goodnight to the sun, it takes a better turn
Wake up, it’s not your typical rehash
Something unpredictable, do you really know that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Hexum with Doug "SA" Martinez]
I will remember this one
I’m just on pure momentum
Rock out and break up your own suppression
I like to see you having fun in the setting sun
[Chorus: Both]
Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
Ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it’s getting me high
Time is flying by, whoa oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Doug "SA" Martinez]
January, February, March into May
And here’s June with a tune just to brighten my day
Sun setting in July I’m gonna fade ‘em away
'Cause time is sliding, time is sliding on hear what I say, wow!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Doug "SA" Martinez]
If you believe that, believe that
Back up, back up you need that, need that
Space and time and time and space is my way
I’m forever in existence, I’m forever okay, wow!

[Chorus: Both]
Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
Ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it’s getting me high
Time is flying by, whoa-oh-oh

The time of our lives
Here, I was happy
The days flying by
Come closer to me
I could never knock out all the things that you've given
Throughout the multiverse 'bout anything could be true
Might as well make up anything to believe in
It’s made inside of you

[Chorus: Both]
Sunset in July
Rockers by my side and time is flying by
Ba da dop dop da dee-yah
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it’s getting me high
Time is flying by, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro: Both]
Watching you dancing and having the time of your life
And it’s getting me high
Time is flying by, whoa oh-oh-oh2Embed
