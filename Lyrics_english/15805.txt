Do not worry about me Lyrics [letter of "Don't worry about me" Ft Vic Deal, Mañas Rufino & Lianna]

[Verse 1: raw]
Sharing a very cheap with a Luka in his hand
And I watch on TV the shit that is hitting
What are they giving? Urban gender?
(Hey) I can't believe that people seem Bacano
Difficult to be MC in the city of Medellín
With a dream so deep that he doesn't let sleep
Money to live, resign myself to the cubicle
Tie my tie and stop suffering
Buy the outfit at the mall
To show off the outfit in the mall
Walk the city in an Italian car
With a monalisa that does not release the cell phone
God, tell me that this cannot be all
Smile without being happy, pretending and making me the fool
Nothing personal, this is for everyone
How many retired just before their choir?
But:
[Hook: Lianna]
Don't worry about me, My Baby
I'm going to continue here, My Baby
Don't worry about me, My Baby
I'm going to continue here, My Baby

[Interlude: cold metrics]
If I have already, eggs now, now. That was the major warning. We were going to rehearse in Mateo's car and I walked to my tongue, I told them, when we least thought Nea, because all the muscles were embedded
They took me to a pharmacy and bought me some things
Yes, I gave myself a lot of cap, I can't continue like this

[Verse 2: Mañas]
Au, hey, nobody saw it
I broke it at the concert and the plane went
They were 10 hours on the road
Thinking about the whole life and the previous show
For nothing I change me
And although I miss things I have the world in my hands
The rap in the neighborhoods, in the stage, where we recorded
And there are vinyls on the floor
Our style smells from the outside, it seems stew
Wolf spell that sucks, accurate aim
You can call it caresses
Au, you can call it love
You don't have to tell me to feel the best
Cousin, ah, I do the favor without heart
Bájame del Pedestal that I am only one more egg

I don't want a Ferrari or Maserati or a Kia
I want to see the pelaos singing the letters of mine
Rome was not built in a day
Tell him who does not buy a beat and dreams with royalties
And, if I get to the top with rhymes I buy jewels
To be able to commit them if I am in the pot
I go in like Troy's horse
To kill the enemy with the issues that I am
Already, they don't like our style a lining
It will be because we did not pretend to live in a nose
My themes will not be pa 'them, pa' las chimbas or the jet
Will it be because I lack the accent of Puerto Rican?
As Forrest Corro, I go to each new rhyme
Instead of putting vessels, I put roe
And the most and most approve of me, that goes!
I care about an ass because they don't buy rap records
They do not buy rap records
Already, I care if they approve
They do not buy rap records

[Hook: Lianna]
Don't worry about me, My Baby
I'm going to continue here, My Baby
Don't worry about me, My Baby
I'm going to continue here, here, hereembed
