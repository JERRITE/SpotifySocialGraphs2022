Angel Eyez LyricsOk the way you looking at me got me feeling some type of way
I'd do whatever just to make you smile that's the price I'd pay
Don't matter what the weather, it don't matter the time of day

Dont't feel the same without you, by my side where you gotta stay
You make everything better when you walk in the room
That look in your eye make me feel like I walked on the moon
No you don't gotta say a thing for me to know what you thinking
Yeah you an angel in the flesh, I thank thе Lord for your visit

I cherish every momеnt spent with you
This meant for two
Ima be there til the end for you, forever true
Baby you're so baby, you make my heart go crazy
I wanna give it all to you, there's never no or maybe
Been on the low low lately, I been oh so jaded
You my go to lady, I stay hopeful daily
I just pray that you gonna be there when it's all said and done
Nowhere to run, lets take a walk on the sunYou might also likeEmbed
