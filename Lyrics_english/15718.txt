LOVE TO LYRICS [Verse 1]
After the threshold of my fears
Of my mistakes and my failures
After the wounds of the past
And the love already forgotten

[Verse 2]
After the innocence there was a day
After the irony of those years
It has only been immense
The cruel spine of disappointment
[Bridge]
You get to my life like a sun
Like the soft transparency of love
Like the aroma of the breeze in the morning
Erasing my pain forever

[Chorus 1]
Love again
One more time
Be born in you
In your eyes
Filling with your light
The Shadows of my loneliness

[Verse 2]
After the innocence there was a day
After the irony of those years
It has only been immense
The cruel spine of disappointment

[Bridge]
You get to my life like a sun
Like the soft transparency of love
Like the aroma of the breeze in the morning
Erasing my pain forever
You Might Also Like [chorus 1]
Love again
One more time
Be born in you
In your eyes
Filling with your light
The Shadows of my loneliness

[Chorus 2]
Love again
Feel that
You stay with me
That you will not leave me
And I will be able to live
The sweet love you give me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Love again
One more time
Be born in you
In your eyes
Filling with your light
The Shadows of my loneliness
[Chorus 2]
Love again
Feel that
You stay with me
That you will not leave me
And I will be able to live
The sweet love that you give me
