This Scene is Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
This scene is dead, but I'm still restless
An hour or so until last call, I guess
I shouldn't even be here, much less
Drinking myself into excess

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not going home until I'm done

[Chorus]
Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun
[Verse 2]
Well, everything's another excuse
To keep from doing what I want to
Like, I would really love to kiss you
But I guess I'm in no condition

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not going home with no one

[Chorus]
Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun

[Pre-Chorus]
I said that's it
I'm not going home with no one
I'm not going home with no one
I'm not going home with no one

[Chorus]
Come on, get gone
Come on, get gone
Come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been fun
You can't go home, the night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been funYou might also like1Embed
