There are no Lyricsletra words of "There are no words" 

 [Verse] 
 I would like to dawn and not know about you; 
 Look at you far; discover again 
 With the anxiety that you will happen 
 Near me, maybe you will stay 

 [Chorus] 
 There are no words 
 New forms there are no 
 But my soul is yours 
 Every day more 
 [Verse 2] 
 It is good to remember but not stay like this 
 Well what has already happened brought us here 
 To be together there is no obligation: 
 What unites us is just the heart 

 [Chorus] 
 There are no words 
 New forms there are no 
 But my soul is yours 
 Every day more 

 There are no words 
 New forms there are no 
 But my soul is yours 
 Every day more 

 [Outro] 
 There is no... 
 There is no... 

 There is no longer ... (there is no longer ...) You Might Also Likeembed
