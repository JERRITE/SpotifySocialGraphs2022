Clean My Wounds Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see the world through bloodshot eyes
Streets filled with blood from distant lies
The dogs of war never compromise
There ain't no time for rearranging

[Pre-Chorus]
"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time
[Chorus]
(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
I'm all over you, in time my mind is changing
Oh, knock it down

[Verse 2]
Black on black gives me a heart attack
And the silence makes it deadly
Some choose to kill with simple will
I've seen them fall, fast and steady

[Pre-Chorus]
"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time

[Chorus]
(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
I'm all over you, in time my mind is changing

Twist of fate won't give me a break
And myself, I'm slow and tired
I've got to rise with these bloodshot eyes
But I keep falling when I'm higher

[Pre-Chorus]
"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time

[Chorus]
(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
We are bleeding sins and our sins are always fading

[Outro]
Oh, fading
Oh, fading
Oh, fading

Oh, knock it down, knock it down
Oh, knock it down, knock it down
Oh, knock it down, knock it down
Oh, knock it down2Embed
