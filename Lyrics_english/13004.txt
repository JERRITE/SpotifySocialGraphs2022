It Almost Worked Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everyone looks the same in this town
You can hardly tell the difference
She stayed at home and figured out how
To will herself out of existence

[Chorus 1]
She gave it a try
She closed her eyes
She didn't know how it'd feel
She just hoped that it wouldn't hurt
It almost worked
[Verse 2]
They lie right to your face in this town
But what did you expect
She wishes that she could have seen what they saw
That left them so unimpressed

[Chorus 2]
So she gave it a try
She started to cry
She said to herself, "Well, at least it could have been worse"
And it almost workedYou might also likeEmbed
