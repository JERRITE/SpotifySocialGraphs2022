I go later Lyrics ["I go later"]

[Intro]
What, then, love? Where are you?
I have a while that I don't see you
(Even if I love him ')
Where are you? Want to see you
(Even if I want it, I don't know—)

[Chorus]
Even if I want it ', it is not going to be' (it is not going to aim ')
Because this heart already used it
That if it is not with me, then, 'it doesn't go' '
At the end of a bad day I am later '
She knows that she is good (she knows)
Therefore, and that in no cd she sounds (Nah-Ah)
The only problem: (What was it?)
That the ass does not e 'mine, e' alien (ey)
[Verse 1]
Calls me from time to time
Pa 'see' what this' doing and what is missing (Skrr, skrr!; I looked for you)
It behaves fresh
What happens that does not arrive ', baby? I'm waiting

[Bridge]
A vece 'somo' tre 'because she has more inspiration
Asked (give him without a condom)
La-La Despatillé, I shouted it ', then enrolled it
And asked (give him another session)
He says that I sorcened her, that I am her ugly (ey)
When his ass was made, I gave him first
In Toa 'I position them' Tenemo 'Video'
I am getting over, I read that
(The one who rules is me)

[Chorus]
Although-although-although I want it ', it is not going to can' (it is not going to can ')
Because this heart already used to it, he
That if it is not with me, then, 'it doesn't go' '
At the end of a bad day I am later '
She knows that she is good (she knows)
Therefore, and that in no cd she sounds (Nah-Ah)
The only problem:
That the ass does not e 'mine, e' alien (ey)

All sculpture
I enjoy it more 'when' tá naked (naked; ey)
If you keep freating
Surely he will be 'my future (he already knows')
I like how to handle the situation
Have a very hard story (very hard, ah)
But I have 'what I see' at discretion
Thus knows better, but it is crazy
A VECE 'I feel fear (Yeh-eh)
But maybe it's better (Nah, Nah)
I know you have 'your situation
But the custom is more 'strong than love
