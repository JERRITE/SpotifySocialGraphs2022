Slow Train Comin’ Lyrics[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
I see the slow train coming
Up over the hill
Still got miles to go
But even so
I feel the shaking still

[Verse 1: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
The light at Thompson’s Station
In the last seconds of dusk
Paints a funeral, so beautiful
To the memory of us
And now I'm waiting, by the phone
A slowly breaking heart that knows
You're gonna make me, lonesome when you go
[Verse 2: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
The bones down by the river
Beneath the waning moon
While the crows feed on
The carrion
They’ll feed on us too soon
I sold my heart for stolen gold
I played my part so I suppose
You’re gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
I see the slow train coming
Up over the hill
Still got miles to go
But even so
I feel the shaking stillYou might also like1Embed
