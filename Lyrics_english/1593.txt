Let Her Go (Let Him Go) - acoustic LyricsWell you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love him when you let him go
Only know you've been high when you feelin' low
Only hate the road when your missing home
Only know you love him when you let him go
Then you let him go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day to make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see him when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
Well you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love him when you let him go ooh
Only know you've been high when you feelin' low
Only hate the road when your missing home
Only know you love him when you let him go
And you let him go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your hart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
We'll you see him when you fall asleep
But never to touch or never to keep
Cuz you loved to much and you dived to deep

Well you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love him when you let him go ooh
Only know you've been high when you feelin' low
Only hate the road when your missing home
Only know you love him when you let him go
Then you let him go

Then you let him go
Then you let him go
You might also likeWell you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love him when you let him go ooh
Only know you've been high when you feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love him when you let him go
Then you let him go
Then you let him go
Then you let him goEmbed
