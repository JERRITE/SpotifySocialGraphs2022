Outside the Lyrics market [letter from "off the market"]

[Verse 1]
How do you pretend that in your dreams do not want to leave me?
Don't get away from you
If my cora always for you always explodes
This fuckin 'smell of your beach
Since 2010 I want this feeling to leave
But it has been very difficult
Very, very, very difficult for me
[Chorus]
I regret too much
For that hurried kiss
That should never have happened
You weren't you, it was the wrong moment
I regret too much
Baby, time has already molded me
And now that I am prepared
I find out, Baby, who is' out of the market

[Post-car]
Oh oh
And now that I am prepared
I feel, baby, who is' out of the market, he
It has been very, very, very, very difficult for me
It has been very, very, very, very difficult for me

[Saying]
Because I love you too much, huh
I love you too much, uh, huh, wuh!
I'm still learning that your happiness goes first
I love you too much (I love you too much)
Mommy, I still love you too much, oh, uh-uh
Just give me time, give me a momentary
You know 'that I am a warrior (no)

Grieth to the world that you ere 'Guerrero
Life is blood, sweat and fire
Move your body and eternal happiness
And if you want to send everything to shit
Send it all, send it all
Life is blood, sweat and fire

[Saying]

I love you too much, uh, huh
And I guess I'm still learning
That my happiness is first1embed
