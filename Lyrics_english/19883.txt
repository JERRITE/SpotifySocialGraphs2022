The Other Side Lyrics[BARNUM]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't wanna chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery
And walls you keep in
So trade that typical
For something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible
A king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see
Don't you wanna get away
From the same old part you gotta play?
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[PHILLIP]
Okay, my friend
You wanna cut me in
Well, I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you
And that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells
And we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

Don't you know that I'm okay
With this uptown part I get to play?
'Cause I got what I need
And I don't wanna take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine?
I don't need to see the other side
You might also like[BARNUM]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery and parties and plays?

[PHILLIP]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[BARNUM]
But you would finally live a little, finally, laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream, and it'll
Wake you up and cure your achin'
Take your walls and start 'em breakin'
Now that's a deal that seems worth takin'
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[PHILLIP]
Well, it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[BARNUM]
Well, fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[PHILLIP]
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
[BARNUM]
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?

[PHILLIP]
Fifteen

[BARNUM]
I'd do eight

[PHILLIP]
Twelve

[BARNUM]
Maybe nine

[PHILLIP]
Ten

[BARNUM & PHILLIP]
Don't you wanna get away
To a

[PHILLIP]
Whole

[BARNUM]
New

[BARNUM & PHILLIP]
Part you're gonna play?

[PHILLIP]
'Cause I got what you

[BARNUM]
Need, so come

[BARNUM & PHILLIP]
With me and take the ride
To the other side

[BARNUM]
So if you do like I do

[PHILLIP]
So if you do like me

[BARNUM & PHILLIP]
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're goin' to the other side

[PHILLIP]
So if you do like I do

[BARNUM]
To the other side

[PHILLIP]
So if you do like me

[BARNUM]
Goin' to the other side

[PHILLIP]
'Cause if we do, we're goin'

[BARNUM & PHILLIP]
To the other side
We're goin' to the other side55Embed
