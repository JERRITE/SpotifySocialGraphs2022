Puty Lyrics ["Puty" ft letter. Jowell and Ñejo]

[Bridge: Koreko]
It has 80 cat 'Atrá', but only one forward
She likes men interesting '
One that is always elegant
But with a row flow

[Chorus: Koreko]
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party

[Verse 1: jowell]
If she knew she is the girl of my dream '
She loves and if you have no owner
I'm going to take it in less time
What she imagines, she doesn't know what I have

I will get pressure, it makes me lose the notion
Time is exhausted when it entered 'heat
My puty girl, it's fine has medicine
It makes me fly, full adrenaline

Get out crazy with me, realize ready
That I am your friend, who fills you with the navel
Puty, on these theme 'Playing Call of Duty
That totito, which smells like Tuti Frutti

[Chorus: Koreko]
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party
You Might Also Likeella is my Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party

[Verse 2: Koreko]
I'm going to give you advice
That may never give them
Stop looking so much in the mirror
Remember that the wallet kills the gallant

I explain myself, I'm not a pretty boy
But when I have a baby I get very rich
Spring, and that is not even practical
Everything comes out like that since I was a child

The night fell
My kitten was prepared
The party already caught
And there it is that I go

[Chorus: Koreko]
Together with my Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
She is my puty, (Puty, Puty, Puty, Puty)
Even if I looked at all the party

[Verse 3: Ñejo]
It is Putonga or rather puty path
You at the same time taking area in Miami
Drinking a smuti and a mask
In the face pa'l cutis

But when
You go out for Huyele Street, don't get Rookie
Bellaquea with everyone, but it's mine more
In the cell he has more than my number and that of his mother

I throw me on whattsapp and fast I arrive
I put it in to'a 'the poses, I never refuse
I do not take off a second, we have not
Finished the first and is already asking for the second

She tells me that I am that
Your teddy bear, but I make buff
Why is she my puty
And that he fucks the one who listens to me

[Outro]
She is my puty
Puty, Porka like Jamsha's
Putonga like Ghetto's
What else?

I'm with the Koreco
Directly from Mexico
Koreko
Controlling from Mexico City
But this time
With Jowell
Tell me Jowell
Ñejo el Broko
Fame All Star
Dimlo Mauro, Mauro Dembow
Mexico and Puerto Rico
THE TITRERITO
Ladies and gentlemen
Directly from Mexico
Urban talent, for the world
Koreko

I'm with the Puty Puty
The Totito smelled of Tuti Frutti
Look, he says that milk on the face
Pa'l complex serves, I see you Lolambed
