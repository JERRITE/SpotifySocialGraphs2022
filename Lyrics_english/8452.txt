Fierado Lyricsanoche ...
You overflowing with passion ...
All my bed ...
And among the rain you made love ...
As I didn't think ...
Last night...
When you deliver fakes to be ...
Quiet beast ...
And you tangled me in your kisses ...
Full of illusion ...
You, my quiet beast ...
Last night...
Among the savanas stroking you
Your sweet lips' so wrapping me
Making you mine, making you a woman
I did it all night
Among the savanas stroking you
Your sweet lips' so wrapping me
Making you mine, making you a woman
I did it all night

Is what happened
I don't know how it happened
(I did it all night ...)
In the early morning '
It was as happened
(I did it all night ...)
With the moon, to the sun's rays
(I did it all night ...)
And sweat in my bed alone I am
(I did it all night ...)

Your fierce already arrives
Turned into savage
I want that in silence
You show me your courage
I want that in the corner of the bed I corner me
Don't make me pull, and come soft stuck
Your fierce already arrives
Turned into savage
I want that in silence
You show me your courage
I want that in the corner of the bed I corner me
Don't make me pull, and come soft stuck
And give it, what your beast arrives
Glow, the Gangster cat, the bandit
The one who achieves what he wants
When you come to desire
The one that last night was hot beast

Full of illusion ...
You, my quiet beast ...
Last night...

I can not imagine
That this is not real
If it was just a dream
Don't let me wake up
And get the illusion
That by my side you are
Pa 'to' the night to love you
I can not imagine
That this is not real
If it was just a dream
Don't let me wake up
And get the illusion
That by my side you are
Pa 'to' the night to love you

This is Glow!

You know!
The quiet beast!
But not tamed!

This is reggaeton!

Mario!
Tell me!
