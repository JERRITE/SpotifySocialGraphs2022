Paperweight LyricsBeen up all night
Staring at you
Wondering what's on your mind
I've been this way
With so many before
But this feels like the first time

You want the sunrise
To go back to bed
I want to make you laugh
Mess up my bed with me
Kick off the covers I'm waiting
Every word you say
I think I should write down
Don't want to forget come daylight

Happy to lay here
Just happy to be here
I'm happy to know you
Play me a song
Your newest one
Please leave your taste on my tongue

Paperweight on my back
Cover me like a blanket

Mess up my bed with me
Kick off the covers I'm waiting
Every word you say
I think I should write down
Don't want to forget come daylight

And no need to worry
That's wastin time
And no need to wonder
What's been on my mind
It's you, it's you, it's you
You might also likeEvery word you say
I think I should write down
Don't want to forget come daylight

And i give up
I let you win
You win cause I'm not counting
You made it back
To sleep again
Wonder what you're dreamingEmbed
