Pick Up The Pace Lyrics[Verse 1]
I kicked myself when you did not show
A clue to a puzzle that I thought I'd know
A reflection in a window and it's not quite clear
Just why the hell you disappeared

[Chorus]
I have searched all along these rows of terraces for you
I have searched all the terraces for you
Oh, but we'll never get through anything
If we're moving at this rate
Honey, you've got, you've got
You've gotta pick up the pace
[Verse 2]
Drunken boys scream something crass
And they're all reeling in the aftermath
They swore they saw you just this week past
The ball is dropped, so the chain reacts

[Chorus]
I have searched all along these rows of terraces for you
I have searched all the terraces for you
Oh, but we'll never get through anything
If we're moving at this rate
Honey, you've got, you've got
You've gotta pick up the pace
Oh, pick up the pace

[Verse 3]
And I know sometimes it's rough
But you can't act out every time you've had enough
Oh, I know you've made mistakes
But it's time you started picking up the pace
Pick up the pace

[Chorus]
I have searched all along these rows of terraces for you
I have searched all the terraces for you
Oh, but we'll never get through anything
If we're moving at this rate
Honey, you've got, you've got
You've gotta pick up the pace
Pick up the paceYou might also likeEmbed
