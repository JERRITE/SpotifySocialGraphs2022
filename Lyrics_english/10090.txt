Revenge Lyrics [text of "revenge"]

[Verse 1]
My revenge is that your children listen to my texts
And they dream of becoming what you hate
My mission is to educate them to be rebellious
They all want to placing me like in rugby
You put the soul in peace, mine is at war
And first I told my mother, then to Universal
The disc most than status is ultimatum to the earth
Traveling to the island of Elba, isolates the grass
You throw rose petals because I have a real flow
Purple Weed, Orange G, floral theme
Yellow, green, purple, Aurora Boreale
For Germany machines, no Korean
I know that the world does not change, it is ruled
We want to look like those we spit shitting
They give us new vices, new shit
We take them all as the flu
My colleagues make over the naivety
Fans with personality disorders
Honesty, honesty teach high schools
Honesty, yes, the same that fuck mine
You still hope that the law does your interest
It's like asking if it is good for those who sell it
In my neighborhood we are green, but there is green
The children of the servants play, our people
Barona area, you know what I live in the front line
In the wardrobe I only have first -line clothes
And we were all friends before contracts
Before the money, but whoever changes are those who have not made them
Between saying and doing I know you have chosen to betray, infamous
I disgust money, but I love what you can buy us
For ten years that I no longer sell life at hours
And fifteen years that my mother looks at a place in the sun
[Refrain]
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
Follow the leader

[Verse 2]
The first rapper of the neighborhoods in the upper neighborhoods
The Trojan horse with others inside
Rappo as if I still had to establish me
On a demolition ball like Miley
The real luxury for those who have money is not to think about money
Does it bother you what I say? Why do you listen to?
It is precisely where nothing glitters that I see gold
And I don't see myself there, I see them
Death in small doses, you can buy everything in installments
My area: drug outlet
Boss of the new stuff, Bossanova
This in videos plays and live trembles like the joypad
The girls strips because I always put myself naked
Instead, you on many names, but you are nobody
So many ideas and many flows have copied me
That I understood that in rap there is not mine and yours
My hunger precedes me
Bring me up to the top, I have faith
Will vacilla and does not give
East side, Fra ', the sun beats by me
North side beat the Romanians
So many g in the living room
All at a table as if there is the G8 here
I paint Santi, Giotto
Let's cope with the market on their knees

Fotti, trafficking, cheating, steals, humilia, beats and exploits
SPEND, OSTENTATA, STEPS, SLOW, DRINK, FUCK, USA AND PUT
This is what he sells, this is what they want
If this is what wins, this is what they show

[Refrain]
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
I'm a leader, I'm not a boss
Follow the leader, follow the leader

[Verse 3]
No, that you cannot save the world, you can save yourself
Friendship is just a click, honor is just a tattoo
Love is a scoop that makes view, selling more
I say: "Fuck you", "Screw" type, "Fuck you" type
I would like to spit them to do what is more right
But the audience then hates you when the makeup unwinds
So scams, deceived, they will love you for this
The less value you have, the higher the price
You made loans to put yourself
Clothes that you cannot afford
Realpolitik, Parannich
With the thirst of filming God with the 7D
While I ask him to resign
Anger of centuries, unanswered questions
Because the silence is of the culprits
Of whom, of who, of those who have designed 'is a carousel
Of those who made us so weak
And I see blood on the ties
Of who has bet the country collapsed
And middle class without class
Who left it happened because she wanted to be part of it
If you don't know where you are going
Remember why you started
I don't become what I've always hated
I will remember why I do it
[Outro]
I remember you did it
Remind me because I do it
For what you did
Vendetta
I remember you did it
Remember me because I do it
For what you have done
Revenge, revenge, revenge
I am a leader, I'm not a boss (revenge, revenge)
I am a leader, I'm not a boss (revenge, revenge)
I am a leader, I'm not a boss (revenge, revenge)
Follow the leader (follow the leader)
Follow the leader (follow the leader) 19embed
