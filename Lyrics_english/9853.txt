Lyrics pump shack [intro]
(Six, cooking one more, ???????, 667)

[Verse 1 - Slimesuce]
This nego speaks a lot, but I don't touch me a finger
I shot this sucker and then ran out
I am the only one in my family that can be arrested
I carry two pistols, in my belt Smith & Wesson
He is the Sirigueijo, will become a mortadella
For this rat I play cheese, crack in my pan
With a TV on my back I jumped your window
I'm washing this money for me not to end up in the cell
Inside the bomb shack, he fell into the trap
Be careful where you step so that you don't lose your life
I shot in your groin, you fell like a young lady
I was carrying in the sink, you fell into the ambush
I was with people, in place the wrong time
If I don't have a weapon I will do you a stab
[Verse 2 - jotapills]
Every bar I do they say it was said
You're very exalted will clean your nose
I'm not an actor, but you act as an actress
I'm not a doctor, but you beg pill
I'm stoned of hi-tech and I mixed with triis
In my glass how many drugs, I think there was about six
I won't hit you again, you have become my customer
I talked to Dona Morte, and she loved you
Very punched in your face, in a minute more than ten
I'm running over so much, it looks like the S class
I kill any type, bro, you know I don't care
But in this type is that, my bro, like, I burn you alive
And my only rival indeed is the compressed
And if I don't drop three, I don't even feel like I'm alive

It is at dawn that the blood drips
I don't talk to the police, and I don't fuck with OPPs
It is at dawn that you discover, that your enemy is you
And you don't even know
