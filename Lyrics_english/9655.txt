Cassie (Wonâ€™t You Be My Doll) LyricsI went away
Yeah far away
I'm sorry that I never called
I miss your love
What can I say (ooh)
I'm just a man who never falls (ooh)

That's right
But Cassie won't you be my doll
But Cassie won't you be my doll
So what's the plan
You got a man
And I know you're probably movin' on
You take my hand
And understand
I was just afraid to fall in love (ooh)

That's right
But Cassie won't you be my doll
But Cassie won't you be my doll

Cassie won't you be my doll
Cassie won't you be my doll

That's right
But Cassie won't you be my doll
But Cassie won't you be my doll
But baby won't you be my doll
But baby won't you be my doll
But Cassie won't you be my doll
Cassie won't you be my dollYou might also likeEmbed
