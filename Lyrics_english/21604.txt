Easier Tonight LyricsSo the stage is set, the stars and moon above
I've come so far to get here, baby look at us
I am as nervous now as I was back then

Staring back at me in that white summer dress
The smell of jasmine takes me back to our first kiss
And I don't know where to start
But I'm leading with my heart

'Cause I've told you that I love you
From everything I've shown
And it's time to speak the truth
And finally let you know
Though I've always known
What to say every other time
I just wish that words came easier tonight
I haven't said I love you to any girl before
I'd say those words for something that meant more
So I promise when I do I will give my heart to you

'Cause I've told you that I love you
From everything I've shown
And it's time to speak the truth
And finally let you know
Though I've always known
What to say every other time
I just wish that words came easier

Tonight's the night I'm jumping in
It's why we started and it's how the story ends
I'm down on my knee and I'm asking for your hand
I'm asking for your hand

I just told you that I love you
Now everything has changed
What used to try and stop me
Just got pushed out of the way
And I always knew what to say
It just wasn't the right time
But it could have gone easier tonight
But it could have gone easier tonight
But it could have gone easier tonightYou might also likeEmbed
