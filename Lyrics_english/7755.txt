OK, Itâ€™s Alright With Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
OK, it's alright with me
Some things are just meant to be
It never comes easily
And when it does, I'm already gone
I'm practically never still
More likely to move until
I end up alone at will
My life continues inching along

[Chorus]
When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
She's much too sweet, and she's always gonna be
And when I return to her arms and her eyes
It might not be the same, but it's alright with me
[Verse 2]
OK, it's alright with me
(It's alright with me)
Some people are scared to see
(Are scared to see)
What's happening frequently
But I would never shy from a fight
Heartbeat with a high demand
(A high demand)
Often will go hand in hand
(Go hand in hand)
But I'm sick of just starting plans
I wanna spend the rest of my life

[Chorus]
When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
She's much too sweet, and she's always gonna be
And when I return to her arms and her eyes
It might not be the same, but it's alright with me
It's alright with me
It's alright with me
It's alright with me

[Refrain]
OK, it's alright with me, ooh
It's alright with me, ooh
It's alright with me
OK, it's alright with me
You might also like[Outro]
OK, it's alright with me
Some things are just meant to be
It never comes easily
And when it does, I'm already goneEmbed
