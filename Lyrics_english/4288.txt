Do what you want with me, take me to the forbidden
Approach, I want to feel your body

With your figure that catches me-Atrapa
With that 'curve' that kill me
A look that attacks me-Ataca
And a desire that betray me (OH-OH)

With that 'curve' that kill me
A look that attacks me-Ataca
And a desire that betray me (OH-OH)

With that mouth, Kiss me (EH)
With that body, Arropame
With your hands, feel me

With a little kiss, Mojame (EH)
With your waist I will
With that swing, stick me

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I bought you some victory, tell me if I mode them '(Huh!)
Another goal from Messi, you are my antonella (Yeah!)
If it's not with you, then, be with your twin (Yeah)
But I want a baby that is from Venezuela
Baby, I know I have a bad reputation (Yeah)
But the bad calls you (huh, huh)
You are the one you choose from: Cancun or the Bahamas (Wuh)
If you want France, then we end up in Punta Cana (RRRU)
Come and get donked
I am yours tonight, give me, kiss me (huh!)
No Aguantes wins them 'and touch me (rrru!)
I played your game and won it, Yeh (Wuh)
