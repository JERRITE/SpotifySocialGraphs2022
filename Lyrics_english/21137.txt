The Geeks Get the Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another Friday night, to get the feeling right
At the bar when he sees her comin' over
What you gonna do, if she walks up to you?
Tongue tied, better get yourself together
Pound another drink, to give him time to think
What's your sign? Hey, I think you know a friend of mine

All the stupid lines, that he had ever heard
Wouldn't come to mind, he couldn't say a word
[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

[Verse 2]
Got her holding steady, forgot her name already
Sweatin' hard, not a smooth operator
She's got it goin' on, dancing to her favorite song
He's got the line, is it your place or mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
She turns and walks away, where did he go wrong?
But waiting by the car, she says what took you so long

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

[Bridge]
The very next day, he guessed she ran away
The one and only in his bed so lonely
But she comes walkin' in, with coffee and a grin
Crazy as it seems, it wasn't just a dream
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And all around the world, people shouted out
The geeks got the girl

[Chorus 2]
Last night he finally got it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
Shout it all around the world 'cause the geeks get the girls
Last night he finally got it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
Shout it all around the world 'cause the geeks get the girls
Shout it all around the world 'cause the geeks get the girlsEmbed
