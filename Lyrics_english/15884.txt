Your worst mistake Lyrics ["Your worst mistake"]

[Intro]
Why did I fail if you never failed? (That's like that)
If you never left me (what knows')
When I fell, you got up (by law)
You kill them
And I don't know how to apologize (The Real Rondón)
If I hurt your heart (geniuz)
You always had the reason
[Chorus]
I am your worst mistake (Já-Já!), Hey
The cause 'e your pain (pa' that knows ', the cause' and your pain, baby)
Your only heartbreak (by law)
Please come back (for you, my wolf, please return, baby), ey
I am your worst mistake (that's how, that's how like that), he
The cause 'e your pain (pa' that knows ', the cause' and your pain, baby)
Your only heartbreak (by law)
(Are you understanding me what we are wanting to say?)
Please come back (The Real Rondón, please return, baby), ey
(The real return, he heard Baby?)
I'm your worst mistake

[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I asked your friend for you (that is like that)
He told me that you don't 'tá' me (pa 'know')
That it is very difficult for you to say yes (by law)
Because you found out that I gave another (ra-ta-ta-tá!)
There is a pair of panas, baby, who throw corn (Já!)
You know that is normal, because this is pa 'me (baby)
If you want, then continue around (Real G4 Life)
What if I see you, I will do as if I didn't see you

[Pre-stribe]
Now they just 'remain I remember'
And I get sad when I remember
When the 'lips bite you
And inside I dissolve it
With you, mommy, I wrap me
With you is that I develop
And I know that I miss myself

[Verse 2]
What do you want '? What will cry?
What to your home take Flore '?
What to do for you to come back 'and you fall in love'?
Although whenever I fix ', fight' for your reincore '
You say that I always make you get worse. '
But neither do you make na 'pa' that improves'
If you want, I don't call you until they heal the pain '
More can live people with neighbors more improve '

[Pre-stribe]
Now they just 'remain I remember'
And I get sad when I remember (Já-já!)

The cause 'e your pain (pa' what knows ', the cause' and your pain, baby), ey
Your only heartbreak
Please come back (that is, please, please, baby), ey (geniuz, geniuz)
I am your worst mistake (symphonic)
