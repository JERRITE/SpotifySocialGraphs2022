Machine Gun Man (Acoustic Version) Lyrics[Intro - Spoken]
Alright, we're rolling
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Tell me what a young man, Mama
What's he got to live for?
You've been tossed in the shuffle, child, of everyday war
Searching for some trouble, Lord
Which I'm sure he will find
Spend your whole life fighting, son
To meet your dying time
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, it's a shame
It's a shame, Lord
The trigger be his only friend
It's a shame, oh yeah
But it ain't, never gonna end, no

[Chorus]
He's a pocketful of hate, that don't give a damn
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
Well, he ain't got no future and he ain't got no plan
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
The machine gun man, yeah, step aside

[Verse 2]
I can't see tomorrow, Lord, I don't see today
A trail of confusion, Lord, mama's done leading my way
Say the only thing worth killing, Lord, be killing time
Only soul worth saving now, Mama, be saving mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, it's a shame
It's a shame, Lord
The trigger be his only friend
It's a shame, oh yeah
But it ain't, never gonna end, that's right
You might also like[Chorus]
Lord, he's a pocketful of hate, that don't give a damn
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
Well, he ain't got no future and he ain't got no plan
What fate awaits the machine gun man?

[Bridge]
He keeps shootin', Oh, Mama
Like any old fool would do
Lord, the life he be leading
Ain't the one he had to choose
As he walks on out that door
Mama breaks down to cry
Oh, as she waves, the machine gun man
Goodbye, goodbye, Lord, goodbye son

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, it's a shame
It's a shame, Lord
The trigger be his only friend
It's a shame, oh yeah
But it ain't, oh
Ain't never gonna end
[Chorus]
He's a pocketful of hate, that don't give a damn
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
Well, he ain't got no future, he ain't got no plan
What fate awaits the machine gun man?
The machine gun man
The machine, yeah, gun man
The machine gun man yeah
That's all folksEmbed
