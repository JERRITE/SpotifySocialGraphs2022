High to death LyricsI fell over
I fell onto the ground (Ooh)
I wish I was sober
I can't get up off the ground-round-round-round-round-ound-ound-round-round

When I closed my eyes
And I thought I was blind
It's the middle of the night
And I'll never be alright again

And this wallpaper
Keeps going 'round the room
It keeps going 'round the room
It keeps going 'round the room
And I follow it around the room
And I follow it around the room
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I still love you

But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

And I sat there on the steps
Considering death
There wеre only seconds left
Of thе night

And I said hell is the sun
Burning forever at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things...

And the sea isn't green
And I love this dream
But how can we exactly escape (I can’t turn this thing off, it keeps following me, used to be so human now it’s just a machine)
From behind the wall? (I can’t turn this thing off, it keeps following me, when’d you say you were leaving? When’d you really leave?)
You might also likeI can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it’s just a machine
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When’d you say you were leaving?
When’d you really leave?Embed
