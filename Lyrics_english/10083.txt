Lie About Us Lyrics[Avant]
Oehh oyy
Yeahh yeahh

[Avant - Verse 1]
Baby I know when we started out there were things you didn't know, but baby girl we got a lot of things we
Need to discuss I know I'm asking for a lot, but just trust. you say that things getting old sneakin'
Round creepin' and love on the low but baby girl I can't wait till' it's officially us, I can't wait to
Let them know about us
[Nicole]
First I thought that I could take you boy but I don't know, you told me you were gonna leave her for me
Long ago
[Avant]
Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow don't wanna break her heart, although I gotta let her go
So baby ..
[Avant - Hook]
So please don't say you wanna give up
How do I tell her that I'm falling in love
And I know your waiting patiently for that day
When we no longer have to lie about us
When I'm with her all I want is your touch
And when you call me I don't wanna hang up
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
Till' we no longer have to lie about us

[Avant - Verse 2]
Baby I know situation don't seem fair to us both
But baby girl, she's an issue that I'm bout to adjust
Don't mistake the love we make for just lust
You are my soul, mind, body, spirit all that I know
But baby girl I can't wait till' it's officially us, I can't
Wait to tell the world about us
[Nicole]
