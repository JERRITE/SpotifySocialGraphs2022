I Caught Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seemed to stop my breath
My head on your chest waiting to cave in
From the bottom of my...
Hear your voice again
Could we dim the sun and wonder where we've been?
Maybe you and me, so kiss me like you did
My heart stopped beating, such a softer sin

[Chorus]
I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now
[Verse 2]
Never caught my breath
Every second I'm without you, I'm a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
My cuts aren’t healing
Learning how to love

[Chorus]
I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now

[Verse 3]
You can stay and watch me fall
And of course I'll ask for help
Just stay with me now
We could take our heads off, stay in bed
Just make love, that's all
Just stay with me now

I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now
I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now

[Outro]
In your eyes
Let’s sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes4Embed
