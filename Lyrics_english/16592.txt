Outstanding Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, man you know what I'm sayin'
Makers
Young Gunna, Gunna, you know what I'm sayin', yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
When I made my first million (Million)
I ain't panic (I ain't panic)
I only drank out the seal
Now I'm done with Xannies (Done with Xannies)
I bought my mama a crib, I'm outstanding (I'm outstanding)
I'm pressin' my cousin appeal (Appeal)
'Til it's granted ('Til it's granted)
I bought her Sheneneh heels, I'm a Chanel bandit (Chanel bandit)
I still got vintage garments old as my granny (Old as my granny)
Got my interior almond and outside candy (And outside candy)
I put your bitch in Balmain because she pretty (Because she pretty)
[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey, freaky, I'm fuckin' her face (In her face)
Her ass is not comin' to waste (Comin' to waste)
I'm not patient, I don't wanna wait (Don't wanna wait)
I eat goat, and I am what I ate (What I ate)
I fill up a Backwood with a eighth (A eighth)
Ain't no shame that I hang with some snakes (Hang with some snakes)
Hey, hey, cashed out on a foreign today (Foreign today)
I hop in that 'Rari and race ('Rari and race)
I never get tired of the hate (Naw)
Climb up to the top like a gate (Yah)
You lil' niggas copy and paste (Copy and paste)
Got gold like a bottle of Ace (of Ace)
A Coke Cola bottle her shape (A Coke Cola bottle)
Hey, I had a ball today (A ball today)
She drinkin' Chardonnay (Chardonnay)
Went to court and didn't have to debate (Debate)
Jewish lawyer that handle the case (Handle the case)
The codeine got a hell of a taste (A hell of a taste)
Put the penthouse in all of your states (All of your states)
Stack that money, that's all I can say

[Chorus]
When I made my first million (Million)
I ain't panic (I ain't panic)
I only drank out the seal
Now I'm done with Xannies (Done with Xannies)
I bought my mama a crib, I'm outstanding (I'm outstanding)
I'm pressin' my cousin appeal (Appeal)
'Til it's granted ('Til it's granted)
I bought her Sheneneh heels, I'm a Chanel bandit (Chanel bandit)
I still got vintage garments old as my granny (Old as my granny)
Got my interior almond and outside candy (And outside candy)

Knock some fours on that cat like a donk
Fly the jet in the sky like a hawk (Like a hawk)
I geek up and I get in the zone (Geek up)
I put all them racks in a vault (In a vault)
Hey, hey, we rich and above the law (Above the law)
I made my brother a boss (Brother a boss)
And she keep that dick in her jaw (In her jaw)
Keep receipts to the shit that I bought (I bought)
Cuban link to my wrist when I floss (Floss)
Carats stuck in my teeth when I talk (Yeah)
You gon' notice the C's when I walk (The C's when I walk)
Hey, this a pent, it is not a loft (Not a loft)
We got the Jeep, that is not a Trackhawk
If I put on white, then it's gotta be Off (Gotta be Off)
She don't say a word, but her body can talk
Sexy girl turnin' me on
You wanna know what that Cartier cost? (Cost)
Put a Rolex on her arm
