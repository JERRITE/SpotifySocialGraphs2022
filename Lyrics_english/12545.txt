Half Mast Lyrics4 years old
I was in a playground digging for bones
Underneath the wood chips
Under the stones
Searching for the dead and gone
Dinosaurs with their dead end songs
And then

When I was 7
I planted 20 peach pits in the backyard
One of them grew up to be a tree with 50 arms
It bore the sweetest fruit I've ever tasted
And the roots tore through the dirt
Tore through the pavement
All these animals
With their paws in traps
All the animals
In this bar make me laugh
It's the way that our faces sink at half mast
It's the way that our bodies stink (make noise)

I already know them by heart
I've memorized their reflections
And know the art
I've felt the rush of a big bet
And got the scars
Covering each bit of this chest
We'll play our parts
But every performance will end

So if this is really the start of the finish
I guess I gotta go ahead and settle for chipping away at the infinite...
Only felt alive for a minute's time...
All I ever wanted was to be significant - not losing in my prime
Sacrificing my body pocket and mind
For a taste of it
Spitting in the face of it
They love it when a man plummets
I'd pray but I can't stomach that rubbish
You might also likeWhere do they really want to go when they die?
In the clouds with the most high?
Underground or the sky with a clown-like "BIG GUY"?
In a wooden box
With a suit and tie
So the boll weevils can hide
With some maggots in between toenails
While arachnids swim inside bone marrow?
Or would they prefer to go sterile?

God Dammit

I'm locked inside this unforgiving planet
Where people chant of freedom and revolution
But have never had it
So I've been on a quest to find a way out of inevitable gravity and death
And I'm at a turning point
Wondering if I should quit now
But it's all in jest

I feel I'm dick deep
And the writer's block raping my brain
Is editing out all the ways I want to say "fuck you" in good taste

This is an album
About low living
Sucking up dust and discovering quickly
That the truth is unforgiving
All these animals
With their paws in traps
All the animals
In this bar make me laugh
It's the way that our faces sink at half mast
It's the way that our bodies stink

9 years old
Saw a man get shot in the road:
Robbed a bank
Never made it home
That's my fucking hero though
A gambler with no soul
Took a risk
Buried in a hole
When I was 12
I dreamt Abuelo never went to hell
I dreamt he never shot and killed himself
In that Puerto Rican motel
Where the cane rum sunk into the shelves
I painted him in heaven
17
I made believe my father kept clean
That addiction wasn't built inside of me
Or David
But the tree is still growing
And it seems
That the fruit it bore 10 years before just wasn't so sweet

I must say
I must say
I never thought you would fade

Julius
I must say
I must say
I never thought you would

Julius
I must say
I must say
I never thought you would fade

Julius
I must say
I must say
I must say
I must say...

All these animals
With their paws in traps
All the animals
In this bar make me laugh
It's the way we're all sinking at half mast
