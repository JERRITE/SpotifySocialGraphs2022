Hometown Heroes Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah we go way back where we started from
We were hometown heroes high enough for everyone
Yeah we go way back where we started from
Oh we used to say it's one for and all for -

[Verse 1]
One by one, they went their ways
Some stay close and others fade away
These memories aren't what they seem
The house I knew, was it all a dream?
[Chorus]
Yeah we go way back where we started from
We were hometown heroes high enough for everyone
Yeah we go way back where we started from
Oh we used to say it's one for and all for one
One for and all for -

[Verse 2]
Once I knew life moves too fast
Take a million pictures, live inside the photographs
'Cause colors stay, but we have changed
And when our hearts are heavy, know I love you all the same

[Chorus]
Yeah we go way back where we started from
We were hometown heroes high enough for everyone
Yeah we go way back where we started from
Oh we used to say it's one for and all for one
One for and all for -

[Bridge]
'Cause it was beautiful, we were beautiful
Once upon a time
And now we're in the wild
Am I still the child I used to be?
Oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah we go way back where we started from
We were hometown heroes high enough for everyone
Yeah we go way back where we started from
Oh we used to say it's one for and all for one
All for one
One for and all for oneEmbed
