[Verse 1: Yung L.A.]
You got to know the boy futuristic, ain't he? (Ain't he?)
My work can make the J's do the jumpman, can't it? (Can't it?)
You got to know this the remix right here (Bow!)
Grand Hustle, baby, it's the kings right here (Bow!)
You got to know we guapin' (Guap), pockets extra sloppy (What?)
Don't I love my vegetables? Extra cheese and broccoli (What?)
Don't Yung LA like to kick it like karate? (Karate!)
Don't I be with J-Money serving everybody? (Trap!)
Ain't we up in Magic City throwing up the profit? (Throw it up!)
Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket? (We taking off!)
Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, money long?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I still putting on? (Bow!)

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Okay, my rims so big; I'm at the tip-top, ain't I? (Ain't I?)
Choppers in the trunk'll make you do the "Macarena" ('Rena)
Polo to the floor, yeah, motherfucker, ain't I? (Ain't I?)
All-black coupe, I can buy it, bitch, can't I? (Can't I?)

Dro be on that thing, you don't hear me, trick, ain't I? (Ain't I?)
Big Rolls Royces (Royces), and I got 'em nauseous (Nauseous)
We be in Ferraris, the cars with the horses (Brrrr!)
Ain't I on a pill? (Yuh!) Riding down Dill
Ice, 30 below, minus the wind chill (Ugh!)
Ain't I packing chrome? (Chrome) And I'm blowing strong (Yeah)
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on? Young Dro!

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ralph Lauren, Purple Label; ain't I fresh as I can be?
Made it through my situation; ain't I blessed as I can be?
Ain't I laughing at you haters tryna take a shot at me?
They don't know which way to go—I'll make it easy: Follow me
Honestly, ain't I insane? I think that's the way I gotta be
Ain't I so, so superfly? Boy, ain't nobody hot as me
Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep? (Ain't he?)
Everywhere, they notice me—ayy, for yourself, just go and see
My community, I'm serving, though they hope I don't succeed
Hear me speak, they so intrigued—"Ayy, ain't he snitching?" No, indeed
You come with that common flow (Well), your show, I have to commandeer
Since I see you can't take over, I'll just have to volunteer (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, ain't I your superior? Listen here, bruh: you not a peer
I'm so Zone 1 that it ain't funny, twice the G that I appear (Hahaha)
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear (Bankhead!), gon' be gone for 'bout a year
So Paper Trail, you gotta hear, but ain't that "Ain't I" outta here? Ayy!
