(Thereâ€™s Gotta Be) More to Life Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go?

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more
Than wanting more
[Verse 2]
I've got the time, and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment, I'm halfway out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure

[Bridge]
There's gotta be more
I'm wanting more (Oh yeah)
I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feeling like there's something I missed?
(Something I missed, yeah)

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm (More that I'm)
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure (Oh yeah)
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high (Oh yeah)
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm
Trippin', I'm thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, it's life, but I'm sure
