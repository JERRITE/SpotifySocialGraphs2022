COULD HAVE BEEN YOU Lyrics[Verse 1]
L.A. fucking changed you
You were a different person all of a sudden
But honestly I've changed too
I guess I'm not the type that you wanted

'Cause my love didn't phase you
I bought you Gucci before I could afford it
Would have given up the world to you
But then I never heard from you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
One day you'll come running back, back, back
Oh-oh-oh-oh
But it'll be too late for that

[Chorus]
I'm doing what we dreamed of
With somebody new
Going to the places
That you wanted to
It could have been you
It could have been you

I bet you see the pictures
Pop up on your phone
I know that it kills you
That I'm not alone
That could have been you
That could have been you

It could have been
You
It could have been
You
It could have been
You
You might also like[Verse 2]
But L.A. fucking changed me
And trust me when I say for the better
I moved on 'cause you made me (made me)
Now my cologne's on a new girl's sweater

And she's fucking amazing
I knew it from the moment I met her
And imma give the world to her
And give her what you don't deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
One day you'll come running back, back, back
Oh-oh-oh-oh
But it'll be too late for that

[Chorus]
I'm doing what we've dreamed of
With somebody new
Going to the places
That you wanted to
It could have been you
It could have been you

I bet you see the pictures
Popped up on your phone
I know that it kills you
That I'm not alone
That could have been you
That could have been you
It could have been
You
That coulve have been
You
It could have been

[Chorus]
I'm doing what we've dreamed of
With somebody new
Going to the places
That you wanted to
It could have been you
It could have been you

I bet you see the pictures
Popped up on your phone
I know that it kills you
That I'm not alone
That could have been you
That could have been you

[Outro]
It should've been youEmbed
