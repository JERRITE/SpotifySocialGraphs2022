Say Hello to Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey there, stranger
How you been?
Feels like I'm standing on the outside looking in
At the mess we left behind
And it's a long way to fall
I gave you everything I had, I gave it all
And then my heart was on the line

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't hate you any longer
I know I'm gonna miss you
I'll forget it and let it go
[Chorus]
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause it's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not gonna lie to you
'Cause that was there and only then
Say hello to goodbye
Say hello...

[Verse 2]
And this is how it has to be
'Cause it's a deadly combination, you and me
You know it's undeniable, even though we tried it all
We brought the worst out in each other, I recall
We can't act it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
What doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger
And though I'm gonna miss you
I'll forget it and let you go

[Chorus]
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause it's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not gonna lie to you
'Cause that was there and only then
Say hello to goodbye
Say hello...

And even though the tears will dry
I can't completely disconnect
Couldn't make the compromise
We didn't have a safety net

[Chorus]
Say hello to goodbye
Hey, yeah, yeah
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello to goodbye
It's gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I'll survive without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not gonna lie to you
'Cause that was there and only then

[Outro]
Say hello to goodbye
Say hello to goodbye
Say hello, hello
To goodbyeEmbed
