506 Lyrics [letter from "506"]

[Verse 1]
Your number on paper
Memories of a song
Afternoons trying to watch television
First feel the skin
And then the heart feels
Going back to your street makes me see that

[Pre-car]
I remember because I fell in love
I remember what I love you
But I'm calling because I'm dying to know
[Chorus]
How do you? I don't know why but I got in both
Moria desire to listen to your voice
It feels the same, nothing change (oooh)
How are you? You still live in 506
Where we leave the first love
With 16, every change (oooh)
I remember because I fell in love
I remember what I love you
But you answered and I already forgot because, it ended

[Post-car]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over

[Verse 2]
Yesterday we played hidden with other intentions
Today I find you hidden in more than 15 songs
And I'm going to do (what), if I can't see you (no)
It's just normal to make me want to know

[Pre-car]
Are you still going to Cartagena on vacation? If you are still afraid of airplanes
And what am I going to do (what), if I can't see you (no) it is barely normal to make me want to know

How are you? (How are you)
I don't know why but I thought about both (I)
Moria desire to listen to your voice
It feels the same, nothing changed (nothing)
How are you? (How are you)
You still live in 506
Where we leave the first love
With 16 every change (oh oh ooo)
I remember because I fell in love
I remember what you fell in love (OH)
But you answered and I already forgot because, it ended

[Post-car]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh ob oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over (oooo)
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
It ended
