Light without gravity lyrics ["Light without gravity"]

[Verse 1]
Alone remembering
While the latter are happening
I don't know how I can forget you
The rain falls into the window
Drawing your gaze
A moment is an eternity

[Pre-Car 1]
I'm tired of dreaming, without you
Confuse reality
[Chorus]
And I don't know if you'll return
To love and wait
Without asking me anything else
If it could be true
There would be no darkness

[See 2]
In each story there is an end
In every love there is heartbreak
In each meeting
There is an illusion

[Pre-Coro 2]
We are so many people
Alone and different
Loving is going with you until I die

[Chorus]
And I don't know if you'll return
To love and wait
Without asking me anything else
If it could be true
There would be no darkness

[Chorus]
And I don't know if you'll return
To love and wait
Without asking me anything else
If it could be true
There would be no darkness
Only light without gravity
If it could be true
There would be no darkness
There would be no darkness

While the latter
They are going through
