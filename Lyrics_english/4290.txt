[Chorus: Yandel]
Explain what you feel when you're naked (Woh, Oh, Oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart '(Yeah, EH)
The bed begins and will be naked (Oh; Oh)
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
Explain what you feel when you're naked
Tell him only with me the naked heart '
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
[Verse 1: bad bunny]
(YEH-YEH-YEH-YEH)
I'm not Carlos Vives (Wuh)
But I want you to get rid of my bicycle
He gives him the turn to the planet
Tell me what country wants' to put it in (yih)
Explain that with me you feel complete (Yeah!)
That I do come to you until the totito squeezes you (Yeh-Yeh)
Tell him that it is over (Yeah)
That my name on your skin was recorded (recorded)
That now you are with the bo '(oh)
That the vo '(oh) does not rise
Yesterday newspaper, as Lavoe (Lavoe) said
Tell him that it was I who entered for your room and stole you (rrr!), Yeah
Explain to him, you like how I do it (wuh)
Go and tell me that with me in the movie to 'payment (wuh)
That you are not a woman to be unfaithful (no)
But that you got tired and you don't want to

[Chorus: Yandel & Bad Bunny, both]
Explain what you feel when you're naked (huh, eh; oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart '
The bed starts lying and will be naked (Yeah; EH)
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
Explain what you feel when you're naked (Oh, Oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart '(huh, eh)
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you

And that moment when I (EH)
I make everything forget (OH)
And it is that you feel like time stop
Tell him you lie when you're without clothes
Tell what I make you feel

And that with me you go crazy
Cannot 'resist
It will be repeated again
Explain to him that in bed the intimate is not the same
Trust him, you changed your way of thinking

[Chorus: Yandel & Bad Bunny, both]
Explain what you feel when you're naked (huh, eh; oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart '
The bed begins and will be naked (Yeah)

Explain what you feel when you're naked (Oh, Oh)
Tell him only with me the naked heart '(huh, eh)
The bed starts lying and will be naked
How your legs tremble and how the body sweats you
