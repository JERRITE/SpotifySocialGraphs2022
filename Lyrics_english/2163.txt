Disgusting Lyrics [Text of "Disgusting" Ft. Gue Pequeno]

[Refrain: hernia]
I do the fuck I want (Q-Q-Q-Q-Q) (UH)
Sorry, fool, you're disgusting (uh, yah)
Sorry, Fool, You're disgusting (Q-Q-Q)
Yeah, Sorry, Fool, You're disgusting (uh)
I do the cock I want (ah)

[Verse 1: hernia]
Reading your text is like reading Lercio
I change a flow by piece, I'm the new Guercio
'Sta tipa is a toilet that looks like a picasso
I try the same, I have no eyes on the cock
So ignorant inside a piece
Instead so acculturated inside the one after
This is the main reason
So you can slap this telescope in your throat
Italian rap knows of sub -sauce
A harem in the room, I'm Umberto Smaila
I'm fresh, you know, come on, what do you know, Fra '?
Exclusive Tidal, Tu Temptation Island
Bottom and you no, on the street they call me "el verdugo"
If you tend, do not make that face, come on, Bro
Cry in the corner, walter nude
[Refrain: hernia]
I have more pussy than flow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sorry, fool, you're disgusting (uh)
Ah, sorry, fool, you're disgusting (brr, yah)
You Look Sick, Why you couaught? (Uh)
I have more pussy than flow (yah)

[Verse 2: Ernia & Guè Pequeno]
Friar ', do you have the brain but what for?
Royal deer, uncle, watford
Top of the range, Uncle, Blancos
In the street I am Negro Blanco
Defintely, get me into the game
It was like opening the door to the gypsies
Worse, zì, I do not conquer, friar ', I looted, yes, basicerly
Sorry, dance "Despacito", watch the TV, swallow with the funnel
After on the top YouTube the topics inside all the pieces, you are a stoned
Come on, don't be tough, you are pussy (yeah)
I write on the walls "Er Nyah Vive" (Yeah)
I want the holidays in Tel-Aviv and (Yeah)
Tatuo on the back Athena Nike (G-G-G-G-U-è)

[Verse 3: Guè Pequeno]
Bitch, 'I'm the fuck is royal
For this I wash my hands before pissing (ah)
Drink tsingtao
My giant fazza on the walls (Yeah), Zedong Mao (Okay)
Okay, puta muta, all a moina
You want the small coca, mhm, cocaine
Maladine life, fairy rifle
Her tight pussy, Mhm, Mandarina
She has such a ass so outside (out)
That I support the glass above (ah)
And to do 'this jacket I wear (seh)
They shake thirty -six cobra (ah)
Command still 'I'm sound (Seh)
But I still dress for a man (ah-ah)
True Motherfucker, son, learn the bon ton
I leave the mark with 'Ste Cinchate, Vuitton
