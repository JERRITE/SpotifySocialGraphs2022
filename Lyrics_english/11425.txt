Lazy Days Lyrics[Chorus: Cisco]
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, its the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Well I was walking through MacArthur park
Looking for some sugar just to cure my heart
And after dark I talk to the cabbie
Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy
And it's alright
Just as long as I can get high, sit back and watch the sunset in the sky
I don't know if you know what I mean
But it's love in Los Angeles
[Chorus: Cisco]
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Walking through Malibu not a thing to do
Gotta find a fine young little girl to screw, over
I never meant to block your sunshine
I never meant to block your sunshine
I never meant to block your sun
I don't know if you know what I mean
But it's love in Los Angeles

[Chorus: Cisco]
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

[Bridge: Cisco & Shwayze]
Now everybody clap your hands
We gonna do the dirty dance
Now everybody stomp your feet
To the beat

We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

I don't know if you know what I mean
But it's love in Los Angeles

[Chorus: Cisco]
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
