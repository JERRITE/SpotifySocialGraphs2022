A call lyrics ["a call" letter "]

[Intro]
I, ma!
This new ringtone arrives that I brought you
Broke and Famous
'Perando that I give me a call
For you to spend your friend 'by Bluetooth
Nena, can you call me?
What I call you? Why?
Ah, what calls received free na 'more'?
Unlimited night, after seven are you going to call me?
Well, I'm going to wait for the call
[Chorus]
Waiting for me to give me a call
Waiting for me to give me a call
I need your heat
I don't know if you are called love
But progress and call, please
Waiting for me to give me a call
Waiting for me to give me a call
I need your heat
I don't know if you are called love
But progress and call

[Verse 1]
Waiting for me to give me a call to give you love
A return along the coast, there will be label to the rock '
Octopus, caviche and lobster, put some short '
I don't know if they are Lacoste, he says that the cut does not care
What wants is to hesitate because life is very short
Some give on the old road in Guayanilla
To eat empanadillas, give us rake without going to miles
Make fresh 'inside the car on the beach, parking on the shore
Stop in Ponce to visit the family
In the Plaza a Vanilla Hela'o in boat
On the way to 'Carolina a little and seedless
Green Island, Ocean Park
Give us a couple of kisses feeling the sea breeze
And if you need someone who knows you to love
You have my phone, you know where to call
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Waiting for me to give me a call
Waiting for me to give me a call
I need your heat
I don't know if you are called love
But progress and call, please
Waiting for me to give me a call
Waiting for me to give me a call
I need your heat
I don't know if you are called love
But progress and call

[Verse 2]
And if you are Town ', ma, give yourself a couple of drink' na 'ma'
So that you see how to hesitate 'to early'
We were 'pa' house, pledge 'the air
And we get up 'at four' and the afternoon
To breakfast, for the service car
If you don't want to leave, you can stay
I don't know if I can love you, but you can try
What bad can happen? What's wrong with us?
Something to smoke, mommy, that and 'natural
And if we lived in Jamaica it were legal
And bad for asking
But what do you have there, do you think about me?
[Bridge]
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Give it, tell me if it gives it to me '
I don't want almost na '
But among the things I want
I want what you have there. '
I don't want almost na '
But among the things I want
I want what you have there. '
I don't want almost na '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Give it, tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Give it, tell me if it gives it to me '

[Outro]
Tell me if it gives it to me '
Broke and Famous
Not the broke at all
787 without contract
With Tainy
Killing them without a gun
