I am to fly lyrics ["I am flying" letter]]

[Verse 1: Andrés Ceballos]
You know, I've always had a brave
And now I dare or look at you
What is happening to me? What will you have?

[Verse 2: Lali]
Tell me, we don't know who will fall first
Each endures in their field
But soon you're going to move with me (huh)
[Pre-Caro: Andrés Ceballos & Lali]
And even crazy
This is taking height and I am flying
And even if we are so up
That the fall is afraid

[Choir: Andrés Ceballos & Lali]
I know you feel that this is not by chance
And here you are (now)
And that face
That no matter how much I don't know how to hide the truth
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Andrés Ceballos, Lali, both]
Alone (alone) I piеrdo if I have given you loss
I have infected without measure
Relive if you stay with me
I do the simple thing I make it complicated
But with you love, what do I know
I don't think about it (Yeah)
You stay by my side, oh-oh

[Pre-Caro: Andrés Ceballos & Lali]
And even crazy
This is taking height and I am flying
And even if we are so up
That the fall is afraid

I know you feel that this is not by chance (EH)
And here you are (and here you are)
And that face
That no matter how much he does not know how to hide the truth (the truth)
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "No", Baby, no, Baby

[Bridge: Andrés Ceballos & Lali]
Let's not lose madness
From the heights you know that I am flying
And even if we are so up
What about the fall

[Chorus: both, Andrés Ceballos, Lali]
I know you feel that this is not by chance
And here you are (and here you are)
And that face
That no matter how much he does not know how to hide (eh) the truth
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no (ah-ah)
Don't say "no", baby, no, baby, no, no, no1embed
