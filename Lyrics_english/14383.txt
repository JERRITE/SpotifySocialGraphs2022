Worried About Ray Lyrics[Verse 1]
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm worried what the future holds, the future holds
I'm starting to worry about Ray
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm worried what the future holds, the future holds
I'm seriously worried about Ray

[Chorus]
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
[Verse 2]
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm treading on my tippy toes, my tippy toes
I'm starting to worry about Ray
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm treading on my tippy toes, my tippy toes
I'm painfully so worried about Ray

[Chorus]
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall, no

[Bridge]
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
And they say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
The future's out to get you, the future's out to get you all
The future's out to get you, the future's out to get you all

[Outro]
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm worried what the future holds, the future holds
I'm so tired of being worried about RayYou might also like2Embed
