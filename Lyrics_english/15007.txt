X-Ray Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do the laughs die when
One such as I run
And allow myself
Time for own true need
When convincing me
That you're on my team
May not lie to me
But not mentioning

[Instrumental Solo]
[Verse 2]
So sit back and have
An hysterical laugh at tiny holes
Buy and trade men's souls

[Chorus]
X-ray mind reads plenty
Worth no more than pennies

[Verse 3]
You, they, it or what
Have been fair, I thought
May you never free
You from you or me
See the more I think
I'm afraid to blink
I don't move an inch
Slowly draining me

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 4]
Hire a spy and bug me
Pimp your friends for money
Rich and growing sicker
Sell the dead ones quickerYou might also like1Embed
