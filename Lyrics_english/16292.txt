Iâ€™ll Be Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm only a man, judgments of something ancient
Clockin' my time as finished the same is all replacements
Ignorance is complacency, why I am purposely faded?
No stand, no sit, no stoppin', rippin' through the neon prophecies
Got let off by a ticket stub, my time is fading fast
Through your mouth and out your

[Chorus]
(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) Come down
(You oughta wash your hands and pray) For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood) Pass it 'round
(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) For now
(You promise that you'll come around?) I'll be around
[Verse 2]
So I fear, but I don't know what it is
So I want, but I pretend I don't need
So here's the pain of the stop of a lover's kiss
I throw my pages all away like shaking wrists
So shake me down
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
So shake me up

[Chorus]
(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) Hey now
(You oughta wash your hands and pray) For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood) Pass it 'round
(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) Come down
(You promise that you'll come around?) I'll be around

[Verse 3]
I tell me it ain't hard as I hold my breath thinkin' why
Tell me to my beating heart that I know for sure
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
Better than I can know for sure
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
What is real
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
My mistakes bend like payphone metal
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
I never know just what will come
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
As our [?] hands bind together
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
River and me children
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
Longer than a trillion
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
Get what I am given, forever
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)
(So shake me up)

(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) Come down
(You oughta wash your hands and pray) For what?
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood) Pass it 'round
(You never do what you say) Say what?
(Shine 'til the sun comes up) For now
(You promise that you'll come around?)2Embed
