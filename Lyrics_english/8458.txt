Dominican Lyrics [Dominican letter "]

[Intro]
Nenin, I will not give you a lot of lu ', you know ’what to do with this' woman'
Let it go

[Chorus]
I walk with a bad of the 'mine (uh)
A skylight, but it is given in fine (krrt)
Ha, the one who bursts the horn arrived
It causes the tiguere 'when it crosses the corner (zoom!)
She, she is seen (she is seen), that 'tá crazy that this fat
He has a spot, he eats culalei
Natural or done, I don't have to do (KRRT)
[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Hey, Já
Lover money (UH), she wants Paca
I put that if it gives me the sheet
A chamaquito de la Vega, crosses you and the mask '
Rouleta in the suburban, pa 'Santiago with Do' Flaca '
She moves heavy, throws himself on the floor
Not e 'the one that has, and' the one who knows how to move it
The 'do' are twin ', the' halo for the hair
When Gigi's batting, the yellow effect (UH)
She wants more ', but she has to move it
That damn throws it to the ground
I am his why I don't give him zeal
That pinga and 'chapota, you have to see it
No e 'de mouth, and what does it have to do it
You have to grab it, suck it and bite it
Bitch

Hey, ha
She and 'crazy with the Gordo de la Sie7et3 (UH)
'Tá clear that I put it as e'
Turning on the yacht, patron with the Moët
I don't think about it, contempt at once (zoom, zoom)
From Miami Fenamo 'ugo pa' lo 'mine
From 'Mina Pa' La Vega, Fronteamo 'on the corner (Krrt)
As the alpha says, mommy, I put it fine
Upload volume, which explodes the 'horn'
I contempt, I walk with your shorty and you already in four (hey)
I give him with the evil that Fidel Castro has
Close the curtain that the theater is over
I break it with the bat of the Astros team

[Chorus]
I walk with a bad of the 'mine (uh)
A skylight, but it is given in fine
Ha, the one who bursts the horn arrived
It causes the tiguere 'when it crosses the corner (zoom!)
She, she is seen (she is seen), that 'tá crazy that this fat
He has a spot, he eats culalei
Natural or done, I don't have to do (KRRT)
