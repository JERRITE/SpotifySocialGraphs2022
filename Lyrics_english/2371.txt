Never Let Go LyricsXaxanity:

And she got me hooked
Like the drugs on my bed
She wanna play my heart
Leave me for dead
And im so cold
Kiss me with eyes closed
Never let go
And never let go
And never let go~
Go go go

Lost in the abyss
Ya god i feel like shit
I just really need you here
Baby I dont wanna go oh

Clenching up my fist
Baby imma throw a fit
Clenching up my fist
Baby imma throw a fit-t-t

Glowboy:
Baby hold both of my hands
Ur the only one i see in the crowd
Ur my fav number 1 fan
I feel so sad when ur not around
Walk me like a puffle
U know im just trouble
Do u wanna cuddle
Or baby i could go
I just wanna diе and cry
Its fine but like
Im stuck living in the limеlight

Xaxanity:
And she got me hooked
Like the drugs on my bed
She wanna play my heart
Leave me for dead
And im so cold
Kiss me with eyes closed
N Never let go
And never let go
And never let go~

Stuck inside a trap and i can't escape
Voices in my head and they say ur name

Im addicted to ur luv and the drugs ok
