I miss you, I forget you, I love you Lyrics [lyrics of "I miss you, I forget you, I love you"]

[Verse]
I bring so much loneliness in pockets
Since you left I don't have more
That a gray photo and a sad feeling
What hurts most is so confusion
In each Back of my heart
How to go to the side of my thoughts

[Pre-car]
For you, for you, for you
I have left everything without looking back
I bet on life and let myself win
[Chorus]
I miss you, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again

I miss you, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again
No, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
I have lost everything, even identity
And if you asked for more, I could give
Is that when you love anything it is too much
You taught me the limit of passion
And you didn't teach me to say goodbye
I have learned now that you have left

[Pre-car]
For you, for you, for you
I have left everything without looking back
I bet on life and let myself win

[Chorus]
I miss you, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again
You Might Also Likete Strange, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again

I miss you

I miss you, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again

I miss you, because your memory lives in me
I forget you, at every minute I try
I love you, I have no remedy
I miss you, I forget you and I love you again

I love you
