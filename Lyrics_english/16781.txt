One Night in Heaven LyricsI'd like to say that I'm sorry
I'd like to see you smile
I don't want you to worry
I'd like to see you smile
Do you still believe me?
Ooh. Still figuring your life?
Is your heart still beating
Like it did the very first time?
One night in heaven
No matter what you say, baby
One night in heaven
Don't let it slip away
You say: "I'm wasting time
But that don't worry me
Because I know that I'll
Get you eventually."
One night in heaven
I fell in love with you, baby
All this time I've been waiting
About to lose my mind
What's the game that you're playing
Don't want to lose my mind
Are you trying to hurt me?
Are you putting me down?
Is it love you're after?
Or are you fooling around?
One night in heaven
No matter what you say, baby
One night in heaven
Don't let it slip away
You say: "I'm wasting time
But that don't worry me
Because I know that I'll
Get you eventually."
One night in heaven
One night in heaven
One night in heaven
No matter what you say, baby
One night in heaven
Don't let it slip away
You say: "I'm wasting time
But that don't worry me
Because I know that I'll
Get you eventually."
One night in heaven
One night in heaven
I fell in love with you, baby
You say: "I'm wasting time
But that don't worry me
Because I know that I'll
Get you eventually."
