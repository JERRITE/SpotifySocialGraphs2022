Who Raised You? Lyrics[Verse 1: JL]
New day, same boss
Airport, take off
Gang gang, swank sauce
Still beat your motherfucking brakes off
Ear for, ratchet, when I think of me being that kid
Posted up, nobody posting up what we had did
On the porch with bangers with torches, ain't gotta dab rig
Doing the most is what I could do at least
Moving like I decided not to renew a lease
Picture me rolling view at laguna beach
Puffing a Cuban, giving someone the Big Kahuna speech
Holding my crotch 'cause of how hard it was
Hood that we was in, none of us had a car garage
And a mirage, did not realize it was sabotage
Believe in boogieman but knew mama was Santa Claus
We don't know all the commandments
But we memorized rap catalogs
We know Biggie Smalls crack list
Savages, catalyst, ain't that a bitch
[Hook: Suli4Q]
My Kush get work by skit school
Graduated to the penthouse with the sick view
Gotta play the game or it plays you
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?
Who? who raised you?
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?
Who? who raised you?
They don't make 'em like this
My cut skin work by skit school
Graduated to the penthouse with the sick view
Gotta play the game or it plays you
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?

[Verse 2: JL]
Ayy bro, let's pray, don't stress
Stay low, press they flow
Just a process, play more chess
Peso checks, bankroll fresh
If you don't hear me, then this mic will
Made it and afraid to be clearly living to die real
Sit in cells, may never know how a flight feel
On a red-eye heated, some nigga got on his light still
Just another day in a rapper's life
Fakes ruin vibes, dreams ruin my nap at night
The brakes ruin the ride, the snakes ruin the fruit
But nothing ruin my appetite
I don't hear me and anyone rap alike
Bouncing like signals off of a satellite
Wouldn't be this high if I was scared of heights
I want the paper not after bragging rights
Throw snake eyes with a pair of dice— twice
Turning this paradox into paradise
Wanna put us in a box then of course
Fuck a box, jail, casket, or pandoras
Bitch

Gotta play the game or it plays you
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?
Who? who raised you?
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?
Who? who raised you?
They don't make 'em like this
My cut skin work by skit school
Graduated to the penthouse with the sick view
Gotta play the game or it plays you
They don't make 'em like this, who raised you?Embed
