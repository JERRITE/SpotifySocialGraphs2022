Half Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
It makes me feel nervous
You have that look in your eye
Oh, what takes over?
What is it that holds you tight?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can tear it up
Oh, no one tears it up like you
Oh, you can rip it up
Oh, no one rips it up like you
[Chorus]
When you're in the half-light
It is not you I see
And you live a half-life
You only show half to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I join you
Let you wash over me
And we're in the darkness
Only the blind can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can tear it up
Oh, no one tears it up like you
Oh, you can rip it up
Oh, I can rip it up like you

[Chorus]
When you're in the half-light
Oh, it is not you I see
And you live a half-life
You only show half to me
And can you shake it off?
Or can you shake it off for me?
When you're in the half-light
I don't like the half I see
You might also like[Bridge]
What possesses you?
Oh, what possesses you?
Oh, what possesses you?
Oh, what possesses you?

[Chorus]
When you're in the half-light
Well, it's not you I see
And you live a half-life
You only show half to me
And can you shake it off?
Oh, can you shake it off for me?
When you're in the half-light
I don't like the half I see, no
Oh, oh, oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh13Embed
