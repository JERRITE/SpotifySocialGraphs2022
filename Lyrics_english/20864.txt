State of the Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know your name
I told you mine
We've stopped and passed the time of day

[Verse 2]
You work in town
I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out

[Chorus]
If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in
[Verse 3]
You are the moon
I am the sea
You pull me in
And gaze on down at me

[Verse 4]
I was alone
I thought I was immune
It's good to know the door
Can still be open wide

[Chorus]
If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

Oh yeah

[Chorus 2]
If I seem confused
It's just a state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

[Chorus]
If I seem a little strange
It's just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

Oh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
If I seem confused
It's just a state of the heart
You know I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

[Outro]
It's the state of the heart
(The state of the heart)
The state of the heart
(State of the heart)
Oh, ooo
It's the state of the heart
(The state of the heart)
The state of the heart
(The state of the heart)
Oh, oooEmbed
