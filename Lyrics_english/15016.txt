Dirty Road LyricsI've waited to say so long to the shame that owns you
The limits are bound, there's more to be found
Inside of you

Give it some time, the voices seem heavy, I know this
If you play by the hour
It's where you begin not where you will end

Today

And I feel like I am living
Where no one can find me
And I don't know how I've landed here
Sometimes I feel like those good things are behind me
Is the road supposed to get better than this?
And I'll find, yes I will find
Yes I will find, so long to the faith
Believe in yourself, no fantasy

Discovery blind, I hope you will find
The truth here...give it some time

Believing and knowing are two different things
Play by the silence
It's where you will end, not where you begin

Get up and open your eyes
Don't let yourself ever fall down
Get through it and learn how to fly
I know you will find a way

Today

It's the same damn dirty road
I will find a wayYou might also likeEmbed
