Last Minute Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy-Ayy-Ayo Bleu
Gorilla on the track
Turn Me Up Josh

[Verse 1]
They say you is what you hang around
Like what I look like snakin' a nigga who been ’round me, who been stayin' down?
You a clown, move around
And ain't gon’ lie, 'cause I got love for all the shawties who done grew up, turned to shooters now
You was wild, juvenile
You caught a case when you was an adult and ain't gon' lie, you thought it was gon' be the same as juvenile
When you was down, who was down?
Twenty-three and one, you locked down, plus you got a cellie doin' a hunnid now
[Chorus]
You tryna pray last minute, he ain't listenin'
I feel the love from these diamonds when they glistеnin’
Know how you feel when you finally get attention
’Causе before, it seem like niggas wouldn't listen

[Verse 2]
I got some fam’ who just came around, they say they love me now
Seen the fatherhood that we been on, they give 'em onesies now
And I heal the grudge with a nigga I love, I give him money now
Baby momma drama got me rushin' into them rubbers now
Told his ass, "Stop lackin," but I caught him lackin' a couple times
When I think ’bout Iris, I get in my feelings, wish I could hug her now
I don't phony kick it with rap niggas, I don't give my number out
Lotta bitch niggas woulda been dead if I ain't humbled down, oh (Gorilla on the track)
And I'm so excited
But I ain't gon' rat myself to a big indictment
I speak my pain off the top, that's why I quit writin'
Let bro down when he was tryna box, that's why I quit fightin' (Ayo Bleu)

[Chorus]
You tryna pray last minute, he ain't listenin'
I feel the love from these diamonds when they glistenin'
Know how you feel when you finally get attention
'Cause before, it seem like niggas wouldn't listen

I was tryna sell my Link card to get a blick, y'all
I was actin' for them hoes like I was a big dawg
No, I ain't have shit, but I'm the shit, yah
No, I ain't have shit, but I'm the shit, yah3Embed
