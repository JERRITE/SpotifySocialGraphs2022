Nobodyâ€™s Perfect Lyrics[Brain]:
Aye, that sauceman. Yea, that sauceman. Aye, that sauceman

[Heart}:
Oh my Gosh. Can you please shut up. You're really getting on my nerves now yo. Like, we need a song for the ladies

[Mad Sadiq}:
It doesn't matter if you go to church every Sunday or you don't believe in anything at all. The definition of sin is the transgression against a principle or standard

BROSO
PLAYA we out here
Mr. Jackson
[Verse 1]:
This is for all the ones that slept on
Stank hoes I crept on
Sour niggas and Epsom
Mad he cooking with Teflon
He got a Colombian-a
Remind him of her sweet mama
She making money already and ain't down with that drama
She praise me like Dalai Lama
Throw neck like that crazy llama
Drop it like it's hot, cause she know I'll make her pop
And I'm praying that her pops, won't hate me like the cops
'Bout solid as a rock, wang Johnson like The Rock
Cause I put it in her bottom, prol-ly hurts a lot
Crying and she getting snot (ew)
All up on my jock
But I banged her like a Glock
All the time like a clock
And I nutted on her face
Make her faithful like Mase
If she scream grab the tape, pray to God this not rape
Aw, shit
Cause you know that I will tape it
Said her name was V, so you know she let me take it
Think I'm falling in love, ouu girl let me taste it
Instead I G-T-A, so you know that I was wasted
Now lady, lady
You deserve less stress
So please be with me cause nobody's perfect
You might also like[Hook]:
Nobody's Perfect, uh
But you deserve it baby, baby
Because you're perfect for me
Nobody's Perfect but girl you deserve it baby, baby
Because you're perfect for me

[Bridge]:
We zoning, We zoning
I love to make her moan and
She love to feel my bone and
We loving in the morning
She never play those games, games, games
And baby you know you spark my flame, flame, flame, eh

[Verse 2]:
Oh Lord
She a college girl
Said she wanna study at Chapel Hill
Prol-ly have to visit just on the weekend when I'm wondering how that ass would feel
Cause, baby girl I adore you
Please let my love adorn you
And Imma give you all of me, if I can just get more of you
I hate it when you judge yourself
Hate it when you think you're somebody else
Just be you girl nobody else, cause your body is the only thing that compels
Me to see in love is where I fell
Feelin' on you like I'm reading braille
I'm a God so you now I'll never fail
You a queen so sip on your Holy Grail
[Hook}:
Nobody's Perfect, uh
But you deserve it baby, baby
Because you're perfect for me
Nobody's Perfect but girl you deserve it baby, baby
Because you're perfect for me

[Bridge]:
We zoning, We zoning
I love to make her moan and
She love to feel my bone and
We loving in the morning
She never play those games, games, games
And baby you know you spark my flame, flame, flame, eh

[Major]:
His mind is troubled
Seeking an enlightened path to success
Though success isn't the only thing he would like out of life
It is the pure foundation that drives his intuition

[The Starrkeisha Choir]:
One, two, three, four
I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I follow, I follow, I follow
I will follow him, follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep (too deep)
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
We will follow him (follow him)
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep (too deep)
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Oh yea, (I love him)
Oh yes I love him, (I'll follow)
I'm gonna follow, (true love)
You'll always be my true love, (forever)
From now until forever
I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I follow, I follow, I follow
You'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love
From now until forever, forever, forever
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away, away from his loveEmbed
