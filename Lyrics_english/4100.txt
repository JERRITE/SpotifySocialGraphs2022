[Pre-car: Anitta & Maluma]
You leave with her hand and see her so nervous
Your gaze is very curious when you are on me
A long time ago we tried and the thing was not good
But girlfriend is not a wife because this is for you
[Chorus: Anitta & Maluma, both]
Thus, because the one who expects what he wants
Thus, thus' tamo agree, whatever it is
Today for you, then for me
Vamo 'there,' tamo here
Today for you, then for me
Vamo 'there,' tamo here (Maluma, baby)

[Verse 1: Maluma]
Since the time disguises, the panty pa'l la'o
I taking two crown ', well snatched
Many paparazzis for everything 'La'o
Do you remember 'all the cochineo in the Lambo rent'o?
Quiet (ha), see what life is like
Today you have me writing: "Why so lost?"
And calm (JA), breathe and hesitate
That I have new girlfriend that nothing takes away

[Chorus: Anitta, Anitta & Maluma]
Thus, because the one who expects what he wants
Thus, thus' tamo agree, whatever it is
Today for you, then for me
Vamo 'there,' tamo here ('tamo here)
Today for you, then for me (for me)
Vamo 'there,' tamo here (here)

Wait a little more, more
That I am going to give you
Want more ', more', but now,
We already know everything that will happen

[Bridge: Maluma & Anitta]
And I do not say mess, that I have mine
And it is not when you want, but when I tell you
Let's wait a year, maybe two or four
But for the moment the four
I do not say mess, that I have mine
And it is not when you want, but when I tell you
Let's wait a year, maybe two or four
But what arrives

[Chorus: Anitta, Anitta & Maluma]
Thus, because the one who expects what he wants
Thus, thus' tamo agree, whatever it is
Today for you, then for me
Vamo 'there,' tamo here ('tamo here)
Today for you, then for me (for me)
Vamo 'there,' tamo here (here)

[Outro: Maluma]
