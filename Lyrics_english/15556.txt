Five minutes Lyricsya I got tired of being playing hidden
Don't look for me here I am
If I did not give your face before it is not cowardice
You well know how I am

I do not give me a reverse
The word returns the truth laziness
And even more, if it's you

What do you mean?
I give you five minutes Evogate
You don't think I have nothing more to do
And if greeting you was pure courtesy
Last time you were so happy
Today you look very good
Life of a thousand laps I let you know
Now you're down and I'm up
You forget that you didn't give me good morning
When the other appeared
Your attack plan does not work
There is no reconquest, with me the plane went

And I'm sorry for you, you've lost the shame
What a shame, but I'm not your napkin
Go from here, what else do you want from me?

What do you mean?
I give you five minutes Evogate
You don't think I have nothing more to do
And if greeting you was pure courtesy
Last time you were so happy
Today you look very good
Life of a thousand laps I let you know
Now you're down and I'm up

[I give you five minutes Evogate]
[You don't think I have nothing more to do]
And if greeting you was pure courtesy
Last time you were so happy
Today you look very good
Life of a thousand laps I let you know
Now you're down and I'm up

I give you five minutes Evogate
You don't think I have nothing more to do
And if greeting you was pure courtesy
