Consume Lyrics[Intro: Tokyo Ghoul]
Honto wa watashi kizuitetan desu
Anata ga watashi o mite ite kureta koto

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Alright, alright, woah
Why you pointing at me with that knife?
I've been cutting corners all my life, girl
The terror doesn't blossom overnight, no
She's running through the city in a rampage
Pressing on her fingers 'til the bones break
There's blood all in her nose from the propane
But a needle to the skin will make the pain fade (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Yeah, ah-ah
This is what I do, ah-ah
Take another bite, ah-ah
Big enough to chew

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"
But, girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But, baby, don't abuse it
These voices in my head screaming, "Run now"
I'm praying that they're human

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]
Rollin', rollin', rolling back your eyes to your mind like
Oh, woah, the pressure in the gland's tight
Yeah, woah, yeah, it's either kill or be killed like
Oh, woah, the blood is either poured or it’s spilt like

[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Yeah, ah-ah
This is what I do, ah-ah
Take another bite, ah-ah
Big enough to chew
You might also like[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"
But, girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But, baby, don't abuse it
These voices in my head screaming, "Run now"
I'm praying that they're human

[Verse 3: Goon Des Garcons]
Alright, alright, woah
Love you, but you cannot spend the night, nah
I've been alone almost all my life, girl
And shit like that don't change up overnight, sweet
I let you sleep in my tee
Tell me the things that you don’t normally tweet
Acid and LSD and smokin' blunts on the beach
69 down 69, so we can both get a piece, yeah
I’ve been cutting corners like my whole life
Backstabbing bitches tryna' kill me with the whole knife
Day I die'll be the only day a nigga ghostwrite
When I go, they'll treat me like a god if this shit goes right

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"
But, girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But, baby, don't abuse it (Calm down)
These voices in my head screaming, "Run now" (Don't run)
I'm praying that they're human
[Outro: Mitchel Cave]
Please understand that I'm trying my hardest
My head's a mess, but I'm trying regardless
Anxiety is one hell of a problem
She's latching onto me, I can't resolve it
It's not right, it's not fair, it's not fair
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair
Oh, no, no, no (Don't run)
Don't run, don't run8Embed
