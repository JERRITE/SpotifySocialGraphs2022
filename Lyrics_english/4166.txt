Mature Lyrics ["Matura" ft letter. Bad Bunny]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
Yeh-Yeh-Yeh

[Pre-Caro: Cosculluela]
I spend all day thinking about you (-i, -i), i-i
Is that your memory does not let me live
And when the night falls, the cell sounds and as usual I answer it
Although you and I know very well 'what what is' doing is incorrect
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
But you 'go big,' tá matura (wuh)
The year passes and you get the tougher (prru)
Baby, how heals you ', Yeh-eh
While torture ', Yeh
But you 'go big,' tá mature
The year pass' and you get tougher
Baby, how heals you ', Yeh
While torture ', Yeh

[Verse 1: cosculluela]
(PRR-PRR, PRR, GRR)
These people ask me that if they are a maniacal (OH)
Met Bellaco, bo, that and 'a machine
Blond hair that endures any flood (hah, prr)
From Asia, that's not pharmacy dye (haha; nope)
Works because she points, fits (grr; zah!)
And to 'what you have', mommy, smells again 'e box (wuh)
Zero Miles, a boyfriend, but is already obvious
That since he saw me he melted to 'the roll (eye)
Life will unravel ', she doesn't drink madra (hah)
She likes Rosè in La Mercedes quadrá '
La Chamaquita does not want right now, she asks me now
And 'tá snoring' e lady (rrra, ah-ah)
This shaman is not limited
She believes is a lady and with me she gets away (hey, that; prru!)

Baby, how heals you ', Yeh-eh
While torture ', Yeh
But you 'go big,' tá mature
The year pass' and you get tougher
Baby, how heals you ', Yeh
While torture ', Yeh

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny & Cosculluela]
Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh
The baby puts the kush (Wuh), but today wax wants (hah!)
With me it comes when you leave (wuh)
To make you come I have the Fast Pass (Pass)
Today I will put it inside the G-Class (ah-ah-ah-ah; rrra!)
I know that another wave, part of the Honda
I don't get round (no), I give you to the tonga
Natural and Roberto Cavalli
A VECE 'LAS PALI, but almost always Kush of Cali (Hah!)
Ma ', I'm never going to erase our first time
I am all yours, but you never believe me
I bought you to 'Gucci, Baby, Pa'l Cajo Guess
Bad Bunny, Baby, Baby (Prr!)

[Chorus: Cosculluela & Bad Bunny]
But you 'go big,' tá mature
The year pass' and you get tougher
Baby, how heals you ', UH-UH (RRRAR)
While torture ', UH-UH (AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
But you 'are big,' tá matura (prr)
The year pass' and you get tougher
Baby, how heals you '(Baby), Yeh
While torture '
