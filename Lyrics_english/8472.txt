Your Lyrics game [your game lyrics "]

[Stanza 1]
Yesterday I took my suitcase and left
I don't know if I want to forget you
I don't know how to stop suffering, love
And although I don't know if you think of me
If one day you will pass through here
I only know that this can't end like this

[Pre-stribe]
And think about it, think it can't go worse
If I have already swallowed all your lies
Think about it, think that we are only two, love
[Chorus]
Come, approach and tell me that
You dare, no
You can't, not anymore
You love me, here
If I'm leaving, you come
I do not want to see you
So don't stay, there

[Stanza 2]
You could fix it without fleeing
If you are not going to regret it
But I'm not going to insist, love
And if I thank you for coming
And if I have already tired of arguing
What do you want of me?
Because I see it, I see it
That I already know your game
And I don't believe it anymore, I don't want it anymore
You got lost in your ego
I see it, I see it
That I already know your game
And I don't believe it anymore, I don't want it anymore

[Pre-stribe]
And think about it, think it can't go worse
If I have already swallowed all your lies
Think about it, think that we are only both, love

Come, approach and tell me that
You dare, no
You can't, not anymore
You love me, here
If I'm leaving, you come
I do not want to see you
So don't stay, there

[Bridge]
And think about it
Think that it can't go worse
If I listen to everything you say the same
Think about it, think we are no longer you and I, love

[Chorus]
Come, approach and tell me that
You dare, no
You can't, not anymore
You love me, here
If I'm leaving, you come
I do not want to see you
So don't stay, there1embed
