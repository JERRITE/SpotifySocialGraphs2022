W4TN Lyrics[Verse 1]
Full lips and tongue dipped in raw nectar
Keep it cold outside cuz I can't sweat ya
Get him hot, shoot ya shot, it's no pressure
Oiled up and ribbed just for your pleasure
Tryna ease inside just to undress you
Went from DM to my couch leather
Fetishize my waistline, a thick measure
Arched back on loan from my ancestors
Now all these n****s all want a free sample
A taste of the goods, I don't think they can handle
All ready for jelly, silhouettes and a candle
A full course meal I'm tryna eat I got em
[Chorus]
All thе bitches want a place if you feeling right
[?] let's gеt prissy cuz we're wild for the night
All the bitches want a place if you feeling right
[?] let's get prissy cuz we're wild for the night
All the bitches want a place if you feeling right
[?] let's get prissy cuz we're wild for the night
All the bitches want a place if you feeling right
[?] let's get prissy cuz we're wild for the nightYou might also likeEmbed
