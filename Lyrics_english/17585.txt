SAILBOAT LyricsThe water’s deeper where I come from
I’d rather dive in for the long run
Cause baby I- don’t  lie, don’t try it I’ll make it all right
Don’t lie, don’t I, I make it all right
Don’t lie, I won’t fight with ya
Yeah I should know cause I’ve been here before

In your water
Roaming
Thunder
Storming
Shoulda
Never
Let ya
Hold me…
(Repeat)
What do ya know, I’m floating outta control, again with ya…
What do ya know, I’m floating outta control, again with ya…
What do ya know, I’m floating outta control, again with ya…
What do ya know, I’m floating outta control, hey
Babe I shoulda known

In your water
Roaming
Thunder
Storming
Shoulda
Never
Let ya
Hold me…

Who woulda thought
Ever thought you’d get caught on the wild side
Bet it’s your loss, if you get caught on the wild side……..with meYou might also likeEmbed
