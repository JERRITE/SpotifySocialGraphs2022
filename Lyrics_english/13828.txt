Same Old Ways Lyrics[Verse 1]
Screech like tire for me
Ignore, I contemplate
No desires
To turn out second place
Please, I'm blessed but hazy
It's deep, so mind out what you say
Na-na, na-na, na-na

[Pre-Chorus]
You're never gon' believe what I done
If you wanna know, pull up on me
It seems a little peak to threaten
But we don't mind some enemies
Why you second-guessing?
You know it's not my ting to keep it messy, yeah
Why you make it complex? Hey
You know you can't hear me when you be stressin', yeah
[Chorus]
When I said do it, yeah, I meant today
Watch me touch roads on my same old ways
You'll get that WhatsApp by the end of day
Blacked-out Bally and a new North Face
When I said do it, yeah, I meant today
Watch me touch roads on my same old ways
You'll get that WhatsApp by the end of day
Blacked-out Bally and a brand new Range

[Verse 2]
This ain't at all news to me
Oh no, my bad, why don't you come sit down?
All this is so common, cutie
Na√Øvety's more endearin' than you know, sweets
But it makes you sleepy
Turns them thoughts to dreamin'
I keep you 'cause I'm greedy, you complete me

[Verse 3]
I take more and more and more and more and more time to decide
To dress down or take you 'round, invade the town
I'm saved by what, bell me den
You know I'm never gonna say just to say
You know I'm never gonna pay to play
One save, one save
One save and it's all over for ya
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're never gon' believe what I done
If you wanna know, pull up on me
It seems a little peak to threaten
But we don't mind some enemies
Hold it down
Hundred bands laid on the ground
You chattin' breeze, pay me now
We still won't consider giving you a peek in

[Chorus]
When I said do it, yeah, I meant today
Watch me touch roads on my same old ways
You'll get that WhatsApp by the end of day
Blacked-out Bally and a new North Face
When I said do it, yeah, I meant today
Watch me touch roads on my same old ways
You'll get that WhatsApp by the end of day
Blacked-out Bally and a brand new RangeEmbed
