​you mean the whole wide world to me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Darling, you mean the whole wide world to me
Darling, you are sweeter than I ever dreamed
Darling, you make me believe in make-believe
Darling, you mean the whole wide world to me

[Chorus]
What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
Baby girl, it’s bigger than the whole wide world
[Verse 2]
Darling, you mean the whole wide world to me
Darling, you light up everyone you meet
With a smile you give away so easily
Darling, you mean the whole wide world to me

[Chorus]
What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
What do I do with how I feel inside?
If you ever wonder how much I love you, girl
It's bigger than the whole wide world
It’s bigger than the whole wide worldYou might also likeEmbed
