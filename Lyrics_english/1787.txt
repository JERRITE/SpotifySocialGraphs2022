Trance Dance Lyrics[Intro]
Oh Oh O-o-oh
Oh Oh O-o-oh
Just wanted to say, I hope that you'll know
You're closer tonight, than ever now

[Chorus]
Every day and night I pray for life I need it
Hope is out of sight no resupply this season
I try so hard to see it, but I can't believe it
Fate's been callin' me here - all this time
Yeah, I'm searching, but i don't find
Oh, and I can't say, that i know why
I try so hard to see it, but I can't believe it
Fate's been callin' me here - all this time
[Verse]
Sixth sense, oh why, do I make flaws in my own shine
I can't wait, my whole life, just to get lost in the lone mind
The day might fall if I don't try hard
Everyone talk 'Is he gon' rise up?'
I can't lay thoughts, keep em all tied up
I need your all, but I know -
I too damn high to see her, barely recognize the features
Every damn day that I try to meet'ya, someway I denied the beacon
For all my days I've tried to flee her, don't leave me dry, i need ya
Do it your ways and I'd like to see her, don't play, don't fight the fever - some are like

[Bridge]
It's okay, it's alright, you won't be waiting for long - all alone
Everybody wants the life, but no one's ready like you
It's okay, it's alright, the whole world's feeling unknown - all alone
Everybody hopes you're alright, and Oh, i see it in you
(x2)

[Chorus]
Every day and night I pray for life I need it
Hope is out of sight no resupply this season
I try so hard to see it, but I can't believe it
Fate's been callin' me here - all this time
Yeah, I'm searching, but i don't find
Oh, and I can't say, that i know why
I try so hard to see it, but I can't believe it
Fate's been callin' me here - all this time

Just wanted to say, I hope that you'll know
