Dance Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been staring at the wall today
To find some hidden meaning
My laundry's clean, my mama called
To ask me how I'm feeling
I've been running out of things to think
So what's the point of dreaming?
I called all my friends cause I can't get
Along with all my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been watching from a distance
How the seasons change
[Chorus]
I've been lost, lost in the rhythm lately
I don't know, know how to dance alone
Know how to dance alone
I've been lost, lost in the rhythm lately
I don't know, know how to dance alone
Know how to dance alone

[Verse 2]
I've been staring at the wall today
Still looking for some meaning
I tried talking to myself for a change
To ask me how I'm feeling
I've been running out of room to think
I need a higher ceiling
Called all my friends cause I need help
Distract me from my demons

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been watching from a distance
How the seasons change

[Chorus]
I've been lost, lost in the rhythm lately
I don't know, know how to dance alone
Know how to dance alone
I've been lost, lost in the rhythm lately
I don't know, know how to dance alone
Know how to dance alone
You might also like[Outro]
I've been lost, lost in the rhythm lately
I don't know, know how to dance alone
Know how to dance alone4Embed
