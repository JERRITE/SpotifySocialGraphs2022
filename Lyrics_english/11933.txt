Devil On Yo Right Shoulder Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
Told you
I don't know your name, yeah
Told you
I don't know your name, what

[Chorus]
Babygirl, let's get that, maybe we can get up
If I call your phone, girl, tell me, will you pick up? (What?)
Sometimes you not gettin' there, maybe they don't get ya
Feel like you not fittin' in, maybe they don't fit ya
Devil on your right shoulder, angel on your left shoulder
Ain't nobody left over, ain't nobody left sober
[Verse 1]
Said you need an angel, maybe I can transport you
Maybe I can escort you
I can do the best for you
You need motivation, you need you a go-getter
Don't need help from no nigga
Body got that coke figure
Body look like gold
All these niggas hoes, trick 'em
You see and you go sic 'em
Then fuck 'em, they not pimpin'
That Rolls Royce color blush
And I must admit I miss you
And I'm on a money mission
I want them guided figures
Yeah, I'm on that Roddy get Ricch
I'm on the road to riches
Yeah, I turned my goals to visions
These niggas make no decisions
And she made her own decision
And I made that bold decision
And it make no correlation
Now we both just co-existing

[Chorus]
Babygirl, let's get that, maybe we can get up
If I call your phone, girl, tell me, will you pick up? (What?)
Sometimes you not gettin' there, maybe they don't get ya
Feel like you not fittin' in, maybe they don't fit ya
Devil on your right shoulder, angel on your left shoulder
Ain't nobody left over, ain't nobody left sober

You shouldn't have to feel like you fighting a war
You shouldn't have to feel like you fighting a war
You should wanna feel all this water ashore
You should wanna feel like you finally insured
Right now I feel like everything I want, I afford
I just put a new Chanel bracelet by her core
And free CHE out on the souf side, what the fuck we beefing for?
We was from the same part, we was partners before
And right before I sleep, you know I gotta thank the Lord
'Cause I can die tomorrow and get took right up out my glory
And if I die tomorrow, tell me, will I open doors?
Please don't show no sorrow for me, just move it accordingly
Heaven, I'm looking forward

[Chorus]
Babygirl, let's get that, maybe we can get up
If I call your phone, girl, tell me, will you pick up? (What?)
Sometimes you not gettin' there, maybe they don't get ya
Feel like you not fittin' in, maybe they don't fit ya
Devil on your right shoulder, angel on your left shoulder
Ain't nobody left over, ain't nobody left sober2Embed
