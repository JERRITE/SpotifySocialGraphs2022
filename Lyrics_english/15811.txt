It is for you Lyrics [lyrics of "It's for you"]

[Saying]
And every time I get up
And I see that by my side you are
I feel renewed

[Verse 1]
And I feel annihilated
Annihilated if you are not
You control all my truth
And everything that is of more
[Pre-car]
Your eyes slowly take me to the sun
And your mouth tells me about love and heart
Your skin has the color of a red sunset

[Chorus]
And it is for you
That beats my heart
And it is for you
That my eyes shine today
And it is for you
I have spoken about love again
And it is for you
That calms my pain

[Verse 2]
And every time I look for you
And I can't still find you
I feel a vagabon
Lost by the world
Disorderly if you are not
How do you move my happiness
And everything that is of more

[Pre-car]
Your eyes slowly take me to the sun
And your mouth tells me about love and heart
Your skin has the color of a red sunset

And it is for you
That my eyes shine today
And it is for you
That calms my pain

[Saying]
And every time I get up
And I see that by my side you are
I feel renewed

[Pre-car]
Your eyes slowly take me to the sun
And your mouth tells me about love and heart
Your skin has the color of a red sunset

[Chorus]
And it is for you
That beats my heart
And it is for you
I have spoken about love again
And it is for you
That my eyes shine today
And it is for you
That calms my pain

And it is for you
And it is for you
And it is for you
That calms my pain1embed
