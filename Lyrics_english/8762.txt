Roll On Down the Highway Lyrics[Verse 1]
We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and winding road
Look on the map I think we've been here before
Close all the doors let's roll once more
Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror is he still followin' me?

[Chorus]
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll
[Verse 2]
Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Move out boys, let's get ready to race
454 coming over the hill
The man on patrol, is gonna give us a bill
The time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movin' if we're gonna make a buck

[Chorus]
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll, roll
