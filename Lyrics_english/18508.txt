TranslationsPortuguêsCrystal Clear Lyrics[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
Mmm, I don't wanna shut you out
I don't wanna rush around or slow down
This time, I wanna stay right here
I wanna make it crystal clear
That I won't give in to the fear

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I remember standing on the edge
Closing my eyes
Counting to three, I
Jump in with the rush in my head
Only to find the water was concrete
And now you're pumpin' air to my lungs
This don't feel anything like sinking
In fact, no matter how deep I go
Into you, it looks like the water is crystal clear

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear (Clear)

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
Here we go
Gonna risk it again
Let's hope it's the last time
We don't know
How this could end
Let's hope it won't have to (Hmm)
Won't have to (Hmm)

I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear
I won't give in to the fear
Crystal clear

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Rusty Williams]
Friends or lovers
(Clear) Won't give in to the fear
Friends or lovers, which will it be?
It's a feeling (Friends or lovers)
(Clear) I'm still right here
Friends or lovers, which will it be?6Embed
