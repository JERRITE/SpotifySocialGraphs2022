AGárrala (Remix) Lyrics [letter of "AGárrala (Remix)"]

[Intro: Periquito]
Youh
Is the clan trebol
The Bacatranes arrived (the Papasi)
Out of pact again
What happened?
Wuh!

[Chorus: Periquito]
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a
[Verse 1: Berto "El Original"]
What are you waiting for?
Don't you see what you are looking at you?
With sight you are looking for
What's going on?
Take advantage of my mambo
This is not a weapon
If she activates it will come into heat
Look for a drink, alcohol
After a while they will feel better, music and alcohol
Crazy, the trebol tells you
Pégala, azotala
Without fear, not Na '
Look at her, look at her, if you laugh
I give him, you give him ahead and behind
She goes to to'a

[Chorus: Periquito]
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a

She is loose and nothing will prevent me from roof
I submit, mamita, do not be wrong
I pass you through the la'o and I have not seen friction '
I walk with a crazy
Who like me? Who like me? No one
That I dance, that it roofs you, that guaya
I speak like that, for you, I don't get up
Listen to this choir for you, you understand the details

[Chorus: Periquito]
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a
Hold it, pégala, azótala, pégala
Take it to dance, who goes to to'a
Pégala, Azótala, hold on
That she goes to to'a
