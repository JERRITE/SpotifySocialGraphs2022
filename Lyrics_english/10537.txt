Letter to My Ex (Thank You, Goodbye) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dear my ex-fiancé
I got some things that I wanna say
Don't shy away, don't hide away
Remember you said communicate
So if I could press rewind
Untie your ribbons from my eyes
Un-kiss the kiss that led to this
No swallowing of the lies you spit

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now, who's stronger now?
You tore me up, but I'm dancing somehow
Woah
Just go
[Chorus]
You can't hurt me anymore
I saw the light, thank you, goodbye
You can take your things, there'll be no encore
I saw the light, so thank you, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Now I'm slaying magical
I'm channelling my inner animal
Unbreakable, yeah, untouchable
I'm coming back to me and to my survival
Burning fires dominatе
What's in my heart, let's celеbrate
I found a way, yeah, I broke away
I don't have to care when you fade to grey

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now, who's stronger now?
You tore me up, but I'm dancing somehow
Woah
Just go, yeah

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me anymore
I saw the light, thank you, goodbye
You can take your things, there'll be no encore
I saw the light, so thank you, goodbye
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, goodbye

[Bridge]
I was a lady in waiting
You were some kinda cool thing
What the hell was I thinking?
I saw the light, thank you, goodbye
I can't hear the church bells
I've broken your love spell
And I'm back with my girlfriends
I saw the light, thank you, goodbye

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me anymore
I saw the light, thank you, goodbye
You can take your things, there'll be no encore
I saw the light, so thank you, goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, goodbyeEmbed
