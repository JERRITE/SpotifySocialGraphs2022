Rock $ TAR Lyrics [text of "Rock $ TAR"]

[Verse 1: Danien]
Flight away from here
This girl girl with kim
I just want og
Lie on Weda beds
Mom, yes, one day we will be rich
I'm just thinking about 'sti money
Three videos and are all 90
Full of sluts from Milan to L.A.
Yes, from Milan to L.A.
Yes, from Milan to L.A.
Your girl listen to my pieces
I leave the trophies at home
You hear it what I taste when kisses her in the evening (Bleah)
Feel what I taste when kisses it in the evening
Fuck 'Ste Tipe, I just want the money
I have different dreams from yours
I come from the moon, you see me distracted
She wants a dinner, I put my cock on the plate
Yes we are different (kvlto)
Yes, we are the different (rock $ TAR)
Yes, we are different from everyone
We are the rock $ TAR, we are the weed $ tar
[Bridge: Danien & Theø]
We are upstairs among the stars
(I have my head on the stars, let's shine like the stars)
With her one night and then bye bye
(I do a life as a rock $ tar
She pays me 'is life as a rock $ tar
We are the rock $ TAR)

[Refrain: Danien & Theø]
I don't want trouble, I don't want trouble, I don't want trouble
I want it right, right, just for one night
Come and then go, yes baby, come but then go

[Verse 2: Theø]
My Weeda Gusto Bubble Gum
My girl a ass bubble butt
He turns naked in the house as he turns a blunt
You fuck in his hand, watch Tipe on cam
We install what I think
Of 'this people you cannot trust
The Got Trouble, Trouble
Bitches Calling, Calling, Calling, Calling me
Now I Gotta Go, Leave me Alone
I go down with Dani, down to Rome at the Rione La Dark is a family
Yes I am the son of Troy who broke the heart to your daughter
Mom I know these words leave you speechless, yes
I swear to you I make money
In 'this shitty house no that you don't die
I'm thinking about doing a million
I'm thinking about doing a million
I'm thinking about doing a million
I'm thinking about doing on a cannon
You know they do these whores
WhatsAppano both me and Dani
You did it and you are full of it seems
Because you know you're a whore

[Refrain: Danien & Theø]
I don't want trouble, I don't want trouble, I don't want trouble
I want it right, right, just for one night
