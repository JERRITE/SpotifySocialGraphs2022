If (remix) lyrics [letter of "if it occurs (remix)" ft. Sech & zion]

[Intro: sech]
(This is the remix)
Another night, called for seeing me
He has Kush and do too, but he doesn't turn

[Saying: zion]
(Z-Diddy)
He says he doesn't smoke, but if I get on, she gives him, she gives her
He kissed me and felt the humidity down there, uh-yeh
It's like walking in the sea sailing blindly
You are a ghost and you don't let it see you
[Chorus: Myke Towers & Farruko]
That gives him when he is in solitude
It is punished mercilessly, you come 'And you are going'
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to happen to mine 'if it occurs (Pu-pum)
That gives him when he is in solitude
It is punished mercilessly, you come 'And you leave' (it comes 'and you go')
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to happen to mine 'if it occurs

[Verse 1: sech]
(This is')
Is that if it occurs after the concert
Sea 'inside your apartment
You do not ere 'from here, I notice it for your accent
It's not love, but shouts: "Sorry!"
I am not to give him repeat, I always write it in the 'tweet'
I'm going to make a tutorial, for you forget me
That does not take me out of your mind
To return, that was hot
Another night, called for seeing me
He has Kush and do too, but he doesn't turn

[Verse 2: Myke Towers]
The ma'i also tá tá and that is going to inherit it (je)
These fools throw me, then they want to fix
They envy it, but they know they will not arrive
I don't care what they want to claim
'We drink cognac and burning bumps
In one hundred e 'tickets that she fell apart
The others dancing to you look mummies
And I don't forget how I ate you, you are still mine
That was, what are your fantasies?
And I without thinking, baby, I did it
I give you what you formerly, the champagne is cold
Hey, if you leave it ', she alone empties her
You Might Also Like [Bridge: Myke Towers]
I give you what you ask ', but don't take advantage of me
In a week, I saw her as eight vece '
Where do you want me to write to you? (Where, baby?)
For Instagram or Imessage?
In front of people I don't let them kiss me

[Chorus: Zion]
(Zion, Baby)
That gives him when he is in solitude
It punishes without mercy, you come and go '(no)
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to happen to mine 'if it occurs, oh, ay

[Verse 3: zion]
Tonight was dressed
A dress for I get up
It shows that he likes singer '
Because he always asks him to sing
Zun da da, already has his back sweat so much to dance like this
I swore that I had no evil, but when it gives it it transforms
It is released, begins to lose patience
While I kisses me wild
It does not put resistance and does it without prudence
Crazy because he takes off his suit
Asks me to speak with authority
That tonight I will be your priority
That is tired of loneliness
For that he will call me
[Chorus: SECH]
That gives him when he is in solitude
It is punished mercilessly, you come 'And you are' (you go ')
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to 'with the' mine 'if it occurs

[Verse 4: Archangel]
(Auh; Yah)
And if the thing occurs and I have the opportunity
And you are given a little more than you give
Then, I'm going to give you so hard
That will end saying: "No more" (haha)
Come and try me, and you will see what I am capable
I'm hard on bed then you'll say (Yah; Austin, Baby)
Tonight, let's go, forget about the first class
Today you walk with a fleeting star (so ask for more)
Creative, activate your curiosity
Give space to shine in you all that vanity (Yah)
You are loose, fine, delicious
Single, requested and pa 'high, putísima (auh)

[Choir: Archangel & Myke Towers]
That gives him when he is in solitude
It is punished mercilessly, you come 'And you go' (Lama)
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to happen to mine 'if it occurs (Young Kingz)
That gives him when he is in solitude
It is punished mercilessly, you come 'And you are going'
She and friends' are a society
And they know what is going to happen to mine 'if it occurs

[Verse 5: Farruko]
(PRI, Yah, Yah, Yah, Farru '!)
And if it occurs, baby, you took out the lotus
Because I walk with weight 'and today with you I explode them (pa!)
Tell your friend that I stopped being recording
That is not a movie and stop being pulling photo '(hahaha)
That Andamo 'Rulay, asks that there are
Here I have a torque 'and the Blue is under Straight (Pu-Pu-Pum)
The Galla is active, I also active
And I'm crazy 'and catch her and guavar the stirrup (tra, tra)
Let's see if as Ronca wigs away, the abuser
I am that the kidnapping and I take it from here now (pa!)
Let's see if e 'Verdá' that she is for me or stuck to chapiar al Vip
And not hot 'the food if you don't eat it
You don't ere 'a baby, baby, you ere' a woman
You know that if I hit you 'to go to To'a
(Tell me, talk me clearly, if it gives, we watches to To'a)

[Saying: Sech, Myke Towers, Zion, Sech & Zion]
(Young Kingz, Baby)
He says he doesn't smoke, but if I get on, she gives him, she gives her
I entered the disco 'without being age, UH-YEH
It's like walking in the sea sailing blindly
You are a ghost and you don't let it see you
