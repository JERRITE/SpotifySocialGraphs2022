A long time ago Lyrics [letter from "a long time"]

[Intro]
UH, UH-UH-UH
UH, UH-UH-UH, UH, UH

[Chorus]
I want to meet you a long time (Yes)
Look that they have told me well about you
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you
Solita, exclusive to me (-siva pa 'me)
I want to meet you a long time
Look that they have told me well about you (aha)
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you (baby; have you)
[Verse 1]
Red wine, seawater
On the Coast of Norway, a northern light
Phenomenon in the sky difficult not to look
She is that, so wonderful
A beauty history as a monument in Greece
Classic as Venice Channel
Fine, it is distinguished by its elegance
In his gaze he can see glamor in abundance
She has what others are missing
She is one of those women who stand out
And if I don't have her
I want one like her who loves to distribute me

[Chorus]
I want to meet you a long time (Yes)
Look that they have told me well about you
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you
Solita, exclusive to me (-siva pa 'me)
I want to meet you a long time
Look that they have told me well about you (aha)
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you (baby; have you)

[Verse 2]
And gently I feel that your body consumption
Slowly
You arrived precisely, mommy, at the right time
Like hot chocolate at breakfast (aha)
Like the sun when in the morning
And its rays penetrating your window
From afar I feel your immense love
From afar I feel your intense heat, PRRA
You are valuable as the gold of a mine
Hard as the great Chinese wall
I've never seen you, mommy, but I know you
I know because when I dream I see your face, baby

Look that they have told me well about you
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you
Solita, exclusive to me (-siva pa 'me)
I want to meet you a long time
Look that they have told me well about you (aha)
I even saw you in my dreams that I already want to have you (baby; have you)

[Outro]
YEP, now yes, well done
I am and I will continue to be "La Maravilla"
La Marash (Ark ')
