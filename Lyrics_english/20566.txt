Let Me Think About It Lyrics[Intro]
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm

[Verse 1]
You saying baby, «I’ll take you for a ride»
Let’s get together, work it all night
I’ll be your lover, your sexy little thing
I’ll make you feel like heaven is near
[Hook]
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm, rrrak!

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on girl believe me I’ll make you see
That I am the true way to ecstasy
Touch me, feel me, then you will find
That we are meant to be and I ain’t lying

[Chorus]
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm
Let me think about it
M-m-m, mmm mmm mmm, rrrak!

[Verse 2:Fedde Le Grand]
Can I get with you, baby?
Blow your mind or whatever your like?
(Mmm mmm mmm, m-m-m)
(Let me think about it)
Think about it
You don’t have to think no more
Baby, come on
Cute as the sun, cute as the sun
Cute as the sun, let’s go
