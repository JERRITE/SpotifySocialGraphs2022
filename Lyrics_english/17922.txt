Almost human lyrics [verse 1]
I didn't look for you and you knew how to find
I didn't expect you and now I know that maybe
Is not human
Your body or your way of loving

[Verse 2]
Every word I could never use
A thought that encourages me to sin
It is not a crime
Loving you is a necessity
[Pre-car]
Five more minutes become eternal
If you are not, love
I do not need more
My only reality is
That every second of the day
With you know better

[Chorus]
Slowly you are going to burn me
In a fire that I don't want to turn off
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But by your side say it knows better
And there is no remedy for this disease
But I know that you feel the same
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But by your side it is better

[Verse 3]
We are perfect together, we are true
Two crazy people in a real world
Almost human
But different from others

[Pre-car]
Five more minutes become eternal
If you are not, love
I do not need more
My only reality is
That every second of the day
With you know better
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Slowly you are going to burn me
In a fire that I don't want to turn off
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But by your side say it knows better
And there is no remedy for this disease
But I know that you feel the same
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But your side

[Pre-car]
(Almost human, almost human)
That every second of the day
With you know better

[Chorus]
Slowly you are going to burn me
In a fire that I don't want to turn off
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But by your side say it knows better
And there is no remedy for this disease
But I know that you feel the same
Saying 'I love you' is nothing original
But by your side it is improved
