Snowqueen of Texas LyricsSnowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say that she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke
She's living in a cool green farmhouse;
If you go to Houston
Be quiet as a mouse

Met a man in Beirut
Having her name tattooed on his arm
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
Boots of Spanish leather, I never meant you any harm
I'm on my knees, your majesty;
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss for me
I'm on my knees your majesty
Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke
They say that she may be beaten
But I know that she's not broke
She's living in a cool green farmhouse;
If you go to Houston
Be quiet as a mouse
She's mending a fairy tale---
Reading her heart
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
That's a good motto
For some junkman's cart
I'm on my knees, your majesty;
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss for me
(I'm on my knees your majesty)
I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty.)
I'm on my knees your majesty
(I'm on my knees your majesty.)
Snowqueen...
