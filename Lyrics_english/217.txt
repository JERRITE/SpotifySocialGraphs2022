Achievements Lyrics[Intro: Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Chorus]
Thinkin' of back then when I seen my mama cry, ooh
Never again, I ain't seen in that shit in a while, ooh-woah-ooh
Talk to my granddad and I always say I'm fine
When I know I'm experiencin' the same pain as a child
Ten cars don't need no ride
I ain't buyin' that shit no, no, ooh
Get a driver for the week, that's how I float around, ooh
Call Starr to get K3, my little boy gon' lift my soul
Got Jaz to bring me peace
No, I don't need no extra hoes (Ooh-woo-ooh)
Bleeding, your love admit I need it
Change locations, 'cause I'm sayin that they sayin' they seen me
Even though I don't give no fuck
Cause if they saw me, I was beamin'
.38 with a built-in beam in, i8 on the interstate, speedin'
Niggas sayin' I brought my team in
Fuck around, gon' clear the whole scene, and
Send straight hollows through the scenery
Came up out of concrete and I been achievin' since
[Verse 1]
I can't be apart of your family
Hate that bitch 'cause I see she's just like her daddy
That ain't real at all, everyone got flaws
Can't chance it, manage, ask for help and they ain't get involved
Don't care at all, it's fuck the world and you can tell it all
I'm a thug nigga, take pride in these drugs nigga (Oh, yeah)
I don't fuck with fuck niggas
You can count up how many I bust, nigga (They dead)
Fill 'em up with slugs, nigga
You could ask these hoes, I love different
I ain't bringin' up no nigga, take your shit and you go thug with 'em
Huh, she gon' go and fuck on one of 'em niggas like I give a fuck
Get blues, I give her a clue like
When you choose, make sure they rich as us
Ha, or got more sticks than us
For a fact, they ain't drawin' more blood than us
These niggas won't be too much
Tryna do too much, I ain't changin' up
Old scary ass nigga gon' bring us up
Pussy ass nigga, I ain't phasin' nothin'
I ain't blood to you, so don't cuss me Five
Old fake ass Pi', I'ma real deal blood
I ain't stuntin' you, nigga, I wish you tried
We gon' leave you dead inside this club
Ol' wanna be hoe, you ain't my kind
Plus ain't more slimier than my girl
Lil Top the slimiest in the world
I ain't takin' no lick behind no bitch
It ain't 'bout my kids it ain't 'bout bein' rich
Fuck what they say, you can suck my dick
I done gave my all, just for my daughter
My sons won't never need no clique
Even though I wish I ain't exist, Momma look at all this shit I did (Ooh-woo-ooh)
Even though I wish I ain't exist, Momma look at all this shit I did (Ooh-woo-ooh)
Came out the slums, I ain't have shit
They still gon' talk down on your kid
