Secret Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
The first time the phone rings to my ear, I'm elusive, man
California saw me really fuckin' faded, man
Eye to eye in a passion dance
Secret boy with my secret plans
Talk me down and out my head in a double bed
New releases get delayed by the blogs again
Back me up if the tourin' fails
The sacred text is the album sales
You know I'm so down, never slow down
And I'm so for that, take control of that
I really saw you in that S-Class Benz
I saw the inside of your high rise then
A fuckin' waster in the way that I spend my time
Icy feelin's come to me in a foreign ride
Eye to eye in another time
Secrets kept of another kind
I can feel you breathin' hard when I'm by your side
I know the feelin' that's been keepin' you up at night
I and I is a passionate lie
Secret boy, in a secret life
[Verse 2]
I really felt impressed then...
There was somethin' that I missed then...
Somethin' about it tells me, that you don't even know me
Call me like the one
The one you've been ignorin'
Passin' out and then buy you somethin' foreign
I was really in Seattle with my last band soarin' like a real heartbreaker
West Coast tourin'
Wrote half an album before I bailed
Still collectin' from album sales
Call me when you want me or if somethin's really wrong
Baby, I just couldn't stand when I crashed that car
Secret texts when I ran the light
I and I is a passionate lie
Secret boy in a secret life...You might also like1Embed
