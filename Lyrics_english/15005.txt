Lifeless Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lifeless dead, that unclean bed
'Til or when her hunger's fed
How he'd wished that they would wed
"I promise on our love" she said
Promises were never kept
Alone on dirty floor he slept

[Chorus]
Yeah, lifeless dead
[Verse 2]
And although he'd not accept
She was gone and so he wept
Then a demon came to him
"You must know, I'm gonna win"

[Chorus]
Yeah, lifeless dead

[Verse 3]
He said, she said
She led him dead
He said "We bled"
She said “Not fed”

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless dead
Lifeless dead, lifeless deadYou might also like2Embed
