Tick Lyrics[Verse 1: TeaMarrr]
I want you to break down my backside
I want it, no cap, give me that fax line
I want you to wet down my backside, yeah
I miss the way you've rained down heavy on me

[Pre-Chorus: TeaMarrr]
Nobody fucks me like you ever could
I ain't had it in a long time, but while we're on time, let me fuck you
Love me from moon shine 'til your morning wood
Give it to me for the one time 'cause you dumb fine and I want you
[Chorus: TeaMarrr]
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'm not really tryna save face when I say this
I'm just saying that I wanna sit up on it, babe
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'm not really on some ho shit, but on some ho shit
If you hold this, you could probably get it, babe
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I want you to make it drip 'til my ocean lift
Then you can drive and ride and buy, buy the ship, baby
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Just blow my back out, show and act out, yeah

[Verse 2: SiR]
I'm on my way from the west side (West side)
No runnin' away from this get right (Right)
Beat up them walls 'til they all fall down
I'll rock the boat, just hold it steady for me
It's been a minute since I went up in that good-good
If I remember, last time was a great time, wanna take time if you're down
I got a brand new recipe up in my cookbook
Just for this special occasion, now that the fire is blazin', I know where I wanna take it, oh

[Chorus: TeaMarrr & SiR]
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I ain't even tryna play nice, I could break ice
With my love gun, yeah, it's fully loaded, baby
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I know we can't even stay, but when we lay up
What we makin' make me really wanna slay
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I keep divin' deeper down into sweeter sound
When I'm beatin' down all them pretty walls, babe
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'll blow your back out, just show and act out, yeah

Didn't think that I would cum
But you beat it up like I'm your enemy
I didn't mean to wet the floor, though
But I missed the way you've rained down heavy on me

[Pre-Chorus: TeaMarrr]
Nobody fucks me like you ever could
I ain't had it in a long time, but while we're on time, let me fuck you
Love me from moon shine 'til your morning wood
Give it to me for the one time 'cause you dumb fine and I want you

[Chorus: TeaMarrr, SiR, TeaMarr & SiR]
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'm not really tryna save face when I say this
I'm just saying that I wanna sit up on it, babe
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'm not really on some ho shit, but on some ho shit
If you hold this, you could probably get it, babe
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick (Ohh)
I want you to make it drip 'til my ocean lift
Then you can drive and ride and buy, buy the ship, baby (Ohh)
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick (Ohh)
Just blow my back out, show and act outEmbed
