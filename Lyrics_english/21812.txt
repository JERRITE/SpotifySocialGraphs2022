Still Trying LyricsWhen I wake up in the morning you know I'm gonna tell
I was standing looking backwards in the outs
You said there's room enough to cramping in the crowd
No movement here no friends to break us out
Stop breathing or we'll just win fast

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing
In these moments I forget to tell myself
And if you're rollin' in it long enough, your shit won't even smell
Is there no one I can trust to point it out
Well I can hardly be right here, I was spitting on myself
When I wake up in the morning you know I'm gonna tell

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

This wound is gonna cancel me out
This wound is gonna cancel me out
This wound is gonna cancel me out
This wound is gonna cancel me out

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thingYou might also like2Embed
