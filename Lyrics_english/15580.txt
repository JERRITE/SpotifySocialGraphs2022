Without awakening lyrics [lyrics by "without waking"]

[Verse 1]
I can be your sun, imagine
What can I fly and I can do everything
That I will be your light and the breeze that I will illuminate until the end

[Pre Coro 1]
I can navigate and I can travel
I can take off and in a dusk
I want everything to do and take you to the top, on top
[Chorus]
Without waking up, or down
Of this fleeting star
That in its light you fly
Traveling in a blue sky
Without hesitation, or wait
There is just time to love
Once and another
Until this dream ends baby

[Verse 2]
I know that tomorrow I will not be in nothing
And that this star will never leave us
And I know that at night I will take out my sword
We will go to the beyond

[Pre Coro 2]
At night the moon will come out
The stars will hug you

[Chorus]
Without waking up, or down
Of this fleeting star
That in its light you fly
Traveling in a blue sky
Without hesitation, or wait
There is just time to love
Once and another
Until this dream ends baby

That in its light you fly
Traveling in a blue sky
Without hesitation, or wait
There is just time to love
Once and another
Until this dream ends baby

Without waking up, without hesitation oh
Without waking up, without hesitation oh

Without waking up, or down
Of this fleeting star
That in its light you fly
Traveling in a blue sky
Without hesitation, or wait
There is just time to love
Once and another
Until this dream ends Nenaembed
