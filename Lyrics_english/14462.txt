Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh-Yeh
Bad Bunny, Baby

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Khea]
It's crazy
Send me videos to the Snap while touching
He tells me that if I arrive today, he can't wait, Yeh
Who dies for me, who wants to 'with me
That I will look for her, Yeh, to look for her, Yeh
It's crazy (crazy!)
I send me video 'to the snap while it is touched (while it is touched; wuh)
He tells me that if I arrive today, he can't wait (no), Yeh
Who dies for me, who wants to 'with me
That I will look for her, Yeh, that she will look for her
[Verse 1: khea]
I throw video 'by Snap (Snap)
Asking me to look for it (search)
That with him always ends bad (bad)
And that with me ends Mojá '(Mojá')
NENA There is no other equal (equal)
Fire on the bed (bed)
It comes to you 'with me Nomá' (Nomá ')
He looks at me when he's choking '(Heatrá')
Know ', baby, what a vamo' to do (baby; what a vamo 'to do)
I watched it 'to do tonight (I watched it' to do; ah)
Know ', baby, what a vamo' to do (baby; vamo 'to do)
I watched it, eh, tonight (I watched it 'to do; ah)

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Khea]
It's crazy (crazy!)
I send me the snap videos while touching (wuh)

Who dies for me, who wants to 'with me
That I will look for her, Yeh, to look for her, Yeh
It's crazy (it's crazy)
I send me the snap videos while touched (while touched)
He tells me that if I arrive today, he can't wait, Yeh (can't wait)

He took a crazy pill
And put the other half inside 'e my mouth (inside' e my mouth)
And I touch her, and she touches me
He doesn't want another, and I don't want another (I don't want another, ah)
Already and 'the owner of the place, she will lie down (knock me down)
If I stick, 'he tells me: "Give it to me" (he says: "Give it to me")
He took it out of my mouth to smoke him (pa 'smoking-mar-mar)
Know that now I watched it 'to have a better time
I am under his power, power (his power)
