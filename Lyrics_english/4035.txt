THE LYRICSDEJE ME calendar me at your waist
Let me love you madly
Let me give you a song
Let me invent a calendar
With a million anniversaries
Sorry for anticipation

To love you we will start with January
A thousand heart in February
And for March another song
April and May remind you that I love you
That all year you will go first
For love there is no condition
No matter the month or the station

I'll sing to your heart zon zon zon
There are so many days that he marks that that
That the calendar was filled there are no weeks without your voice
My calendar is one of the two
I know I'm a little advanced
Maybe for love
I control my heart
I know I had a few steps
But I love you here in my arms
Time is not a condition

To love you we will start with January
A thousand heart in February
And for March another song
And until December remind you that I love you
That all years you will go first
For love there is no condition
No matter the month or the station
My life I give you
I'll sing to your heart zon zon zon
There are so many days that he marks that that
That the calendar is filled there are no weeks without your voice
My calendar is one of the two

And I don't care if it's winter I will do it summer
And I don't care if it's cold I will give you hot
And I don't care if autumn has arrived early
That in spring keep flowers of any color

My life I give you
I'll sing to your heart zon zon zon
There are so many days that he marks that that
That the calendar was filled there are no weeks without your voice
My calendar is one of the two
My calendar is one of the two
