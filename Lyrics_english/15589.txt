XT4S1S LYRICS ["XT4S1S" letter]

[Verse 1]
I want to see you again
On my lips have you
Temptation elevates me
And I want to try again, eh-eh
Innocent face
But nothing obedient
I know what you have in mind
And meanwhile I want to accept, Yeah

I don't know how I got to you
Addicted I turned

[Chorus]
A crazy night (UH-HUH)
That travels through me all of Cuma and causes me (uh-juh)
Adrenaline that places and dowsenfoca (uh-juh)
Vibrates delicious, passing the mouth note (mouth, mouth)
A crazy night (Yeah, UH-Huh)
That travels through my body and causes me (uh-juh)
Adrenaline that places and blur (UH-HUH)
Vibrates delicious, passing the mouth note (mouth, mouth)

Mm, okay, let's go
