Promesa Rota Lyrics "Promesa Rota"

White moon light Like yellow jelly
It's so bright that you can catch a catch ball
Both hands wrapping George bought at Lawson
I'm waiting for you by changing my breath into roses
Only the sound of the sedan passes by
The winter was coming without knowing JP
Cashimia muffler because you can't catch a cold
Do you wear a coat? Beige or white
Walking in the city you don't know alone, lunch by the window, waiting for a night bus,
Glowing illuminations (illuminations)
Someday, it will be beautified and remain, the words will wither, and it will be blurred,
Close gate A jet that becomes smaller
Deep breatht in the kid with an Inca Cola
Cessna reservation for 2 people CHECK in counter
I don't care about the land, I don't care about the bad road
Get the distance between the two
A chance to sleep, breath, and touch on the right shoulder
If it ’s not bad, it’ s erected near you
I want to contain it before I know where the shaking thoughts are going
I want to push it into the pocket and continue traveling together

South America, which is colored at dusk at dusk,
Life synchronization and iCloud photos always laugh
Let's gently go to the side of the night when you are broken
Even if you don't say anything, let's grasp your hands

Close gate
A jet that passes through the immigration
You get smaller and smaller and disappear
See off far away, hug, cut your finger and meet again with JP
No matter how spicy and spicy parting is the same past
A guest house who turns back to an airplane bound for Narita
Taxi Luck -chan returns home at the price I got when I cut the price
Running into the bathroom and in the right hand of Misanga in the washroom mirror
Laugh only with the new guest expression that is coming today
You Might Also Like Walking in the city you don't know alone, waiting for lunch by the window, waiting for a night bus,
Glowing illuminations (illuminations)

Cold Georgia thrown away empty can "Umbrella that someone has forgotten"
Look in front of you, not to look anywhere
I tried to put my iPhone in my right pocket
I thought a little and put it in my bag

Someday, it will be beautified and remain, the words will wither, and it will be blurred,
Close gate A jet that becomes smaller
