I'M Your Little Mamacita (-Cita)
You do everything I say, Yeah
If you are with me just command me, Yeah
Here is not how and when you ask

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Command, here I send
If you want with me, go getting accustoming (Yeah-Yeah, huh)
So many are looking for me
And if you don't like it, another is calling
