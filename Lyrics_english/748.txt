Tarzan from the jungle lyrics [letter of "tarzan of the jungle"]

[Enter: Standly & Jon Z]
Yeah
Ah yeah
Give him, Mommy, Guaya
I like natural, but the same
I can operate
Let yourself go, my baby (UH-UH)
How rich he wamo 'to pass
[Pre-Caro: Standly]
I will be the jungle tarzan
Move it as a snake
I don't run with zebra ', my hand disintegrates you
I am quiet, I don't care if they speak shit (no, no)
At calm, that the world is going to turn (hahaha)
That I had to look for it (RRR)
And I met a brunette cinnamon skin
Dance 'in the tube, hard, give him, mommy, as you already know'

[Chorus: jon z & standly]
I like natural, but the same (UH)
I can operate
Let go, my baby (uh)
How rich he wamo 'to pass
I like natural (wuh), pеro the same
I can operate
Let yourself go, my baby (Jon Z, men)
How rich he wamo 'to pass

[Verse 1: jon z]
Your lips I want (ah), kiss (ah)
I want to know if it's true '(ha!)
If with me (Yih-Ih!) You are '(Yah!)
On the way it goes to me (Yah)
And I will be 'alone', with me he was guided (haha!)
And Toa 'La' Amiga 'for me he canceled them (Yi)
I'm just his friend, he doesn't have a boyfriend (Nah!)
A little princess escapes' del Castillo (Krr)
She likes the jacuzzi, does not fall in love, you yes
Pussy juice, the blusi is removed (pa!)
It makes me a rusi, that dog is put on (Wuh!)
Juicy, that booty is mine exclusive

A bottle to drink it, the pear does not tremble (for)
Being the owner of the gate, I slide like skate
The Meo on Empire State Street
Even playing play turns', all oky (ha)
I will look for it to deserve to be the king
I want a Bandida cat (AH-AH-AH)
Tell me that I only laugh (ah-ah-ah)
That worries and talk to me to '' day '(day')
Pa 'that comes to cheer my life (life)
Pa 'that she loves me even though this
A crazy life with you I want (I know what you want ')
And another topic that wets the whole panty
A lot of money, pa 'miami tapiza'o in leather
