The missing Lyrics [intro]
I prefer...
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault

[Verse 1]
If there is any man who loves me
Sepal! It was the one who made me
No longer touch any
I did not touch, they are all the same
All women who love me
Take my hand!
Mind-emotional woman
So sentimental
Without love, meaning ends
Your street is the same as my sidewalk, nice
I forget what there could be and have not
Submit, I want! A trick, envy!
The ease in this trick
To change love as if it were a mameluco, baby
Creature, Nenuco, to put only one item, man locked you
I don't care I just want your bite
I don't take it with soda I take it with a peak
I do not pee like the one with fire
If you taught me the fire, fire!
You know I love you so much
That we are what dripped, but asshole
I leave that for what I complain so much, I move away
Disappear is our complex, it hurts.
He has put the red of our love, he has become old
It is no longer a hug, that is just a reflection, which we are far from
That charm, where do we leave it?
That song, why don't we sing it?
I prefer
[Chorus]
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault

[Verse 2]
There was a story that we never tell
From so much come and go now we disenchant us
That's why I duel, I bring it to flight
Then still flight and come back
Without having gotten up I am again, Sara He!
Know how I move
And the combo is that I move
Then I dare without a clover of luck
Without revoling my threat, yes
Without approaching death
Without eliminating melodies
Without killing more noon
He gave me days of happiness
Maybe, maybe if you thought, you wouldn't hate me
But hate is a weapon to assemble and disassemble
I think there are not so many people to love
I would love you
My love what else I would like
But it was what happened
Wanting the rain
I died cold and resurrected wishing the sun
I waste time if I wait for you
Despair if you leave, but
I keep Marina and Consuelo
I can step on without soil
Love, does not reach the salary
That is the bad, this is the good
If you like it well and if you don't like it, Bue!

I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault

[Verse 3]
I get out of classifications
Shots, dramatized love, rhymes in fictions
True phrases, see
Your life what do you think
We know that the plant does not grow
The orchards decrease and grow
Inflation in my Argentina, nation
Heart, heart
There are no culprits for that
I do not ask forgiveness

[Chorus]
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
[Outro]
I prefer, oh!
I prefer plastic pots at my table
Of telgopor light
I have for the doubts the phone on if you call
To tell me that you love me
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault
I prefer the fault, the fault, the fault
I prefer the fault
The lack
The foulbed
