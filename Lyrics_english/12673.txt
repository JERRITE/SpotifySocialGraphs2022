Kitchen Song Lyrics[Intro]
(La-da-di, da-di, da-di, da-di, da-do)
(Than just givin' you my love)

[Verse 1]
If you're goin' to the kitchen
Leave the door ajar a crack
'Cause I just wanna keep on listenin'
And I can't wait until you're back
God, I love it when you're near me
I love the lines around your eyes
And all at once, I see it clearly
And I'll spend a lifetime by your side
[Chorus]
And I'll give you all my love
I'll give you all my love
Ain't no symphony, no VIP, there ain't no sweeter drug
Than just givin' you my love

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, and four
Quick, come kiss me at the door
I don't need a lot when we got flowers at the store
Hey-hey-hey, so let your castle take my pawn
Let the dogs out on the lawn
And I will write you kitchen songs (One, two, three!)

[Chorus]
And I'll give you all my love
I'll give you all my love (All my love)
Ain't no symphony, no VIP, there ain't no sweeter drug
Than just givin' you my love

[Outro]
(La-da-di, da-di, da-di, da-di, da-do)
Than just givin' you my love
(La-da-di, da-di, da-di, da-di, da-do)
Than just givin' you my love
La-da-di, da-di, da-di, da-di, da-do
Than just givin' you my loveYou might also like2Embed
