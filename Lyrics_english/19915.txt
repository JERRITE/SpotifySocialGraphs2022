Hollywood Dropout Lyrics[Hook]
Only one thing can make my heart beat faster than it's supposed to
Back of the club she could never live with half of the shit, that I live through
It means nothing to me and it means nothing to you
I just pray that you pull through
I'm not young enough to cry I'm not old enough to fold I could try a million times till my hearts still cold (Mackned)

[Verse]
I wanna be a patriotic fuck boi
Tote guns pop pills have fun boi
I woke up sick but I know how to fix it
I know you want a piece but I ain't tryna split it
Don't try to hide it we know you addicted
My doctor is my nigga I don't need prescriptions
Everything you sacrifice I never cherish
I remember when you use to love me
I was lying to myself, I was lying to myself
I was lying in my bed
I was lying to myself (Yeah)
I was lying to mom
I was lying to myself, I was lying to myself
They told me slow down but I can't
Before I finally catch some sleep I contemplate
I'm alone inside a tour bus
From the bottom lifting up a [?]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm really slaving but it look like fun
Never enough no it's never enough
Woke up [?]
Rock the same clique till my soul shake
[?] whip the Audi like im tryna shave
GothBoiClique, GothBoiClique, baby
Glock 45, I'm let the toy rip
GothBoiClique, GothBoiClique
Make em sacrifice they bitch and be okay with it
GBC forever, GBC forever
I feel like me and my brothers are never together
GBC forever, GBC forever
I feel like me and my brothers are never together
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel like me and my brothers are never together
[Hook]
Only one thing can make my heart beat faster than it's supposed to
Back of the club she could never live with half of the shit, that I live through
It means nothing to me and it means nothing to you
I just pray that you pull through
I'm not young enough to cry I'm not old enough to fold I could try a million times till my hearts still cold (Mackned)You might also likeEmbed
