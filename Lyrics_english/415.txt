Gucci Flow Lyrics[Intro: Finesse2Tymes]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Finesse
Two of 'em

[Verse 1: Finesse2Tymes & Gucci Mane]
A million dollars don't excite me (At all)
Model bitches can't entice me (At all)
Still a street nigga, white jumpsuit, black Glock, dirty white Nikes (I'm street)
Still'll put them things in a rental (Finesse 'em)
Crack his head down the middle (I got 'em)
And I'm certified everywhere I go (Go), I don't need a vouch, I'm official (I'm him)
They wanna stop me like Jeffrey Simmons (Jeffrey Simmons)
I'm from Memphis, I grew up and walked to Simmons (Eastside)
If you ain't from the block, you the opposition (Opposition)
If you wasn't sellin' dope, you was killin', pimpin' (Pimp)
Robbin', stealin' (Rob)
Whatever to get it, just get it (Just get it)
It ain't just on me, it's in me (In me)
I speak the truth, I'm a realist (A realist)
I ain't just dedicated, I'm committed (Committed)
Pull up, white Polo tee, Palm Angels sweats
VVS baguettes, they knew I was next
Locked down twenty-three hours, one hour wrecked
Look at me now, everything together (Everything)
If I changed, I changed for the better
Everybody wanna shine with me, but we ain't stayin' in the rain together
Can't hang together (Go)
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci finessin', these niggas regressin'
Call me a clone, but I call it progressin' (Well, damn)
I went to jail and it taught me a lesson
I took a bird and turned it to a blessin'
Wop got a fetish for chasin' the lettuce
She tryna finesse me to get some baguettes (Ho)
Niggas pathetic, diss me and regret it
I took the cash and let them take the credit (Wow)
Life is hectic, keep it kosher steady, don't need no medic (Woo)
Lost in Vegas, I ain't sweated, picked up a bag and I ain't bet it (No)
My niggas rich with millions, but we felons
Your niggas did the killings, but they tellin' (Pussy)
Every time I hit the county, I was sellin'
Brother front the pack, I was seven (True)
Matter of fact, I was in the seven
J's showin' love, call me Kevin
Forgive me, Lord, I really need a reverend (Huh)
Play with Wop, you're on your way to heaven (Lord)
Gucci pulled up in a 911 (Skrrt)
Raisin' terror like it's 9/11 (Mmm)
Took a nigga weapon without a weapon (Wow)
He screamin' "Help," but knowin' they can't help him (It's Gucci)You might also likeEmbed
