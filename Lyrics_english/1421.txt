1 Day 2 Nights Lyrics[Intro]
I just wanna go dum dada dum all night
Wanna watch you go dum dum dada dum all night

[Verse 1]
When I saw you, that was it
I was all in before the kiss
Like a comet, what it is
No, I'm not prepared for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, please
Don't say that I'm drunk on a dream
Oh-oh, ooh-woah
[Chorus]
It's been one day and two nights, I don't wanna go home
Now it's too late for goodbyes, you're the one that I want
And in the dark, you're my highlight
Even though it's been one day and only two nights

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna go dum dada dum all night
Wanna watch you go dum dum dada dum all night
Love it when we go dum dada dum all night
Even though it's been one day and only two nights

[Verse 2]
Like a summer in the sky
Yeah, you look like paradise
What's your number, what's the vibe?
Can we just lose track of time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, please
Don't say that I'm drunk on a dream
Ooh ah

[Chorus]
It's been onе day and two nights, I don't wanna go home
Now it's too late for goodbyes, you'rе the one that I want
And in the dark, you're my highlight
Even though it's been one day and only two nights
You might also like[Post-Chorus]

Wanna watch you go dum dum dada dum all night
Love it when we go dum dada dum all night
Even though it's been one day and only two nights

[Bridge]
I just wanna go dum dada dum all night
Wanna watch you go dum dum dada dum all night
I just wanna go dum dada dum all night
Wanna watch you go dum dum dada dum all night

[Chorus]
It's been one day and two nights, I don't wanna go home
Now it's too late for goodbyes, you're the one that I want
And in the dark, you're my highlight
Even though it's been one day and only two nights

[Outro]
