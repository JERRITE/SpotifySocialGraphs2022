Dr. Psychiatrist Lyrics [lyrics by "Dr. Psychiatrist"]

[Verse 1]
I think it's time to go with the psychiatrist
They told him at home and brought me almost to trail
Well, when I arrive at night
And they want to make me reproach
I don't hear anything, I don't hear anything and run to the window
But from the fifth floor the one who jumps
I get violent, avoided house ornaments
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy
I'm just desperate
[Chorus]
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
Don't tell me nonsense
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I want to live my own life
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I will not pay the account
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I no longer mi-, I no longer mi-
I don't look at my legs anymore
Nope! Nope! No no no no no!
I am not crazy!

[Verse 2]
I think it's time to go with the psychiatrist
That said the professor and ran from the room
And when I don't get to classes
Command to look for me everywhere
I hide, I hide; I do not understand what happens
First that I leave and after it does not come out
Four sad walls, prison in love
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy
I'm just desperate

[Chorus]
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
Don't tell me nonsense
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I want to live my own life
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I will not pay the account
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I no longer mi-, I no longer mi-
I don't look at my legs anymore
Nope! Nope! No no no no no!
I am not crazy!

And in full moon
I become wolf
And I'm looking for Romeo
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy
I'm just desperate

[Chorus]
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
Don't tell me nonsense
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I want to live my own life
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I will not pay the account
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I no longer mi-, I no longer mi-
I don't look at my legs anymore
Nope! Nope! No no no no no!

[Chorus]
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
Don't tell me nonsense
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I want to live my own life
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I will not pay the account
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I no longer mi-, I no longer mi-
I don't look at my legs anymore
Nope! Nope! No no no no no!
[Chorus]
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
Don't tell me nonsense
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I want to live my own life
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I will not pay the account
(Psychiatrist Doctor)
I no longer mi-, I no longer mi-
I don't look at my legs anymore
Nope! Nope! No no no no no!
I'm not crazy! Embed
