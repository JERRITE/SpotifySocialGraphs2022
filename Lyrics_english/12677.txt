Baby Youâ€™re a Haunted House Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

[Verse 1]
And your heart will stay forever
When your last remains are few
In the dark, we dance together
And I'd like to be waiting with you
[Chorus]
Oh, baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

[Verse 2]
And the nights, they last forever
And days are always making you blue
In the dark, we laugh together
'Cause the misery's funny to you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

[Bridge]
I'll be the only one who likes the things you do
I'll be the ghost inside your head when we are through
Sometimes you scare me, but I come around to you
I'll say hello, hello, (hello)
And I'll find a way to scare you too

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh, baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now
You might also likeOh, baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
You better go and take a bow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house
Baby, you're a haunted house
Baby, you're a haunted house, now18Embed
