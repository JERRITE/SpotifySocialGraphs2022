[Intro]
I want to know what I am for you
Because whenever I don't 'see I forgot to say

[Pre-stribe]
I am very confused, your 'kisses are more cold
And I begin to believe that I am one more 'of your friends
I always walk in nothing, it is night and it doesn't call
"Better tomorrow" tells me, which already has another 'plans
[Chorus]
And I hoped to be the first (OH)
Your plan A, not the third (OH)
But this way 'far
To feel the same, it is always the same
I hoped to be the first (OH)
Your plan A, not the third (OH)
But this way 'far
To feel the same, it is always the same

[Verse]
I waited at least
An indication to see how we do (plo, plo, plo)
If I must stay close or more 'far
Because now kisses' fast and before it was slow (oh)
I don't understand it anymore, 'to get lost (I lose)
In that 'nights when I smoke and drink
It seems that I am a zombie, I walk half a dead
Pass I try to understand you
And I don't understand you, what is my position?
If I go first (OH) or go third (OH)
I don't understand you, what is my position?
If I go first (OH) or go third (OH)

[Pre-stribe]
I am very confused, your 'kisses are more cold
And I begin to believe that I am one more 'of your friends
I always walk in nothing, it is night and it doesn't call
He tells me "better tomorrow", which already has other planet '

To feel the same, it is always the same
