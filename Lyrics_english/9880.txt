Gang Shit No Lame Shit Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
RamyOnTheBeat

[Chorus]
Soon as I walk through the door, uh (Walk through the door)
Designer, it's head to toe, yeah
Young nigga all 'bout his dough, uh (Yeah, yeah)
My nigga, come get your ho, yeah (Bitch)
Paid cash, I don't have a note, uh (I don't have a note)
Hell yeah, I want me a Rolls, Wraith
Spent twenty racks on my rose chain
These niggas hatin' is so lame
[Verse 1]
I'm ballin', need Rogane
Hop out the drop, smokin' propane (Yeah)
I do my damn thing
Boy, you ain't nothin' but a damn shame
Smashin' your bitch, yeah, your main thing
Come get your ho off my ding-a-ling
Poof on the bitch just like David Blaine
Balenci runners, no shoe strings
I drip so much sauce, I done left a stain
You get the picture without the frame
I pull out the pistol, I bet that I bang
Play hot potato with his motherfuckin' brain
I shoot to kill so you know I got aim
You just a Shitzu and I'm a Great Dane
You know I get to the cream with my gang
We Paper Route, it is not Wu-Tang

[Chorus]
Soon as I walk through the door, uh (Bitch)
Designer, it's head to toe, yeah
Young nigga all 'bout his dough, uh (Yeah, yeah)
My nigga, come get your ho, yeah (Come get your bitch)
Paid cash, I don't have a note, uh (I don't have a note)
Hell yeah, I want me a Rolls, Wraith
Spent twenty racks on my rose chain (Rose gold)
These niggas hatin' is so lame

Hop in the foreign to change lanes (Hop in the)
Young nigga fly as a damn plane (Fly as a)
Walk in, the hoes go insane (Yeah)
Ice on my Patek, my wrist sprained (Ice)
I'm rich, bitch, Glock Rick James (I'm rich)
Cuttin' these checks like sensei (Cut)
And that shit like every day (Yeah)
If I ain't gettin' paid then I'm gettin' laid (Yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, told bitch1Embed
