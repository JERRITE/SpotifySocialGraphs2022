The Hate Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a match, you're dynamite
An open flame to your gasoline
My peddled flower, my finest hour
You're the razor blade that I need
The heart's wish within my dreams
A nightmare the likes I've never seen

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, me and you
My life
Me and you, you and I
I wonder why
[Chorus]
You are so beautiful
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate you
I hate you

[Verse 2]
Forever ain't long enough
Your hand in mine, the thought chills my spine
I'd walk through hell just to get to you
And wonder why every single time (Every time)
You're the light within my eyes
When I'm with you I want to die (Your love's a lie)

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, me and you
My life
Me and you, you and I
I wonder why

[Chorus]
You are so beautiful
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate you
You might also like[Chorus]
You are so beautiful
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate you

[Bridge]
I cannot let it go (Let it go)
The pain you left inside of me
I cannot let it go (Let it go)
The pain your name brings me
I cannot let it go (Let it go)
I have to let you go
Let you go, let you, let you go

[Verse 3]
I'm your match, you're my dynamite
I'm the flame to your gasoline
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're the reason that I love goodbyes
Goodbye

[Chorus]
You are so beautiful
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate you
[Chorus/Outro]
You are so beautiful (Beautiful)
So I wrote you this lovely little hate song
Our love is so true (Me and you)
I wrote this love song to let you know I hate youEmbed
