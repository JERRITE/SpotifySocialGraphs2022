Golden Haze LyricsWild heart surrender to me
What does it take to be like you?
Golden haze, hold out for days
Haven't seen you, haven't seen anyone

Beautiful one
I wanna know what you are
Beautiful one
I wanna go where you are

Wild heart surrender to me
What does it take to be like you?
Golden haze, hold out for days
Haven't seen you, haven't seen anyone
Beautiful one
I wanna know what you are
Beautiful one
I wanna go where you areYou might also like2Embed
