Lyrics loves [Lyrics for "Bad de Amores" ft. The ghetto]

[Intro: from the ghetto, The Rudeboyz]
Sibiriba-Ba, Chubiri-Uoh
RUDEBOYZ (UH)
This is from G with Mario B
This is for you, You My Baby

[Pre-Caro: Mario Bautista, De la Ghetto]
How do you intend to return and fall again (mmm, no, no, no)
When not a word I believe you (Yeah)
I don't want your tangles (I believed you ')
And let me tell you
That now it is you who is sad
Baby, you already lost time
Go where you came, Yeh
[Choir: Mario Bautista, De la Ghetto]
And I don't need discussions (uohh)
I don't want to know about love evil
All false illusions (-sions) are over
You don't exist already, you left

And I don't need discussions (-sions)
I don't want to know about love evil (love)
All false illusions (illusions) are over (illusions)
You don't exist already, you left

[Verse 1: Mario Bautista]
Everything has changed, I don't want this love for a little
If I am clear is that I don't need you
I insist that single is richer
Now in the D.F. Jangueando with the chulitos

Do not call anymore, there are no agreements, there are no negotiations
It's not worth talking about love
Remember that I climbed you
I treated you like none (I lowered the moon)
So many opportunities that I gave you, you didn't take advantage of a
(You didn't take advantage of one, girl)

[Choir: Mario Bautista, De la Ghetto]
And I don't need discussions (-sions)
I don't want to know about love evil (love)
All false illusions (illusions) are over (illusions)
You don't exist already, you left
You Might Also Likey I don't need discussions (uohh)
I don't want to know about love evil (Yeah-Yeah)
All false illusions (-sions) are over
You don't exist already, you left

[Bridge: De la Ghetto]
You were the one who called her turned off, Baby (turned off)
And now this game is not in your favor (your favor, of the Geezy)

[Verse 2: from the ghetto]
For the most they treat (OH)
I care how they treat me (okay)
I will continue playing to the bases (Yeh)
Now it suits you (Yeah)
But this afternoon and you don't have me (uh-hey)
The bad thing you wanted does not love you (ahh)

Your falsehood wrapped me (UHH)
Now everything ended
Thinking that I was the worst
Thanks to you 'toy better
Do not call anymore, there are no agreements, there are no negotiations (UH-YEH)
It is not worth it (no, no) that we continue talking about love

[Choir: Mario Bautista, De la Ghetto]
And I don't need discussions (Ouhh)
I don't want to know about love evil
All false illusions (-sions) are over
You don't exist already, you left
And I don't need discussions (-sions)
I don't want to know about love evil (love)
All false illusions (illusions) are over (illusions)
You don't exist already, you left

[Bridge: Mario Bautista]
How do you intend to return and fall again
When not a word I believe you
I don't want your tangles
