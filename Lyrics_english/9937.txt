Going Through Some Thangs Lyrics[Intro]
All this shit I been goin' through man
Make a nigga want to put a spliff in the air
Crazy thing about it, I don't even smoke

[Chorus]
I just wanna (Blow), light one and (Just roll)
Been goin' through some things and I just wanna clear my brain
These niggas do the (Most), and these hoes gon' be (Hoes)
These bitches change up on you, and them niggas do the same
I been goin' through some things
And don't nobody understand me man, not even family man
I been goin' through some things
Hopin' all this shit change 'fore a nigga go insane
I been goin' through some things
[Verse 1]
Hey, damn right
Nigga grind hard to get my fam right
Shit'd be easy, we gon' plan lie
I would've been living in the glam light, hey
Sometimes I'm like damn life
But me givin' up, that don't sound right
So I keep my head up and watch the ground light
'Cause the niggas plottin' on me want me down right
Hey, doin' bad
Why the fuck you want to see me doin' bad?
Bitch I'm dealin' with my own problems
I ain't tryna argue with your stupid ass
From sun to sun I'm tryna get some money
And stuff some hundreds in a Louis bag
And you started fussing, throwing fits and cussing
No time to be fuckin' with your foolish ass (With your dumb ass ho)
Old English bitch, already with the in they feelings shit
I been bumpin' heads with these knuckleheads
Gettin' in to it on some silly shit
And some of my closest niggas actin' like women, what's up with this?
I don't owe a motherfucker nothin', I been hustled, tryna get rich
Niggas feel like I don't fuck with 'em
My bitch feel she don't make me happy 'nough
Say look, I'm just one man, doin' all I can, give me a chance, fuck
And nigga if I ain't really fuck with you I wouldn't fuck with you
No ifs, ands, or buts
I ain't never show my fuckin' feelings
Nigga we already know what's up
You might also like[Interlude]
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin' 'nother man
Always some shit comin' up, poppin' up man
Like the devil keep on throwin' the sticks at me but I ain't gon' trip though
Keep my calm, progress, that's all I can do

[Chorus]
I just wanna (Blow), light one and (Just roll)
Been goin' through some things and I just wanna clear my brain
These niggas do the (Most), and these hoes gon' be (Hoes)
These bitches change up on you, and them niggas do the same
I been goin' through some things
And don't nobody understand me man, not even family man
I been goin' through some things
Hopin' all this shit change 'fore a nigga go insane
I been goin' through some things

[Verse 2]
Hey, niggas told me to be a pimp
Really I ain't even got the patience for it
I already got trust issues, ho get some stitches out my paper boy
Always been a fly nigga, stackin' paper like a paperboy
I guess this why niggas hate on me
'Cause me and my niggas been makin' noise
My team lady been havin' problems, so you know I had to step in
On top of that I been takin' losses, this where the real shit kick in
This shit too much for one nigga, reality just set in
Niggas owe more money than I demand runnin'
But them bills comin', send that check in
[Chorus]
I just wanna (Blow), light one and (Just roll)
Been goin' through some things and I just wanna clear my brain
These niggas do the (Most), and these hoes gon' be (Hoes)
These bitches change up on you, and them niggas do the same
I been goin' through some things
And don't nobody understand me man, not even family can
I been goin' through some things
Hopin' all this shit change 'fore a nigga go insane
I been goin' through some things

[Outro]
It's too much for one nigga, one nigga to deal with, ayy
It's too much for one nigga, one nigga to deal with
It's too much for one nigga, one nigga to deal with
It's too much for one nigga, one nigga to deal with1Embed
