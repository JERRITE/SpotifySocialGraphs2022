Translationsenglishveleno 6 Lyrics [text of "poison 6" ft. Gemitaiz]

[Intro]
Mixer t, cì

[Verse 1: Gemitaiz]
It is the Gemitaiz you answer again: "What are you?" (Eh)
I still have a little po 'de poison for you (eh)
Points to skyscrapers like the bad boy (eh)
Flow Makaveli, drop with match point (uh)
My flow for you is torture (ah)
You can bring those who seem so hard you (Hah)
Out Bianchi inside Negri as in Honduras (Oh)
We do it as long as we crash with the tour bus (uh)
When I enter the base these still that look at me (Uh)
They are not capable therefore shouting at the scandal (uh)
On the slow bases I vandal
Remember I'm a jordan, you are a sandal (hah)
With two hectors I become E.T.
Under mushrooms, if you allow me (ah)
I put the padlocks above the verses (eh)
Only if you stop you do it happy (ah-ah)
Check it, check it, friar ', let me try (hah)
Spit twenty verses with the particular flow (Hah)
So if you feel them I can make you fly (Hah)
Pump these, go out and give up the others, it appears (eh!)
I put the ball in the hole
I have the number nine as Batistuta
My people talk about shit because he lived it
For this reason when my every one of mine spits you
*spit*
Increase the power supply, the power supply takes fire
Who invented stories the spit in slow motion (ah)
Every six words I depend on you like methadone
Half man half a clone, I do the seranton
Under the sign of the dragon I write new bars every evening
That to make them take the time that the planet dies (eh)
Friar ', of' sta shit they just elected me senator (eh)
Friar ', of' sta shit they just elected me emperor (aah)
When Monto (Uh)
It seems to be in another world (eh)
And think I don't do it very much
I send them all home until the bottom scratch (Hah)
Flow Killer, Drug Dealer
Don't think I finish, I have a thousand (eh)
No machines (no), no villas (no)
What do you think I signed with Skrillex?
We are a lot of stuff (a lot of stuff)
The triangle
A.K.A. The other artists cry (Hah, sorry)
Dani, do you know how many records are missing? (Uh)
I take a boat
With three grams slipped into the shoe (Hah)
I am with my brothers who light it at dawn
I don't like the road because I come from there, between '
(Hello, Fra ')
[Verse 2: madman]
The techniques you are looking for? Hello
If I make a piece above the Boom-Chai to report
You burn you that I split (eh)
Even if the pronunciation is wrong (eh)
M a blow of Mauser, you a taser
How many bars you do (eh)
I recommend the breaks, cry in every single
You look like you have Münchhausen's syndrome (Uah)
The rhymes you are looking for the spit, the archive (eh)
Get shit when rappi in the studio and live (eh-eh)
If I turn me back, I am vindictive (YE)
Living Dead, Mad The Vampire (RRH)
Back from death, from Caronte
Salt from the catacombs, scale the mountain
Your brus brishes strong, barrier barrels
Because he knows that my flow is a Colt and slits Calotte (Brr)
I push too much until double the sound
I smoke the opium and close your eyes, Hiroshima (ah)
Excavation Tombe Type L'etna, I get on the top
Vietnam type bomb release, Indochina (BUM)
Scemo learns the apprenticeship, internship
They copy us with handcuffs, type China (ah)
We eat you like the m & m's
M and Gem are type Rei and Kenhiro, you Shiro and Mila (hello)
No I don't finish
Otherwise these say I don't feel like they do like that girl
Who does not say that it is a slut then my balls swallow
Like ravioli because it says yes as Valsoia
When I swallow them while Guido I put the second
She who indulges me, becomes like a sequoia
While I drink cognac, fuck what a shame
From half an hour round to 'sta rounds
Each bar is a Putin's ballistic missile (UH)
I have physical, quantum style, you close you (uh)
To redo it even if it is impossible, I have seen tributes (YE)
Rappo for another twenty minutes (no)
Metally autistic, avant -garde (eh)
I did the scientific, not the artistic (eh)
I'm with Labadini, swollen Napapijiri (Vai)
Davide is from there that he turns papyrus
(Do we turn it on?)
Okay, Okay (we turn it on)
Hood in the room
We fix the ganja that we paralyze
The bad face, we grind
The trace in pieces, look who we are
I don't look at the friar prices' we buy
Four more pieces from Pakistani (Uh-Uh-Uh)
We overturn our eyes on the contrary
That we beat you is lapalissian (eh)
I'm a thousand, look at me that I burn the papillae (seh)
On the basis not delay, serial killer (ah)
I want to demolish, what should I tell you? (Seh)
I just want to die at the Antilles (Seh)
I don't want to be satisfied
Rappo type blade to welcome
Each bar is my lady to contemplate
From tomorrow Ramadan, I have too many it seems
Fra ', I have Madama who is ready to enter
(It seems)
