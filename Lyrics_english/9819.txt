Chase Down Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil Bean]
And they say they want the old me
Closest thing to Mike, bitch, I'm Kobe
Niggas with this telling, don't condone it
Pressure, then I'm on it
I just copped some ice, yeah, it's frozen
Empty out them Glocks then reload 'em
This shit made me a believer
I'm just trying to live, this shit evil
I'm just trying to do this for my people
They say this that ether
Nigga think he hot, we could freeze him
Bitch, it's Nike Dunks and the razors
[Bridge: ZayBang]
We don't tolerate no ho shit
And if them people ask them questions, we don't know shit
Nigga, chase downs, head shots, nigga, walk ups (Baow, baow)
I heard them niggas getting (Baow, boaw, baow)
Nigga (Baow, baow)

[Chorus: ZayBang]
Nigga, high speeds, we don't stop, fuck the one time (Fuck the one time)
On billboards with the mafia like Shoreline (Nigga)
Boss hoes, shake something if the rent paid (Bitch)
Ask niggas, I've been turnt since the sixth grade (Nigga)
Chase downs, head shots, nigga, walk ups (Ha-ha)
I heard them niggas speaking down, nigga, talk up
The ho shit (Ha), we don't tolerate no ho shit (We don't tolerate it)
And if them people ask them questions, we don't know shit (We don't know nothing, nigga)

[Verse 2: Lil Yee]
Ask 'em, I can get you gone, I ain't capping
Rapping, wipe a nigga nose with a napkin
Bad bitch, Christian Dior for my fashion
Already know how I do it, nigga
Ayy, make her pussy talk, send my niggas pics up in jail
Make the pussy talk and I might buy you some Chanel or CELINE
Have you riding 'round in the beam, I'm the G.O.A.T. 
You can ask my lil' bruh Bean
You might also like[Chorus: ZayBang]
Nigga, high speeds, we don't stop, fuck the one time (Fuck the one time)
On billboards with the mafia like Shoreline (Nigga)
Boss hoes, shake something if the rent paid (Bitch)
Ask niggas, I've been turnt since the sixth grade (Nigga)
Chase downs, head shots, nigga, walk ups (Ha-ha)
I heard them niggas speaking down, nigga, talk up
The ho shit (Ha), we don't tolerate no ho shit (We don't tolerate it)
And if them people ask them questions, we don't know shit (We don't know nothing, nigga)

[Verse 3: ZayBang]
Shake something, where them hoes that be bossed up?
And tell 'em if it ain't no money, you ain't lost nothing
High speed, we don't stop, this the fast jawn
I got this bitch shaking ass 'cause my bag long
Bitch-made, we ain't fighting, we don't give fades
It's street smart and I've been turnt since the sixth grade
Bitch, please, give me head, bitch, strip tease
These some Chanels on my feet, nigga, big C's

[Verse 4: KxNG LLAMA]
Uh, we tied in, so we stuck, nigga
Ain't no capping in my rap, I bust niggas
Nigga thinking he the shit, we'll flush niggas
That revolver up close, it's a must, nigga
Ayy, who the fuck is you? I think we know, blood
My shooter coked out, point him out, he'll go, blood
Yeah, when my slime sneeze, he gon' catch something
I told him wipe you down, guarantee he gon' whack something
[Chorus: ZayBang]
Nigga, high speeds, we don't stop, fuck the one time (Fuck the one time)
On billboards with the mafia like Shoreline (Nigga)
Boss hoes, shake something if the rent paid (Bitch)
Ask niggas, I've been turnt since the sixth grade (Nigga)
Chase downs, head shots, nigga, walk ups (Ha-ha)
I heard them niggas speaking down, nigga, talk up
The ho shit (Ha), we don't tolerate no ho shit (We don't tolerate it)
And if them people ask them questions, we don't know shit (We don't know nothing, nigga)Embed
