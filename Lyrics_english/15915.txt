It is not Lyricslo obsession to follow all your footprints
At each party and at school
It is because you have around my heart

The graffitti of your house
Where I put who loves you
I know it was very bad stitch
I apologize

And is that I never pee (or with my eyes)
Nor turn (keep the distance)
In good plan I give you my word
I just want to talk
I swear that this is not obsession
Try to meet me even just one day
It is not obsession
You could find love to your measure

It is not obsession
I want to go with you the night that you say
It is not obsession
You could find love to your measure

The poem in your window with my orange lipstick
It's because I'm in love and I don't know what to do

To take serenade every weekend
It is because I hope to see you again

And is that I never pee (or with my eyes)
Nor turn (keep the distance)
In good plan I give you my word
I just want to talk

I swear that this is not obsession
Try to meet me even just one day
It is not obsession
You could find love to your measure
You Might Also Likeno is obsession
I want to go with you the night that you say
It is not obsession
You could find your love to your measurembed
