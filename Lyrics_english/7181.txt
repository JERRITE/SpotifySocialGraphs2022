​we don’t know a thing Lyrics[Chorus: Ivri]
We don't know a thing, we're just floatin'
Playing make believe on our own and
Waking from a dream I can't remember
Saying lots of things, I'm lost in the letters

[Post-Chorus: Ivri]
I know I'll see the world some day
Before our skin deteriorates
Before this place goes up in flames
You're in my dreams, I'm not awake
[Verse: Souly Had]
Yeah, you're so cold lately, do you bleed blue?
Why you cut me off when I need you?
Overwhelmed whenever I see you
Something's off, likе what the fuck is wrong?
What's it feel like just to feel alive?
Baby, I can't hidе, I'll just run
Falling apart
Wait 'til I wake up

[Chorus: Ivri]
We don't know a thing, we're just floatin'
Playing make believe on our own and
Waking from a dream I can't remember
Saying lots of things, I'm lost in the letters

[Post-Chorus: Ivri]
I know I'll find the words to say
Before our skin deteriorates
Before this place goes up in flames
You're in my dreams, just go awayYou might also like1Embed
