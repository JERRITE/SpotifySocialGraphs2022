Gummy (feat. Tessa Violet) Lyrics[Chorus: Tessa Violet]
She look just like a gummy bear, uh
She look just like a gummy bear do
She's sweet just like a gummy bear too

[Verse 1: Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet]
Got it
She rock it
She keep it in the pocket
Man I’m never falling out of time
Her beauty and her drive
A hundred fifty mile per hour
She likes cardigans and skirts
And she knows just what she's worth
Though she never know the words
She's a hummingbird alright
(Do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Pre-Chorus: Will Joseph Cook]
The kind of girl that makes you late
In the morning when you lazy lay
And sends a picture just to say
’Hi-hi, baby, bye-bye!'

[Chorus: Tessa Violet, Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet]
She look just like a gummy bear, uh
She look just like a gummy bear do
She's sweet just like a gummy bear too (So sweet, so sweet)
A gummy bear

[Post-Chorus: Will Joseph Cook, Tessa Violet, Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet]
Take me higher (So sweet, so sweet)
Life is but a dream
Wake me up on Monday
Do it gently

[Verse 2: Tessa Violet & Will Joseph Cook]
While she moves
She got me in the groove
Dancing all around my mind
She only shoot colour
Miss her with the black and white
She gets sushi Friday nights
Yeah, she knows just what she likes
When we're chillin' in my car
Her hands are never far away
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

The kind of girl that makes you late
In the morning when you lazy lay
And sends a picture just to say
"Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye!"

[Chorus: Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet, Tessa Violet, Will Joseph Cook]
She look just like a gummy bear, uh
She look just like a gummy bear do
She's sweet just like a gummy bear too (Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye!)
A gummy bear

[Post-Chorus: Will Joseph Cook, Tessa Violet, Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet]
Take me higher (So sweet, so sweet)
Life is but a dream
Wake me up on Monday
Do it gently

[Chorus: Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet, Tessa Violet]
She look just like a gummy bear, uh
She look just like a gummy bear do
She's sweet just like a gummy bear too (So sweet, so sweet)
A gummy bear (She look)

[Post-Chorus: Will Joseph Cook & Tessa Violet, Tessa Violet]
Take me higher (She look)
Life is but a dream (She's sweet)
(Just like a gummy bear)
Wake me up on Monday
Do it gentlyEmbed
