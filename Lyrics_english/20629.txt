Devil Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
Run and hide
It's gonna be bad tonight
'Cause here comes your devil side
It's gonna ruin me

[Verse 2]
It's almost like
Slow motion suicide
Watching your devil side
Get between you and me
[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me what I need to do
To keep myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you

[Chorus]
Still, I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you
So, tell me why I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind
But never with you

[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you?

[Verse 3]
I can't lie
But I do miss those times
We were on a high
I thought it would never end

[Verse 4]
But you and I
We've come from the same long line
Good kids with a devil side
Just going around again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me what I need to do
To get myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you
All the way down with you

[Chorus]
I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you
So tell me why, it's always your devil side
It's always your dangerous mind
It's never you

[Post-Chorus]
So who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you?

[Bridge]
So, tell me what I need to know
To make you wanna change it all
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you
All the way down with you
[Chorus]
I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life
Just for you
So, tell me why I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind
But never with you

[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you?
Who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you?

[Outro]
Who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you now that I'm gone?7Embed
