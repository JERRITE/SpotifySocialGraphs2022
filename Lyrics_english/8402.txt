Lyrics return ["Return" ft letter. Bad Bunny]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
I'm afraid to die and be born again
And that you are not there
Want to do it as I used to do it
And that you are not there
Don't be there
As always you were pa 'me (pa' me)
I know that a thousand mistakes made (I committed)
I don't know how long it can last without you
[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
And that's why he returns
That without you the same I will not be (I will not be)
'Tás with another, I already found out (I found out)
Tell me, baby, if you plan to return, Yeh, Yeh
And that's why he returns
That without you the same I will not be (I will not be)
That 'you go with another and I found out (wuh)
Tell me if I know how to do it, Yeh, Yeh, Yeh

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
What happened in the relationship and love that had me '?
I did so bastard that they seemed orgy '
I know I am still in your fantasies
'Tas with him, but you're mine
I miss Babydoll's collection
How do you look, baby
In bed getting a goal
Like Shakira and Piqué
Rosas, Champagne and Motel
You are the forbidden fruit that knows sin
And who knows how to play with my life
That's why I take any tangle '
Like a lost bullet, Yeh
In my dream I feel your body
My only enemy is time
You close your eyes and think about my name
But you realize that now there is another man
No one changes gold for copper, I was wrong
In my dream I feel your body
My only enemy is time
I opted, I saw that I won, then lost
I play the letter to recover

And that's why he returns
That without you the same I will not be (I will not be)
'Tás with another, I already found out (I found out)
Tell me, baby, if you plan to return, Yeh, Yeh (Yeh, Go)
That's why he returns
Without you, I will not be
'Tas with another and I found out
Tell me if I know how to do it, huh, eh, huh

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Yeh, Yeh
I smoke, smoke and I don't snatch (no)
They told me you already have another cat (Yeh)
I do not want whores to take the time (no)
To'as just want wallet and shoes, Yeh
You were the only one that was real, Yeh (Yeh)
The only one I can trust
Your kisses were lit
Baby, ours will never have rip (no)
You were my angelina, I was your Brad Pitt
We were team, like LeBron and D-Wade in the 'Heat
Super impossible to forget you (Yeh)
And to 'what I did' in that suite
Baby, you were really
None of these whores are genuine '(no)
They are like the Louis Vuitton Feka, made in China (made in China)
I swear to see you with another hurt me (-tima, Yeh)
I'm waiting for him to come back 'And I climb on me, yeh
[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
That's why he returns
Without you, I will not be
'Tas with another and I found out
Tell me baby if you plan to return, huh, Yeh (Go, Go)
That's why he returns
Without you, I will not be
'Tas with another and I found out
Tell me as I know how to do it, huh, eh, eh
