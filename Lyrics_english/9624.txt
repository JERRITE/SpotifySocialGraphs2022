Fixer Upper Lyrics[Intro: Bulda]
What’s the issue, dear?
Why are you holding back from such a man?

[Verse 1: Bulda, Trolls]
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
Or the grumpy way he talks?
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Weirdness of his feet?
And though we know he washes well
He always ends up sort of smelly
But you’ll never meet a fellow who’s as
Sensitive and sweet!
[Chorus: Trolls]
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper
So he’s got a few flaws
Like his peculiar brain dear
His thing with the reindeer
That’s a little outside of nature’s laws!
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper
But this we’re certain of
You can fix this fixer-upper
Up with a little bit of love!

[Dialogue: Kristoff]
Can we please just stop talking about this?
We’ve got a real, actual problem here

[Verse 2: Trolls]
I’ll say! So tell me, dear
Is it the way that he runs scared?
Or that he’s socially impaired?
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods... what?!
Are you holding back your
Fondness due to his unmanly blondness?
Or the way he covers up
That he’s the honest goods?

[Chorus: Trolls]
He’s just a bit of a fixer-upper
He’s got a couple of bugs
His isolation is confirmation
Of his desperation for human hugs
So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper
But we know what to do
The way to fix up this fixer-upper
Is to fix him up with you!

Enough! She is engaged
To someone else, okay?!

[Verse 3: Trolls]
So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper
That’s a minor thing
Her quote 'engagement' is a flex arrangement
And by the way I don’t see no ring!
So she’s a bit of a fixer-upper
Her brain’s a bit betwixt
Get the fiancé out of the way and
The whole thing will be fixed

[Bridge: Bulda]
We’re not sayin' you can change him
‘Cause people don’t really change
We’re only saying that love's a force
That's powerful and strange
People make bad choices if they’re mad
Or scared, or stressed
Throw a little love their way
(Throw a little love their way)
And you’ll bring out their best
True love brings out their best!
[Verse 4: Trolls]
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper
That’s what it’s all about!
Father!
Sister!
Brother!
We need each other
To raise us up and round us out
Everyone’s a bit of a fixer-upper
But when push comes to shove

[Dialogue: Olaf]
The only fixer-upper fixer
That can fix up a fixer-upper is

[Outro: Trolls]
True! true!
True, true, true!
Love (True love)
Love, love, love, love, love
Love! (True love!)
True...
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your troll-fully wedded husband?

[Dialogue: Anna, Trolls]
Wait, what!?
You’re getting married!
Love!6Embed
