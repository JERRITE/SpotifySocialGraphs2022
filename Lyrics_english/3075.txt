What curse Lyrics [letter of "what a curse"]

[Chorus: Sinaloense band MS de Sergio Liz치rraga]
You don't know how much love hurts
You don't know how much it hurts in the heart
Is that the effect you caused on me
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you

[Verse 1: Snoop dogg]
Every Time You Leave There Only One Thing That I Know
What's That? Baby, I miss you
Maybe that's my guilt
I'M Guilty 'Cause I Go Away A Lot
But say you want me to stay
And i won't leave, I'M here
Whenever You Say That You Need Me
If you need me, I'll Arrive, Believe me
D-O-GG, I'm your loyal puppy
Even When I Get Out, I eat right back to the yard, ah
Mommy, it hurts when you're not with me
And I am not your man, I'm still a friend
I tell you, I love you, that means, "I love you dearly '"
And Every time you gone, i'm always gon 'want you near me
Snoopy
[Chorus: Sinaloense band MS de Sergio Liz치rraga]
You don't know how much love hurts
You don't know how much it hurts in the heart
Is that the effect you caused on me
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you

[Verse 2: Snoop dogg]
What a curse, Even When i'm at home
ONLY A COUPLE HOULS BEFORE WE'RE Back On The Road
We swim in the waters of the long beach
Because tomorrow I know you be missin 'me when i'm gone
Kissin 'me in mybeep, liftin' me in my zone
'Cause You Make Me Better Than I Can Be When I'M Alone
So I see you clearly, I sing for people
But i always feel you need me when i roam
Speaking of Trips, Overseas Let's Do The Weekend
Sip on tequila, Kick Our Feet Up, Make It Our Second Home (EH)
Take it off, Make it, I Wanna See You, Love When You Nasty
Lovin 'your ass up, i'm a dog with a bone, you know

[Chorus: Sinaloense band MS de Sergio Liz치rraga]
You don't know how much love hurts
You don't know how much it hurts in the heart
Is that the effect you caused on me
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you
The curse of missing you
