Memory Lane Lyrics[Intro: Tom Grennan]
Hmm-mm
Hmm-mm
Hmm-mm

[Hook 1: Bugzy Malone]
Yeah
Today is gonna be the day
That they throw it all back to you
And by now
You should have somehow realised what you have to do
The world keeps on turning round
Bridges keep burning down
Nobody can hear you now
No matter how loud you shout
[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]
Sitting in total silence
Totally lost, no guidance
'Dey don't call no more, nobody can find ya'
Nobody can find the time like they lost their watch
They find it hard to think you went soft
They find an architect that I've promised that I make sure
He puts the building blocks in place
Start rebuilding, we've been broken since children
They keep telling me that we're only human
I don't do no silly excuses
Nobody wins, we're losing
So violent and abusive
It's all battle, scars and bruises
'Cause what really-

[Hook 2: Tom Grennan]
The sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
That angel's eyes, they bleed
This life, I chose
My open wounds they show that
Memory lane is like a winding road

[Hook 1: Bugzy Malone]
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

I just want you to know that I love you
It's a cruel world outside but I need you to know that I got you
Such a forgetful place and I don't want them to forget you
Hard times have arrived and I wanna make sure that we get through

[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]
I look into your eyes sometimes
All I can see is emptiness, no resemblance, no more fire
Or anything similar
When did the winter get to us
I'll go blind, looking at a light so bright?
But if I can find my way
Then I'll come back for you and I'll make it right
I wanna say something but I don't know how
I gotta keep it moving, I can't turn 'round
How did David make Goliath fall down?
What's the king if the king has lost its crown?

[Pre-Hook: Tom Grennan]
But today is our day
We ain't running away
But the night was so long that
Today is the day that we break off our chains?

[Hook 2: Tom Grennan]
When the sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
That angel's eyes, they bleed, this life I chose
My open wounds they show
That memory lane is like a winding road
Like a winding road
[Outro: Tom Grennan]
Memory lane is like a winding road (Oh-h)
Like a winding road
Memory lane is like a winding road (Oh-h)
Like a winding road10Embed
