No one like you Lyrics [lyrics by "Nobody like you"]

[Intro: threateazzy]
Everyone knows that I am behind you (I'm behind you)
I want to get your attention (I want, I want to get your attention)
You are much more than I asked (OH-OH, UOH)
You are one in a million

[Chorus: threateazzy]
Is that there is no one like you, nobody, nobody
Is that there is no
No one like you, nobody, nobody
Nowhere
No one like you, nobody, nobody
No, no, baby
No one like you, nobody, nobody
It has that level
[Post-Coro: Menazzy]
It has that level, it has that level (it has that level)
It has that level, it has that level (it has that level)
It has that level, it has that level (it has that level)
It has that level, it has that level (it has that level)

[Verse 1: g-eazy]
You Know, Yeah
And you look butter up close
A Hundred White Roses' Cuz I Do The Upmost
Let's Pop Champagne, Got As For One Toast
They can try, they don't even eat close
Yeah, See How Crazy We Are
She Got Me On Flights from The Bay To Dr
If you ever need me, i'll never be far
She Dies When I'M Gone, Like She Needs CPR
Yeah, no, no, There's Nobody
Only you and i know what i do to your body (hey)
It's just me and you, Molly eats Meet us at the party (ah)
Couldn't Make It To The Room SO We Did It In The Lobby (You Know; Yup, Yeep, Yep; You Know)

[Choir: threateazzy & g-eazy, threateazzy]
No one like you, nobody, nobody
Is that there is no
No one like you, nobody, nobody
Nowhere
No one like you, nobody, nobody
No, no, baby
No one like you, nobody, nobody
It has that level

[Chorus: threateazzy]
