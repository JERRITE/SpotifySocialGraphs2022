OT BOPPIN Lyrics[Intro: Bandokay & Double Lz]
(Ayy, Tefo made this one) add a K to the O, get blam
(TKBeats made this)
Free Slim Jim, Free Boogie Bando
Yo

[Verse 1: Bandokay & Double LZ]
Won't stop shootin' 'til the whole ting's empty (Baow)
Better take this L like NP or ZT, swingin' my blade, don't tempt me (Don't do it)
Farm blocks, late night, no entry
Century, porkies all wan' arrest me (Why's that?)
Yo, man get soaked like jezzies (Ching)
5AM, gettin' nicked for a murder, no further, he got it drowned, no wellies
Donny got drowned, no wellies, no wellington so we can't see clear (Blurry)
Foot on the clutch, into gear
Wind down the window, they all disappear (Where you goin'?)
The neighbours like, "What happened here?"
Donny got shaved, but he still got hair
Big drip, little drip, got teared
Got me with Lerky, we had big man scared (Ayy, dash)
[Verse 2: Double Lz & Bandokay]
Shotgun, man slap, man boot it (Boot it)
Ching man down, now his Canada's ruined (Haha)
Don't think we can sleep on a vio' (Ayy), we came right back and then done two bootings (Ayy, ayy)
Chill in the same spot, what are you doin'? (What you doin'?)
They just don't learn like stupid students (Ha)
Spot any opps, don't think, just do it (Baow, baow, baow)
Hundred percent, broski's gonna shoot it (Boom)
Hop out the ride, he's dashin', catch him, do man up and then vanish
Free Boogie B, well-known savage (Free broski)
Pull up on them and of course they panic (Pull up)
Next day, me and Abz went on a lurk (Ayy)
Didn't see nuttin', just one little strangers
This beef is fryin'
Don't get caught lackin' (Yo)
Out real late, oh, damn, he's gassin'

[Chorus: Bandokay & Double Lz]
I see broski watch him, cotch him, mob him, hopped out the ride and chopped him
The Get Back's dropped him, everyone's flossin', gassed up, OT boppin'
Machine gun shoppin', this shotgun lockin', two hands, baow and pop him
My aunty still ask if I'm fine
A lot's on my mind, but the money ain't stoppin' (Lz, Lz, Lz)
Due to get long when corn starts flyin'
Buck into A, don't expect kindness
Ridin', ridin', I find it excitin'
Knife it, knife it, somebody's dyin' (Ha)
Pipe it, pipe it, babes stop pipin' (Pipe it)
Cuzzy come down, if I ride, he's ridin' (Cuzzy)
Bad B come to the Nizz for a pipin' (Bando)
Jeet it, leave it and little bro swipe it

I'm with L, that's my big pal, he's on violence, he don't make no sound (At all)
Spin the whip, give a fuck 'bout the crowd
If you chill the opps, you ain't makin' me proud (Grrt, baow)
Bro, what's wrong with this child?
He got his times two, still runs his mouth
Cuzzy comes to the ends
If broski's ridin' then I'm ridin', no doubt
I got hella leng tings from South
Just bruck their back and open mouths
Me, Bando, I don't chase no clout
I just hit the oppy, smoke it and I'm out
My broski got nicked like 'how?'
Just wish him the best when they take him to trial
My broski got nicked like 'how?'
Just wish him the best when they take him to trial

[Chorus: Bandokay & Double Lz]
I see broski watch him, cotch him, mob him
Hopped out the ride and chopped him
The Get Back's dropped him, everyone's flossin'
Gassed up, OT boppin'
Machine gun shoppin'
Shotgun lockin'
Two hands, bow and pop him
My aunty still ask if I'm fine
I lost my mind but the money ain't stoppin'
Due to get long when corn starts flyin'
Buck into A, don't expect kindness
Ridin', ridin', I find it excitin'
Knife it, knife it, somebody's dyin'
Pipe it, pipe it, babes stop pipin'
Cuzzy come down, if I ride, he's ridin'
Bad B come to the Nizz for a pipin'
Jeet it, leave it and little bro swipe it
[Verse 4: Double Lz]
Ridin', tappin', this shit's fantastic
Ay broski, pass me the dot-dot
Watch man hopscotch, trip, get cabbaged
OFB, we got shottys and daggers
Hammers, pull up on opps and they're dashin'
Head to blocka, just done a mad ting
Sad ting, done up a yute, no manners
Bill two spliffs and forget what happened
Angle of arms, I swing it
Dip it, rip it, twist it, kill it
Everyone's bad 'til bro starts chingin'
Gunshot hole leave you in you existence
We caught one, he left his missus
Pull up on my block, it's scripts we're flippin'
Three doors pop, shotgun get lifted
If we caught him, you would've seen him on pictures

[Chorus: Bandokay & Double Lz]
Yo, I seen broski watch him, cotch him, mob him
Hopped out the ride and chopped him
The Get Back's dropped him, everyone's flossin'
Gassed up, OT boppin'
Machine gun shoppin'
Shotgun lockin'
Two hands, bow and pop him
My aunty still ask if I'm fine
I lost my mind but the money ain't stoppin'
Due to get long when corn starts flyin'
Buck into A, don't expect kindness
Ridin', ridin', I find it excitin'
Knife it, knife it, somebody's dyin'
Pipe it, pipe it, babes stop pipin'
Cuzzy come down, if I ride, he's ridin'
Bad B come to the Nizz for a pipin'
Jeet it, leave it and little bro swipe it1Embed
