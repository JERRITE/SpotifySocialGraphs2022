In the boulevard (run, run) Lyricsel another day I saw you pass
When you ran through the boulevard
Then I stopped
And to climb my car I invited you
You turned your face
You removed your glasses
Your brown eyes looked
And after an hour I managed to go up
My radio at the time, I set it
I looked for the tone
The best melodies
Everything came without control
I looked at the rearview mirror
Avenida was all mine
And run, run, run through the boulevard
Run, run, run without looking back
Run, run, I will catch you
Run, run, I can no longer
THOSE YOUR EYES LOOKED
And I fell in love
And that's what I asked you
If my boyfriend wanted to be
And you told me that ...
The other day I saw you pass
When you ran through the boulevard
Then I stopped
And to climb my car I invited you
You turned your face
You removed your glasses
Your brown eyes looked
And after an hour I excited you
And the nerve in a moment stutter
Look for the red carmin
The most colorful dust
Everything came without control
You wanted an aventone
My name asked me
And run, run, run through the boulevard
Run, run, run without looking back
Run, run, I will catch you
Run, run, I can no longer
THOSE YOUR EYES LOOKED
And I fell in love
And that's what I asked you
If my boyfriend wanted to be
And you told me that ...
The other day I saw you pass
Run, run, run without looking back
You were running through the boulevard
Run, run, I will catch you
Run, run, I can no longer
Run, run, run through the boulevard
Run, run, run without looking back
Run, run, I'm going to catch you might also likembed
