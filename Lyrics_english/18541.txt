Love is a memory (LOVE Is a Memory) [Acoustic Version] Lyrics Love
I think it's a passing memory
If you look at you, your heart trembles
I think love is a memory
I think it's a memory of leaving
It remains even if you push it
Not many times
I ran the end with you
We in the melodramic movie
Even if it wasn't until the main character
I think it was attractive
Occasionally hidden
If you look at the picture in the drawer, you know
Actually
I'm sleeping to see you
If you meet you
I can see it
Even if it's all past,
Keep thinking
To make sure you feel firmly
The relationship between us alone
It's already forgotten
My heart doesn't matter now
Whoever says
It's been a long time since your number
I was also worried about blocking
But I don't know why
I can't forget it sometimes
I don't think it's regret
Even if I remember it once or twice
I don't think it's a relationship
Even if I was a lover of once
The secret place in my heart
Ask you in all parts
Whenever, wherever
I hope to eat well and live well
I think love is a memory
I think it's a passing memory
If you look at you, your heart trembles
I think love is a memory
I think it's a memory of leaving
It remains even if you push it
It was good to see every day
The relationship between you
It's already forgotten
Whoever says
Unusable words
Promises that cannot be kept
These useless words
You don't need it, you didn't hear it
I was forgotten little by little
As the season changes and time passes
I got used to it
As the winter passes and spring comes
I just lived
Until everything gets fine
Eventually it became a memory of a cup
The relationship between us alone
It's already forgotten
My heart doesn't matter now
Whoever says
It's been a long time since your number
I was also worried about blocking
But I don't know why
I can't forget it sometimes
I don't move to action
Asking my regards in my heart
The ear is open again
Listen to your regards in people
On my bed flying in the wind
Walking of your scent
I'm getting more and more familiar
Now I'm really going to say goodbye
I think love is a memory
I think it's a passing memory
If you look at you, your heart trembles
I think love is a memory
I think it's a memory of leaving
It remains even if you push it
BABY I LOVED YOUR WAY
Baby What can I say
Remember our days
BABY I LOVED YOUR WAY
Baby What can I say
I'm sorry for not doing well you might Also Likeembed
