Netflixxx Lyrics ["Netflixxx" letter]]

[Enter: Bad Bunny]
Today I am only for you
Vamo 'smoking watching netflix

[Verse 1: Brytiago]
I'm always pending my business
I think you like that about me
A high floor, you know me
You are the only one I bring here
[Chorus: Brytiago]
If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'smoking watching netflix

If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'a chinggar watching netflix

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Imagine that we have been
Imagine that I am your boyfriend when I kiss you
Even if we just see ourselves to fuck sometimes
I am not Romeo or you are Julieta
You only call me for me to put it in
Do not fall in love, that's the goal
Baby, you are hard, I invite her for house and with me heals
We set more Phillies than in a culture concert
He takes off my clothes and jumps on the bug like kangura
He says I'm the only one to get it and swears it
I don't want to be your official jevo
I am satisfied to give you once a month
But if you want I can try
I can be faithful, if you believe it

If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'smoking watching netflix

If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'smoking watching netflix

[Verse 3: Brytiago]
The baby is TV model
Hey only trap and a bit of R&B
Janguea so much with the friend
That people think they are even bi
I almost didn't see it
I stopped and I was surprised
I saw your nipples screen with hoops
Became exotic when I turned on
It is one of those who believe it is healthy
And when it goes for mine, what it does is see porn and smoking marijuana
Janguea Nomas Pa 'Los Ghett'
Smoking 'and baby' pa 'calm the thirst
He tells the boyfriend that he is seeing net '
And he loves to see the series with the command on the wall
Although we are nothing, but in the week
I invite you to see movies and smoking marijuana
Turn off the TV, he likes dark because he doesn't look
I can be faithful if we only see Netflix
[Chorus: Bad Bunny, Brytiago]
If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'smoking watching netflix

If you believe it, I also believe it
Today I am only for you
It's more baby, I'm your jevo tonight
Vamo 'a chinggar watching netflix
