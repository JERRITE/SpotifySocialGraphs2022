Garden Party Lyrics[Intro: Masego]
Ayy, check it out
We havin' a party in the garden tonight
Ladies get in free
Well, as long as you don't stop dancing with the guy
If you like look behind and you're like, oh, this, this nigga ugly
Yeah, I get it (Yes, yes, yes, he is)
But that's my homie though, that's my mans
So like, dance with him
'Cause he was first chair in high school
So respect him (Yeah, look)
[Verse 1: Masego]
You know the vibes, you know my tribe
Instruments, you know it's live
When I turn up, I don't enter the place
Without 'em (Saxophone, ching)
When I show up, the place gets real colossal  (Talk about it)
It's like la-di-da-di, I like to party (Uh)
Like to kick back (Yeah) with a shawty
But this the night of the battle of the bands
Slash crump battle slash twerk dance
Slash rap battle slash call all my dogs
Heh, you better get on this song

[Chorus: Masego]
'Cause it look like Stomp The Yard in the garden
Battle of the bands, we starting
Here all night, they won't leave
We all vibe and we sing, like

[Verse 2: JID]
Look, uh
Almond-soft skin, her ass fat
Awkward walk wobbling, wopty-wop
Draggin' a wagon, I park, sparked up the doobie in my pocket
How my dogs walking theyself? Barking and catchin' coffins
Party, party, pour me a shot, if I shoot the sheriff
Would you call me in the morning? Rest in fruit of my loins?
You love me? Lady, you lying, this little light of mine
I let it shine but like a dynamite
I been high as heaven, drunk as hell but don't fly right
Seeing tie-dye colors and side-eye cover with shades from the sideline
Say goodbye (Bye), in my shaky life I try to stabilize
Crazy times, I gotta pray to God, but He don't say nothing
You might also like[Chorus: Masego]
I think it look like Stomp The Yard in the garden
Battle of the bands, we starting up
Here all night, they won't leave
We all vibe and we sing, like

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Pass the Casamigo Reposado, taking shots in the garden
It's starting to get hotter without heating lamp
See, now we be amped up when it's time to plant our seeds
Off in the bushes, got 'em gushin' like a hydroponic system
And I would love to listen to you breathe in my ear
As we make sweet love under the trees
My dearly beloved, clearly nobody can come between
This man and his woman, fit just like a hand inside a glove
When I'm stuffing all this lovin' in your oven
Hot tub Tony, I'm sucker-free and still bubblin'
They left it up to me so I keep this motherfucker bumpin'
A lil' sump’n sump’n

[Chorus: Masego]
'Cause it look like Stomp The Yard in the garden
Battle of the bands, we starting
Here all night, they won't leave
We all vibe and we sing, like
[Outro: Masego]
Girl, you're hot like Sunday
I get like you one day
Finna take you high, yeah
Girl, your one desire3Embed
