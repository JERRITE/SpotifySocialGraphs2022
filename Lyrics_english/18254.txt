Ain’T Loyal Lyrics [The lyrics "Ain’t Loyal" Feat. Telly Grave]

[Verse 1: Noa]
Lime sinks in soda
Trying to hold on to the edge
So tired of mutual secrets
Is this our cherished paradise?
Every day only snow and rain
There is only a lie between us
White lie, and
Slowly hand
You will spend your hair so gently
"You are the only one"
But for me you are far from the only
The head is around
In this place so crowded and noisy
I want to go home, fuck it all
[Bridge: Noa]
You are like this for everyone, it's fashionable
They are trying to pick you up after midnight
You are lying to them, saying that you are not free
I know you are not at home
Maybe the truth is not needed, then everything is so
You sob in my SoundCloud in the evenings
This music does not like your friends, like me

[Chorus: Noa]
Where are you, with whom you are not my business, not my business
Those secrets are not my business, not my business
To be honest, a lot of promises are just words
You let me down again
You let me down again

[Verse 2: Telly Grave & Noa]
I hold Hanny in my hand, send a fuck Xanny
My angel cries gray, but it bleeds white
Every day, like Monday, my wings under the sight
Telly G does not believe them all, I will throw snakes on the chain
This city smells gray, I will throw hay into it
Bitching will sit down batteries, I burst into her with Durazhel
New gelding, her loyalty, go fuck, I don't believe
Rain, Make it rain, do it for the sake of money
She whispers to me "love"
Although he knows, I will not get caught
On the carnival pussy of these bitches
Sorry, Boo, but I Gotta Move
A lot of things, I'm going forward
There is only a lie between us
Excuses, in the back - a knife
Rain on my street again

Not my business
Not my business (not my business)
Not my business
Not my business (not my business)
Not my business
Not my business (not my business)
Not my business (not my business)

[Chorus: Noa]
Where are you, with whom you are not my business, not my business
Those secrets are not my business, not my business
To be honest, a lot of promises are just words
You are again downward
