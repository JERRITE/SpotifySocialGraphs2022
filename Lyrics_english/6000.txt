P.S. Missing You Lyrics[Intro]
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

[Verse 1]
See myself in the broken glass
Shattered pieces fallin' down again, down again
I'm breakin' down again, down again, yeah
I've seen too much, I know myself
And I've been too fucked up to ask for help
But do you even care?
Is there anybody out there?
It's comin' 'round, comin' 'round, comin' 'round again
[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so alone
Screaming at nothing
I feel so alone
Searching for something
Now I'm breaking down and you're not around
I get lost in the sound
And I feel so alone
And you can't save me

[Verse 2]
I hate myself for the things I've done
So hopeless, feeling so down again, down again
It's breaking me down again, down again
Take what's left, take me away
'Cause I've been too fucked up to try to change
But do you even care?
(Is there anybody in there?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so alone
Screaming at nothing
I feel so alone
Searching for something
Now I'm breaking down and you're not around
I get lost in the sound
And I feel so alone
And you can't save me
You might also like[Bridge]
Don't look me right in the eye
Don't tell me this is goodbye
'Cause I'm missing you, I'm missing you
Don't look me right in the eye
Don't tell me that this is goodbye
'Cause I'm missing you, I'm missing you

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so alone
Screaming at nothing
I feel so alone (Alone)
Searching for something
Now I'm breaking down and you're not around
I get lost in the sound
And I feel so alone (So alone)
And you can't save me
Yeah

[Outro]
(Don't look me right in the eye
Don't tell me this is goodbye
'Cause I'm missing you, I'm missing you)Embed
