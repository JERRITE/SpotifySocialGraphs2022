I ask you love lyricsme I felt dead in life when I got to you
As lost as the ship without rudder
From work to the slave house of the clock
With just time or love

Love, a lightning in the dark
Love, Little Electricity
Love, earthquake shaking
The night becomes day by you

Heart, I ask you love
I need to feel my body vibrate
Heart, heart you have again
In your arms I shudder again
You have to grab the blood for my veins

Heart, I need love
Take me to the stars, take me

I expected the Sun of April
I hoped you would come today for me

Love, a lightning in the dark
Love, Little Electricity
Love, earthquake shaking
The night becomes day by you

Heart, I ask you love
I need to feel my body vibrate

Heart, heart you have again
In your arms I shudder again
You have to grab the blood for my veins

Heart, I ask you love
I need to feel my body vibrate

Heart, heart you have again
In your arms I shudder again
