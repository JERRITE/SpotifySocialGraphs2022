Be in love Lyrics [lyrics of "Being in love"]

[Intro: little Juan & Mr. Dec]
Yeh-eh (uh!)
Yeh-eh (uh!)
Yeh-eh-eh-eh (knows')
Poula!

[Saying: Mr. Dec]
25 hours a day, 8 days a week
Wake up in the morning
And look for you under my pillow
And it does not reach my time
To express what I feel
The wind takes it
[Pre-Caro: Mr. Dec]
Because when love comes that way
One does not even realize
The heart bursts
And it's partying, you know

[Chorus: Mr. Dec]
Being in love is
Dance together in the rain
Being in love is
Hit the moon bites
Be in love e-es
Maybe what I feel

[Verse 1: small Juan]
If you don't give me a beak
I cry like Kiko
I'm big not boy
If you don't understand me, I facilitate
I'm not poor, I'm rich
Because of your kisses flavor to Tampico
Hey!, Nana-Nana-Nana
Lero-Lero-Lero (Shi-Shin)
If you give me a kiss I love you
Nana-Nana-Nana
Lero-Lero-Lero (haha)
Yes No I hope

You are my queen (just for me)
You are a goddess (only for me)
You are my princess (only for me)
Raspberry flavor

[Chorus: Mr. Dec]
Being in love is
Dance together in the rain
Being in love is
Hit the moon bites
Be in love e-es
Maybe what I feel

[Verse 2: small Juan]
It is not worth a kiss just
When I want kisses for dozen
If you don't give me one, I stay as a soul in grief
You are my baby, my baby, my baby
Juntitos both, A-Lala-Lala-Lon
Making love, a-lala-lala-lon
It's what I want, A-Lala-Lala-Lon
I swear by God (JA)

[Bridge: Mr. Dec & small Juan]
You are my queen (just for me)
You are a goddess (only for me)
You are my princess (only for me)
Raspberry flavor

[Saying: Mr. Dec]
(25 hours a day, 8 days a week
Wake up in the morning
And look for you under my pillow)
And it does not reach my time
To express what I feel
The wind takes it

[Pre-Caro: Mr. Dec]
Because when love comes that way
One does not even realize
The heart bursts
And it's partying, you know

[Outro: Mr. Dec & small Juan]
Being in love is (blow by blow, blow), ouh-no
Being in love is (more lunatic, more lunatic), baby
Hey!, Little Juan and Mr. Dec, little Juan and Mr. Dec
Alexander DJ, D-D-DJ (Poula!)
