Worst Thing Lyrics[Chorus: Inayah]
I knew he wasn't the one, but it was the history
That kept me from running, I know
We be so caught up and comfortable that
(Ayy, Heavy turn the beat up, though)
We forget to be who we were before then
Man, it's funny how love works
Especially when you thought that love would work
You know somebody's gonna get hurt
(MK, get that shit up, then)
And you just pray that it ain't you first
[Verse 1: Lakeyah]
Look
I said I always find out, and I'm never surprised
Look at the bitches you be gassin', I was never yo' type
I could, hurt you bad, and I could show you how it feel, nigga
I can really go and put this pussy on a real nigga
I wanna thank you for revealing your colors
Now I can take my time to heal, and I can finally recover
Change myself, all for the sake of this relationship
You envious and insecure, you deserve a basic bitch
History ain't shit when the love ain't in it
That's the reason why I'm always screaming, "Fuck these niggas"
Man, you the reason, if I leave, I won't trust these niggas
Honestly speaking, all honesty, I'm done with these niggas
Ain't gotta tell 'em what you did, gon' and talk yo' shit
Nigga, I'm good regardless, with or without that dick
I gave too much, I overplayed my part too fast
Regardless of my qualities, none of this love shit last
And that's on God

[Chorus: Inayah]
I knew he wasn't the one, but it was the history
That kept me from running, I know
We be so caught up and comfortable that
We forget to be who we were before then
Man, it's funny how love works
Especially when you thought that love would work
You know somebody's gonna get hurt
And you just pray that it ain't you first

Ayy
They say this love shit dangerous, somebody get hurt
Instead of being broken-hearted, I should've fucked off first
But I'm solid as a bitch, so I'ma do you one worse
Like fuck a love song, 'cause I'ma put my heart in this verse
I'm a hundred times better than them bitches that you entertain
Good pussy and my head on straight, I deserve a wedding ring
I can't take you back, 'cause this shit won't never be the same
Spoiled you with loyalty, you never bought me shit but pain
Wondering why it's fuck you? I got a hundred reasons
For example, you said you loved me, and you didn't mean it
But I can only blame myself, I was naive believin'
That a nigga could ever change after I caught him cheatin'
I put you on to all that new, I showed you shit you never seen
I gave you everything you wanted, gave you everything you need
I thought I created somethin' bitches couldn't come between
You gon' meet a hundred scrubs before you meet another me
And that's on God

[Chorus: Inayah]
I knew he wasn't the one, but it was the history
That kept me from running, I know
We be so caught up and comfortable that
We forget to be who we were before then
Man, it's funny how love works
Especially when you thought that love would work
You know somebody's gonna get hurt
And you just pray that it ain't youâ€”Embed
