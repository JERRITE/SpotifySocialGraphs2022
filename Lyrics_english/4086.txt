[Intro: Darío Gómez, Luis Alberto Posada, Carín León & Pipe Bueno]
That brought me guaro
Beer and liquor
And let them come old
Pa 'pass by bastard
And who said the "H" is mute, old?
Compa Pipe
Ay ay ay
[Verse 1: Carín León & Jhon Alex Castaño]
My wife has left me
By drunk and bandit
Pa 'not to walk
In the Peda I live it
I will get drunk
With all my parriers
And as the saying goes
Pal 'center and pa' inside

[Pre-car: Carín León & El Charrito Negro]
Because tonight I swear I will forget you
So that I cry, the net you do not bring with what
You don't want to go back and there is a row that dies
For this baby

[Chorus: good pipe & all]
What brought me guaro
Beer and liquor
And what are old come
Pa 'pass by bastard
To bring me tequila
Beer and liquor
That the mariachi sounds
Until sunrise

[Verse 2: Yeison Jiménez, Jessi Uribe, Jhonny Rivera]
I am dawned
With two next to me
The two tell me daddy, like they want something
But I could not
I'm sore (je)
And a little confused
The one I want me to love me, does not love me as I want
But he loves me screwed

[Pre-Caro: Jessi Uribe & Yeison Jiménez]
Because tonight I swear I will forget you
I already got tired and I swear I will erase you
You don't want to go back and there is a row that dies
For this baby

[Coro: Darío Gómez, Luis Alberto Posada, El Charrito Negro & Pipe Bueno]
That brought me guaro
Beer and liquor
And let them come old
Pa 'pass by bastard
To bring me tequila
Beer and liquor
That the mariachi sounds
Until sunrise
[Interlude 2: Good pipe]
My mariachi
Take me the part that I like the most
Echele!

[Pre-Caro: Juan Pablo Navarrete & Alzate]
Because tonight I swear I will forget you
I already got tired and I swear I will erase you
You don't want to go back and there is a row that dies
For this baby (haha)

[Choir: Alzate, Pipe Bueno & All]
That brought me guaro
Beer and liquor
And let them come old
Pa 'pass by bastard
To bring me tequila
Beer and liquor
That the mariachi sounds
Until the solembed comes out
