â€‹Boyfriend, Girlfriend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever you wanna call it
There was a boy and a girl, and their two worlds collided
Couple kids in the summer heat at seventeen
Ended up falling in love accidentally

[Chorus]
Took me all night
You caught me by surprise
Baby blue-eyed
Napoleon Dynamite
Kiss me goodnight
So, I won't forget
The very first time
That your lips met mine
[Verse 2]
Your sisters didn't like me
But they were the first ones to say, we should date
I remember it like it was yesterday
Pretty and prettier you get in every way, everyday

[Chorus]
Took me all night
You caught me by surprise
Baby blue-eyed
Napoleon Dynamite
Kiss me goodnight
So, I won't forget
The very first time
That your lips met mine

[Outro]
You're everything to me
You're everything to meYou might also likeEmbed
