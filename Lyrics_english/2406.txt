Youâ€™re My Only Shorty Lyrics[Verse 1: Demi Lovato & Iyaz]
Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
C'mon, ring, ring, ring (Yeah, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid  (Yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha say, boy?
[Chorus: Iyaz & Demi Lovato]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (Oh)
Girl, it's only you, (Whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Every day and night you've got an open invitation, (Whoa)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy, (Woo)
You're in demand, but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you "Bye, bye"
I'ma put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy? (Woo)

[Chorus: Iyaz & Demi Lovato]
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (Oh)
Girl, it's only you, (Whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

Please, baby, please
Give me all your attention (Say it)
Don't let my heart go seeking no other direction
I gotta be the only one for your affection (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

[Chorus: Iyaz & Demi Lovato]
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Baby, come clean)
I'm telling you the truth, (Oh)
Girl, it's only you, (Whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (Whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty (Am I your only shorty?)

[Outro: Demi Lovato & Iyaz]
Am I your only?
Am I your only? (Yeah)
Tell me, am I your only shorty? (Yes, you are)
Why won't you say that? (Yes, you are)
Am I your only shorty?5Embed
