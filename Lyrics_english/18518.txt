TranslationsEspa√±olLonely Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
You, treat me just like a cigarette
Light me up just to get a hit
Get your fix, and now I'm just some other stupid chick

[Pre-Chorus]
Fell in love with a loading gun
Took a shot and you got me drunk
It was fun but now the party's over
Sugar coated candy sounds sweet
But now your sour's stuck in my teeth
[Verse 2]
I'm crying over you
Oh what to do
My tears are black
My heart is blue
What you did it just ain't cool
Oh why
Why did you have to lie?
You broke your promise
I am not your one and only
Now I'm just another lonely girl
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Now I'm just another lonely girl

[Chorus]
I was just a frame for your masterpiece
Push me over and underneath
Black satin sheets
The dirty laundry you hung out to dry
I swallow a pill to erase the pain
Wash it down with some cheap champagne
My lipstick stain's the only thing remaining
Cinderella story it seems
But mine is ending unhappily
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm crying over you
Oh what to do
My tears are black
My heart is blue
What you did it just ain't cool
Oh why
Why did you have to lie?
You broke your promise
I am not your one and only
Now I'm just another lonely girl

[Verse 3]
I wonder where the lonely lovers go
To fix their lonely souls and get some piece of mind
Maybe the lonely world's a world apart
Might be a work of art
Might be a broken heart
There it dies

[Verse 4]
I'm crying over you
Oh what to do
My tears are black
My heart is blue
What you did it just ain't cool
Oh why
Why did you have to lie?
You broke your promise
I am not your one and only
Now I'm just another lonely girl
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Now I'm just another lonely girl
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Now I'm just another lonely girlEmbed
