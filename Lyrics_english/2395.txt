Uh, pa pa

[Verse 1: Giusy Ferreri]
I just wanted to unplug, go elsewhere
It doesn't matter where, when, it doesn't matter how
I just wanted to pull me up
In order not to think about you and then let me fall down down
So let's go to the sea, in the middle of a storm
When the rain falls, you fall

[Refrain: Giusy Ferreri]
I was looking for a calm sea and I found you
With the wind so strong, don't tell me goodnight
Only for tonight
Love and Capoeira
Cachaça and full moon
Like in a favela
Like in a favela

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
Baby Gyal You Don't Have To Lie
I Can See it in Your Eyes
You've Been Down Enough for Too Long
Think it's time to move on, yeah
I know how roll with a weed-a weed-a
Drop Top in The Summer, or the Winter-Winter
Nuff of dem try hype, but then can't like closer
When Sean King Pull up Gyal, You Now It's Ova
Flex, time to have sex
Push up your back gyal you know this is it
Now Flex, Time to have sex
Real Good Loving So You Cannot Resist, no no
(Let's Go)

I was looking for a calm sea and I found you
With the wind so strong, don't tell me goodnight
Only for tonight
Love and Capoeira
Cachaça and full moon
Like in a favela
Like in a favela

[Bridge: Giusy Ferreri]
Nobody sleeps
There is the sun even at night
I said it a thousand times
That everything can happen
You arrive, who in return ask me
A special night

[Refrain: Giusy Ferreri]
I was looking for a calm sea and I found you
With the wind so strong, don't tell me goodnight
Only for tonight
Love and Capoeira
Cachaça and full moon
Like in a favela, eh eh, eh eh, eh eh
Like in a favela, eh eh, eh eh, eh eh
Love and Capoeira1embed
