Bitter lyrics [lyrics to "Bitter"]

[Intro]
Ah, this life - my life
Deux deux neuf, ma villance
385i
Jimmy Torrio

[Part]
This life tastes so bitter, my boys are behind bars
V-men are trembling, are afraid of the thunderstorm
Yallah, piss off, you pisser (yallah), because here you are not sure
The only thing that is certain, the warrant from the judge
German rappers are only Stricher, Pusher or stoner
They talk about a good course, but there are no tickers
Lak, you monkey on killers with weapons in your pictures
Get me all your Kahbas and I'll fuck her with my finger
Turn hundred thousand things, it gets worse every day
I drive without rags and do not note any signs
Children in my Hood box, whether Ali or Sindbad
Your Abla will be fucked, she gets my cari here in the swimming pool
Massari here with Zitla, wants to drive Ferrari or ship
My Money on My Mind, Ah-AH, Armani or G-Star
Mas5ara, are you disabled? There are no five here
Maybe with the Yormas Arabs if you are lucky
Are you sosa or zincer? You catch a turn signal (yes)
One looking for a few candies in front of the finca
Only a blender like Batista runs away when he has shit
Talking about hookers fuck, but is a wanker
Lak, I upload and wander ', I'm not fully comprehensive insured
Your hookers, like you, have hundreds of faces
Give yourself pushups sit-ups, but you are never a fucker
I miss a passport like the Stuttgart Kickers
Go swing on the playground and Laber 'not from feature
Unless you have a visa, I want green, yellow and purple
Latina Adriana Lima, fucking on Ibiza
Kiram to Dahanet Kesafate Gina Lisa
AMG or Alpina, Submariner, La Martina
All of this is the reason why the Kanak has a goal
Like Snipers in Palestine, the Ba-Baba ballert again blatant songs
Until it finally says: "Ekho, Viva la vida!"
Bring the OT ticker Ginger
I make contact lenses from your glasses like opticians binder
Gauner and swindler who winked when poker
Start at midnight robbery with the sprinter
Deux deux neuf is boss like (pshht)
Smoke in the underground car park hash, oil, twizzla
There is nothing that prevents us
We make your children disabled with our drugs
There is nothing that prevents us
We make your children disabled with our stanzas (yes, yes, yes, yes)
[Outro]
This life tastes so bitter
When does the time come, then I'm free
Deux deux neuf ma ville ville
385i
Yeah, habibiyou might
