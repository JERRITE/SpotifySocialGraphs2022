TranslationEnglish Português हिन्दी DJ Khaled - God Did Ft. Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend & Fridayy? (Spanish translation) Lyrics ["DJ Khaled

[Enter: DJ Khaled]
My heart breaks
They do not believe in us
We The Best Music
They played themselves
While you hate and you're jealous
You could be here hugging that love
More love, more blessings, more life
God did it!
Or you want or see us winning
DJ Khaled
[Pre-stribe: Fridayy & Rick Ross]
They loved us Bajo, OH-OH-OH
But look at us now, oh-oh
They told us (it's time to say a prayer, m-m-m-m—)
They did not think we would achieve it, OH-OH-OH (here we crouch our heads)
They did not believe in us, OH-OH (HUH)

[Chorus: Fridayy & Rick Ross]
But I know that God did it, God did it (oh, yes, he did)
God did (oh-oh, khaled)
Oh yes, God did (oh-oh, khaled)
Oh God did (God is great)
But I know that God did it, God did it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
In Picada, they just pray to crash me (Huh)
Those guys don't want to see you for the last time
Three million dollars will rise in your taxes
A tub full of money, I still can't relax
The tires turn, sir, forgive me, I am a sinner
Conquest, divide black
Wrong side of the petition, only divine winning
Better listen when I tell you how I wear time
Please forgive me, God did
So leave me in the dark, swimming with sharks
Drug addict, great calm, I'm still the biggest boss
I have a kilo on a plate, send them in a freight
Or I can go and buy a bank, I know that my money is safe (Maybach Music)

But look at us now, oh-oh
They told us
They didn't think we would achieve it, OH-OH-OH

[Chorus: fridayy & lil wayne]
But I know that God did it, God did it (oh, yes, he did)
Oh God did (oh-oh)
Oh yes, God did (oh-oh)
Oh God did (mule, uh)
But I know that God did it, God did it

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The sky is the limit, every day I reach it
They were tired of winning, now they sleep dead
Don't you want to see me with the ring? You better play with the P
Black, God did his thing when he made me
With the chances against me, I could decipher Da Vinci
I know that only God can judge us, I say it for Brittney
Blood smell like sharks, they begin to act suspicious
Well, I'll have to act like an idiot and they will have to kiss me
Please don't hate me just by hating me
Before they get overvalued, they underestimated me
Funeral and wake up, enter me and excve me
But I am so growing, everyone replicates me, black, they face the facts
Rista, facial tattoos, I am the vertex
I did the culture, what happens, twin? I never relax
I took the world and when I did, I practiced safe sex
I pray more and say less, God did the rest
[Pre-stribe: Fridayy & Jay-Z]
They loved us Bajo, OH-OH-OH
But look at us now, oh-oh
They told us
They did not think we would achieve it, OH-OH-OH (I break my heart)
They did not believe in us, OH-OH

[Chorus: fridayy & jay-z]
But I know that God did it, God did it (where are we friend?)
God did (oh, yes, he did, where are we friend?)
Oh God did (oh-oh)
Oh yes, God did (oh-oh)
Oh, God did it
But I know that God did it, God did it

[Verse 3: jay-z]
Hov did it
Please, sir, forgive me for what the stove did
No one touched the billion until Hov did it
How many billionaires can come to HPV's house? HUH
I count three, I, Ye and Rih
Bron is a Roc boy, so four, technically (Woo)
I left the drug game with my clean history, Huh
I converted cocaine into champagne, huh
I cleaned the godmother with the same soap, huh
Loro and I talked about how we use drug jargon, HUH
Now the grass is in stores, can you believe this tie?
I put my robbery in Forbes, can you believe this guy?
Then we said, "at the fuck", and we took the public drug
Outside the mud, they have to face you now, you can't invent this shit
Júzga as you judge it, say that we are going to be corporate
Nah, we just cornered the boys with the corner office
I am at the lies table, what are the divisions?
Not that table of lies, boy, we live this
Brezy what is the business
We push Fenty as Fentanyl, everything is legitimate (Woo)
E was ten down for this
We had just recovered their ten and then we returned as, "where are the interests?"
EM turns on the O3
We let the zazas, og for the OG
Some new blacks in your pocket, speaking exotic
You have barely been in the Bahamas— (haha) that's another topic
Monogram in my red carpet pocket
You see the face I made that night, shit is so shocking
The chances were not good, we would even be alive
I have to be crazy with all these blacks, we were surprised
Shit is too much as we grew (we grew up)
Shit, it doesn't even feel real for us (demons)
OG sold to those, you called it capo
If those are your drug lords, then who are we?
Hov is the dream of a true black
My only goal is to make a real black feel seen
Sometimes, it makes a false black hate life
It was never my intention, the consequences are my way of life
The way we used to play with life
Now I am careful with the sentences, only those bars I like (woo)
I never wanted to be the state custodian (come on)
The laws of draconian (come on, hov)
For those who married life (come on), it's holy marriage and (come on)
Somehow, I will overcome each box in which they will try to throw me (come on)
With great ceremony and
Folk and they told me how much Caddy talked about him
And uncle and that from London, Harold Road, Weston Inn
I speak to the souls of men
Those are willing to die for the existence that this cold world has chosen for them
Removing the snow of a frozen timb (Woo)
Round trip on this toll highway, it really passed them an invoice
Many soldiers fallen in these paths of sin
For those who make the laws, I always have smoke for them
I have lawyers like shooters
Working pro bono for him as a favor because I throw them the m
In Teel Memory
I pray that none of yours die on prison phones again
All this pain from the outside, inspired all this inner growth
So the new aircraft break
Highest elevation of the self
They fucked and gave blacks the right wealth
These are not songs, they are hymns because I am him
It is Psalm 151, this New Testament
Job's book (HPV's book)
Jesus turned the water into wine, for hov, only one stove was needed
You never know how this shit could go
Biggs and I probably made ourselves too big if they don't reserve that burden (what's up, Hoffa?)
The retrospective is 20/20
Although you are receiving a lot of money, looking back now, this shit is funny
I just received one million synchronization
Without risking a million years trying to get him out of the sink (Woo)
Great Hov
They said they don't know me internationally, blacks on the road did it
I see a lot of Hov in Giggs
Meek and I could never fight, I released that black from a complete offer
Hov did it
The next time we have a discussion about who is the G.O.A.T., your donkeys know
Forgive me, that's my passion talking (haha)
Sometimes I feel like Farrakhan (haha) talking to Mike Wallace (haha)
I think everyone should remain silent
My heart breaks (haha)
God did it

[Pre-stribe: Fridayy & Jay-Z]
They loved us bass, oh-oh-oh (come on, friend)
But look at us now, oh-oh
They told us
They didn't think we would achieve it, OH-OH-OH
They did not believe in us, OH-OH

[Chorus: fridayy]
But I know that God did it, God did it (oh, yes, he did)
Oh God did (oh, yes, he did)
Oh God did (oh-oh)
Oh yes, God did (oh-oh)
Oh, God did it
But I know that God did it, God did it (oh, yes, he did)
Oh, God did (oh, God did)
Oh yes, God did (he did)
Oh yes, God did

[Outro: John Legend]
Yes
You may not believe, but I know that God did it
Oh God did (God did it)
God did (God made)
Oh oh oh
But I know that God did it
He did it
Oh, did, yes, yes
God did it
God did it
God did it
