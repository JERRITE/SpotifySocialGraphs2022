BFF Lyrics [Lyrics "BFF" FT. Lil Krystallll]

[Chorus: Lovesomamama]
My dragdler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My friend-deiler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My plug, ohh my god loves me
I'll take everything I need, he is always happy with me
My Plug So Hot, my plug
My super, my super-duper plug
[Verse 1: Lovesomemama]
To hell with their bouquets, give me the garden
I pack snow on the trap, exhale gas
My money is higher than me
Even if I'm in heels
You, you are the same as everyone else
But only you have everything
You are the same as they are
But only you have a zip
Ice, Ice, Ice, Ice Baby
Chris Jenner, I know Price, Baby, Ice Baby
I can do anything, Baby, said so
I behave as I want, I take my cash

[Bridge: Lil Krystallll]
Mom showed her son to eat the glory
Mom told how to smoke marijuana
She has so many sons, and everyone is boiled
But she loves everyone, because she is mom

[Chorus: Lovesomamama]
My dragdler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My friend-deiler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My Plug, ohh my God loves me (What the Fuck?)
I'll take everything I need, he is always happy with me
My Plug So Hard, my plug
My super, my super-duper plug

BFF Mom, Alya, in Sims we play together
Gucci is tied with a belt
Like love is not mine
On our track love
Mom on a block with a bag
The nose is faded, and what?
Mom Toolie with dick
In Tsum, we shop together, she
There is a house on Rublevka, she is
We live in this house, she
We sing in this house, she
I ate my mother breakfast and began to live better
Mom has plans, we and her along the way
The segment of cartridges filled the clip
Fakbo fell, I took it pi
Mom Fasiet, I will give Dope eighty-Three
These interest are far away from you
Cuts so cleanly, throw on the scales
Russian Post will deliver all dust

[Chorus: Lovesomamama]
My dragdler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My friend-deiler loves me
I love me, bitch, dragdler
My Plug, ohh my God loves me (What the Fuck?)
I will collect everything I need, he is always happy with me
My Plug So Hard, my plug
My super, my super-duper plug2embed
