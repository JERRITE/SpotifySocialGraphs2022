Obsession (is not love) [Spanish version] Lyrics [letter of "obsession (not love) [Spanish version]"]

[Introduction: Baby Bash]
Check, Check
This Happened for Real
Baby Bash
I, Frankie J, Obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
I have not slept anything
And it is already early
No more thinking about how I'm doing my wife
YOUR KISK FREED ME
And I don't understand how it grows
I can't hold this love deeply
[Pre-car: Frankie J]
It is five in the morning
And I can't sleep
No more thinking about how to be with you
I feel useless without you
I don't know what I'm going to do if you're not here, baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Love is not love
(If not love) is an illusion so full of pain
Love is not love
(If not love) is an obsession inside my heart

[Verse 2: Frankie J]
I know you don't belong to me
I know you have someone else
But I know you don't want it for your way of speaking
And I know that you will leave me
Continue with my calls
Maybe I would exchange your way of thinking
And I don't care if you are with him
I just want to make you understand
That I can give you more, more, more than the
It is five in the morning
And I can't sleep
No more thinking about how to be with you
I feel useless without you
I don't know what I'm going to do if you're not here

Love is not love (if not love)
It is an illusion (it is an illusion)
So full of pain
Love is not love (if not love)
It is an obsession (it is an obsession)
Inside my heart

[Bridge: Frankie J]
Ooh, I like how you make me feel
Ooh, I like how you make me feel
Ooh, I like how you make me feel
It is an obsession

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Love is not love (if not love)
It is an illusion (it is an illusion)
So full of pain (so full of pain)
Love is not love (if not love)
It is an obsession (it is an obsession)
Inside my heart
Love is not love (if not love)
It is an illusion (it is an illusion)
So full of pain (so full of pain)
Love is not love (if not love)
It is an obsession (it is an obsession)
Inside my heart
[Outro: Frankie J]
