Daddy’s Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
I signed autographs in the visitation room
Waitin' for you the last time, inmate 502

[Refrain]
Daddy's home

[Verse 2]
You still got it in your government green suit
And I look down and out in my fine Italian shoes
And we're tight as a Bible with the pages stuck like glue
Yeah, you did some time, well, I did some time, too
[Refrain]
Daddy's home

[Interlude]
Ow
Ow
Ow

[Refrain]
Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home
Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home

[Verse 3]
Well, all good Puritans, they'll pray about reform
You swore you had paid your dues, then put a PayDay into your uniform
We're all born innocent, but some good saints get scrеwed
Well, hell, whеre can you run when the outlaw's inside you?

[Outro]
Ow
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
Yeah
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
