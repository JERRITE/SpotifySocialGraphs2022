Nanana Lyrics [chorus: Malik Montana]
I will never let your son hungry
When he turns four, he will start making pumps
My wife does not wear golden rollers on her feet
I used to sleep on the floor, now I have money there
Travel without luggage - I buy on the spot
Reflex - when I meet her, I apply rubber
I feed the bitch, her boyfriend is spitting
Nanana, Nanana, Nanananana

[Verse 1: diho]
Only God thinks us, but the system punishes us
I will bet wrong
To give dirty paper, as if you were rubbing a sraga
And then he picked up in the ground
There are plenty of cameras like on showup
On the burning here I fly
With ballet rats like in a channel
Timberland today I sink them
It's a flare on blocks like a flame at matches
I leave my friends to my colleagues
You won't stop on your feet when my people visit you
Your lips will not say anything
It burns like a fire and flows like water
And everything changes every season
And this Gouda is almost like a Volga
I will make a career here for concrete
Because he goes inside as if I was doing a child
I am pulling out this money for it
Crazy people are only afraid of the badge, never anyone else
Place of business Poland, Get Money Live Life
Don't listen to anyone else
[Chorus: Malik Montana]
I will never let your son hungry
When he turns four, he will start making pumps
My wife does not wear golden rollers on her feet
I used to sleep on the floor, now I have money there
Travel without luggage - I buy on the spot
Reflex - when I meet her, I apply rubber
I feed the bitch, her boyfriend is spitting
Nanana, Nanana, Nanananana

[Wave 2: Białas]
I drank a year ago, it doesn't suit me, I know
Until I have a son, Mordo, I watch how the fejm is growing
(SB maffija) is the best on the stage
And this is true homie, after all we all have such an impression, no?
But you only know when B decides that he has won something?
When it is so great, the fuck will have a volcano
I do it to earn, but I will never be a whore - promise?
I fuck what is fashionable, and this is how your woman seems to be
Do you want to pull the strings here? This, type, there is a roller blind
All people point you with fingers like a tablet
I keep caught up, how to wander the plate, neck and fingers
Although I know well that shallow is like fingerprints
Young Białas!

[Chorus: Malik Montana]
I will never let your son hungry
When he turns four, he will start making pumps
My wife does not wear golden rollers on her feet
I used to sleep on the floor, now I have money there
Travel without luggage - I buy on the spot
Reflex - when I meet her, I apply rubber
I feed the bitch, her boyfriend is spitting
Nanana, Nanana, Nanananana
I will never let your son hungry
When he turns four, he will start making pumps
My wife does not wear golden rollers on her feet
I used to sleep on the floor, now I have money there
Travel without luggage - I buy on the spot
Reflex - when I meet her, I apply rubber
I feed the bitch, her boyfriend is spitting
Nanana, Nanana, Nanananana
