My Baby Gives It Away LyricsMy baby wakes in the deep of the night
She doesn't need it, but she says it's all right
My baby digs him 'cause I'm rollin' away
My baby gives it up every day
My baby gives it, she gives it away
My baby gives it up every day
My baby, she just gives it away

When you're alone in some city hotel
You can get comforted by ringing a bell
You might go pick up a girl on the street
But my baby gives it up totally free
My baby's countin' won't  cause you alarm
My baby's brother never break-a your arm
My baby, ha ha, I love her
She's cheap
Oooooooooh yeah
Oooooooooh
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

You better buy yourself a new pair of shoes
And walk for a lifetime on the page you knew
You better buy yourself a 'lectric guitar
You better play, there's no other way to beat the blues
I beat 'em!

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby

She gives it away, every day, every way
My baby just gives it away
My baby
You might also likeMy baby's momma is a singular girl
She brought up her daughter and she brought her up well
I'm breathing normal 'cause she took it away
My baby gives it up every day
My baby gives it, she gives it away
My baby gives it up every day

My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
My baby
How I love her, yeah

My baby, my baby, she just gives it away
My baby, my baby, she just gives it away
My baby, my baby, gives it away
Let me tell you, my baby, she just gives it away
My baby, every day
My baby gives it up every day
My baby gives it, just gives it awayEmbed
