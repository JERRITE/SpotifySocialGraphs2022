THE PERFECT OCCASION (REMIX) LYRICS [LETTER OF "THE PERFECT OCCASION (REMIX)" FT. Of the ghetto, Jowell & Randy]

[Pre-car]
Hey
Today is the day I'm going to forget you
Bartender, pass me another tequila that I can't stand, oh, oh
I drowned in tears, ey

[Chorus]
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain
[Verse 1]
Today I vo 'to forget all sorrows
Drown my pain in a drunkenness, huh
Bartender, give me another bottle
Today is the day I'm going to forget her
I want to delete tape
Until I no longer resist
Sometimes women are not how they paint
And God will know if loving is another drunk
Or a Mexican or a catracha

[Bridge 1]
If she left and will not return
What are I supposed to do?
And although I don't want to forget it
I can't with this pain
If she left and will not return
What are I supposed to do? Oh
And although I don't want to forget it
I can't with this pain

[Chorus]
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain

I had never met such a beautiful woman
Some of you have to kill me, snatches me
I had never met such a beautiful woman
Some of you have to kill me, snatches me

[Verse 2]
The ghetto
Slowly as she moves her body
A Blunt cacha, a little by José Cuervo
HMM, Hey, A Couple of Shots of Petron
Walking from La’o as if it were prevented

[Bridge 3]
I ', so listen to this song
Forget the penalties, it is the perfect occasion
I ', so listen to this song
Forget the penalties, it is the perfect occasion

[Pre-car]
Today is the day I'm going to forget you
Bartender, pass me another tequila that I can't stand, oh, oh
I drowned in tears, ey

[Chorus]
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain
And that's why this is the perfect occasion
For me to forget her and heal this pain
[Bridge 1]
If she left and will not return
What are I supposed to do?
And although I don't want to forget it
I can't with this pain
If she left and will not return
What are I supposed to do? Oh
And although I don't want to forget it
I can't with this pain

[Verse 3]
Kumba, kumba and something that abuse
I remember that moment when we were together
From so much baby you are confined
Everything is given, do you think it's fair? (Aight)
Today I have to hesitate to forget her
Today I am not going to cry any more, it is not worth it, no

[Outro]
Hey, this is our way of turning a success into a classic
What you and your corrillo would like to do, but they can't
We are simply very advanced 'them
We are too much adenlanta'o, too much
Hey, this is the remix (this is the perfect occasion)
Aight! The true remix (Jowell & Randy)
The Loose (from the Ghetto)
Next to the most valuable, enjoyment (enjoyment)
The ghetto
DJ Jean, Dexter & Mister Green
Santana, the green baby (Life Music)
Jah, Wilo, they already know what kind ’e combo, what awaited them
Aguantensen, Aight?
Enjoyment, compadres
Swears by law I am the most valuable
Aight? The smallest
