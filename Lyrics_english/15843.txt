Your mouth lyrics ["your mouth" ft. José Cury, Vallejo, JD Music]

[Saying: Vallejo]
Kissing your mouth was
Tremendous note that I don't know how to explain the sensation
That I felt at the moment that your lips get wet
Your mind asks to kiss you
Like the other times
I don't see na 'I just follow your voice

[Chorus: Beéle]
Kissing your mouth was (Yeh)
Go to heaven and see you again (turn to)
And feel the feeling
That we feel you and me
When we kiss
For a long time
On four walls locked
We are left
[Verse: José Cury]
You know that I want to do you
You are alone Mami Vente
I send you the location you don't miss
Lostate a note that explodes
You go crazy, if with a kiss I roso your mouth
We are in four twenty mind, I know everyone believes that I am insane
But it is not necessary to have much coefficient
To realize that you want a burning night with me
Don't think so much and give it
That without realizing the party we escape
What is pending we finished it
You tell me where and we hard

[Pre-car: Vallejo]
Sometimes I feel
That I dream awake
Because I found what I was looking for a long time ago

[Chorus: Beéle]
Kissing your mouth was (Yeh)
Go to heaven and see you again (turn to)
And feel the feeling
That we feel you and me
When we kiss
For a long time
On four walls locked
We are left

Let's put into practice
What you and I feel
That today we live
I like you about you
I don't know how to describe it
But I don't have to say it either
Sometimes I feel
That I dream awake
Because I found what I was looking for a long time ago

[Pre-Caro: Beéle]
Sometimes I feel
That I dream awake
Because I found what I was looking for for a long time

[Saying: Vallejo]
Kissing your mouth was
Tremendous note that I don't know how to explain the sensation
That I felt at the moment that your lips get wet
Your mind asks to kiss you
Like the other times
I don't see na 'I just follow your voice

[Chorus: Beéle]
Kissing your mouth was (Yeh)
Go to heaven and see you again (turn to)
And feel the feeling
That we feel you and me
When we kiss
For a long time
On four walls locked
We are left
