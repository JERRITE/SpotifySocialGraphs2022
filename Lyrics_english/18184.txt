Mexico Lyrics [words of "Mexico"]

[Verse 1: ADEMO]
Every day it is the monde of whores that I see
Every day I prevail that it is on the moon that I am shooting
Tell the judge that we did it to survive
I saw the world, I still want it oh yes
Oh yes we grew up a bit wild, Mowgli (Mowgli)
Don't you understand me? Me3lich my brother, forget
Each good-tank I was able to suspend
It seems that you are looking for me? I'm there, I love, if if
HMM, HMM, HMM
Don't worry that we are strong, that we are hard, that we take normal
Wesh of course that I see from the suburbs, of course if you come from the 16th I do the normal bicrave
Eh, eh, eh, eh
No fairy tale, the tramp does not please the beautiful
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Petasse we contamch you when the Ient-Cli calls
Yeah, I am this kind of cassos who flirts with English in Spanish
The vida loca chiquita, bambina, make your crazy (make your crazy, make your crazy, make your crazy)
There I write my text in the cellar, my future in sawfall
With my leather on the back on which I fell asleep at 36
Yeah yeah yeah
[Refrain: Ademo]
I have hatred like in Mexico
I mirror like in Mexico City
The loose to Mexico City
In the head it's Mexico
Every day it's war
We have to do it at Mexico
Always the finger in the air
Arriba, Arriba Mexico
I have hatred like in Mexico
I mirror like in Mexico City
The loose to Mexico City
In the head it's Mexico
Every day it's war
We have to do it at Mexico
Always the finger in the air
Arriba, Arriba Mexico

[Verse 2: N.O.S.
Yeah, Judas wants to kiss me yeah
He believes that I would be famous
My hatred lights the darkness
We are the MIF â€™and the sorrel
My heart is double call
We move away from angels is better
They should not take their wings
Alone, my shadow with asylum
I suckle the second eyebrow
We place the f and we kille
I gave too much the taste of my tears
I have a grain, I roll up a seed
I have some projects that are born
All fertilized by hatred
There's nothing to do and my retina turns thumbs
So I lock my eyes, and the darkness I marry
That they do not have their mother, Igo I'm not like them
I count alone in the hall, my bundle resonates
In the pocket, I am counting, I have how much
I deviate from the borders of the good
Farm penalty The trunk contains
Everything for mine
You might also like [Refrain: Ademo]
I have hatred like in Mexico
I mirror like in Mexico City
The loose to Mexico City
In the head it's Mexico
Every day it's war
We have to do it at Mexico
Always the finger in the air
Arriba, Arriba Mexico
I have hatred like in Mexico
I mirror like in Mexico City
The loose to Mexico City
In the head it's Mexico
Every day it's war
We have to do it at Mexico
Always the finger in the air
Arriba, Arriba Mexico
