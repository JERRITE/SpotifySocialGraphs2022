To below Lyrics [letter from "to down"]

[Intro: Kevin Roldán]
Hi babe
The attraction between you and me
It is another 'level', and another thing
A sweet sensation (feeling; I love you)
I noticed you for a while
I know he also wants' and that's why I stuck (Yeah)
You 'tá equally mamacita as in the photo, baby
[Choir: Kevin Roldán]
How rich you giving it down
As a snake, to the rhythm of the bass
What need do you have to tempt me like this?
What need do you have to touch you like this?
I want to take you for my room
Have me jumping
I on your skin watering the tussi
A fantasy, you and me in ecstasy, yes

[Saying: Kevin Roldán]
She is Chiquitica and with the 'Nalga' Grandota '(Grandota')
Loquita when I kissed her, I hit her to the wall
The baby loves and it shows

[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
What was there, baby, where is it '? I just landed in Medellín
I want to feel you, where are you going to go, I want you
I want to ride as if it were jockey
Get off the Cherokee
Ride you at the Mercedes and take you from Shopping
Put to sing like a karaoke
The ex -husband is listed as the logo 'e miwaukee
It seemed of legal age since he was in high school
It has a picket that the envious' makes them angry
As a gift, I won it without throwing lip
I took her to point G touching her 'area'
Baby, I had this one with Varia '
But your crazy brings me ', that's what attracts me
That looks shy, but brings them
How I kissed you and touched you, back I placed you
That bumper I shocked you

How rich you giving it down
As a snake, to the rhythm of the bass
What need do you have to tempt me like this?
What need do you have to touch you like this?
I want to take you for my room
Have me jumping
I on your skin watering the tussi
A fantasy, you and me in ecstasy, yes

[Verse 2: Lyanno]
Tell me, Baby, what vamo 'to do?
If you are here, undress
Trépeate 'e me, come, fancy
Pa 'not forget and love you again
Your body needs me, my mouth requests you
Put on the cremita to have you soft
Lie on the bed, baby, open
And I left the condone 'in case the latex irritates you
Tell me, Baby, what vamo 'to do?
If you are here, undress
Trépeate 'e me, come, fancy
Pa 'not forget and love you again

[Verse 3: Kevin Roldán]
Hey
I start your skirt, back as you complete
You like to put it in looking at the caleta
Telling you to ear rudeness'
And that forgot 'of that fool, that you are mine
Your movement, your mouth
How does it ', how touches you'
I want to tear off those clothes
In another dimension traveling
Your whole body exploring (body exploring)
[Choir: Kevin Roldán]
How rich you giving it down
As a snake, to the rhythm of the bass
What need do you have to tempt me like this?
What need do you have to touch you like this?
I want to take you for my room
Have me jumping
I on your skin watering the tussi
A fantasy, you and me in ecstasy, yes

[Outro: Kevin Roldán]
She is Chiquitica and with the 'Nalga' Grandota '
Mauro Dembow released me Beat
To give it Esquilin, Quilinembed
