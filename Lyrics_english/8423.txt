Lyrics Set [Lyrics for "Tambo"]

[Enter: OMY OF GOLD]
Third, you don't love you itself '
Tell the new one who spends asking for me your pillow
That I already made you to ’in that bed
He ate Miley, but he won't know what Hannah is eating, Yeah

[Saying: Amarion]
Semarf (section), Cupid threw me a weap
And I already put the fifty to twenty -two and a bandana in my head to the Rambo
Endemonia'o and Super Saiyan as the Lambo
Baby, Fuck You (Fuck You)
I caught the bastard by shining with your new jevo
And now I think the culprit of this and 'he, not you (not you)
That this was for a lifetime and that Eramo 'inseparable'
All that e 'not True (Not True)
Third, now I remember to 'lo' "Where?" And to 'lo' "When?"
If not e ’with me, then’ go from the other side
I ate you and I no longer 'toy lunch
[Choir: Amarion & OMY of gold]
Baby, I still have ’the fuse
They were the 'heart' and the arrow (and the arrow)
I know that what sow 'e ’what is harvested
And you miss me 'to date, Baby (OMY)
I still have 'the fuse (ey)
They were the 'heart' and the 'arrow
I know that what sow 'e' whatever is harvested (ey, listen, baby)
And you miss me 'to date, Baby

[Verse 1: OMY GOLD]
I know that you miss me ', but apparently (-Cer)
Cupid's bastard seeks to fuck
He doesn't love you with me, he prefers to see you with him
But when you see me ', the' eye 'shines you like my cartier, ah
You don't change 'the Mood (Mood)
You played badly, you didn't pass the Approve ('supply)
Total the one you lost is you (you)
Your memory I buried in a coffin, Yeh
Ours died with yesterday
I am no longer the sun of your 'sunecere'
Keep with him, calm, don't wait for me '
There is no wound that time does not recover
I changed your 'discussion' by pleacer '(OMY)

[Choir: OMY DE ORO & AMARION]

And you miss me 'to date (mmm, baby)
I still have 'the fuse
They were the 'heart' and the arrow
I know that what sowed 'e' whatever is harvested
And you miss me 'to date

And I think this 'wins' that I have do not go and will last until old
I walk with "and if you see it" from Ñejo
I do not smoke because even giving the pen, I call you, I put an asshole
That bastard convinced me not to be palg
The bad of forgetting and 'that always remembers' something
He sent me hot at close range with your 'kiss' on his ship
And if the 'pillo' are not arrow ', which commands the one who commissioned
Having you gave me hard as Tyson
I fuck another 'babie', but with the 'same' song 'of Bryson
Cupid was guided
But let that bastard know that the day he see us 'what is e' in Warzone

[Saying: Amarion]
Fuck you (Fuck you)
I caught the bastard by shining with your new jevo
And now I think the culprit of this and 'he, not you (not you)
That this was for life and that Eramo 'inseparable'
All that e 'not true

[Outro: OMY de Oro & Amarion]
I still have 'the fuse
They were the 'heart' and the arrow
I know that what sowed 'e' whatever is harvested
And you miss me 'to date
Baby (omeh, omeh, omeh, omeh, omeh), seh, seh
Seh, seh (indicates, moorion)
SEH (Young Boss)
'Te e' Amarion (tell me, Ecua)
The 'Babie' are of it ', but I' put osotro '
I 'put us ’, baby (hello? Tell me fast that I can't speak)
Third, you don't love you itself '
Tell the new one who spends asking for me your pillow
That I already did everything in this bed
He ate Miley, but he won't know what he is eating Hannahembed
