Crazy stranger lyricsquisquis would be able to explain
How could I fall in love
Of someone who is just
The voice and nothing else

Maybe you have made me understand
That without touching you can be
The story of a love that is
It feeds us to the heart

And you want to start again
To give me back
And you give me the words that
They will shout a I love you
I'm the one who came to smile
Who became part of you a strange crazy
I am your idea your imagination
Your vague idea of ​​love and open your arms

And I can give you a little more
I will take care of every moment that is the two, you?

And although you see you never saw you
I know I live for you
I knew since I was born
I knew and now I am here

Time takes to arrive
Maybe we are waiting
And look how chance
Nice to love you

And you want to start again
To give me back
And you give me the words that
They will shout very strongly I love you

I'm the one who came to smile
Who became part of you a strange crazy
I am your idea your imagination
Your vague idea of ​​love and open your arms
You might also like you can give you a little more of all
I will take care of every moment that is the two, you and me

I'm the one who came to smile
Who became part of you a strange crazy
I am your idea your imagination
Your vague idea of ​​love and open your arms

And I can give you a little more
I will take care of every moment that is the two, you? Embed
