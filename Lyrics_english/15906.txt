Lyrics kilometers [letter from '' kilometers '']

[Verse 1: Noel]
Several hundred kilometers
Your voice can give me heat just like a sun
And I feel how a harmonic change
It composes a song inside me

[Verse 2: Leonel, Noel & Leonel]
I know that continuing does not sound logical
But I don't forget your magic perfume
And in this telephone meeting
I remembered that I am crazy about you
[Chorus: Noel & Leonel]
That everyone fits on the phone
That there are no great distances for our love
That everything is perfect when I feel you
So close though you're so far away

[Verse 3: Noel & Leonel]
Several hundred kilometers
My pain has a secret to tell you
As soon as you hang the phone
Will stay thinking my heart

[Chorus: Noel & Leonel]
That everyone fits on the phone
That there are no great distances for our love
That everything is perfect when I feel you
So close though you're so far away
That everyone fits on the phone
That there are no great distances for our love
That everything is perfect when I feel you
So close even if you are so far away might also like2embed
