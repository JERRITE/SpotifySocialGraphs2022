What you do not know Lyrics [intro]
We are from the Caribbean Oite 'Crazy
Supreme

[Pre-car: Nacho]
If you knew
What it feels like
To be without you
You would return
I could not stand
See me suffer
In this way
If you knew
If you knew
What it feels like
To be without you
You would return
I could not stand
See me suffer
In this way
If you knew
[Chorus: Chinese]
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
The heart beats me only when you are your side
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu

[Verse 1: Nacho]
I walk around the world derail'o
I don't know why you have left
Tell me now why have you left me
Spoiled
If you know that I have given everything to you
That only that happens when it is to me the '
Tell me now because they leave me
Forget
Come tell me if you are case with another person
To see if this fool finally forgets and reacts
Come tell me why right the mind does not work for me
At the moment no human being reason
With you raised a thousand flights
But now I'm on the floor
If I see you walking hand in hand with another they kill my jealousy
With a word of comfort
Heaven falls on me
When I remember
Your eyes, your mouth, your hand, your body, your hair
[Chorus: Chinese]
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
The heart beats me only when you are your side
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu

[Verse 2: Potro Alvarez]
Baby, i like you
Only you
You have the body, movement, attitude
Come with me that I am a new man
I know you are Crew fan
GIVE Maraca that the foal attacks you
Of the Park La Saca Traca Traca Traca de Caraca '
I am the misconduct, the Bad Boy
If you knew that I throw myself head in the first
I take my mi are and beat him
It gives me to 'when I see you
There is a baby I know that you are burning
It is already difficult for me to fall that fly

[Verse 3: Nacho]
You like the tucu tucu tucu tucu tucu tucu your evil
Chinese and Nacho, El Potro and Baroni arrived
Daniel and Jean
The owners of the Pope country
This is not learned by
This is born crazy
[Verse 4: Baroni One Time]
Being without you is like dying
Living without you is something that I don't understand Girl
So, eat with me because this is our time
I and you together, there you you forever
Being without you is like dying
Living without you is something that I don't understand Girl
So, eat with me because this is our time
I and you together, there you you forever

[Chorus: Chinese]
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
The heart beats me only when you are your side
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu
What you don't know, you (what you don't know)
Is that my love is you you you tu tu (is that my love you are)
And he gets excited and sounds tucu tucu tucu tu tucu tu

[Outro]
If you knew
What it feels like
To be without you
You would return
I could not stand
See me suffer
In this way
If you knew
