Black and Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Black and blue I crawl along
The wreckage of what now is gone
Back to you to fight another day
I'll go on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I'm facing the demons I created with every last part of me
The pain will fade
And I'll go on and on and on and on
I'm facing the demons I created with every last part of me
The pain will fade
And I'll go on and on and on and on
Black and blue I crawl to you
Black and blue I crawl to you

[Verse 2]
Black and blue I crawl along
The wreckage of what now is gone
Back to you to fight another day
I'll go on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I'm facing the demons I created with every last part of me
The pain will fade
And I'll go on and on and on and on
I'm facing the demons I created with every last part of me
The pain will fade
And I'll go on and on and on and on

Black and blue I crawl to you
Black and blue I crawl to youYou might also likeEmbed
