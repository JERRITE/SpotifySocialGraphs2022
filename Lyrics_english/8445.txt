Our love is like that [lyrics of "our love is like that"]

[Intro]
Oh oh
Magnate (Yeh-Yeh-Yeh)
Mambo Kingz

[Pre-car]
What time are you going to be?
If possible now call
Please answer, I beg you
Your parents are no longer
Now we can talk
I can't take it anymore, I despair, uoh-uoh
[Chorus]
Our love is like that, you there and I here
I die for you, tell me what I do with this?, No
Our love is like that, you and I here (eh-eh-eh-eh)
I die for you, do I tell what I do with this?

[Post-car]
No, no, oh, no (tell me what do I do with this?)
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I can't take it anymore, not one more day
Waiting for the moment you can love
When will end, what else? I don't know what to do
I consumed this loneliness, this loneliness, baby (no)

[Chorus]
Our love is like that, you there and I here
I die for you, tell me what I do with this?, No
Our love is like that, you and I here (eh-eh-eh-eh)
I die for you, tell me what I do with this?, No

[Verse 2]
Tell me what can I do without you?
How do I get used to you?
My love, I miss you (Ouh)
Scale or I will go, here I will fight
If even if you want, I will insist
You Might Also Like [Choir]
Our love is like that, you there and I here
I die for you, tell me what I do with this?, No
Our love is like that, you and I here (eh-eh-eh-eh)
I die for you, do I tell what I do with this?

[Post-car]
No, no, oh, no (tell me what do I do with this?)
Oh, no, no, no

[Outro]
