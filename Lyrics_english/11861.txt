You walk in my head lyricsletra of "You walk in my head" ft. Daddy Yankee

[Enter: Nacho]
Looking for me
Make me silly, for what?
If I don't care about anything
I prefer to live and lose that I have not lived anything
If you leave, I will stay in a pain that I never met

[Pre-car: Nacho]
Like sand in the wind
Without a compass, without direction, stepping and thirsty
The same as loving a human without soul in the body
If you leave, I will stay in a pain that I never met
[Choir: Nacho, Chino & Daddy Yankee]
You walk in my head, baby, at all hours
I don't know how to explain you, huh
The world spins me, you get out of control
I don't stop thinking about you, huh
I spend the imagining that, imagining that
With you I married, hey
And forever I loved you
Love you, girl, girl, girl, lo-lo-love you
You walk in my head, baby, at all hours
Every second, every minute
The world turns me, you get out of control (Yeah)
Every second, every minute
I spend it by imagining that
Imagining what
With you I married, hey
And forever I loved you

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
(We read now)
Imagine that you know 'what you don't know' (YEP; YEP)
I become a wolf after 12 (YEP)
If my wolf did not have to decorate it (YEP)
I go with the pack that destroys me
Because on the street there is a lot
The good is always corrupted, huh, eh
But I don't want another woman taking advantage (YEP)
When you are the one that I love (ey)
Girl, I would never dare to leave you alone (YEP)
Chiqui-Chiqui-Chiquitica never alone
For you I kept my gun
Gaticas do not control me
Tas' doubting, I know
But he loves me 'at the same time (eh)
He just asks him to give you, My Love
GIVE YOU, MY LOVE, GIVE YOU

[Bridge: Chino & Daddy Yankee]
If you go
Love dies
The one you give me
And the pain comes
I will be a tramp
Only in this world
Aimless
Aimlessly
If you leave (you go)
Love dies (love)
The one you give me (you give me)
And pain comes (and pain comes)
I will be a vagabund (Ouh-Yeh)
Only in this world
Aimless (aimless)
Aimlessly
[Verse 2: Nacho & Daddy Yankee]
Chinese and Nacho!
You are my muse, you are my lyrics, you are my harmony
You are the water that drowns me the melancholy
Chino and Nacho and Daddy Yankee brought you this melody (Yeah)
Converted into poetry, baby
Pa â€™What enjoyed and hesites, you see '(Daddy)
Romantic but we make him brutal
Master Celis! (Wuh; No, Guara, No-No-No-No, Guara-Baby)

[Choir: Nacho, Chino & Daddy Yankee]
You walk in my head, baby, at all hours (D-D, Dy, Gaby Music!)
The world turns me, you get out of control
(Chino and Nacho, Baby; Wuh)
For you I imagine that (Jumbo "he who produces alone"!)
With you I got married
And forever I loved you
Love You Girl, Girl, Girl, Lo-Lo-Love, Love
You walk in my head, baby, at all a few hours
Every second, every minute
The world turns me, you get out of control (Yeah)
Every second, every minute
I spend it by imagining that
Imagining what
With you, I got married, Ouh-Yeh
And forever I loved you
