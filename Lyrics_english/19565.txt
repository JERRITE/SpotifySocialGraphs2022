Genius Freestyle 001 Lyrics[Verse]
Uh, this the type of shit you should avoid if you could
I always root for the villain, baby, surely I'm good
Watching all of you niggas jump out the window with all that fuck shit
You like Tre from “Boyz n the Hood”
Met Gala, flyest, no I don't need a stylist
My blood is deep rooted, Jimmy Fallon niggas scatter
Success is overthinking shit that really matters
I get it rappers, a pound of beats and a pinch of talent
Include your chain and your bitch, I, too, would be distracted
Banana boat killers with 9 mil-ers to peel ya backwards
Blazer on me like I’m into fashion
Lesane Parish passion
Rappers die broke but know the fame’s everlasting
Clubber Lang, chain swing, I’m not the one to match with
Love if you nasty
Lady said she a sag, yes
We savages, give the competition my ass to kiss
You motherfuckers asked for this
Smooth killers doing drive-bys to Maxwell hits
“Pretty Wings” on that new car, the classic shit
Bitter sweet I’m the perfect blend of class and savageness
Just think, they used to laugh at NickYou might also like2Embed
