Bang It To The Curb Lyrics[Intro]
B-bang it
B-bang it to the curb
B-bang it

[Hook]
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Bangin down the block with my Remy bottle
Reppin 213, California lotto
Servin all the fiends like King Taco
My cheese, nachos, flossin til ya unfollow
Windows down the 'Lac, just an ass crack
Nothin but the Alpine system on smash
Hit the stash in the dash, better puff puff pass
Flyin faster than the 5-0, bang it to the curb!
[Hook]
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb
Oh word, we absurd
Got that fire, we can burn
B-bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb

[Hook]
B-bang it
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
F1 Indy hoes burning my rubbers
4 rooms at the motel undercover
Player clique cruising LA in a 4Runner
Pop the hatchback booty slappin like my subwoofer
Slip slidin thru ya house word to Dogg Pound
Fat beats for that kitty from the underground
Hit up Sidney Samson if ya need a fat fix
Lootin liquor stores time to flick the match sticks

Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb
Oh word, we absurd
Got that fire, we can burn
B-bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Nothin but that fat bass for that fat ass
With my 808 on blast
Nothin but that fat bass for that fat ass
With my 808 on blast
Nothin but that fat bass for that fat ass
With my 808 on blast

[Hook]
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb
Bang it
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb
Hit the turn, flip the bird
Bust a bitch, make'm swerve
B-bang it to the curb
