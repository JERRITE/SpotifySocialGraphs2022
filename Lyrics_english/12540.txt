Artifact Lyrics [intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Skrrt
(Phillip)

[Stanza]
I have four piles and aruse them in the air (in the air)
On three throats with which I swept (I am)
He asks me "Azteca, what my dick do you have?"
I'm broken, make, from mold (mold)
Ha, Ha, I pull mold
Or artifact, finally, what you said (artifact)
We break the scene, me with Ian and Nane (Nane)
It hurts in the three-panta (panarame) dick
We fuck them, brother, all, come on (come on)
Fainting that I give them back on the back (on the back)
I have four pussies and smoke again again
Four-i count my fateful and seem
That's why I always say, it's magic (it's magic)
I no longer put pirae, like Maggi (like Maggi)
Who my dick does me, Fra '?
Let me break after that, say "Where's the bathroom?" (The bathroom)
I Gucci, you don't know, with Balenciaga
It hurts me in the heart of Cox, not from her
Skrrt, skrrt
Pizza leaves me a vast impression (Skrrt)
Tells me that a bad joke
Makes her tell me 'ceases' (cease)
Can you tell me vegetables are cabbage (that they are cabbage)
Day "hidden on life", Fra ', with me (Fra', with me)
Come on, come, children, with me (with me)
I have money, I have a stanc
Come, brother, Come on after me
Follow me, don't put pills, children
I have money, I have money
I have a pile
[Outro]
