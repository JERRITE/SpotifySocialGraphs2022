If your love does not return to your love
You have never done things for me
The same as I like a fool did for you
You no longer take and do not smoke in meetings because he asked for it
But I know someone can do the same for my love
So no one is going to break my heart
Well, you did it and you long next to him

And if your love does not come back
I will have to settle for photographs
I will have to make an album of your joys
And all the moments I lived with you
I will be a collector if your love does not come back
Painting the walls with so much memory
Scratching life with so much silence
Crying like a child because I don't have you
And it is that a damn Imbecil I rob my dreams
I have wounded my heart
And today I bleed my song
I can't be without you anymore

For your love
I give up my life for living your life
Reveries my dreams for living your dreams
And today long and also give you luxury
To tell them

I will hate you
If you don't come back there is no remedy, I'll hate you
And even if it seems absurd time I will love you
Well, it's clear, I don't know how to live without you

And if your love does not come back
My soul will go looking for you away from my body
Loaded two suitcases full of silence
Fleeing from failure because I don't have you
And it is that a damn imbecil I rob me your body

I have wounded my heart
And today I bleed my song
I can't be without you anymore

And if your love does not come back
I will have to settle for photographs
I will have to make an album of your joys
And all the moments I lived with you
I will be a collector if your love does not come back
Painting the walls with so much memory
Scratching life with so much silence
Fleeing from failure because I don't have you
And it is that a damn imbecil I rob me your body
I will have to settle for photographs
I will have to make an album of your joys
And all the moments I lived with Tigo
I will be a collector if your love does not come back
