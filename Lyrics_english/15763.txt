Look at her, look at him Lyrics [letter of "Look at her, look at him"]

[Verse 1]
Look at her, look at her, look at her
Goddess dressed in saliva and salt
The eyes dead blank moaning on the lounge floor

[Verse 2]
Look at it, look at it, look at it
Naked angel bathed in sweat
Going up the mountains of your body, do not stop, please
[Pre-Car 1]
At noon wild combat

[Verse 3]
Look at her, look at her, look at her
How is it agitated, as you ask for more
Dies and reborn from the ashes, again on

[Pre-Coro 2]
I enter almost tiptoe and in full gloom
The bonfire on my nightmares

[Chorus]
You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, more than the sky
With a million stars
It is easy to forgive when you want to give up
You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, dangerous and beautiful
Much more than the account
I would have to shout but I bite my tongue

[Verse 4]
Look at her, look at her, look at her
It is disappointed, gets tangled up
A jellyfish under the tide about to shipwrecked

[Verse 5]
Look at it, look at it, look at it
So proud, so sentimental
Asking for pink music, the same thing that makes me sing

At the hypnotized door of my own house
I can't believe it, no matter how much I see it

[Chorus]
You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, more than the sky
With a million stars
It is easy to forgive when you want to give up
You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, dangerous and beautiful
Much more than the account
I would have to shout and I don't move, no

[The end]
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful more than a sunset)
Naked angel bathed in sweat
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, dangerous and beautiful)
Oh, no, why do you do this to me? Tell me
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful more than a sunset)
I see it and I can't believe it
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, too beautiful, love)
Look at it, look at her, ah, ah, ahembed
