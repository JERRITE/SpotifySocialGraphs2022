I leave you free Lyrics [letter from "I leave you free"]

[Verse 1: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
I feel that you do not know me
I feel that touching me now does not matter
You do not care
There are more and more fears
Insecurity grows as ivy

[Verse 2: Ashley Grace]
And it hurts me to see what you try to rescue
What one day in the soul united us
It is no longer there, although you are
It is time to face reality
[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
You like me but I love you
That's the truth
Your presence here is killing me
To feel halfway
I have tired of trying and not achieving
To make you fall in love
I don't want me to hurt me
But I have to release you
Today I leave you free

[Verse 3: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
I don't hate you, there are no grudge
Simply the heart is no longer
Your heart is no longer
Colors are lost
Your hands are not trying to look for

[Verse 4: Hanna Nicole, both]
And they hurt me to see what you try to rescue
What one day in the soul united us
It is no longer there, although you are
It is time to face reality

[Choir: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]
You like me but I love you
That's the truth
Your presence here is killing me
To feel halfway
I have tired of trying and not achieving
To make you fall in love
I don't want me to hurt me
But I have to release you

It hurts me more to follow with you
And see that even with my heat
You still feel cold

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]
You like me but I love you
That's the truth
Your presence here is killing me
To feel halfway
I have tired of trying and not achieving
To make you fall in love
I don't want me to hurt me
But I have to release you
Today I leave you free11mbed
