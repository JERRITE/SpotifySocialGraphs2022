Maybe You Saved Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Christo Bowman]
Movin' in a backwards motion
Trippin' down the streets we'd roam
Fired at me left me frozen
I'm numb to the cold
Crashin' into your conclusion
Spun me like a spider's web
Snappin' out of my delusion
Back into my head

[Pre-Chorus: Christo Bowman]
You watched me crash
You watched me burn
You helped me pick my pieces up
I let you down and in return
You let me know you've had enough
Oh-oh
[Chorus: Christo Bowman]
Ooh, holdin' on was holdin' me down
Ooh, holdin' on, who's holdin' you now?
Maybe you hate me, or
Maybe I'm crazy, or
Maybe you saved me
By lettin' me go
Maybe you saved me
By lettin' me go

[Verse 2: Lynn Gunn]
Fallin' in a forwards motion
Drivin' down the old dirt road
Shaded by the burnt-out trees
From fire flowers grow
I wanna call you up to say
I wanna hear you've found your way
I'm hopin' when the seasons change
We're both in better days

[Pre-Chorus: Lynn Gunn, Christo Bowman]
I watched you crash
I watched you burn
I helped you pick the pieces up
I couldn't give you what you deserved
Sometimes my best ain't good enough
I know you've had enough
Oh-oh

Ooh, holdin' on was holdin' me down
Ooh, holdin' on, who's holdin' you now?
Maybe you hate me, or
Maybe I'm crazy, or
Maybe you saved me
By lettin' me go
Maybe you saved me
By lettin' me go

[Pre-Chorus: Christo Bowman]
I let you down and in return
You let me know you've had enough
Oh-oh

[Chorus: Christo Bowman, Lynn Gunn]
Ooh, holdin' on was holdin' me down
Ooh, holdin' on, who's holdin' you now?
Maybe you hate me, or (Hate me)
Maybe I'm crazy, or (Crazy)
Maybe you saved me (Saved me)
By lettin' me go
Maybe you hate me, or (Maybe you hate me)
Maybe I'm crazy, or (Maybe I'm crazy)
Maybe you saved me (Maybe you saved me)
By lettin' me go
[Outro: Christo Bowman, Lynn Gunn]
Crash-landing back down to Earth
Falling in love in reverse (By letting me go)
Crash-landing back down to Earth
Falling in love in reverse
Crash-landing back down to Earth
Falling in love in reverse (Maybe you saved me)
Crash-landing back down to Earth
Falling in love in reverse (By letting me go)Embed
