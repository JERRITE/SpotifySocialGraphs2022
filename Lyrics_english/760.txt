Unknown Lyrics ["Unknown" ft letter. Manuel Turizo & Camilo]

[Intro: Mau and Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Strangers
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yes Yes

[Pre-Caro: Mau and Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
We are barely two strangers
Eager to kiss
Wanting to happen whatever happens
We are barely two (we are barely two)
Strangers
Fear of falling in love
Fear that whatever happens
[Choir: Mau and Ricky, Manuel Turizo]
Vamo 'to have a good time
If you want, then we fall in love
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it
Vamo 'to have a good time (yes)
If you want, then we fall in love
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it

[Verse 1: Camilo]
Hey, hey, hear me well
You are what I am looking for in a woman
I have you in my sights since I arrived
I feel that you are mine, I don't know why
Oh, I know it's a lie
Say that I am the man of your life
If you did not know me yesterday
And you didn't know what you loved me

[Chorus: Camilo, Mau and Ricky]
Vamo 'to have a good time
And if you want, then we fell in love
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it
Vamo 'to have a good time (a while)
If you want, then we fall in love (then we fell in love)
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it
And the dance 'lirico

I don't know how to explain what I am seeing in you
I love how you are moving
Your star body against my body, ma
I don't understand
Tell me if you were hiding
You so beautiful and I barely knowing you
Let's dance regardless of who is seeing
Today I want to have you with me, with me
I want to have a good time with you, with you
Today I want to have you with me, with me
And see the sunrise with you, with you

[Pre-Coro: Mau and Ricky, Camilo, Mau and Ricky & Manuel Turizo]
We are barely two strangers
Eager to kiss (a fear of falling in love)
Wanting to happen whatever happens
We are barely two
Strangers (two strangers)
Fear of falling in love (wanting to kiss)
Fear that whatever happens

[Choir: Mau and Ricky, Manuel Turizo & Camilo]
Vamo 'to have a good time
If you want, then we fall in love (UOH)
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it
Oh, vamo 'to have a good time (yes)
And if you want, then we fell in love
Vamo 'to have a good time
Step by step, we shit it
