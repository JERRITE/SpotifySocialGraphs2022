Fuck the Opps Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stay safe, fully loaded choppa, nigga I'm eating steak
All you hoes snakes in the grass, I got to cut my shit
You was ridin' with me on the bus, now you talkin' shit
Never been a lame, that's on my mama, yeah they know my name
Taylor Blood way before Cuban, yeah I been the same
That's when I was beatin' little bitches, now I'm getting dough
Yeah, so this tech gotta greet you hoe
Only see me out if I'm gettin' paid for a show
Bands in my pocket, not on my head, cuz you hoes broke
Bitches wanna fight, ain't got no life, get yo mind right
Bitch get out yo feelings talkin' hard like a fuckin' dyke
Man this shit so easy I be doin' it while I'm sleepy
Poppin' pills gettin' geeky
Never been a sellout, get a shoot I go to BelAir
40 with the dick, so you know my shit stand out
Bad yellow bitch, I ain't neva got no handouts
[Hook]
Say they on my head, they ain't drop shit
Ratchet ass weave, that's a mopstick
Have my nigga at yo crib on some hot shit
Steady screamin' fuck the opps bitch

[Verse 2]
Fuck a opp bitch, you a broke bitch
You ain't got shit, you ain't doin' shit
You ain't hittin' licks
You ain't gettin' rich, you a sad bitch
On the gram, you a mad bitch
If I see you you a target
You and that retarded bitch, I'll spit on you with them dirty shoes
Yeah bitch, yo nigga always fuckin' choose
I be with killers, they ain't got shit to lose
Fake ass rappin' bitch, you be buyin' views
Slide down with them poles, have you on the news
Playin' crazy, playin' roles have you on the news
Heard you tellin' on yo niggas, why they wearin' blues?
Never told a soul, I been countin' blues

[Hook]
Say they on my head, they ain't drop shit
Ratchet ass weave, that's a mopstick
Have my nigga at yo crib on some hot shit
Steady screamin' fuck the opps bitchYou might also like3Embed
