[Intro: Cazzu]
Sooner or later I'm going out with mine
And everything 'are going to be a witness'
I'm going to make you feel like never before you had felt
My flow has confused you
I already have you sweating cold
You arrived with her but you leave here with me

[Chorus: Cazzu]
Ah-ah-ah, that face makes me evil
Uncontrolled, I get explicit
And down there I make you a visit
And if you want more ', ah-ah
I give you more to have to take
I promise you that you will not forget
From this crazy, what is crazy, ah
[Verse 1: Maria Becerra]
I promise you
That tonight in bed Haremo 'the best duet (Yeh)
When you look at my eye 'I disconnect
Keep the secret (ay)
Knows' that makes me a restless heart
So vamo 'Let's see who of the do' wins (wins)
I don't want your love but tell me what loves me '
Baby, don't leave me 'with the win' (no-oh)
I want to wake up next to you tomorrow

[Pre-stribe: Maria Becerra]
Touch me, come closer and feel me (ting me, yeah)

That makes me 'malefic
For you I walk, know ', Baby
Take me, come approaching and feel me
I am liked, find out
That makes me 'malefic
For you I walk hysterically, ah-ah-ah

Uncontrolled, I get explicit
And down there I make you a visit
And if you want more ', ah-ah
