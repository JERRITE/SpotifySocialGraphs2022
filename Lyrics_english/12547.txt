Way to Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Surfing the snow
Are you ready for
A revolution to show the way
Seven more weeks until the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
Praise us, memory will change it into old things

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
[Verse 2]
While hearts beat
It's nothing like before
Dreaming is the home of the brave
Future is the healing of pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
Praise us, memory will change it into old things

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again

[Bridge]
Like a cannonball shot across the floor
We have found a way through the darkest hour
Like a cannonball shot across the floor
We have little time for worry

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start againYou might also like3Embed
