Benz | I Know (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Kelvyn Colt]
See I don't need your love
I was there when you would fall
Now you act like you don't know 'bout it
You were not involved
I remember making calls
But no one was picking up on me
You say that I make things complicated
I don't see a need in conversation, no
Now you want a piece, you think I made it
Schemin' on a cake that ain't been baked yet (Ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus: Kelvyn Colt]
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind, yeah

[Verse 2: GASHI]
Turn the city to the Autobahn, 'bout ninety-five
Evеry time that I drive, fuck Polizei
Pull mе over to the side, I take your ticket
Break my weed and get high, I'm fine
Different kind of Benzes, we not racist
Five percentage, I don't see no haters
All my shqipe saying: "GASHI made it"
Roll the windows down, look at their faces

[Chorus: Kelvyn Colt]
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind, yeah

I think of it as saying she's straight
Niggas double tap on the pic
Don't mean it's all love and they all still hate
We all know niggas still fake
Congratulate but wanting my place
Challenge my spot, can't fathom my faith
I'm under God, see, I ain't what's great
Pulling with God, she out in L.A
My father was an immigrant, he had a dream
That was all getting paid just the way Louie V
Now staying by the sea, I get paid by the mil
What you get for your record deal?
Just killed the game, I send you there for deal
Kids go home, everything on my traits is real
I can teach you lane to try for meals
Bruce Wayne, switching lanes, Batmobile (Huh)

[Chorus: Kelvyn Colt]
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind
I know
You don't want me, inside a Benz truck
'Cause you can't get your bands up, ah-ah-ah
You think about it every night, I'm on your mind, yeah1Embed
