​dumb&broken (acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel like I was lost in a space and time
Always tricking others into thinking I am fine
Gotta learn something new, gotta dare to dream
But all I see is that I got no one to lean on
I don't know who I am, what I will be like
And even what I can now
Uh, damn
Am I one? I think that I'm not only
There are lots of people of my age who are always feeling lonely
[Pre-Chorus]
We need support, someone to complain
Somebody who'll tell us everything is okay
But parents are busy to notice our tears
All they say is we are generation of dumb and broken kids

[Chorus]
Wе are tired of you pretеnding we are minor
We are minor, we are, we are minor
People hear us out 'cause we are suicidal
Suicidal, so people hear us out

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh
So people hear us out
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Everytime when I wake up I think of a burning school
Low-key dream of getting hit by car, thinkin' that'd be cool
Speak to classmates, pretend I'm pleased to see them
But why don't you see I want you to f*ck off me

[Pre-Chorus]
Teachers don't really care about us
Don't see our hands are covered in scars
We've never been so close to stars
But all they say is mental issues is not about their class
You might also like[Chorus]
We are tired of you pretending we are minor
We are minor, we are, we are minor
People hear us out, we're suicidal
Suicidal, so people hear us out

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
So people hear us out
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
We are suicidal kids

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm insecure, my mind is my fortress
I'm always feeling good and you don't need to know rest
Am I worth anything in this universe
Or is it better if last thing I see would be the rooftop?
You'll never know what I feel inside
But still you're blaming me for being psychotic child

[Chorus]
People gotta stop pretending we are minor
We are minor, we are, we are minor
People hear us out, we're suicidal
Suicidal, so people hear us out
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh
So people hear us out
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, oh
We are suicidal kids

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
We are su-Embed
