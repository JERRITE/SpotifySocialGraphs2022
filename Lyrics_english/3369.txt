The Best Part of Life (Imanbek Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
All nights, all nights, at night
You only love me when the world's watchin'
All nights, all night, at night, all night
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
Who scared?
Who really afraid of where this goes?
Even though I know how it ends up, ain't nobody scared
I put my hand up in the air
You put your heart up in the air
You gave it to me, made it very clear
This is the ride of your life, I'm excited
I'm happy that it's private, I'm ready, babe
Don't gotta tell me how you like it, I'm psychic
I know just how you like it in every way
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me, nobody else survived, nobody made it out
I gotta wave the flag on the steps by my lonely
I don't know no the miles, girl, I don't know the routes
The only thing I know is this love

[Chorus]
The best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever even if it end
And the best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever, then we re-begin
And the best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever ever 'til the end
And the best part of life
In the movie with you for forever-ever 'til the end

[Verse 2]
Look, truthfully speakin' my dawg, I wouldn't tell you no lies
I wasn't here every night, I did my share of the crimes
I was a terror some times, ain't see the mirror some times
Now I'm accountable, dawg, comfortable closin' my eyes
I can't be 'fraid of the dark, can't let you play with my heart
I was just playin' my part, I'm no use stayin' apart
We been in love for a while, we been in love, no denial
We done ran a forest mile, baby, in the middle of theâ€”

Hold me, nobody else survived, nobody made it out
I gotta wave the flag on the steps by my lonely
I don't know no the miles, girl, I don't know the routes
The only thing I know is this love

[Chorus]
The best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever even if it end
And the best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever, then we re-begin
And the best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever ever 'til the end
And the best part of life
In a movie with you for forever 'til the end
And the best part of life
I'm with you for forever-ever ever 'til the end
And the best part of life
In a movie with you for forever 'til the end

[Outro]
No, no
All nights, all nights, at night
You only love me when they're not watchin'
All nights, all night, every night, all nightEmbed
