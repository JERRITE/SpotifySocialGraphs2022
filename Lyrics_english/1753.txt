[Chorus]
I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip on your waist, bust up the place
Tantalizing
You from the Islands, you stay wildin'
I guide I guide you, like a pilot
[Verse 1]
You want Forest, you bring fire
Anything anything, you desire
You're important, so I require
Your touch and such, I admire
When you're in range I'm near
Keep close, no one interfere
You should know I don't play fair
I'm not gonna let them tear us up

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Uh-woah uh-woah uh-woah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Uh-woah uh-woah uh-woah

[Chorus]
I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip on your waist, bust up the place
Tantalizing
You from the Islands, you stay wildin'
I guide I guide you, like a pilot
You might also like[Verse 2]
You need guidance, a little compliance
We dance Caribana, minus the violence
Girl I'm gully, like Alliance
I drive you Steer, I'ma put on mileage
Haven't been around this year
I'd like to see you change the gears
To a motion that's much faster babe
Grippin' like I'm tryna catch up

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Uh-woah uh-woah uh-woah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I roll up behind it, I wanna try it
Grip on your waist, bust up the place
Tantalizing
You from the Islands, you stay wildin'
I guide I guide you, like a pilot
[Verse 3: Femi Lawson]
First up, we start by touching her hair
Grabbing her waist and it's ok, no fear
She come tantalize me, she grabbing my beard
But she ginger my body, Iâ€™m not talking beer
Come here to daddy, your baba is here
I be like diamond, I smash chandelier
Shine like the sun you sh-sh-sh-sh
Shine like the sun you sh-sh-sh


[Pre-Chorus/Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh, oh4Embed
