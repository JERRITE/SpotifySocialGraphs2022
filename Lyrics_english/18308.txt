[Verse 2: Abra Cadabra]
Totts still pop arff, road get lock arff
Fuck a man's past dirt, Dog, man ah shotta
They ain't on what I'm on, they ain't got what we got, they ain't see what I got in my locker
Beat-beatin' off the .40 'til the whole dance bruck up (Grrah)
Birthday girl, talkin' shit, tell her, "Shut up" (Shut up)
How you got opps in your dance? (How?) Lucky I don't box her to France (Yeah)
When we pull up, pull up, when we hop out, hop out, we ain't wavin' a .9 in the sky
We just, hold a steady aim, take a deep breath, poom-poom, take a man's life (Poom-poom-poom)
Shwe ni impabwa, them man there broke (Them man there broke)
Baby girl, you ain't no joke, come roll with me (Come roll with me)
You can jump in the ride, drive to the other side, hit him with the beam, watch a nigga fall
