Kids in America Lyrics[Verse 1: KJ Apa]
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

[Chorus: KJ Apa & Camila Mendes]
Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round
[Verse 2: Camila Mendes & KJ Apa]
Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying never mind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

[Chorus 2: KJ Apa & Camila Mendes]
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

[Post-Chorus: KJ Apa & Camila Mendes]
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

[Verse 3: KJ Apa & Camila Mendes]
Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America
Everybody lives for the music-go-round

[Post-Chorus: KJ Apa & Camila Mendes]
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la laEmbed
