Anger Rising Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alabama trailer park they call home
Boy standing at attention in the corner his own
Terrified, scorpion crawling the wall
By the way father, could you please beat me some more?

[Chorus]
Anger rising up inside him yet again
Tell me you got a plan
Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
You want to hold my hand
[Verse 2]
Cold Alaska, hiding, bundled up tight
Stretch aluminum foil 'cross the window at night
Mother crying, calling out up the stairs
By the way father, do you even care that I'm scared?

[Chorus]
Devil rising up inside him yet again
Tell me you got a plan
Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
You want to hold my hand

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Generation three, solitary, alone
By the way father, created hell on my own

[Chorus]
Anger rising up inside him yet again
Tell me you got a plan
Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
You want to hold my hand

Anger rising up inside him yet again
Tell me you got a plan
Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and
You want to hold my handYou might also likeEmbed
