Growing Up Gangsta Lyrics[Intro]
Great John on the beat, by the way
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Fross (Hahahaha)
Lemme hear that
Free Dev B, bitch
Look

[Verse 1]
I saw my felons need some Activis, like free the shottas (Grrah)
And only real niggas in my circle, no imposter (Gang)
And brodie, he a demon, he'll turn you into pasta
And after we done smokin' you, we go and eat some lobster (What, what?)
Smokin' big Runtz, shit shootin', call it Falcon (Uh)
If niggas say it's lit, when we see 'em, we gon' out 'em (Grrah-grrah)
He talkin' all that shit, let's really see if he about it (Grrah)
You say you movin' hot, well we turnin' up the climate (Grrah)
Sellin' grams in school while you was learnin' up in class (Gang)
I was addin' bread while you was addin' up in math (Ha)
You was cuffing girls while I was clappin' up that ass (Ass)
You was doing homework while I was working in the trap (Trap)
You was up early taking field trips to school (School)
I was up early in the field, tryna boom (Bwah)
You was tricking with hoes, I scooped her like a spoon
Niggas nutted in her mouth, yeah I know you wifed it too
Ha, we got guns, we got big Tecs (What?)
Talkin' out of line, have them kill you for that big check (Gang, gang, gang)
And we ain't postin' on no book, nigga (At all)
We'll come up on your sides and post up where you be at (Grrah-grrah)
Niggas talkin', you could get flexed (Pussy)
A nigga been holdin' weight like I work in Planet Fitness (Bah)
And please stop talkin' like you droppin' niggas (Gang)
The only droppin' that you doing is from these bullets makin' contact, bang (Grrah-grrah, grrah-grrah-grrah-grrah)
Niggas know my body, I be wildin' out (What?)
'Cause I be movin' like a demon, talkin' spazzin' out
Big booty bitches in the circle, they be actin' out (Grrah)
Ass fat, UFC, have her tappin' out (Rah-rah)
Love the freaky bitches that be actin' on some kinky shit (Woah)
'Cause I be fuckin' all night, she can't believe this shit
Drop top, 'cause I'ma drop the bag if she toppin' it (Skrrt)
I'm startin' to think this bitch a shooter the way she cockin' it (Ha)
[Bridge]
Huh, what?
Huh, what?
Huh, what?
Look

[Verse 2]
Might think I'm James Bond the way I'm fancy with my feets
I heard that she a freak, yeah baby we could meet
Got different color bitties and they all do tricks for me
You was workin' for the city while the city work for me (Ha, pussy)
While you was servin' that food, I was servin' fiends
You was wifin' up them thotties, I was wifin' up that breesh
You was leanin' on them hoes, I was sippin' on that lean
You was trickin' for that pussy, I was fuckin' hoes for free
We ain't fuckin' with Suburbans, this a Cadillac, uh
You was workin' for that breesh, I was takin' that, uh
Told her get up on her knees, you was lickin' cat, uh
You was out here makin' scenes, I was shootin' back, uh
You was in it, finna snitch, I was lockin' in, uh
You was waitin' for that swing, I was poppin' it, uh
I was out here uppin' scores, you was coppin' it, uh
I'm startin' to think this bitch a shooter the way she cockin' it, cockin' it, cockin' it, ahYou might also likeEmbed
