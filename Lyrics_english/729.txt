Sad lyrics ["sad" letter]

[Enter: Bryant Myers]
You come to my thoughts when I'm smoking (Yeh)
So many memories that I have of you (woh), around in my mind
I can't erase them (no!), I just have to endure them

[Pre-car: Bad Bunny]
Sad, mommy, I feel sad
I bite me whenever I think you fuck with another
There is no remedy to fix N forotro ', it's already broken
[Chorus: Bryant Myers & Bad Bunny]
Maybe I don't think about you, but I don't forget (wow)
Maybe I miss you, but I don't say it (no)
Maybe I didn't fulfill anything I swore (ey)
Maybe your wounds never cured them
Maybe I don't think about you, but I don't forget
Maybe I miss you, but I don't say it
Maybe I didn't fulfill anything I swore
Maybe your wounds never cured them

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
I promised you a million thing '
I promised to make you my wife
Now you only have spine '
Because I fuck the petals of the rose
I know that I lied to you, I know that I cheated you
That for me, in love you already lost faith
I damaged the mornings, your kiss 'and the cups' and coffee
Los Bellaqueo 'In the cinema, go to the Park Park'
I swear that my soul split that because of me this is over
Walking only for San Juan, counting to 'the cobblestones
Thinking about the last time with you I came

[Bridge 1: Bad Bunny]
I spend only when I fall in prepre '
Thinking about 'the dust' we throw in the m3
I can't concentrate, the semester was fucking
For me the devil comes now and kidnap me
I spend only when I fall in prepre '
Thinking about 'the dust' we throw in the m3
I can't concentrate, the semester was fucking
For me the devil comes now and kidnap me

[Verse 2: Bryant Myers]
I appear
I say I'm fine, but really (Yeh)
I know you remember too
When we beautiful in the back of the seat (OH)
With you I want to recover (Yeah)
In truth that losing you helped me as a schedule (Wuh)
Baby, I want to see you even a moment

[Bridge 2: Bryant Myers]
I-I have a mushroom enroll '
Without you my soul is Desolá '
I swear I loved you from Verdá '
Now my heart is in the dark '
Oblivion is a place that I have not yet found
They tell me that I can get rid of your love (no)
I would not have failed if I had imagined (Yeh)
That having lost you would cause me so much pain (uoh)
