Even if Lyricsvoy dies for you, I'm going by boat
Jump through the puddles when you want you
I go black, I'm going white
And I have red hair at your health

I put the cabinets upside down to find the rags that
If I'm lucky they will corner you at once
You want or not

Never pass from me
That I give your face even if it dies for you
If you go from me now
They will look with spoon whatever it is about you
Never pass from me
That inflamed myself and then everything can happen
Never pass from me
That scratches you, I know, even if I die for you
Letters you tell me
That nobody interested you but me
One billion promises
But there is no way to have your love

Today is my lucky day, I will uproar half a city
They will invite me to dance your friends, and I know
That you will rage

Never pass from me
That I give your face even if it dies for you
If you go from me now
They will look with spoon whatever it is about you
Never pass like that
That inflamed myself and then everything can happen
Never pass from me
What are you going to lose me, even if I die for you
