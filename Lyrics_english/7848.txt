REAL RECOGNIZE REAL Lyrics[Intro]
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Real niggas recognize real niggas
On a different time, that's why I never feel niggas
Get high every day and slide through every phase
Trials every day, so they sip Wockesha every day
Never could feel my dog through a call, I wish he came home
But you'll never get it back
I know 'bout givin' up loyalty and you'll never get it back
And I know these bitches' intentions, so I never get attached
I just wanna stack it tall to get the freedom for all my niggas
Tell them niggas in the wall to give releases to all my niggas, yeah, yeah
[Verse: Doe Boy]
I don't fuck with niggas, I can't help, I'm antisocial (Antisocial)
I just get to shootin', I don't talk, I'm anti-vocal (Anti-vocal)
Opps prayin' I post 'em, niggas say it's smoke but no, it ain't (Pussy-ass niggas)
Not with the gang, his broke ass really must got some smoke with the bank (Oh, really?)
Just left the bank, I'm headed to his block, catch him, he gettin' chased
Bare faced, Percocets gon' make me throw it all away
Fuck this rap shit, for my nigga case, I'll blow it all today
Brodie know I'm just a JPay message or a call away (True story)
Make that bitch shoot like a chop, I put the switch up on my heater (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Up the score on all my opps, I pull up, hit him, buzzer-beater (Swish)
Fuck that bitch like I'ma keep her, knowin' damn well I'ma leave her
Boy, that drank you're sippin' cut, that ain't Wockesha, bye Felicia (Oh, really?)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Real niggas recognize real niggas
On a different time, that's why I never feel niggas
Get high every day and slide through every phase
Trials every day, so they sip Wockesha every day
Never could feel my dog through a call, I wish he came home
But you'll never get it back
I know 'bout givin' up loyalty and you'll never get it back
And I know these bitches' intentions, so I never get attached
I just wanna stack it tall to get the freedom for all my niggas
Tell them niggas in the wall to give releases to all my niggas, yeah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
