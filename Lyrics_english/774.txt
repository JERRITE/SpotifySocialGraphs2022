Trépeate Lyrics ["Trépe" letter]]

[Intro]
(Trépeate)
D-Note is on the beat
IT's The Beatllione
(Trépeate, clipate, click)

There are many secrets that you and I have
Most of the time hidden we see you
I just want to be your friend, it's not for anything serious
I want to give you hard and take you to the extreme
[Chorus]
Trépeate, until I take it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces

Trépeate, until I take it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces

[Verse 1]
And vamo 'do it Baby pa' that is repeated again and again
You look for me because he does not give you how e '
How rich she drinks, kiss your skin, make crazy 'woman
I give you more in the bathtub, to make your body shiver again

[Bridge]
She releases when smoke boot
He kisses me around his neck as
Quiet baby, as I have none
Give you at night and on breakfast day

[Chorus]
Trépeate, until I take it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces
You Might Also Liketrépate, who until I get it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces

[Verse 2]
I throw the cell, she is not my wife
That's why whenever I call her, she has to hide
It is sweet as honey, today I want to see it
That is why I fall to his apparent, to tattoo on his skin

He told me he was at home
That I break it is molasses
And I crazy to meet the husband
To see what happens
Always hury fat
He tells me that he doesn't get married
And what gets me for the room
If the husband is on the terrace

[Bridge]
She releases when smoke boot
He kisses me around his neck as
Quiet baby, as I have none
Give you at night and on breakfast day
[Chorus]
Trépeate, until I take it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces

Trépeate, until I take it out I will not release you
I give you how it is, Yeh
Rich and slowly
I swear that if I fuck you, I put to live in parcerita in palaces
