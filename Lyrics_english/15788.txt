That man lyric
That man who did you there
That seems so gallant
So attentive and arrogant
I know him like me
That man who did you there
Which appears to be divine
So kind and effusive
He just knows how to suffer
Is a great fool
A stupid conceited
Selfish and capricious
A vain clown
Unconscious and presumed
False bad bad
Has no heart
Full of jealousy
Without reasons or motives
Like the impetuous wind
Few affectionate
Insecure of yourself
Unbearable as a friend
Insufferable as love
That man you see there
That seems so kind
Navigoso and pleasant
I know him like me
That man who had there
That seems so sure
Of stepping well for the world
He just knows how to suffer
He just knows how to suffer
You have no heart
You fooled me with betrayal
You have no heart
That man who did you there
It seems so kind
But it's not pleasant
You fooled me with betrayal
You have no heart
Few affectionate
In a vandious clown
That fills me with pain
You have no heart
You cheated on me
And you betrayed me
I do not love you anymore
False bad grudge
I do not want you anymore
You cheated on me
You cheated on me
And you betrayed me
And you betrayed me
No no no no...
I don't want to make more
No no no ...
You cheated on me
And you betrayed me
Ah Ah I don't love you anymore
I'm not going to suffer anymore
