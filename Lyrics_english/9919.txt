Walked In Lyrics[Intro: Bankroll Fresh]
Street
Yeah, I'm back
(2-17 on the track, man)
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
Know my frames, they’re killin'
All these hoes I'm killin'
Nigga came from dope-dealing
Dirt bike, four-wheeling (Woo)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling (Skrr)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling
[Verse 1: Street Money Boochie]
And I might just lose the ceiling
And I'm trying to grind up on a million
And I might kill it if feel it
Hell yeah
Yeah, damn right I kill it if she give it
MAC got extension
Take it and we flip it
Take it and remix it
Bring it back, Sixteen Curry on them hoes
Bank too big, need pockets like Girbaud
Hold up, wait, know exactly how it goes
It's Boochie

[Verse 2: Strap]
No, bet you can't do it like this
Fully-loaded diamond on both of my wrists
Me and Joblow gon' scheme on your bitch
Alley to my nigga, getting money out the six
Street Money Nino got a hundred in the six
Ain't no gas I'ma juug this mid
Pint coming in, I'ma lean like this
I hit hard like, "Shawty, you lit"
Fuck all you rappers, my trap look like Casper
Came in like this turning up on you bastards
After I smash lil nigga can have her
Fuck from the front then I'm turning her backwards
Ask all those strippers, I stay with that cash
I'm in a dipper, I'm moving them bags
Play with that money we put on a mask
Knew no limit, we bustin' your ass

[Verse 3: Bankroll Fresh]
I walked in throwing to the ceiling
Looking like a motherfucking milli'
Looking like a motherfucking Gotti
Stop flexing, bitch, you ain't really poppin'
These bottle wars, all these bottles what we poppin'
Ace of Spades poppin'
Rosé poppin'
Bitch, we poppin'
You ain’t really jockin'
Y'all niggas flexing
Y'all ain’t got it
I got two bitches, they're gettin' wild
These bitches want to do doggystyle
I got one Black and I got one Chinese
She be talking to me, she say, "Kung pow"
I fucked it up, I just made a pound
Smokin' this shit up, I made a cloud
Just fucked it up at the after hour
4:42, yeah, it can't wait to growl
Bitch, your ass ugly and your ass is musty
So free, bitch, here go a bar of Dial
Stinking-ass breath smell like Black & Mild
I'm fresh as hell, bitch, wipe me down
[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
Know my frames, they're killin'
All these hoes I'm killin'
Nigga came from dope-dealing
Dirt bike, four-wheeling (Woo)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling (Skrr)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling

[Verse 4: Ali]
All of these hoes be staring
All of my shit exclusive
She wants me because I'm cooler
Looking like a goddamn jeweler
Might fly to Bermuda
Thank God, a nigga rich, hallelujah
I flew her out, and I barely even knew her
I fucked her, now that bitch Luda

[Verse 5: Quez]
Walked in this bih looking like Frank Lucas
Me and my goddamn shooters
Carbon got a goddamn cooler
Clip like a goddamn ruler
These bitches faded be acting funny
All that she wants is a bag of money
Get her on molly, she be actin' slutty
Hit from the back and she ate her buddy

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
Know my friends, they're killin'
All these hoes I'm killin'
Nigga came from dope-dealing
Dirt bike, four-wheeling (Woo)
Come up in the street I'm peeling (Skrr)
Come up in the street I'm peeling21Embed
