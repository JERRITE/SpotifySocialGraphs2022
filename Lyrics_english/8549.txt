Power Over Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna be king in your story
I wanna know who you are
I want your heart to beat for me
Oh, I
Want you to sing to me softly
'Cause then I'm outrunning the dark
That's all that love ever taught me
Oh, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Call and I'll rush out
All out of breath now
[Chorus]
You've got that power over me, my my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You've got that power over me, my my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me

[Verse 2]
Remember the lake in the moonlight?
Remember you shivered and shone?
I'll never forget what you looked like on that night
But I know that time's gonna take me
I know that day's gonna come
I just want the devil to hate me
Oh, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Call and I'll rush out
All out of breath now

[Chorus]
You've got that power over me, my my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You've got that power over me, my my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
It was all in doubt, they were all around

[Bridge]
So we hide away and never tell
You decide if darkness knows you well
That lesson of love, all that it was
I need you to see

[Chorus]
You've got that power over me, my my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You've got that power over me, my my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
You've got that power over me
(Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
I know that I let her down, no
Let her down, no

[Chorus]
You've got that power over me, my my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
Got that power over me, my my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
You've got that power over me14Embed
