Fast Slow Disco Lyrics[Verse 1]
I sway in place to a slow disco
And a glass for the saints and a bow for the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?

[Chorus]
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
[Verse 2]
There is blood in my ears and a fool in the mirror
And the bay of mistakes couldn't get any clearer

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?

[Chorus]
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost

[Outro]
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?
Don't it beat a slow dance to death?You might also like4Embed
