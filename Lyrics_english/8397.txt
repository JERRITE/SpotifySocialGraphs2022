Lyrics gasoline ["gasoline"]

[Intro]
Who's This?
Da-Ddy Yan-Kee!

[Pre-car]
Zúmbale mambo pa 'that my cats turn on the motor'
Zúmbale mambo pa 'that my cats turn on the motor'
Zúmbale mambo pa 'that my cats turn on the motor'
That they prepare that what is coming is to give it
Lasted! Mamita, I know that you are not going 'to take me out
Lasted! What I like is that you let yourself take
Lasted! All weekend'es she goes to hesitate
Lasted! My cat does not for 'e janguear, because
[Choir: Daddy Yankee & Glory]
She likes gasoline (give me more gasoline)
How gasoline loves (give me more gasoline)
She likes gasoline (give me more gasoline)
How gasoline loves (give me more gasoline)

[Verse 1]
She turns on the turbines, does not discriminate
Not a marquee party is lost
It is reached up to the corner
Looks so good that even the shadow combines
Killer, dominates me
Janguea in cars, motor and limousines
Fill your adrenaline tank
When you listen to reggaeton in the speakers
[Choir: Daddy Yankee & Glory]
She likes gasoline (give me more gasoline)
How gasoline loves (give me more gasoline)
She likes gasoline (give me more gasoline)
How gasoline loves (give me more gasoline)

[Verse 2]
Here we are the best, I will not adjust to me '
On the track they call us "Los Matadore '"
You make anyone in love
When you dance to the rhythm of the drum '
This is going to the To's Colore 'cats
Pa 'the greatest', pa 'la the minor'
For those that are more foxes than the hunter '
For women who do not turn off their motor '

Have 'you and me something pending
You owe me something and knows it '
With me she gets lost
Does not yield to anyone
Have 'you and me something pending
You owe me something and knows it '
With me she gets lost
Does not yield to anyone
