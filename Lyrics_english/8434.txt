The rain and the sun Lyrics [lyrics of "the rain and the sun" ft. Ebony]

[Chorus: damn]
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away (Yeah)
[Verse 1: damn]
When I die I want to go to hell
I am a piece of shit, it is not very difficult to see it
I criticize your lies, were I sincere?
I take out the colors, I keep an internal gray
I have stolen looks like a photo flash
I have conquered you exactly what the other does
Even more believed, selling smoke, the lies
Talking about changing the world and I don't move a finger
I disgust myself, a coward by nature, there is an attempt
If your guard angel pray, dead cherub
Putting Beats from Manu at four in the morning
The neighbor's crazy will end this suffering, Ah!
Burned metal entering my brain
I will tell Jimmy Hendrix to come to look for the dog
I cling to your smile as the last effort
The bullet explodes the hippocampus and there are no more memories, ah

[Chorus: damn]
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away

Never Seen Before in Your Whole Life
Black Holes in the Soul, Fire in the Eyes
Making Sub Noise when you just fall
All for the Pad Thai, now there is no
Caes of a fifties', but everything goes guay
Everything goes upside down as in Drop The Pharcyde
That's why you won't see me the face never Mais
Rapping 'for the family, all about the life
My memories say goodbye if they don't say bye-bee
The crows surround me, flash in stand-by
If you knew what I keep in there
I squeeze the executioner knot in my nike air laces
Now watch you from above as telescopic views
I see how the mother cries alone
I know the sun will come out, but not now
The rain will make the bullet slip and fall to the tray, Hope

[Chorus: damn]
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun
Won't Wash Away
[Bridge: Dano & Ebano]
Do you see it? This is what I do
I sing, that's my escape, you need a
I'm not a fucking singer, bro
But you are one of the best I've heard
When rhymes is like, it's like music for me
It's magic, you have a gift, brother; You have to share it attempt, bro, seriously, try it once
That everyone knows that you are chosen

[Chorus: DANO DANO & EBANO]
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down
I Know The Sun (Yeah, Thus Primo)
Won't Wash Away (now everyone knows, huh)
And though the rain
Keeps Fallin 'Down (boy)
I Know The Sun (Claro, Bro)
Won't Wash Away (Sure, Bro, EH)
