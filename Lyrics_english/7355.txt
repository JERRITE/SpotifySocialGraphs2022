Big and Chunky Lyrics[Intro]
Chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky

[Hook]
I like them big, I like them chunky
(Chunky)
I like them big, I like them plumpy
(Plumpy)
I like them round, with something, something
(Something)
They like my sound, they think I'm funky
(Funky)
[Verse]
My name is Moto Moto, yeah, you say it double
Say my name girl (Moto Moto)
Say it again (Moto Moto)
I'm nice and smooth, so nice and sassy
(Sassy)
None of the hippo's here, don't wanna get next to me

[Hook]
I like them chunky
Chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky
And plumpy
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky
And plumpy
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy, plumpy

[Verse]
I like them hippos, that's in the wild
(That's in the wild)
I like they attitude, I like they style
(I like they style)
The way they walk, walk, the way they talk, talk
(The way they talk)
I like them with an appetite to eat a shark, shark
And when the dog barks
(Woof, woof)
They eat them too
I love every inch, oh, yes I do (I love you too baby)

Chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky, chunky

[Verse]
Ain't nothing wrong with loving chunky
(Chunky)
I like them funny, I like them spunky
(Spunky)
I like them witty, I like them smart
(With brains)
Girl, I like your big
(What you say?)
Your big ol' heart, what?
Girl, you're crazy, she drive me crazy
(Crazy)
I love my lady, she nice and shapely
(Shapely)
She nice and spacey, take so much space up
Like a big ol' spaceship, yeah so gracious

It's all in the way she move
It's all in the way, it's all in the way
It's all in the way she move
