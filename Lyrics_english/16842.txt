Comforter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where there are no words
And even breathing hurts
You're my comforter
You're my comforter

[Verse 2]
You won't abandon me
You're with me in the deep
And You won't let me sink
And You won't let me sink
[Chorus 1]
This will be my great redemption
While I weep, You'll set my feet to dancing

[Verse 1]
Where there are no words
And even breathing hurts
You're my comforter
You're my comforter

[Verse 2]
You won't abandon me
You're with me in the deep
And You won't let me sink
And You won't let me sink

[Chorus 2]
This will be my great redemption
While I weep, You'll set my feet to dancing
Till You and me are the last ones standing
I learn to lean more than understanding

[Bridge & Outro]
'Cause You are always good
'Cause You are always good
You are always good
You are always good
