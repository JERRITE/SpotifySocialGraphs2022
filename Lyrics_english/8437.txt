[Galician]
Well, town!
Here are the 12 disciples!
There were many calls!
But 12 the chosen!
How can I say that it is worth it to keep living.
Until we reach the last supper!

[Vico C]
Remove your pa 'put me
Let's see here who is who
Then do not say that it was not noticed
They are twelve that give per hundred
Remove your pa 'put me
Let's see here who is who
After not say that it is not noticed
They are twelve that give per hundred
[Eddie Dee]
This is my borinque Day (Aja!)
To those of the torro distributing Leсa
ЙChate pal lao 'which is the turn of my download
There is no na 'pa' ti, nor pa 'your long tongue
What do you know about liriquear and pull with flow
What do you know, you don't know na ', who knows here is me
Buso Buso gives them their intentions
Better that the pants fit well

[Tego Calderon]
12 gathered, and here is To's's craziest
Riddling, killing them
Dirty difficult with your combo I throw me
Speaking of monkey, the guy sings with King Kong
Look at it border on the most locario
The neighborhood 'coge
Styles copying, the most shell
A chota with papers talking about masks

[Volt]
That they are raying, this is wild
I do not turn off the turro or voltage
They leave on a trip, what is coming is sabotage
I'm going to be waiting for you when I get out of my area
I strongly put the mami shake
I'm going to see how they border, pown, and sweat
Mierants of Cemn, I have opinion there is no doubt
I hope that no Judas comes out of the 12

[Daddy Yankee]
(What what what!)
Daddy Yankee injected the lethal morphine
That makes them bleed by the wound
Play the letters that the brisca I have
Let's go to million, melting the bombillon
Of alley
I stand firm in the sono
Defeating the key, rumba with my sandungueo
Every time I put this planted my attitude
Remove you, that in this I am more than you

[Ivy Queen]
Remove you who arrived the horse
The bitch, the diva, the Potra
The mommy that has the tomb '
To the one stop in front, I take it to me '
Chilling, because the Queen has the mambo and
Chilling, whenever I kill
If in Puerto Rico they already know it
The queen of this arrives so throw yourself
[Johnny Prez]
Blessed to hear this liriqueo
Remove you if you don't give the size, what there is is fire (pa 'after!)
After not say that it is not noticed (pa 'after!)
Here the cod was distributed
I have Celia's sugar, and Tito Puente's rumba
I compose as Tito, and I give sticks like Clemente
I don't sing Cora 'Sing with El Cora'
It was worth so much delay

I saw the same as clear as the dark
And I swear that without batteries I am the most than hard
All on track one by one
They are many knuckles, I'm a single knot
Look for all the necessary pliers
They have a language and I have several
My flow feels where I spend
With a microphone, and 12 brothers on the same arm

[Lennox]
Here the Lennox arrived with his seasoning
Us to the other concern
Doing good music is my obligation
A little sauce with reggaeton
Now I come without stipulation
Loading this chapter
And no other title is needed
We are the 12 disciples

[Galician]
Look, my brother!
Let's celebrate, this people keep dancing, sweating!
Existing as a town inside an album, or in a residential!
And what never rains or thunder, we are huйrfanos of consciousness!
Today we are 12! Tomorrow ... we will be thousands!
