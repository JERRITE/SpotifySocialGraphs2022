With Love From Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm hiding out in Missouri
Not happy anywhere
I had it all in front of me
I didn't even care
It's kinda like a mystery
I'd even end up here
I packed up all I could carry
On a one-way fare

[Chorus]
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
[Verse 2]
I'm layin' low in Las Vegas
With nothin' else to do
But dream of ditchin' all my things
And comin' back for you

[Chorus]
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
I'm just wondering
I'm just wondering
Ah

[Bridge]
Looking for clovers, over and over
All that I want is some kind of closure
I saw a house that looked like ours did
I'm kinda homesick, wish that I wasn't
Looking for answers, hopin' to find me
Flirt with the moment, just to ignore it
I'm getting nervous, thinking about it
Why must we always live in a panic?
I've got a feeling, baby, surprise me
I'm getting older, over and over
I'm getting used to wakin' up slower
I still remember your head on my shoulder
You might also like[Chorus]
I told you that I'd change (Ah)
But I guess I never did (Ah)
I told you that I'd change (Ah)
But I guess I never did (Ah)
I'm just wondering (I told you that I'd change)
I'm just wondering (But I guess I never did)

[Outro]
I've got a feeling, baby, surprise me
I'm getting older, over and over
I'm getting used to wakin' up slower
I still remember your head on my shoulder
That's why I wrote you, with love from MissouriEmbed
