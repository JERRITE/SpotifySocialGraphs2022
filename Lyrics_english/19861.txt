Count the Hours Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm waiting through the shallows
Just waiting for a sign
It's dark under the clouds tonight

[PreChorus]
You know I count the hours
I'm waiting every second
Til' you realize, through the lows and highs
I'm the one you had to find
Hey, oooh
Yeah, oooh

Will you realize, i'm the one you had to find?
To find

You know I count

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I used to know just what I needed
Figures in the light
Now I'm struggliing to survive
The collide

[PreChorus]
You know I count the hours
I'm waiting every second
Til' you realize, through the lows and highs
I'm the one you had to find

Hey, oooh
Yeah, oooh

Will you realize, i'm the one you had to find?
To find
You might also likeYou know I count
