[Chorus 1: Farruko]
I don't trust anyone (Yeh)
If you want to speak badly about me
Nor do I believe in anyone (nobody, nobody)
He doesn't know how much they have turned me ’
I don't want to know anyone (nobody, nobody)
If none has given me anything to me
Tell me what they have done for me, nobody (the witch)
Have passed ’for what I have passed’
That's why I'm so and if I don't give me

[Verse 1: Alexio the beast]
I don't believe in Ada's stories
Love is signed sentence
The spoken promises
Dry looks, my back being stuffed

The street, good and bad
The cuts, the bullets, the sticks
The little ones wanting to be great
To ’the world pulls pa’ its side

Even if I love you, baby
I have fallen in a long time
Of a whore that climbing to heaven
He released me and broke my feet
I no longer trust hearts
Every new million that crowns
I get closer to betrayals

[Refrain 2: Alexio the beast]
I don't trust anyone (huh)
Knowing that enemies and federals are looking for me
Nobody (Yeh)
If even what they walk have already turned to me '
You Might Also Likeno confio anyone (nobody, nobody)
Now ask yourself if you lived the same as me
Nobody (Yeh)
That those who confused one by one failed you

[Verse 2: Farruko]
(Farru!)
Damn is the man who trusts another man (Yeah)
I did it, I failed and an AK bullet made my name big
Anyone puts a price on your head
By pair of pesos, so it is worth a piece
"Don't trust yourself" my mother always told me
The devil is a pig and disguises himself as an angel
Take care of what you have 'around

I trust nobody, I am abhorrent '
I'm always playing alive
Whores are seized, panas turn
I don't believe in mine
(On the phone I do not speak to Jodias)
They record you, they iron you, look for you and take you the next day

[Chorus 1: Farruko]
I don't trust anyone (Yeh)
If you want to speak badly about me
Nor do I believe in anyone (nobody, nobody)
He doesn't know how much they have turned me ’
I don't want to know anyone (nobody, nobody)
If none has given me anything to me
Tell me what they have done for me, nobody (nobody, nobody)
Have passed ’for what I have passed’
That's why I'm so and if I don't give me

[Verse 3: Alexio the beast, Farruko]
This 'Cabrone' doesn't know what it is to fuck
They put pressure on you and sing in front of the judge
No one is loyal, there are many chota 'street'
They talk to you and kill you with your mouth

This 'Cabrone' doesn't know how to fuck
They put pressure and sing to the judge
They are not loyal, they are to ’some chota '
That kill you with your mouth

[Chorus 2: Alexio the Beast, Farruko]
I don't trust anyone (huh)
Knowing that enemies and federals are looking for me
Nobody (Yeh)
If even what they walk have already turned to me '

I don't trust anyone (nobody, nobody)
Now ask yourself yourself
If you live the same as me
Nobody (Yeh)
That those who confused one by one failed you
