Black Swan Song LyricsWhen pressure won’t leave my troubled mind
I turn around, dig down
Get my trash out, by dawn
I got no bending rule tricks
No breaking brew from the tower-dud
No gambling roadmap to rule our world

Some folks around
Have a brush with the blues

When life sucks
Every moment counts for real
Let the world
Sing along
On an everlasting song

We got cookies
To carve our way
A fortune-path from craddle to grave

How do you spell
The sound from the bell?
Don’t make me wait all night
‘cause we can move the tide
So let’s move the tide

When life sucks
Every moment counts for real
We got cookies
To carve our way

Let the world
Sing along
On a black swan songYou might also likeEmbed
