Stuck in Traffic Lyrics[Intro]
Two-way, duece, siete
It's ConCreatures, 227, where we at with it?
Hell Block, hully-gully, mafia, what else?
Uh-uh, uh

[Verse 1]
227, Concrete, we get them bricks gone
On 4th and Long, we still get 'em in the end zone
Last month I threw away like ten flip phones
I been shot at, I been set up, I been backstabbed and snitched on
Real leery of these niggas, all I hear is Siri
Giving me directions through the town way down in Missouri
I know, the bureau know, we the reason for your mural
Investigating me for bodies and I'm talkin' plural
Duckin' New York undercovers and now Miami Vice
My lil' niggas out here thuggin', bustin' heads for stripes
Insane in the membrane, they out they fucking rabid
Cut from a whole different cloth, whole 'nother fabric
Sig Sauer switch gang, them boys with the static
Written in blood permanent ink, I had to get it tatted
Pull up, let off a movie clip, leave yo' block cinematic
That drank like two-fifty a line, got some expensive habits
Let's get it
[Chorus]
Tell whoever lookin' for me I'm somewhere stuck in traffic
Start levelin' up in the streets soon as I cut the baggage
They tryna cut corners and cheat but ain't no buddy passes
But they remember me back when they wasn't cashin'
'Cause I was havin' shit my way when niggas wasn't havin'

[Verse 2]
Sold dope all my life, that still don't justify what I done sold
Brodie on parole and still that nigga ride with his pole
All that I been through, I never testified, never told
I done robbed, I done killed, I done lied, I done stole
Seen some shit that make you lose yo' lunch, I couldn't hold my stomach
At the crib pacin' back and forth 'cause I know they comin'
Chain smoking back-to-back blunts, I'm a nervous wreck
Strung out on the lean got me addicted to the Percocets
Not too much different from servin' fiends that I'm accustomed to
Comin' through customs getting hassled by the constables
Went off-course, some would say was part of the obstacle
Lil buzzo in the pen, I feel partly responsible
Shoot a trip to make a play for eighty, that's a rendezvous
Ain't tryna trick with you baby, I'm tryna sponsor you
Met at the rendezvous point, my plug fresh out of the joint
Said we gon' drive to the Zehrs and then fly back to Detroit

[Chorus]
Tell whoever lookin' for me I'm somewhere stuck in traffic
Start levelin' up in the streets soon as I cut the baggage
They tryna cut corners and cheat but ain't no buddy passes
But they remember me back when they wasn't cashin'
'Cause I was havin' shit my way when niggas wasn't havin'You might also likeEmbed
