Dirty Game LyricsYou sent me a message said you're sorry
How come I don't feel like you're sincere?
Those excuses sound so useless, baby
This time rewind and I'll make it clear

You're playing a dirty game, dirty game
I know that you don't deserve me
Telling me little white lies, cheating eyes
Baby, I won't let you hurt me
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-oh
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-oh
I think we're done theres no point in screaming
I've told you so many times before
You don't seem to hear me or believe it
Read my lips now and I'll say it once more

You're playing a dirty game, dirty game
I know that you don't deserve me
Telling me little white lies, cheating eyes
Baby I won't let you hurt me
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-oh
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-oh

I've told you so many times before baby
Read my lips now I'll say it once more
Baby, baby, baby

You're playing a dirty game, dirty game
I know that you don't deserve me
Telling me little white lies, cheating eyes
Baby I won't let you hurt me
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-oh
No dirty games, dirty games, oh-oh-ohYou might also likeEmbed
