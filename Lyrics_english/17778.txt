Cah them niggas, they be washed up, uh
She on my dick becah I bust up, uh
I see a nigga at the bus stop
Baby girl I know you see me in this drop top
Like its nice to nice to know you, lets do it again
How we did it on a one night stand
Girl I wanna be more than a friend for you
I trap, I trap, I'm with Mafta and he's whippin' that peng
And that foods comin' ten outta ten
It's why these bitties runnin' back for that leng
On that corner
I can't sleep at night man it fucks with my head
I got niggas that are stuck up in that pen
They're doin' life like when will it end? Uh, uh
Like, like when will it end? Uh
Gettin' Audi cah we spinnin' again
Cah we spinnin' again uh, uh
Gotta visit again uh, uh
I'm in these trenches with demons
You let them nines go
I'm screamin' free all my niggas
Its like the time froze
I was down bad for two summers tryna get my grind on
Tell my dawgs go we gon make it and get our shine on
My brodie tryna eat, get his grind on
He got caught up by police now his time's gone
My niggas runnin' with the streets, free up my dawgs
So I'm tryna make it out before my times gone
I'm reminiscin' while I'm walkin' through these projects
These niggas hatin' and prayin' that I'ma die next
I told my dawgs we gon' finish what we started
I'ma ball hard with all the niggas I starved with, uh, uh
