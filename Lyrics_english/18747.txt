Napalm in the Morning Lyrics[Intro]
"I love the smell of napalm in the morning
It smells like victory"

[Verse 1]
Decease is just an irony of fate
Multiple rites, I'm gonna lose my way
Paraphiliac body control
To slay the phantom from my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna die
[Chorus]
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire's raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring?
Napalm in the morning
Napalm in the morning

[Verse 2]
Skin peeling off to drop your timid mask
You wish that death redeems you fast
Creation of the fire seems the perfect nude
Your carbonized torso just a part of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna die

[Chorus]
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire's raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring?
Napalm in the morning
Napalm in the morning
Napalm in the morning
The napalm in the morning

[Bridge]
Charlie close to me
Smell of gasoline
Physically abused
See the hollow face
That burned down and raped
Your petition refused
Screaming for your life
Suffocation cries
Religion's been lost
Dancing in the flames
That's your destiny
Surrendered to the gods
You might also like[Chorus]
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire's raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring?
Napalm in the morning

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna die

[Chorus]
Unholy evil prophets rise
Fire's raining from the endless skies
Can you hear the final thunder roaring?
Napalm in the morning
Napalm in the morning
Napalm in the morning

[Outro]
Time-bomb warrior
Flanking all around
Fighting back their lies
You're my soul, insane
Blood stops feeding veins
Goddamn monkey's bite
Ashes dung the ground
Infuriate mauled
Recrudescence of wounds
There's no time to waste
Smash 'em without grace
Hell is coming to you
To youEmbed
