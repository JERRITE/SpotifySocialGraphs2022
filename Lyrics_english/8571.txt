Active Duty Lyrics[Intro]
The U.S. is sending at least three-thousand soldiers to the middle-east as The Pentagon prepares for potential reaction from Iran

We made the right decision to take out this terrorist. He caused enormous death and destruction throughout the region. Killed hundreds of Americans over the years, but had done so in the past couple of days

This is bigger than Bin Laden, it's bigger than Baghdad

Everyone is going to lose if this continues

[Verse 1: C-Ray]
Overseas, active-duty, here to serve my
Country and protect the freedom we believe
And know it's a sin but from the birds eye
It's for my kids protection, wonder will I get to see my seed
Again, I turn my kin to a penpal
While I'm ducking in the trenches, hugging IEDs
Mounting this defensive, laying lead down
Freedom in the name of being all that I can be
I ain't saying I agree with what I'm into all the time, but this military's how I feed the fam
And damn I'm losing time and my friends too
Never think I won't get buried, cause indeed I can
On tour, no crowd, just the media
Loose cannons and news cameras negate the facts
And we just hope to make it back, but the fact is you're all distracted by these rappers and some bitches who stay on they backs
Hours wasted away from the big picture
You trynna make it safe in a place where the strays hit ya
But ignoring us is nothing but procedure, when all they give a fuck about's our leader
Damn
[Interlude]
For President Trump, the start of the year will be largely consumed by the impeachment process as Democrats and Republicans try to end their stalemate over the Senate trial to come. In Washington a lot of moving pieces as the impeachment drama plays out there. Democrats are just thirty-two days away from the Iowa Caucuses

Nothing is clear about what a trial would would look like with both sides stuck in a stalemate over the process

[Verse 2: C-Ray]
At the house a nervous wreck and scared to lose my
Husband while he's off to keep our world free
Strong appearance for my daughter but I do cry
Cause any minute I could get the word he's
Been reduced to an image in the picture frame
And that I lost my other half in the conflict
Often I bow my head and begin to pray
For the Lord to keep em safe while the clock tick
My single friends try to talk me in to going out
Like I'm not a married mom with the wedding band
Responsibility is something they don't know about
These hoes'll only be my friend till I'm in a jam
But I got bigger fish to fry like the rent, the car
No crucial
Every dime that gets spent
Food and clothes with the check, I hope it cash again
Don't give a fuck about me keeping up with the Kardashian's

[Interlude]
Be brutally honest with me. Do either of you actually have a mailman charge on America's Got Talent. Per-say if you were to come on, and I was to ask you what is your talent, would you, would you have any?
You might also likeI think being an entrepreneur is definitely a skill, and if you ask me like what my job title is

Yeah, what do you put on your passports?

Umm, it changes. Sometimes I just write really random and say teacher

[Verse 3: C-Ray]
At school distracted, I hope I pass my
Finals, I cannot afford to drop the ball
I'm tripping 'bout my dad cause the last time
I spoke to him it was brief phone, dropped the call
I haven't heard from him since and I'm freaking out
So staying focused on my studies isn't easy
Especially when death is all they speak about
In newspapers, internet and on the TV
And I don't know if I should laugh or be offended
In class with the girl in back of me who's pregnant
Staring at me like I need to step my game up cause I ain't running to the bathroom peeing every thirty seconds
And I know my mom's hurting to the bone
She's lonely and always closes the curtains when she's home
I'm in the zone and close to living on my own now
But all they give a fuck about is genders and their pronouns

[Interlude]
Well law makers haven't gotten around to fixing infrastructure, housing crisis
Almost in its vanishing little class
But they are at the forefront of another fight, re-writing grammar
I think we agree that if you say y'know I'd really like you to call me this
Out of politeness, I will
But they're forcing people to say something stupid
This is a command that requires people to refer to others who have not asked to be called this. By a plural pronoun when it's a singular person. It's grammatically incorrect. It's awkward, it's dumb, it doesn't serve the interest of anybody, and it applies to all of us
*Well see*
But everyone's too afraid to call it what is which is insane
*Well look*
Why don't both of us next time we hear this say " y'know what, no. I'm not playing along with your fantasy like leave me alone please."Embed
