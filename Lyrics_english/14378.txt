Double Yellow Lines Lyrics[Verse 1: Kyle Falconer]
I was taught a lesson
By these cobbled streets that
It's the company you keep not
The people you meet
Chimney smoke you made me look like a joke
Torrential rain, oh no, you made my mind choke
Stop signs oh you're red and white coloured dots in the
Middle made me realise
I'm high as a kite
Do you think I'll be sleeping, on my own tonight?
[Chorus: Kyle Falconer]
Double yellow lines by the side of the road
Yellow lines will ye' carry me home
Yellow lines by the side of the road take me home tonight

[Verse 2: Kyle Falconer]
And there's the fire brigade
The working class parade, I chased you down
The street and with a laugh and a smile you tilted your hat to greet me
There's the old streetlight that taught
Me my minds all right
It's more important than a fist and a fight
Do you think
I should go home to my mother, tonight?

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer]
Double yellow lines by the side of the road
Yellow lines will ye' carry me home
Yellow lines by the side of the road take me home tonight
Double yellow lines by the side of the road
Yellow lines will ye' carry me home
Yellow lines by the side of the road take me home tonight
Double yellow lines by the side of the road
Yellow lines will ye' carry me home
Yellow lines by the side of the road take me home tonightYou might also likeEmbed
