Colorblind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Colorblind
You don't see through my eyes
Shades of red
They blend when we're intertwined

[Pre-Chorus]
The empty hole in my chest
I've been learning to embrace it
The vacancy that you left
Now you're learning to erase it
[Chorus]
I know you'll hear this in the fall
But you won't pick up when I call
You see the hell you've put me through
But all you care about is you
All you care about is you
And I'm still colorblind

[Drop]
And I'm still colorblind
And I'm still colorblind

[Verse 2]
I'm writing songs
That say I'm already numb
The awful truth
Is I am lost when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
The empty hole in my chеst
I've been learning to embracе it
The vacancy that you left
Now you're learning to erase it

[Chorus]
I know you'll hear this in the fall
But you won't pick up when I call
You see the hell you've put me through
But all you care about is you
All you care about is you
And I'm still colorblind
You might also like[Drop]
And I'm still colorblind
And I'm still colorblind

[Outro]
Still colorblind
