Perfectly Broken Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm back at the start, fallin' apart in the old ways
I wish I was flawless, I'm not
Was fading away, but everything fell into place
When you told me your name

[Pre-Chorus]
Two halves of a heart hardly beating alone
But now that I've found you, I'm not letting go

[Chorus]
Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly, you fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me
[Verse 2]
You've been in the dark believing your thoughts
When they tell you you're anything less than you are
But that's just not true
'Cause all of the scars and the bruises
They're what make you human

[Pre-Chorus]
We didn't need fixing all of this time
'Cause all of your edges fit right into mine

[Chorus]
Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly, you fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly, you fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me
For me, you fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me
For me, me
You're perfectly broken forYou might also likeEmbed
