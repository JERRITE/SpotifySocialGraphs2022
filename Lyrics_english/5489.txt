A Glorious Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who could send something so pure to lure me away?
I fought with the last of my breath

[Chorus]
But you came along on a glorious day
By the time that you left, I was crawling again
Yeah, you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again

[Verse 2]
The fire that they said would burn just lights up the way
I lie in the place where I fell
And three years on, this nine day wonder won't go away
Till you bring an end to my hell
[Chorus]
When you came along on a glorious day
By the time that you left, I was crawling again
Yeah, you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again

[Bridge]
Let them all keep their plans, 'cause all I want is in my hands
And I can't look down
Back then I had it all and now I want it back, that's all
And I can't get out

[Chorus]
When you came along, on a glorious day
By the time that you left i was crawling again
Yeah, you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again
Now I want you to save me again
Now I want you to save me againYou might also likeEmbed
