Fred Astaire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, of course I miss you, baby
I've been thinking lately
That you don't need me anymore
You'd better be with Fred Astaire
He could take you anywhere
If you ask him to

[Chorus]
And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he could take you 'round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for you
[Verse 2]
Well, he could buy you a diamond ring
Or he could get you anything
If you ask him to
He probably knows how to dance
And he could fly you to France
And you could do it all night long

[Chorus]
And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he could take you 'round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And God knows
It's a common misconception
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out to breakfast
But he could take you 'round the world
Fred Astaire's the man for youYou might also like14Embed
