You forgot Lyrics ["You forgot"]

[Verse 1: C. Tangana]
I do remember when we met
I was there with a friend's girlfriend
Dark circles on the face and nose spread in Perico, ha
Baby, so I'm still, you tried to show me what I am worth (mm, mmm)
As if I don't love what I do so much (PSS)

[Chorus: C. Tangana, Omar Apollo, both]
I'm going to ask for more drinks (ey)
I'm going to throw the dice (ey)
I'm going to lose my kids
And end the knuckles' marked (wuh)
You forgot who you fell in love (sometimes gives pain)
You forgot who you fell in love (sometimes gives me life)
I'm going to ask for more drinks
I'm going to throw the dice
I'm going to lose my kids
And end the knuckles' marked, baby (wuh)
[Verse 2: C. Tangana]
I live inviting the compas (Yah)
I live without looking at the accounts
Always ready for gresca (Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang)
Always in Farra, always at a party (always the same; ey)
If my life bothers them (I Don's Fuck; Yah)
When leaving the door (Yaoh; ey)
That nobody has invited him (no, no, no, Nah)
I am not interested in what they think
And that all the sons of a bitch die (everything '; hopefully they all kill themselves)
Who are talking behind my back to fall (hopefully they kill everything ')

[Chorus: C. Tangana, Omar Apollo, both]
I'm going to ask for more drinks
I'm going to throw the dice
I'm going to lose my kids
And end the knuckles' marked
You forgot who you fell in love (sometimes gives pain)
You forgot who you fell in love (sometimes gives me life)
I'm going to ask for more drinks
I'm going to throw the dice
I'm going to lose my kids
And end the knuckles' marked, baby

[Verse 3: Omar Apollo]
What a living life, without forgetting you
If you want, baby, talk to me
You left me agitated
However, I walk here (wuh)
Without thinking about you (sometimes it gives pain, sometimes it gives me life)
