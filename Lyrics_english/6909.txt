Serenade lyrics [intro]
I write agony serenades
Under the window where she
The morning comes cold
And spends the afternoon and night
And I don't even know what I did
Before this melody arrived

And what are we separated
We, the inseparable?
Compulsive liars decided
To grab us to such fragile truths
But don't go, not now that you will shelter
And if you are and if the faith bazaar
With you and I don't admit
[Chorus]
You say you want to be my therapy
Listen to this same melody
In your dreams, or are it alone, my dreams

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I thank our distance
If I'm not ready for you
Ready, I WILL GENERAL GREAT
And what my tale tells is simply
I am a child
And it's proven in your Bae lips
Just one more dance
Only one more
Song launches, but songs tire me and the
Legs shake bumps of body and soul
Calm actor
Come out here to see the green see the color of the fauna
Body and soul, actor of calm
Come out here see love I 'tou the color of fauna
Body and soul, actor of calm
Come out here to see the green see the color of the fauna
Body and soul, actor of calm
Come out here see love I 'tou the color of fauna
Body and soul
(Dreams are just your treasures)
Body and soul
(Dreams are just your treasures)
Body and soul
(Dreams are just your treasures)
Body and soul
(Dreams are just your treasures ...) you might also like7embed
