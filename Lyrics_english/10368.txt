Closer Than You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Falling apart when you're so far
You're the only thing that I can't lose
I can't lose
You filled in the cracks didn't know I had
Melting my heart from the broken glass
Now in every part of me it's you

[Chorus]
And I don't want nobody else
Closer than you, closer than you
I can't let in someone else
Closer than you, closer than you, oh woah, oh (Oh woah, oh)
[Post-Chorus]
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)

[Drop]
(Closer than you)

[Verse 2]
Every day as the years go by
You never fall 'cause we're intertwined
I'll be the one who's holding on to you

[Chorus]
And I don't want nobody else
Closer than you, closer than you
I can't let in someone else
Closer than you, closer than you, oh woah, oh (Oh woah, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)
(Closer than you)
You might also like[Drop]
(Closer than you)

[Outro]
I'm falling closer with you
I'm falling closer with youEmbed
