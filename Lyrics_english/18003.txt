After Youâ€™re Gone LyricsThere'll be laughter even after you're gone
I'll find reasons to face that empty dawn
'Cause I've memorized each line in your face
And not even death can ever erase
The story they tell to me

I'll miss you
Oh, how I'll miss you
I'll dream of you
And I'll cry a million tears
But the sorrow will pass
And the one thing that will last
Is the love that you've given to me
There'll be laughter even after you're gone
I'll find reasons and I'll face that empty dawn
'Cause I've memorized each line in your face
And not even death could ever erase
The story they tell to meYou might also likeEmbed
