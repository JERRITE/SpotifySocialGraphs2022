We amor lyrics [text song "Mi Amor"]

[Refrain]
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I dream of white yachts all your life to follow us
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I want chains of gold, about an hour of diamonds
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
He wants to take her everywhere, the most beautiful children to give birth
We amor tells me, "Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello?"
[Stanza 1]
Hey, ring me mobile (brrr, halo?)
My baby wants the new Louis V (UF)
And AMO, you, the baby, 'let's go a little shopping - Milan (' let's go a little)
With a friend in my benz
Around town rides, on Story Kaci my song
Says don't know where they are, crazy about being pulled
Calls to ask if I want to give birth to a kid
E, my saints, vests
You know all the shortcuts to the heart, my sinner
Key X6 and Breast the Fives
And at the hotel door all those stars

[Refrain]
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I dream of white yachts all your life to follow us
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I want chains of gold, about an hour of diamonds
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
He wants to take her everywhere, the most beautiful children to give birth
We amor tells me, "Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello?"

Baby, I'm your slave, I'm your slave
Doing these things, baby, doing non-stop
Very, I'm not my own when I'm not your
So throw all these things now on the floor
I will discover your secret, little as a bark
I want to watch you all the evening on FaceTime
I will discover your secret little, smallest, we amor, we amor

[Refrain]
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I dream of white yachts all your life to follow us
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
Baby, I want chains of gold, about an hour of diamonds
We amor calls me, tells me, "Hello?"
He wants to take her everywhere, the most beautiful children to give birth
We amor tells me, "Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello?" (Halo, halo)
