A Good Song Never Dies Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stop, now let's begin
You're in too deep to go back again
Cash, it's pay-to-play
You want more hits than Lemonade
No, you don't own me, you don't even know me
Who? This vagabond
With a two-part path to the great beyond
How? Stay genuine
A ground floor opp', I can help you find
Oh, you're a dreamer, call me when you're Bieber
[Pre-Chorus]
And when they play it, you can't help but sing along
That's nothin' odd, that's nothin' wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause a good song never dies
It just reminds you of where you were
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never
No, a good song never
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never
Dies

[Verse 2]
Hope, the wonder drug
Don't work no more, think I took too much
Sweat, your equity
Make the caffeine be your weaponry
What is the reason? There never was one needed
Fear, it's all around
But it weighs too much to slow you down
Now is the time to act
'Cause the best defense is a timeless track
No, you don't own me, you don't even know me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But when they play it, you can't help but sing along
That's nothin' odd, that's nothin' wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause a good song never dies
It just reminds you of where you were
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never
No, a good song never
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never

[Bridge]
There was a moment, a hole opened in the sky
A chance to join their pantheon
For all the times they never heard your battle cry
Now even angels sing along

[Chorus]
'Cause a good song never dies
It just reminds you of where you were
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never dies
Like a lover who won't back down
They'll pull you over to the side, looks you straight into the eyes
No, a good song never
No, a good song never
The first time it made you cry, the first time you felt alive
No, a good song never19Embed
