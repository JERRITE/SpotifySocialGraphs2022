German Cars Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm in love with German cars
Gliding past me on the Autobahn
Stainless idols with silent hearts
Never turning, as we drift apart

[Chorus]
Are you a lover or a friend?
It's not easy to pretend
That you won't leave me in the end
It's not easy, the end
[Verse 2]
It is harder to say goodbye
Than spend the future unsanctified
By the kindness of your empty heart
Kill me softly, as we drift apart

[Chorus]
Are you a lover or a friend?
It's not easy to pretend
That you won't leave me in the end
It's not easy, the end

[Spoken by Jen Clarke]
I know that it's been a little sad at times
Oh I know, like a flower in the spring that's never been rained on

[Chorus]
Are you a lover or a friend?
It's not easy to pretend
That you won't leave me in the end
It's not easy, the endYou might also likeEmbed
