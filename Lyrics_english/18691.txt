Armed to the Teeth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stand down and change your course, don't come at me
Push back, looks like an attack, hostility
Well, I'm not the same as anyone you ever knew
Absolutely no idea what I could do to you

[Chorus]
Ballistic, sadistic, beyond belief
Try me, defy me, I'm armed to the teeth

[Verse 2]
Charge on, ignore the warning, a hundred megatons
Prepare annihilation, it's now DEFCON 1
[Chorus]
Ballistic, sadistic, beyond belief
Try me, defy me, I'm armed to the teeth
Ballistic, sadistic, beyond belief
Try me, defy me, I'm armed to the teeth

[Bridge]
Calm before the storm
Death is marching on
Hell shall rain upon you
Your final chance gone

[Verse 3]
Look me in the eyes, you son of a bitch
But like the coward you are, turn and run
Punishment, judgment day, your time has come
Your time has come

[Verse 4]
For once, you've been taught a lesson, now it's all uphill
Man up, admit the damage, stand up and rebuild

[Chorus]
Ballistic, sadistic, beyond belief
Try me, defy me, I'm armed to the teeth
Ballistic, sadistic, beyond belief
Try me, defy me, I'm armed to the teeth

Ballistic (Ballistic)
Sadistic (Sadistic)
Try me (Try me)
Defy me
