All That Iâ€™ve Got Lyrics[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh
[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Outro]
And it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got6Embed
