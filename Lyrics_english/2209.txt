Beside You Lyrics[Verse 1: Calum, Calum & Luke]
Within a minute, I was all packed up
I've got a ticket to another world
I don't want to go, I don't want to go
Silent words are hard to speak
When your thoughts are all I see
"Don't ever leave," she said to me

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Ashton]
When we both fall asleep underneath the same sky
To the beat of our hearts at the same time
So close but so far away
Can you hear me?
[Chorus: All]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you
She lies awake
I'm tryna find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you

[Verse 2: Calum, Calum & Michael]
Another day and I'm somewhere new
I made a promise that I'll come home soon
Bring me back, bring me back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
When we both wake up underneath the same sun
Time stops, I wish that I could rewind
So close, but so far away

[Chorus: All]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you
She lies awake
I'm tryna find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you

[Bridge: Luke & Ashton]
There are pieces of us both
Under every city light
And they're shining as we fade into the night

[Breakdown: Calum]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was

[Chorus: All]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you
She lies awake
I'm tryna find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you

[Outro: Luke, Calum]
She lies awake
Beside you
I wish I was, I wish I was
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was39Embed
