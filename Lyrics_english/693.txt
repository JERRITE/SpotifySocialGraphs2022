Rulay Lyrics ["Rulay" letter]

[Intro]
Thus, haha

[Pre-car]
It seems that the sky ran out of stars
Because you got so fast that I almost stars me
Baby, you are not one of the others
You left me wanting to give you more
Today I will not miss the opportunity
I pass through you, but then I don't vo'a to leave
[Chorus]
Baby, tell your mai
That if he sees you with me, Andamo 'Rulay
Using a philliecito and a little 'e wine
Listening to Tego Calde and also dy, ah (haha)
Baby, tell your mai
That if he sees you with me, Andamo 'Rulay
Using a philliecito and a little 'e wine
Listening to Tego Calde and also dy, ah (baby)

[Verse]
Mommy, you have 'crazy (haha), crazy (ha)
Head bad, lazy (oky)
What a movie peliculeo, Gossip (Muah)
Very fan of your ass, Nasty
Mommy, let's hit the stuffed animal
Before 'I give you, and do not leave him' pa 'then (you know')
It doesn't matter if they listen to us
And that against fight
For you I put my hands to the fire (ey)
Sky, you know caramel
With just a little kiss knaches me like cane
I like everything about you, even how the hair takes you
I am a fan of all your pose ', preferable' those of the ground (Again)
Sky, you know caramel
With just a little kiss knaches me like cane
I like everything about you, even how the hair takes you
I am a fan of all your pose ', preferable' those of the ground (Again)
