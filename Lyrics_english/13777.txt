Morena Mía Lyrics [lyrics by "MORENA MÍA"]

[Verse 1]
Mine brunette
I'm going to tell you to ten
One the sun that shines you
Two your legs that send
We are three in your bed
Mine brunette
The room comes later
Five your continents
Six half tasks
Of my hot media
I keep telling right now
Well, well, good, good, good, good
Mine brunette
Seven are the sins committed
They add eight with me
NINE WHO I CHARGE YOU
More than ten I have felt
And for my part
There is plenty of art, what you give me
Give it to me, do it well
A little here and a little whom?
When your mouth
Touch me puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little
And move well
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
Morena Gata, Oh kills me! Kill me and finish me
Let's go for hell, put it not eternal
Soft good, well nobody like you know how to make coffee
But when your mouth
Touch me puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little
And move well
That nobody like you know how to make coffee

Well, well, good, good, good, good

[Verse 2]
Mine brunette if this is not happiness
That God goes down and see it
And even if it doesn't create it
This is glory
And for my part I put art
What you give me
Give it to me and give it well
A little like that and a little to whom?
When your mouth
Touch me puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little
And move well
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
MORENA GATA Oh kills me!
Kill me and finish me
Let's go pal 'hell
Put that is not eternal
Soft good, good
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
But when your mouth touches me
Puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little and move
Good good good
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
You might also like this if this is not happiness
That God goes down and see it
And even if it doesn't create it
This is glory
And for my part I put art
What you give me
Give it to me and give it well
A little like that and a little to whom?
When your mouth
Touch me puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little
And move well
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
MORENA GATA Oh kills me!
Kill me and finish me
Let's go pal 'hell
Put that is not eternal
Soft good, good
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
But when your mouth touches me
Puts me and causes me
Bitches me and destroys me
Everything is always little and move
Good good good
That nobody like you know how to make coffee
[Outro]
Well, good, well, well1embed
