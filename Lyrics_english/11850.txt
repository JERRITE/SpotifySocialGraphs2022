It was late Lyrics [lyrics of "You got late" ft. Jon Z, Ele a &
JAMBY THE FAVO]

[Intro: ñejo]
Too Late
Au, au, au, au
Ñejo el Broko

[Chorus: Ñejo]
He says he wants to see me (he says he wants to see me)
That 'tá crazy to return (that' tá crazy)
He says that it is not pa 'kids, what he wants is cock (au)
But you were late (Too Late), another that solves you
By me cagate in your mother (domain, nigga)
And go for shit (the fame all stars)
He says he wants to see me (he says he wants to see me)
That 'tá crazy to return (that' ta crazy to return)
He says that it is not pa 'Chavos (na'), that what he wants is cock (bug)
But you were late (Too Late), another that solves you (another crazy one that solves you)
For me cagate in your mother (in your father too)
And go to shit, do not miss
[Verse 1: ñejo]
For here you don't call because I'm no longer interested
I do not deny that I remember 'how rich fuck, how rich you kiss
How you passed the tongue on top 'and the head
Well, I look for the fucking list 'and sadness goes
You no longer have VIP
To 'the gifts that were pa' ti
I smoked them, I drank them
I put them on, I smeared them
And another person is occupying your space
Your love was rammed just like your straight hair
I who gave him a palace by little
I bought a rolex for little, I didn't deserve 'not a casio
If I know you, I don't even see you
Better crosses the street and follow it out there

[Pre-car: Jon Z]
I don't love you anymore, I had to tell you "goodbye"
I don't love you anymore, baby, late took you
I don't have you anymore, I'm better, thank God
I didn't lose you, you were the one who lost

[Chorus: Ñejo]
He says he wants to see me
That 'tá crazy to return (that' ta crazy to return)
He says that it is not pa 'Chavos (na'), that what he wants is cock (bug)
But you were late (Too Late), another that solves you (another crazy one that solves you)
For me cagate in your mother (in your father too)
And go to shit, do not miss

Now he wants to come back and it doesn't matter if he sticks them
You don't care if jangueo or at the time it arrives
Not how many times denies her, when he knows another whore
She won't come to you, now calls me and looks for me
Acho, go pars
I don't want a bitch that fucks me or barking
Now I have a golfa pair, I do trios and riot '
At first you do not want kids, in the end always a uncover
Do not call or pursue me, do not fuck me or exempt me
I hate your toto and you keep 'loving my cock
Why do you look at me? If I already reject you
I jump from my life, I no longer listen to you

[Pre-car: Jon Z]
I don't love you anymore, I have to tell you "goodbye"
I don't love you anymore, baby late took you
I don't have you anymore, I'm better, thank God
I didn't lose you, you were the one who lost

[Chorus: Ñejo]
He says he wants to see me (he says he wants to see me)
That 'tá crazy to return (that' ta crazy to return)
He says it is not pa 'kids, what he wants is cock (bug)
But you were late (Too Late), another that solves you (another crazy one that solves you)
For me cagate in your mother (in your father too)
And go to shit, don't miss (nigga domain)
[Verse 3: ele to the domain]
Here I have my penis surprising your vagina
I know that it also touches you 'and Bellaca imagines me'
You are with another now and does not let you live
But it was time for our death
I miss me to the nights and the day
You see me in the videos with whores, and you bit
You wanted to change myself, and I thank you
Now I buy condoms to 'the days in the pharmacy (ah)
I thought that nobody was going to make it so rich
Now I have a thousand brides in Colombia and Puerto Rico
You did not see me future because I sold Perico
Now I sell concerts and I'm getting rich (wuh)

[Bridge: Ele to the domain, Jamby el Favo]
You get fucking and now you want to see me
Your jevo throws a dust and then falls asleep
I don't want to see you, or give you a cock
That another solves you, my bug is on strike (Jamby)

[Verse 4: Jamby el Favo]
Now you want to go back, but I don't want you to come (no)
Go for the cock and apologize my jargon
I was pa 'ti, you eating the fuckin' shit
I hope you go away, to hell and get lost
You tell me that you are not interested in my kid '
But I don't interest me either, I have new jevas that nailed me
Do not come with the story that I am your favo (hmm)
If another bastard already put it to you, after all
When we broke, I asked for advice '
They told me not to cry and not be a asshole
I get a pair of notice, I smoke and I cleared me (normal)
Now you want to go back because I'm doing an album with Ñejo
Mera, slut, you think you know, it starts Pa'l Cajo
If you want to fuck, it's fine, but I get down and you down
I follow you the relax, with you I'm going down 'below
But without wrapping me because now weekly I travel

[Pre-car: Jon Z]
I don't love you anymore, I had to tell you "goodbye"
I don't love you anymore, baby late took you
I don't have you anymore, I'm better, thank God
I didn't lose you, you were the one who lost

[Chorus: Ñejo]
He says he wants to see me (he says he wants to see me)
That 'tá crazy to return (that' ta crazy to return)
He says that it is not pa 'Chavos (na'), that what he wants is cock (bug)
But you were late (Too Late), another that solves you (another crazy one that solves you)
For me cagate in your mother (in your father too)
And go to shit, don't get lost (na ')
