​nothinglastsforever Lyrics[Intro]
(Make me a sandwich, darling)
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I was told we're all tied by fate in a way
And before it all fades away, not to regret a single moment
But don't ever get attached
'Cause nothing lasts forever, uh
Don't you get fuckin' attached
'Cause nothing lasts forever
[Verse]
Talk big and tough, don't you?
But I know that you're black and blue
Change my mind
I can see right through you
But no one's gonna get that but me and you
I hope that you're safe wherever the fuck you are

[Bridge: TOKYO'S REVENGE & Slutty Sonny]
(What up, Jordon) Ooh, ooh, (Say hi, hi)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (You gon' make me a sandwich?)
Ooh, oh (I got you with materials, littlе peep)

[Chorus]
I was told we're all tied by fatе in a way
And before it all fades away, not to regret a single moment
But don't ever get attached
'Cause nothing lasts forever, uh
Don't you get fuckin' attached
'Cause nothing lasts forever

[Outro: TOKYO'S REVENGE & Slutty Sonny]
Look, it's chef—, wait, it's chef Sonny in the kitchen (Sheesh)
Yo', thank you for making me a sandwich, darling
This is for me
