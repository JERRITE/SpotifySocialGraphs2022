Shut Em Up Lyrics[Intro/Voicemail]
You gotta be fucking kidding me
Uh, Lauren pick up the phone
We have shit that we need to take care of
I have people on my ass
We have an interview at 2
I need you to pick up the phone
This is the five hundredth time I’ve called you
Please, you can’t just disappear like this

[Hook]
I don’t know who they keep talking to
Calling my phone like that, shut em up
Gimme some answers I want your attention like
I don’t care shut em up
Don’t have exact amount I don’t care
You gotta tell that bitch round it up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up
[Verse 1]
Nothing makes sense to me you not my friend you my enemy
All these mixed signals you sending me
Wrap em in blankets and send em to Indy with all of the memories left in me
I want it all on the table I need to be feeling all of your energy
And if these people are clouding my vision
I can't fucking focus on what the fuck’s meant to be
Shut em up

[Chorus/Hook]
I don’t know who you keep talking to
Calling my phone like that shut em up
Gimme some answers I want your attention like
I don’t care shut em up
Don’t have exact amount I don’t care
You gotta tell that bitch round it up
Shut em up, bitch, shut em up, shut em up

I don’t know who they keep talking to
Calling my phone like that shut em up
Gimme some answers I want your attention like
I don’t care shut em up
Don’t have exact amount I don’t care
You gotta tell that bitch round it up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up

I don’t know
I just been touring hella shows
I think this might be like all I know
I think I might need another dose
They offer money that’s not enough
They call me back, no that’s not enough
Go to Des Moines and they show me love
Empower the people that’s all I want

[Bridge]
This feels like a Californication
Shut my blinds and enter my vacation
Keep it quiet no communication
Baby face it, this is just the basics

[Chorus/Hook]
I don’t know who they keep talking to
Calling my phone like that shut em up
Gimme some answers I want your attention like
I don’t care shut em up
Don’t have exact amount I don’t care
You gotta tell that bitch round it up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up
[Outro]
I’m all on my own
Watch me while I blow up
Please don’t call my phone
Don’t you fucking show up baby
I’m all on my own
I’m all on my own
And I don’t need you no more

Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up, shut em up
Shut em up1Embed
