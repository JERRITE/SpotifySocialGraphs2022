Tunnel Lights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Caught the train, but missed my stop anyway
Oh, oh
Tripped on blankets asking for spare change
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tunnel lights, red and white
Conversations and pieces
Can't tell if it’s day or night
Am I wide awake or dreaming?
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
Hear it starting
Right where I'm supposed to be
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
That I stole from a city we know never sleeps
Dreaming
Oh, I'm ready
Take me home
Oh, I'm ready
Take me home

[Verse 2]
Yellow socks and shoes beating by the streets
Oh, oh
Slinging past headphones and magazines
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tunnel lights, red and white
Conversations and pieces
Can't tell if it’s day or night
Am I wide awake or dreaming?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
Hear it starting
Right where I'm supposed to be
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
That I stole from a city we know never sleeps
Dreaming
Oh, I'm ready
Take me home
Oh, I'm ready
Take me home

Strangers here together alone
Faces and stars I will never know

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
Hear it starting
Right where I'm supposed to be
Yeah, I'm just lost in a moment
That I stole from a city we know never sleeps
Dreaming
Oh, I'm ready
Take me home
Oh, I'm ready
Take me homeEmbed
