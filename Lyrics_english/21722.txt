Jenny Donâ€™t Be Hasty Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you'd marry me if I was 23
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only 18
Tell me who makes these rules
Obviously not you
Who are you answering to?

[Chorus]
Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
An' I'll be around again to see these other men
That are more adequate in the age department
I did not think you cared
There'd be no problems here
But now you're looking at me like you're disgusted and I'm
Definitely waiting for you to smile and change your mind
Then I'll say "I'm sorry" and I'll wrap my arms 'round your body
I really hope that you forgive in a hurry
And don't just ask me to leave

[Chorus]
Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me
Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect, then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
Now it sounds like you've just left me
And it kills me, so, woo

[Chorus]
Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me
Oh, Jenny you are crazy
First I'm perfect, then I'm lazy
And I was calling you my baby
Now it sounds like you've just left me
And it kills me
Oh, yeah
