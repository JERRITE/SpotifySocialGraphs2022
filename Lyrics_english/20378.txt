Man Down Lyrics[Intro: Shakka]
Jae5, it's a mad one

[Chorus: Shakka]
I'm like, man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my...
[Verse 1: Shakka]
It was all good on a weekend
She was servin' the pre drinks
She's the one with the thighs
The one with the feelin'
She said, "Hi" with a tongue ring, yeah
We both wanted somethin'
Phone calls to phone sex
Days off in my bed
She would only text when she horny
Next thing I know she callin' me like
"How's the mumzy? Can we fly away to Zante?
Baby, who's that girl in your selfie?
Why you ain't call the whole week?"
Yeah, fam this is ain't a top down
Fam you've got to slow down
Cupid got her in a drive by
Now man's callin' up the lads like

[Chorus: Shakka & Aluna Francis]
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like

If you want your life easy
Don't try and please me
You won't get nowhere
I'm a Kilimanjaro
If you go, aim low
I can't take you there
Baby, you're feelin' the power
Sweet and the sour
I am a dangerous flower
Baby you're gettin' a fever
I am your diva
You are my golden retriever
Wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna feel you
Doin' what you do
And wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna see you
So Voulez-vous
Get away from all this hype
Go and find the one you like
No need remindin' to love you
Ain't just tempted to touch you
And anything you want to buy
And anywhere you want to fly
No side guy, he's your guy
I don't wanna blow up the phone line
Callin' up the lads like
[Chorus: Shakka & Aluna Francis]
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my

[Verse 3: Shakka]
It was all good for the East End girl, West End boy
Wanted a change from Mile End Road
Ex man cheated, she didn't know
Now she wanna play the field some more
Like go down, go down, go down, go down, go down
She would only text when she horny
Like go down, go down, go down, go down, go down
Next thing I know she callin' me like
"How's the mumzy? Can we fly away to Zante?
Baby, who's that girl in your selfie?
Why you can't call the whole week?"
Yeah, fam this ain't a top down
Fam you've got to slow down
Now she swingin' like fight night
Next thing I'm callin' up the lads like

[Chorus: Shakka & Aluna Francis]
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like
Man down
Baby wanna take my life
She don't wanna be no side
She just wanna be my wife
Callin' up the lads like5Embed
