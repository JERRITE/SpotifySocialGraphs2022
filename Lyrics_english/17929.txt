Fall in love Lyrics ["Fall" letter "]

[Verse 1]
It was the beautiful thing of the sea, when you are by my side there is no other place
And it was the nice thing to be a couple in love
It was the beautiful thing about you, you never surrend until I was happy
And it is the most beautiful to know that you have never failed me

[Verse 2]
Now I know it's easy to say that I forgot you
That ours never existed and that I failed you
All for a damn mistake, it came upside down
I feel that today I love you more than normal
For the first time the pain is vertical
Time is uphill when you are not
[Chorus]
Fall in love-you again
I want to remind you how nice it is to see it
All in a cloud of the color of the sky
Fall in love-you again
Go down to earth and touch with your fingers
Sea water, your body with my body

[Verse 3]
It was the pretty of the sun, it always shone more and it was hotter
It was the most beautiful day if you were with me
It was the beautiful thing today, which is our anniversary and waiting
And I would even settle for being just friends

[Verse 2]
Now I know it's easy to say that I forgot you
That ours never existed and that I failed you
All for a damn mistake, it came upside down
I feel that today I love you more than normal
For the first time the pain is vertical
Time is uphill when you are not

[Chorus]
Fall in love-you again
I want to remind you how nice it is to see it
All in a cloud of the color of the sky
Fall in love-you again
Go down to earth and touch with your fingers
Sea water, your body with my body

Keep falling in love, keep chasing him
If the impulse comes from your heart
Like the air you do not see, that it gets inside you
Whatever happens, I will always be the one who will love you

[Chorus]
Fall in love-you again
I want to remind you how nice it is to see it
All in a cloud of the color of the sky
Fall in love-you again
Go down to earth and touch with your fingers
Sea water, enam√≥rateembed
