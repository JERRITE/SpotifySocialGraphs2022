I'm in a hurry, I hurry to make you
The happiest woman
From this world
But I don't care how much I should expect
So that it is so

When you look in my eyes
Believe them that are not lying
They can tell you
What you make Me Feel
All this time stop telling you
(Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeah)
(Baby Girl, if you knew how much I love you)
(Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeh Yeah)
(Looking in the eye I feel)
And I love you
And I'm not going to miss you anymore
(And I'm not going to lose you)
And I love you
And I need urgent
(A dose of you)
That when looking at you
I admire God and his creation more
(you're perfect for me)
There is a woman
You returned with you
The muse of my inspiration
(Ohhh)
(Only your doll)

You are the overwhelming test
That there are angels on earth
You do not see?
That I still still think
It is simply inertia
Also
My heart beats a thousand
When you are next to me
Sometimes I think I can't resist
Have you so close
But so far from me
If you leave me
I can make you happy
You might also like you are the last thing I see
Every time my eyes close
You do not see?
That your smile and your gaze
It is what my mind wakes up
Also

My heart beats a thousand
When you are next to me
Sometimes I think I can't resist
Have you so close
But so far from me
If you leave me
I can make you happy

I love you
And I'm not going to miss you anymore
(And I'm not going to lose you)
I love you
And I need urgent
(A dose of you)
That when looking at you
I admire God and his creation more
(You are perfect for me)
There is a woman
You returned with you
The muse of my inspiration
I'm in a hurry
To look at your body with sweet carisias
PARALIZES
Time when you release your smile
Crystallizes
The passion in such a precise way
I do not have doubts
If you touch me, you herges me

How much joy
Your presence brings me
I know you know
That you attract me a lot
You lift me
When my encouragement decays
All my Love
With your charm you extract it

(Hey doll)
(I'm in a hurry to get happy)
(tell me yes)
(You know what i mind)
(Heyme Roby)

(The perfect balance)

You are the overwhelming test
That there are angels on earth
You do not see?
That I still still think without thinking
It is simply inertia
Also
My heart beats a thousand
When you are not next to me
Sometimes I think I can't resist
Have you so close
But so far from me
If you leave me
I can make you happy

I love you
And I'm not going to miss you anymore
(And I'm not going to lose you)
I love you
And I need urgent
(A dose of you)
Looking at you
I admire God and his creation more
(You are perfect for me)
There is a woman
You returned with you
The muse of my inspiration
