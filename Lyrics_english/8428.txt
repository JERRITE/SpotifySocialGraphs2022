Kun Fu Lyrics ["Kun Fu" letter]

[Intro]
Flame Flame, Aha!
(Oddliquor, You Know)
Everything you need i got, daddy! AHA!

[Verse 1]
Kung Fu, Tarantino on the sheets
Mixed language, decipherible sequences
Sexual, rhythmic, relative, acceptable
Now you're leaving, I see far, 'niquilable
The phonetics' e your language, unpredictable
The Puerto Ricans sound inside
Unstable, Capic√∫a, It's a over
Make me in the foam body for discover
Circunferences in your center
Minimalism, spaghettis
Classic, Olympic, like that '
We mix, we escape
From the basics, historical
Five dimensions
Nuances and superheroes
But the syndrome, atmosphere
It's Slay
[Pre-car]
When you want i'm read for slay, drool
When you want i'm read for slay, drool
When you want i'm read for slay, drool
When you want i'm read for slay, drool
Ey Yo, Aha

[Chorus]
You are my fresh light
I need a Hurt Time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?

You are my fresh light
I need a Hurt Time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?

For you too my party
I GOT Just Sound, Papi
For you too my party
I GOT Just Sound, Papi

[Verse 2]
Three hours later in the abyss
Long nails, without enamel
You are the same, without City of that
Transitions, classify old songs
And vo 'hesitating in your eyebrows
Bars of your mystical optics, bluish
I have a white virgin, frost, that devours you
For two gold coins my pores breathe
In your meat honeycomb
Give Me Your Sugar, asshole
Shy Wondering
Why do you chase the rabbit, Alicia?
The tiles are clever shine, aha, ah
Shake your little ass, skinny, aha!

You are my fresh light
I need a Hurt Time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?

You are my fresh light
I need a Hurt Time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?

For you too my party
I GOT Just Sound, Papi
For you too my party
I GOT Just Sound, Papi

[Verse 3]
Stairs, hold my hips slow
I don't know how much you expect me
Hitting gum under the seat
I know that you put my clandestine accent
You become my den
You are with me planning the flight
Divided, surrendered to your feet being female
Being a man, being human, being hungry
Seven senses and the faste
I don't like how my pillow smells
Biggie sounds in the area, video-vigilada
The one with your neck suppates and look look, ah
[Chorus]
You are my fresh light
I need a Hurt Time
Thinkin 'in pleasure

[Outro]
Get Party to My World, I've Been Here
Get Party to My World, Here, Here
Get Party to My World, Here, Here
To my, to my world, here, here
I GOT SO HOT, FUCK ME
I GOTTA SO HOT, FUCK ME
I GOTTA SO HOT, FUCK ME
Oh, oh, I'm fuck me4embed
