One Minute More Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wait for an invitation
No need for reservation
This life is an exploration
And you gotta see what I see in you

[Chorus]
I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Just think of the destination
I'll be your transportation
We'll find there's a kind of place
That can only be seen with a naked mind

[Chorus]
I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
There's a key that opens a door
(Will you find it and turn it?)
Take your time, don't take too long
There's a map that's washed ashore
(Will you find it and burn it?)

[Verse 3]
Unleash your imagination
Two stars, one constellation
Bright lights just to guide the way
Can you see what I see in you?
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine

[Instrumental]6Embed
