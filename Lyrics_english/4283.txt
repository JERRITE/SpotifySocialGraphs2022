TranslationShnicky Jam: BzRP Music Sessions, Vol. 41 Lyrics [lyrics by "Nicky Jam: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 41"]

[Intro: Nicky Jam]
(The Byza released her and rang a bastard
Baby tried it and fell in love
They called me to record and this pod fell screwed
This is not about La Mata, the one who kills her is me)

[Verse 1: Nicky Jam]
I'm still in the game, to 'the world knows how Brego
Twenty year 'and I undefeated', in this I am Diego
In the 86 cup, the law bursting
There is no defense that can with me, baby, there is no break
This' know
That when I get this here, they don't fit
And without setting pressure, the low of the ship
E 'very easy to mount a number one, like me none
The other I left for Picky
Come a caravan, and say: "Look, there goes Nicky"
The Babie 'in Miami all' I put their tiskey
Og like Miky
I have a Cuban and I tell that "kiki"
She tells me: "Do you love me?" (Kiki), but when Horny is
Ask that booty with mine to adorn it
And a Colombian, I took the visa
And came co 'a mine for my partner Byza
[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
The Byza released her and rang a bastard
Baby tried it and fell in love
They called me to record and this pod fell screwed
This is not about La Mata, the one who kills her is me
The Byza released her and rang bastard (-brón)
Baby tried it and fell in love
They called me to record and this pod fell screwed
This is not about La Mata, the one who kills her is me

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
N-I-C-K, Nicky Jam, I'M The King of the Flow
I'm killin 'it smowly for all you motherfuckers that know me
I Started This Game, so there you rookies pay 'cause you owe me
Or I'MA LEAVE YOUR FACE SCARRED Like Tony Montana
To's want money, to's want fame (fame)
Ride a bugatti, buy a couple of Cuban '
But they don't think about what will come tomorrow
You have to capitalize on what the wool is never missing

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
The Byza released her and rang a bastard
Baby tried it and fell in love
They called me to record and this pod fell screwed
This is not about La Mata, the one who kills her is me
The Byza released her and rang a bastard
Baby tried it and fell in love
They called me to record and this pod fell screwed
This is not e 'de la Mata (Yeah), the one who kills her is me (Yeah)
