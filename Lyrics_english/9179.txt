Hunger on Hillside (Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
And I’ma start right here, right by the finish line
Because I stay ahead of things like I invented time
The way I flip a metaphor like it’s an hourglass
Got every bar I spit resembling a checkout line
‘Cause by the time you register it, everything is cold
I’m in my bag, because I always got some things in store
My cylinder is graduated, worth my weight in gold
I got you turning up the volume like nobody home
And I’ll split a pussy rapper in half like a camel toe
I got a OLED TV mounted in my room
And I ain’t ever turn it on, I just enjoy the view
I guess this spending money thing is just something I do
Ever since I made a fucking killing after sparing me
I been through the wringer, I done took me like a hundred L’s
Every song I dropped before this year became a fire sale
Now I stoke the fire like the flames are my achilles heel
And I’m back and somehow I got better I’m Kevin Durant
Only difference now is my reflection is a looking glass
I turned who I was and who I wasn’t into who I am
And that motherfucker is impressive, I would be his friend
Even if the only reason why was to encourage him
Made it through a world where I ain’t ever had nobody else
If I wanted something, I just had to do that shit myself
I respect the people that ain’t have to do the same thing
But if life’s a game, well, then, I guess I’m just the final boss
I’ve been trying to figure out what’s next, but maybe, this is it
Maybe I don’t give a fuck if I am known for anything
Maybe I just wanted some stability so I could turn the benefits into a life where I don’t have to stress again
And it seems like everybody suffering from jealousy
Treating every like and every tweet like it’s some medicine
Doing everything when everything has never been enough
Just so they can get some recognition from someone they love
Take it from me, I speak from experience
I just been adding commas, y’all just missing periods
I delegate my motivations to my brilliance
And turn that genius into these songs for your convenience
Just took a look inside the mirror, I’m the goat, boy
The only rapper that I know that isn’t broke, boy
It’s everybody taking shots that got no scopes, boy
Every single time I catch a glimpse they get exposed, boy
It’s just a race against myself, I’m trying to keep up
It’s like I’m talking to myself and I’m just speechless
It’s like your bitch will only text me on the weekends
And the only language that she speaks is cunnilingus
You arm and arm, I’m Armie Hammer, and I taste blood
You in my motherfucking lane, and I am Caitlyn
It’s like you’d do like anything to become famous
But you got a face that’s like a Derek Chauvin mugshot
You should probably suck a dick instead like Kim K
I know a couple dudes that look just like they Ray J
I know a couple dudes that’d probably say they hate me
Imagine me caring ‘bout some dudes that never made it
Y’all be rapping like you Ice Cube with a Jheri Curl
But you sound like you put ice cubes in strawberry milk
I could never hit a bitch, but you is something else
Wouldn’t even take your bummy ass to fucking In-N-Out
Something like your live sets, they want you in and out
While I just book my own shit, and then I pay myself
I could never fucking starve along a hillside
I would move a mountain just to get a better sunrise
I stay strapped with every key, I’ll open any door
And every time I make a hit, I need a couple more
And I’m swinging like I’m Floyd in round eleven, when
I can see you’re gassed, because you never had to go the length
I won’t show you all my cards with every single play
But don’t forget, I keep a house that’s full like Mary-Kate
Just know that everybody fed like it’s a dinner date
Know we celebrating our last supper every single day
And I’m getting to the point, but, I ain’t made it yet
If you ain’t seen me at my worst, you’ll never see my best
And when I tell my girl I love her, I don’t even ask
‘Cause I know she's always gonna say that shit right back
I’m just having me a blast, sometimes I reminisce
Like, when I tatted Breakdown back in 2010
Cole was rapping ‘bout his father after mine died
Said he hated him, but that he wanted one so damn bad
And I couldn’t shake that fact, because what’s how I felt
But all that struggle is what made me find my damn self
‘Cause I ain’t ever had nobody I could turn to
So I started writing so that I could be somebody else
And now the only thing I know is me, bitch
And you’re never gonna be me, bitch
Went from rapping as a dream, to a rapper with a dream
Now I’m 29 and rap like I’m on Dreamville
And I ain’t even need to prove it no more
But, just in case you don’t remember, here you go
I wrote this song in 20 minutes, just checked the score
There won’t ever be another me, and that’s for damn sure
I used to wonder if the clock would reset itself
Or if I’d have to find the time to invest in myself
And so I put a lifetime into me, and
Now I got you looking like you don’t want to be here
I don’t even need a beat and that’s facts, though
Everybody always fronting through the back door
Everybody got a problem ‘til they need something
And it seems like every day somebody fucking needs something
Swear to God, I think I have to be 100 in
Like I’m filling up the tank inside the tour van
Now it’s been like 21 entire minutes, and
I got me a women that’s been waiting in my king bed
So I have to hit the stop, dawg, it's peace out
But we know you ‘bout to hit the fucking restart
Even if you fucking hate me, dawg, run it back
Show it to your favorite rapper, so he knows he isn’t shit
I’ve been nice to all these fake fucks too long
And I tried to keep it short, this feel like two songs
So, I got to cut me off, I got some shit to do
And if we ever cross paths, I will not remember youYou might also likeEmbed
