Let you kiss you Lyrics [see 1]
Let them find out
As I love you
And how you love me
Let them look at us
When you fall in love
Do not complain
Let my soul shine
Tell me what to do
What do i do with you
Do not get sorrow
I ask you for my life
I am not afraid
But now is when I want
[Pre-chorus]
Let me look at you
And that I kiss you if I can

[Chorus]
You are a necessity
And only with a couple of kisses
You can melt my fire
You can set up my sea
If you don't kiss me
Your mouth takes the wind
And how do I say sorry
To this body that wants to love
You are chance
More beautiful that the sky brought me
Who said I'm awake
If I don't stop dreaming
If you don't kiss me
Your mouth takes the wind
And how do I say sorry
To this body that wants to love

[See 2]
let me kiss you
let me kiss you
Let it try
Let it invite you
To fall in love tonight
One night here between thousands

Never forget
It has not been easy
Because I'm dying in your profiles
You have caught me
Do not trust

[Pre-chorus]
let me kiss you
He promises you
And let me forget you

[Pre-chorus]
You are a necessity
And only with a couple of kisses
You can melt my fire
You can set up my sea
If you don't kiss me
Your mouth takes the wind
And how do I say sorry
To this body that wants to love

You are chance
More beautiful that the sky brought me
Who said I'm awake
If I don't stop dreaming
If you don't kiss me
Your mouth takes the wind
And how do I say sorry
To this body that wants to love
Who wants to love
What loves love
Who wants to love
Who wants to love1embed
