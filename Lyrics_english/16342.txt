Always and Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always and forever, each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

[Chorus]
Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you forever, forever
[Verse 2]
There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely, phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

[Chorus]
Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you ever, ever

[Bridge]
Loving you, is a thing that I've planned
For a very long time (Always forever love you)
Me with you, you with me, we as one
Love together, for a very long time (Always forever love you)
Loving you, you (Always forever love you)
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
Always forever love you

[Outro]
I said forever, ever love you
Love you, ever and a day, and one day
Loving you (Always forever love you)
Forever (Always forever love you)
Tomorrow knows, tomorrow knows
Forever and a day, ever and a day (Always forever love you)
Ever and a day (Always forever love you)
You, loving you, forever, ever (Always forever love you)
You, you
