Glowing in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know how I get when the sun goes down
How it feels when no one's around
I know, I know-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know-oh-oh
I get kind of lost and I can't see straight
Hate it but it's just what we take
I know, I know-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been bitten by the lonely
But when I'm not the only
When I'm, when I'm not the only
One who feels it, maybe it's sick to say
But it helps that you feel the same
I know, I know-oh-oh
When the lights go out
[Chorus]
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now
Dark days but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh, oh, woah-oah-oh
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark

[Verse 2]
Doin' two-way then way above the clouds
Rooftop, yeah, we're just hanging out
I know, I know-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know-oh-oh
Now we're looking down like we got no fear
We got dreams and they start right here
I know, I know-oh-oh-oh
I know, I know-oh-oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
We get bitten by the lonely
But we're not the only
Yeah, we're, yeah, we're not the only
Ones who know that the way to get through the night
Is to bring on a little bright
I know, I know-oh-oh
When the lights go out

[Chorus]
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now
Dark days but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh, oh, woah-oah-oh
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark
[Bridge]
When I'm bitten by the lonely
You can get to know me
I know, I know-oh-oh

[Chorus]
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
Glowing in the dark
We'll light up Central Park
We're lights that never go out
'Cause you're here with me now
Dark days but it's alright
So fine, every night
Oh, oh, woah-oah-oh
We're glowing in the dark
We started from a spark
We're lights that never go out
Like we've never been down
