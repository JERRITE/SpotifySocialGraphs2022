The Dream Calls for Blood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look me in the eyes and preach shit
About what I need
In the same damn cage for years and years
While you run free
Best hope and pray to the sky above
That I never break out
But know that I will and when I do
I'm going to silence that mouth

[Chorus]
The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for blood
[Verse 2]
You gloat and boast about yourself
It's so obscene
Onlookers gasp in shear dismay
At your routine
There was a day so long ago
When you fought right
Truth be told you've grown so soft
Days turned to night

[Chorus]
The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
My dreams are payed with patience
Persistent and aware
Your lack of integrity
Self gorging without care
I'll humble and expose you
Stand proud as you collapse
You might also like[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Pity for you, well, let it be known
That I have none
But the knowledge you taught so unaware
How it shouldn't be done
I'll keep the fire alive and the hunger inside
'Till I shall pass
So the dream I love with all my blood
Will forever last

[Alternate Chorus]
The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough
Words of scorn can't stop me
This hunger only grows
Steadfast to ignore me
Is why you fell so far below
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for blood
Dream calls for bloodEmbed
