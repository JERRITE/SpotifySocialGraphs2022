The Lime Tree LyricsRing around my soul
Pocket full of pain posies
My search for freedom continues
But to no avail

The sloth breathes it, not I
He sits atop a tree
With his crown and scepter
Surveying His domain
His glorious terrible domain
Who am I you ask?
Martha Stewart in her car

A ferret jumps on her face
Tearing at her flesh
Not able to see the road
She crashes into a lime tree

I am that lime tree
Show me a sloth
I'll show you a log
Where am I?
In the river of strife
As are we all

Floating on a log
Struggling to breathe the air of truth
Get off the log
Get on the jet ski
And ride it to light speed
Captain
Off the log
Get on the jet ski
And ride it to light speed Captain
Freedom

Dig deep deeper
You hit the water pipe
And the truth sprays out

You want to know the truth
Dig deep deeper
You hit the water pipe
And the truth sprays out

Ring around my soul

A ferret jumps on her face
Tearing at her flesh
Not able to see the road
She crashes into a lime tree
(Yea!)

I am that lime tree
Show me a sloth
I'll show you a log
Where am I?
In the river of strife
As are we all

You want to know the truth
Dig deep deeper
You hit the water pipe
And the truth sprays out
You want to know the truth
Dig deep deeper
You hit the water pipe
And the truth sprays outEmbed
