You and I are oneself Lyrics [lyrics of "you and I are oneself"]

[Verse 1]
The sun does not shine as before it did it around me
What reason could I give me if everything in ours was perfection?
I have dedicated myself to love and take care of her, and so it corresponds to me?
Without even goodbye, see you later, you kill my illusions

And until today I remember you listening to a sad song
I feel, slowly drowned in my room
Day by day on the streets, without hope
Imagining, thinking if you still remind me

UOH UH UH-OH-OH
UOH UH UH-OH

[Chorus]
And I don't want to forget you, maybe you come back
And here I will be, waiting for you, love
You can't deny it
You and I are oneself, oh, oh

Fights, discussion and your great passion
Even if you run away, you will always know
You and I are oneself, oh, oh
