OW, OW, Come on
Oh yes, ha, let go, come on
[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, uh, come on, Madonna

[Verse 1: Madonna, Justin]
Let's go boy
I've been waiting for someone to accompany me
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you want to have fun, mmm
I want someone to accelerate for me and then go slow
There is enough room for both
Girl, I can handle it, just have to show me where it is
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?

[Pre-Statement: Madonna and Justin]
If you want that, you've already got
If you thought about it, it is better than what you want
If you feel it, it must be real, just
Say the word and I'll give you what you want

[Chorus: Madonna, Justin]
Time is waiting
We have only four minutes to save the world
Without hesitation
Grab a boy, get a girl

Time is waiting
We have only four minutes to save the world
Without hesitation
We have only four minutes, heh, four minutes
