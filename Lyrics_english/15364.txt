Going Inside Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't throw your life away
Going inside
You get to know who's watchin' you
And who besides you resides
In your body
Where you're slow, where you go doesn't matter
'Cause there will come a time when time goes out the window

[Chorus 1]
And you'll learn to drive out of focus, I'm you
And if anything unfolds, it's supposed to
Ooh
[Verse 2]
You don't throw your time away sitting still
I'm in a chain of memories, it's my will
And I had to consult some figures of the past
And I know someone after me will go right back

[Chorus 2]
I'm not telling a view
I've got this night to unglue
I moved this fight away
By doing things there's no reason to doYou might also like2Embed
