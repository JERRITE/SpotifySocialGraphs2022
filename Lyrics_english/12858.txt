Throw Shade Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you meet your maker
Tell him I already know
This is an undertaker
When sell your soul
And don't you get me started
I don't believe a word you say
She's saying she's an artist
I thought you were a hurricane

[Pre-Chorus]
You're dead to me, rest in peace
You can't let me be
[Chorus]
If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey, I'll see you never
See you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey, I'll see you never
See you never, I'll see you never
I'll see you never hey, I'll see you never

[Verse 2]
I know you're nothing but an enemy
You've been tripping on a brand new way
I got your fake identity
And I go, if I go back
Spend your money on a Ma Tai
And then you sipping on a French rose
I've been saving for a city wide
I'll give you awful way

[Pre-Chorus]
You're dead to me, R.I.P
You can't let me be
You might also like[Chorus]
If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never
See you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never

[Bridge]
Good riddance
I mean I'm really gonna miss you, though
Good riddance
I mean it's oh so sad to see you go

[Chorus]
If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you, I'll see you
I'll see you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never
See you never, I'll see you never1Embed
