Donâ€™t Listen To The Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the radio
Hear something that ya 'ready know
I got no radio

[Verse 2]
Don't speak upon the telephone
Hear somethin' that you're never shown
I got no telephone

[Chorus]
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
[Verse 3]
Don't listen to the TV show
Feel someone that you 'ready know
I got no T.V.O

[Chorus]
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today, yeah
(Oh yeah I say)
Get out the way today, yeahYou might also like1Embed
