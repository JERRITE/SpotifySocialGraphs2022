Verse x verse Lyrics [letter of "verse x verse" ft. Almighty]

[Verse 1: OMY GOLD]
I'm like the sun, bastard, I'm hot without heater
A sport on the nail the aventor
As I walk with Almighty, change the comb and 'I amount to the drum
We are not human, we arrive from abroad, ah!
Tell him, custom
THE RETRO ARE CUSTOM
I like Baby with the Angosto
I take them, I don't care about the cost
If I get tired of fame, I retire and
Bastard, I make a change 'e face, jah (OMY!)
[Verse 2: Almighty]
I turn a phillie, and I move on the mantarraya
I put on the gloves pa 'cough' throw the 'towel'
Tan 'ready the metrals
I'm crazy like Jocky and Tipitaya
Lookin 'for a pair of papaya'
I continue on fire
I don't know that you buy bararatex (cheap)
The kilos by Fedex
Nailing my ex's friends (Wuh)
I already live like a bug like (mommy)
You want to be when you see me
I call your doña
And he asked me for a bow, Lucia
I arrived as a policeman
Yes, the one I put you was me because I was driving (rrra)
Yeh, you have empty to'as accounts
Game Changer

[Verse 3: OMY of gold]
Kobe and Jordan got together in the same pace
The stars, the sign
I am malignant
Bastard, this is going to be a hymn
Always real without mirage '
After this they will accuse us of terrorism
Do not call me-call that I never lame it
The cane like the notorious, but I am not lame
You are not really, I see it in your eye '(Yeh, Yeh)
I have an angel that looks at me, I don't need dispossession, red (OMY!)
Red the Outfit Gucci, Red El Ferra (RRR)
Red my blood, but I don't come to these lands
Since I'm in Share That Music no door closes
I get your wife while Gallic your body buries, ah!

Truquero 'Like Batman
And I don't knocke to 'the one who comes to Josearme as Pacman does
I am very hard picando tell me Chapman (what?)
They are going to call you all those who catch you
Today I am illustrious, as well as Julia de Burgos
I like celebrities, but na 'dissemination
Millionaire blondes living in Luxembourg (Mommy)
Come bersly to the grooming that I aspire them
Give it, téme, water I am spicy
I live missioning my life and 'a Grand Theft Auto Vice, Yeh
The tits was made and Juicy has them
Your empanadilla is with my Icee
Almighty!

[Verse 5: OMY of gold]
They snore me and have vento engine
I go out like the wolves on a full moon to give him a scarer
The cut under the seat
Guerrear with me is like war against the wind
They don't feel until I arrive and start the event
Hehe, today we are Pa'l Putero
Almighty, these bastards have accounts at zero
And so they snore, I do have thousands like Duncan
I take the tool and legs of her unscrew
I set the propeller '
We smoke 'until the overflower arrives
We are Pussy Lovoves
I walk with 5 bastards at the Range Rover
In the neck 150 and on the feet the Red October
[Outro: Almighty, OMY GOLD]
OMY
It's The Game Changer
Indicates Almighty
Do not talk about Chantear Cabrone ', that you do not know what that is
OMY, OMY
The devil in skates
Tell me OMY
Alex Killer, Alex Killer
You know what is happening
I always walk with custom
Ledo Kingz
Tell me Young Boss
Primo Boyz Music
OMY, OMY
