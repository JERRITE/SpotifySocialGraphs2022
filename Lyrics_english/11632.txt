Why Do You Feel So Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't speak and I can't listen
And everyone is a curse or something worse
What can I say to the kid that made you?
Complaining like you were made to
When you hate every God I pray to

[Chorus]
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I'd like to be
But why do you feel so down?
Again, I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
[Verse 2]
I've gone weak and
I'm sick of speakin'
So hear me out, you're the cure
Or something more
I think you're one of a kind so I'll never like myself
I think you're older and wiser so I won't let you tell
I think it over and over and hope you're thinking too
I think it over and over and hope I'm over you

[Chorus]
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down? (Why do you feel so down?)
Again, I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down? (Why do you feel so down?)
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?

[Bridge]
Everyone, I messed up again
Everyone, I messed up again (Hm-hm, hm-hm, hm)
Everyone, I messed up again
Everyone
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down? (Why do you feel so down?)
Again, I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down? (Why do you feel so down?)
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down? (Why do you feel so down?)

[Outro]
