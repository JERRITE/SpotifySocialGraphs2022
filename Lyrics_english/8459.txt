[Enter: Tego Calderón]
Mere who, mere who, mere who arrives
Good thing
Black Calde without problem, men

[Pre-Caro: Anuel Aa & Tego Calderón]
NO again 'Dejamo' in seen, he mistreats me 'of Distito'
Why don't you visit me 'If you need me' and I need you?
I know he also wants to eat me (Yeh)
But without compromising (Yeh-Yeh)
Then 'this' clear', baby, speaking of course: real until death (brrr)
[Chorus: Anuel AA, Anuel Aa & Tego Calderón]
He went out to Janguear to have a good time and behave badly (behaving badly)
She does not want to relationship, she and 'the pressure, she and' the end (ey, the law; she and 'the end)
I went out to janguear to have a good time and behave badly
He no longer wants to know about love, he just wants alcohol and gets drunk

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
She kills with the 'outfit (with the' outfit)
She and 'my natti, I her raphy (her raphy)
No 'junmo' and e '"game over" (game over)
I really, Mai ', I looked for the Range Rover (uah)
A vece 'I confuse' (-Funde ')
There is no boyfriend, but I know who sinks it (who sinks)
People hate about their outfit ask him (no, no, no)
She and I so 'the real together, Yeah-Yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Caro: Anuel AA]
And just want jangueo (jangueo)
Bellaqueo and Fumeteo (smoke)
The 'haater' takes the de'o (the de'o)
Zero Gardeo (Gardeo, no, no, no)
He is single and wants Jangueo (Jangueo)
Bellaqueo and Fumeteo (smoke, -oo)
Your body asks Perreo (Perreo)
Zero Gardeo (Uah, Uah; BRR)
