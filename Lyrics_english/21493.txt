Tea Party Lyrics[Chorus]
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
That's okay, that's okay
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up, hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

[Verse 1]
Your appetite is wet, I've got the table set
Don't get your dribble on my t-t-t-table yet
I've got the goodies baked, got more than you can take
Just try a nibble of my biscuits and my rainbow cake
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's be traditional
And unconditional
Elbows down, pinkies up
That's the way you sip my cup

[Chorus]
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
That's okay, that's okay
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up, hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

[Verse 2]
Try not to move so fast, you know dessert comes last
I'm a lady, futhermucker, try to show some class
Down to the last cup, we keep it boiling hot
We keep the party moving till we drink the last drop

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's be traditional
And unconditional
Elbows down, pinkies up
That's the way you sip my cup
You might also like[Chorus]
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
That's okay, that's okay
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up, hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

[Bridge]
I know this night is like no other
And you're not just a lover
(Porcelain in a paper cup world)
(Tip me over and pour me out)
I know it's only getting better
As long as we're together
(Porcelain in a paper cup world)
(Tip me over and pour me out)
I know this night is like no other
And you're not just a lover
(Porcelain in a paper cup world)

[Chorus]
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
That's okay, that's okay
Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up, hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me outEmbed
