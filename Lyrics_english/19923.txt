Cut Through Me Lyrics[Intro]
Lines of white, yeah, I'm doing cocaine
She say she love me, but I can't take the pain
You cut through me...

[Hook: MoneyPosse Tyler]
Lines of white, yeah, I'm doing cocaine
She say she love me, but I can't take the pain
You cut through me, I thought you knew me
Feeling fucked up. Our love is like a movie
Lines of white, yeah, I'm doing cocaine
She say she love me, but I can't take the pain
You cut through me, I thought you knew me
Feeling fucked up. Our love is like a movie
[Verse: Lil Tracy]
You cut through me, got me feeling like a coke rock
She asked me to come over, I'm at the jewelry shop
Can't keep loving on these thots, bitch, I need the guap
She said she gon' hold me down, bitch, no you not
Lines of white, yeah, I'm doing cocaine
(?) Coke is on my ex, shawty licking on my face

All they see is MoneyPosse, yeah, we getting lit
