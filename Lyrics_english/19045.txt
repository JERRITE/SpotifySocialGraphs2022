Let the World Burn LyricsA sea of heartbreak, a sea of pain
Oceans of blood, scarring decay
A stripped surface, a shredded sky
Venom from hell, born from your lies

Vio-Lence so lethal. salting the land
Surface deformed I see cleansing of man
Filth filled with lies, melting like wax
A time so divine, give them death

Let the world burn
I want to see it burn
Let the world burn
Let you fucking burn
A poisoning lung, a victim's demands
Love laced kindness, murdering hand
A blind desperation, a sickening display
A woman with child, its blood paving the way

Vio-Lence so lethal. salting the land
Surface deformed I see cleansing of man
Filth filled with lies, melting like wax
A time so divine, give them death

Eruption of screams, laughing insane
Dreams burnt away by acid laced rain
Abortions of flesh, cover the soil
Come witness your suffering

Let the world burn
I want to see it burn
Let the world burn
Let you fucking burn

You've never been welcome
Sluts for lust Virus
You destroy your saviors
Unrecognized, then crucified
Now the tidal wave of flames
The wind, the blood, the weak and their cries
It's never pretty, it's beautiful desperation, it's romance
LET THE WORLD BURN
You might also likeThis is your future, it's your loved ones
Everything you worship, every person you hate
As the curtain closes, the novel concludes........

BURN
All you fuckers
BURN

Vio-Lence so lethal. salting the land
Surface deformed I see cleansing of man
Filth filled with lies, melting like wax
A time so divine, give them death

Eruption of screams, laughing insane
Dreams burnt away by acid laced rain
Abortions of flesh, cover the soil
Come witness your suffering

Let the world burn
I want to see it burn
Let the world burn
Let you fucking burnEmbed
