Dancing around Lyrics [letter of "dancing around"]

[Intro]
(Yesterday I saw her)
Yesterday I saw her for a long time and ...
(With her friends in a street in Madrid)
I regret so much goodbye
(They were the happiest days for me)

[Chorus]
Yesterday I saw her dancing around
With her friends on a street in Madrid
As nice as the day I met her
They were the happiest days for me
Yesterday I saw her dancing around
With her friends on a street in Madrid
As nice as the day I met her
They were the happiest days for me

[Verse 1]
She and 'crazy for Latin rhythm
Turns on the track dancing with me
The aroma, it touches, looks at me
And I electronically ignite
I don't dare, oh-oh to tell him na'a
I get the hard asking for a drink
Sitting in the bar bar (ah)
I approach your side, I play my hair
He singed to his ear 'ear
You would like 'an appointment with me
I follow you on Twitter, if you want to write you
Suddenly, his boyfriend arrived already
If you are not going to take it

[Bridge]
(Yesterday I saw her)
It is inevitable to see her
As a couple is lost in the routine
The daily things' of life
(Yesterday I saw her)
And and that's why I should 'give your baby a smile every day
(Yesterday I saw her dancing for me)

That boyfriend he has faces me
I put a bad face and feel
If your girl doesn't want me calm
I erase me and I'm leaving the party
But I know what you want more
