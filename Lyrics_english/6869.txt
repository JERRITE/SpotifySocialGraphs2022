John Wayne Gacy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh no, Dad, it's okay, Dad
You’re just boozin', I'm just cruisin’, we can hold back
Come on, Dad, it's okay, Dad
We're just bruisin', it's amusin', we can go back, oh
Oh, such a pretty face, made to deliver
Exit through the crawlspace or into the river
Took the charges for the ultimate thrill
Kentucky Fried Chicken and kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Timothy, who? John, Darrell, Randall, Sam, Michael, and Billy
Jimmy, who? Ricky, someone, Kenneth, who? Michael, Willy
Greg, a boy, and Jon, and John, Matthew, a boy, Rob, and John
Russell, and Robert, and Tommy, and David
And William, Timothy, Frankie, and James
Robert, who else?
Who, who, who?
Maybe you
[Chorus]
Thirty-three boys, Pogo the Clown is back
Oh, thirty-three toys, ol' John is back on track
All thirty-three pled, I had my fun at last
Now everyone is dead and you can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
Funeral parlour decoy, nothing to rack up
Little Gacy, fat boy, deep under the makeup
Man of the year, man of fear, man of will
Join the Jolly Joker Club and kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Timothy, who? John, Darrell, Randall, Sam, Michael, and Billy
Jimmy, who? Ricky, someone, Kenneth, who? Michael, Willy
Greg, a boy, and Jon, and John, Matthew, a boy, Rob, and John
Russell, and Robert, and Tommy, and David
And William, Timothy, Frankie, and James
Robert, who else?
Who, who, who?
Maybe you

[Chorus]
Thirty-three boys, Pogo the Clown is back
Oh, thirty-three toys, ol' John is back on track
All thirty-three pled, I had my fun at last
Now everyone is dead and you can kiss my ass
You might also like[Bridge]
Cloth and chloroform, leaving nothing much to find
Road signs flyin’ by in a twilight state of mind
Norwood Park’s dry, the rest for you guys to find
Thirty-three and more in the crawlspace of my mind

[Chorus]
Thirty-three boys, Pogo the Clown is back
Oh, thirty-three toys, ol' John is back on track
All thirty-three pled, I had my fun at last
Now everyone is dead and you can kiss my ass

[Post-Chorus]
Timothy, who? John, Darrell, Randall, Sam, Michael, and Billy
Jimmy, who? Ricky, someone, Kenneth, who? Michael, Willy
Greg, a boy, and Jon, and John, Matthew, a boy, Rob, and John
Russell, and Robert, and Tommy, and David
And William, Timothy, Frankie, and James

[Outro]
Thirty-three boys
Oh, thirty-three toys
Thirty-three boys
Oh, thirty-three toys1Embed
