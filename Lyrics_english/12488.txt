Ugly Ending Lyrics[Intro]
It's come to an ugly ending
It’s come to an ugly ending
It's come to an ugly ending
It's come to an ugly ending

[Verse 1]
It’s nothing like I thought it'd be
It's not how I imagined
It's interesting, but not enough
To justify the action
It's left me feeling kind of weak
It's bleak, anticlimactic
It's come to an ugly ending
It's come to an ugly ending
[Chorus]
You don’t mind if I lie for a moment
I think that flowers gonna spring up, make this weather break
Close your eyes, synthesize different versions
I tell myself these little myths I don’t even believe in

[Verse 2]
Now I'm bored, I’d like to skip ahead
And see the ending
I'm scrolling forward, I hit ignore
It's hard to keep pretending
I canceled plans, I washed my hands
The feeling's still impending
It’s come to an ugly ending
It's come to an ugly ending

[Chorus]
You don't mind if I lie for a moment
I think that flowers gonna spring up, make this weather break
Close your eyes, synthesize different versions
I tell myself these little myths I don't even believe in

[Bridge]
When it all came crashing down
No guns, no flames, no sounds
Got no armies hosing crowds
Just some kids talking way too loud
Just some kids talking way too loud
You might also like[Chorus]
You don't mind if I lie for a moment
I think that flowers gonna spring up, make this weather break
Close your eyes, synthesize different versions
I tell myself these little myths I don't even believe in1Embed
