Pa ’that frog lyrics [letter of" pa 'that frolHling "]

[Intro]
Hey, the abayarde
Tego Calde with DJ Joe
Getting bastard, hey

[Verse 1]
This is for you to enjoy it
Tego Calderón, to retouch
I smell new, I feel up to date, in mine, mommy
I am well perfuming 'and the paca, in case it does not trust
Without mystery, pay with pleasure
That the world ends, today I did not come to lose
Turn cell phones, report their homes
Today I do look at evil
They move their cu-how when I throw my su-su
At the waist I bring my tun-tun
Mommy, I want to grab you by hair
While I throw my obscene language
I am the most
You would like your body crushing
With this bamboo I always make disaster '
I don't wear off
That you know 'that I make it shine
I am the Number One, I'M Má 'Monster than those of Thriller
[Chorus]
This is for you
To enjoy it
To enjoy it
To rub it
Hey, this is for you
To enjoy it
To enjoy it
To rub it

[Verse 2]
Hears
Come on, brunette, culipandea that bat
Cashea, but also Pichea
The Golfea, that does not fantastate
They hear my song and how they border
It doesn't matter where I see me, yours is the one that fills me
Joy for my body and do not smell the lilies
It is the black Jiggiri, the enemy of the Guasibiris
The one that never throws trililí
Sandunga pa 'las ladies, taste here pa' ti
Mami, sesame bachata
Give it to the corner, to put it in China
Hey, if the most whores are the finest
Say what they say, vamo 'to enjoy' life
Nor crazy, protect me the mine, mika
Don't get me cohíba and demand
Unless you want to make your suitcase '
This is not a game
See you later, I see you later
Take advice from Tego Pa 'that arrives' to old
If you go 'to Güiro Pelao' and it comes out reward 'you'
For not having a hubs' that is foul
At the last minute, gózate it with the clothes on
Work costs, nobody thinks when you are going to give Yesca

This is for you
To enjoy it
To enjoy it
To rub it
Hey, this is for you
To enjoy it
To enjoy it
To rub it

[Outro]
This is Tego Calderón, the abayarde
Together with DJ Joe and Rafy Mercenario
Getting bastard in the microphone
To enjoy it and to retouch
All that 'cat'
That they like my molasses
Zulu arrived like Shaka
What was?
I thought they already knew from Membed
