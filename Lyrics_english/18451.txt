Whoa Oh! (Me vs. Everyone) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I candy coat and cover everything
But I'm still hiding underneath
It's been a long time, it's been a long time

A thousand faces looking up at me
Hands all pointing to the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got friends in highly low places
I'm standing on post and I'm posted up
Can't afford to lose them
I've got friends in highly low places
I'll go inside when I wanna party
Grab a girl and dance (Don't touch me)

[Chorus]
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
Why do I put myself in these situations?
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it, at all

[Verse 2]
Girl, who taught you how to move like that?
At this pace your at, you're going way too fast
I, I saw you from across the room
It's me versus every guy, it's your choice, you choose

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got friends in highly low places
It's been a long time, it's been a long time
And maybe, baby
You can rise above the rest and meet me, yeah

[Chorus]
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
Why do I put myself in these situations?
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it, at all

Why do I put myself in these situations?
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it, at all

[Bridge]
You're worth losing my self esteem
Your clever words mean nothing
More to me, than a line I heard in a movie

You're worth losing my, losing my
Losing my self esteem
You're not worth putting myself
In these situations

[Chorus]
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
Why do I put myself in these situations?
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it, at all

Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
Why do I put myself in these situations?
Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa oh!
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it, at all1Embed
