To Be Honest Lyrics[Intro]
Turn Me Up Josh
Ayo Bleu
Young Cutta, run it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Truth is (Truth is)
Wake up in the night and I think about granny
Truth is (Truth is)
And I love my bitch, I share my addy
Truth is (Truth is)
I got off drugs, I don't feel like an addict
Truth is (Truth is)
I love the streets, they respect my daddy
[Chorus]
And to be honest
And in the streets, we goin' down
And to be honest
And I swear this cash, it turn you sad
And to be honest
And I kept on goin', I kept tryin'
And to be honest
You know I keep on goin', I feel like I'm dyin'

[Verse]
I give you my heart, just know my pain attached
Too deep in bonds when I'm payin' cash
This money counter saved me a lot of hands
You cross me once, can't get another chance
Took the strippers down to San Fran'
I get called, I told his best friends
Half time, my jammer fucked up my damn pants
'Cause you my brother, your friends ain't none of my friends
I told on Trey but he ain't understand
He fell in love with her OnlyFans
The opps so goofy, his friends is only fans
Too high off thirty, that's why I be poppin' tens
My brother got shot, say he won't get shot again
V. Roy been real ever since we locked it in
Paid off my time, it's actually goin' big
They got your statement, I say, "Am I going to see it?"
I knew I was goin' to jail when I lost my hearin'
That shit get too close, then they disappearin'
I text my mama when I woke up to millions
And I kept cheesin' like this life is brilliant
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Truth is (Truth is)
Wake up in the night and I think about granny
Truth is (Truth is)
And I love my bitch, I share my addy
Truth is (Truth is)
I got off drugs, I don't feel like an addict
Truth is (Truth is)
I love the streets, they respect my daddy

[Chorus]
And to be honest
And in the streets, we goin' down
And to be honest
And I swear this cash, it turn you sad
And to be honest
And I kept on goin', I kept tryin'
And to be honest
You know I keep on goin', I feel like I'm dyin'

[Outro]
And to be honest
And to be honest2Embed
