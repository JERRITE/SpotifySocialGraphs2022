TranslationEnglishla Bachata Lyrics [Lyrics for "La Bachata"]

[Verse 1]
I blocked you in Insta, but on the other hand I see your stories (OH-OH-OH)
Your number I deleted it; I don't know what if I know it by heart
You hurt me, and so I miss you
And although I know that one day I'm going to forget you
I still don't do it, it's complicated
To 'what I did' I like to remember

[Chorus]
I'm driving the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not requested
I better ask God to take care of me
Because I manage the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not requested
I better ask God to take care of me, huh
[Verse 2]
That takes care of another that looks like you
I don't want to fall as I did for you
I hope you fell in love, you do the same thing you did to me
You taught me not to love anyone
And also how do I not want them to love me
No-oh-oh, we were three in a two-way relationship
Don't forgive you, ask God forgive
I said that I forgot you and the truth and that I-Oh-Oh
I-Oh-Oh

[Chorus]
I'm driving the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not requested
I better ask God to take care of me
Because I manage the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not requested
I better ask God to take care of me, huh

[Outro]
