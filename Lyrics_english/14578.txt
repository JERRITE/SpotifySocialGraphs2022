Just In Case Lyrics[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Tryna touch ten figures, oh
Lay on my back watching the ceiling fan
I had a dream to touch a kilo gram
I seen your bitch through my Cazal shades
Skull and bones 'til I die, nigga, well paid (Damn)
Got on my khakis out in Tallahassee (Jeez)
Sahari desert and I'm even flashy
Still at odds with the Irish mob
Rolls Royce down Malcom X boulevard
Lord, these niggas really out here preying on me
Got the .40 on me, and it's staying on me
Snow White mink like I'm Dutch Schultz
Run the books and let me show you how the numbers look
You can't be lucky like you Luciano
The kilos come in like they new pianos
Fat boy got the big body
Coast to coast, I could shoot product
They wanna see you up in Alcatraz
Forbes list AWOL and you're falling fast
Fuck this, hell nah, nigga want a bag
Eight figures, count it all and I call a cab
Get the drift, time to get a lift (Uh)
I'm gettin' rich so it's hit or miss (Woo, woo)
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Open up my window again (Yeah)
Open up my window again (Yeah)
I can hear death calling my name (It's calling)
I can hear death calling my name (It's calling)
I swear to God things ain't gon change (Change)
I swear to God things ain't gon change (Change)
I keep a revolver wit' your name (Yeah)
I keep a revolver wit' your name, just in case

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm a hood nigga, I know why they love me
I'm on some underground shit, just like the subway (Uh huh)
Battle niggas in the streets and murder whoever you brought on this fucking stage
I'm the fucking plague, I'm global warming
I'm the Ebola virus, my niggas is pirates
Prepare for violence, silence
How many times you been behind the wall? None
You either snitching or lying about the shit you done
You ain't never move a brick 'less you was building a house
You ain't never put a nigga out with the gun in his mouth
Only thing you ever shot was pool
Only thing you ever cut was class
Y'all niggas is ass (What?) (Woo)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Open up my window again (Yeah)
Open up my window again (Yeah)
I can hear death calling my name (It's calling)
I can hear death calling my name (It's calling)
I swear to God things ain't gon change (Change)
I swear to God things ain't gon change (Change)
I keep a revolver wit' your name (Yeah)
I keep a revolver wit' your name, just in caseYou might also like2Embed
