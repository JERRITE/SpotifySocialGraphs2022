Enhule lyrics ["enhule" letter]]

[Intro]
(My God, what plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-Yeah
I have a plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-Yeah; RA-RAUW)
I do not know what happened
That my mouth liked when a kiss stole you (Yeah)
It was just a game that came out
The rule broke

[Pre-car]
Now your name does not come out
If you want to repeat, I remember where
And, mommy, I fall even loyal '
I despair if I don't see you
[Chorus]
My God, what plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-Yeah
I have a plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-yeah
With you a plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-yeah
I have a plug-chu, yeah (enchule), oh

[Verse 1]
Since the first time I saw you, without thinking I put me pa 'ti
Dreaming awake I undressed you, Yeah (Yeah), ah (I undressed you)
Hi how are things? How's it going?
How good your lipstick color looks
His hip despairs me when walking
I will make her fall in love (oh-oh)

[Pre-car]
Now your name does not come out (Yeah)
If you want to repeat, I remember where
And, mommy, I fall even loyal '
I despair if I don't see you (oh)

[Chorus]
My God, what plug-chu-le-le-e, yeah-yyah (eh)
I have a plug-chu-le-le-e, Yeah-yeah (huh, h!)
With you a plug-le-le-e (an enhule-eh, ey-yeah), Yeah-Yeah (enchule)
I have a plug-chu-le (enchule), Yeah (enchule), oh-oh-yeah!

Turn off the light, tell me what you expect (UH-UH)
Today I eat your blind skin (yih-ih)
In plane mode, the cell does not sound (EY)
Until tomorrow in my bed you stay (Yah!)
Mommy, tell me if you like aggressive (ah!)
Or soft to the navel (UH)
Think about it if you want to 'be just your friend (OH-OH)
