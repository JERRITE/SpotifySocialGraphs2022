TranslationEnglishn5 Lyrics ["N5" letter]

[Verse 1]
Write down, shoot
I put the chest to the 'bullet'
My bitch does not bark
But how the pillow bites (ah)
It has that effect (ah)
It's so perfect (ah)
As we do (ah)
Dirty and direct
[Pre-car]
Ate it (small)
Always hidden
Is that baby is very good
And it fascinates me, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
I love you on top, nothing on top, only Chanel's five
We already broke the platform then the hotel room
One night in love later I will see us
I 'dimo' the cover now damе of eating
I quiro on top, nothing on top, only the five of Chanel
We already broke the platform then the hotel room
One night in love later I will see us
We already gave them the cover, now give me to eat

[Verse 2]
Cane, cane, cane
The thing gets rude
Is perreateing me
And little by little bare
Scandal
The two somo 'a scandal
Everyone is recording us
It tells me "baby, let's go, let's go"
