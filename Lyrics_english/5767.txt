Love Spreads Lyrics[Instrumental Intro 00:00-01:13]

[Verse 1]
Love spreads her arms
Waits there for the nails
I forgive you boy
I will prevail
Too much to take
Some cross to bear
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic
She's over there, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
She didn't scream
She didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy
But don't leave town
Cold black skin
Naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again

[Chorus]
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen

[Post-Chorus]
I have a dream
I've seen the light
Don't put it out, and she's alright
Yeah, she's my sister

She didn't scream
She didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy
But don't leave town
Cold black skin
Naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
