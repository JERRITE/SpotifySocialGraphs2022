Where are we going to see Lyrics [letter from "Where are we going to see ourselves"]

[Chorus]
Where are we going to see ourselves?
Tell me the time and you call me
I have the excuse for seeing you
Today I want to have you and I can't stand the desire
(I better tell you that)
Where are we going to see ourselves?
Tell me the time and you call me (tell me the time and you call me)
I have the excuse to see you (pa 'see you)
Today I want to have you (have you)
And I can't take the desire anymore
[Verse 1]
It's too late.
We can't stay 'with the' win '
It is almost going to dawn
And there is no time to lose
We have to sleep in another bed

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm leaving for your house
Go looking up on the terrace
Vamo 'Let's see what is what happens
Your mouth is a threat
There is what you put on you take away
Give me another kiss if you want to repeat
This is going to be quick, tonight your body visited

[Pre-car]
And you don't love me, and I don't love you
We are nothing just enjoyed, baby
If you love me 'see, I want to see you, what about' to do?
We watched us 'to eat, we will eat' to eat

[Chorus]
Where are we going to see ourselves?
Tell me the time and you call me (tell me the time and you call me)
I have the excuse to see you (pa 'see you)
Today I want to have you and I can't stand the desire
Where are we going to see ourselves?
Tell me the time and you call me (tell me the time and you call me)
I have the excuse to see you (pa 'see you)
Today I want to have you (have you)
And I can't take the desire anymore

And you don't love me, I don't love you
We are nothing just enjoyed, baby
If you love me 'see, I want to see you, what about' to do?
We watched us 'to eat, we will eat' to eat

[Chorus]
Where are we going to see ourselves?
Tell me the time and you call me (tell me the time and you call me)
I have the excuse to see you (pa 'see you)
Today I want to have you (have you)
And I can't take the desire anymore
