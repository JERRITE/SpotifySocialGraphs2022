Something more lyrics ["something else" letter]

[Verse 1]
Your lips speaking every time I like them more
I just observe when passing and your eyes say more
It's not just how you look at me, it's not just how you take it
It is something that you emanas that is natural to you

[Chorus]
It's something else, it's something else
That when I look at you, I fall in love more
It's more than I can't explain to you
But I like it so much
[Verse 2]
I can't find the words
To tell you this what happens to me
Because I want to show you
Look in the eye and not let you breathe

[Chorus]
It's something else, it's something else
That when I look at you, I fall in love more
It's more than I can't explain to you
But I like it so much

[Bridge]
This complicity between the two
Could it be that I only see it?
Can this idea be made something real?

[Chorus]
It's something else, it's something else
That when I look at you, I fall in love more
It's more than I can't explain to you
But I like it so much

[Post-car]
It's something else, it's something else
That when I look at you, I fall in love more
It's more than I can't explain to you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Ohyou Might Also Likeembed
