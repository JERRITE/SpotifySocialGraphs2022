Poison Petals Lyrics[Verse 1]
There ain't a lack of the chemistry
I'm really fucking with all of your energy
Highly pursued but I don't let it get to me
They said the start of us might be the end of me
I don't read minds, but I see signs
Johnny and June and we walking the line
Remember you best with a streak of some blonde for the spring
I gotta hella respect for you doing your thing
Couple of drinks we get drunk off the drama you mad
Passive aggressive a hook and a jab
I gotta fix it whenever you sad
Baby I'm doing the best that I can
You know I gotta make good on the vision
I can explain if you're willing to listen
Girl I've been with it since whipping the civic
So sit down a second and give me a minute
[Chorus]
Baby if you love me let me know
Let me know, let me know
Baby if you love me let it show
Let it show, let it show
From the tippy top to the bottom of your soul
Peace and love and happiness are all that we should know
This the conversation that I always leave alone
Poison dripping from the petals of a rose

[Verse 2]
You say love me whenever you miss it
We fight and make up like it's family tradition
You get what you give I thought that was a given
The taste in my mouth like a spoonful of cinnamon
Gave you the benefit of doubt from the start
Light up your world when you stuck in the dark
Love it is evil now I need a needle and stitches to patch up the hole in your heart
Couple of hits we get high off love and it's pure
Examine your body and all of its curves
Wrapping you up like I'm laying a verse
I'm in your city on enemy turf
You say you love me you want me to stay
Taking your shots and you fire away
Guess it depends on the time of the day
Tell me whatever you're trying to say
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby if you love me let me know
Let me know, let me know
Baby if you love me let it show
Let it show, let it show
From the tippy top to the bottom of your soul
Peace and love and happiness are all that we should know
This the conversation that I always leave alone
Poison dripping from the petals of a rose2Embed
