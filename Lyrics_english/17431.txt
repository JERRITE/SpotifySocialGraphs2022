Face Up To The Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm running wild
To the unknown, but I can't go without, without you
So don't be blind
Escape the ordinary and don't be shy, don't be shy

[Chorus]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, on and on and on
You got to keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run
[Pre-Drop]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

[Drop]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, on and on and on
You got to keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

[Verse 2]
Crossing lines
Be unstoppable, keep reachin' for those heights, those heights
Oh, worth your while
Nothing to lose, we hold on tight, hold on tight

[Chorus]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, on and on and on
You got to keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

[Bridge]
(We're always on the run, always on the run)

[Pre-Drop]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, on and on and on
You got to keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

[Outro]
Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the runEmbed
