My first million lyrics [lyrics by "my first million"]

[Intro]
I just want to hit the radio
I just want to hit the radio

[Verse 1]
I'm already tired of being indebted
To see you suffering for every penny
Let's leave everything and let's go for Miami
I'm going to what I'm going to make myself famous
To artist's life, to live on songs
Sell ​​illusions that break ten thousand hearts
[Chorus]
I just want to hit the radio
To win my first million
To buy you a big house
Where your heart
I just want people to sing
Everywhere this song
From San Juan to Barranquilla
From Seville to New York

[Bridge]
I repeat that
They will listen to me
On the radio on television
And so it will be my first million

[Verse 2]
We barely arrive, we call Emilio
I have a friend, friend of a friend
With a direct line to the sky of so many stars
Then we will walk from here to there
With Paulina Rubio and Alejandro Sanz
Quiet dear, Paulina is just a friend

[Chorus]
I just want to hit the radio
To win my first million
To buy you a big house
Where your heart
I just want people to sing
Everywhere this song
From Kabul to Curaçao
From Callao to Panama

I just want to hit the radio
To win my first million
To buy you a big house
Where your heart
I just want people to sing
Everywhere this song
From Guayaquil to Santo Domingo
From Tijuana to Salvador

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Wow them in front or wipe it there
That is in front of them, throw pa 'in front
He is in front of him and throws pa 'in front
I already want to get out of this bicycle
Go out without thinking about the account
Buy an Oscar de la Renta dress
Quiet that my first million comes there
And as I say
I just want to hit the radio
I just want to hit the radio
I just want to hit the radio
I just want to hit the radio
[Chorus]
I just want to hit the radio
To win my first million
To buy you a big house
Where your heart
I just want people to sing
Everywhere this song
From San Juan to Barranquilla
From Madrid to New York

[Outro]
I just want to hit the radio
To win my first million
To buy you a big house
Where your heart is
