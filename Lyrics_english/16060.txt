Celebrate You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mary, Mary, I know you've been feelin' down
Mary, Mary, when you gonna figure out
Mary, Mary, you ain't ordinary
Everybody sees it, Mary, Mary

[Pre-Chorus]
Just believe it, uh-huh (It's all in your head)
The night is still young (It ain't over yet)
Meet me outside (You know the address)
I'll make sure that you don't forget
[Chorus]
Everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
'Cause everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hеll
I celebrate you

[Verse 2]
Mary, Mary, I'll bе with you through the pain
Mary, Mary, I know that you'd do the same
Mary, Mary, you ain't ordinary
Everybody sees it, Mary, Mary

[Chorus]
Everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
'Cause everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I celebrate you
I celebrate you
I scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
I celebrate you
I celebrate you
I scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe it, uh-huh (It's all in your head)
The night is still young (It ain't over yet)
Meet me outside (You know the address)
I'll make sure that you don't forget

[Chorus]
Everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
'Cause everything I like about myself
Is better with you
Scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
[Outro]
I celebrate you
I celebrate you
I scream it to the world like what the hell
I celebrate you
