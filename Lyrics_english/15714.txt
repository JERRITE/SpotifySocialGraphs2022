Get me to love Lyrics [verse 1]
Love me again
I just ask for time to speak
Lie by pride is not right
We swore not to give up without fighting
Love me again
Don't want to hide the truth
Hurting for love is never losing
And to love is to be able with the truth

[Pre-car]
Love me again
I only promise to give you love
Inside you know that it is not right
I swear that you are better
[Chorus]
Love me again
There are still a thousand songs to sing
We have many things to learn
Life will teach us to fly
Love me again
Understand that I know how to apologize
Forgive me that everything will be fine
And I'm going to heal your heart

[Verse 2]
Love me again
If I cry is not because of the fault, it's for love
I was blind but I can see it
What to love never rhymes with pain
Love me again
I only promise to give you love
Inside you know that it is not right
I swear that you are better

[Chorus]
Love me again
There are still a thousand songs to sing
We have many things to learn
Life will teach us to fly
Love me again
Understand that I know how to apologize
Forgive me that everything will be fine
And I'm going to heal your heart
