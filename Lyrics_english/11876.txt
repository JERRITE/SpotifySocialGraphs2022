I already forgave you Lyrics [lyrics by "I already forgave you"]

[Verse 1: Makis, Juliana]
I know you haven't been well, no
That the past is your enemy
And at night you always dream
With what was not
And now that the fault won luck
You realize that time returns it
Today after so long I can see
I'm always going to love you
[Chorus: Camila]
And even if you never asked me, I'm fine
And although I never told you before, I missed you
You were you who decided to get away, why it is no longer so important
And although you never asked for it, I already forgave you
And although you never asked for it, I already forgave you

[Verse 2: Olga]
Never before was silence so enough
Never before a hug felt so strong

[Chorus: Natalia]
And even if you never asked me, I'm fine
And although I never told you before, I missed you
You were you who decided to get away, why it is no longer so important
And although you never asked for it, I already forgave you

[Bridge: Makis, Olga]
So many nights that I tried to forget you
And even if I can't hate you
No longer matters what it was
I'm always going to love you

[Chorus: Juliana]
And even if you never asked me, I'm fine
And although I never told you before, I missed you
You were you who decided to get away, why it is no longer so important
And although you never asked for it, I already forgave you
And although you never asked for it, you already forgaveyou miGht Also Likeembed
