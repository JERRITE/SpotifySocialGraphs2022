Tell me if you remember lyrics [chorus]
A question tonight I ask you
Don't bother, you just listen to please be vague
Just tell me if you remember all those days
When walking with me was the best way
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me, just tell me

[See 1]
Just tell me if you remember when I was your fire
Remember to take you out of the house of servitude
Just tell me because in you it was already customary
Hide from me, although my grace enters
Now answer me, don't go to alluded to me
You can't forget what I have lived with me
I know that you have fallen and has suffered a lot
But I'm still waiting for you to become repentant
Is that you are proud and
You can not understand me
After so much time you have not come to meet me
I know you have not to be able to please me
But I just ask you to believe me
When I say I love you and you can't see the width
The depth and height, I love you madly
There is no sting of death
Nor burial power
Look for me in intimacy you know there is no censorship
[Chorus]
A question tonight I ask you
Don't bother, you just listen to please be vague
Just tell me if you remember all those days
When walking with me was the best way
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me if you remember
Just tell me, just tell me

[See 2]
I want you to remember it, because you forgot it
Like everything you deleted, you discarded everything
What I do is not for you to live in your memory
But so that today you live in glory in glory
Glory - for you have pending
That my power is perfect, in what the devil tempts you
Open your eyes son, I want to clarify your mind
Understand me that I jealously long for you
I am not a man to hurt you for your mistakes
I am the God what does things better
Relive passions and live without fears
That with my right I will heal your pains
Now approach me
Decide to return
You won't believe what with you can I do
Because even if you think you died
And that there is no way out
Remember, "I am the resurrection and life"

Just tell me, just tell membed
