Body Pump (Lady Bee Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm bad up on the weekend
Not sitting up on my own
I've been hiding from you too long now
So you don't know
You think you're tough, you didn't want to know
Living in your prison, you wouldn't let it go
The strength of your illusion is getting real low
Baby, look around, look around now
('Round now)
(Now)
[Drop]
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for something like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resist
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for something like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resist

[Chorus]
Don't tell me to think about it (Won't stop me)
Don't tell me to think about it (Don't make me lose my way)
'Cause I've been hearing enough about it (Won't stop me)
Yeah, I've been hearing enough about it (Don't make me lose my way)

[Verse 2]
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for something like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resist
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for somеthing like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resist

Don't tell mе to think about it (Won't stop me)
Don't tell me to think about it (Don't make me lose my way)
'Cause I've been hearing enough about it (Won't stop me)
Yeah, I've been hearing enough about it (Don't make me lose my way)

[Drop]
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for something like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resist
Hold on
My body's pumping all night long
I've been waiting for something like this
Body's pumping, I just can't resistEmbed
