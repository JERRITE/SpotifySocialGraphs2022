What's up Doc
Wascally Wabbit

Ay, ay, ay
Woah... let's go

[Chorus]
I rap on the shitter they wanna be with it cause everyone know I'm the littest
I pull up with bitches cause I be the biggest and trust that it's making a difference
My homies are chillers, original killers, and we're representing the riches (Okurr)
I'm switching so groovy, making a movie, we be looney toonin

[Verse 1]
You cannot confuse it, Hades with new shit, babies love all of my music
I stay in my lane like I go for the lay up, I'm mixing you up like a Rubiks (Oh woah)
Pull up in Mercedes with three of my ladies, I'm passing it over to my guy (Skrrrrr)
We trapping it up, booty clapping it up, gotta get this function on rewind (One time)
Yo bitch tryna grab the remote, but I scene select right to her behind
We back to the fax, she throwing it back gotta give her this d she refine (Facts!)
Dress her up in designer, we fly to Bahamas on a jet airliner like she fly (No cappin)
I'm wrapping it up on these bitches who Dm'ing me in the sky while I recline
Really out here she ain't seen shit! I could fuck it up in a minute because I'm lit
Ima just keep on going skitz! Baddies on my body they trying to do the splits
Ima just run it back like I'm a Running back call me the G.O.A.T like I'm Marshawn Lynch (Run it back, Running back, goat, woo)
You already know that I been going all in since the dawn, thats real shit (Let's go)

[Chorus]
I rap on the shitter they wanna be with it cause everyone know I'm the littest (Yeah)
I pull up with bitches cause I be the biggest and trust that it's making a difference (Making a difference Oh shit)
My homies are chillers, original killers, and we're representing the riches
(Chillers, yup, killers, riches, yo)
I'm switching so groovy, making a movie, we be looney toonin
(We be Looney Toonin, yo)

[Verse 2]
Running it down to count up the digits, I need you to find me the bitches
(Running it down)
And if there's a limit I'm stacking the film and I'm jacking it
I gotta capture my image but maybe we'll split it (Click click)
Fuck is you talking bout? I make decisions but you couldn't get it
Never mind, telling time, always selling rhymes ever since the Kid was a midget
My money taller now, my shit is all around, blessings they falling now, I get to call it now
Shots they balling now, nigga you stalling (Shots)
How couldn't you tell me that you was the G.O.A.T (How)
Y'all niggas wasn't tryna peep the focus, had to divide it on top of the quotient
Wet up the dryer and get him some lotion, ah (Ooh)
What is you smoking (Gas)
Dippin and dive in the liquor I spit up the potion (Ptooey)
Level up until I get my promotion
School in session and the classes is open, master the joking, so you can quote him
Shit is just black, blacker than gold, flipping the bars it'll earn you my token, woah

I'm switching so groovy, making a movie, we be looney toonin

I rap on the shitter they wanna be with it cause everyone know I'm the littest (Ay)
I pull up with bitches cause I be the biggest and trust that it's making a difference
