Black Flag Army Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've spent our lives left out in the rain
As you stand dry behind the window pane
Don’t try to understand us, you have no clue (Clue)
So I took a bat and I broke the glass
You're exclusive but you have no class
Never been first, but we're built to last
We’re not afraid of you
Born to make you uncomfortable
Our hate is unconditional
Coexistence is impossible
And we're coming for you
[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Verse 2]
You spent your life sheltered in the shade
We stood in the ruins as the fires blazed
You tried to dull our shine but we refused
So I took a knife and I made the cut
Million dollar smile that you can't stitch up
You're the diamonds and we're the rust
Choke you with your silver spoon
We’re caustic and we’re flammable
We're feral motherfucking animals
Our fists are up, we’re unstoppable
And we've got a gift for you

[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I’ll lean back on you

[Post-Chorus]
Raise your black flag and terrorize
Raise your black flag, no compromise
Raise your black flag, we're under siege
Raise your black flag and stand together with me
You might also like[Bridge]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Chorus]
We're the black flag army, the militia of truth
Raise your black flag, pledge allegiance to our roots
We're the black flag army, demolition crew
You just lean on me, and I'll lean back on you

[Post-Chorus]
Raise your black flag and terrorize
Raise your black flag, no compromise
Raise your black flag, we're under siege
Raise your black flag and stand together with meEmbed
