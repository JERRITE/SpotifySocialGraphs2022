California (Chris Lake & Matroda Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Kaleena Zanders]
California
California
In the city

[Chorus: Kaleena Zanders]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city, a good ol' house
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin’, we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin’
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin’
We keep it rockin’, we keep it rockin'
[Drop: Chris Lake & Matroda]

[Post-Chorus: Kaleena Zanders]

[Chorus: Kaleena Zanders]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city, a good ol’ house
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin’
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin', we keep it
