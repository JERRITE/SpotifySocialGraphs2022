Lyrics is walked [letter from "Menea"]

[Intro: Nio García & Don Omar]
XOUND MUSIC
You came here (D, D)
For the same as me (OH-OH)
It's Saturday and leave '(Don!)
He says he was given (eh)
And that today does not care na '(the king!)

[Chorus: Don Omar & Nio García]
And he wiggles for me to see her
He kissed me, but turns
He left me with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
He likes the 'greatest', that goes to my bed (D, D, D, D, D, D)
And he wiggles for me to see her
He sticks to kiss me, but he turns
Mе left with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
Even here I am less, she leaves my bed
[Verse 1: Don Omar]
Baby, he 'turns back' behind you
I crazy about catching you, you na 'de na'
Ask for another bottle, Vámono 'from here
Let yourself take, I know where to go
Under the moon, in front of the sea I felt your frenzy
And think that dancing I met you
Baby, give me one night, tell me that yes
Let 'and quote you, it's not' like this

[Pre-Caro: Nio García & Don Omar]
For you I wad, I looked for a job
I had a baby, I sent it to the fuck
Is that she has wrapped me, she does not want owner
I saw his ass and brought me who brought me (the king!)
Baby, for you I wad, I'm going down
If they get gross', I work them myself
Chulita, has no owner, has me wrapped
I saw that and took me who brought me

[Chorus: Nio García & Don Omar]
If you see her 'how she wiggles for me to see her
He sticks to kiss me, but he turns
He left me with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
Even if I am minor, she leaves my bed (Don!)
And he wiggles for me to see her
He kissed me, but turns
He left me with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
He likes the 'greatest', that goes for my bed

And she doesn't believe in mooring ', let go of the drawer
He kisses me 'so sweet, he already gave me diabet'
I want to be a plane and you my airport
Pa 'I travel the world, land on your body

[Pre-Caro: Nio García & Don Omar]
For you I wad, I looked for a job
I had a baby, I sent it to the fuck
Is that she has wrapped me, she does not want owner
I saw his ass and took me who brought me
Baby, for you I wad, I'm going down
If they get gross', I work them myself
Chulita, has no owner, has me wrapped
I saw that and took me who brought me

[Chorus: Nio García & Don Omar]
If you see her 'how she wiggles for me to see her
He sticks to kiss me, but he turns
He left me with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
Even if I am minor, she leaves my bed (the king!)
And he wiggles for me to see her
He kissed me, but turns
He left me with the 'wins', but he doesn't beat me
[He likes the 'greatest', that goes for my bed]
[Outro: Don Omar]
