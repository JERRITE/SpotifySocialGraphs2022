[Chorus: Cazzu]
We are mockery (yuh)
I put it hot to the winter, get out for
Everyone shouts: "Cazzu President", the party explodes, Yaoh (Yaoh)
YOUR GIRL TO ME LA'O, YAOH (YAOH, YAOH)
Give him, mommy, move it like that, break it there-í
We are mockery (we go mockery)
Winter put it hot, get out of the
Everyone shouts: "Cazzu President", the party explodes, Yaoh (Yaoh)
YOUR BOY TO ME LA'O, YAOH (YAOH, YAOH)
Give it, daddy, move it like this (uh), break it there-í
[Verse: Cazzu]
I have the eggs' that you do not have and never had
I have a full account 'and you are a hole
He says that he is on the street and on the street they never saw him
That my former question all day for me, they told me, Yah
'Tá to' gucci, 'tá to nice
'Tamo' up, 'tamo' high
'Tamo' living life to pure flow miami vice
Rapper Fake, your chain fake
To 'what they presume fake
The only expensive car you bought it in GTA, ey, ey
Uh, for, Byza, they are calling me, mmm (grr)
Don't call me I'm not, don't ask if I'm going
I'm already tired of such shit
I have my head destroyed, I don't know who I am
Tremendous style, I make it lost
You're going to remember my voice, you're going to hit me a call
Baby, there is no chance to attend you
The Byza featuring the boss, the street asked for it
And now take to learn, ha (eh)

[Chorus: Cazzu]
That we are mockery (yuh)
I put it hot to the winter, get out for
All shout: "Cazzu President", the party explodes'o, Yaoh
YOUR GIRL TO ME LA'O, YAOH
Give him, mommy, move it like that, break it there-í
We are mockery (we go mockery)
Winter put it hot, get out of the
All shout: "Cazzu President", the party explodes'o, Yaoh
YOUR BOY TO ME LA'O, YAOH
Give him, daddy, move it like that, break it there-í (-í)
