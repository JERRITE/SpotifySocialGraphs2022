Lovers On The Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby, baby
The way you shinin' lately
Is brighter than the stars in the sky
Elevated
Is it too soon to say that
I'm yours if you're along for the ride?

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so high in this place
In your eyes, I been floatin'
Feels just like outer space
No one else, just me and you
[Chorus]
I wanna love you 'til your feet don't touch the ground
I wanna know you where the air don't make a sound
I feel so high when I'm with you, ooh
We could be lovers on the moon
I never knew that I could feel like this, oh no
I never knew until my heart crashed into yours
I feel so high when I'm with you, ooh
We could be lovers on the moon

[Post-Chorus]
We could be lovers on the moon
So high

[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby, baby
The way that you've been tastin'
I could eat it up all night
And when it's over, if I lose my composure
It's only 'cause you're blowin' my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so high in this place
Feels just like I've been floating in your eyes
Outer space, no one else, just me and you
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna love you 'til your feet don't touch the ground
I wanna know you where the air don't make a sound
I feel so high when I'm with you, ooh
We could be lovers on the moon
I never knew that I could feel like this, oh no
I never knew until my heart crashed into yours
I feel so high when I'm with you, ooh
We could be lovers on the moon

[Post-Chorus]
We could be lovers on the moon
So high
We could be lovers on the moon
So high

[Bridge]
Ooh, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, I la-la-la like it
Ooh, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, I la-la-la like it

[Chorus]
I wanna love you 'til your feet don't touch the ground
I wanna know you where the air don't make a sound
I feel so high when I'm with you, ooh
We could be lovers on the moon
[Post-Chorus]
We could be lovers on the moon
So high
We could be lovers on the moon
So highEmbed
