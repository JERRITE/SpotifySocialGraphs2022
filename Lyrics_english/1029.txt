Tell Me That You Love Me Lyrics[Intro: Leon Thomas III,  w/ Victoria Justice]
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
The situation turned around enough to figure out
That someone else has let you down
So many times I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Justice]
But I know we can make it
As long as you say it
[Chorus: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
So tell me that you love me, yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then, I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
So tell me that you love me anyway
Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
Waking up beside yourself and what you feel inside
Is being shared with someone else
Nowhere to hide, I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Justice]
But I know we can make it
As long as you say it

[Chorus: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
So tell me that you love me, yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then, I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
But tell me that you love me anyway

Show me, look what we found
It's turning around everyday
I can hear what you say
Now, I know why, I know we can make it

[Chorus: Victoria Justice,  w/ Leon Thomas III]
If you tell me that you love me, yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
So tell me that you love me, yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more
Then, I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
But tell me that you love me anyway2Embed
