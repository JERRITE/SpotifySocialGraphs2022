Man or a Monster Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you close your eyes, what do you see?
Do you hold the light, or is darkness underneath?
In your hands, there's a touch that can heal
But in those same hands, is the power to kill

[Chorus]
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
When you look at yourself
Are you a man, or a monster?
[Verse 2]
It's so hard to tell which side you're on
One day is Hell, the next day is the dawn
The lines are blurred, you keep rubbing your eyes
The tables turn, now it's time to survive

[Chorus]
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
When you look at yourself
Are you a man, or a monster?

[Bridge]
You can't take back the damage you've done
Oh, you can hide, but you can't run
No, you can't take back the damage you've done
Afraid of what you might become
A man or a monster
A man or a monster
Ohhhhh

[Chorus]
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
Are you a man, or a monster?
When you look at yourself
Are you a man, or a monster?You might also like1Embed
