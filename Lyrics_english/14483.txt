Trakatá Lyrics ["Trakatá" letter]]

[Intro: Ptazeta]
With the boom-boom of the fine girl
Open to the show, play the horn
OKEY, Slow climb, get on top
With that movement float on stage

[Pre-stribe: Ptazeta]
I get rid and that I downloaded, go down, ba-baje
That baby is wild-save, ba-baje
You want to go on a trip, trip, ba-baje
Come, look what I brought, suit, tra-trap
Colored pills', flowers and power
I had 'to the After Hour
You want 'the moon and I left you Mars
Pa 'study your body, ma', you have to go in parts, hmm
[Chorus: Ptazeta, Farina]
Trakatá, trakatá that baby wants
Trakatá, Trakatá, you want '
Trakatá, Trakatá, if he looks at us' does
Takata, taka—, hmm, ah
Trakatá, trakatá that baby wants
Trakatá, Trakatá, you want '
Trakatá, Trakatá, if he looked at us' does (I, Dale)
Takata, taka—, hmm, ah

[Verse 1: Farina]
Pa 'Las Natural' and the Opeá's
Pa 'those who like to be rapture' (ah)
A flow that breaks all Guinness records (all)
Placata for your camp, placata for which you think
I have the delivery that they are putting into practice
Nor put you on a diet will make you reach this cat
Release the 'pa' tickets see if I give you the cookie '
They believe they have it, but they really have no na '
If you passed, you are discharged
I am possessed, I have a spirit 'and boss
If you are not getting, then you are not going 'A proba'
Since I arrived I put these people disapproba '

[Chorus: Farina & Ptazeta]
Trakatá, trakatá that baby wants
Trakatá, Trakatá, you want '
Trakatá, Trakatá, if you look at it
Takata, taka—, hmm, ah
Trakatá, trakatá that baby wants
Trakatá, Trakatá, you want '
Trakatá, Trakatá, if he looked at us' does (I)
Takata, taka—, hmm, ah

Takata and Hmm, tra—, hot
I want the independent girls to move '
Return and Bum, Jah, straight ahead
Ma ', I imagine you in twenty' different 'pose
And come that we saw 'all-in, I see you with swing
The Connect from the Canary Islands to Medellín
I don't know who you are, but today I don't let her sleep
I haven't tried it yet, and I know it's about to repeat

[Pre-stribe: Ptazeta]
I get rid and that I downloaded, go down, ba-baje
That baby is wild-save, ba-baje
You want to go on a trip, trip, ba-baje
Come, look what I brought, suit, tra-trap, hmm

[Chorus: Ptazeta & Farina]
Trakatá, trakatá that baby wants

Trakatá, Trakatá, you want '
Trakatá, Trakatá, if you look at it
Takata, Taka—, Hmm, AH (Cu-CU)

With Ptazeta in the crazy house
Hey, Jua-Cko, Oh
With Farina, the fine girl from Medellín
I am Farinaembed
