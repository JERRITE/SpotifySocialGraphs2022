Bad of Love Lyrics [Chorus: Ellen Ol√©ria & Lino Krizz] 
 I warned you 
 But I didn't want to hear me 
 Let me die 
 An hour like this 
 I will be reborn 
 Like me more 
 Suffering is of law 
 Everything has an end 

 Not to die of an evil of love 
 Another day, a new love 
 To heal me 
 [Verse: Mano Brown] 
 Violent is love 
 Today I ask for peace 
 Now who doesn't want me, no 
 I do not want anymore 
 Home 
 Nothing that was will be 
 Because everything goes 
 Everything will pass 
 Who took the worst I was 
 One day we were one 
 I thought 
 What crazy game is love 
 Who loves comes out loser 
 In the underworld where I am 
 Can man, I'll be back 
 (I need to smoke) 
 (Evil of love, evil of love)
