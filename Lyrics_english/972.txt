Lyrics set me ["I noticed"]

[Intro: Rauw Alejandro & Alex Rose]
UH-YEAH-YEAH
Alex Rose
OH-YEAH-YEAH
Ra-Rauw

[Pre-Caro: Rauw Alejandro & Alex Rose]
People are already crazy
But nobody wants to go
They do not go down to the note
But I just love you
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Alex Rose]
You don't know, that in you I looked
Although he doesn't know us ', with you I already have one' plans
I know the taste of the Moët
But my lips ask what your little mouth knows
I detail from her there is one 'stop'
But none with me leaves
Later I will say: "You saw, I told you"
But for now

[Verse 1: Alex Rose]
For now you are looking at me
Here in mine, machineing, imagining that
If what I am thinking about
It may be that I never was wrong
You don't know me ', but I knew you (mmm)
Pa 'ti I have a moët, release the bleeding
I know he doesn't have 'owner, but today he is going to be mine
If you want to 'stay tonight even if you leave' 'and day

[Bridge: Alex Rose]
Mmm, look at it well
Dancing alone until I approach and get ahead
Yeah, I know that the world saw me, I don't care about people
And is that

You don't know ', that in you I noticed
And although he doesn't know us ', with you I already have planet'
I know the taste of the Moët
But my lips ask what your little mouth knows
I detail from her there is one 'stop'
But with me none comes out
Later I will say: "You saw, I told you"
But for now (RA-RAUW)

[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
Imagine burning in the Jacuzzi (Yih-Ih)
I get horny with the Tussi (Yah!)
Your pussy has to be good juicy (Wuh-Uh)
Dj, I still don't change the music (ha!)
That I want
See it with the 'buttock' above (Wuh) and the 'hand' to the ground
I have you close and I despair (ey)
Celebrating ', signing a homemade, Oh-Yeah (Wuh!)
That I want
See it with the 'buttock' above and the 'hand' to the ground (OH-OH)
I'm crazy because it takes the hook
That I am going to eat it whole, OH-YEAH (YAH!)

[Pre-Caro: Alex Rose & Rauw Alejandro]
Already the people 'tá crazy
But nobody wants to go from here
They do not go down to the note
But I just love you
[Coro: Alex Rose & Rauw Alejandro, both]
You don't know ', that in you I noticed
And although he doesn't know us ', with you I already have planet'
I know the taste of the Moët
But my lips ask what your little mouth knows
I detail from her there is one 'stop'
But with me none comes out
Later I will say: "You saw, I told you"
But for now
