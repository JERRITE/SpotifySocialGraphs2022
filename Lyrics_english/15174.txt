Catamaran LyricsGot your bones spread out on the dance floor chomping
Bits on your way to the supermarket
Well respected, well received, piano and the luggage
Own the reason, that we all are faking it
Scene two, got an itchy feeling pets are trapped in
Give the voice a document to
Photograph those still life images

You can't make me talk
Fire couldn't make me talk
Is any, is any, is any
You can't make me talk
Fire couldn't make me talk
They came in, they came in
Through the window

I waited around for this clock for these dirty words
Take hold of my tongue, when you're pressing it down
Against the floor of my mouth
There's a pulse in every drop of history
Space is allotted for the questioner
At small things, the smallest things that could ever be stolen
Briefcases hold a piece of this a
Broken arm, a ratchet hand
Move right to the bushes with a light bulb overhead
With a light bulb overhead
You need to move right to the bushes with a light bulb overhead
With a light bulb overhead

You can't make me talk
Fire couldn't make me talk
Is any, is any, is any

You can't make me talk
Fire couldn't make me talk
They came in, they came in
Through the window

You need to b-b-b-b-bury your knife
Bury your knife
