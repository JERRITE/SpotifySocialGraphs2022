The soul that brought you lyrics [intro: ark]
Safety Trance
Ark
P'arriba, P'abajo
And I go up, and bass
P'abajo, I stop, how nice

[Verse: ark]
Give me that soul that brought you
This is a relaxation
Daddy, give me penis, I open it to my claws
You tell me slut
You go up and tear me
While you grab me
I get good corduroy
Cheap panties
You make your slit that I know you love it
Since there are plenty
With advantage, daddy, give me enjoy
[Chorus: Ark]
I am a bitch, but I do you
Miau, Miau, Miau
I let you get out-pao-pao
What a scare, what a relaxation-hay
The soul that brought you (hey)
I do Miau, Miau, Miau
I let you get out-pao-pao
What a scare, what a relaxation-hay
The soul that brought you

[Bridge: ark]
Spring, splashes, gets wet, it chops me
Spring, splashes, gets wet, it chops me
The very rich chicha
Thickness, I splash (hard)
Spring, splashes, gets wet, it chops me
Spring, splashes, gets wet, it chops me
Psycho-psychopathic

[Verse: ark]
Give me that soul that brought you
This is a relaxation
Daddy, give me penis, I open it to my claws
You tell me slut
You go up and tear me
While you grab me
I get good corduroy
Cheap panties
You make your slit that I know you love it
Since there are plenty
With advantage, daddy, give me enjoy
