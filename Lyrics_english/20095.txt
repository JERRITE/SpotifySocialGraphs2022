TranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisAll Dogs Go to Heaven Lyrics[Intro]
Waitin' for Nick to take my motherfuckin' vocals down
Learn to respect a God damn king! If you are too⁠—
Ha, ha, ha, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Yung Christ & Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard]
Leave 'em all burning, triple six degrees (Yeah, yeah)
Heard they started hating, wanna murder thee (Murder thee)
Yung Christ turned to Satan, bless the devilish (Yeah, yeah)
Nowadays I get my joy from fucking chasing death (Yeah, yeah)
Mama raised a savage, knew I wasn't average (I wasn't)
Pops seen me coming up, he knew I had the package (Knew I had the package)
Let the 40 kick, drum roll with the sticks (Pum-pum)
Hands will fuck your jaw, know who you fucking with (Woah, woah)
Get the copper, pop a chopper, Dalai Lama (Dalai Lama)
Feel like Silkk the Shocker, I'm a fucking problem (Fucking problem)
Streets call me doctor, screw them then I chop 'em (Kyoom, kyoom)
Two cups, bottle filled with drugs, liver on the rotten (Ah, ah, ah)
Ruger, chopper, Draco, cult around me Waco, yeah
Violence getting louder, projects getting wilder, yeah (Yeah)
When I'm off a Xan I'm quick to shoot the thang (Thang, thang)
Ain't a clock to see, ain't no time for a game (Game, game)
Fuck 'em all, shoot 'em, leave them in the yard (Rah, rah)
Got a bunch of youngins 'round me, take the charge (Rah, rah)
Fuck 'em all, shoot them, leave them in the yard (Yeah, yeah)
Got a bunch of youngins around me, take the charge, ayy (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard]
Yeah, we all the same but we're separated by commas (Beep)
Yeah, we all the same until we're all destroyed by comets (Hahaha)
Alien invasion, better run home to your mama (Better run)
Ruby ain't the problem solver, I'm the cause of all your problems
Bitch, I'm in Nevada, ayy, 51's, I got 'em
Snorting blue sand with my cosmic ensemble
I don't give a fuck if they're pressed, I still bought 'em (Yeah)
Falling down like autumn, call him duck boy, watch him waddle
Full throttle when I empty out the bottle (Out the bottle)
When I empty out this clip that's full of fucking hollows (Full of hollows)
You'll be lying horizontal, looking like a model (Ayy)
Scope is never toggled, I was aiming for your nostril
Now, I'm aiming at your bitch's tonsil, I'm the queen of drama (Yeah)
Fucking up your life? Yeah, all you gotta do is holler (Holler)
You wanna talk drip? Catch me in the fuckin' sauna (Sauna)
Spent a couple dollars just to make a couple dollars
All these bitches say my name as if it's something like the gospel (Ruby)
All these hoes apostles looking like they wanna gobble (Ack)
Looking at me crazy like they've all been wearing goggles (Fuck you lookin' at?)
Po' me up a fo', I'm looking like a fucking waffle, feeling fucking awfulYou might also like25Embed
