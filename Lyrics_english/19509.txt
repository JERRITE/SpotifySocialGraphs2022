Gold Coast Lyrics[Intro]
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good

Yeah, Good
I just took like 14 adderall, drank 72 red bulls
Finished my intro the day of the release
[Verse 1]
I chase bad bitches, accolades
Got will son, no Castaway
I'm twice as good, get half the praise
Throw a sniper up and I blast away
You ain't getting through me, nah
Tim Howard been here 10 hours
My chick sour, risin' and fallin' together though like we the Twin Towers
Nothin's takin' I'm frustrated
If I could only get just to blaze it
Ain't no doubt that I'd muster greatness
No chip off of that old block
All eyes on me but I'm no pac
Fully loaded off gold shots
That bass'll knock you like cold clocks
I'm number one
Big Mac'in my flow the ice that my wrist lackin', I been happenin', they been slackin'
They been doubtin' I been 'bout it, my mojo back, Raps gold remember
Boutta be one cold winter, got the game on my ring finger
I'm VA and that's overhaul
Been killin' shit cause that's protocol

[Bridge]
I don't do this for y'all
Nah I just do this for me
I flipped the game on its head
180 degrees
Baby please, baby please
I know you're dying to stay
I ain't gon' stop you from walkin'
Always remember the name

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'ma get it cause I can, cause I can, cause I can
In my fitted in my vans, in my vans, in my vans
I think baby girl a fan, she a fan, she a fan (she a fan, she a fan)

[Post-Hook]
I'm highly touted from the valley to the mountains
I ain't finished till I coordinate a car with my outfit
Came to steal your thunder like Miami in the summer man
I'm just getting over all the pressure I was under, down

[Bridge 2]
Cool cat, know I had to go the whole 9
Told you I was golden as corona's on the coastline
These days, I don't know what's worthy of a co-sign
Ain't a 49er I'm just sitting on a gold mine

[Verse 2]
Let it burn like the tropics
All my pockets crave is profit
I'm obnoxious to a nuisance rocking J's out here hoopin'
Hidden in my hoodie from the haters, fuck the drama
I was sent to show the world they're dealing with a problem
From the get-go, let's go
Ready for the next show
Finding time for anything but anytime to rest so
I get it in the morning til' the sun fall back
Then hit it til' it rises an I don't call back
Wa-sushi wasabe sake sippin’ tipsin’ topsy turvy t’isn’t 22 ta- ta- ta-riffic fuck the limit
In a tizzy t-t-totally chillin’
This room’s totally spinnin’
Damn that tab is revealin’
My credit’s headed the ceilin’
And baby girl hit floor, be out here drankin' til 4
When it's raining it pours, oh yeah I done this before
I just thought you should know, I plan on taking you home
No way I'm leaving alone, plus you remind me of Sloan
Drinkin' since 7, thought you walked in with a twin
Hope  my smile can switch the topic up ain't worried 'bout your friends
More concerned with where we heading, than stressin' where you been
Puttin’ out for time I put in, thought you couldn’t
Thought you wouldn’t, but it’s good
[Hook]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'ma get it cause I can, cause I can, cause I can
In my fitted in my vans, in my vans, in my vans
I think baby girl a fan, she a fan, she a fan (she a fan, she a fan)

[Post-hook]
I'm highly touted from the valley to the mountains
I ain't finished till a quarter made a car with my outfit
Came to steal your thunder like Miami in the summer man
I'm just getting over all the pressure I was under, damn

[Bridge 2]
Cool cats, you know I had to go the whole 9
Told you I was gold and this corona's on the coastline
These days, I don't know what's worthy of a co-sign
Ain't a 49er I'm just sitting on a gold mine

[Bridge]
I'm doin' this for y'all
Nah I'm just doin' this for me
I flipped the game on its tail
180 degrees
Baby please, baby please
I know you're dying to stay
I ain't gon' stop you from walkin'
Always remember the name
