That you want to never see you again
Even if I'm died, getting courage
And escape through that door

That you want to never see you again
And be brave, tell you that with the
I am better, that he understands me
Time is left over like me
He burn his blood like me
I feel new, so willing
So whole, woman of flesh and blood for love

That you want to never see you again
That you want to never see you again
That you want to close this chapter in my life
Where you were a lie and nothing else

That you want to never see you again
That you want to never see you again
Have realized that with you I am deserted
I have no more patience than invent

That you want to never see you again
I confess it, do not ask me
Make up again, no, don't ask that

That you want to never see you again
And be brave
Tell you that with Him I am better
That he understands me

Time is left over like me
He burn his blood like me
I feel new, so willing
So whole, woman of flesh and blood for love
You might also like you will never see you again
That you want to never see you again
That you want to close this chapter in my life
Where you were a lie and nothing else

That you want to never see you again
That you want to never see you again
Have realized that with you I am deserted
I have no more patience than invent
Have realized that with you I am deserted
I have no more patience than inventing
