Cowboys and Chorus Girls LyricsCowboys and Chorus Girls - ALO

Old timey tales
Of dusty trails
A rusty pail
Sits beside a salloon
Ties up his ride
The music inside
Tickles his mind
Gives a nod to the moon
Remainders of the day lay on the floor
Caesar on the stage blowing out the doors
Singing

Hold on, amigo
Just let the reins go
Always a chance for surprise
Moving east as the wind blows
Waits up for me, though
You move like a bird on a line
Coming
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Like a bird on a line
Calling
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Like the dust in the sky

Hootin and hollering
Shadows are following
She doesn't see them
But they are still there
Golden and glimmering
Fire is flickering
Somebody bickering
Legs kick up in the air
You might also likeRemainders of the day swept from the floor
Worries in her name blowing out the door
She sings

Hold on, amigo
Don't let the reins go
Always a chance for surprise
Moving east as the wind blows
Waits up for me, though
You move like a bird on a line
Coming
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Like a bird on a line
Calling
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Like the dust in the sky

Chorus boots, silver buckles
He could take you down with his bare knuckles
Everybody in the room had something to prove
Girls dressed up like Moulin Rouge
Man at the bar, I think his name was Nash
Gave a wink and a nod to a wax mustache
Serving up the drinks, tall and raw
And all the cowboys in the house singing "Yee haw!"
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
Cowboys and chorus girls
