Save It For A Rainy Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
[Verse 2]
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Verse 3]
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Outro]
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day2Embed
