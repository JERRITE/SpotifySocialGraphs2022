Vahevala Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm thinking 'bout when I was a sailor
I spent my time on the open sea
When we'd stay off the coast of Jamaica
I'd secretly steal ashore
The natives were waiting for
The boy with the lazy soul
To sing with the sailor

[Chorus]
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every evening I'd be gone
Back on board by break of dawn
[Verse 2]
I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica
Pretty girls dancing here and there
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor
The captain, he don't know
Where Billy done go
But I'm singing with native girls
The songs of a sailor (Songs of a sailor)

[Chorus]
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Hurry sailor, sail away
You better be back on board by break of day

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Every night in Jamaica, I'd sing with the lady
And drink with the men 'til the morning appear
Healthy sunshine is fresh on my face
As the song of the night would still ring in my ear

[Chorus]
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Hurry sailor, sail away (Vahevala, howe of sailor)
Be back on board by break of day
You might also like[Outro]
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, home of sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail awayEmbed
