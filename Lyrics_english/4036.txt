Lyrics catwalk [Lyrics for "Gateway"]

[Chorus]
If you are photogenic
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vain cat
If you are photogenic
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vain cat

[Verse]
I invite you to my catwalk, Damisela
Good sail, wait under the full moon
At the shore of the beach, without clothes, without towel
Modeling me to capela
I love you and I hope what I want is whole
The street dog arrived, your garden, gardener
That waits'? Give him, ma ', VÃ¡mono' light (Yeah)
Before a downpour falls
[Saying]
If you want 'I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you
Mommy, tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you
Tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you
Mommy, tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you

[Pre-car]
In that empty bed, raining at night and day (UH-WUH)
And you alone, who would say it?
In that empty bed, raining at night and day
And I here alone, look what irony
In that empty bed (UH, UH), raining at night and day
And you alone, who would say it? (UH, UH)
I have my empty bed (uh, uh) and so spends night and day
Hoping you

[Chorus]
If you are photogenic
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vain cat
If yours is to model
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vanida cat (EOH)

A thousand pleasures I will make you feel (OH-aH)
A thousand adventures I will live (eh-oh)
Your fantasies will see me comply (OH-AH)
If you dare to come (eh-oh)

[Saying]
If you want 'I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you
Mommy, tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you (hahaha)
Tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you
Mommy, tell me what you want 'and I give you what I want'
To'a the entire night to give you

[Pre-car]
In that empty bed, raining at night and day (UH-WUH)
And you alone, who would say it?
In that empty bed, raining at night and day
And I here alone, look what irony
In that empty bed (UH, UH), raining at night and day
And you alone, who would say it? (UH, UH)
I have my empty bed (uh, uh) and so spends night and day
Hoping you
[Chorus]
If you are photogenic
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vain cat
If yours is to model
Come, I invite you to my catwalk, now,
Vain cat
