Like Lyrics panas [letter from "like panas"]

[Intro]
(I put you screen at the cell
In my head you turn 'like carousel)

[Chorus]
Everything happened like this
Little by little a flame was turned on
With you wrapped myself, I didn't even expect it
Since I tried you, mommy, I got into
It all started as Pana '
With you I found what I was looking for
Baby, you handled me like a fairy
Since I tried you, mommy, I got into
[Verse 1]
(Millo Gang)
I put you screen at the cell
Enchulao 'like Alex Rodri is from Jennifer
I paint the world colored 'without using brush
In my head you turn 'like carousel
I never leave ', I will not make any fault
Baby, you won the medal
In my heart you jumped the wall
I'm going to fight for you, I will never throw the towel
The one who touches you guaya, I turn to the shrapnel
He left you cold as the Himalayas
I'm going to make you forget about that scoundrel
With you I'm always going to run through the line

[Pre-car]
Mommy, you make it another self
Get out of me, you make it another self
You cause me ', I let myself carry
That is not normal, I lose control when it touches me '
I can't help it, I start to brist, you kiss bastard

[Chorus]
Everything happened like this
Little by little a flame was turned on
With you wrapped myself, I didn't even expect it
Since I tried you, mommy, I got into
It all started as Pana '(Pana')
With you I found what I was looking for
Baby, you handled me like a fairy
Since I tried you, mommy, I got into

No one had put me like that, with you, I stayed
You are my ruby, in bed see Movie '
We are inseparable 'like Shaggy and Scooby
Like Buzz Light and Woody, Pa 'Me You Ere' Exclusive
Baby, with the other 'never, but you (always)

[Pre-car]
You make it another self
Get out of me, you make it another self
You cause me ', I let myself carry, that is not normal
I lose control when it touches me ', I can't help it
I start to bristle, you kiss bastard
(Yeah, Yeah, You, I Forever, Yeah, Yeah, Girl, You, I Forever Yeah, Yeah)

[Chorus]
Everything happened like this
Little by little a flame was turned on
With you wrapped myself, I didn't even expect it
Since I tried you, mommy, I got into
