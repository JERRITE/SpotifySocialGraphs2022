Play With Fire Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Tinnesz]
Insane, inside
The danger gets me high
Can't help myself
Got secrets I can't tell

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tinnesz]
I love the smell of gasoline
I light the match to taste the heat

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz, Sam Tinnesz & Elle Foxglove]
I've always liked to play with fire
Play with fire
Play with fire
Fire, fire
I've always liked to play with fire
[Verse 2: Sam Tinnesz & Elle Foxglove]
I ride (I ride) the edge (The edge)
My speed goes in the red
Hot blood (Hot blood), these veins (These veins)
My pleasure is their pain

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tinnesz & Elle Foxglove]
I love to watch the castles burn
These golden ashes turn to dirt

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz & Elle Foxglove]
I've always liked to play with fire
Play with fire
Play with fire
Fire, fire
I've always liked to play with fire

[Bridge: Sam Tinnesz & Elle Foxglove]
Oh
Watching as the flames get higher
Oh
I've always liked to play with
Mmm

[Verse 3: Elle Foxglove]
Rite of passage, classic maverick
Match in the gas tank, oh that's wretched
Unstoppable, legendary animal
Digital justice, now you're gonna know us
Hail to the king and queen of the ruckus
Yacht Money wired, no denying
I've always liked to play with fire

Play with fire
(I've always liked to play with fire)
Play with fire
(I've always liked to play with fire)
Fire, fire
(I've always liked to play with fire)
Always liked to play with fire
(I've always liked to play withâ€“)21Embed
