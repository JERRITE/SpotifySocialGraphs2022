You call me when you want to jangel
You call me when you want to dance
And I without but I have to answer

We left Tainy
And that pleases me that you are like this
That we go out for a site
And everyone has to look at you
And I can touch you and kiss you

When you get mommy your gifitas prada
And you're going to janguear with the lion
With your Louis Vuitton portfolio
And your Armani mahon that highlights the culaní
