Tanaka 2 Lyrics[Chorus]
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop—
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop—
Run it, run it
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop—
Run it, run it
[Verse 1: Joey Valence]
Young boy, hop out, yes, I'm a knockout
I bring fire when a Pop-Tart pop out
Born from a volcano
I Drain Gang like a sink drain Drano
Uncanny, I'm goin' hammy
Hit a hundred note streak, hit the whammy bar
I rap tight like a Trojan, that woman is a bad omen
I like it dangerous, dangerous
You can not hang with us, Godzilla put the flame in us
There is no savin' us, there is no changin' us
I'm an alien from another planet
Super-powered, bet you can't stand it
I spit flamе, Waka Flocka
Create a monster, shoutout Tanaka

[Chorus]
Hit thе pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop—

[Verse 2: Logic]
Goddamn, walk up and they know who I am
Got R.A.M, that means that I keep the game runnin'
A hundred thousand in jewelry, I'm stunnin'
And stuntin' like Evel Knievel
My life is a movie, motherfuck a Regal
I'm bombin' atomically, nothin' you do astonish me
Honestly, I'm not tryna be anybody but me
And they wanna body me, where's the camaraderie?
I want my brothers to win, but they want the blood, I open they carotid artery
That ought to be all that I need, I'm hard to see
I close the studio door, then open up every part of me
Fuck my generation, dead 'em all, assassination
Life is balanced, time to make some room for Brae
And Joey Valence, where the talent?
Bars and beats, they got me wylin'
I'm just tryna shed a little light on artists that deserve it
Over this hip beat, that's perfect
When Logic grip the mic', you know I'm always finna murk this
Yeah, yeah, listen up
You might also like[Chorus]
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop—

[Verse 3: Brae]
Boom bada, pop rocker, shock collar
Hypnotize like my name Big Poppa
Non-stopper, baby, holla
Put ya chin up when ya talk, I'm taller
I'm a lover, no fighter, kisser, no biter
Lit like a lighter, this fire gettin' brighter
Call a firefighter, my fist gettin' tighter
Right hook to your jaw, copyright biter
Non-Stop, Denzel
Heavyweight, Rocky, barbell
Oh, you slick? I'm John Wick
Rambo how I swing the sticks
Fave flavour is vanilla, late night flight to Manila
In a jet flying over Godzilla
I'm the iller killer, beat on my chest like gorilla

[Chorus]
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock
Hit the pop rock, hit the pop rock1Embed
