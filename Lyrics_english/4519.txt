TranslationsРусскийEspañolTHE REV3NGE Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch, I'm really, really out for blood this time, look (No, really)
Woo (Hands up)

[Chorus]
I just came back for the win
Lotta new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge

[Verse]
Heard they was sleepin' again, say it no more
This is a rude awakenin', kick in the door
Back and I'm better than ever before
Don't get it mistaken, I'm ready for war
I see the opps and I'm uppin' the score
I catch a body, then jump in the Porsche
Follow the coroner back to the morgue
Take the sheet off and I kill 'em some more
When I am done at the scene, I won't leave anything
You won't even know who was involved
Don't let me do it, 'cause I overdo it
And do it till I cannot do it no more
All of the doubters, I'm provin' 'em wrong
Back with a classic, I know it's been long
Heard they was missing me while I was gone
I smell a victory, back up on top and it's where I belong
Like that ain't shit to me, we makin' history
Fought through the misery, weathered the storm
Can't let them get to me, no weapon formed shall prosper
R&B bitches all over my roster, bitch, I got options (Huh, huh)
I keep a chopper right on the dresser, next to the Oscar (Huh, woo)
Applyin' pressure, somebody stop us (Woo)
Applyin' pressure, somebody stop us
Run in my casa, gon' need a doctor
Gon' need a doctor, gon' need a (What?)
[Chorus]
I just came back for the win (Yeah, what?)
Lotta new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge (Woo, woo)
I just came back for the win (Yeah)
Lotta new money in my hand (Woo, woo)
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge (Woo)

[Bridge]
So now they on my body
Made it to the top, ain't no way that they could stop me now (Now)
They gon' say I joined Illuminati
I got demons all around me, tell me: what they know about me? Huh (What?)

[Chorus]
I just came back for the win (Yeah, what)
Lotta new money in my hand (What, woo)
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend (What? What? What?)
They say success is the best revenge (Yeah, woo, woo)
I just came back for the win (Yeah)
Lotta new money in my hand (Woo, woo)
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revengeYou might also like9Embed
