Let me in lyrics [letter of "let me in"]

[Intro]
UH, Yeh
UH, Yeh
Love
Makano

[Pre-car]
I want to know (I want to know)
How to make you look at me
If I am in love with you
I want to know (I want to know)
What does he have that I do not
I don't have me
[Chorus]
Let me enter (let me in)
To your life and your heart
That I want just give you love
My love
Let me enter (let me in)
To your life and your heart (love, love)
That I want just give you love
My love

[Verse 1]
If you knew how much I am suffering
Because I know well that I am not your owner
This pain is consuming me
I would like to love you without time limit
How would I like this to be a dream
And be with you every moment
But it's very sad because you already have an owner

[Chorus]
Let me enter (let me in)
To your life and your heart
That I want just give you love
My love
Let me enter (let me in)
To your life and your heart (love, love)
That I want just give you love
My love

What I can do?
Unfortunately yesterday I saw you with him
I saw you happy, I can do nothing
Fate made me a bad play again
What I can do? I had to lose

[Chorus]
Let me in
To your life and your heart (to your heart)
That I want just give you love (love)
My love
Let me enter (let me in), love
To your life and your heart
And to your soul, my love
My love, please
Come to your soul
My love, my love, my love, no, no
Let me enter, let me enter you
Love
