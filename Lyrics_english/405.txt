Fuck that lil' bitch, we gon' take her down (Smash)
Ice on her wrist, kissed the finger now (Ice)
Big double cup with the pinky out (Double cup)
Blue Benjis long like a slinky now
Locking in, you know the gang, we locking in (Locking in)

You know I told your bitch if I'ma I spend it (Spend it)
She gotta drop her top and show her titties
I got the thirty on me when I hit it (Hit it)

Lock in the bando, I don't need nothin' but water
The baking soda, then I whip 'til it's harder
I popped out the crib with your lil' bitty daughter
I fucked and then put that lil' ho on the MARTA
The Bentley, the 'Rari, I swap with the Benz
Parked the Rolls car, then I hopped in sedan
I just had got that lil' bitch from my mans
So I was fuckin' that ho with my chain in my hand
All gold Rollie with an off-white tan
My son got a Saint Laurent ring on his hand
I just copped some molly, it was lookin' like sand
Shittin' on you niggas, wanna keep this shit stainless
I was kickin' my shit like Jackie Chan
Peanut butter wrist, fuck a nigga saying?
Take it off his wrist, serve a nigga strand
Look at my neck and my wrist from 'Pan

[Verse 4: Gunna]
Big face Patek with a chocolate band (Yeah)
Look at my wrist, don't take no dance (Take no dance)
Bought an aircraft, I landed on land (Land)
Luger Lex flex, two-hundred on sedan (Two-hundred)
Thirty-five hundred on blue jean pants (Swag)
Yeah, Chrome Heart brand (Chrome)
Throw the money up, barely pop another band (Pop another tag)
Bitch pussy poppin' on the stand (Woah)
We red light, green light, all of 'em getting ran (Skrrt)
Pretty bitches OD, and all of 'em getting ran (All of 'em getting ran)
Fuck all the police, free my dawg out the can (Woah)
Whip top off the V, double cup in my hand (Skrrt)
Big Dior IP, drip in Louis V Vans (Uh)
Looking at me like she wanna advance (Woah)
I take one more pill and the rest will enhance
Young Wunna, your man cost an arm and a leg (Arm and a leg)
[Chorus: Quavo]
Fuck my lil' money, I want a lil' mouth (Su')
