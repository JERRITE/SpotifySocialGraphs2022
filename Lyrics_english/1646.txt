Blue Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
We were coastin' on the coast when you opened my eyes
Made me notice where the ocean is holding the sky, right
I was blinded
Your smile shining behind those green eyes
The horizon so enticing
Please say you'll be mine

[Hook]
Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything, it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far
[Verse 2]
My afternoon dream when the world is speedin'
I am still sleepin' in my blue dream
And I know the meaning for all the seasons
You are the reason, my love
My mind is open so wide since you came inside
I feel so alive
Without you life just passes by, passes by, passes by

[Hook]
Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything, it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far

[Bridge]
My afternoon dream when the world is sleeping
I am still thinking of my blue dream
It's bliss

[Hook]
Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything, it seems that you are
The truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when the world is sleeping
I am still thinking of my blue dream
It's bliss102Embed
