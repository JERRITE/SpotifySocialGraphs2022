[Intro: nlflow]
This is the machinery
In the real pattern

[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash
And heart pa ’let it fall
Don't talk shit
My sister ', if you don't pull'
Don't live it that you don't have the paper
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash
And heart pa 'let it fall
Don't talk shit
My sister ', if you don't pull'
Don't live it that you don't have the paper
[Verse 1: Mackie]
Wah
Yeh, I'm the fabulous (c'mon)
Many do not know about my majestic plan (Yah)
They throw photos because I am famous (Yah)
Like Picasso, Collection are my verses (c'mon)
In this I am like a professional chef (chef)
I have my own sauce
Many want to compete, but they don't pass the test (EY)
I pause your career
I have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash
And to the envious vamo 'to break
So that no ’tea speaking shit
My sister ’, if you don't pull '
In E’ta Movie does not have 'paper

[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash
And heart pa 'let it fall
Don't talk shit
My sister ’, if you don't pull '
I don't live it in you 'that you don't have the paper
The Flow Is Back

[Verse 2: ñejo]
Still broke, but not the broke at all
If you need to write a guy, give me a call
Take out the 'Chavito', Papi, Fuck The Fame
Mine and 'smoking krippy, mommy, fuck cocaine
Insane in the brain, I killed them, like Tego
And if by chance I RESUCITA I CAN DEMEGANE
I can to bring the pain, I put
And if your jeva gets brute, I also put it
It seems that it is looking for her to please her
The condom broke, if it comes to head when your son is born
Now on the street, they tell me bobumm
Because when the lirique'o to 'the world hits the world
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of crawl
And heart pa 'let it fall
Don't be speaking shit, my sister ', that you don't pull'
What pulls' is running

Yaga & Mackie, 'Toy in To'a
From Jory to To'a
Always put whatever
The 'comb' are long ', corduroy, like boa
I mean, take for you to pass it ugly
The street 'tá' hot, hot is the break
The baby are hot, hot, there are the baby, vamo 'there
I mean, a lot of shine, corillo, simple
Impossible when seen and not seen (with permission)

[Verse 4: Archangel]
Of the false movie you are the actrice '
I live to the real, so daddy, take it easy
To 'who wants to war, how quickly let me know
If I walk 'giving chain', they evíte the 'scar'
And don't be a mouth or give you 'fogon
I am the one in my fuckin 'alley
They 'tan disorienta and they were sought to step on it
It will be because of the heroine they inhaled for their noses
I have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cake
And an attitude that almost nobody supports it
And don't speak 'shit, my sister', if you don't pull '
Don't live it that you don't have the paper

[Verse 5: Franco "El Gorilla"]
The beast (rrrra) arrived, I am like Mazinger (Ajá)
They tell me "machine, destroy them" and take the challenger
And do not laugh, that I live better than you
One and I put the Mercedes as a capota
For the demons of the ink I am the beast in hell
Under the de'o and even the devil can lose both horns
I have cash, I have flow, I also have a lot of shine
From Trujillo and invoicing more than half millo
What are they going to do when they see the flash (jeh, jeh, jeh)
And the crystals of your car making crash (rrrra)
The rifle pa 'inside and your ceso' paste of dash
Do not worry that your widows will continue to give cash
Papa Upa (RRRRA) arrived, the King Koopa (RRRRA)
This is envious, why not chew and suck
You have to look for it with magnifying glass
And calm, that your cat likes me to escape it
I have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cake
And from my house I do not go out without the short
And don't speak 'shit, fool, if you don't pull'
The ink of you with water to delete the paper
[Verse 6: Dalmata]
I i i
If I changed rap for corduroy, I sold more for bushes
And riddles with a post -fourth room
Very simple, threatening, like Light Pa 'cigarillo
Elegant, without diamond, but with a lot of shine
And I 'mato easy
Faranduleando in car or by bike '
Ah, ah, I have it in Crici '
I point a heart attack
Hand up, this is assault
Like Bella, I 'delivery

[Verse 7: July volt]
I'm champion
Cold in La Lca, Chilindrino
Street is street, fine
Daniño attitude
The voltage already came out, the murderer
I disappear them, na 'more' to put a comb aladino
The one that the list has arrived.
I came to fumigate to 'e'ta cockroach'
More than ten years of good streak
I am a line, daddy, Voltio was not written
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of combo
And if you put a clown I break you
Don't talk shit
That here the thing is bad
And none of you pull

[Verse 8: yaga]
They have to endure me until the day I die
And more unbearable when the breaks comes out
Cash fan, even addictive
Thanks to my fans, I'm still alive
They all know about me, even Osama mama me
He had to knock the 'tower' pa 'to have my fame
That it hurts to see my face when I go on TV
In concerts and hotels, walking with women
They do not blur
Better closes his mouth or passes the truck between eyebrow and mustache
You saw 'in bruise and more than a thousand assertions
And Yaga & Mackie are famous because their songs sound

[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash (I said, J)
And heart pa 'let it fall
Don't talk shit
My sister ', if you don't pull'
I don't live it in you 'that you don't have the paper

[Verse 9: Ñengo Flow]
The earth is shaking (Wuh), there is a warning of hurricane
Don't look for you that on my forehead I drew a scorpion (EY)
Starting membrane, spirit and to 'that thing'
When the fulles are nitrosas, Montana is something else
When you let it fall you will feel power (Wuh)
And if you try to chote, kill you 'inside the barracks
Viro until you stop moving completely (prr)
Hard fire, yes, yes, pa 'your skeleton
The event is over, I don't eat 'story
So he holds, that Guelo and the real guideline returned
With astronaut costumes' and the rifles in hand
There are many that snore and little they put hand
Tell me, piranha, your humility no longer deceives me
You are a mouth that 'Sest spider
No I am surprised to get the guarapo to the cane (dile)
I put it to come, like the jet 'and the champagne
Have a lot of shine, diamonds pa 'border
And the power to let it fall
Don't keep talking shit, my sister ', if you don't pull'
To which you will feel the power

[Verse 10: Guelo Star]
You have no shine, I am the owner of the rake
Cacoteo de la Calle, Lo Hamillo street
Surely I live it if the style always childs (oh)
You are minced, picapiedras, pica, pica
They have no resistance, endure turbulence
When the motor-tor exploits you [?]
Of reggaeton I am the essence
You are the princesses (OH)
Little girls who tear, cape and gaguean
Cua-how, when I start your face with the Bloke (OH)
Feel the impact if you bleed when they charge you (yes)
You Cotorrhea, is a tongue, blowrobotes
Don't be Agostos, Monigote, or we fuck you in block (OH)

[Verse 11: j alvarez]
Tell Montana, who since we left this undefeated
And that we saw 'pa' the farm with the 'mamasita' in Gistro
Pa 'lo' three stick ', music from other levels
This is high hierarchy, like Pablo on the poster
He
And with women new to 'lo' day 'under cheese
Mere, bastard, don't ask where dream
I do not move it to anyone for my voice to have weight
What you 'go doing now, I already did
Mine was real, I was going down ticket
Pa 'to criticize me', I have more audience
I'm invoicing without investing almost na '
A lot of shine, a lot of flow
A short one that tells me "if there is a problem, let me go"
That if you have to work someone myself I give
I don't speak much, the one who knows me knows who I am

[Verse 12: lui-g 21 plus]
You snore a lot (Jah)
But as you are many, fool
Only with your eyes you apachur
Stop talking so much shit
What a living 'in Puerto Rico, remember
We have more weight than a fat gym
Assholes like you ears deaf '
Bocas like you are four on board (hey)
In a tintia 'car,' do you shit? (SW?)
They say you're going to do, when are you going to do it? (Go ahead)
What the hell are you waiting for? To be born again? (Na ')
That bla-bla-white already became fashionable
Here you act, pla-pla-pla and that fucks
A gun is anyone (anyone)
Do you have 'do' ball balls to use it? Shoot
You can come with the combo you want '(Dale)
I'm going alone, I'm a man and I face

[Chorus: J Alvarez]
Have a lot of shine, a lot of flow, a lot of cash
And heart pa 'let it fall
Don't talk shit
My sister ', if you don't pull'
Don't live it that you don't have the paper

[Interlude: Archangel]
'Tá well, this is real guideline
To 'the world has thrown well
To 'the world has a bastard,' toy very happy (yes, yes, yes)
But I don't understand, with you I have to buzz more

[Verse 13: Archangel]
Hey, we walk with Montana
I mean that money is piled up
What you charge for Party I spend it on Corona
I continue on fire, very hot in the area
International, the mono 'in the Amazon', I ', listen to me,
That I bastard, nothing strange
I billed like 800 last year
No guantanamera label
2010, now float in Panamera

[Outro: nlflow]
Hey, we are blessed
We have to 'the shine, monster
The Flow Is Back
Montana "The Producer"
Perreke, the CEO
DJ Wassie
NElflow
This is the machinery in the intro of real guideline
Working 7 days, 24 hour '
Don't rest 'and the book is still full
Without investing much, he heard?
Hey, and remember that
Envy is just the reflection of your admiration to machinery
Guelo, we do have shine
Check them alive
