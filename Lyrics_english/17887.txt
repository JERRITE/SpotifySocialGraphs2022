The snow over time Lyricsio I spend next to you like snow over time
I had had at least one soul to defend
I hear the voices and the poor Erika in the living room cry
The statues of the night, that night covered with dust
And your hands, your words as shadows on the ceiling
I lying on a white sheet like the snow
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow over time
I live this life as snow over time
Maria's eyes look at me from an image hanging over the bed
And I imagine your hair from the cracks to the walls
And I trace your profile with your mouth and finger on all windows
But your hands, your face, your hands are erased in a moment
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow over time
Let me shout, let me fall like snow over time
Fall into an endless bed, shout, shout and cry in silence
Suffocate tears and words with anger and pain
Ridam me your hands, your smile, your breath, your hands
I relive our dreams
I lying on a white sheet like the snow
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow over time
Like snow, like snow in Tempayou Might Also Likeebed
