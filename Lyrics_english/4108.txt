BELLA (REMIX) LYRICS [LETTER OF "BELLA (REMIX)" FT. Maluma]

[Intro: Maluma]
LOL
Remix
Wolfine
Maluma, Baby, Muah

[Pre-car: Maluma & Wolfine]
Yesterday your friends told me
That you were looking for me crazy in the street
And I drink like crazy beer
With parriers damaging my head
Drunk with bad heart
Walking alone, I found her
[Chorus: Wolfine]
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws

[Verse 1: Maluma]
(Maluma, Baby, Prr)
You took me in a moment of weakness
I sworn that I was never going to touch you again
All because of those damn beers
With those lips in front, who does not kiss you (Muah)
Because I wasn't able to give him stop
In the ranking of my 'ass' you were always the top
We screw up in the relationship
We leave it crazy, so without protection

[Bridge: Maluma]
It was too late and I with the drinks' in the head
You are my weakness, I love when you get foolish
It was too late and I with the drinks' in the head
You are my weakness, nobody straighters you

[Chorus: Wolfine & Maluma]
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws
(Maluma, Baby)

They told me you were a little sad
That you started drinking and with a man you left
Ay baby, you damaged my heart
I no longer believe in love, now for you I am worse
Ay baby, you damaged my heart
I no longer believe in love, now for you I am worse

[Pre-car: Maluma & Wolfine]
Yesterday your friends told me
That you were looking for me crazy in the street (haha)
And I drink like crazy beer
With parriers damaging my head

[Chorus: Maluma, Maluma & Wolfine]
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws
So beautiful woman and I with a bottle
I let myself be entangled, I fell into her claws
