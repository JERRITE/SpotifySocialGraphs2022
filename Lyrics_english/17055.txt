TranslationsPortuguês​sucks to see you doing better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Picked up a shift on a Friday
Saw you at the counter so I ran away
Waited till you got your drink and watched you leave
But I used to say, "Hey babe, your drinks on me"

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a big city with an even bigger paycheque
Heard you got a new honey and a rooftop deck
Lucky that you're not with me 'cause you're living so A-List
Making all your money and I can't make rent
[Chorus]
You're doing better than me, I admit it
Found someone better than me and I get it
You're better off and I'm worse than ever
(Sucks to see you doing better)

[Verse 2]
Heard 'Lonely Weekend' on the highway
Broken air condition in a heat wave
See you passing by me in the HOV
With somebody else in your passenger seat

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a big city, acting like you're so famous
Tryna keep myself busy like you don't exist
Lucky that you're not with me 'cause I'm living so aimless (Yeah, I'm living so aimless)
Always go to bed dizzy with an empty chest

[Chorus]
You're doing better than me, I admit it
Found someone better than me and I get it
You're better off and I'm worse than ever
(Sucks to see you doing better)
You're doing better than me and I hate it
Found someone better and I'm devastated
You're better off and I'm lost forever
(Sucks to see you doing better)
You might also like[Bridge]
I wish I didn't work late
And it's too late now to work it out
And I wish that I could wish you well
But I can't even do that for myself
Could have run a marathon or married a doctor
But instead I'm watching marathons of Harry Potter
And you heard from a friend, of a friend, of a friend
I get lonely (Lonely, lonely, lonely)
In a basement apartment with the laminate floors
Giving up on my health for the drugs when I'm bored
And I gain a few likes for every meal I ignore
I've been dying since the day I was born

[Break]
Lately I think I'll die alone

[Chorus]
You're doing better than me, I admit it
Found someone better than me and I get it
You're better off and I'm worse than ever
You're doing better than me and I hate it
Found someone better and I'm devastated
You're better off and I'm lost forever
(Sucks to see you doing better)1Embed
