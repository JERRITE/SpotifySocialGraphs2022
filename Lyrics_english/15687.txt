Guapa Lyrics [lyrics for "Guapa"]

[Intro]
(Mhh)
(Mhh)
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah

[Part 1]
She writes to me when I think of her
Small emoji, no texts (Ahh)
She looks good, she is legend
And a very intelligent
I'm in the studio all night, don't worry, I'm doing songs
Anyway there is none that gets on your ass
Does anyone make a problem? We fuck him directly
No matter who, also the Prime Minister
Must with her in no bars or in restaurants
With her I even love S-Bahn
Paparazzi make click, press scandal (AHH)
But I feel shit, everyone should experience it
[Hook]
Do you feel like me too
Or am I alone with it?
Can't look away from your face
How perfect can you actually be?
Tell me, you feel like me too
Or am I alone with it?
There is war again on the Strada
But with you I forget the time

[Part 2]
Whenever I see yours on the display '
I'm fine, no matter how I can
Whenever I see yours on the display '
I'm fine, no matter how I can
I laugh with you about everything like with Bonez
Pull in with me and I wear the boxes
Small argument, but after that everything is again as usual
After that everything is again as usual, Ah-AH-AH
I make plans with you, I like every scenario
And when I see you

[Hook]
I ask myself, you also feel like me
Or am I alone with it?
Can't look away from your face
How perfect can you actually be?
Tell me, you feel like me too
Or am I alone with it?
There is war again on the Strada
But with you I forget the time
Tell me, do you feel like me too?
Or am I alone with it?
Can't look away from your face
How perfect can you actually be?
Tell me, you feel like me too
Or am I alone with it?
There is war again on the Strada
But with you I forget the time
Tell me, do you feel like me too?
You might so like [Outro]
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah
My Guapa, my Guapa, my Guapa, Ah1embed
