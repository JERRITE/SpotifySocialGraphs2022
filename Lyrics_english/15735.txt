You came to my life Lyrics [lyrics of "you came into my life"]

[Verse 1]
You came to my life
No time or appointment
Putting the wind in favor
Changing everything
Stealing sleep hours
Sneaking into all my dreams

[Pre-stribe]
And tell me how I do to teach you what I don't even know
Tell me how do I do so much to learn
[Chorus]
That I want you to know that I will be what has to be
THE TYRITA THAT CURE YOU
Your comet for the clouds
That I want you to know that I will be what it is to be
Your favorite superhero
Your favorite singer

[Verse 2]
I confess that I have looked at the roof some other night
Because it always scares what is unknown
If I will live up, I don't know that
But I take a ladder and always be taking care of you
Giving you everything you deserve
Kissing you when it dawns
Helping you when you stumble

[Chorus]
That I want you to know that I will be what has to be
THE TYRITA THAT CURE YOU
Your comet for the clouds
That I want you to know that I will be what has to be
Your favorite superhero
Your favorite singer

That I want you to know that I will be what has to be
THE TYRITA THAT CURE YOU
Your comet for the clouds
That I want you to know that I will be what has to be
Your favorite superhero (your favorite superhero)
Your favorite singer (your favorite singer)

That I want you to know that I will be, that I will be
That I want you to know that I will be, that I will be, that it will be
