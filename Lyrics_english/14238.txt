Evaporate lyricstempo we have 
 How much do we give 
 Run what to run 
 It costs what it costs 
 Time we give 
 How much do we have 
 It costs what to run 
 Run what cost 
 The time I wasted 
 Only now I know 
 Learn to give 
 That's what I won 
 And I'm still behind 
 Of that time 
 Not running 
 And he finds me 
 Ahh don't move 
 Hummingbird 
 The river is there 
 The water ran 
 Arrives at the tide 
 He becomes sea 
 How to die 
 Go 
 Heaven 
 Purify 
 Ahh, leave behind
