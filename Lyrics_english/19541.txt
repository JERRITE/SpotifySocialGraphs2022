Welcome To The Revolution Lyrics[Chorus]
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised, welcome to the revolution
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised welcome to the revolution

[Verse 1]
The revolution won't be televised , government been tellin’ lies
If you’re not with us, you better step aside
Witnessing a genocide, everything is centralized
The food that we consume and they spraying it all with pesticides
Easily identify the sheep and the snake the real and the fake
Givin’ us a reason to pray, i’ma make my own choices
A voice for the voiceless, they try’na destroy us, avoiding the poison
It’s all pointless if you don’t have a purpose
If you read the verses, you’ll know who we versing
Government can’t tell you what your worth is, look deeper than the surface
They don’t even want you researching
Or asking questions we all being tested
Shh shut your mouth then comply that’s the message
Want you depressed on prescription that mess with your head
Got you stressin’, suppressing expression
[Chorus]
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised, welcome to the revolution
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised welcome to the revolution

[Verse 2]
Keep the money, I would rather have my soul
They want power and control
That’s their number one goal
All my friends turn to foes, look how easily they fold
Even Nazis said they were doing what they’re told
Walking down this road, all alone in the cold
But my soul never sold, I’m exposing the clones
God has chosen this role, although those who oppose
Want me hopeless and broke like I’m Noah on boats
I’m just tryin’ to tell ’em all ‘bout the flood
I can feel it in my bones, I can feel it in my blood
Man, I came up out the mud, only God is my judge
I don’t listen to these politicians, they’re the real thugs
Won’t comply with the lies they disguising as science
They want you complying, the media’s biased
These corporate giants are capitalizing on us by dividing, but I'll keep on fighting

[Chorus]
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised, welcome to the revolution
They’re trying to dumb us down, don’t want us to make a sound
We gotta get louder now, ‘cause it’s a revolution
We will not comply, with the institutions sick illusion
No, it won't be televised, welcome to the revolutionYou might also likeEmbed
