TranslationEnglishel Sol does not return Lyrics [lyrics by "The Sun does not return"]

[Verse 1]
I lost days ago in some canteen
Half of my soul plus the fifteen tip
It is not that alcohol is the best medicine
But it helps forget when you don't see the exit

[Chorus]
Today I try to tell you that everything is going well even if you don't believe it
Although at this point a last effort is not worth it
Today the good memories will fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas, the clouds leave, but the sun does not return
[Verse 2]
Road hotel room dreams
And a few drops of rain that I keep in this suitcase
They roll for the mattress of my bed already deserted
It is the best headache solution

[Chorus]
Today I try to tell you that everything is going well even if you don't believe it
Although at this point a last effort is not worth it
Today the good memories will fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas, the clouds leave, but the sun does not return

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Today I try to tell you that everything is going well even if you don't believe it
Although at this point a last effort is not worth it
Today the good memories will fall down the stairs
And after several tequilas, the clouds leave, but the sun does not return
And after several tequilas, the clouds leave, but the sun does not return

[Outro]
And after several tequilas, the clouds leave, but the sun does not return Might Also Like1embed
