Give this video that is going to go viral (ha!)
Faster than Nascar (Wuh), as meat 'e cow
I have the fat bug, the very skinny legs (yi)
Mai 'Open your legs, Jon Z puts it to you (yi, yi)
But if you preem you, your male waves it
I have a pale and pair of Bellacas
Chingo in the hammock, I put it and take it out, pull like an ak
A Corillo de Dementes, crazy like Jackass's
I do not take with the bichis, nor eat them peanut (PRRA)
Neither with the chapis, seek guideline, nor the dogs viral can
Neither with snakes, neither toads nor the rats (YI)
But with the hare and paste
And to 'these rappers I lame for them like Chata (Buah!)
Supersonic flow, diabolical, magnificent
It leaves you paralytic, in a critical condition (Wuh)
Something explicit, I read hieroglyphs (Wuh)
Something super "Saiyanistic"
I just invented this word (haha)
But to me without balls, I am going to rhyme
Jon speaks meaningless because he says the same
If everything I speak here is true
Tell me, tell me Wey, Wey, Everyday, I live like a king (Wuh)
I smoke and play play, real, never fake (ha!)
I learn to 'the days of the mystakes (YI)

Thank God for the bread of the table (Wuh)
And for my letter that forever weighs (Yeah)
Delivering pizzas collided cars
Before people said it was a charro (ha!)
Now I full of code a jug

Or an ozzy rock, I feel happy
Turn on a joint, put Bob Marley (Yah)
I do not criticize, nor envy (NAH)
Fuck yours, I have mine (fuck)
They want evil and I bless you (Yi)
In the bad times I always laugh (Jaaa!)
Flow parapelo, I am Curry and you Carmelo

Until I die, and if I die today (today)
Loot to's my songs for you who know who I am (I am)
For you see that I'm stronger than Floyd (Floyd)

But I'm not going to die na ', I'm going to make history
Burning sativa, I go to glory (yi; yi)
I love my life, with my girlfriend '
And to'as my chillas, crazy and sober '
I get it as you want
It is a beast, but it is not the first
Find out how, where do you prefer
Your cat gets gross, pear takes it (Yi)
You might also like hearts in all my relationships
And everything I tell in all my songs
Sometimes I feel bad, sometimes
But that he fucks, God forgive me (PRRA)
Says' Yes, I'm going to go for hell
If that is so, then it is in winter (Wuh)
Before I stole, like the government
And torque of cats hit my horn '(PRRA)
But he fucks, he deserved it
Karma always comes, and you don't know the day (Yi, Yi)
No one pays, that's why he doesn't trust
Well, students, the tutoring began (ha!)
Mamen with my flow, I stole the show
Here we go, tell me Bow Wow (Wuh, Wuh)
That I get well bastard
And I'm not a mothers, I gave him a slam dunk
They didn't give me a plug, Stephen LeBron tell me
We are abnormal (Wuh, Wuh, Wuh)
I have pales, I show you which
You are my children and change the diapers (Yi, Yi)
Those who say they are loyal are always turned
I am the subject and the predicate
Baking an expert, the best created
Fuck the past, I live the present
I have cried a lot because of the people (wuh)
False friends, false loves
They are not with you at worse moments (Yeah)
With one hand I tell my best friends
They are like older brothers (PRRA)
One is Panny, the other is Anel (Yi)
The third is Benji, the room is José
And ma 'Nigga Rotger, we took in Boyer
In Lancer, now at Mercedes Benz (Skrt-Skrt)
Greetings to Net, greetings to Caldé
My Flow stinks, I just screwed it up (Yi, Yi)
I'm going to push, I shoot a peseta
Pa 'that I double and take it Elinnette (Jaa!)
I am a real g, and you Ali G
You Ere 'A Wannabe, Sndo Smelebi'
I started from below, from afar I saw them (vi)
But hard ran and bastards, I'm here (I'm here)
I give advice 'and I don't apply them (JA)
I look in the mirror and with me talk (wuh)
I do not leave me and to the one to take a peak
Without fantasy, I break the snout
I am humble, handy, not cowardly
Controversial, like Tego Calde '
I left the street because it is burning
And with cold water I threw a bucket (splash!)
I will be a legend, I'm going to be a King
Without much chain, without much bling-bling
In such a way that when I die
To your children, your grandchildren, you will talk about me (Skrt-Skrt)
I dream biggie, you Small (Buah!)
You do not shine with Armor All (Yi, Yi)
Take the shore that I go to the mile '
I jump out of the chair that I now go (Buah!)
I'm not a character, bastard, I'm real (YI)
Although sometimes a pair of lies' (Buah!)
I did not come down, that you are going to arrive
At another levels, so that they adjust '
Short camouflage, middle and vans (wuh)
They see me and copy, you bastard, are they lusted '? (Wuh)
I just got to get
The one who fucks with me zumbo a Hadouken (Wuh)
Bonus or lace, do not try to guayar
Or fast command to be executed (wuh)
Brother, work and do not start envying
It is not my fault that my success frustrates you
Educated, without manners, Jon stands out (Wuh)
If you are going to get in face, Manín, don't give away '
To the poor, to the rich, the treatment by equals (YI)
Pa 'me is not a science rhymes vowels (Yi)
I'm going to explain you, I start with the A
I go viral, liberal, overcome, arrive and succeed
And without limiting, and without imitating, original (Wuh)
Rhyme, improvise, ever stop
Call fame, drama, mom when you record
Super Saiyan, go, I continue with the e
I smoked, I clouded, I stuck, I succeeded
I walked on foot, and Capié two out of ten
I grew up and go hungry, and suffered (yi, yi)
I continue with the I, this challenge ate it
Digerí, the beat I left for it, I was not
It was Jon Z or Luis Fonsi
Despacito, rhyme with the o (yi, yi)
I put the protocol a little crazy like focus
I'm wrong, a coconut choco, I suffer little by little
I control myself and I just arrived and I play it (Wuh)
I smoke and roller arriving at the lu '
Now I close and end with the U
My youth I enjoy with attitude
Proud of my talent and all my virtue
Before I was scared to sing to crowd (ah)
Now I fly to the platform without Red Bull (Piu ')
To heal the games, green, red and blue
They have prio 'to PR, in a coffin
Fuck the vowels, I finished them (Yi)
Writing this challenge really took me (Yi)
Tell me René, at times I thought
I couldn't, but I really did it
I travel without seeing, floating in the wind (wuh)
To 'these rapper' that take a seat (ha!)
I am the hardest, bastard, I swear
That a vowel that does not exist invented me (PRRA)
I did not hit one, I made many attempts
Give it back, handy, don't lie to you (Buah!)
They underestimate my flow and my talent
They didn't give it to me and now it's my moment
I greet Juncos, to 'my brothers (YI)
I come from the town, from Valencian (YI)
The slope was long, but I arrived at the plain
Thanks to the colleagues who shake hands (YI)
My Nigga Rasta, Lyan, Noriel
My Nigga Jamsha, Juanka, Darkiel
Messiah, Eladio, Nigga domain
Dimelo Ñengo, and Wiso G (Wuh)
And to the DJ, like DJ Warner
Filming and Coby who are my partners (YI)
Quality and Duran, and Andre Gigante
Torres and Yondoe, are mine apart (Yi, Yi)
If one stayed, well, mine
I don't 'talk to some for hypocrisy
But, no ', normal, I'm still in mine
The more they envy me, the more I catch up
[Outro]
