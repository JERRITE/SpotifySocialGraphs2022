Hell-o Lyrics [intro: Ian]
Yeah, Ayy, I didn't ...

[Chorus: Ian]
I have no school, I have class, I have bando at home
I have blood to do it, yes I don't care
I have pussy in the net, don't leave me, a pile on the table, I put it on
Leave the cardeala, the harneal, I want a lion
Leave the spell, I jump you like a kite
Hate cracks you and you don't have any anyway
Occult, they only produce it with my brother
[Strofa 1: Ian]
Åži i chapled a zombi gang
I make you give Ortu 'Popii
You know I don't burn my shots
And you know you don't go out with mine, with ours
Are monsters, it breaks your brain, lobes
I don't give time to emotions
Stay pussy to the queues
I am looking for profions, they did not believe that I can
Stay in your bank, coat, smells stupid

[Strofa 2: Azteca]
Smells stupid what I did is endure
MIRRIES Died like in Koala Lumpur
It fucks it when it stands goat and a finger in the ass (SKRR)
Excuse me, I am vulgar CAN'-S TABADUR
I have, in Bando, a pack of nasal white and in the package a draco (yeah)
I have, like Rambo, I leave you brother in shock, like Cotu 'when you touch your nerve (huh)
Smells stupid what I did is endure
MIRRIES Died like in Koala Lumpur
It fucks it when it stands goat and a finger in your ass
Excuse me, I'm vulgar that I'm Tabadur
I have, in Bando, a pack of nasal white and in the package a Draco, Grra
I have, like Rambo, I leave you brother in shock like Cotu 'when you touch your nerve'

[Strofa 3: Ian]
I am in a pussy, my brothers are running well, I put on the table 'thick and boil'
In a bolid, I went on vacation, you want to have my step, yes 'coat, you have no stream'
In a robe, dead, when we climb into the elevator
Pussy and burn it in flit
Full of thug in the feat
Envelope them empty, my row to pic
We burn it with about four here
We burn it, coat, a life here
We burn it, worry-free
Live a life without fear
Even if they are full it gives scars
Do you ban, when you force you, push
You make weight when you lift
You want to be in the top, you have to overcome them

I stayed in a row, tell me it's a moment '
To break a country, I barely took my momentum
In Elan, I with Ian I left your parchment '
In one hundred years not to forget the current '
We break you timpa ', it has been drawn to you current'
I opened the gates for you, to know trendu '
Correctly and concretely, you can give me a spit
You make us statue, like Hagi I have talentu '

An iron that makes, prrr
And a pizza what he says, grrr
Foreign car, SKRRR
I have ice on me, brrr
An iron that makes, prrr
And a pizza what he says, grrr

[Chorus: Ian]
I have no school, I have class, I have bando at home

Leave the spell, I jump you like a kite
Hate cracks you and you don't have any anyway
