â€‹giving in Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm worn out
I hate this town
We built this house, you tore it down
My heart and soul
My flesh and bone
It was the only home I know

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sun and dust
Not much to see
But broken trust
That sticks to me
Now you're here
Can't you disappear?
'Cause it's more than I can bear
[Chorus]
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in

[Verse 2]
You pull me in
It's sink or swim
And I drowned in everything
No matter what I do
You still get through
My only sin is letting you

[Chorus]
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in

[Post-Chorus]
I'm giving in, I'm giving in, I'm giving in
I let you love me again
I'm giving in, I'm giving in, I'm giving in
I let you love me again
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm giving in, I let you love me again
I'm giving in, I let you love me again
I'm giving in, I let you love me again
I'm giving in, I let you love me again

[Chorus]
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in
Oh, don't ask me how I've been
I'm this close to giving in

[Post-Chorus]
I'm giving in, I'm giving in, I'm giving in
I let you love me again
I'm giving in

[Outro]
I'm giving in, I'm giving in, I'm giving in
I let you love me again
I'm giving in1Embed
