A century without you Lyrics [letter of "a century without you"]

[Verse 1]
A thousand and one story I have invented
To be here, here by your side
And you don't realize that (what)
I don't find what to do
I know you think I have not been sincere
I know you think I no longer have remedy
But who was going to tell me (say) that without you I don't know how to live?
[Pre-car]
And now that you are not here
I realize how much you do you do me

[Chorus]
If I have failed you, I apologize in the only way I know
Opening the doors of my heart
For when you decide to return
Because there will never anyone who can fill
The emptiness you left in me
You have changed my life, you have made me grow
I am not yesterday
One day is a century without you

[Verse 2]
A thousand and one story I have invented
To show you that I have changed
What happened happened
Let's rescue what joined us
That we all learn from our mistakes
Only I ask you to forgive me now
But who was going to tell me how difficult it is to live?

[Pre-car]
And now that you are not here
I realize how much you do you do me

If I have failed you, I apologize in the only way I know
Opening the doors of my heart
For when you decide to return
Because there will never anyone who can fill
The emptiness you left in me
You have changed my life, you have made me grow
I am not yesterday
One day is a century without you

[Interlude]
Oh

[Chorus]
Because there will never anyone who can fill
The emptiness you left in me
You have changed my life, you have made me grow
I am not yesterday

[Pre-car]
How much I miss you

[Chorus]
If I have failed you, I apologize in the only way I know
Opening the doors of my heart
For when you decide to return
Because there will never anyone who can fill
The emptiness you left in me
You have changed my life, you have made me grow
I am not yesterday
One day is a century without you
If I failed you, I ask you forgivenembed
