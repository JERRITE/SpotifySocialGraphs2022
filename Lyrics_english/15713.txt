Raining lyrics stars [lyrics of "raining stars"]

[Verse 1]
Forgive if I realize that I have not lost you
It hurts to accept that you are no longer with me
And I can't stop thinking only about you
I don't know if one day you will know that I take you with me
Life is not right or meaning and
I can die if you are not next to me

[Pre-stribe]
I am so thirst for you
What's hard for me to breathe
Or it will be that in my delirium
I love you more and more
[Chorus]
They are raining stars
In our room
They wet my heart
They are raining stars
Around me
And they ask me what was about you
What happened to you

[Verse 2]
I would like to take you very inside and the time comes
Come into the bottom of your feelings
And see if the same thing happens to me
If, when being next to him you would tell him my name
And being in his arms, my kisses hide
You remember the love nights that I gave you

[Pre-stribe]
I am so thirst for you
What's hard for me to breathe
Or it will be that in my delirium
I love you more and more

[Chorus]
They are raining stars
In our room
They wet my heart
They are raining stars
Around me
And they ask me what was about you
What happened to you
You Might Also Likey are raining stars
In our room
They wet my heart
They are raining stars
Around me
And they ask me what was about you
What happened to you, what happened
