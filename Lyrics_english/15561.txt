The Lyrics school girl [lyrics by "La Ni√±a de la School"]

[Chorus: Lola Indigo]
I am that school girl
The one you didn't like, can you remember me? (UH, NA-NA-NA)
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby (hey), oh baby" (wuh)
I am that school girl
The one you didn't like, can you remember me?
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby, oh baby" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Lola Indigo, Belinda, both]
And I know I changed, Yeah, that now you liked a lot (wuh)
I'm not the same as before
I know I changed, Yeah, why I polished my diamonds
I have enough lovers
Your ego fell-pray (ey)
You don't miss me, I have to'-to'-to
Limpiate the drool that fell to you (which fell to you)
For the first time the trick failed you (you failed you-o)
When you could not want (no)
And now that you want 'is not going to be (ah)
Now you saw me (no), you get sad (mmm)
You know what you will lose
[Chorus: Tini, Lola Indigo]
I am that school girl
The one you didn't like, can you remember me?
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby, oh baby"
I am that school girl (that girl from school)
The one you didn't like, can you remember me?
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby, oh baby"

[Verse 2: tini]
Baby, I already returned, hello
I know I'm more good, leave the show
The one that wrote you so much in school
And now that he sees me singing reggaeton
Wants to return, but not
And now I got more good, but ma 'bad
Now I will call me, it slips me
Now that toy lost like a bullet
I am dangerous, nobody matches me
And now I got more good, but ma 'bad
Now I will call me, it slips me
Now that toy lost like a bullet
I am dangerous and nobody matches me

[Chorus: Lola Indigo, Belinda]
I am that school girl
The one you didn't like, can you remember me?
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby, oh baby"
I am that school girl
The one you didn't like, can you remember me?
Now that I'm a good step and says: "Oh baby, oh baby" (uh)
