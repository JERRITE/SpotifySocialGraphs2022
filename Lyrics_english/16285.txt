Iâ€™m Going Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
We sit in the car outside your house
And I can feel the heat coming down
I go to put my arms around you
Give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Yeah, let out one of your bored sighs and
Lately when I look into your eyes
I'm going down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
We get dressed up and we go
Out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning
Burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, girl
Setting me up just to knock, knock, knock me
Down, down down
Going down, down, down, down
[Verse 3]
Pull you close but when we kiss
When we kiss I can feel the doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the mornings
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild, but
Lately girl you get your kicks just driving me down
Down, down, down, down
Going down, down, down, down...You might also likeEmbed
