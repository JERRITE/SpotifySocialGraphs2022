And when you come back asking for complicity
We will both know it, it's so natural
I felt that I had to warn you not ma-a-a-to

[Chorus: Juliana, Natalia]
What if you decide to come, baby, ouh-oh-oh
I will not take me in kissing you, Yay-Yeh, huh
My, My, My, My Baby, Ouh-Oh-Oh
You have always been for me
And if you decide to come, Baby, Ouh-Oh-Oh
I will not take me in kissing you, Yay-Yeh, huh
My, My, My, My Baby, Ouh-Oh-Oh
You have always been for me
[Verse: Olga]
Despite things
I know what you want
I tired my roses
Loves come and go
Despite things
I know what you want
I tired my roses

You have always been for me
