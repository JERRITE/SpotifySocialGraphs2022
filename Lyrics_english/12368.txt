Love Dump Lyrics[Intro: Sample]
"I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me..."
"I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me..."

[Chorus]
Hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
Really hand it to me
[Verse 1]
I've always loved you
Love dumpling
Your shit's like chocolate cake
And your ass smells like a rose

[Verse 2]
I really hate you
Love dumpling
Now my bowels ache, yeah

[Refrain: Sample]
"I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me..."

[Chorus]
Drop down in a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
Really hand it to me

Hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
