​say what’s on your mind Lyrics[Chorus]
Say what's on your mind baby
Say what's on your mind baby
I'm just doing fine without you
Say what's on your mind before I get lost

[Verse 1]
My mind is full of darkness
I'm crying 'cause you're not here but
That's fine if you gon' leave
That's fine if you don' need
That's fine I'll say goodbye anyway
[Chorus]
Say what's on your mind right now
Because I'm dying from inside
Because I'm crying to you now
Say what's on your mind right now
Because I'm dying from inside baby

[Verse 2]
Couple summers ago
In the land of the gold
You know under the bridge
We shared something old
Back then I didn't know
She was someone I owned
Turned to someone I owe
She's my one last chance
From a child to a man
A friend to a lover
From someone I met
Girl, I don't regret
Meeting you
In Beverly Hills
In Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
Say what's on your mind right now
Because I'm dying from inside
Because I'm crying to you now
Say what's on your mind right now
Because I'm dying from inside
Because I'm cryingYou might also like2Embed
