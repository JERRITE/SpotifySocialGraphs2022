I see you dance lyrics [lyrics of "I see you dance" ft. BRAY & ALEJANDRO ARMES]

[Intro: Baby Rasta & Dj Nelson]
Tu-Ru-Ru, Tu-Ru-Ru
Tu-Ru-Ru, Tu-Ru-Ru
On the disc I see you dance (Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo)
Your body I want to touch (Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo)
You cause me 'with a kiss on the mouth (Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo)
Rozo your body and asks me more (Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo, Bellaqueo)

[Verse 1: yandel]
Already with my eyes I undressed you
And how it shakes it, with Gota Gorda Sude
The note is flying in the clouds'
And you upload it without letting it fall
I do not despair of the wait (EH-EH-EH)
You are also 'enduring the beautiful (EH)
Keep treating me as if I knew me '(Oh!)
Mami, tonight I'm pairing in whatever you want '
[Chorus: Baby Rasta & Brray]
I see you dancing on the album, your body I want to play
You cause me 'with a kiss on the mouth
Rozo your body and asks me 'more
I can't take it anymore, your body wants to touch
Devour yourself in bed, until in the morning
Feel your body that makes me bad (Sheesh)

[Verse 2: brray]
Pogate that I am going to whip you, ahead and for details' (tra)
The mission cannot be aborted (EH)
Without you I'm not going to bed
Because with you I want to get up
And if I dance 'chin—, loose from my cashin
Pa 'what does' in Medellín and to 'the day' I put the swordsman (Yah)
An endless Bellaqueo
After this perreo I leave the Brothers and I send you the pin
You know 'what I am looking for and what you are looking for, I have the product (Yeah)
Well put pa 'wet the duct as pa' that you have 'to call it "aqueduct" (wuh), yeah
But without doing much lump (Nah)
You seduce me, I seduce you (ah)
I leave 'with the desire would not be fair (Yeah)
In conclusion, I gladly introduce it to you (Sheesh)

[Bridge: Yandel, Yandel & Baby Rasta]
Paste your body next to mine like this
Mommy, give me one more night, you're not going to forget me, Yeah
Paste your body next to mine like this
Just one more night, that I am not 'to forget, Yeah

[Verse 3: wisin]
Ladies, Movement Management
OKEY, BUDO, PERIRO
Capicú, arrived the frontu (tra)
Of all tasting 'like Froot Loops (tra)
She turns it on in the bamboo (Shh!)
Three in the morning, live 'the party and the attitude' (tra, tra, tra)
Bottle 'of tequila, she does not row (ey!)
Five friends (ey!) That they put a battery (ey!)
At the head of me dancing parade (bandida)
She kills the league on the well quiet album
And pa'l floor, pa'l apartment
She moves it hard and paralyzed (I don't stop ')
Baby, nobody is going to lie that stew (you know ')
Repeat everything he did again (and today does not happen)
Your body calls me (oh-oh) and I have to hit
I don't endure the desire, I want to bake (oh-oh; eh-eh)
Your body calls me (oh-oh) and I have to hit
I don't endure the desire (oh-oh), I want to burn with you
[Chorus: Yandel & Baby Rasta]
I see you dancing on the album, your body I want to play
You cause me 'with a kiss on the mouth
Rozo your body that makes me bad
I can't take it anymore, your body wants to touch
Devour yourself in bed, until in the morning
Feel your body that makes me bad

[Verse 4: gringo]
Get out that I'm going to whip you (I'm going to whip you)
Pé-Pé-Péc yourself I'm going to whip you (I'm going to whip you)
Pé-Pé-Péc yourself I'm going to whip you
(You will love more, ahead and behind)
Co-co-conceals the support 'of support (how?)
Today you will be brought to you until with the other the aborted mission '
To the dark for not you notice
With me you are will
And I don't get the speed anymore
As an operation in the rocket you will dismantle you
In your gaze I see the need
Does not go alone, Nah, with me he wanted to secure
It goes without warning to notice, so wanted
I follow the current and I don't frie
He arrived with straight hair and sweating he put curl
Give me your back to see you colored them '' the gistro
On the disc You and I in Bailoteo
I had seen you and noticed that I had 'desire
Pa'-pa'-pa 'you have all day for
You can't forget about this night, Yeah

[Chorus: Yandel & Baby Rasta]
I see you dancing on the album, your body I want to play
You cause me 'with a kiss on the mouth
Rozo your body that makes me bad
I can't take it anymore, your body wants to touch
Devour yourself in bed, until in the morning
Feel your body that makes me bad
