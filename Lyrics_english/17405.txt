One of Them Days Again Lyrics[Spoken Intro: MO3]
Yeah, I ask God to watch over me and cover me in the blood and forgive me for the blood that I put on these streets. For real

[Chorus: MO3]
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
Ooh, I'm thinkin' 'bout where I done been
Thinkin' 'bout my past relationships (My past relationships)
That's just the way it is (Huh?)
The way it is (Huh?)
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
They puttin' dirt on my name (Dirt on my name)
And I done felt so much pain (Why-y-y)
That I'm okay with it (Why-y-y-y-y)
That's just the way it is
The way it is
It's just one of them days again
[Verse 1: MO3]
I told them people 'bout MO3, put my life on them beats (For real)
Told them the bitch I love, she burned me, and had me scared to pee (She did)
1305, where I was sleep, oh we start sellin' weed (We was)
I was 16 when shit got deep, I'm shootin' shit for free
Handled all of my problems, we got 'em solved
Get up, go get 'em done
K-Rilla was catchin' them bodies
I'm like: "Damn, I gotta get me one" (What?)
Oh, Ghost, he was ready, he servin'
Straight to the money, I gotta get me some
Marquise was outta his body, he caught a cap, they gave him 60 somethin'
Murder 'bout my name, it ain't a game
Won't let you slam to that (No)
No cap on Forest Lane when Kenney Wayne wore that black fanny pack (Yeah)
Debo slingin' sexy back to back to pack, we grammin' that (For real)
Still won't get my granny back (What?)
Fuck that dope, I am the crack
Straight to the dough, runnin' after that (Oh, yeah?)
Runaway hitters, coupla killers and a poor hoe
Coupla killers get up and get it when they go
They keep thinkin' we niggas, fuck all that talkin', we gon' go
We gon' cut up a nigga, fuck who be with 'em
Get up and get 'em, won't tolerate niggas actin' like hoes (Nah)
Gunnin' my dealers, run up and get 'em, put the gun through the window
And knock everything out the back of the stroll

It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
Ooh, I'm thinkin' 'bout where I done been
Thinkin' 'bout my past relationships (My past relationships)
That's just the way it is (Huh?)
The way it is (Huh?)
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
They puttin' dirt on my name (Dirt on my name)
And I done felt so much pain (Why-y-y)
That I'm okay with it (Why-y-y-y-y)
That's just the way it is
The way it is
It's just one of them days again

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I'm not feelin' fly even though that I'm hot
I see through these niggas like mirrors
I hate what I see, where am I at, they livin' their live
I woke up kinda salty today (Man)
Couldn't even eat my Frosted Flakes
Real niggas had call aways
This what you call [?]
I made his bond, this nigga turned red (Help me, Lawd)
Took care of his son, this nigga hit my pet (Help me, Lawd)
I had five Backwoods straight, I smoked the whole pack (Help me, Lawd)
'Cause she did me like that, then she turned the bet (Told my boss)
She must ain't never loved me, 3
Never knew love 'til I met this girl
Woke up mad in this big ass bed
Man, fuck some head, I need some love
They better not fuck with me (Fuckin' diabetes)
I'm thinkin' casualties
[Chorus: MO3]
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
Ooh, I'm thinkin' 'bout where I done been
Thinkin' 'bout my past relationships (My past relationships)
That's just the way it is (Huh?)
The way it is (Huh?)
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
They puttin' dirt on my name (Dirt on my name)
And I done felt so much pain (Why-y-y)
That I'm okay with it (Why-y-y-y-y)
That's just the way it is
The way it is
It's just one of them days again

[Verse 3: MO3]
My P.O. keep askin' me shit, my lie don't sound the same (It don't)
Ada got cancer, I think she got it from smokin' like Eddie Cain (They smokin')
When I met Rayne, bitch I was strapped, the rap wasn't in my brain (It wasn't)
We sellin' CD's like crack cocaine, yo, bitch, we changed the game (Yeah)
Three baby mamas, yeah, my first one, she so solid (So solid)
My second one be in my pockets, 'cause she know I got 'em (Them dollars)
My third one, that bitch so crazy, keep my name in gossip (What?)
That's 'cause she lost, I'm tellin' them hoes: "She's weak, it's not your problem" (Yeah)
Mama say I need to chill, she got a bad feelin' (She do)
She know them shootouts I been in, she know the way I'm livin' (That's true)
But, I won't tell her I been spinnin', won't let her get in my business (What?)
I smoke that nigga, that's crucifixion, then I got to get him

[Chorus: MO3]
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
Ooh, I'm thinkin' 'bout where I done been
Thinkin' 'bout my past relationships (My past relationships)
That's just the way it is (Huh?)
The way it is (Huh?)
It's just one of them days again (One of them days, again)
They puttin' dirt on my name (Dirt on my name)
And I done felt so much pain (Why-y-y)
That I'm okay with it (Why-y-y-y-y)
That's just the way it is
The way it is
It's just one of them days again

[Outro: MO3, Boosie Badazz]
Me, my Glock and my cousins lookin' 'round tryna catch us a huss
(It's just one of them days) (Just one of them days)
Had to put down with my muscle
Now motherfuckers back sayin' I'm crazy (You know what it is)
(It's just one of them days) (Just one of them days)
Fuck Officer Friendly, bitch
Right now, I'm AK-friendly, bitch, yeah
Boosie Badazz, MO3, nigga, we got the streets, nigga
We whole lot, nigga, yeahEmbed
