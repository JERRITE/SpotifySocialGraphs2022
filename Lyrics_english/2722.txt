Nothing’s the Same Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]
You go ahead, I think I'll stay in for the winter
Can't quite remember when I even got this bitter
And how do you live like that?
So uncomplicated by the weather
In December, think I'll stay in for the winter

[Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker, Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery storе
Wondering if I've felt this way forеver
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember
[Verse 2: Alexander 23]
You go ahead, you're probably better off without me
Just take a look at all the heartbreak that surrounds me
Oh, how do you live like that?
So at peace with all the war
Whatever, like I said, you're probably better off without me

[Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember

[Bridge: Jeremy Zucker, Alexander 23, Both]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun, now we only get together

[Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever
