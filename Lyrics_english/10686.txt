Love Someone Lyrics[Chorus: Jacquees]
When you love someone (When you)
You feel that they can't do no wrong (No wrong)
I thought that you had my best interests
And you would never hurt me, no (No)
I found out you was shady, though (Shady)
I thought I was your baby, though, yeah (Your baby)
God showed me signs a thousand times
But I wouldn't let go

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Heartbreak might be the worst pain I ever felt
And I can't blame nobody but myself, yeah
I was tryna turn a jack to a king, had to play what I was dealt
I hate it even hit the point we gotta end shit
'Cause the outcome fucked up the friendship
I can tell that your interests is different
Thinkin' you can treat me like the bitches you been with
Y'all been in position, you live for attention
I'm on your team, why you get so defensive? (Don't get that)
You say I turn nothin' into big shit
Always get caught up in the slick shit
I took it personal
But I'ma carry on like a terminal
Could forget but some shit is irreversable
And tell that new ho you with I see her lurkin' on me (I see you, lil' ho)
'Cause I been that bitch
I'll straight end that shit (I'll take that shit)
I already seen the phone calls and the addy, you don't wanna make me get at sis (You don't wanna make me pull up)
The most we ain't speakin'
So long, you ain't in my recents
Love you enough to be there when you need me
But I love me enough to know when it ain't equal
[Chorus: Jacquees]
When you love someone (When you)
You feel that they can't do no wrong (No wrong)
I thought that you had my best interests
And you would never hurt me, no (No)
I found out you was shady, though (Shady)
I thought I was your baby, though, yeah (Your baby)
God showed me signs a thousand times
But I wouldn't let go

[Verse 2: Dreezy]
I had to get you up out of my system
I was losing myself, couldn't risk it, yeah
I thought I was trippin'
Had me feeling guilty when I was the victim
Whenever you say you need me, knew to call on me quick
Was your leadin' lady, you was followin' bitches
Crazy how IG hoes who not in the picture got me arguin' with you
Yeah, and you can put it all on the line for a nigga, he'll still switch
But every nigga wanna go hard, say how they on some real shit
Tellin' me to control my emotions
Never own up to the shit when you bogus
We smile for the cameras but losin' the focus
Your comments ain't matchin' the actions you showin'
Half this shit is just different
It feelin' like somethin' been missing
I gotta make my best decision
When it's said and done I'ma have to live with it
Not everybody deserve your affection
Write you a paragraph, delete the message
Everything I ever said, know I meant
Put a guard on my heart, now I gotta protect it
