Optimism in F# Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like a victim
Cryin' over a broken system
Wishin' I could trade my car, in for a new whip
Money's tight and time is a commodity
A little bad luck and I cross the line to poverty
My car's dying and deaths are compounding
Swimming the line and treading water and drowning

[Chorus]
But hey
It's all going to be fine
I put worries out my mind
I always must remind myself
The struggle is divine
Society draws lines
But they not how one define
Relax and give it time
It's all going to be fine
[Verse 2]
Truth is, I'm prone to depression
But a life spent coping has taught me a lesson
Happiness can't be bought or given
Despite what is missing
It's a life worth livin'

[Verse 3]
The billion cells all working together as one
Create the warmth that you feel
When you step into the sun
Our existence is a complete phenomenon
So whatever you're stressin' pales in comparison

[Verse 4]
Live a life following where you're heart leads you
Not mimicking charades displayed on social media
Forget the values society feeds you
There's no right or wrong
It's just whatever completes you

[Chorus]
And hey
It's all going to be fine
I put worries out my mind
I always must remind myself
The struggle is divine
Society draws lines
But they are not how one define
Relax and give it time
It's all going to be fineYou might also likeEmbed
