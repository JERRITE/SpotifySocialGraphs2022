Bleed for Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been hanging 'round
With an enemy of the state
Come with me to the building
That no one stops to watch

[Chorus]
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
Bleed for me
[Verse 2]
We'll strap you to a pipe
Electrodes on your balls
C'mon scream, c'mon writhe
Face down in a pool of piss

[Chorus]
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
Bleed for me

[Bridge]
In the name of world peace, in the name of world profits
America pumps up our secret police
America wants fuel, to get it, it needs puppets
So what's ten million dead if it's keeping out the Russians?
We're well-trained by the CIA
With Yankee tax money in Ft. Bragg
The Peace Corps builds us labor camps
When they think they're building schools, ha!
When cowboy Ronnie comes to town
Forks out his tongue at human rights
Sit down, enjoy our ethnic meal
Dine on some charbroiled nuns, try a medal on
Smile at the mirror as the cameras click
And make big business happy
You might also like[Verse 3]
Anytime
Anywhere
Maybe you'll
Just disappear!

[Chorus]
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
Bleed!1Embed
