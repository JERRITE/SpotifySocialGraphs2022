Happy Belated Lyrics[Verse 1: Derek Wise]
Got it tattooed on my mind, I ain't got hit by no luck
Double crossed a hundred times, that's why it's so hard for me to love
Got these karats on me cryin', I'm attractin' all these doves
And when I'm off that drink, I put my Patek in the glove, yeah
I poured that in my sink, I put that Perky on my tongue, and
And niggas with the shits won't come outside without a drum, been
Been runnin' through these bitches but they act like they some nuns
When she look inside the mirror she like, "Who did I become?"
Ain't no backtrackin', I'm forward when I'm sittin' in that Porsche
Nothin' I can't afford when I'm shopping in these stores
Yeah, my bitch built like a stallion, I fuck her like a horse
Now we penthouse at the Ritz, used to sleepin' on these floors
[Chorus: 88 Camino]
I just pour my drink and think about you when it's done
Icin' like a rink, I had to tell you summer's done
It's gettin' hard to think, that's how I know I jumped the gun
Drippin' like a sink, I got a pocket full of ones
Tryna be polite but I'm sayin' what's real
I keep eatin' these Xannies but I still pop Seals
Icin' her back with the pipe but she still pop up
Told her it was for the night but she still caught feels

[Verse 2: 88 Camino]
Heard they talking 'bout us now
Speakin' on my name like we related
Cartier bracelet buss down (Cartier bracelet buss down)
She throwing me the cake, happy belated (Racked out)
I'm still pullin' my map up (Map up)
Baby girl, where you at though?
I keep blowin' her back out (Back out), yeah
We don't need niggas to back us (Back us)
Big ol' body, it back up (Back up)
Smack it down 'tll she tap out
You the same niggas had tracks with us (Tracks with us)
These days I don't flex enough (Flex enough)
Baby girl, come get racks with us (Racked out, racked out)
Young nigga pourin' his last up, Adderall got me gassed up
You might also like[Chorus: 88 Camino]
I just pour my drink and think about you when it's done
Icin' like a rink, I had to tell you summer's done
It's gettin' hard to think, that's how I know I jumped the gun
Drippin' like a sink, I got a pocket full of ones
Tryna be polite but I'm sayin' what's real
I keep eatin' these Xannies but I still pop Seals
Icin' her back with the pipe but she still pop up
Told her it was for the night but she still caught feelsEmbed
