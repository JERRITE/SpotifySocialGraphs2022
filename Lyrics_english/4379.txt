If I die tomorrow Lyrics [letter from "if I die tomorrow"]

[Intro]
Hear This
Hear This

[Chorus: Ñejo]
If I die tomorrow, I don't want them to cry
Nor buy me flowers, you better go to bacillate
What a lot I have fucked up, I look for a fifty lyos
And I am not a holy to put you 'to cry
That if tomorrow you die, I'm going for the album
To bacillate with the songs you liked to dance
Tell Dad God that if he sends me to look for me
That if I can stay another little while
That I want to stay another little while

[Verse 1: ñejo]
And if something happens to me, tell my ma'i that I don't suffer
That I was not a saint, who better gives him a bank
That when I die I am well hit
To check the account, that it is supposed to leave a few
And they tell the Doña that you always remember me
Every time you get on a bow
But since I have not died, I'm still alive and cooling
We will continue hesitation, drinking and smoking
But do things right, I don't look at who
For the living greeting, dead for resting in peace, amen
Traveling the whole world in a steel bird
They bury me from Hector's, and listen to how I want it

[Bridge: Dalmatian]
If tomorrow is exhausted, my life already lived
See my children, and give them my farewell
If tomorrow touches me, see and tell them the old
That I will continue to love them but from the other life
You Might Also Like [chorus: ñejo]
And if death comes to look for me
Tell him to come later
And it's not that I am a coward
But it really wanted to stay

And if death comes to look for me
Tell him to come later
And it's not that I am a coward
But it really wanted to stay

[Verse 2: Dalmatian]
Li-li-life is good, but very short
Sooner or later to 'the world touches him
Sure is the farewell, there is no doubt
Since welcome little hard time, hard
Disease without cure, it is born to live
You live for dying after
That in life I have to take advantage
Before death come to look for me, for that

[Pre-car: Dalmatian]
I live today
In case I die tomorrow
As if it were the last
I live today
In case I die tomorrow
As if it were the last

[Chorus: Ñejo]
If I die tomorrow, I don't want them to cry
Nor buy me flowers, you better go to bacillate
What a lot I have fucked up, I look for a fifty lyos
And I am not a holy to put you 'to cry

That if tomorrow you die, I'm going for the album
To bacillate with the songs you liked to dance
Tell Dad God that if he sends me to look for me
That if I can stay another little while
That I want to stay another little while
That I want to stay another little while

[Bridge: Dalmatian]
If tomorrow is exhausted, my life already lived
See my children, and give them my farewell
If tomorrow touches me, see and tell them the old
That I will continue to love them but from the other life

[Outro: Ñejo, Dalmatian]
Already, now
This is the Ñejo with the Dalmatian
Or the Dalmatian with the Ñejo
Haze, fine
