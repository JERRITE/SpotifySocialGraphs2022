Chaos {REMASTERED} WITH LYRICS (Sonic.Exe FNF Mod) LyricsAct S - Chaos

(Fleetway Super Sonic)
I will push your absolute limit

(BF)
You really think you can push me to the limit? I am not slow!
You’re super sonic, but I'll show you just how fast I can really go

(FSS)
You are a snail to me, get out of my way, I will end you!
You say you're fast, but prove it by keeping up to my super tune
(BF)
Ask the others, they can tell you how fast I really am
You might've been the fastest, but there is someone new on these horror lands

(FSS)
EAT THIS!

LIAR!! You can never compare to my speed

(BF)
Why are you making this game unfair to me?

(FSS - BF in background)
Ok, I'll stop, will make you drop, unleash chaos in this face-off
(I don't need this)

Heh, come on, suck it up!

(BF)
Lеmme show you, power, greatеr than you can handle

(FSS)
I can handle, all of your ramble

(BF - SFS in background)
You can see
Obsolete
Just retreat
You just gotta have some more speed
(You're too slow)
You might also like(FSS)
HA HA HA HA

I have enough speed

(BF)
Please, Prove it to me

(FSS)
Ok, you'll see

(BF)
Ok, show me

(FSS)
Don't you dare trick me

(BF)
That, won’t be cheating

(Both)
I'm so much quicker than you'll ever be

(BF)
I’m super speedy
(FSS)
You are right, that's me

(BF)
What do you mean

(FSS)
I am winning

(BF)
Stop your wishing

(FSS)
I'm finishing

(BF - SFS in background)
Ok, now, stop your lying mouth
(TOO SLOW!)

(FSS)
I'm Fleetway Super Sonic, isn't that very ironic
That I came to take you down and win without hesitation

(BF)
I'm Boyfriend, my name's funny, I see you that are a dummy
I haven't unleashed my power, to keep you safe like the flowers

(FSS)
You're finished

You are not winning against me anytime soon so beat it
You wouldn't like if I yelled "INTRUDERS" like the speakers did
You are finally gonna feel pain, when I beat you in this game
You'll no longer rise to fame, you'll now live in eternal flame

(BF)
Ok, I'm tired, of you're yelling, so can you quiet
I think it's time that I exclaim "CHAOS" just to prove that...
Just to show you that I'm super, just a sneak peak, just a blooper
Of my power, You are too slow, Stupid coward, forever, I'll go

(FSS)
WHAT?!

Ok, pushing me to my limit

(Super BF)
Told you, I'm the winner, admit it!

(FSS)
Ok, I didn't know that singing would unleash your true power

(SBF)
I killed your fame, its finishing, into nothing, going downward

(FSS)
GRRRR

Ok, one more time, and then I'm done!

(SBF)
Give me more. I wanna have some fun!

(FSS)
Oh ok, now lemme go full!

(SBF - FSS in background)
You're words, they better not be dull
Do not let you power dwindle
With these words, I'mma gonna fiddle
(AHHHHHHH, NOW I'LL SHOW YOU!!!)

(FSS - SBF in background)
You're just gonna become slower
I'm gonna keep moving forward
It's like when I step on flowers
Just like that you'll lose your power

This is the game you create
In a few you're gonna break
Then you're gonna lose your date
They will put her on their plate

(This is more like it
This is what I wanted, a nice hit
Break silence!
You are still too slow
I got it, go!)

(SBF - FSS in background)
I'mma go faster, keep up my power
You're a disaster, beat you with my words
You are just a faker man, moving faster cause I can
You're tryna manipulate, I know how to keep a date

I'mma slow down, going hyper
Pooped yourself? You need a diaper?
Ok, that was fun, want more?
Now I'm done, get off the floor

(What are you saying?
Your words are inaudible to me
Wha- you're the king
I am going crazy)

(FSS)
AHHHH

How'd you do that?

(SBF)
I'm built to rap

(FSS)
What do you mean?

(SBF)
Don't see defeat

(FSS)
You're just cheating

(SBF)
Still not believing?

(Together)
I can't deal with this, wanna leave

(SBF)
Can you not see me?

(FSS)
No depleting?!

(SBF)
My power grows

(FSS)
You kept the flow

(SBF)
That comes to show

(FSS)
I'm pretty slow

(SBF)
You got it Bingo
I keep my lingo

(FSS)
GRR
I'm getting tired of your lies
You must die and meet your demise
But you are cheating, I'm getting heated
I'm not fleeting, faced defeat

(SBF)
I'm bullying, I should stop it
You can quit your act, just drop it
If you didn't know you lost it
Your speed it'll never click

(FSS)
UGH, Shut up!

I am tired of you continuing to make it past me
I just need you to back down, so I can reign in victory

(SBF - FSS in background)
There was no reason to fighting me, because you knew the cost
But it turned out because I tried hard enough, it made it so you lost!
(I lost!!!!)Embed
