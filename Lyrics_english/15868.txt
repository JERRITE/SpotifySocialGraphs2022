[Intro]
Shiny, twinkling
Eyes like ships sinking into the waters
So attractive, I almost immersed me

[Chorus]
But I don't like gold fever, gold fever
I don't like anticipating my blush face
I don't like anyone to die for feeling your touch
Everyone wishes you
Everyone wonders what to love you
Rapid
I don't like the slow camera, double vision in a pink blush
I don't like falling, how to fly until the bones break
Everyone wishes you
But I don't like a gold fever
[Verse 1]
How should it be beautiful?
With your hair falling instead like domsós
I see myself walking gently on your wooden floors
With my Eagles shirt hanging from the door
In the dinners, I confront you for your opposite shit
And the coastal city for which we wandered had never seen a love as pure as this
And then fades in the gray of my tea a day ago
Because it could never be

[Chorus]
But I don't like gold fever, gold fever
I don't like anticipating my blush face
I don't like anyone to die for feeling your touch
Everyone wishes you
Everyone wonders what to love you
Rapid
I don't like the slow camera, double vision in a pink blush
I don't like falling, he feels like flying until the bones break
Everyone wishes you
But I don't like a gold fever

[Verse 2]
How should it be beautiful?
With your hair falling instead as dominated
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you
In the dinners I will not call you for your opposite shit
And the coastal city that we never found will never see a love as pure as this
Because it fades in the gray of my tea of ​​a day
Because it will never be
