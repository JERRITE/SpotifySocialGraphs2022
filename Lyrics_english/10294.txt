Take Me With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hear it first in my head
See us spinning like a silhouette
Like dreamers chase a world beyond
I taste your taste, I sing your song

[Verse 2]
I need to know, need to know
Swear to me you're not a ghost
Through paradise or hell you know
[Pre]
You can go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
You can go on, go on, go on, go on, go on

[Chorus]
Just take me with you
Take me with you, take me with you, take me with you

[Verse 3]
Your love is like a waterfall
Crashing down so wonderful
I just want you to know

[Pre]
You can go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
You can go on, go on, go on, go on, go on

[Chorus]
Just take me with you
Take me with you, take me with you, take me with you

[Bridge]
Face to face, midnight glow
Tracing patterns in the sky below
Like dreamers chase a world beyond
I taste your taste, I sing your song
You might also like[Chorus]
Take me with you, take me with you
I sing your song, take me with, take me with you

[Chorus]
Just take me with you
Take me with you, take me with you, take me with you
Take me with you, take me with you, take me with you
Take me with you2Embed
