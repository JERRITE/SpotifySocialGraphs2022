Arise Lyrics[Verse 1]
... Obscured by, obscured by, obscured by, obscured by, obscured
Obscured by the sun
Apocalyptic clash
Cities fall in ruin
Why must we die?

[Chorus]
Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall arise
[Verse 2]
I did nothing, saw nothing
Terrorist confrontation
Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy

[Bridge]
I see the world, old (Old)
I see the world, dead (Dead)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Last wish, fatality
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

[Verse 4]
Face the enemy
Manic thoughts
Religious intervention
Problems remain

[Chorus]
Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall ariseYou might also likeEmbed
