Sun Came Up Lyrics[Intro]
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance

[Verse 1]
Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up and we're still dancing together
[Verse 2]
The water was still and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up we were still dancing together
(Together, together, together, together)

[Chorus]
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance
When the sun came up

[Verse 1]
Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up and we're still dancing together

[Verse 2]
The water was still and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up we were still dancing together
You might also like[Chorus]
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
And you and I dancing to the sound of their breathing

[Post-Chorus]
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance and then
When you and I dance
When the sun came up

[Verse 1]
Suddenly my eyes are seeing you clearly
I think I'm nearly back where we were
When the sun came up and we're still dancing together

[Verse 2]
The water was still and the people were sleeping
You and I dancing to the sound of their breathing
When the sun came up we were still dancing together1Embed
