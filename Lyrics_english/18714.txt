Revolution Is My Name Lyrics[Verse 1]
'68 into the world born
And the Seventies, a breath after the war
Life was confusing because of my age
Should my eyes open for tomorrowâ€™s gains?
I can't help the way I am
There's no trust and there's no end
What is my name?

[Chorus 1]
It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name
[Verse 2]
From now on, can't look the other way
Keep in mind and listen to what I say
Take under wing all the ones who are lost
Build up around them an infinite wall
Don't you know just who I am?
Take the hand of wisdom's friend
What is my name?

[Chorus 2]
It's time to change
It can't stay the same
Revolution is my name

[Chorus 1]
It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name

[Bridge]
What is my name?
What is my name?
What is my name?
What is my name?
Forever
What is my name?
What is my name?
What is my name?
What is my name?
Revolution
