Lyrics [for "Biladerim" for TranslationsenglishiLederim]

[Verse 1]
Folding, folding at any moment
From Zero, Fero, Hero, Bro Åžakkadanak
Before Trap Time Passed Always Shaking (Trap)
Don't look back, don't look "I can't look" (Let's Go)
Not to the figure, give it a feat
When the fero enters, the beats are burning
My mass loves me too
Don't shrink a fuck here
I don't know the press, the tube, your midin
I pass syllables, listens to the regiment
I choose the target, pimler in my hand
I get out of a day, I don't get down for a lifetime
My acceleration rises, I don't get off
My songs recur and moan in the ears like hernia
The batteries are not over suddenly (no, no)
Bin Nigga on my train, don't be afraid of iron
[Chorus]
For Biladerim (Biladerim)
For my niggers (for my niggers)
For brothers (brother, brother)
For brothers (for brothers)
Not fame, for money
For my hip-hop brothers
For this rap biladerim
Trap of Negroes
Brother brother for bilader and niggers
Find as a competitor something
You know us too, muscles that form nigga
I have trap music disease work
Disease work, disease work
He enthusiastic, not interest, this is a disease job
For my mother, for my father and for my chick
I'm doing this job for my bilaze

[Verse 2]
For my biladerim, of course, my neighborhood Rich (Rich)
If I give up my bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard (bastard)
Both hard and funny, you are trouble
I don't give five, come on fuck (go)
I ate lyricalite ulan (hah)
Fero Nigga Lan (Lan)
It doesn't understand, my slice or something
Snake Nigga on my neck, Badiye Continue (Bass)
Lamborghini, Gucci My Man Keisan (Bro)
Who is in Ronaldinho, I Neymar (GOAL)
I'm going out like half, I'm gonna huh (trap house)
Henny-Henny-Hennenessy My Head Leyla (KIYAK)
I never say: "I don't come." (Ya)
I become the multiplication, I say woe (woe, woe, woe, woe)
Alas, alas, hey mashallah
Kei gave me joy, believe me
My teachers at school, illallah
They are proud now, Yallah
A second fero is hard, let's hope
I will represent the neighborhood Evelalah
I love this music, above God
Forest Laws Bilader, thank you
