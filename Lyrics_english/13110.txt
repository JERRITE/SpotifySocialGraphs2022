Birch Tree Lyrics[Verse 1]
The city I was born in
I left a long time ago
And we lost touch
Grew apart my friend
My heart's an old pole dancer
Troubled romancer, you know
It's a subway chancer
A question with no answer

[Chorus]
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows
[Verse 2]
And when we age
Shed our skin and grow
We shed our layers
Spread our wings and go
My heart's an old black panther
Corrupted financer, you know
It's a troubled romancer
A question with no answer

[Chorus]
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

[Chorus]
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

[Interlude]
Ooooh, oooooh
(Yeah) Ooooh
(Yeah) Ooooh

Oh now the river runs away but I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)
Oh now the river runs away when I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)

[Chorus]
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

[Outro]
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
Oh now the river runs away when I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it4Embed
