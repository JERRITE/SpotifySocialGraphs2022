â€‹do u even miss me at all? Lyrics[Intro: Gianni DiBernado]
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Gianni DiBernado]
Do you even miss me at all?
When I post that video of women on my Snapchat
Only really tryna get a way to see you call
But do you even miss me at all?
'Cause I need that thing from you
Like I'm the only one in this game for two
Hoped that you would be there when I fall
[Chorus: Gianni DiBernado]
But do you even miss me at all?
Do you even miss me at all?
Do you even miss me at all?
'Cause I need that thing from you
Like I'm the only one in this game for two
Hoped that you would be there when I fall
But do you even miss me at all?

[Verse 1: Kyle Devore]
Yeah, girl you say you love me
Then you go behind my back saying fuck me (Skrr)
Coulda gave your ass the world, and you lucky
Used to say there was "No one else above me"
(But I can't get a text back, though)
Girl, I used to love you
Now all the shit you doin' make it hard to trust you
Stab me in the back, know it cut deep
You saying "Fuck me," I'm saying "Fuck you" (Ooh)
All your history, I don't wanna know that
See me on IG, askin' where the hoes at
I can have another you by the morning
Used to kill the pussy, go and get a toe tag
Aye fuck it, tell me don't you love it
Once you leave bitches chasing cause' the way I run it
High-key, coulda made you wifey
One of one, no one else like me (Ooh)

[Chorus: Gianni DiBernado]
Do you even miss me at all?
Do you even miss me at all?

But do you even miss me at all?

[Verse 2: Kyle Devore & Gianni DiBernado]
Girl, we had plans
Then you cut me out, I don't really understand
Used to be all about the romance
Now I steady wonder if you're with another man, 'cause I
Stay buggin' bout' the things you do
Forgettin' everything that we've been throughBut do you need me, like I need you?
Don't tell me that you care about me if it ain't true

[Chorus: Kyle Devore & Gianni DiBernado]
Do you even miss me at all?
When I post that (Post that) video of women on my snapchat (Baby)
Only really tryna get a way to see you call
Do you even miss me at all?
Cause' I need that thing from you
Like I'm the only one in this game for two
Hope that you'd be there when I fall
[Chorus: Gianni DiBernado]
Do you even miss me at all? (Do you miss me baby?)
Do you even miss me at all? (I gotta know, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
Do you even miss me at all?
Cause' I need that thing from you
Like I'm the only one in this game for two
Hope that you'd be there when I fall but
Do you even miss me at all?6Embed
