Rock to My Roll LyricsI know there’s got to be
More to life than smoking weed
Getting off and getting by
You are
The rhythm to my rhyme
And you are
My radio
Turn you up when I feel low
You are
The soundtrack to all I know
[Chorus]
You are the rock to my roll
My roll
My roll
You are the rock to my roll
My roll
My roll
You are the rock to my roll

Roll my heart high up my sleeve
I’ll let you roll it up for me
Who needs money when
Love is gold?

[Chorus]

So now we are singing, it keeps our hearts beating entwined
Skeletons dancing, our bones are romancing tonight
Tonight
We come alive at night

[Chorus]

You’re the anchor to my soul
My soul
My soul
You are the rock to my roll
My roll
My roll
You are the rock to my
RollYou might also likeEmbed
