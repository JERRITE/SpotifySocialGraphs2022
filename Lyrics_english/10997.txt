Syrup & Honey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't you be wasting all your money
On syrup and honey
Because I'm sweet enough
Don't you be using every minute
On making a living
Because we got our love

[Chorus]
Listen to me
One, two, three
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me
[Verse 2]
Don't you be out all night long
Leaving me all alone
Because I, I need your love
Don't you be spending every day
Working away
Because I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]
Listen to me
One, two, three
Baby, baby, baby
Spend your time on me

[Outro]
Spend it, spend it, spend it
Your time on me
Please, baby
Mmm
Please, babyYou might also likeEmbed
