Very crazy (Challenge Remix) Lyrics [Lyrics for "well crazy (Challenge Remix)" ft. Nio García, Gigolo and La Exce, Cauty, Casper Magic & Onyx touches the piano]

[Intro: the exce & Ñengo Flow]
Remix
To the '3 a.m. No one knows who is who (EEH)
Because in the dark it is not seen (the exce)
And I am very crazy (very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
Almost losing the focus
I walk crazy
With a round pair 'in the coconut (very crazy)
[Pre-car: Jory Boy]
'Taba border on and with his mini-mini killed
It seems that she likes her and that looks
And speaking of course I did not fantastate
I came and stuck

[Chorus: Jory Boy]
And no 'fuimo' crazy
(And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'
(Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'

[Verse 1: Ñengo Flow]
LOL
I broke it, I kissed her, I grabbed her (huh)
Without fear I devoured her and now I don't stop thinking
Is that my mind machine (what I do to do when I see you)
I want you the same thing looking for '
Don't you want Bellaqueo? It doesn't look you '
(There is no na 'to forgive, but it doesn't make me fall in love'
Smoke
My machine machine and malice classes me
Volleyball 'very short where the radar does not see us
It also has me 'crazy and my body wishes you
You are going to see when you see you

In a corner of the disc
I saw her dancing alone in the couple '(Yeah)
And I said: "That is what E '"
And speaking of course I did not fantant, without fear I stuck
Bella-Bellaqueo
Mommy, you know 'I wish you
Oh, 'Tá blessed', I don't know what 'Tá Lucía' has to
Today you will enjoy the came '(there is no break-break)

[Verse 2: nova the threat]
Oohh!
I caught her and did not fantastate
You let yourself take, baby, in a do 'by tre', so that E '
Corre me the machine, see
Make me a striptea, "give it, lose upside down
And well crazy with Onyx Rompimo 'The scheme'
And pusimo 'to be brought to the baby'
Sonamo 'on the street, school' and in the whole world
And control 'a' the ass' in the pupo
I'm going to spend a lot of cash, and I'm with my combi versace
And she gets excited when she sees that digital is my dash
If she looks at me and tells me: "Don's Worry" when I drink midori
Who likes Nova and Jory (haha) crazy

[Chorus: Jory Boy]
And no 'fuimo' crazy
(And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'
(Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'
[Verse 3: gigolo & casper magic]
Pupu, I put the back
The hand in the stop 'with my drink on his back
You quiet (-quila), he has' who supports you
It has no suit, but it is in miniskirt
'Tá dancing, an abuse, what did he do? I don't know
What does its touch, change 'the' pose '(pose')
All night she drinking champagne
And the ran-kankan-kankankan sounds
And you well crazy and I am very crazy
Spending a crazy night
Tremendous crazy (we 'somo' the magic ', baby)
Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy (casper!)

[Verse 4: Magic casper]
Ah, on the album well locote
Behind a baby, crazy with his culot
Hoping that the .10 exploit (ah)
And she asking the DJ to put the "you boté" (prr)
The husband left him, he threw him out to hell (pa'l hell)
Now he is loose, drinking well for down (down)
He passes with the friends ', from the ass going up photo'
Looking for the sponsor because the cat is broken (prr)
Since I arrived at the album (to the disc), I saw it border well Lucia '
Because she has a new ass, her friend told her (she said)
The tit was also made ', that's why she was growing' (Ajá)
Because I had a kitten, but she kept it (casper!)

[Verse 5: Exce]
Cut me in reverse, you are not healthy, you ere 'perverse
You are not 'drinking and I vice versa
They taught you more than the account
He blames alcohol when he doesn't remember '
When he arrived 'on the album, he opens the Eveybody (YEAH-YEAH)
In a candid corner 'La Mari (Yeah)
The only thing that is seen e 'the cherry (yeah)
Champagne is going down a tsunami
The e-

[Chorus: Jory Boy, Ñengo Flow & Both]
And no 'fuimo' crazy
(And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'
(Very crazy, very crazy, very crazy)
My machine, no 'fuimo' crazy
And very crazy, very crazy, very crazy
I came and stuck, and against the wall ', -e'-e'-e'

[Verse 6: Nio García]
(Child!)
And I carry it for the dark
And I hit the wall '(against the wall')
I am like a .40 without insurance
And I shot him that ass
Her friend told me that she came, she has the body like Patricia Corcino
And I lose everything as in a casino (eh-eh)
With that miniskirt he killed, and that e 'his destiny (Yeah)
At the run, he wants to smoke, this does not ruin (Yeah-Yeah)
Whenever I walk crazy he gets carried away
And always beautiful 'capsuleando (eh)
She with her 'friends wants to kiss
The devil is seen that e 'of the other side
Whenever I walk crazy he gets carried away
And always beautiful 'capsulendo
She with her 'friends wants to kiss
The devil is seen that e 'of the other side

[Verse 7: Cauty]
Young Cauty
Very crazy, the album and 'capestra' (hah)
Leave the blablablá, double and trac (chi-chi, there are)
Since he entered college '
Now you wear squeez
It seems good with baby face (OUH)
I believed anyone (ey)
I cheated on me until I found her
Well crazy, beautiful in the couple '(ah-hah)
Pa 'La Loquera has a private one
That is why he posts and does not worry, and 'path daughter'Eputa

And to the 'twenty -twenty I put them for you, what brinque', Yeah

Jory told me he won by law
Very crazy on the album you gave me the break (yes)
To your throne you need a king (oh)
Lyrics, I know that you take 'the track' and the riot '(ha ha)
Rock whiskey, you don't drink Madra '(PRR)
A beautiful that with this does not aquer you '
And I dumped do 'endo, I smoked pHillie' (pHillie 'torque')
