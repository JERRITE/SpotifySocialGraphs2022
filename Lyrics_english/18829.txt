We Rock Lyrics[COMPANY]
'Cause we rock
We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock on

[PEGGY AND TESS]
Come as you are, you're a superstar

[SANDER AND ELLA]
World in your pocket and you know it
[BARRON AND ENSEMBLE]
You can feel that beat running through your feet

[NATE AND JASON]
Heart's racing fast, you're rock and rollin'

[SHANE AND MITCHIE]
All that you need is the music to take you
To some other place
Where you know you belong

[COMPANY]
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice, following our dreams
'Cause we rock (We rock!)
We rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go, well, the better we sound
'Cause we rock (We rock!)
We rock, we rock on

(We rock, we rock, we rock on)
(We rock, we rock, we rock on)

[PEGGY AND TESS]
We're finally letting go, losin' all control

To some other place
Where you know you belong
