Feel Fwesh Lyrics[Verse]
Oh me, oh my
So flee, so fly
Lookin' at me (Oh, ya)
Lookin' at me (Oh, ya)
Oh ya, I feel fwesh
And she's dressed to impress, yeah
First I made her undress
Then I made a mess on your baby mama's chest
Tell her clean up, I got green up
Got my cream up, gotta get my dean up
Colder than an iced cappuccino (Oh, yeah)
And I fucked a half Fillipino
Met her at my show, she was dancing like a ho, yeah
Had to let her know, she was coming to my hotel, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
