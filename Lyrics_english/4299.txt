I already know Lyrics [letter from "I know"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 Came the doors on the face 
 Pass me with another in front 
 Grít me not with your eyes 
 To see if I stop loving you 
 Get me to tell me that you don't love me 
 To be very clear 
 To see if on all walls 
 I stop writing "I need you" 
 [Chorus] 
 I already know, even if I cry, ask you and implore you 
 You're not going to return 
 I already know, but to my heart how the hell I understand 
 I already know that even if you don't love me I will always remember you 

 [Post-car] 
 Look at me 
 Tell me that although I ask you, I cry you 
 I pray and implore you 
 You're not going to return 

 [Bridge] 
 A-aay! 
 Click Pelón! 

 [Chorus] 
 I already know, even if I cry, ask you and implore you 
 You're not going to return 
 I already know, but to my heart how the hell I understand 
 I already know that even if you don't love me I will always remember you 

 [Outro] 
 Look at me 
 Tell me that although I ask you, I cry you 
 I pray and implore you 
 You will not return Might Also Likeembed
