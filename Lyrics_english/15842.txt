I would like some desire to take me to the past, oh yeah (past; oh yeah)
Where from that year 'I was not fought' (fought '; uh, uh)
Because I can't settle if I'm not by your side (side)
I feel a coward for having moved away (-do)
And I feel that in my life I was a damn tarado (uh, uh)
[Chorus: Paulo Londra, Justin Quiles & De la Ghetto]
Hey, because now I only think about you
And now I can't sleep (no, no, no, no)

Teaching the 'buttock' with coconut oil

Tell me what e 'what needs to be done
E 'I can't calm this thirst (nah!)

[Verse 3: Paulo Londra]
A girl who does novel (Eah)
When it happens, it leaves me sequelae (Eah)
And I look at her, I can't deny that I want to spend a night with her (oh, oh, woh)
And I don't know how to do to tell him that (to tell him that)
I can't forget it and- (I want!)
I want to tell you that I need (say; -ce lack)
Not only a weekend, but to'a the week (to'a the week)
It's amazing how it kills me (-ta)
How can you only with your gaze (Eah)
She doesn't dream of a castle
Dream of something more complicated
See movies and eat a thousand doritos
With a man who is not a tarado
That's why I came by his side
Despite being a distrustful
Because I know that she also went through the same thing that had happened to me, Yeah
[Verse 4: from the ghetto & Paulo Londra]
(Yeah)
Baby, I know that you want '
Do it again with me
Always' you go in my mind
I don't know what Cupid made me
What you did to me is something I never forget
You forget the past, be together 'is the destination
And I always think (I think)
I'm going to have you here again (again)
To do so as in the 'old' time '(Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
I want to take possession of your body
But I look for you and I don't find you
And I always think (I think)
I'm going to have you here again (again)
To do so as in the 'old' time '(Yeh, Yeh, Yeh)
I want to take over your body (wuh, ey; yes)
But I look for you and I don't find you
