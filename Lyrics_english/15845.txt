You and I Lyrics [letter from "you and me" ft. WBMS]

[Pre-stribe: bad Kinder]
You couldn't change me, there was no solution
You never trust me, I have no heart
I rob what I don't have
That's why I have to steal your heart
And now that I have it
I'm going to break it in pieces, I'm your curse

[Chorus: bad Kinder]
You and I find ourselves like that suddenly
It was not love, it was like an accident
That's what people tell me
I was unconscious
You and I find ourselves like that suddenly
It was not love, it was like an accident
That's what people tell me
I was unconscious
[Post-stribe: bad Kinder]
And if you come tonight, with me you will die
You will shout "help" but nobody will come
You will beg to stop but I'm going to continue
Playing with ours although that can hurt you
And if you come tonight, with me you will die
You will shout "help" but nobody will come
You will beg to stop but I'm going to continue
Playing with ours although that can hurt you

[Verse 1: bad Kinder]
Because you just want to be with me (with me)
Because you know that the bad is fun
And I am the worst, and I don't know, maybe
Let's look tonight and kill us both
I don't know if it's the best, it's a mistake
But when I'm with you I feel the best

[Chorus: bad Kinder]
You and I find ourselves like that suddenly
It was not love, it was like an accident
That's what people tell me
I was unconscious
You and I find ourselves like that suddenly
It was not love, it was like an accident
That's what people tell me
I was unconscious

That's why I have to steal your heart

[Chorus: bad Kinder]
You and I find ourselves like that suddenly
It was not love, it was like an accident
That's what people tell me
I was unconscious
