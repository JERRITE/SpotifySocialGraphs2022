The Color Violet Lyrics[Verse 1]
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a barbie marking X on the dot (Uh)
She calls my phone up but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, 1-5-5, with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I've waited for my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my hеart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, wе don't dance, dance, dance
[Chorus]
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, play games of love all on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first
But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
You might also like[Chorus]
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh10Embed
