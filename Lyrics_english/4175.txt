Lyrics moments ["Moments" ft letter. Cosculluela]

[Chorus: cosculluela]
What if I fell in love? I don't know
I just know you left me
Here, just thinking 24/7
I don't get you out of my mind
How to deny you?
If in me, you achieved
That although I am with another
I can not forget
[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world

[Verse 1: cosculluela]
Mommy, when you are in my arms, I feel like a superhero
I can touch the cloud while you move
Above me, triple x in repeat
I had a boyfriend, but for me, Braa, Delete
The sheets are Louis
PA-PA SCOBY DOOBY
Hard without making tits or booty
Kardashian, my ass is thrown out 'and they don't get caught
So many chapters do me
Without presidential, mommy, I don't have to border you
But I like giving you the sea
I don't want to fall in love, but if you fall in love I don't care
How do I want, I can't start
Those moments Baby

[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world

Baby, you get on like torch
When the bottle goes down
We get pa 'under the quilt
If you want, the area watched us ''
And Sacamo 'A passage pa' Italia
In the Gucci I buy you the portfolios and to'as the sandals
That booty does not fit in 'the jean
Mommy, do you put 'the gym?
It seems that you did it in Medell√≠n
With me, you are made
But you have to walk right
Pa 'ti, I am available any date

[Verse 2: Bryant Myers]
I don't know if this is something right or if I'm going to be wrong
But for the moment, I want to enjoy it
What I feel for you, is increasing more
I don't know if we are going well or if we will end bad
We stayed 'in South Beach or Ocean Park
Let's go to spend
Your lips are the ones I like to kiss
I can't resist when it starts' to play
With you, I don't care about the time or the place

[Chorus: cosculluela]
What if I fell in love? I don't know
I just know you left me
Here, just thinking twenty -four seven
I don't get you out of my mind
How to deny you?
If in me, you achieved
That although I am with another
I can not forget
[Chorus: Bryant Myers]
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world
Those moments when we are together
Baby, I feel that flight outside this world
