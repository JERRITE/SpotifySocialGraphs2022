In her lyrics [letter of "in hers"]

[Intro: Jhayco & Feid]
One night I can't forget
And even if you have to escape
To work I will get
Pichar to 'the text' and the cel turn off
And I know her
He likes the car ', the motorcycle'
The Mota mixes' with the other
And Vece 'likes totos
[Chorus: Jhayco & Feid]
I don't look at her ', who is in hers
Ask for another bottle
That is what she wants (that e 'what she wants)
That is what she wants (that е 'what she wants)
I don't look at her ', who is in hers
Ask for another bottle
That is what she wants
I know what she wants (that's what he wants)

[Verse 1: Jhayco]
If you see it 'Na' (Wuh)
No, that she did not come to behave well (good)
Brought her friend and is going to kiss her
I later 'of the party goes pa'l after
Feeling 'in the freezer
It is not regular, that baby is diesel
This tube grabs me like a stripper
And I open that garage as if I had a Beeper (Can I follow me '?)
And what was it, what is going to do?
What happened? Tell me to see
I put my face in that 'tit' and it seems that it has 'tre' (it has 'tre')
Body, it is seen that you drink tea (drinks tea)
Of Medallo, I said: "See, well"

[Bridge: Jhayco]
Your body causes me
I want you to take away 'clothes
I want to eat you completely
The buttocks' are 'big'
Your body causes me
I want you to take away 'clothes
The competition is broken

[Verse 2: sech & jhayco]
They say that alcohol does not fix na ', you take
That the water either fixes na '
What do you want is jangueo
Until the ugly are bound '
And a long time ago
I have you bum-bum, in the sight, blam-blam
You tell me 'pa' where are you going
And I arrive, tell me which one the plan
That is not 'pa' to have a bad time (Yeah)
Give it, don't be shy, break
With what you invested, you killed the compe
Of Money Tag, so leave the border
Is in hers, so sopórnet
I have you bum-bum, in the sight, blam-blam
You tell me 'pa' where are you going
And I arrive, tell me which one the plan
That is not 'pa' to have a bad time, huh
[Verse 3: feid]
The abdomen has it hard, armor six
El Cora full of scar ', Scarface
I take it for the dark
BARTO BARTO THE SIZE OF A PURE
His ex was left behind Napster
Chavo 'explodes in Los Putero' Flow Gangster
Caro style, the fodder neck in diamond '
Do not upload a story if you farrea with singer ', ey
Break the street and see the sun rise
The big ass, for me who plays volleyball
It's a pitcher, janguea with turnsol
If you put pressure on her, she gets terror

[Chorus: Sech & Jhayco]
I don't look at her ', who is in hers
Ask for another bottle
That is what she wants
I know what she wants
I don't look at her ', who is in hers
Ask for another bottle
That is what she wants
That is what she wants2embed
