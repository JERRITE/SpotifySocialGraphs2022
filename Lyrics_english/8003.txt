Stitch You Up LyricsVerse 1
You watched all your luck run out
And you're feeling down
But don't let go now
You're a step away from faith
Give it one more day for your world to change

Pre Chorus
What if life was a wheel of fortune
Afraid of falling you'll never play
Losing touch with the very reason
You once believed that you'd find your way
Chorus
I'll be your hope when you don't see it
You're barely breathing I'll fill your lungs
When all that's left are broken pieces
Give me the seams and I'll stitch you up

I'll stitch you up
When all that's left are broken pieces
I'll stitch you up

Verse 2
Stay a little longer now
Let me ease your doubt
Turn the darkness down
Hey you know you're not alone
Though the road is long
I will guide you home

Pre Chorus
What if life was a wheel of fortune
Afraid of falling you'll never play
Losing touch with the very reason
You once believed that you'd find your way

Chorus
I'll be your hope when you don't see it
You're barely breathing I'll fill your lungs
When all that's left are broken pieces
Give me the seams and I'll stitch you up
You might also likeWhen you're barely breathing
Only no one's there (I'll stitch you up)
When all that's left are broken pieces
I'll stitch you up

When all that's left are broken pieces
I'll stitch you up

Chorus
I'll be your hope when you don't see it
You're barely breathing I'll fill your lungs
When all that's left are broken pieces
Give me the seams and I'll stitch you upEmbed
