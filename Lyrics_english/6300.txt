Starts Right Here Lyrics[Verse 1: Kenny Mason]
How you wan' play it?
How you gon' play it?
When you ain't seen nothin' this player
Me and my squad gon' turn them to squash
Like we don't see no other players
Ain't nothin' to squash, ain't nothing to solve
You play then you already dead
I'm ready to mob, I'm ready to mosh
Ain't moving with nobody scared
Keep pushing my buttons
I might push a button and have my boy push up and slay 'em
Made a decision to enter the lair
You better enter prepared
I seen it vividly, my vision of victory
I kill 'em and split the scene
Click with me and you'll never feel defeat
Learn how to heal from heat
[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Mason]
I showed up to show out (Until the show end)
Bet they wanna know how (I made it a no win)
It's gon' be a blow out (Once I get to blowin')
I do more than blow wind, (Show me my opponent)

[Chorus: Foreign Air & Kenny Mason]
It starts right here (Push up and step on enemies)
And it's a long road up ahead
Better get your steps in now
It starts right here (Ain't no regrets, it's him or me)
And if you wanna be a god it's a long way up
(If you wanna be a god it's a long way)

[Verse 2: Kenny Mason]
I'm too hype to turn down a fight, knock 'em out good night
I brought light, when it was no sight, now no foe in sight
I got stripes down to take a life, won't take it in stride
Ain't no might, ifs, or maybes, I displayed my might
(Yeah) I come to wreck up the game
It's fun but it ain't no game
I son 'em all in a minute I mauled 'em and bit 'em up like he was steak

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Mason]
I showed up to show out (Until the show end)
Bet they wanna know how (I made it a no win)
It's gon' be a blow out (Once I get to blowin')
I do more than blow wind, show me my opponent

It starts right here (Push up and step on enemies)
And it's a long road up ahead
Better get your steps in now
It starts right here (Ain't no regrets, it's him or me)
And if you wanna be a god it's a long way up
(If you wanna be a god it's a long way)

[Post-Chorus: Kenny Mason]
Push up and step on enemies
I came to conquer all the energy
Ain't no regrets it's him or me
Blast them away, away

[Verse 3: Kenny Mason]
Once we engage in combat, it ain't really no comeback from that
The squad the angelic slum rats
Came for the cash where the funds at
Came with the swag of a war pack
You see the sword, it's my award
I tried to warn you and your pack
So if I slaughter you it's your bad

[Chorus: Foreign Air & Kenny Mason]
It starts right here (Push up and step on enemies)
And it's a long road up ahead
Better get your steps in now
It starts right here (Ain't no regrets, it's him or me)
And if you wanna be a god it's a long way up
(If you wanna be a god it's a long way)Embed
