I Donâ€™t Know You Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep your apologies, they don't mean nothing to me
I'm done with pretending like I don't got somewhere to be, eh
You wanted the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy
I gave you my heart and you gave it back missing a piece

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're, ooh, so separated
And I'm losing all my patience
And you used to be someone I hated
Now all I know, all that I know is
I don't know you anymore
[Chorus]
I can't tell you where we went wrong
Maybe it's not anyone's fault
All I know is I don't know you anymore
Nothing even left to take back
Can't lose something you never had
All I know is I don't know you anymore

[Post-Chorus]
We've gone too far, we fell too hard
You broke my heart, you broke my heart
Forget your face, 'cause it's too late
To say you'll change
I don't know you anymore

[Verse 2]
You can't burn a bridge and then act like it's not a big deal (Big deal, yeah-yeah)
It's hard to find out the person you love wasn't real (Wasn't real)
Now you gas light me with thunder and lightning
And I don't know how I should feel
'Cause you still haunt me (You still haunt me)
Yeah, you still haunt me (You still haunt me)

[Pre-Chorus]
When we're, ooh, so separated
And I'm losing all my patience
And you used to be someone I hated (Used to be, someone I hated)
Now all I know, all that I know is
I don't know you anymore
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't tell you where we went wrong (Where we went wrong)
Maybe it's not anyone's fault
All I know is I don't know you anymore
Nothing even left to take back
Can't lose something you never had
All I know is I don't know you anymore

[Post-Chorus]
We've gone too far, we fell too hard (Too far)
You broke my heart, you broke my heart
Forget your face, 'cause it's too late
To say you'll change
I don't know you anymore

[Outro]
I don't know you anymore2Embed
