Wassup Phonies Lyrics[Intro: Louie Duffelbags]
I'm a different person since you saw me
I feel like a black sheep, you only know the old me
Fuck the phonies, chains for my brothers
Chains for my sisters, nothin' for the phonies (Yeah)

[Chorus: Louie Duffelbags]
Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?
Pretend like you know me, I'll pretend that we're homies (Psych)
I'm a real one, won't pretend like we're homies
Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?
[Verse 1: Louie Duffelbags]
Wassup, how'd I get this fucked up?
I was sober, it was over
It was darkness, in the abyss
Now it's like this

[Verse 2: BoofLord]
Niggas fake, fuckin' breathe funny
Keep it distant, got a pin on 'em
Hit me up like we good or somethin'
Fuck messages, what you need from me?
I tried, can't seal my lips
Can't sit next to me when you're bein' funny
Better make plans, my friend
'Cause a nigga be ducked, fuckin' gettin' money
We be ducked off makin' hits, homie
Full of shit, sounds are shit, homes
Big geeked, nigga, we gon' keep smokin'
Fuck fake friends, I got real homies

[Chorus: Louie Duffelbags]
(Yeah) Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?
Pretend like you know me, I'll pretend that we're homies (Psych)
I'm a real one, won't pretend like we're homies
Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?

[Chorus: BoofLord]
(Yeah) Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?
Pretend like you know me, I'll pretend that we're homies (Psych)
I'm a real one, won't pretend like we're homies
Wassup phonies? (Yeah) Wassup phonies?1Embed
