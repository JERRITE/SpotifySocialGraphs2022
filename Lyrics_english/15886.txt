That I loved you Lyrics [lyrics of "that loved you"]

[Verse 1]
The flame went out, I don't know
We kill the illusion, maybe
And where I remain in this world without color?
Without stories to tell you, not knowing how to explain you

[Chorus]
That I see you today and although I try it I do not forget
That you were you who did not believe in farewells
That I remain the same crazy that among your sheets was lost
And after all I am not different from that idiot
I loved you
[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter how it was, or who
We wanted to drink, without thirst
And where I remain in this world without your voice?
Ignoring the signs that lead me to find you

[Chorus]
That I see you today and although I try it I do not forget
That you were you who did not believe in farewells
That I remain the same crazy that among your sheets was lost
And after all I am not different from that idiot
I loved you

[Bridge]
Who still hopes to see you smile
Who still hopes to see yourself

[Chorus]
That I see you today and although I try it I do not forget
That you were you who did not believe in farewells
That I remain the same crazy that among your sheets was lost
And after all I am not different from that idiot
I loved you

[The end]
That I remain the same crazy that among your sheets was lost
And after all I am not different from that idiot
