As your Lyricsyo wife I give you all my life and even more I would like
You know well that I am so yours until one day I die

But see that when you fool me, you deceive yourself for your haughty, for those things you do with me I want to prevent God from being a punishment, I will leave so you have wanted it

Well look at how you risk you with the hope that I have put in you, with everything I believed in you
It's the best, go and fly free if you're going to do, the man who always wanted to see even if by your side I can't see me as your wife

It's the best, go and fly free if you're going to do, the man who always wanted to see even if by your side I can't see me as your wife
Like your woman
