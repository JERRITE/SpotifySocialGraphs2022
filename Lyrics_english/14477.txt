I like the asses of all flavors and colors
I want you to devote it tonight
Don't tell me not to eat 'ass, but I tell you goodbye (Bye)
He already removed his pants
He wants twerk as cardi b (twerk, twerk)
If I feel on top of it, you will leave it
You want to swallow me, like Hennessy (how rich)
The hotel in Miami is not to sleep

Make It Rain, Make It Rain, Make It Rain
With that ass is going to rain
Make It Rain, Make It Rain, Make It Rain
On that ass I rain
