My friend Lyrics [verse 1]
My friend, I know, you just live for him, who knows it too
But he doesn't see you like me, beg to my mouth
To say that he has confessed to me between glasses
What is it with your skin who dreams at night
And that crazy with each button
That unbuttoned thinking about his hands
He has not seen you tremble, waiting
A word, some gesture, a hug
He doesn't see you how me sighing
With open eyes for par
Listen to me to name him
Oh, my friend, I know and he too
[Saying]
My friend, I don't know what to say, or what to do to see you happy
I wish I could send in the soul
Or in freedom that is what he needs
Fill your pockets of wars won
Of dreams and renewed illusions
I want to give you a poetry
You think I'm giving the news

[Verse 2]
My friend, hopefully someday, listening to my song, suddenly you understand
What I never wanted was to tell your story
Because it could be moving
But, forgive, my friend
It is not intelligence, nor is it wisdom
This is my way of saying things
Not that it is my job, it is my language

[Chorus]
And my friend, princess of an infinite story
My friend, I just intend to count on me
My friend, to see if one of these days I finally learn
To speak without having to give so many rodeos
That all this story matters to me because you are my friend

[Verse 3]
My friend, I know, you just live for him, who knows it too
But he doesn't see you like me, beg to my mouth
To say that he has confessed to me between glasses
What is it with your skin who dreams at night

My friend, I don't know what to say, or what to do to see you happy
I wish I could send in the soul
Or in freedom that is what he needs
Fill your pockets of wars won
Of dreams and renewed illusions
I want to give you a poetry
You think I'm giving the news

[Chorus]
My friend, princess of an infinite story
My friend, I just intend to count on me
My friend, to see if one of these days I finally learn
To speak without having to give so many rodeos
That all this story matters to me because you are my friend

[Outro]
No no no
My friend, princess of an infinite story
My friend, I just intend to count on me
My friend, to see if one of these days I finally learn
To speak without having to give so many rodeos
That all this story matters to me because you are my friend2embed
