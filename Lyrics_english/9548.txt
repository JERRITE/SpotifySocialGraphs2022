Falling for You Lyrics[Intro]
"어느 회사 제품이죠?"

[Verse 1]
Holy cow, I think I've got one here
Now just what am I supposed to do?
I've got a number of irrational fears
That I'd like to share with you
First, there's rules about old goats like me
Hanging 'round with chicks like you
But I do like you and another one
You say "like" too much
[Chorus]
But I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you, oh

[Verse 2]
Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
Just as I was busting loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
'Cause I'm a burning candle, you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you, you're the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one

[Chorus]
I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Holy sweet goddamn
You left your cello in the basement
I admired the glowing stars
And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true
What could you possibly see in little ol' three chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready, let's do it, baby
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down

[Outro]
(Down)
With you (You)
Down (Down)
With you (You)
