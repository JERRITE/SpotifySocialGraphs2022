[Enter: Future & Tems]
I will wait for you, for you
Early in the morning, late at night (I'll wait for you)
Not even the time that is (I will wait for you)
The presidential roll is already on its way (tired, saying, "aye, yi, yi, yi")
Whenever I find time, it's fine (yes)
(Atl Jacob, Atl Jacob)

[Verse 1: future]
Pray for my demons, girl, I have you
Every time I take codeine, I become vulnerable
I know the sounds of the storm when it arrives
She understands that I can't take it to all particles, a black
I have been in the field as the children of corn
[Chorus: Future & Tems]
I can listen to your tears when they fall on the phone
Get angry about yourself because you can't leave me alone
Gossip, you're messy, that's not what we are doing
Trapped around the world (worried about an Xanny, would you boast, or would you try to get me?)
By phone, releasing tears (tell me now, I need you with pleasure)
I had to become more vulnerable than I just did (tell me now, I need you so much, yes)
When you are drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I am alone I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, wait for you, for you)
Don't say it because you know that's what I want to hear (I'll wait for you)
(I will wait for you)

[Verse 2: Drake & Tems]
Yes, I've been caught around the world
I sit on my balcony and ask myself how you feel
I have a career that takes away the time of women
I can't convince you that I love you to live (I'll wait for you, for you)
I will be in your line, feelings flow like a river
Send text messages again, you are with your kiki in the river (I will wait for you)
The messages say "delivered" (I will wait for you), but I know you don't understand
Why did you introduce us if you knew you were with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
He made me shake his hand when they were fucking for a minute (I'll wait for you, for you)
Say me from the table because you know I'm a swimmer (I'll wait for you)
It was supposed to be a dog, but you put me in a kennel
Girl, put a buzal to that, all that barking during dinner
I was fucking you when you had a little presidential
Improved when you met me and that is not coincidence
I tried to get the best out of you, but I guess I'm not so influential
I guess I'm not the one for you

[Outro: Future & Tems]
Early in the morning, late at night
The time that is does not even matter
Concerned about an Xanny, would you boast, or would I try to get me?
Tell me now, I need you with pleasure
Tell me nowmbed
