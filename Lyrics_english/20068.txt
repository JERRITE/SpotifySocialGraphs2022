Rampage Lyrics[Intro]
I heard y'all were looking for us, ha
Aye turn around lil'' nigga
Right behind you lil'' nigga turn around
Keep your eyes open lil' nigga
Gang

[Verse 1]
Runnin' thru my city with my guys in the back
In a big body coupe with a 30 on his lap
Pray everyday that I make it home safe
'cuz I gotta come thru and give my mom a hundred K
On the road daily, new cities everyday
Found a new bad bitch took her straight to the bank
Every day I close her data pickin' up a new wraith
I remember back when I saved my first ten K
Fuck niggas switch for the dumb lil' bitch
But I knew I couldn't trust her so I can't even trip
Got my stomach feeling sick with all this damn fake shit
All the calls that I get come with a favor quick
Never got a hand out, no, these bitches ain't shit
Everybody tryna claim that we all change quick
Go and have a 4v4, tryna kick a new door
Where was y'all at when we was down to the floor
Money changes niggas, you can see in they face
But all my niggas real, everybody got a place
Stay loyal to your grain
Never change for no fame 'cause its strictly only brothers
Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang!
Keep a tool on me when I'm riding in the coupe
Can't trust new niggas, they be plottin' on us too
Just spent 20 bands on my neck, that's a fact
All these diamonds in her face, she gon' have to throw it back
Bitch!
[Bridge]
[Like I said, Lil Bro In The Back With The Stick
I ain't worried 'bout none of that shit, huh
Just touched your weekly check in a night, Lil' Nigga, Get Yo Cheese Up]
Gang!

[Verse 2]
Looking at my past, like damn it was sad
Year go by, now my brother in a Jag
It's death before dishonor so I'll never change up
I stayed down with my niggas and we finally came up
Got a little fame then niggas started calling
Talkin' bout they love me, lil' nigga keep plotting
I keep one on me and I don't even gotta cock it
Said I keep one on me, and I don't even gotta cock it
