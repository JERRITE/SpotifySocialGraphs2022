He was wrong Lyricsél had two hearts
And it seemed that the two was falling in love
One gave everything like that without thinking
The other knew perfect, where, where and when, oh yeah

One was on his side
No matter what people were talking about
So transparent and in front, maybe too much
The other pretended and had everything calculated, oh yeah

One understood, the other demanded
That was that a rumor grew
He had to make a decision suddenly
He was wrong, he left with the other
Dowolating her alone with this love
He was made, he left with the bad
The one who did not love him, the one who cheated him

Oh, he knew he lost the most beautiful
Of the springs, the most full moons
Oh I know that one day he will cry
When I finally understand, when you understand it

He already lives with the other
While a life is collapsed
He will hurt his heart on rainy nights
In sunny afternoons, in each coffee with sugar

One loved him, the other entangled him
And that's how he fell
And he did not hesitate to be his
She lied to her

He was wrong, he left with the other
Leaving her alone with this love
He was wrong, he left with the bad
The one who did not love him, the one who cheated him

Oh, he knew he lost the most beautiful
Of the springs, the most full moons
Oh I know that one day he will cry
When I finally understand, when you understand it

I will go with anyone
Pay account
I will be like that

Pass the bottle now
That he lost the most beautiful of the springs
The most full moons
Oh if I knew, woe if I knew

He was wrong, he left with the bad
The one who did not love him, the one who cheated on him
