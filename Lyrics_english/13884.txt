​​a woman is a god (BIA Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Tommy Genesis]
Put it down now, let me see the cash
Spread your ass out, let me see the crash
Watch your world spin, I'ma smoke the stash
I'm a bad bitch, your bitch is bad
I'm a habit, you're a random girl
In the bathroom, snorting on the windowsill
You work in fashion, you got time to kill
It's a weekend but you feel weaker still
Watch 'em clappin', it's another show
Watch 'em glisten like their underwater gills are leaking
You in the mosh pit swirl and you geekin'
It's another world
[Chorus: Tommy Genesis & BIA]
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god
If a man is a man (Bia, Bia)
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god

[Verse 2: BIA]
Uh, being honest
I'm too bad a bitch to be modest (Yes)
I go bad about my deposits (Brrt)
You're way too average to be goddess (Cash)
I've been blеssed, well dressеd (Blessed, yes)
These boots are made to go cash, that check (That check)
These hoops are made to go down, my neck
I'm super save, so I down my stress (Uh)
If women and men are equal
Then how come you need us to breed you? (How?)
How come you need us to feed you? (How?)
Fear no one, they bleed, I bleed too (Yes)
Bigger pockets ego (Uh)
That's what makes these people go evil (Uh)
I put faith in God, no more people (Uh)
'Cause I want men no around, I don't need you

A woman is a god, yes
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
If a man is a man
Then a woman
A woman is a god (Yuh)
A woman is a god
