Autopsy 5 lyrics [intro]
This is a new exclusive One Shot
*Biatch ... it's life!*
Yeah, what's nine Fouiny Babe?

[Verse 1]
"If I get a tête-à-tête, I'm shooting it"
Negro you refuse head-to-heads and you piss on it
Hicham and Toumani are witnesses: this negro is weak
This negro trembles, Frérot, this Bégaye negro
But let's see, little bear: stop making the head
This is the first extract from your next mixtape
I saw you in the future with an alcatel tel '
Frérot is not hallal, there's just your panties that caramel
My criminal record on the net resonates
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Lambo 'in leasing, rental apartment
In Bois d'Arcy tone reufré funny reputation journey
You have sucked all new-three, given your ass in the new two
Taste my sept-eight dick, I give Milan in Ligue 2
You pay first -class tickets to the Michetonneuses de Paris
Arrived in Miami, they stop upstairs of Fouiny *is life *
B2obiatch, Izi: Michetonon stop, your mouth smells the zizi
You have a few fans who don't know who you are yet
You're not in the future: your album is imperfect
Do, do your feats with Rick Ross: well let's see!
A victim in featuring with an ex-date
Criminal record as big as it is a protein pot
Next time: get out of your cashier when you agree at the foot of the building
I approach the autopsy, but your balls are on a diet
True know why birthdays are canceled in the Régine
Negro you have tattoos, we have scars
Man we know who you are: b2oba ... trice
[Chorus]
My criminal record on the net resonates
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
"If I get a head to head, I shoot it"
Negro, you refuse head-to-heads and you piss on it

[Verse 2]
I loved my mother and I would have done everything for her
They kidnapped yours but you didn't fall for her
You called the chickens, the tralalas, the imprints
Do like Fouiny Baby: I have never filed a complaint
We live in the same block, negro: "See You Son!"
I'm afraid of Elie Yaffa as I'm afraid of Elie Sémoun
"Bakel City Gang", but you are never in Dakar
Don't worry, you will have your Green Card, stop dodging the fights
You like "Fouiny Story", Negro: it's life!
After rap, I see you as a dancer at the K.O.D
B2obiatch, Bitch A.K.A. Élie
I see that you are talking about Thiéboudiene #neufdeuxriz
"They treated my mother, I will never forgive it, Izi Izi IIIIZIIII"
Stop your bullshit, little zoulette r'n'b
#Vocoder: Where was the Renoi who reports with Ali?

My criminal record on the net resonates
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
"If I get a head to head, I shoot it"
Negro, you refuse head-to-heads and you piss on it

[Verse 3]
"Izi, what am I doing with all this sorrel?
Bakel City Groseille ... Bah Bravo Morray! "
You took it on credit, you have it in your parking lot
P'tites are 16 years old in your clip: Renoi Beleck in the casting
Go down a drink, stop your dirty tasks
I don't go to the whores, I can't dethrone the Duke of the Bois d'Boulogne
I'm dsk, you are a cleaning lady, rapping at Sofitel
It's no more rooster legs, haa sahbi, it's grasshopper legs
You live in a building, it will always be better to jump
You are well scaled, you look like Gérard "girls next door"
Credible on the net, virtual gangster
I made a feat with Booba, it proves that I have nothing against homosexuals
I come from far, I knew Hass, the bailiffs, the zermi
You were born a gold spoon in the mouth, my little Élie
Stop rapping our lives, Negro has no experiences
Our Beef has climbed the cachet of your security agents
You have been waiting to move to get your sheu-class out
I came, I defeated you, you hit the Harba
There can only be one, for that what has been moved
We all know your religion: Stop denying it
[Chorus]
My criminal record on the net resonates
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
Apart from B2O, I raped anyone
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
I am the owner, Fouiny is the owner
"If I get a head to head, I shoot it"
Negro, you refuse head-to-heads and you piss on it

[Outro]
What is B2obéatrice? She has her rules or what? She is there, she can do nothing more in rap, so she wants to be done with the buzz, she invents rumors on Fouiny: "It's a pointer, it's a pointer, it's a pointer ..." Hey, in your cannuer can, the girl she is saying that in 1997, I attacked a minor. In 1997 I was fifteen. Uh ... Aggression on minor, myself I'm a minor ... it doesn't make sense! You surely refer to it when I pointed out, B2obiatch! Or she surely alluded, I don't know, in college, I had to put a little hand in the ass at a girl, quickly ... Oops, sorry! Good in short, Madam Judge, Morray, I swear to you: apart from B2obiatch, I did not violate anyone. I admit, it's big stuff of buffoons, the settling of accounts on the Internet. I clashe, I make a video ... The real guys, they do not regulate their stories on the net, I admit. But ladies and gentlemen I can't do otherwise: when I come across my building, I say my car, I go to his window of his car, I say to him: "Go down, come , we will settle our things. "
He said to me: "No, there's the keufs, there's security ..."
I say to him: "Go down your race!"
I insulted him with all the names, any tier-quar guy would have come down from his car. Hassoul, when I tried to open his door to get into his car: click, click, click, closure, centralization of the doors. The guy is really a buffoon. Even my guy Toumani said to him: "Come, I am moving in your car, we're going to a deserted corner, we're going to run a tête", the guy refused! He refused two heads in one afternoon, my brother! Two heads-to-heads!
"If I get a tête-à-tête, I shoot it" but start by doing them, already, your heads, little buffoon! Afterwards, the guy he fled in his car. And later he will tell friends that we have in common in Miami: "Yeah I didn't want to get off my car; he's not from my team ...
Uh, I'm not going to get off my car otherwise I would have nicked it, I would have broken his mouth he would have filed a complaint and his two friends after I would not have had Green Card ... "
Kind of buffoon is! You know what, I learn to be clandestine with my honor that a buffoon like you holder of the Green Card!
Go ahead, go live in Florida, T'Efaçon you have the swag in Flo Rida
That's it!
