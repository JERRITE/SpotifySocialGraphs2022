Drill & Bass Lyrics[Intro: Blair Muir  & Double Lz]
I've been livin' on a good life, livin' like you won't stop
Givin' you the best of me, but
Now I'm feeling like it's all gone, baby, where'd it go wrong?
I thought we were meant to be now (I-I-I-I told you it's Blair Muir)
I've been livin' on a good life, livin' like you won't stop (Yo) Givin' you the best of me, but (Ayy, ayy)
Now I'm feeling like it's all gone, baby, where'd it go wrong?  (It's the beginning)
I thought we were meant to be now (Yo)

[Verse 1: Double Lz]
My fans tellin' me that I'm too cold
Tell her friend to tell her friend, there's a nеw flow
Tell her don't get makе-up on my new coat
Yo, bring her two friends 'round, it's a divorce
Tell her man "Speed up," 'cause they're too slow
Only Bruce know somethin' that you won't
Back then coulda snatched me a who blow (Yo)
Maybe I did darg, you know (Yo, yo)
[Bridge: Double Lz]

Brought me the blick, rise up and— (Woah)

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
Any country we land in, the dargs deya
Might catch us a flight over Marbella
Plus your gyal wan' tek it from a hard player
Watch this tune get beat from the car player
You ain't like that, so don't try that
I wouldn't pipe that, but she like chat
Free Boogie B, that's my right hand
I never look back from I made me a five grand (Ayy, hey)
My bro got a hose, tryna fire man (Woah)
You said you got yours, you're a liar, fam (Hey)
Better roll with your pole if you try a man (Woah)
He was loud, got caught, turned quiet, damn (Hey)
Where I'm from you shoot first, you could get shot (Woah)
Only type of shit they ever did was on the Xbox (Hey)
You could take your best shot, your bredrin sayin', "Let's not" (Woah)
She gives me the best slops, until she's headless
