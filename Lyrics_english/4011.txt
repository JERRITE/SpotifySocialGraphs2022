A thousand things Lyricsey! Underestimated (I know)
Starting tongue and rennet
The Tagus is not healing 3 years and
Two emcees out there
They chew so much that they should divide the publishing with me

You take it to Vacylon, but it's more than clear
True as Father Amaro
The pirea is a little without losing Saoco
They already know me and give me crazy
This goes for the B-Boys, for the graffiti artists
For my confined, my bandits
My misunderstood as maelo, rebel with cause the pioneers

It is that nobody understands them; The outside
In their own world nothing offends them
I identify because I am the same
You just have to look without comment

Chorus
Knows how to do a thousand good things with the life of others (bis)
But with his own he has not yet made Na
(BIS)

People boast of what lacks
They themselves do not have what they offer you
Others hate you but praise you
And maybe one day they charge

I am good but from afar
I live to the modern with twenty old
Boricua I was born, I grew up, a little and suffered
You think the same as me, I don't trust

Sabandija leave any Maya
And in all the jewelry stores
They sell Baratija
They say it's lizard, but it's lizard
Malianton, Silaganon like the botija
You might also like flag, I also have the right
The heir, from this dump
In clandestiness as a machetero

This is dedicated to social, prosecutors
That they are believed to be known, but

Rehabilitation, where?
With devils in uniform
No certificate there is no man chance
For being honored
I owe 15 to the lawyer
And you offer me a part-time at Burger King of County?

As Tito would say "but you are crazy? I look for one and a half for the coso"
It is an example, so that the Gobe falls in time
That with a hard hand are wasting time

Give alternative, see result
The stick was born fold and straightened it
Who are the good ones? Who are the bad?
It depends on the crystal with which we look

CHORUS

Hey
I arrive I hee the veteran leave it in his hand, so that they respect, I know, I gave you a chance to eat and want Black Saoco, Black Saocoambed
