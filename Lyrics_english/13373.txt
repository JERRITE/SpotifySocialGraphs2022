Meddle About Lyrics[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Well, come and get it now
Come and get it now
Baby, show me what you're doing
Come and turn around
'Cause it's not just a figure of speech
You got me down on my knees
It's getting harder to breathe out

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
We only met each other just the other day
But you already got me feeling some type of way
Now, if I could figure it out
I'd take you back to my house
So we could meddle about
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about
No-woah-oh-oh-oh-ooh
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about
[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]
Girl, just scream it out
Tell me what you're thinking
Oh, I wanna see you undress now
I wanna hear you confess now
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
We only met each other just the other day
But you already got me feeling some type of way
Now, if I could figure it out
I'd take you back to my house
So we could meddle about
