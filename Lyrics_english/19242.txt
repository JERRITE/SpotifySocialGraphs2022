[Intro]
(Furkan Nigga in Beat)

[Chorus]
3, 2, 1 ... Finish!
This rap is good and finishing
We are popular, like, like
You couldn't see that Biggie, Biggie
It would be a lie, your accumulation
One or two thousand
I said: "Hip-hop is a good idea."
Good comes, one or two miles
3, 2, 1 ... Finish!
This rap is good and finishing
Like we are popular
You couldn't see that Biggie, Biggie
It would be a lie, your accumulation
One or two thousand
I said: "Hip-hop is a good idea."
Good comes, one or two miles

[Verse 1]
Mine is over, you read (you)
Don't hesitate baby come sit down (come)
Thoroughly Tavra Bel (waist)
Give it to this (give)
We run forward (gelledur)
Capture Train Perone (Peron)
My man recognized my name
My man hıdı hıdı hıdı Fero this (Yes)
Bro hello to you this music rude
He says to you: "Your capacity!" Say: "Shut up Madafaka!" (hush hush)
Our house is sapa sapa, our rap flows flow
Fifa, Pes, Africa
Shakira, Waka Waka (Waka)
Look at the darkening grape grape (look)
I Fero Grows Day Day (Day)
No feeling to anyone blindly (no)
Respect, Grete to Death (Go)
Come to death, go to death (Woah)
Always the obstacle in front (height)
Look at your business, you are the one to trust the essence (essence)
Without listening to his word (word)
