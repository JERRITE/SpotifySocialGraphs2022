TranslationsNederlandsojos Lyrics [Lyrics for "Brown Eyes"]

[Verse 1: lasso]
It is the first time I invite someone since you left
And I'm fine
The same restaurant, but my jokes do laugh
I'm fine

[Pre-Caro: Sebastián Yatra]
She does get along with my friends
We never argue, it's what I've always wanted
But when I look into her eyes
I see that they are not your brown eyes
[Chorus: Lasso & Sebastián Yatra]
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes

[Verse 2: Sebastián Yatra]
The sun shines on the road
And in the rearview mirror, images of you
They say it is overcome
A love with another love, but

[Pre-Caro: Sebastián Yatra]
I can't see the color to the sea
I spend the sky, but it happens the same
She has the diamonds to look
But his blue eyes are not your brown eyes

[Chorus: Lasso, Lasso & Sebastián Yatra]
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes

[Post-Coro: Lasso & Sebastián Yatra]
(Any)
Without your brown eyes
(Any)
(Any)

We never argue, it's what I've always wanted
But when I look into her eyes
And I see that they are not your brown eyes

[Chorus: Lasso & Sebastián Yatra, Lasso, Sebastián Yatra]
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing
Without your brown eyes
Nothing is the same, nothing is the same, nothing (nothing)
Without your brown eyes1embed
