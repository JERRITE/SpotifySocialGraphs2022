[Intro: Karol G & Becky G]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Health, mommy
Ah, ah, ah, ay

[Pre-car: Becky G & Karol G]
What does not hinder
You got autogol by clumsy
This torque was great
I'm no longer for me, you fall in love, baby (chi)
Without visa or passport (no)
I sent your false vacation love (Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi, Chi)
Pa 'the shit and never come back
That everything is returned, no
What you did to me if you don't remember '
[Chorus: Karol G & Becky G]
Do not call me again, even the Cеlular
Of how toxic Erеs became harmful
Whatever it goes, it goes
With me do not make you wrong
How toxic you are, I don't want to see you anymore (Chi)

[Verse 1: Becky G]
I arrived Pa'l Party, take out the bottle
The one who loved you, I don't know who she is
I left you the review, I didn't even put a star
And I forgot you because you didn't leave footprint
I no longer look at pawrás, or pa 'parking
I have one who is ready to take me
The second is waiting at the hotel
And the third I know tonight (no, no)
Don't call me, my number changed (I changed)
If you want me to give it to you (give it)
Call 1-800-Jod
I don't know if you listened to me
Don't call me, my number changed (I changed)
If you want me to give it to you (give it)
Call 1-800-Jódete (Jódete)

[Chorus: Becky G & Karol G]
Don't call me again, even boté the cell phone
How toxic you are, became harmful
What leaves, leaves, ah-ah
With me do not make you wrong
How toxic you are, I don't want to see you anymore (ey)

Oh, I'm sorry (ah)
You 'win' to return (ey) died in the attempt (ah)
You made it see how you was missing time
You look good because mine or I count it (Papi)
I see you in the 'Rede', I can't believe it, what a penalty of you (you penalty)
I was good and what gonorrhea paying me like this (nea, what gonorrhea)
Two -legged rat, Paquita said it
A creeping animal (haha)
That everything that is going through is eaten
Devil, you ere 'a leather (leather)
Don't say "I love you," I better know sincere (ey)
Don't say "I love you" (ah) because that was in vain (ah)
Crying was' you and how I didn't get out
You walk to another, but you are thinking of me (Chi)

[Chorus: Becky G & Karol G, Becky G]
Don't call me again, even boté the cell phone
How toxic you are, became harmful
What leaves, leaves, ah-ah
With me do not make you wrong
How toxic you are, I don't want to see you anymore

And not even for something richer "
