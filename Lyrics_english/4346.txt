You deny me Lyrics [lyrics by "You deny me"]

[Verse 1: Baby Rasta]
They already told me that you spoke 'about me
How much look for me?
That even has the floor, and I don't know why
And the shit that you talk about me, you will have to eat, huh, eh
That I stay calm, so go with him

[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When I do it 'in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When I do it 'in my way
He tells me not to take it out, let him leave it (leave)
[Verse 2: gringo]
But you know 'the truth that makes you' happy
Speak what you want you to appear badly
You so much what gives you ', but the reality
At night I am the one who warms you
I am the one who makes you the truquitos that you like
Your friends look at me and quickly ask (hahahahaha)
Did you see how she deviated for me?
You played it, you wrapped yourself and lost
I don't know you well-Well, your friend told me
That a man like me is not needed to your life
That did not give you what I gave you
And as time passes, you can't live without me

[Choir: Baby Rasta]
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When I do it 'in my way
He tells me not to take it out, that he leaves it there
I do not know why you deny me
If I know that you prefer me
When I do it 'in my way
He tells me not to take it out, let him leave it (leave)

[Verse 3: gringo]
I have news for you
The photos you sent to put it on profile
For what the world finds out
That last night you were with me (aha)
I getting punishment
Tonight I'm coming back and I'm still
Pa 'that feels the OH-OH-OH
That picket 'e bicha, how, I get it down
When the woh-oh-oh feels
From twelve to the sei like the ass and pars
