Only you lyrics [lyrics for "only you"]

[Part 1]
Baby, baby, yeah
You were my baby, baby, yeah
Do you hear me? Tell me, do you feel it?
Why do I call you baby, baby, yeah
Each line of mine is only worth one word
Every word is too much because I get closer to you
Keep a distance, otherwise it will be difficult
Say a word, I no longer write
See what you do, understand what you do
How much time should still pass?
I Don't Trust Thesis Niggas
I don't, i don'trust thesis niggas
I don'trust thesis niggas
I don't, i don't trust thesis niggas
You're the only one
Baby, Baby, Yeah (You're The Only One)
[Pre-Hook]
Yes I know
I'm not always easy
But if you want me
I need that you show it

[Hook]
Uh, tell me what should I do?
Keep me, but I don't know what to do
Don't feel anything, but only you in the head
Only you, only you, only you
Tell me what should I do?
Keep me, but I don't know what to do
Don't feel anything, but only you in the head
Only you

[Part 2]
Is it because of me
That we are not yet ready?
It is not our time
Or tell me, is it up to you?
That we don't trust
We don't believe in ourselves
Because I have flashbacks from us every day
The silence between us is so hard
Want. But rather let it stay
Tell me how do we want to stay?
I'll take the first step
Do you take a step back
But I'll pull myself back
Go so crazy, baby
You might so like [pre-hook]
Yes I know
I'm not always easy
But if you want me
I need that you show it

[Hook]
Uh, tell me what should I do?
Keep me, but I don't know what to do
Don't feel anything, but only you in the head
Only you, only you, only you
Tell me what should I do?
Keep me, but I don't know what to do
Don't feel anything, but only you in the head
Only duembed
