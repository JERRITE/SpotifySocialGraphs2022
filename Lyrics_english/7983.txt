Listen Up! Lyrics[Intro]
OFB way
Gun way, gang way
Get right or get left
Ghosty

[Verse 1: Bandokay]
Every now and then I cut tru' your block (Where they at?)
But still I can't find me a soul (Ay)
We didn't-we didn't see Turna in Eddy
We caught him in Walthamstow (With his bae)
This bruck back here come old
We ain't leaving 'till he's shaking, no joke (Pumpy)
SJ splash man down, oh woah
Yo, that's two man in one go (Listen up)
Bandokay, I'm boss on my block
I make bad B's pop O's (I'm a Farm t'ug)
Anytime I meet new cats, I give them pics
They don't have to pose (They know)
Free Kash, that's bro, 'bout a year ago
He got locked for smoke (That's bro)
At traffic lights tryna give him this poke
'Nuff times F done ripped up coats
Any little stunt that them man pull
We popped up quick like toast (Bow)
Bad B on the nizz, she's doing the most
She brucks her back and goes (See you later)
And she give me mad throat
And now she wan’ boast, got her telling my hoes (Why you doing that?)
I just wan' squeeze like Shay
So when you see me you better use them toes (Zone 2)
[Verse 2: SJ]
I told bro that we're going on the scariest ride
And I ain't talking 'bout no rides in Thorpe Park (No rides)
You say you done this and you say you done that
Guess what little man? You're a talker (Your chatting)
I get pushed up front with my broski
And they get pushed right back like Walker (Dickhead)
Juice man down on the back road with my Rambo
And rinse that with water (Rinse that)
Don't cross this border
As soon as you step into Broadwater Farm
You're getting dussed out in order (Where you going?)
And we camp with the corn by the bushes
So don't ever think that you can walk past (No you can't)
I follow the money, no stopping
So I guess you could call me a stalker (I'm a stalker)
Pull up, jump out and we're letting the tool blast (Bow Bow)
Man's knees deep in it
And there's no way that I'll ever back down (Never)
My nigga made so many bands in the crack house
And he's still gotta count up these pounds
Bucked armed Jakes on the high road
I told bro we gotta go back right now (Right now)
Four pedal bikes, four Rambos
And that's everytime that we ride 'round town
You might also like[Verse 3: Bandokay]
(Add a K, get blammed like fuck it, you know)
My bad B got too much chat
Babes, come bank this pack where your crotch is (If you're OJ)
If bro don't know what he's doing
Pass me the dots, let Bando bruck it (I'll bruck it)
Said she seen me on the stage with H
Secretly, she's wet like a bucket (Uh huh)
And them mans olders are neeks
Tion Wayne's a fucking muppet (Nerd)
MB's fast like Turna
We stopped chasing him like fuck it (Haha)
Can't lose with bae like T
Bando always gotta tuck it (You know)
Swing my shank with force
So this Rambo might get stuck in
And tonight we're going on the glide
Don't be the one to get bucked (Why?)
Buck into me and S
Rambos out, you're out of luck (Don't run)

[Verse 4: SJ]
Money on my mind and my hearts in fully (Fully)
I'm a 22 bully, straight leather gloves
I don't rock with woolys (No way)
Pulling up, wagwan, what's goody?
Tryna insert my blade in hoodys (Ching)
She suck this dick, I ain't touching pussy
Get chinged while them boy try boogy
Them boy there cowboys like Woody
I been out in the field for ages
You can't test my patience
You can never ask me what my name is
Man been doing fuckeries on the pavement (Trust me)
Now I guess I'm everyone's paigon
Now I gotta clear out these wagons (Clear dat)
Spilt fruit punch all over my trainers
Slap this corn, wake up all the neighbours
[Verse 5: Bandokay]
Running man down 'till I run out of breath
I hate hearing, “you're under arrest” (I hate it)
You don't wanna see me and S
Rambos out, tryna hit that chest (PYC)
Big bumper, thick thighs and breast
Wan' flex with the gang and pop them F's (Aye)
Me and Zillz nearly crashed into feds
Skid, skrr, tell bro turn left
Creeps stab one, look 'round, who's next?
In the ride told my young boy flex
If opps pull up, they're fucking stressed
Buck me with Lz, better have your vest (Ching)

[Verse 6: SJ]
Don't get chinged out your DSquared jeans
Insert my blade in your Fendi tee (Insert)
You can't question me
If it's on then it's on, no need for speech (No speech)
I don't squash no beef cah my hearts fully on
And my heads on heat (Yeah, it's hot)
My broskis really are doing these drills
And he's the young definition of teached
Me and bro having talks about going on glides
In the same week we was going on rides (Riding)
Took a trip to the 9, we can't leave so quick so we circled twice
There's no opps in sight, it gets me mad when I waste my time
The opp thots want a Farm block tug'
Better suck dick, you ain't holding pipe (Suck it)

[Outro]
