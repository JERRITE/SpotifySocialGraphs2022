Moth to the Flame Lyrics[Chorus]
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a, a
He's that kind of man, mama

[Verse 1]
I should know better than to take your love letters to heart
When the game's already lost before it starts
But hope hides inside the clich√©
Like a nod of understanding
From the poet who first felt this way
How can I turn away?
[Chorus]
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a, a
He's that kind of man, mama

[Verse 2]
But every little pull at the end of the golden rope
Fills my foolish heart with foolish hope
That maybe you might feel the same
As if feeling the same was the name of the game
The name of the game
I shouldn't be playing

[Chorus]
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame
I can't help it, I'm a, a
He's that kind of man, mama

[Bridge]
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
I shouldn't be playing
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get

I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame (Ooh, a moth to the flame)
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame (To the flame)
I can't help it, I'm a moth to the flame (Ooh, a moth to the flame)
I can't help it, I'm a, a (A moth)

[Outro]
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
Close enough, close enough
Close enough to you, I can't get
He's that kind of man, mama5Embed
