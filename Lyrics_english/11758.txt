Wasteman Lyricssongtekst from Frenna - "Wasteman" ft. Jandro & Priceless

[Intro: Frenna]
Yah yah yah yah
Yah yah yah yah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Tell 'em It's a ...

[Fresh 1: Frenna]
We are so fast, see me now with wibi
That I make it is a miracle just like Stevie
I'm Gang Gang, Come And See Me
Enough MBs, don't ask for your Wi-Fi
I say my boys: "We once fill arenas", but without our feet
We didn't go to school, but we'll go in the books
You want to spit in my name, because that's what they want to call
See I am not afraid, I have ladies looking for me
I don't drive Nissan but she says I can do it djoeken
See I had fear of flying, until Su is where the books
I have to press that button and call those stewardesses
Pop Champagne on a plane in it yah
And I am with Young Bull, That's Kaene in This, Woosh, Dom
Singing Again and Again, Yah Yah, Yah Yah
[Fresh 2: Jandro, Frenna]
I hear you say you are the best
Yes, Say It With Your Chest
One wrong move and I activate immediately
I'm in the back, we're throwing signs
Peng tings when we are in the fucking tent
Ey Ah, I'm in Thalia
I want a chick that looks like Aaliyah
And I am never on that papi, yes
But your chickie tells me you have walou stamina, hey

[Hook: Frenna]
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman

[Fresh 3: priceless]
I have that status of my value around my neck
You don't want to know what I do with a stack
We eat well, but I am still hungry
I count my blessing, because you know I am injured
Yayayaya, I want to talk to you without a drama
Bring that shit back just like karma
We used to do so many things together
You should be ashamed

If I'm up, this is Balmain Papi
I am with Givenchy Daddy
And if you think you can bari
Then "Mi No Lob", Better Have Somebody Else
I used to swear I had more cards than kaki
Now I swipe my own pass in Abu-Dhabi
I play with paper, origami
Yayaya-ya

[Hook: Frenna]
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a washing man
I can't fock with a Wasteman, Wasteman
