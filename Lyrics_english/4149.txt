Give me a night lyrics register a night full of tenderness
And let my hands caress your skin
Without fear that ours is not an adventure
Like any slide I had in yesterday
Show me that one day was your sun your moon
Whom you need to walk
Your bread of every day like your fortune
How did you give me kissing me the same
I know that my wishes are like honey
Lover and natural how you can see it
Also in my body when they give me
Give me a night since you leave (bis)
Only you and me in the room
You hugging me and I hugging you
You will be for me and I for you
Although in the morning you move away from me
A single night very full of love
A single night of passion
A single night full of illusion
Just give me now since you go
Only you and me in the room
You hugging me and I hugging you
You will be for me and I for you
Although in the morning you move away from me
One night.........
I don't want to see your face full of sadness
Nor tears look that run for your skin
I just want a night full of tenderness
What do you love to love you forgetting yesterday
Even if you leave far I will keep loving you
There is nothing in this world that makes me change
Your kisses, your caresses I am longing for
Sighing deep because you are already (bis)
Only you and me in the room
You hugging me and I hugging you
You will be for me and I for you
Although in the morning you move away from me
A single night very full of love
Just give me now since you go
Only you and me in the room
You hugging me and I hugging you
You will be for me and I for you
Although in the morning you move away from me
Only you and me in the room
Your hugging might also likembed
