See Me When You See Me Lyrics[Verse 1: e-dubble]
Hey yo, 1996 was different
Lost B.I.G. and shit, we miss him
We need it back, we need the tracks
We need the rap to bridge the gap that exists
"Tipper" Gore said he cursed too much
Well, I still copped those CD's
FYI, FYE, ain't really got shit on me though
Yo, 'til I blow like C4
Never wanna be a star or a hero
Got a lot of soul, so I never fold
I field goals like I'm playing in the league though
Yo, see gold through the peephole
Pay bills, no more repo
We hit them J's in just the same way that you hit your free throws
[Verse 2: 27 Lights]
'96 was live, you can catch me in my whip
With a CD from the time when the music was the shit
I bet a hundred on myself, so a hundred's in my pocket
I'm going to the store and you know just what I'm copping

[Hook: e-dubble]
Been at it for a minute, and all my people know it
The years can take their toll, but shit, it makes for better poems
So I'm tryna paint these pictures
These pictures get me lifted
They take me to a place where I embrace my inhibitions
It goes: backseat windows up
Smoked out, boxed up
Two-tone, two cups
(See me when you see me)
I got one chance, one life
We roll no dice
We sold no hype
(See me when you see me)

[Post-Hook: e-dubble]
(I said) gimme a minute
So I can make a decision
I said, gimme a minute
So I can make a decision

Hey uh, hey yo, I never play the wrong songs
When I'm in the right mood
Catch me feeding that juke
While the boppers all choose
I got a hundred in my pocket, the music's never stopping
Even when they shut us down, we got plenty other options

[Hook: e-dubble]
Been at it for a minute, and all my people know it
The years can take their toll, but shit, it makes for better poems
So I'm tryna paint these pictures
These pictures get me lifted
They take me to a place where I embrace my inhibitions
It goes: backseat windows up
Smoked out, boxed up
Two-tone, two cups
(See me when you see me)
I got one chance, one life
We roll no dice
We sold no hype
(See me when you see me)

[Bridge: e-dubble]
I said, gimme a minute so I can make a decision
I said, gimme a minute so I can make a decision
I said, gimme a minute so I can make a decision
I've got a beat with a bounce, and some lyrics with vision
You can call this the hook, you can call this the chorus
I've got a feeling you're with me, so turn it up if you're for it
I said, gimme a minute so I can make a decision
[Hook: e-dubble]
Been at it for a minute, and all my people know it
The years can take their toll, but shit, it makes for better poems
So I'm tryna paint these pictures
These pictures get me lifted
They take me to a place where I embrace my inhibitions
It goes: backseat windows up
Smoked out, boxed up
Two-tone, two cups
(See me when you see me)
I got one chance, one life
We roll no dice
We sold no hype
(See me when you see me)3Embed
