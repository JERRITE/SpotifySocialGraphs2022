Flowers on a Grave Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another renegade
Stick around gettin' made
Gotta be plenty brave
To speak up

Blame it on the planets, man
Try to do what you can
Stay on the suicide
Everyone all the time
[Pre-Chorus]
The mind is a playground
And what goes up

[Chorus]
The sadness is the emptiness
We're shadows in the rain
She covered me in loneliness
Like flowers on a grave
Like flowers on a grave

[Verse 2]
Salt state of mind
It's like a Valentine
Rope around and make you mine
And I'm in a noose

The animals are on the move
Tell me what you're gonna do
I can see you comin' through
Everyone all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
The mind is a playground
And what goes up
You might also like[Chorus]
The sadness is the emptiness
We're shadows in the rain
She covered me in loneliness
Like flowers on a grave
Like flowers on a grave

[Post-Chorus]
(Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers)
Like flowers on a grave
(Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers)
Flowers

[Bridge]
I feel you in me
Although you're gone completely
I'm still alive
I am all night

[Chorus]
The sadness is the emptiness
We're shadows in the rain
She covered me in loneliness
Like flowers on a grave
Like flowers on a grave
[Post-Chorus]
(Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers)
Like flowers on a grave
(Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers)
Like flowers on a graveEmbed
