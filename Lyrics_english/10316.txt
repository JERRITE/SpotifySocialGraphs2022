Wanted a Name Lyrics[Verse 1: FRENSHIP]
Guess I was born this way, a young gun with something to say
Show me the door to take, I wanted a name
Tell me this is a way, I'll break any neck to play
I'll fake any smile and sign it away, I wanted a name

[Pre-Chorus: FRENSHIP]
And I feel like the moment and I pretend that I own it
And I know that I chose this, and I want it
This road isn't homely, I got ten thousand onlys
But it only takes one of them to hold me
[Chorus: Yoke Lore]
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
'Cause I still needed you
I needed you
'Cause I still need you

[Verse 2: FRENSHIP]
Tell me this is a way, and now that I learn it's a game
I'll take all the blame and keep all the shame to tell you it's fame
Now that I'm on my way, and nothing is ever the same
I've never been good with the change, I wanted a name

[Pre-Chorus: FRENSHIP]
And I feel like the moment and I pretend that I own it
And I know that I chose this, and I want it
This road isn't homely, I got ten thousand onlys
But it only takes one of them to hold me

[Chorus: Yoke Lore]
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
Could you love me like you used to?
'Cause I still needed you
I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
'Cause I still need youYou might also like1Embed
