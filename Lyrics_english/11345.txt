Carmelita Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear mariachi static on my radio
And the tubes they glow in the dark
And I'm there with her in Ensenada
And I'm here in Echo Park

[Chorus]
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinkin' down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town
[Verse 2]
Where I'm sittin' here playin' solitaire
With my pearl-handled deck
The county won't give me no more methadone
And they cut off your welfare check

[Chorus]
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinkin' down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I pawned my Smith Corona
And I went to meet my man
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street
By the Pioneer Chicken stand

[Chorus]
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinkin' down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinkin' down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of townYou might also like1Embed
