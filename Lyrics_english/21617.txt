Paul Newman Daytona Rolex Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never been accused of being fancy
I'm not stupid with my money, honey, I could be stupid for free
I took it to the antique roadshow
They told me it was worth a boatload
But I'm never gonna sell it, my grandaddy gave it to me

[Chorus]
Paul Newman Daytona Rolex
Perpetual motion you know this
Second hand smoother than Cool Hand
No tickin' for real
It makes me feel like time is on my side
Time is on my side
'Cause baby I'm a man from another time
[Verse 2]
If I could have one wish, I'd feed the hungry
If I had a second, most definitely it would be world peace
I'd bring back thе crystal rivers
And all of mother nature's crеatures
'Cause I wanna I wanna I wanna live in harmony

[Chorus]
Paul Newman Daytona Rolex
Perpetual motion you know this
Second hand smoother than Cool Hand
No tickin' for real
It makes me feel like time is on my side
Time is on my side
'Cause baby I'm a man from another time

[Chorus]
Paul Newman Daytona Rolex
Perpetual motion you know this
Second hand smoother than Cool Hand
No tickin' for real
It makes me feel like time is on my side
Time is on my side
'Cause baby I'm a man from another timeYou might also like1Embed
