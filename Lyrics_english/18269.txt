Distance (P-Valley Remix) Lyrics[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Yeah Yeah

[Chorus:  A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Jucee Froot]
Look, I might be no good for you girl
Trust me, love me from a distance, yeah yeah
I can see me and you in a penthouse right now, fucking when we kissing
I don't even trust myself, how can you trust me? Love me from a distance, yeah yeah
Two wrongs don't make a right, but it's only one night, boy you know you get it on site

[Verse 1: Jucee Froot]
My distant lover, know we gotta fuck with no rubber
We don't need no covers, know it get wetter than a puddle
I give you 50 feat, but tell me, do you need more?
Remеmber when we fuckеd Keisha with the deep throat
TLC, so baby get your creep on
She a freak, but baby we ain't equal
I don’t see nothing wrong with a bump and grind
I just wanna bust it when you on the Facetime
Lickin' on the screen, I know what it taste like
Turn you to a fiend I just want to take flight
I want all of you or none of you, all of you or none of you
When you coming through, I'm coming too
Boy I’m missin you, that's all I do
[Chorus:  A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I might be no good for you girl
Trust me, love me from a distance, yeah yeah
I can see me and you in a penthouse right now, fucking when we kissing
I don't even trust myself, how can you trust me? Love me from a distance, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Jucee Froot]
Wanna see the ass? Throw some cash
Got the type of body make you bust behind the glass
Quarantine pussy on ya face, no mask
Bring your black card to the Pynk for a pass
You can come see it HD, 3D
Nigga know that I’m a big freak, big tease
Till you throw it like a teepee, trick or treat
Made a nigga go skeet skeet
Make the seat go squeak squeak
Put it in cruise control
Show you what I’ll do if you was the pole
Climb it fast and ima drop on it slow
Tighter than a child lock on the door
Gotta a fat ass with some pretty titties
It look even better up in that Bentley
Pussy litty got yo windows looking tinted
No kizzy, I bring out the city
That ass be coming like Jiffy
Whip the Rari while he play with that pussy
Got his hand up in the jar like he takin the cookie
Got some real expensive nookie, he gon’ pay me in Gucci
Why your love so far away, got me feelin’ like Boosie
He be asking for the cutie with the big ‘ol booty
Named Jucee but I fucked the boy like my name Judy
You can see it, but don’t touch it got em dripping n drooling
100 falling scrub the ground like the floor got cooties

I might be no good for you girl
Trust me, love me from a distance, yeah yeah
I can see me and you in a penthouse right now, fucking when we kissing
I don't even trust myself, how can you trust me? Love me from a distance, yeah yeah
Love me from a distance, yeah yeahEmbed
