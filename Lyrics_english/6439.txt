Summerland Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everything is freedom
'Til the seasons change
And the trees start dying
And the sunlight leaves your face
Hear the crack of lightning
Where your heart will break
Into new beginnings beginning to erase

[Pre-Chorus]
But something 'bout May makes it all feel better, baby
Summerland holds what I want right now
It's like the hoodie you find and you wear forever, baby
Whatever ain't golden now will only come back around
[Chorus]
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland, oh
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland

[Verse 2]
Now the year is aging
And the shadows grow
And the color's fading
And the people start to slow
Like a crowded station
Where the air is cold
All the strangers waiting
On the train that could bring them home

[Pre-Chorus]
But something 'bout May makes it all feel better, baby
Summerland holds what I want right now
It's like the hoodie you find and you wear forever, baby
Whatever ain't golden now will only come back around
You might also like[Chorus]
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland, oh
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland

[Post-Chorus]
It's all golden
Every moment
Dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland
Flowing rivers
It's all romance
Dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Something 'bout May makes it all feel better, baby
Summerland holds what I want right now
It's like the hoodie you find and you wear forever, baby
Whatever ain't golden now will only come back around
[Chorus]
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland, oh
When summer comes, I'ma cut my hair
Take a long drive heading anywhere
Be dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland

[Post-Chorus]
It's all golden
Every moment
Dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland
Flowing rivers
It's all romance
Dancing all night with all my friends
Sittin' on the shores of Summerland, oh

[Outro]
We're golden (Dancing all night, oh)
In Summerland
I'm coming back to you
We're golden (Dancing all night, oh)
In Summerland
I'm coming back to you
We're golden (Dancing all night, oh)
In Summerland
I'm coming back to you4Embed
