Hot Fiesta Lyricsuuh, illegal
Move it, move it, move it, move it
In this party, hot women

So good at this party, women move
Hot at this party, hot women
So good at this party
Women move, hot

Brrr, oh, how that girl moves
How the waist moves, how it moves it
I crazy when it moves
Sabrosura, madness, what cool
I like how your waist moves
Datch, Stop Give Off, was saw
Give me more, more heat, more flavor

Uh, I lose control, with that hip movement
And who wins that geva, and who wins that geva
Hey no, I don't dare, he has candle
(Has Candela)
And if you get burn

Even if you don't want, you burn
Oh, how good is that geva
How do you get, but what, what, what, how do you get
But what, what, how, however, hey

In this party, hot women
So good at this party, women move, hot
But well, how good it is what
That what, you repeat it again

But what, that lack of respect is
That with my girl I dance and not you, hey, oh
I told you no, no

Don't mess with that
That there is a lot of girl at this party
Women, good women, good
What I want is to have it but that moves
(Move)
