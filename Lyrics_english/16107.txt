Lease On Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a sunrise on the longest night
Like a rescue coming just in time
Yeah, you save me when I cannot see the light
Like a heartbeat to a lonely drum
When I thought that, that the end had come
You remind me that it's only just begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Took my soul down to the water
Mama, I came back a different man
Long as we got one another singing (Oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on lifе
Everything's gonna be alright when I look into your еyes
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on life

[Verse 2]
Like a deep breathe, wanna take you in
When I hold you, I'm alive again
You're the proof that God's been listening
You're the side where the grass is green
Yeah, you shake me like a tambourine
No jersey's, but we make quite a team

[Pre-Chorus]
When you took my soul down to the water
Mama, I came back a different man
Long as we got one another singing (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on life
Everything's gonna be alright when I look into your eyes
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on life

[Chorus]
Lease on life, lease on life
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on life
Everything's gonna be alright when I look into your eyes
Got a brand new, got a brand new, got a brand new lease on life

Got a brand new lease on life
Took my soul down to the water
Mama, I came back a different man1Embed
