Stormtroopinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the early morning hours there's a din in the air;
Mayhem's on the loose
Stormtroopers comin', and you better be prepared
Got no time to choose

[Chorus]
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'

[Verse 2]
Comin' up that street, jackboots steppin' high
Got to make a stand
Looking in your windows and listen to your phone
Keep a gun in your hand
[Chorus]
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin' around

[Verse 3]
Two hundred down, and it's comin' 'round again
Got no second choice
Where's the justice and where's that law
Raise your healthy voice

[Outro-Chorus]
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'
We'll be ready. Stormtroopers comin'
Getting ready. Stormtroopers comin'
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'You might also likeEmbed
