Red Cream Soda Lyrics[Intro]
Spizzin' on these hoes
(Yeah, uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fuck on your momma, your sister
Puttin' the Percs in my system
Killin' them niggas like Hitler
Diamonds so cold, they from Denver
Fuck around cop me, chinchilla
My youngins, they'll fuck around, cripple ya
Gainin' my knowledge, I'm readin' my literature
Car different colors just like caterpillars
Damn, I love way that girls fitter
I slide in her DMs and then I just hit her
Fanta the lean, double cup favorite mixture
Brown skin bitch, man, she look like a snicker
Flow like I'm Pacquiao, diamonds, they rocky now
Niggas, they copy now, bitches, they fan me down
Didn't wanna fuck, now she say that she love me now
Never wear hand-me-downs, shoppin' in SoHo
JW Anderson, that's a no logo
Underwear, socks, and my tee, they say Polo
Need like ten racks when I'm booked for a show
Lobster, that pasta I order to go
When I eat cereal, Versace my bowl
Versace my fork, Versace my spoon
These niggas is jokesters, they really cartoons
Poppin' that molly, then go to the moon
Niggas be winches, they really not goons
Spend in the mornin', then get in the noon
The fifty round log and it sweep like a broom
I need my money and I need it soon
Drive the car fast and a young nigga crashed it
Smoke my own blunt, little nigga don't pass it
Sippin' the lean, man, I got a bad habit
Marino my clothes, VLONE on these fashion
[Outro]
I need my money and I need it soon
Poppin' a Perc' then I go to the moon
I need the money and I need it soon
Stickin' the lean and I go to the moon
I need the money and I need it soon
I need the hundreds and I need it soon
I need the fifties and I need it soon
Poppin' a Perc' then I go to the moon
I need my money and I need it soon
These niggas is swindlers, these niggas cartoonsYou might also like1Embed
