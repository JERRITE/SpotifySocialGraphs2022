Lyrics Moving ["Moucanzas"]

[Chorus]
Today I will change
Check my bags well
And get my feelings
And all resentments

Cleaning the closet, deleting grudges from yesteryear
And anguish that was in my mind
Not to suffer for such tiny things
Stop being a girl to be a woman
[Verse 1]
Today I will change, bring my courage to light
And give myself to what I believe and always be me without fear
Dance and sing by habit, and see clear instead of dark
Uproot my secrets

Stop living
But it is for living life
What shouts inside me
My freedom

[Bridge]
Today I am going to change, get out of me and not just a heart
Leave and stop failures, release the arms and freedom that oppresses my reason
Free flying with all my defects to rescue my rights
And do not charge roads and decisions to life
Today I want and I must change
Divide time and add to the wind
All the things I dreamed of conquering one day
Because I am a woman like anyone else
With doubts and solutions
With strengths and weaknesses
With love and heartbreak
Soft as a seagull but feline like a lioness
Quiet and peaceful but at the same time irreverent and revolutionary
Happy and unhappy, realistic and dreamy
Submissive by more independent condition by opinion
Because I am a woman
With all the inconsistencies that are born from me
Strong weak sex!

Today I will change
Check my bags well
And get my feelings
And all resentments

Cleaning the closet, deleting grudges from yesteryear
And anguish that was in my mind
Not to suffer for such tiny things
Stop being a girl to be a woman
