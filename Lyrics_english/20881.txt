Sneakinâ€™ Sally Through the Alley LyricsSneakin' Sally through the alley
Sneakin' Sally through the alley
Sneakin' Sally through the alley
Trying to keep her out of sight
Sneakin' sally through the alley
When up pops the wife

I said I can't find nothing wrong with being friends 'cause sometimes
She lets me use the car
She said if you can't find nothing wrong with your mind
You'd better, you better find something wrong with her, her
So I began to try to explain that it just wasn't, just wasn't just what she thought
I'd better find something to do with my time
The fact is I've just been caught
Sneakin' through the alley with Sally
(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Sneakin' through the alley with Sally
(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Trying to get away clean
Sneakin' through the alley with Sally
(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
When up pops the queen

Trying to talk doubletalk, get myself in trouble talk
Catching myself in lies, catch myself in lies
Mama just looked at me as if I was crazy
She didn't even bat an eye
So I began to try to explain that it just wasn't what she thought
I'd better find something to do with my time
The fact is I just been caught, just been caught
(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Sneakin', sneakin', sneakin'

(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Trying to talk doubletalk, get myself in trouble talk
Catching myself in lies, catch myself in lies
(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Mama just looked at me as if I was crazy
She didn't even bat an eye

(Sneakin' Sally through the alley)
Sneakin' through the alley with Sally
Sneakin' Sally through the alley
Sneakin' Sally through the alley
Sneakin' Sally through the alleyEmbed
