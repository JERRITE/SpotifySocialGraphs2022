Text You Back Lyrics[Chorus: brother sundance]
If I don’t text you back
You shouldn’t get that mad
Don’t take it personally
‘Cause I got demons on the mind
And I been running out of time, so
If I don’t text you back (Don't text you back)
How 'bout you don’t get mad
Or take it personally
‘Cause I got shit that’s going on
Inside my head
Now move along, so
[Verse 1: brother sundance]
For the first time this all makes sense
You only come around when the sun is up
Gotta drop a new single soon, if I wanna hear from you
Hate to break it to you, though
I don’t wanna hear from you, no
I don’t wanna hear from you, so
So, sorry to say it
I’m over the games
I’m over the maze and
I’m leaving you hanging

[Chorus: brother sundance]
If I don’t text you back
You shouldn’t get that mad
Don’t take it pеrsonally
‘Cause I got demons on the mind
And I been running out of timе, so
If I don’t text you back (Don't text you back)
How 'bout you don’t get mad
Or take it personally
‘Cause I got shit that’s going on
Inside my head
Now move along, so

[Verse 2: Bryce Vine]
Woah is me (Woah)
There’s nothing I could do or say
To make you understand what I’m going through (Nah)
The problem is me, no it isn’t you
Oh how cliché, okay I’m pushing you away (Yeah)
I can’t take no calls or texts today
Trying to hide the pain from yesterday (Yeah!)
So, I’ll be drunk or high beneath the waves (Yeah)
Aloe vera, the sun burning, it’s mad raw
Should be taking the wheel, but I’m in the sidecar
Swimming out while my demons tan in the sandbar
Stephen King, Carrie inside of me
Not a Bradshaw

If I don’t text you back
You shouldn’t get that mad
Don’t take it personally
‘Cause I got demons on the mind
And I been running out of time, so
If I don’t text you back (Don't text you back)
How 'bout you don’t get mad
Or take it personally
‘Cause I got shit that’s going on (Don't text you back)
Inside my head
Now move along, so (Yo)
If I don’t text you back
How 'bout you don’t get mad
Or take it personally
‘Cause I got shit that’s going on
Inside my head
Now move along, soEmbed
