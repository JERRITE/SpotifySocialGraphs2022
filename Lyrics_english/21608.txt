​blue sky mind LyricsHow you gonna get through this time?
Falling into a blue sky mind
Came to me in that song, my friend
I just wanna go back again

Mother standing right next to me
Showing me what i need to see
Rain is falling into my mouth
Flowers blooming all up and down

I found
In and through the body
It's in and through the body (All along)
(repeat to end)
In and through the body
It’s in and through the bodyYou might also likeEmbed
