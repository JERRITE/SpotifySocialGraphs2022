I am looking for lyrics [letter of "Ando looking" ft. Chyno Miranda]

[Enter: Chyno Miranda]
Yeah, Casanova
Chyno

[Saying: Agustín Casanova, Chyno Miranda]
I accept it, it's me who calls, writes to you and sometimes leaves you messages
Yes, it's me who dies for falling in love
I want to know if I have 'an appointment you and I stick' and dance
I want to know if you escape with me to a place where you have never been
[Choir: Agustín Casanova, Chyno Miranda]
I'm looking for a girl like you, that's how beautiful
This madman needs a baby like this, like you
I'm looking for a girl like you, that's how beautiful
This madman needs a baby like this, like you

[Verse 1: Chyno Miranda]
Let me know about you
I want to meet you more
Give it, come to me
Let's kill curiosity
Let's go together 'to Paris
Girl do not deny it anymore
Just give me a signal

[Pre-Caro: Agustín Casanova, Chyno Miranda]
And if you want love, we are going directly to New York
And if you want heat we go to Ibiza and get better
And if you want love, we are going directly to New York
And if you want heat we go to Ibiza and get better

[Choir: Agustín Casanova, Chyno Miranda]
I'm looking for a girl like you, that's how beautiful
This madman needs a baby like this, like you
I'm looking for a girl like you, that's how beautiful
This madman needs a baby like this, like you

[Pre-Caro: Agustín Casanova, Chyno Miranda]
