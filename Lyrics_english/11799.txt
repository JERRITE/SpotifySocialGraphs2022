Queen of Pikas Lyrics [Lyrics of "Queen of Pikas"]

[Intro]
Mmhhh
MHH

[Pre-car]
If you love me, don't take me away ’Everything
That when you leave, I live with the monkey (Ey-YEAH)
Run-corner that the bull catches you
And you are losing him talking to a fool (Ey-Yeah)
If you love me, don't take me away ’Everything
That when you leave, I live with the monkey (mmhhh)
You reign, you reign
I clean the staircase and throne

[Chorus]
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA-NA)
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA-NA)
I see you and it's like
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA-NA)
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA-NA)
I see you and it's like
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA)
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA)
I see you and it's like
UH-NA-NA (UH-NA-NA)
UH-NA-NA (NA-NA-NA)
Hey Hey hey

[Verse 1]
I don't know how many times he tries to tell me
Not to be tried, that love no longer exists
But I look at her
And all those from outside stay in a joke
I let you go ’with anyone
I let you go ’with whom you want
But there must be a way-to
Mommy, tell me, why don't you stay, ah?
