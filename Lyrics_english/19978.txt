Change Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now
To accept all responsibility

[Pre-Chorus]
I go out of my way to live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me
[Verse 2]
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing

[Pre-Chorus]
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Outro]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it nowYou might also like35Embed
