Wish We Were Strangers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I fell for your pretty lies
And you looked me in my foolish eyes
And swore we’d last forever
For the worse and for the better
Then you laughed out loud and my heart sank
'Cause for a second I believed every word you said
'Cause it felt like you meant it
And in my bones I felt it

[Chorus]
If only I could take it back
That one night you said my name
I never woulda laughed shoulda walked the other way
I wish I never let you kiss me in the pouring rain
I wish that we were strangers again
Never woulda stayed and you wouldn't leave me hanging
Wish that I could change every word that you were sayin'
Tears fall down my face and I'm screaming that I hate him, oh
I wish that we were strangers again
[Verse 2]
Do you think you were a good one?
Have some excuse for leading me on
Now I have to look away
Every time it rains
And I tried so hard to make sense of it
How someone like you's so good at faking it
And I wish you all the best
But I wish we never met

[Chorus]
If only I could take it back
That one night you said my name
I never woulda laughed shoulda walked the other way
I wish I never let you kiss me in the pouring rain
I wish that we were strangers again
Never woulda stayed and you wouldn't leave me hanging
Wish that I could change every word that you were sayin'
Tears fall down my face and I'm screaming that I hate him, oh
I wish that we were strangers again

[Bridge]
And you loved me more
And I wasn’t hurt
And I was what you wanted
It’s so sad that it could’ve worked
But you can’t change the past, oh
You can’t change the
You might also like[Chorus]
If only I could take it back
That one night you said my name
I never woulda laughed shoulda walked the other way
I wish I never let you kiss me in the pouring rain (Oh, oh)
I wish that we were strangers again
Never woulda stayed and you wouldn't leave me hanging
Wish that I could change every word that you were sayin'
Tears fall down my face and I'm screaming that I hate him, oh
I wish that we were strangers againEmbed
