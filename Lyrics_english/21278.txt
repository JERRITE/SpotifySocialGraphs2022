The River Is Rising Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another fool for rage
Another truth betrayed
Another lackey out of line
Torture and rip-apart
What was the pure of heart
Poison the well and push the lie

[Pre-Chorus]
All in the name of nothing
Have we been hypnotized?
No doubt the end is coming
We're out of time
[Chorus]
Hang on
The river is rising
Hold strong
The tide is high
Will we drown in paradise?

[Verse 2]
Another wicked scheme
Another static dream
Indoctrination for the blind

[Pre-Chorus]
All in the name of nothing
Have we been hypnotized?
No doubt the end is coming
We're out of time

[Chorus]
Hang on
The river is rising
Hold strong
The tide is high

[Bridge]
A promise gone
Seething raging from the heart
You might also like[Guitar Break]

[Chorus]
Hang on
The river is rising
Hold strong
The tide is high
A promise long gone
So don't deny it
A cold dawn is sure to rise
As we drown in paradiseEmbed
