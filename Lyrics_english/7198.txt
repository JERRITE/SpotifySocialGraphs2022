Need Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you getting tired of Versace and the loafers
You got every pair but need somebody that could hold you
'Cause you got a hole in your heart that the bags can't fill
Pain in your eyes that the cash can't heal
Wake up everyday waiting for it to be over

[Pre-Chorus]
You had a taste of love
But he fucked up and now you're numb
You said your over and done
Over and done with love
[Chorus]
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love

[Verse 2]
I need your lovin', I put no one up above ya
Been feeling like you a secret I keep you so undercover though
No one knows about you don't mean that I don't trust you
Girl you got my heart and can't nobody take it from you
Take you everywhere you want to go and not your money
Flippin' pages of the past, movin' forward different story, yah-yah
Different chapter, yeah
Switching up my faction, yeah
I'm infatuated, yeah
Got me so distracted, yeah-yeah
Girl I'm locked in, don't know why you asking now
Treat you like my music
I love you with a passion, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You had a taste of love
But he fucked up and now you're numb
You said your over and done
Over and done with love
You might also like[Chorus]
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love

[Outro]
I know that you can do it all by yourself
You probably really don't need my help
But we all need somebody to love
We all need somebody
We all need somebody3Embed
