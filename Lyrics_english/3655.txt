I Love You 3000 II Lyrics[Intro: Stephanie Poetri]
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my best friend
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be somethin'
Straight out of a Hollywood movie

[Verse 1: Stephanie Poetri]
See you standing there
And nothing compares
And all I can think
Is, "Where is the ring?"
'Cause I know you wanna ask
Scared the moment will pass
I can see it in your eyes
Just take me by surprise
[Pre-Chorus: Stephanie Poetri]
And all my friends, they tell me they see
You're planning to get on one knee
But I want it to be out of the blue
So make sure I have no clue
When you ask

[Chorus: Stephanie Poetri]
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my best friend
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be somethin'
Straight out of a Hollywood movie

[Verse 2: Jackson Wang]
I see you standing there
And I can't help but stare
I'm ready to bring
Your wedding ring
On the day that we met
I wanted to ask
If you'd be by my side forever

[Pre-Chorus: Jackson Wang]
And all your friends, they tell you they see
Me planning to get on one knee
I'll make sure it's out of the blue
I promise you'll have no clue
When I ask
You might also like[Chorus: Jackson Wang]
Baby, take my hand
I just wanna be your best friend
'Cause I'm your Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
