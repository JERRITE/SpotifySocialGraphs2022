Maya The Psychic Lyrics[Verse 1]
We’re not just dreamers
We’re the kind that comprehend
We gather up our forces
She’s busy hearing voices again
Pneumonic-screamers came to gather up our friends
If giving in is pointless then get out of bed
Or this might be the end

[Chorus]
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more
[Verse 2]
You teenage believers, rallied up against the fence
Use weapons of clairvoyance
You adolescent strike force against
Metallic deceivers
From a planet far away
But when you read my fortune, are we running home
Or running free today?

[Chorus]
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more

[Bridge]
Are you hearing voices again?
Are they with you, and are they giving you commands?
I know you’ve had choices to make
But I’m with you
You’re never facing them alone today
You might also like[Chorus]
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more
(Are you hearing voices?)
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
(Are you waiting for this?)
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more
(Are you hearing voices?)
Voices hearing you loud
We’re taking the sound back with us
(Are you waiting for this?)
Now I’m hearing you loud
We’re coming around
Just give us more15Embed
