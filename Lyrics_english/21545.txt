Wobble Lyrics[Intro: DJ Frank Ski]
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!

All the shawties in the club (Let me see you just)
Back it up, drop it down (Let me see you just)
Get low and scrub the ground (Let me see you just)
Push it up, push it up (Let me see you just)

[Verse 1: V.I.C.]
I got 'em shakin' they boobies like congos
Man I'm shakin' the city like quakes (Yeah)
The haters blue in the face, like Gonzo
Cause I'm baking a cake so let's bake (Yeah)
I'm taking the game, the game's mine (Mine)
Y'all witness the change, it's my time (Time)
Y'all new to the game but y'all might wanna
Save ya whack raps, daylight saving time (Time)
I can dance homey, I don't two-step
Y'all lookin' at somethin' like a true player
A girl told me that a man that could dance
Might could possibly get down with the tool in his pants
Now all my ladies let me see you vibrate
And when it's over you ain't gon' need ya vibrator (Yeah)
Cause I'm a pro, make you bend your back low
Then I pound it real fast just like the perculator

Girl wobble it (Yes) and I'mma gobble it
I seen you moving your head, your head bobbling (Hell yeah)
We can cradle the bed, I'm straight racking it
The girls say my head like the head of a rocket ship (Ha ha)
God damn I'm so explicit
But I can't help it my flow ridiculous
Boy got a gift like it gotta be Christmas
Swag don't miss like he gotta be gifted
The girls brought cameras and they want pictures
And they gon' frame 'em, to see that nigga
Led 'em to the bed while I'm sayin my scriptures
Cause I leave ya holy like you pray in the temple
Want beef? I move with the led of a pencil
And mine won't miss you, goodnight kiss you
Take it there and back, cause you got pistols
And I don't think Donnie Vick can run these issues
