Dive With Me Lyrics[Intro: Cathrine Lassen]
Come fly with me

[Verse 1: Cathrine Lassen]
We could run into the wild
Feel the grass beneath our feet
Let the moonlight be our guide
Just come along with me

[Pre-Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
We'll find a place by the riverside
Far from the noise and the city lights
[Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
So give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
And come dive with me by the waterfall
Give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
Come fly with me by the waterfall tonight

[Post-Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
Come fly with me
Come fly with me

[Verse 2: Cathrine Lassen]
Feel the raindrops on my skin
While you whisper in my ear, yeah
Now, my body's shivering
There's magic in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
We'll find a place by the riverside
Far from the noise and the city lights

[Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
So give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
And come dive with me by the waterfall
Give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
Come fly with me by the waterfall tonight

Run away to the water
Run away to the water
Run away to the water
The waterfall

[Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
Give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
And come dive with me by the waterfall
Give in, give in to love
Give in, give in to love
Come fly with me by the waterfall tonight

[Post-Chorus: Cathrine Lassen]
Come fly with me
Come fly with me by the waterfall tonight

[Outro: Cathrine Lassen]
Run away to the water
Run away to the water
Run away to the water
The waterfall1Embed
