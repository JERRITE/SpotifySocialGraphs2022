Whip Lyrics [letter of "whip"]

[Verse 1: randy]
This is for the fever, the car, it turns them on
The phillie opens it, he goes down, ignites
The bass rumbles, the agent offends
La Baby looks at you, riding it, serves it
Search ’La Hookah and we take us 'to Toa' Las Puta’
The route to the beach and for the beach there is no wig
Bottle, blone ', rola tussi pa' la muse
There is no time for excuse, here killing 'the tusa
[Chorus: Randy, Jowell]
But he always asks, what? A whip
Without hug
That puts him in the seat 'The car
Flexible, of a 'spatarro
And he asks me, what? A whip
Without hug
That puts him in the seat ’the car
Flexible, of a ’spatarro (aight?)

[Verse 2: randy]
I control it
Crazy note with grandmother's note
You with that mini weak '
He teaches me ’, how and you play it '
Pa'l Perreo, put pa 'La Joda, Pa’l Boofeo
If the pretty goes with the ugliest, hey
Pa'l perreo, put for the joda, not the Chanteo
If I already know that you are a lover 'El Bellaqueo
If the 'fine' are the 'most whore'
And the 'most whore' are the 'finest'
The married 'like the trick (Shorty)
And to the 'single' of Pinga in Pinga

[Bridge: Jowell, Randy]
Oh, give it, ride in the machina
I am going down, you jump up
With a dog in the tek, it goes down to the farm
When she cule e '? A murderer

But what
Wants me to hit and start dancing
Let me release
That I give you a drag '
He wants a whip, whip, I'm going to give you
For detriment, give it what? GIVE TRA
I am the one who puts the reggaeton very sadistic (me)
Follow 'in Vacilón and that does not panic
Here none cannot border us
Fifteen year ago 'Coronamo' La Vuelta (Pla)
Brinquen Teta ', Brinquen-Brinquen Teta'
You well beautiful in a cajeta, ey
Brinquen Teta ', but they are already
And the 'buttock' up subject ', ah

[Chorus: Randy, Jowell]
But he always asks, what? A whip (Jowell)
No hug, only singing (Randy crazy note)
That puts him in the seat 'The car (Viva el Perreo)
Flexible, the 'Espatarro (DJ URBA)
And he asks me, what? A whip (Rome)
Without hug, only singing (the Evo Jedis)
That puts him in the seat 'The car (with the most' loose ', daddy)
Flexible, of a 'spatarro (I have not believed it for a long time)
[Outro: Randy, Jowell]
I perreo the control
Take, take, take
This if e 'true'
You with that mini weak '
He teaches me ', how and you played you'1embed
