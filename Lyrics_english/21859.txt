Walk With You Lyrics[Verse 1: Della Reese & The Verity All-Stars]
When you walk down the road
Heavy burden, heavy load
I will rise and I will walk with you
(I will walk with you)

When you walk through the night
And you feel like you want to just give up, give up, give up on the fight
I will come and I will walk with you

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, walk with you)
Until the sun don't even shine
(Walk with you)
I'll be there all the time
I tell you I'll walk with you
(See you through)
[Verse 2: Della Reese & The Verity All-Stars]
When you walk from this place (From this place)
And you gotta go to meet Him, it's time to meet Him face to face
(Face to face)
Take my hand (Take my hand) and I will walk with you

[Chorus: Della Reese & The Verity All-Stars]
(Oh, oh, walk with you)
('Til the clouds fade away)
I tell you I 'll walk with you
(Each and every day)
Oh yes, I'll walk with you

[Bridge: Della Reese & The Verity All-Stars]
(Oh, oh, oh when nobody cares)
I'll be right there by your side
(When all your hope is lost)
I'm the one that's gonna help you see the light
(Just look into my eyes)
Please know you're not alone
(You're not alone)
I'm here (I'm here), I'm here (I'm here by your side)
By your side

[Outro: Della Reese & The Verity All-Stars]
(Walk with you) (Walk with you, oh yes)
(Walk with you) I'll be there all the time
(I'm gonna walk with you)
(Walk with you)
I'll be there 'til the clouds just fade away
('Til they fade away)
(Walk with you, I will walk with you)
I'll be there every day, every day, every day, every day
(Oh yeah)
(Walk with you)
I'll be with you all the while
(Every time, I will)
(Walk with you)
Be right there through the longest mile
(I'll never leave)
(Walk with you)
I will walk with you, yes I will, yes I will, yes I will, I will
(Walk with you, I will walk with you)
I tell you I'll be there
(Walk with you, I will walk with you)
And I will walk with you (Walk with you)
Oh yeah (Walk with)
Believe me, I, I, I'll be there and I'll walk with you, yes, I will
I will walk with you (Walk with)
