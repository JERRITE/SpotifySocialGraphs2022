Miracle Nights Lyrics [Chorus: CLIEN & KYLIX]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night we have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us)

[Verse 1: Goodboy]
Cupid once again, I look stupid again
But now it's not confusing, especially
You and I are here next to, tonight, yeah
Stare at our lips
And as if there was something to say
Talking our bodies
As if they wanted to be thieves
And stole the clock hand
Leave, avoid problems along the way (yeah, yeah)
'When your eyes are closed (' when your eyes are closed)
You are good at being nice (you are good at being nice)
But what do you think (but what do you think)
Up to this
[CHORUS: CLIEN & KYLIX]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night we have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us)

[Verse 2: Crakky]
I care, baby, 'don't worry
Let's imagine as if we were just two
'Don't look at what they think
We will be together too, right?
After all, no more jokes, you are the hero
Take every lowering of the negative
It causes you to interrupt my wrong
'I will not miss the moment, you are just here
Yong is really nice
'When the light is fulfilled, it is more likely to be
Hold on with my hands, 'I will not lower you
Let's ride onto the balcony, whatever does
Simple but very difficult to find
Luckily that when you are honest with the dream
Let's make the most of the inconvenience
If it was only one night it could happen, ohh
You might also like [Chorus: Clien & Kylix]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night we have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us)

[Verse 3: Russell]
Yuh!
Let us take the end of the
Moments in time borrowed
It is important for every integration to
There is no need for anyone else to know
I like the type that always has a job
Pure laughter and smile you just need
You are the only one I will choose to be with
Up to the back of the world sinful
'Don't be in a hurry, we just don't want to go wrong
Allow me to be with you
'No need to worry,' I don't say that, yeah
Yuh, I have nothing more to ask
If the night is not a night
We are just two, you look at
You are just here with me, I don't want to leave
[Verse 4: PESO Mercado]
Fast or slow, come, here
Babe, 'don't cry
I'm not going to be a hitch
I promise my behavior is beautiful
You just want to be with you, even a moment
No matter what to do, you are very strong
Hope you like it too morning until you get
Just me and you still (the awesome 'no)
Just to me you go with
No matter what you do
'I will never look for another
Your lips are just playing
I know, you will never appear
As we started, here's just, 'don't be shy
Slowly move, scream
Let's slow down the bitter
Allmo $ t music !!

[CHORUS: CLIEN & KYLIX]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night let's have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us)

[Verse 5: Kylix]
It seems like there are things that are holding you back
I can see even if I look at you in the distance
Giving the body to those who want to experience
'Don't think about it, it's just here in case
You wanna be with somebody (you wanna be with somebody)
Switch roads home
Deepen the night (deepen the night)

[Verse 6: Jom]
Oohh, did you know with a smile you
Was removable all I was tired of
You are the one who serves as my lean
When I'm struggling, so I'm not going to go
Because you are the only one
You are filled with color my world dark
I will never waste your love, 'I will not hide
Because you proved to me with love
So don't wonder why I hold it tight

[CHORUS: CLIEN & KYLIX]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night we have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us)

[CHORUS: CLIEN & KYLIX]
Just to me, come along
'I will never look for another
Every night we have fun
Unfortunately 'when you are gone
'Don't overlook the viewers
To the two of us (the two of us) 1embed
