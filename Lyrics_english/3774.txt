Change lyrics [words of "change"]

[Verse 1]
My friend, my future
My life, forgive me
This unexpressive face
Sadness
Many times I had to lie to you
Or put myself in the shoes of another
Kilometers between speech and act
You ended up seeing my little actor game
[Chorus]
But ... leave me, I can explain everything to you
Sometimes I have things that I do not understand
Night helps me meditate
It is in these moments that I say that I will change ... (change, change, change)
I'm going to change ... (change, change, change)

[Verse 2]
My troubles, my desires
My desires, my pleasures
Have taken over my family life
Until it diverted
Money destroys the hearts of others
I can not dissociate the enemy of the friend
Too bad I do not have their empire
I prefer your smile in a mouse hole

[Chorus]
But ... leave me, I can explain everything to you
Sometimes I have things that I do not understand
Night helps me meditate
It is in these moments that I say that I will change ... (change, change, change)
I'm going to change ... (change, change, change)

[Verse 3]
Sitting in the dark
Busy counting my faults
At the depths of the corridor
Hung on an atom of hope
Sitting in the dark
Busy counting my faults
At the depths of the corridor
Hung on an atom of hope
You might also like [refrain]
But ... leave me, I can explain everything to you
Sometimes I have things that I do not understand
Night helps me meditate
It is in these moments that I say that I will change ... (change, change, change)
I'm going to change ... (change, change, change) 19embed
