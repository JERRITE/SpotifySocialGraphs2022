Better no longer lyricsletra "better no longer" 

 Better stop than finish more bad 
 Better to say "It was good here" 

 Better to think "I will find you again" 
 I will be happy to see us smile ... 

 And if it didn't work, there is no blame, no 
 Maybe it's the best 
 You haven't been you or me 
 Only, no, this time it was not given 

 Better both, let's put the end 
 Thus it started, so you have to end 

 Inside you you know the same as me; 
 I could continue but no longer ... 

 Better both put the end 
 Thus it started, so you have to end 

 Inside you you know the same as me; 
 I could continue but no longer 

 And if it didn't work, there is no blame, no 
 Maybe it's the best 

 And if it didn't work there is no blame, no 
 Maybe it's the best 

 You haven't been you or me 
 Only, no, this time it was not given 

 Better no longer ... 
 You might also like if it didn't work there is no blame, no 
 Maybe it's the best 

 You haven't been you or me 
 Only, no, this time it was not given 

 And if it didn't work, there is no blame, no 
 Maybe it's the best ... embed
