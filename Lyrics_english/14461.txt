She Don’t Give A Fo Lyrics [Letter from "She Don't Give A Fo" ft. KHEA]

[Intro: Duki, Iacho, Khea]
EY (Duki)
Yeah (Khea Young Flex)
Ah-wow
She Don't Give A Fo, Oh
She Don't Give A Fo, Oh-Oh

[Pre-stribe: Duki, Khea]
He knows that I love her, but She Don't Give A Fo (Na-Na-Na, EH)
Maybe it's fear, but She Don't Give A Fo
He wants someone with a future, without so many humor (Na-Na-Na)
Or that's what I think (huh), but she don't give a fo
[Chorus: duki, khea]
She Don't Give A Fo, Baby, She Don't Give A Fo
She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH), Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH)
She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH), Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH)
She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH), Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (OH-OH)

[Verse 1: duki]
I am a crazy yonqui for your coca
Take advantage of my hours that are little '
When I pass' that door, my crazy
You're going to do what na 'of this matters to you
And end again with another
I don't even want to get your clothes
I stopped kissing 'on the mouth
I want the queen, not a four cup '
'Toy hot, and I'm cold
This void is not filled
Girl, complaint just a little bit
My heroine in this mess
'Toy hot, and I'm cold
This void is not filled
Girl, complaint
My heroine in this mess

[Bridge: Duki]
And if I tell you that this pity I feel
You can only get your kisses
And if I tell you that I can die Felí 'while it is the fault of your sex
And if I tell you that the rest looks at us
As if they were hating ours
And I see your face that you don't care about anything
As if I had been born for this

She is a devil
He sees me, kisses me, then he doesn't talk to me
Sex 'night, day' without words
I am lost because of that devil
She is a devil
He sees me, kisses me, then he doesn't talk to me
Sex 'night, day' without words
I am lost because of that devil

[Pre-stribe: khea]
He knows that I love her, but She Don't Give A Fo
Perhaps it is fear, but She Don't Give A Fo (Fo, Ey)
He wants someone with a future and without so much 'change' of humor (-mor, -mor, -mor, -mor)
Or that's what I think, but She Don't Give A Fo

[Chorus: khea]
She Don't Give A Fo, Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (Fo, Fo)
She Don't Give A Fo, Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (Fo, Fo)
She Don't Give A Fo, Baby (Fo, Fo), She Don't Give A Fo
She Don't Give A Fo, Baby, She Don't Give A Fo (Yeah)

[Verse 2: khea]
Do not do 'to look for you (who is going to look for you)
And tell you to 'what I feel (I feel)
Baby, I don't want to stop you (no)
I no longer reach time (ah-ah)
It is no longer the same as before '(ah-ah-ah)
Now I kill for your body (AH-AH-AH)
Now I kill your body (ah-ah)
Baby, I swear I don't lie
[Saying: khea]
And if you want to tell me (tell me)
Diabla, just tell me (oh)
I know there are plenty (oh, oh)
But there is always something that kills the two (the two)
And if you want to tell me (tell me)
Diabla, just tell me (tell me)
I know there are plenty (oh, oh)
But there is always something that kills the two (oh, oh)

[Outro: khea]
