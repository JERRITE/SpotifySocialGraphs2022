I’ll Always Remember You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I always knew this day would come
We'd be standing one by one
With our future in our hands
So many dreams, so many plans
I always knew after all these years
There'd be laughter, there'd be tears
But never thought that I'd walk away
With so much joy but so much pain
And it's so hard to say goodbye
[Chorus]
But yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

[Verse 2]
Another chapter in the book
Can’t go back, but you can look
And there we are on every page
Memories I'll always save
Up ahead, only open doors
Who knows what we're heading towards
I wish you love, I wish you luck
For you, the world just opens up
But it's so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you
You might also like[Bridge]
Every day that we had, all the good, all the bad
I'll keep them here inside
All the times that we shared, every place, everywhere
You touched my life
Yeah, one day we'll look back, we'll smile, and we'll laugh
But right now we just cry
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you5Embed
