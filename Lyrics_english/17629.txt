Freakey!, (Freakey! Freakey!)
Freakey!, Freakey! (Freakey! Freakey!)

[Verse 1]
Right, Han
You need comas
Yah, you need sums
Right, I am the 'llets-bi'
Yah, the Schnecks they are divine
Shit, Schnecks I whistle them quickly
It takes 1k per minute
Smoke my bitch cannabis
Rolex is vintage
[Chorus]
Bé-Bé-Bé-Bé-Bé-Bébé, make me love
Dior, Drippin, sneakers John Galliano
Negro leaves the Shenron, Negro releases the Draco
We don't come from the same areas, life does not give a gift
Baby, make me love
LV on the wallet, checkerboard on the flag
Dior, Drippin, Baskеts John Galliano
Negro leaves the Shenron, Negro releases the Draco, (Draco, Draco)

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
Bé-Bé-Bé-Bé-Bé-Bébé, make me love
Dior, Drippin, Baskеts John Galliano
Negro leaves the Shenron, Negro releases the Draco
We don't come from the same areas, life does not give a gift
Baby, make me love
LV on the wallet, checkerboard on the flag
Dior, Drippin, sneakers John Galliano
Negro leaves the Shenron, Negro releases the Draco, (Draco, Draco)

[Outro]
