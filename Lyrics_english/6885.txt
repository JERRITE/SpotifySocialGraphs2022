Sad Days lyrics [lyrics "Sad Days"]

[Chorus: Shiawase]
Cold outside the window, but your hands warm
I need snowfalls, they dissolve me
These thoughts about loss are just killing me
There are nightmares in my head, I always curse them
Miraculously did not go crazy, although I do not believe in miracles
I feel broken by lying at five in the morning
I am looking for you everywhere with my eyes, I miss you
This separation between us makes love stronger
[Verse 1: Shiawase]
There are so many pills in me - I forget who I am
I'm tired of problems, leave me alone
I'll kill myself, because my life is not worth it
I'll kill myself, because I am not worthy
My days pass, I am a rot in my room
How I would like to be in your warmth
I would like to be with you
But once again I fill myself with poison

[Verse 2: 2105]
How much will I stretch out without you? (I will stretch it without)
I don't know how much, but I drink to the bottom
I drink, believe me have nothing to lose (there is nothing to lose, lose)
Run away, don't remember (no)
Don't remember those days
I have drugs, but this is temporary
But this is temporary, I need time, yes
I need time, yes, but you know what I
I'm a clown on stage, I write a terrible song
In which we are not destined to be together with you
I am uninteresting, delete and millet
I'm afraid of skyscrapers, and you are afraid of entrances

[Chorus: Shiawase]
Cold outside the window, but your hands warm
I need snowfalls, they dissolve me
These thoughts about loss are just killing me
There are nightmares in my head, I always curse them
Miraculously did not go crazy, although I do not believe in miracles
I feel broken by lying at five in the morning
I am looking for you everywhere with my eyes, I miss you
This separation between us makes love stronger thanyou might also like1embed
