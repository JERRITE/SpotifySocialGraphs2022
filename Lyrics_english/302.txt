Brandy Sippinâ€™ LyricsBaby listen
Right here with you it's where a nigga wanna be
Just let me heal your pain
Anytime you feel sad I'll be your remedy
It's Yo Trane, look
You know I'm down for you, yeah
I'm just sayin'
You're stuck in my brain
Your love is in my veins
I wanna be down with you
Can't think of anyone else but you
These lame bitches can't compare to you
It's the weekend, I been drinkin' XO
Brandy liquor shawty's sippin' it slow
Now we in the zone, and she wanna get blown
Baby hit this blunt with me
Let me give you what you need
Right by your side it's the only place I wanna be
Just let me heal your pain
Maybe all you need is a shoulder to cry on
Anytime you feel sad I'll be your remedy
It's Yo Trane, look
More than you ever could dream of
Down with you
Down with you
Yeah I wanna be down
I'm just sayin' you're stuck in my brain
Your love is in my veins
I wanna be down with youYou might also likeEmbed
