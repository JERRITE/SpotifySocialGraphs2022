What mia Lyrics [text of "what my"]

[Intro: Guè Pequeno & Marracash]
Yeah
Eh-eh
Ah-ah
Seh, Seh, Seh
G-U-is
Marracash
Milan
Santher
Ah
What mine
And so be it
[Refrain: Marracash & Guè Pequeno]
These people these roads are my thing (what my)
This style, this basis, is my thing (what my)
Both in winter and in summer, it is my thing (what my)
Don't explain to me what to do in my house
The people of the road speak street language
The language of the road is my language (my language)
The people of the road speak street language (Okay)
The language of the road is my language (my language)

[Verse 1: marracash]
Guè has known me since I was not storing pieces, I sold pieces
I stole vehicles, goods, small bizes like Renzi's half a point of GDP
I raided the hip hop scene like Bope in a favela (power-power)
I made Barona famous and feared like Kim Jong Korea (Yeah-Yeah)
There is no story like History Channel, Tandem Simply the Best, Tina Turner
Fra ', in my life I have never voted, I swear
Better the monarchy, which was enough to kill one
Unemployment at the forty more or less is like cutting, the bamba (Okay) on the street
It is clear that if you cut the seats it is as if you deforest, sooner or later avalanche
Popular as Japigia in Bari, outside people already press (already press)
They are hot and they are fresh like on the shoreline (shoreline)
As a father I am disgusted this scene is my daughter
And it is plastic and makes the slut like the daughter, Fra ', of Caniggia
Ganci, Rocky, Grand Cherokee, teenocchi, Fra ', with Marra and Guèpek
Removals, fuck rockit, dolls like Benji and Fedez
From the neighborhood the rap is my thing
So Trap, I speak Trapani type: Rosalia

These people these roads are my thing (what my)
This style, this basis, is my thing (what my)
Both in winter and in summer, it is my thing (what my)
Don't explain to me what to do in my house

The language of the road is my language (my language)
The people of the road speak street language (Okay)
The language of the road is my language (my language) (G-U-è)

[Verse 2: Guè Pequeno]
Imagine Guè while the fresh counts, eats belly
Sorry for Dante's rhyme but, when rappo, he is always fish in his mouth, ball on his head
I break the heart to these girls, they go into depin 'like Adele
Bro, go to K.O., then you say they ducked you the glass (haha)
'Sti rapper are no balls (zero) like Ken Barbie's husband
The brothers here know how to get by sell you Sassi, also Moncler Falsi (Okay)
But here there is no catharsis, sisters who make lap dance until late (ah-ah)
So many years that I make 'sti bang that I don't have to introduce myself anymore (Seh)
I'm around all night because it is in the darkness that a star shines
Those good guys really frequent, you only saw goodfellas (ah)
You who talk to me about hip hop, style, flow and beautiful company
It is like Suarez when he asks Tony Montana if he melts from Barella (Uh)
Serious return to the classic stereo flow Fa Stravinsky
Stravizi, you run to the park we run risks, pass a girl down, whistle
Call on 3310, crossed, ancient Greeks
Low cost life (low cost), lacoste on shirts and salaries in machines
[Refrain: Guè Pequeno & Marracash, Marracash]
These people these roads are my thing (what my)
This style, this basis, is my thing (what my)
Both in winter and in summer, it is my thing (what my)
Don't explain to me what to do in my house
The people of the road speak street language
The language of the road is my language (my language)
The people of the road speak street language (Okay)
The language of the road is my language (my language) embed
