Survive My Own Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can we just slow down?
I feel lately there is no time
My heart beats fast but my
Next dose isn't 'til nine
So one, two, three, deep breaths, and
Five ways to help reconnect
As my mind keeps trying to ground my body's unrest

[Chorus]
I don't think I'm someone that I recognize
I no longer think I'm on my own side
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind
I think I'm just doing my best to get by
Something feels off, yeah, it doesn't feel right
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind
[Verse 2]
Surrounded by people but I'm out of body
Keep conversation flow but I can hardly
Tell myself that they won't notice if I leave the party
I need to leave the party
And here's the thing
The problem doesn't seem to be this place or what I'm wearing
It's harder that I can't point exactly why I'm anxious
Everything is fine but I still want to escape it
I can't take it

[Chorus]
I don't think I'm someone that I recognize
I no longer think I'm on my own side
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind
I think I'm just doing my best to get by
Something feels off, yeah, it doesn't feel right
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind

[Post-Chorus]
Survive my own mind
To survive my own mind
(It's getting harder and harder)
To survive my own mind
(It's getting harder and harder)
To survive my own mind
(It's getting harder and harder)
To survive my own mind
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't think I'm someone that I recognize
I no longer think I'm on my own side
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind
(To survive my own mind)
I think I'm just doing my best to get by
Something feels off, yeah, it doesn't feel right
I feel like I am just tryna survive
Survive my own mind
(Survive my own mind)Embed
