â€‹tip toes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Demanding my mind be set free
From wanting the things I don't need
My pride is hiding its lies behind all the dreams
Living inside
(Woo, hey)
(Woo, hey)
Delusion is weighing me down
It's taking the hope that I found
And giving me nothing back
Heart attack, so now I'm on my
[Pre-Chorus]
Tip toes, trying to see past my ego
Reaching for something more than
This feeling of being important
Leaving my heart behind, it's bleeding
But still my pride is screaming
My future will listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me

[Chorus]
Will I always know this divide?
Living host to this war inside
Take this ghost of me with the tide to die
And release my heart to come alive (Hey, hey!)

[Verse 2]
The feeling is creeping in slow
It's feeding my need to be known
And giving me nothing back
Heart attack, so now I'm on my (Hey, woo)
Heart attack, so now I'm on my (Hey, woo)
Heart attack, so now I'm on my

[Pre-Chorus]
Tip toes, trying to see past my ego
I'm reaching for something more than
This feeling of being important
Leaving my heart behind, it's bleeding
But still my pride is screaming
My future will listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me

Will I always know this divide?
Living host to this war inside
Take this ghost of me with the tide to die
And release my heart to come alive
Will I always know this divide?
Living host to this war inside
Take this ghost of me with the tide to die
And release my heart to come alive (Hey!)

[Interlude]
Woo, hey
Woo, hey
Woo, hey, hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my tip toes, trying to see past my ego
Reaching for something more than
This feeling of being important
Leaving my heart behind, it's bleeding
But still my pride is screaming
My future will listen to me
Listen to me
I'm on my tip toes, trying to see past my ego
Reaching for something more than
This feeling of being important
Leaving my heart behind, it's bleeding
But still my pride is screaming
My future will listen to me
Listen to me
[Outro]
Listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey!12Embed
