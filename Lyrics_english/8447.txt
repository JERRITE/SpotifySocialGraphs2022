Jealous cat lyrics ["jealous cat" ft. Héctor & Tito]

You do want this, take that I have
Whatever you want from me, of me (Azota me!)
Come, slow perrea, take movement
Come, jealous cat for me, for me (uhg, uhg!)
You do want this, take that I have
Whatever you want from me, of me (hard, hard, hmm!)
Come, slow perrea, take movement
Come, jealous cat for me, for me
Perreo, Papi, Perreo (Azota me!)
Perreo, Papi, Perreo (Azota me!)
Perreo, Papi, Perreo (Azota me!)
Hard hard
Hard hard

She and 'my jealous cat, my culinary cuchi-cuchi
I am the hitman and she and 'my sicaria
And if the little boy is around the area
Vamo 'to break his cacaria vein
I like how she tempts me and touches me
How my jealous cat is enjoyed
She is a bandit, she and 'something else
And he always asks me if I have a wife, girl
Jealous cat, leave ignorance (uhg!)
That I want to whip you and that 'are my cans (ah!)
If I manage to catch you and give you the substance (uhg!)
They are going to pick you up, mommy in ambulance (ah!)

And I ask you, do you like when Héctor touches you? (Azota me!)
Take, jealous cat (HMM-HMM-HMM)
And I ask you, do you like when Héctor touches you? (Azota me!)
Take, jealous cat (HMM-HMM-HMM)

Look for my gaze and my body that makes you bad
I know you want to love me
But I owe
Hey, jealous cat
Look for my gaze and my body that makes you bad
I know you want to love me
But I owe
Hey, jealous cat

My jealous cat is a businesswoman
It is always pending to my bank account
She does not fantasize, it looks like a hood
Has Pal de Amigas and I have thrown several
She seduces me intelligence
Pal of friends of them asked clemency
When I touch it, it does not make me resistance
And if the whip collect it in emergency

And I ask you if Valentino touches you?
(Peat me)
Take jealous cat
And I ask you if Valentino touches you?
(Peat me)
Take jealous cat
Look for my gaze and my body that makes you bad
I know you want to love me
But I owe
Hey, jealous cat
Look for my gaze and my body that makes you bad
I know you want to love me
But I owe
Hey, jealous cat
