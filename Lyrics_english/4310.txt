The day you caress me, I will cry Lyricsi, you will ask why I love you so much 
 Neither I know why, neither I know why 
 But I love you 
 I don't think you hurt you with love you 
 It doesn't matter if you don't love me 

 I'm used to your contempt 
 That the day you caress me I will cry 
 I love you so much 
 That even if you want 
 Leaving you forget 
 If you wanted to leave me 
 You would have echoed at once 
 But even you understand 
 That another is very difficult to find love 
 That in exchange for your despises you of your love 
 And a thousand more things 

 I tell you that your contemptions 
 I have become accustomed and it is the truth 
 And that just to see you and be by your side 
 I live very happy love 
 That I suffer when I look at you that you are very sad 
 And I think it's for Miyou Might Also Likeembed
