She’s The Prettiest Girl at the Party, and She Can Prove It With a Solid Right Hook Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got my bags all packed and I’m ready to go
I’m standing outside of your figurative door
And I’m ready for the flight or to fall off a cliff
But if it’s alright with you I’d rather not miss out on us
'Cause your face is all I need to stay sane
I’ve spent my life getting in my own way
So I could use something good, I really need this to work out
'Cause the way things have been going, it might be smarter to just cash out

[Shortened Chorus]
You’re on my mind
And things that you say hurt me
Most of the time
But I’m sinking fast, it’s alright
[Verse 2]
I’ve tied my stomach in knots and I’m ready to know
I’ll put it on the line if you’d just give it a go
'Cause I wanna be the only one to hold you so close and so tight
If it’s cool with you, I’d really love to spend the night
You say you never wanna be saved
Well, that’s okay 'cause I wouldn’t know how
Just know that the best that I’ll ever be
Is whatever you make me and wherever you are

[Chorus]
You’re on my mind
And things that you say hurt me
Most of the time
But I’m on your side
'Cause I know I’m not easy to deal with sometimes
But I’m sinking fast, it’s alright

[Bridge]
All we wanted was what we were
And what we were was young and naive
I found my place in this world
It’s in your wake, in your wake, in your wake

[Chorus]
You’re on my mind
And things that you say hurt me
Most of the time
But I’m on your side
'Cause I know I’m not easy to deal with sometimes
But once in a while
I wish you would tell me if you even care
As I’m sinking fast
I'm sinking fast
And I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you to know I’m alrightYou might also like18Embed
