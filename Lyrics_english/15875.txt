I'm looking for Lyricsletra "I'm looking for" ft. 21st floor
[Intro: Floor 21]
Jee
Carlos Baute
Singing to him
21st floor
Get on, get out, go on

[Verse 1: Carlos Baute]
I don't know very well
Where are you
I'll look for you
I am sure that
I'll find you
Wherever you are
[Pre-Coro: Carlos Baute, 21st floor]
Love Come CÃºme my wounds oh, oh
I hope you are not lost my life oh, oh
I have no end to find your love
I know I hurt you
And today I am in prison of pain

[Coro: Carlos Baute, 21st floor]
I'm looking for
A love that takes me to heaven
And get me out of this hell
That the past left me ay ay

I'm looking for
I live with faith to find you
Only you can fill
This emptiness that the past left
Ay ay ay
As Baby says

[Post-car: Floor 21]
Oa oa oa
Come tell tell me what you love me
Oa oa oa
Come tell tell me what you love me
Oa oa oa
Oh what love me

Looking for a woman, wanting to have you
To be able to touch your skin, lose myself in your body
Keep dancing slowly
LEAVE THE TWO OH MAMI
Don't hide more than me I find you
Look what is the time to wear feelings
Your kisses are my delirium
Save me from that void

[Pre-Coro: Carlos Baute, 21st floor]
Do not play the hidden oh oh
I hope you are not lost my life oh oh
I will not get tired of looking for this love
I know I hurt you and today I am imprisoned for pain


[Chorus: ]
I'm looking for
A love that takes me to heaven
And get me out of this hell
That the past left me ay ay

I'm looking for
I live with faith to find you
Only you can fill
This emptiness that the past left
Ay ay ay
As Baby says
[Post-car: Carlos Baute, floor 21]
Oa oa oa
Come tell tell me what you love me
Oa oa oa
Come tell tell me what you love me
Oa oa oa
Come tell tell me what you love me
Oa oa oa
Oh what love me

I'm looking for this love
I'm looking for
I'm looking for this love
I'm looking for this love
I'm looking for
I'm looking for this love

[Outro: Floor 21]
I'm looking for
Carlos Baute singing to him
