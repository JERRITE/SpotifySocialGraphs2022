I am going to kiss you tonight (Beep Beep) Lyrics [verse 1]
I got to the party, and where are you?
I went out today to look for you
Time can end
I have to find you
I will not wait one more day
Tonight will pass

[Chorus]
I'm going to kiss you tonight
Don't hesitate, I'm going to find you
I'm going to kiss you tonight
I don't care that I can happen
Tonight will never be forgotten
[Verse 2]
You are thinking about me
You want to tell me something
Your eyes don't know how to lie
Don't try to hide it
I knew since I saw you
That you would come to me

[Chorus]
I'm going to kiss you tonight
Don't hesitate, I'm going to find you
I'm going to kiss you tonight
I don't care that I can happen
Tonight will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
I'm going to kiss you tonight
Don't hesitate, I'm going to find you
I'm going to kiss you tonight
I don't care that I can happen
Tonight will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
I'm going to kiss you tonight
Don't hesitate, I'm going to find you
I'm going to kiss you tonight
I don't care that I can happen
Tonight you will never forget Might Also Likeembed
