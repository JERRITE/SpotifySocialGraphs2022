The trap is law Lyrics [letter of "the trap is law"]

[Chorus: Lit Killah & Chaqueño Palavecino]
In your mouth I bit the carmine apple of desire and temptation
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse
When I touched his body I made an addiction (OH-OH-OH)
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse
In its trap I fell, the apple bit from desire and temptation
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse
When I touched his body I made an addiction (OH-OH-OH)
He made me try his poison and now I can't— (mmm-mmm)
[Verse 1: lit killah]
I want to pass it to search 'in a BM
To be able to have it between four stops'
She is not the same as you who many in the Rede '
What s should? I know what you want
Luxury life, travel 'and Hotele'
Go out in Magazine 'And go on TV
A spider that caught me in his Rede '
For what is this? For what is this?
Ey (uh), she asks me to stay and I want to take it
He started his game and I don't know when he's going to '(lit)

[Chorus: Lit Killah]
In its trap I fell, the apple bit from desire and temptation
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse
When I touched his body I made an addiction (OH-OH-OH)
It made me try his poison and now I can't—

[Verse 2: Lit Killah]
She as Eva, I like Adam
No one takes it, few give it
Two stick to him, it's like a magnet
And sends the shit who wants to flash
What goes up to Tiktok puts a good filter and at the touch it is viral
Tie-tie-has to go out with Paragua 'because they are raining the like'
She is a bitchie but I saw her first with an angelic face
'Ta-~ ~ ~ `taba good from the eighteen and now turned twentystitré' like Mike (Mike)

[Chorus: Lit Killah & Chaqueño Palavecino]
In your mouth I bit the carmine apple of desire and temptation
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse (no, no, no)
When I touched his body, an addiction was made (-cion)
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse (lit)
In its trap I fell, the apple bit from desire and temptation (temptation)
He made me try his poison and now I can't with the curse
When I touched his body I made an addiction (OH-OH-OH)
It made me try his poison and now I can't with the curses nebed
