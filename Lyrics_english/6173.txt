Photos & Liquor Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blue light from the TV
Blinding and I can't see what's in front of me
Head is killing me, yeah
Mirrors on the ceiling
Painting what I'm missing
How'd I end up here?
And when'd you disappear? Well

[Chorus]
The flashbacks are mixed up with photos and liquor
Cloudin' my mind with what was real and what's fiction
My love, yeah
My love, oh
Blur of the rose-tinted memories so vivid
Pictures so perfect, I want to live in 'em
My love
My love
[Post-Chorus]
On and on and off again
On and on and off again

[Verse 2]
Several frames of a story
Only capture the glory
There's no record of
Falling out of love, mmm
Room keys and those long nights
Hangin' over your side
Trapped in history
Stop, rewind, repeat, yeah

[Chorus]
The flashbacks are mixed up with photos and liquor
Cloudin' my mind with what was real and what's fiction
My love, yeah
My love, oh
Blur of the rose-tinted memories so vivid
Pictures so perfect, I want to live in 'em
My love
My love

[Bridge]
Wake up, smiling
Roll over, invite me
Still in a dream
Tangled in your sheets
Starfish and coffee
The smell of your sun-kissed body
Movin' over me
Taste the ocean breeze
You might also like[Chorus]
The flashbacks are mixed up with photos and liquor
Cloudin' my mind with what was real and what's fiction
My love
My love
Blur of the rose-tinted memories so vivid
Pictures so perfect, I want to live in 'em
My love
My love

[Post-Chorus]
On and on and off again
On and on and off again
My love
My love, oh

[Chorus]
The flashbacks are mixed up with photos and liquor
Cloudin' my mind with what was real and what's fiction
My love, yeah
My love, oh
Blur of the rose-tinted memories so vivid
Pictures so perfect, I want to live in 'em
My love
My love
[Outro]
On and on and off again
On and on and off again
My love
On and on and on and on and off again
My love
My love1Embed
