I will always be Lyrics [lyrics by "I will always be" ft. Pacho el Antifeka & Secret "The famous bottle"]

[Intro: Myke Towers, Tempo, Farruko and Secret "The famous bottle"]
One, Two, One, Two
Before 'I judge' or Marginarno '
You have to check where you see '
This is dedicated to everyone who came from below, just like N forotro '
He he
You Got To Be Ready for This One, Man
The street made me man by force of a singing '
If I were not imprisoned, they would have given me a couple of plumb '
You can get a man out of the street
But not the street of a man
And even if I moved away from the street
The street knows my name
[Chorus: Farruko and Secret "The famous bottle"]
I am and I will always be a bandit
From envy and betrayal I always take care (I always take care of me)
I learned that in the street there are no friends (you know no)
Do not believe that I am removes, with the 'open' eye I follow

[Verse 1: Myke Towers]
Young Kingz, Nigga
Being bandit is not just killing and selling drugs
It is knowing that for the finest thing is that the rope part
I want if I'm dying, say he always played alive
I see everything and nothing say, the bad intention 'I perceive them
And this is my way of being
I will be in the same way if I be born again
Where do I come from there are no options, pa ', there is not much to do
I climbed price like kilo 'when there is shortage
My name will always be clear because I run with ethics
And by Chamaquito Joseaba for not having a replica
Be careful that what is' smoking is not synthetic (haha)
I greet all 'Los Malandro' in Latin America
And I continue to pay, that God my path enlighten (Amen)
That everything 'mine' is well the day this culminates (Amen)
They ride, they know that they can't sink me
Below water they want to confuse me

[Choir: Myke Towers & Secret "The famous Biberon"]
But I am and will always be a bandit (bandit)
From envy and betrayal I always take care (I always take care of me)
I learned that in the street there are no friends' (You know no)
Now we live as a boss' and drug we never sold

(AHA)
The September venticinco was born a bandit
It has not been easy (ah-ah), but I have seen my dream 'fulfilled' (wuh)
I ask God that they have those who have not believed (Amen)
And that my soldier 'fallen' fly high
I have learned to forgive, to swallow, to shut up
And to give it myself because if not nobody will give it to you
I wanted to change, but I didn't know if this was going to work
Because in my subconscious mind I really wanted to win (Wuh)
I wanted the easy money and I was the bandit of which Don spoke
And even if I am since I am facing high
And I'm going to take it out because if you know the code '(ey)
And yet it turns you '(ey), because I don't give it to you (uh)
I am in a stage of my life where I have seen the false that hugs you (aha), the bad 'vibrates' back
If it is to find it 'out there and infect myself of envy and betrayal, I better stay at home (AH-AH)

[Verse 3: Secret "The famous bottle"]
Mommy mommy)
I just ask you to pray for me
Because I'm going to the street (I do)
Because I'm going to the street (UH-UH)
I'm going to the street and I'm alone
Mato alone and rolled alone, I do
And I was born to be a bandit, a criminal
Oh, mommy, pray for me
I closed a lot of 'Puerta', but I'm still here
Pulling pa'lante, I didn't give up (I didn't give up)
That 'same' that are next to you (uh, uh)
They are the first 'that talk about you
[Chorus: Farruko and Secret "The famous bottle"]
Farru!
I am and I will always be a bandit
From envy and betrayal I always take care (I always take care of me)
I learned that in the street there are no friends (you know no)
Do not believe that I am removes, with the 'open' eye I follow

[Verse 4: Pacho el Antifeka, Pacho el Antifeka & Farruko]
I will always be a bandit
Being alive, being imprisoned, being dead
Of those who run the case and go up the aueropuerto
I made a million million 'and mine' are resolved '
For the music I am Pacho and for the bosses I am the one -eyed
I am a street and with the street my family I beg
They took me with the cut eight combs and fulfilled them
I killed insects if I got off and turned on Flipper
Now I'm dual, lower the check and sign the split
I changed jobs, I didn't change my heart
I'm still a bandit with the piece 'and not Autozone's'
Twenty -seven on the street, twenty -seven in prison
I am the most real thing you are going to listen to in a song
The street knows well what I give
I have nothing to show them
To me God guide me and that God keeps you, Yeih, Yeh
Where do I come from and where I am from
Not made pa 'cowards
I live life without fear, I am a bandit like Don and Calde

[Verse 5: Farruko]
Fa-rru!
Bandit is not the one that shoots' nor the one who puts hand (bum)
A bandit does not betray the loyalty of a brother
I don't trust a man ', I don't believe in the name' or in a guy
Here is the same, we are human beings' (OE)
Do not under anyone's head, just Jesus Christ
He knows my heart and what my eye 'have seen (Amen)
Do not put a man tested, bastard, don't underestimate me '
You won't save the money or baqueo that leads you '
I am the singer and mine is singing
But I grew up in the street and I don't void
They say I'm a bandit (because I respected)
I am a street and so I stay until the day of my funeral

[Chorus: Farruko and Secret "The famous bottle"]
I am and I will always be a bandit
Of envy and betrayal I always take care
I learned that there are no friends on the street
And although now it is rankea'o, with the 'open' eye sigo (ah-ah)
I am and I will always be a bandit
From envy and betrayal I always take care (I always take care of me)
I learned that in the street there are no friends (you know no)
Do not believe that I am removes, with the 'open' eye I follow
