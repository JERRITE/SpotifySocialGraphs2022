Fuct Up Kid Lyrics(VERSE:)
The words you say I'll never listen to
Cause if I did I'd be just like you
Cause you're my enemy and soon you're gonna see
You gotta be yourself to be happy
Cause you're not, you're not

(CHORUS:)
Fucked up visions in my head
I'm a fucked up kid is what they said
But at least I know all the things that I want
And it's all the things I got
(VERSE:)
Cause you're so quick to point the finger
You act like your shit don't linger
It feels good when you see someone else in a rut
It gives you confidence it makes you happy but
You're not, you're not

(CHORUS:)
Fucked up visions in my head
I'm a fucked up kid is what they said
But at least I know all the things that I want
And it's all the things I got

(BRIDGE:)
Cause you act as if you see my way
But I know that you won't leave today
Cause change is what you fear the most
That the end is getting close
And the end is getting close
And the end is getting close

(CHORUS:)
Fucked up visions in my head
I'm a fucked up kid is what they said
But at least I know all the things that I want
It's all the things I got
You might also likeFucked up visions in my head
I'm a fucked up kid is what they said
But at least I know all the things that I want
And it's all the things I got
And it's all the things I got
And it's all the things I gotEmbed
