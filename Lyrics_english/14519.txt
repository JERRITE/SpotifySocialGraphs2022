Yamefui Lyrics [lyrics by "Yamefui"]

[Chorus: Duki]
If you are listening to this, I already left
I know I am worse than you, but I was your learner '
If you are listening to this, it is because I already left
I know I am worse than you, but I was your learner '

[Verse 1: duki]
Baby, I hope you understand
That I do not just name you all 'that' fool '
In his mouth your name is great, it 'eat alone'
A chance, it's not too late
If it is with you, we are going to be fine
It's my beautiful, like Frodo's еl
Fight 'with life back behind back, side by side
Hagamo 'that is more obvious what they know everything'
I later I laugh 'when I am' alone '
If you want to go, you have the door
But I ask you to leave her open
When better, better not appear '
When is worse, better not to grow '
[Saying: duki]
I give you my time to see you
You are thinking about what you are going to do on Friday
Cortemo 'The thread, we are different style

[Verse 2: Nicki Nicole]
Who am I, is asking your mai
I am not what they say out there
Over and go down like lowride
I feel good in a GTI, Yeah (EY-YEAH)
Higher, have Style so different
I so nicki, you Tyga
Baby, give me lu '
Although there is another, the best ere 'you
I love you, baby, you 'tá crazy
He knows 'that I am giving catechési' to the 'saint'
I love you, baby, you 'tá crazy
I perreo alone, like Nesi
You, since you are not more than two
I follow the runways' of Blue, uh
And I can't find you
And the worst e 'I see you in all' part '

[Saying: Duki & Nicki Nicole]
I give you my time to see you
You are thinking about what you are going to do on Friday
Cortemo 'The thread, we are different style
And I thought you were different
And defended you from what people said
It is no longer the same, you killed him with your selfishness
You Might Also Like [Chorus: Duki]
If you are listening to this, I already left
I know I am worse than you, but I was your learner '
If you are listening to this, it is because I already left
I know I am worse than you, but I was your learner '

[Verse 3: duki]
Money Moves, Bloody Shoes
Who does not have its sin?
On My Mood, Comin 'Through
Bitch, I Started from The Bottom
I don't know you, but I
'Toy tired of being so bad
What I have I give you
My time I give you

[Outro]
It's a wrap7embed
