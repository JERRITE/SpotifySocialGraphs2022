Let Me Love You (Joe Stone Remix) LyricsBaby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was you're man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you, you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby you should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby you should let me love you
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know

If I was you're man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you, you are

Give you everything you want and need
