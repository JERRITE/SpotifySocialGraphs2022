That life comes to me.
So much clarity, so much fantasy
So much passion, so much imagination
And both give love until the day arrives
So many ways to say I love you
What you give me does not seem human

Every wish that you guess me
Every time you laugh, you break my routine
And the patience with which you listen to me
And the conviction with which you always fight
How do you fill me like you release me
I want to be with you if I was born again
I ask God to reach my life
And I go back to return
Even just a little
How much you give me
I ask God to reach my life
To tell you everything I feel thanks to your love

The feeling that I'm not me
And that there is something else when you look at me
The feeling that there is no time

When your hands are on my cheeks
How do you fill me like you release me
I want to be with you if I was born again

I ask God to reach my life
And I go back to return
Even just a little
How much you give me
I ask God to reach my life
To tell you everything I feel thanks to your love

It gives me the light that makes awakening
That moves me away from darkness
That fills me with heat the world
So you don't lose course
You Might Also Likele ask God to reach my life
And I go back to return
Even just a little
How much you give me
I ask God to reach my life
To tell you everything I feel thanks to your love ... embed
