Jealous (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Tinashe]
Uh, mm
Nick J
Tinashe
It's the remix

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it
[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Tinashe]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Uh, listen
I'm the type to never sweat no chick (Chick, yeah)
Ain't nobody but you got me stressin' this way and you know (Know, know)
Yeah, yeah
Now the struggle's always real (Hey)
Girls be steppin' in my space (Space), all up in your face (Face)
How am I supposed to feel?
