Suicidal Dream Lyrics[Intro]
I dream about, how It's gonna end
Approachin’ me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want, my mind to be clear

[Verse 1]
People making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I’ll kill myself from holdin’ my breath
[Chorus]
My suicidal dream
Voices tellin’ me what to do
My suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

[Verse 2]
Help me, comfort me
Stop me from feelin’, what I'm feelin’ now
The rope is here
Now I'll find a use
I'll kill myself
I'll put my head in a noose

[Chorus]
My suicidal dream
Voices tellin’ me what to do
My suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

[Outro]
Dreamin’ about my death, dream
Suicidal
Suicidal
Suicidal dream
I’m suicidal
