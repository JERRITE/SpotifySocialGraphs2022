The melody with the street
Tony Dize

[Pre-Caro: Tony Dize & Bad Bunny]
Baby, give me the signal
If you keep looking at me like this, I will kiss you, I will kiss you (I will kiss you)
If it's with you, I don't have to think (no, no)
[Choir: Tony Dize & Bad Bunny]
Because you are not like another ', no
You are different (huh, h)
Living the crazy life
Always against the current
What does it want to you, win, ah-ah-ah
Always Pichea ', Men' If Perreo calls (hehe), llama, ah-ah-ah (ey, ey)

[Verse 1: bad bunny]
I want you to teach me ', it's' my teacher, hehe
A bit, a pitcher, ey
Lowkey, walks Switche, heh
Crazy that I chi—
Hey, hey, the baby is already going to be violent, he looks violent
He is looking, I realized, I already realized, ah-ah
She knows more that you, so it's not 'silly, boy, don't lie to him', heh
Do not live the movie, that she is the movie and of which you do not rent
Upload that ass and to's comment
A bad bitch, girl of the '90
That bittersweet face is the one that tempts me
A picky, a mint
Pa 'mame it and break it
Under pa 'your court and wachartela
If your friend wants, go, invite her
Go, invite it, to be done

[Verse 2: Tony dize & bad bunny, both]
You are one of those who leaves
Late at night, but without being seen (no, no)
It was left and will not return (Nah, Nah)
Now it's better single
It leaves without arrival time, they say nothing
Does what he wants (he does what he wants)
The street set out 'in Candela (Ey, Ey)
And instead of getting angry, he prefers to play alone, huh, eh
It seems Colombian, they say "La Parce"
You don't need a pa 'ticket to look for
She lives it dancing, oh, oh
He has to 'the album looking, huh, huh

[Choir: Tony Dize & Bad Bunny]
Because you are not like others, no
You are different (ey, ey)
Living crazy life (living crazy life)
Always against the current (Ey, Ey)
You do 'what you want, win, ah-ah-ah
Always Pichea ', Men' If Perreo calls, calls, ah-ah-ah
