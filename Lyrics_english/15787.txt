Neither war nor peace lyricsamor, fantasy exhausted me
I don't know how to win your heart;
I am faithful to you, I give you the tastes
And you are so unfair
That even a kiss bothers you

Because when I ask if you love me
You always change my conversation
Is that there is another or is boredom
I no longer trust
And for me you don't die
Neither war nor peace
I do not want to see you anymore
I convinced myself that I will not make you happy;
Neither war nor peace
That little you give me
Forgive me if I fell in love

Because I get inflicted with you one day
If something told me better not
Let it pass by
That another fool takes over
But you seduced me

I thought that little by little you would love me
That you could not live far from me
But he has no remedy
You never took me seriously
Make your life and me mine

Neither war nor peace
I do not want to see you anymore
I convinced myself that I will not make you happy;
Neither war nor peace
That little you give me
Forgive me if I fell in love

I do not want to see you anymore
I convinced myself that I will not make you happy;
Neither war nor peace
That little you give me
Forgive me if I fell in love
