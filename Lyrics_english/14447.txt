Cyclone Lyrics [Text of "Cyclone" ft. Mariah, Gipsy Kings, Nicolás Reyes & Tonino Baliardo]

[Intro: Elodie]
I will write to love you on the notes of an iPhone
I fix the wall so I won't call you even tonight
It's not worth it, it's August but you freeze
Even if it is useless

[Verse 1: mariah]
Yo He intention llamarte
But with mare to equivocarma
Contestas, me enredas
No quiero sor Vaina, te imaginas
Yo Moría Por Ti, no if you are por mi mi
Lo que quada claro es que
No nos funcionó
[Bridge 1: Elodie]
Before you
I was alone, I was mine
Everything was easier
Now in this madness
I learned to dance
One hundred days without meeting
I didn't think then I miss

[Pre-Crime: Elodie]
I will write to love you on the notes of an iPhone
I fix the wall so I won't call you even tonight
It's not worth it, it's August but you freeze
Even if it is useless

[Refrain: Elodie]
Plush to tell you yes, softly to tell you yes
Plush to tell you yes
Only tonight
Plush to tell you yes, softly to tell you yes
Just touch me
You are a shiver on my back
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
On my back

[Verse 2: mariah]
Mirando has the Pared, thinking en llamarte
Contestas, me enredas
No quiero sor Vaina, tú me remains
A veces full que yes, después me digo no
No you puedo llamar to quiera de ti

Before you
I was alone I was mine
Everything was easier
Now in this madness
I learned to dance
Zingara is the night to look for
You are a cyclone looking for my steps

[Pre-Crime: Elodie]
I will write to love you on the notes of an iPhone
I fix the wall so I won't call you even tonight
It's not worth it, it's August but you freeze
Even if it is useless

[Refrain: Elodie]
Plush to tell you yes, softly to tell you yes
Just touch me
You are a shiver on my back
On my back
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
On my back
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
On my backembed
