Down to Earth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can’t get no sleep
The moon, it knows I
Don’t want you to leave
I think you're divine, I
Left the old me
Just to be with you, I try
To be free with you
I’d fall back down to earth
So what you want?
[Pre-Chorus]
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly falling too soon
I’m happy we’re grown now
Don’t gotta love you on the low now
Can you hit me when you're home?
And I’ll come running back to you

[Chorus]
I need you to be
Myself again, I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work, I
Need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find

[Verse 2]
Of all the stars in the sky that burn
You are the one to bring me back to earth
See, you remind me where I came from
So when you're done with work
Just hit me, boy, I’ll slide
Meditate on you just for the high
Think we met before, another life
So when you want a round two, I could meet you outside
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly fallin' too soon
I’m happy we’re grown now
Don’t gotta love you on the low now
Can you hit me when you're home?
And I’ll come runnin' back to you

[Chorus]
I need you to be
Myself again, I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work, I
Need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find
I need you to be
Myself again, I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work, I
Need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find6Embed
