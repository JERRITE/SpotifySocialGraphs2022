Look Like Lyrics[Intro]
Yung Pinch in this woe
Ayy

[Chorus]
Used to hate me, but you nice now
Wonder what it is you like now, yeah
Feed me lies, thought I would bite, shit
What the fuck do I look like? Oh-whoa
They don't wanna pay the price now, no, no
They askin' me for advice now, whoa-whoa
What the fuck do I look like? (Do I look like?) Ayy
What the fuck do I look like? (What do I look like?) Oh-whoa
[Verse 1]
What the fuck do I look like to you?
Look me right inside my eyes and you tell me the truth
I wanna know, what kind of things do you see?
What makes you think you got a reason to be hating on me?
I wanna know, what's the matter with you?
Talkin' smack behind my back until I'm back in the room
Boy, you a ho, or a bitch if you will
I'ma tell ya how it is, don't give a shit how ya feel, no, no
Ain't ya mom, ain't ya dad, yeah, I don't care if you sad
You could spend all day crying at your pad, I ain't feel bad
I see right through your disguise, ain't shit getting by
Yung Pinch on the rise, yeah, oh


[Chorus]
Used to hate me, but you nice now
Wonder what it is you like now, yeah
Feed me lies, thought I would bite, shit
What the fuck do I look like? Oh-whoa
They don't wanna pay the price now, no, no
They askin' me for advice now, whoa-whoa
What the fuck do I look like? (Do I look like?) Ayy
What the fuck do I look like? (What do I look like?) Oh-whoa

[Verse 2]
What the fuck do I look like to you?
Look me right inside my eyes and you tell me the truth
I wanna know, how much pain do you see?
Could you tell my momma living every day on the streets?
I wanna know, does that matter to you?
Do you know what it's like to lose a parent or two?
Maybe you do, but you ain't nothing like me
Grandma raised me on her own, I'ma motherfuckin' G
Too many snakes in the grass, so I stay by the sand
Gotta watch my own ass every way that I can (Yeah, yeah)
Don't trust them boys when they say you the man
'Cause they might stab you in the back while they shaking your hand, oh-whoa
You might also like
[Chorus]
Used to hate me, but you nice now
Wonder what it is you like now, yeah
Feed me lies, thought I would bite, shit
What the fuck do I look like? Oh-whoa
They don't wanna pay the price now, no, no
They askin' me for advice now, whoa-whoa
What the fuck do I look like? (Do I look like?) Ayy
What the fuck do I look like? (What do I look like?) Oh-whoa

[Outro]
Used to hate me, but you nice now, yeah
Used to hate me, but you nice now (Now you nice now)
Wonder what it is you like now (Is you like now)
Feed me lies, thought I would bite, shit
What the fuck do I look like? Oh-whoa3Embed
