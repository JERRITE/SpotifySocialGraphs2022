TranslationEnglishdeutschojitos Lydos Lyrics [Lyrics for "Cute Ojitos"]

[Verse 1: li Saumet]
A long time ago I listen to the heart
And the day spend ', the Mese ’thinking about your smell (in your smell, in your smell)
The time has come to use reason
Before 'that it is late and unintentionally I start in Do' (part in Do ’)

[Pre-Caro: Li Saumet]
Before the sun rises, the accelerator sinks
Even if going without brake 'and loses control
Nothing we will be, you and I caress'
In the midst of time, without saying goodbye '
[Chorus: Li Saumet]
And just look at me (look at me) with those 'cute ’eye (cute’ (cute ’)
That with еso I am fine (-Toy well), today I was born again (born)

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
For a long time (time) that I don't grab anyone from the hand (hand)
For a long time (time) that I don't send "good morning, I love you" (I love you)
But, you have me 'tanga’o (tanga'o), I wrapped (wrapped)
I was on my way and I got lost (ey, ey)
My gaze changed when your eyes saw (your eyes I saw)
Bye-bee to the ass', nor did I say goodbye
I didn't look for you (-which), no (no), chocamo 'on the way
With your soul it is what I connect (-Necto)
Quiet, it doesn't have to be perfect, no
There is no sin (-cado) and mistake is beautiful
The error ’are pleacere '(-cere'), just like 'your kiss'

[Chorus: Li Saumet, Bad Bunny & Li Saumet]
And just look at me (look at me) with those 'cute' eye (cute '(cute')
That with that I am fine (-Toy well), today I have been born (born)
And just look at me (look at me) with those 'cute' eye (cute '(cute')
That with that I am fine (-Toy well), today I have been born (born)

[Interlude: Li Saumet & Bad Bunny]
You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

I don't let anyone
I just let your smile (-Risa)
And of the lunar cerquita of your mouth (mouth)
If I am crazy, you are Loquita (-quita)
But, Baby, like you there is no other, no (no)
I want to give you sunflower '(-Sole')
Go to the beach and look for you Caracole '
When I'm with you, I don't look at the role '(role')
Vamo 'to dance two hundred song' (-cione ')
No one puts me like you puts me '(puts')
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm
I speak to I gave 'and you ere' his answer
I learned that the 'cute' moment never cost
Like when you give me your gaze
And the sun its put, and the sun its put
Hey, hey, when I'm on top of you, from you
Mommy, I forget to ', to'
No one is missing here
Only you and me

[Pre-Caro: Li Saumet]
Before the sun rises, the accelerator sinks
Even if going without brake 'and loses control
Nothing we will be, you and I caress'
In the midst of time, without saying goodbye '
[Chorus: Li Saumet]
And just look at me (look at me) with those 'cute' eye (cute '(cute')
That with that I am fine (-Toy well), today I have been born (born)
And just look at me (look at me) with those 'cute' eye (cute '(cute')
That with that I am fine (-Toy well), today I have been born (born) 7embed
