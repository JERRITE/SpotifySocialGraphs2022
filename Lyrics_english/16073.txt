Memorized Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can one wrong turn give me new direction?
Can one false move bring you one true friend?
Could a stranger ever end up being you?
We took it back in all directions
Reaching out towards the door
Is there a message, a pathway of something more?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the quiet way you caught my eye
Oh, got enough to get you memorized
[Chorus]
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you

[Verse 2]
I told a story before I knew the ending
I got an answer before I heard the question
How did a stranger ever end up being you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the quiet way you caught my eye
Oh, got enough to get you memorized

[Chorus]
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to you
I found my way, I found my way to youYou might also like3Embed
