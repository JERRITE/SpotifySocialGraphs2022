Neither you nor anyone lyricShace very badly to raise my tension
In crushing my ambition, you continue like this, you'll see
I look at the clock, it's much later than yesterday
I would wait for you again and I will not, I will not

Where is our mistake without solution?
Were you the culprit or did I?
Neither you nor anyone, nobody can change me
A thousand bells sound in my heart
How difficult it is to apologize!
Not anyone, nobody can change me
Go from here, you didn't know how to understand
I only think about your good, it is not necessary to lie
How easy it is to torment after
But I will survive, I know I will be, I will survive

Where is our mistake without solution?
Were you the culprit or did I?
Neither you nor anyone, nobody can change me
A thousand bells sound in my heart
How difficult it is to apologize!
Not anyone, nobody can change me

[Instrumental]

A thousand bells sound in my heart
How difficult it is to apologize!
Not anyone, nobody can change me
Where is our mistake without solution?
Were you the culprit or did I?
Neither you nor anyone, nobody can change me
A thousand bells sound in my heart
How difficult it is to apologize!
Not anyone else can change meyou might also like3embed
