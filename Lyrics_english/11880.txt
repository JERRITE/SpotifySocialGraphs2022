Turn off and let's let Lyrics [intro: Camila]
That story that love does not hurt ...
Don't tell me love does not hurt
Don't tell me that it fills your heart, OH-OH-OH-OH

[Verse 1]
I already gave him a thousand laps
And the evidence confirmed it
Yours is pure language
So many words and little action
You will pay the account
What I gave you was never a favor
I want someone who loves me
And not your peace and love hashtags
[Pre-Caro: Camila & Juliana]
I'm not going to deny that I loved you
I'm not going to lie, I'll miss you
But there are wounds that heal and others that bleed
I will never believe that story that love does not hurt

[Chorus: Makis & Natalia]
Don't tell me love does not hurt
Don't tell me that it fills your heart, OH-OH-OH-OH
I no longer believe in stories
Don't tell me love does not die
Surely a song told you, OH-OH-OH-OH
So turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH
So turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH

[Verse 2: olga & juliana]
I saw you so irresistible
So great was the attraction
But now that I know you
My disappointment became bigger
I followed the rope
I never put a condition
I believed all your promises
All your lip and your rock and roll

[Pre-Caro: Camila Juliana]
I'm not going to deny that I loved you
I'm not going to lie, I'll miss you
But there are wounds that heal and others that bleed
I will never believe that story that love does not hurt

Don't tell me love does not hurt
Don't tell me that it fills your heart, OH-OH-OH-OH
I no longer believe in stories
Don't tell me that love does not die (he dies)
Surely a song told you, OH-OH-OH-OH
So turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH
So turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH

[Bridge: Ventino & (Olga)]
I no longer believe in you
I got tired of suffering
This love hurt me
But I turned off and left (I left)
I no longer believe in you
I got tired of suffering
This love hurt me
But I turned off and left

[Pre-car: Camila]
I'm not going to deny that I loved you
I'm not going to lie, I'll miss you
But there are wounds that heal and others that bleed
I never believed that story that love does not hurt

[Chorus: Makis, Natalia]
Don't tell me love does not hurt
Don't tell me that it fills your heart, OH-OH-OH-OH
I no longer believe in stories
Don't tell me that love does not die (he dies)
Surely a song told you, oh oh oh oh
So let's turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH (let's go)
So let's turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH (let's go)
So let's turn off and let's go, OH-OH-OH-OH (don't tell me that love does not hurt, surely a song told you)
So turn off and let's go
