2 Oceans Lyrics[Verse 1: Trevor Hall]
Swimming in two oceans
All that emotion
Drowning to survive (Oh)
The tides inside my mind
My hands are reaching out
How can I speak about (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Waves crashing on my body
I shiver from that cold, cold world
That old world
[Chorus: Trevor Hall & Marieme, Marieme]
You'll never survive if you don't try
To calm the waters on the inside
On the inside you're the moonlight
On the outside, gotta hold tight
Let the storm pass, yeah

[Chorus: Marieme, both]
Then you'll walk on water (Water)
Then you'll walk on water (Water)
Then you'll walk on water (Water)
Then you'll walk on water (Water)
Then you'll walk on water (Water)
Thеn you'll walk on water
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Marieme]
Balanced (Balanced), I'm challеnged (I'm challenged), I try
To shift the currents of my mind, oh
Don't suffer with the times
Don't settle for this cruel, cruel world
This old world

[Chorus: Trevor Hall & Marieme, Marieme]
You'll never survive if you don't try
To calm the waters on the inside
On the inside you're the moonlight
On the outside, gotta hold tight
Let the storm pass, yeah

How can I speak about it

When I'm drowning to survive, oh
Then you'll walk on water
The tides inside my mindEmbed
