CASH COW Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Last year won a bag, yeah, I got M's in advance (M's in advance)
Tryna cash out like a Cash App, I put cash in her hand (Put cash in her hand)
Talkin' foreign with no visa, put a shark on land (Shark on land)
Pourin' codeine out a freezer, I can feel it like a Xan' (Feel it like a Xan')
I know you want you some bands (Bands)
I'm havin' millions of fans (I'm havin' millions of fans)
Young GunWunna cool as a fan, yeah
Ten on a bitch, get a tan, yeah (Ten on a bitch, get a tan, yeah)
You broke, I can't hear what you sayin' (Sayin')
We spin the whole block, I ain't playin' (Spin the whole block, I ain't playin')
We hunt the boy like a bloodhound
When they showed up, it's a man down (Pew, pew, pew)
[Chorus]
Wow, need to take care like a cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain
Wow, need to take care like a cash cow
Penthouse suite at the top of the mountain

[Verse 1]
Wow, need to touch money like a cash cow
Racks make a pocket poke out (Poke out)
Got an Elliot stamp with a rose crown
I'm top floor talkin' from the mountain (Top)
Key lime, put it in the mouth, ow (Mouth)
Now she makin' me aroused (Aroused)
Pretty pussy, I eat it, Mr. Chow, ow (Mr. Chow)
Glock hold thirty whole rounds (Thirty)
They be water, my chains bust down (Bust down)
Just copped my mans a bustdown (Bustdown)
I remember I couldn't afford a pound, now
Money on me, gotta look around (Look around)
These hits got me in and out of town (Hits)
My 'fits, I could drip but never drown (My fits)
Hot shit, need to wipe a nigga down (Hot shit)

[Pre-Chorus]
Last year won a bag, yeah, I got M's in advance (M's in advance)
Tryna cash out like a Cash App, I put cash in her hand (Put cash in her hand)
Talkin' foreign with no visa, put a shark on land (Shark on land)
Pourin' codeine out a freezer, I can feel it like a Xan' (Feel it like a Xan')
I know you want you some bands (Bands)
I'm havin' millions of fans (I'm havin' millions of fans)
Young GunWunna cool as a fan, yeah
Ten on a bitch, get a tan, yeah (Ten on a bitch, get a tan, yeah)
You broke, I can't hear what you sayin' (Sayin')
We spin the whole block, I ain't playin' (Spin the whole block, I ain't playin')
We hunt the boy like a bloodhound
When they showed up, it's a man down (Pew, pew, pew)

[Verse 2]
Ow, came in the game with my own style (Own style)
Top shelf, top floor pent' (Top floor penthouse)
I bought my bitch a Chanel blouse
Off-White slime, good kicks (Slime)
Committed to the game, I said my vows (I said my vows)
One-point-seven what I paid for a house (Uh)
Remember I was sellin' point-sevens out the house (Yeah)
Gunna ain't livin' for the clout (Nah)
Gunna smokin' boost, got the clouds, yeah (Boost, got the cloud)
Heard you got a Louis V pouch (Pouch)
My bracelets at least a hundred thou' (Bracelets at least a hundred thou')
I basically made it out the South (Uh-huh)
A nigga waited patiently, I ain't never pout (Uh-huh)
Now I get to spendin' it and never runnin' out (Nah, nah)
It's a Fendi, and I ain't gotta doubt
