Aww Yea Lyrics[Intro]
R-R-RJae on the track
Aw yeah
Hitta
Aw yeah
Aw
Ayy

[Chorus]
Treat me like a fool, aw yeah
Lot of shit to prove, aw yeah
Bad ass kid after school
In the cut with a tool, yeah
Mama said, "Listen here, boy
I don't want you standing over there"
Few niggas that's from the land
They can't even come around here
In this game, I ain't playin' fair
Everything cost that I wear
Stone cold ice on my bracelet
With a chain like Ric Flair
Beanie Sigel, feel it in the air
Keep a pole, gotta stay aware
Groovy ass dude, aw yeah
Had points to prove, aw yeah
[Verse 1]
People steady thinkin' it's a game
Till they whole life rearranged
Brains on his shirt, he a stain
Thought we had a bond like James
Got me a bitch that I'm focused on
These hoes can't entertain
Look up at the star that I became
Now the world think that I changed
Why I name this "Aww Yea"
And I feel like it shouldn't be no arguin'
I'ma real nigga, aw yeah
Never put much songs on the market
She was irritating, aww yea
Put her ass clean on the blocklist
Luck real good, aww yea
Seven days a week, yea my palm itch (Ahh)
Bitch nigga you a die
And I made sure we situated
Call me El Hitta number 5
In the AM eatin' pancakes with a bowl of grits on the side (Uh)
I'ma live me a long ass time lil' nigga

[Chorus]
Treat me like a fool, aw yeah
Lot of shit to prove, aw yeah
Bad ass kid after school
In the cut with a tool, yeah
Mama said, "Listen here, boy
I don't want you standing over there"
Few niggas that's from the land
They can't even come around here
In this game, I ain't playin' fair
Everything cost that I wear
Stone cold ice on my bracelet
With a chain like Ric Flair
Beanie Sigel, feel it in the air
Keep a pole, gotta stay aware
Groovy ass dude, aw yeah
Had points to prove, aw yeah

You don't know shit about being the one, do you? (Ayy)
But you knowing a lot about bitin' your tongue, do you? (Ayy)
Do you know how to eat without droppin' a crumb, do you? (Ayy)
Why you have to change? I ain't did none to you (Naw, naw)
I was the one that chose this life
I was the one denying advice
I was the one stop praying to Christ
Then after that start lookin' for Christ
I was the one that put up a fight
Posted on Trumbull steady screamin' lights
I was the one not being polite
I was the one, ayy
My society full of gunsmoke
My mom said, "Hitta, son, go"
Was introduced to the jungle
I think I got it from my uncle
I was the one
I was the one being a hard head
Groovy lil' hard head
Ain't got a dad but I'm still a hard leg

[Chorus]
Treat me like a fool, aw yeah
Lot of shit to prove, aw yeah
Bad ass kid after school
In the cut with a tool, yeah
Mama said, "Listen here, boy
I don't want you standing over there"
Few niggas that's from the land
They can't even come around here
In this game, I ain't playin' fair
Everything cost that I wear
Stone cold ice on my bracelet
With a chain like Ric Flair
Beanie Sigel, feel it in the air
Keep a pole, gotta stay aware
Groovy ass dude, aw yeah
Had points to prove, aw yeah
Treat me like a fool, aw yeah
Lot of shit to prove, aw yeah
Bad ass kid after school
In the cut with a tool, yeah
Mama said, "Listen here, boy
I don't want you standing over there"
Few niggas that's from the land
They can't even come around here
In this game, I ain't playin' fair
Everything cost that I wear
Stone cold ice on my bracelet
With a chain like Ric Flair
Beanie Sigel, feel it in the air
Keep a pole, gotta stay aware
Groovy ass dude, aw yeah
Had points to prove, aw yeah
[Outro]
