Next Up - S4-E2, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
(X10)
Yo, ayy, look, ayy

[Verse 1]
I thought about quitting and I came back hard
I told bro, I'ma be in the charts
Never really thought I would come this far
I took so many L's in the way
And it took man a minute to better my craft
I was doing up F with the mandem
Now I'm with Meeks with the head of Atlantic
Shaking hands with the A&R
I Swear I couldn't care about the fame or followers
I need me a million funds
And I really deserve that shit
All that time and work, I did on my ones
Needed a friend couldn't find me none (Huh)
You were calling for help, I couldn't say no, I was getting it done
But you there in the vibe and the party's turnt
I can't dеal with no fake ass love on my crew
No cap, I rathеr be hated
And I'm glad that I never gave up
I stood my ground and patiently waited
If the label ain't talking 7 figures, I'm not persuaded
There was times where I was never rated
And I'm due to be suttin' on the stages
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
I clearly had no one around
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud

[Verse 2]
I shoulda kicked ball like Rashford
But I'm too hard when it comes to the rap
I'm in the booth tryna get me a plaque
'Cah bro's OT still serving crack
We ain't never lived no sweet life
I got my codies back like Zack
I ain't buying no watch or chain
If I ain't giving my mumzy racks
Need me a bae that will keep it real
Stay with the kid, if I caught me a felony
But I said that I'm DTB, pain in my heart
I'm in need of a remedy
You can get cut right off, no cap
If I don't fuck with your energy
He was hating on the low
My own bredrin turned to a enemy
I hated on the fact that I was doing up F
When the rap weren't giving me bread
And them times that I shoulda been studying for my exams
I chose to make money instead
When I was sitting, in times of need
I didn't receive one call or text
She was fucking with me for the clout
That's a reason I hate my ex
You might also like[Chorus]
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
I clearly had no one around
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud
Feel like I'm trapped in this London city
I just pray that I make it out
I been focusing on getting my pound
But this generation only care about clout
When I was flat on my face, In need of a mate
It's funny now man's on top
I just wanna make mumzy proud2Embed
