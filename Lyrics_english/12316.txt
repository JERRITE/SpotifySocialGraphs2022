Say You’ll Haunt Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off-guard and unprepared
I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle, I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to...
[Chorus 1]
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

[Post-Chorus]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever...

[Verse 2]
Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little by little, who you are
I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry and shadows, I can't hide
I just want to be right by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you everything to...

[Chorus 2]
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you
Together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off-guard and unprepared

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to—
I will give you everything to...

[Chorus 2]
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
[Post-Chorus/Outro]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you
Together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you5Embed
