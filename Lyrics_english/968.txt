Lyrics open door ["open door" ft. Noriel & Bad Bunny]

[Enter: Juhn]
I'm going to send you a message after 12 (after 12)
To tell me where you hid the key (the key)
If someone gets up, calm, I hide in the closet (Wuh)
Or below 'e the bed, without making noise, nobody knows

[Chorus: Juhn]
Leave me the open door
That vo'a enter when everyone falls asleep
I want what is in between 'e your leg'
Calla'o, so your boyfriend does not turn on (oh; they tell me Juhn "the All Star", Baby; Wuh)
Leave me the open door
That vo'a enter when everyone falls asleep
I want what is in between 'e your leg'
Calla'o, so your boyfriend does not turn on
[Verse 1: bad bunny]
(Yeh, Yeh)
Your mai always lies at 10 (Yeh), your boyfriend is on foot
Baby, that ass until next year I already booked it
From the first I see that I put you, I played you (Skr ')
I shouted with Cojone.
I don't know if I love you or that I role (or I rob myself!)
In bed, you want 'a war, so the door does not close it'
I know he wants a bug when he sends me a snapchat with the dog filter
I want to get your snapball, leave the buttocks like Apple's apple
Pa 'not turning phillie, smoking' in steam, Yeh (Wuh)

[Chorus: Noriel & Juhn]
Leave me the open door
That vo'a enter when everyone falls asleep
I want what is in between 'e your leg'
Calla'o, so your boyfriend does not turn on (oh; they tell me Juhn "the All Star", Baby)

[Verse 2: juhn]
Stay silent ', don't make noise and get me underneath' e the sheets'
Leave the door open, I know your room
With you I want to take a dust, but long, oh-oh
If your mai gets up, you calm, baby, I know where to hide me
I'm going to put it on, but when lubricate '
And you will cover your mouth when you shout, mommy
Echamo 'one, do', tre ', four
He says I give him better than his cat
That with me comes to jet '
And I without throwing me, always the k
I bought a box 'e conion', Enrolo 'Par of Blune'
For you 'smoke' with me
The ticket I spend with you (ah, ah)
And the cut is for any enemy

Baby, I'm going on the way (Aj√°)
Inside the bulge, I have two Palestinian '(PRR)
Asomate through the window
And check that the neighbor is not looking (attends)
Or I enter the wide door (Wuh!)
If your boyfriend calls you, hooks him (Wuh!)
The most I like is that
Although you win, you ask for 'revenge (rrra, rrra, rrra)
Of your leg ', I have the key (aha)
I know what nobody knows (ah)
Love between you and me does not fit
Your boyfriend is a fool, to 'the world knows (hahaha)
The thing about us is more 'that a secret (ah)
In bed, I don't respect you (ah)
That is why you always come back 'and call me'
And I always come back and I put it (wuh)

[Chorus: Juhn]
Leave me the open door
That vo'a enter when everyone falls asleep
I want what is in between 'e your leg'
Calla'o, so your boyfriend does not turn on
Leave me the open door
That vo'a enter when everyone falls asleep
I want what is in between 'e your leg'
Calla'o, so your boyfriend does not turn on
[Outro: Juhn, Bad Bunny & Noriel]
