Mystery Lady Lyrics[Intro: Masego & Don Toliver]
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You're not even therе, I wanna die, baby (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: Masego]
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I havеn't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicating, it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do, like, anything you want, I'm amazing
Letter to my lady, I just wanna please you, check my catalog
[Verse 1: Masego]
In this life, I've come across fans and hoes
And I like to give my fans a rose
Curse of the talented
Everywhere I go, they wanna change clothes and pose
But my wife be in my dreams, bruh; no, I couldn't see her
I saw her silhouette, I know I can make her wet
But when I wake up alone, 'lone, 'lone
I just break out my phone, phone, phone

[Chorus: Masego]
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I haven't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicating, it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do, like, anything you want, I'm amazing
Letter to my lady, I just wanna please you, check my catalog

[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
Thinking I can make this many songs about
My lady, she be havin' me up, down (Ooh, ooh)
I be in my feelings; sometimes, I be jealous
But I keep it thuggin' like it's Makaveli
Ring, ring, hit my celly (Ring, ring)
Remember you went bad on me, I won't forget it (Ring, ring)
You said you wanna tell on me, now, won't you tell it? (Yeah)
In between the sheets, you know I got you yellin' (Yellin')
You might also like[Chorus: Masego]
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I haven't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicating, it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do, like, anything you want, I'm amazing
Letter to my lady, I just wanna please you, check my catalog

[Bridge: Masego & Don Toliver]
Could it be monogamy ain't meant for me? (No, no, no, nah)
That's way too reckless (Yeah), I'd get too jealous
Could she be from the East or overseas? (Ha)
I learned my lesson, I'm way too Western
Could she be my favorite ethnicity? (Ha)
I'm just undressing all of the sections of my thoughts (Yeah)
Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' too hard
Thinkin' too hard, ha, but I really wanna know

[Chorus: Masego]
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I haven't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicating, it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do, like, anything you want, I'm amazing
Letter to my lady, I just wanna please you, check my catalog
[Outro: Masego & Don Toliver]

You're not even there, I wanna die, baby
