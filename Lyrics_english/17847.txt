Chrome No Heart Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Hurt, what it do?)
Lil' Smoove got a big foot, y'all know how I'm comin' (Uh)
Ah (Uh), ah, let's go (Whaddup Foster?)

[Verse 1]
I cannot see with these VVs on me
My whole body be lit up
Rockin' some shit you ain't see with a baddie
If she in the passenger, that mean I hit her
I can't be playin', these bitches too close
I'ma fuck her one time, then I'ma forget her
I put the chrome, my head and my heart in my pocket
'Cause these bitches be home when I give up (Yeah, yeah)
New G-Wagen, the inside tough
Call these watches, this shit be bust
I hit that nigga bitch while she was cuffed
So my own bitch, I can't trust
Way I spazz on this beat like I'm Mad Max
I cannot speak for the free, where the cash at?
I keep the Blicky for oppers I blast at
I do the hit with the stick in the dash
[Chorus]
I hold my Glock real tight, uh, I do not rock Off-White (Off-White, mm)
I am a thief in the night (Yeah), I got Amiris and Mikes (Mike, mm)
I hold my Glock real tight, uh, I do not rock Off-White (Off-White, mm)
I am a thief in the night (Yeah), and my bitch put the endin' real nice
Yeah, she fine, I'ma put her in Dior and then I'ma marry her (Yeah, she fine)
I'ma put her in Dior and then I'ma marry her (Yeah, she fine)
She need a nigga who raw, a nigga who straight out the four
I might buy her Chanel when I'm bored, let's go (Yeah, she fine)

[Verse 2]
I can't be fuckin' these bitches, they only gon' just eat it up
Barely be flashin' my money, 'cause nowadays
All of these bitches that broke niggas fuck
I see the opp and I say, "Whassup?"
I'm in this club and my shit be tucked
You know I don't play around, first nigga play around
I'm with the shits, get his mouth out, bust him (Bah, yeah, yeah)
Who says she can't take dick because she took it?
I'm the type to go buy me a Lambo', get mad 'cause they lookin' (Yeah)
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause I got me some racks and they calling'
I bet I take no check before I get checked
Fuck 12 and fuck Central Bookings

[Chorus]
I hold my Glock real tight, uh, I do not rock Off-White (Off-White, mm)
I am a thief in the night (Yeah), I got Amiris and Mikes (Mike, mm)
I hold my Glock real tight, uh, I do not rock Off-White (Off-White, mm)
I am a thief in the night (Yeah), and my bitch put the endin' real nice
Yeah, she fine, I'ma put her in Dior and then I'ma marry her (Yeah, she fine)
I'ma put her in Dior and then I'ma marry her (Yeah, she fine)
She need a nigga who raw, a nigga who straight out the four
I might buy her Chanel when I'm bored (Yeah, she fine)

Yeah, she fineEmbed
