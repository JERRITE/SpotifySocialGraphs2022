PERREITO LYRICS [Lyrics for "Perreito"]

[Intro]
The new order
The new musical order
(You know ', ah)

[Verse 1]
Pe-perreito
As in the old time '(oky)
Of those that make you very happy (mmm)
Of those who are to go down slowly
Of those that make you lose all knowledge
Perreito, catchy 'against the couple' (Yeah)
Of those that people ask you another '(another sees')
Of those you like to put the DJ
Of those that we dance all the babies
[Chorus]
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Of those you like to put the DJ
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Of those we dance against the wall

[Verse 2]
I always clean, I always am full (ah)
Always Flow Caro, You Know How I Do (AH)
Always in the dark, never where there is light
Always mommy, never Imami, I'm not like you (haha), oh
I rob my show when low Slow (ah)
I do not ask forgiveness, I know that I have enough flow (ah)
I have the recipe
I walk with NELY, I am his secret weapon (border)
The one that shoots and never fails (oh)
Who does not like to leave, Bitch
Outside, that Mariah arrived (Bitch)
Don't look for me, daddy, if you don't give the size (oh)

[Chorus]
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite (OH)
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite (uy)
Of those who like to put the DJ (OH)
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite (dog)
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite (dog)
Pe-perreito, pe-pe-perite (OH)
