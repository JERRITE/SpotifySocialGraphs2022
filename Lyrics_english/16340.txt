Boogie Nights Lyrics [Text of "Boogie Nights" Ft. Ghali]

[Verse 1: rkomi]
Hey
Days where I am not afraid
Days where either you or nothing
Days where I don't even get up
Days where I don't even speak
Days like the night
Come back as tonight
Free as a lion, yah
Free as liane
Night and day from bed
I don't move from bed
I'm on top of my bed
Even if the rest does
How I get it gets up to me as in progress
With the tables in the return atrium
From the class with my dignified lunch
At the chair was a moment, I remember
The last hello we can't give it chatting
The last kiss knows how much we hate us
The last farewell I was from God, what a liar
The last Siga knows how much we love each other
Let me light without LED, we are shadows to break
I doubt not Plani like swallows, break the wings
The wings, break the wings
[Refrain: Ghali]
Today there is the sun in trendy
The Moon compete with
Before the sky turns off
And there is no drug that holds
I go out for my business
Today I'm not online
I live my happy days
But don't forget the boogie nights

[Verse 2: Ghali]
Day and night
It wasn't night there in Shanghai
Write me: "Goodnight" and then what are you doing?
You leave me in underwear like Walter White
First you love me and then I don't give it to me
Will Research Studies Just suffice?
Have you ever seen a slave to become king
Sleeping on the street and waking up in a King Size Bed?
This big bang happened
I dress and I don't know this brand
And I don't want to be one man show
You are my escape, you are my day off
This money does not ask me how I'm
Let alone if I ate or not

We do it so well
Let's get hurt, we do it so well, hey
We do it so well, hey
We do it so well, uh
Let's get hurt, we do it so well, hey
We do it so well, hey

[Refrain: Ghali]
Today there is the sun in trendy
The Moon compete with
Before the sky turns off
And there is no drug that holds
I go out for my business
Today I'm not online
I live my happy days
But don't forget the boogie nightsembed
