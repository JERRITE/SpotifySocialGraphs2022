Palm Springs (the way you made me feel) LyricsI hate the part of me that still loves you
I still see you in my dreams and everything I do
Wanna call you every single time I've had a few
When I met you, we were...
Sun drunk sippin’ in a pool side bar
We got kissin' in an old golf cart
Told you that I loved you in the first 5 minutes
If love was an ocean we were both jumpin' in it
Couldn’t stop laughing when we both got caught
Smoking marijuana in the bathroom stall
Sleepin' by the fire with your head on my shoulder
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was rеal, I know it was real...
I, miss the way you used to say my namе
I miss Dirty Dancing with you in the desert rain
You looked at me and damn you took my breath away
I still think about the day, we were...
Singing karaoke underneath the stars
Reposado out the bottle tryna find Mars
Girl you had me higher than the satellite dishes
Woke up in the morning we were naked in the kitchen singin'
Sha-la-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la-la
La-ta-di-da, La-ta-di-da
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real, I know it was real...
Even though our love is over now...
Baby you're still all I think about (like all the time)
Even though we're both so far apart (so far, so far)
Baby you know you still got my heart
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real, I know it was real...You might also likeEmbed
