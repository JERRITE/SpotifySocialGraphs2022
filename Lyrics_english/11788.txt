Everything burns let's see erase
From a plume to a town
Houses, children, mothers
Young people, parents and grandparents

We have seen fall
Part of the story
Of this unique world
What is the little we have

We have seen rain
A hundred bullets
About immigrants
And we have seen you
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns

He crossed three borders
San Diego finally arrived
His name is Elizabeth
It is from the Savior

What remained of her
He joined his family
What remained of her
A hug received

What remained of her
A new year celebrated
What remained of her
They pushed a plane

Thanks to a blow
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns
You Might Also Likeha seen presidents
Latin American
Go to Spain to celebrate
The fifth centenary

Day of race
A new anniversary
Or the first genocide
What was in the county

It is impossible to join
Water with oil
The world is a crack
No bridge resists

And there is the egg
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns

We have seen Argentines
Football arrogant
Believe that everyone
It is pending our
Anxiety, paranoia
Stockholm syndrome
Victorean to the jets
That again they take everything

Who stayed
With the money I spent
Pasteing stamps
In my savings notebook?

And where is the thief?
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns

The field needs
To be twisted
Four hundred billion
Of air poisonous red

There are those who poison
What enters through the mouth
There are those who poison
As far as the tongue enters

There are those who poison
Because the state mufa everything
There are those who poison
Voting a bad president

And that was trol
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns

One percent wants to twist
Nine percent have the power
Of what is left in your account only eats
And the rest moves without knowing why

So many years voting
And it almost never turned out
The votes ask us
But never forgive

They tell the traitor
Sitting on a balcony
In an armchair with monkeon
Looking like
Everything burns

Let's go back the page
Red

I expose
The shit people
That always hated poor
Sick and old

Oliente, November
That lasted two thousand and twenty
I lived three hundred years
But I fulfill six nine

I'm on a balcony
Sitting in an armchair
With the tibiez of a heater
Looking like
Everything burns
It's burning
Everything burns
