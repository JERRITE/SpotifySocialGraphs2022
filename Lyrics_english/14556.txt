Not Over Me Yet LyricsI'll never get over you
Even though you broke my heart
I don't know what to do
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
Walking down the streets again, here we go
I'm going shop and I love
And they brings me nothing to me, all they bring was just a one night stand
And we look to a far away land
And I wish you was all in my hands
Just when I though hat you were the one
You left me for another man
I'm always wait right now
Oh its okay, when I have
When Heaven come again
I'll never get over you
Even thou you broke my heart
I don't know what to do
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
You're not over me yet
My mind says let it go
But my heart keep saying no
Heart our song on the radio
I can't stand that stupid song
Cuz I keep on falling apart
Every time I figure you
Yesterday we'll stay apart
There we go, this game came true, yeah
I'm always wait right now
When Heaven come again
I'll never get over you
Even thou you broke my heart
I don't know what to do
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yet
So I guess I'll just pretend that you're not over me yet
You're not over me yet, You're not over me yetYou might also likeEmbed
