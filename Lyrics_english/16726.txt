That Lady, Pts. 1 & 2 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Lovely lady (who's that lady)
Real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 1]
Hear me calling out to you
Cause that's all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say "Look yeah, but don't touch, baby"
Nah, nah, nah don't touch
[Verse 2]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Sexy lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 2]
I would dance upon a string
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring
I would give her anything
If she would just do what I say
Come 'round my way, baby
Shine my way

[Verse 3]
Who's that lady (who's that lady)
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)
Lovely lady (who's that lady)
Real real fine lady (who's that lady)

[Chorus 3]
I would love to take her home
But her heart is made of stone
Gotta keep on keepin' on
If I don't she'll do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeahYou might also like2Embed
