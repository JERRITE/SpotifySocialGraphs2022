Breathing Slowly LyricsWho am I to save you
To try and tame you
And now that you are free of me
But next time when you break down
Is it me you'll take down
With you on your knees?

So who was I to hurt you
To desert you
When you needed me there
So now that you've learned to hate me
You're finally set free
I fall to my knees
And I'm breathing slowly
Like you said to do when you had lost control
My head spins from God's wind
That carries you away from me
Looks like you got away from me
This time
For good...

And since those days have passed me by
I'm in and out of life
The way you used to be
You know I always was the strong one
But now I've come undone
Sweet Release...(come to me)

And I'm breathing slowly
Like you said to do when you had lost control
My head spins from God's wind
That carries you away from me
Looks like you got away from me, This time
You got away from me oh yea
You got away for good...You might also likeEmbed
