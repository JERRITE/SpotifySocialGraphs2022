Yours and mine Lyrics [lyrics by "yours and mine"]

[Intro: Camilo]
They say that behind every man
There is always a great woman
But I disagree
Because you were always ahead
Making our way
And I always remember that

[Verse 1: the two carnals]
You stayed instead of going through the door
When I was on the floor
And with twenty -five on account
And don't think I didn't realize
What did you do what did not realize
[Chorus: Camilo & The two carnals]
I like you
And еs to wake up with you in the mornings
It excites me and motivates me to make him want
Pa 'give yourself everything and nothing is needed
I like you
And a whole life I want to be with you
By your side I want to get old
With you the future looks prettier

[Post-car: Camilo]
Every time I dream dream of the same
How beautiful a child would be of yours and mine

[Interlude: The two carnals]
Ay, ay
And two carnal
And how beautiful Compa sounds, Camilo

[Verse 2: Camilo & the two carnals]
You were still knowing was zero
Only with my illusions and with a lot of dreams (of dreams)
And luckily from your kisses I am the owner (I am the owner)
And how little I have I give it to you

[Chorus: Camilo & The two carnals]
I like you (I like you)
And it is that waking with you in the morning (in the morning)
It excites me and motivates me to make him want
Pa ’give yourself everything and nothing is needed
I like you (I like you)
And a whole life I want to be with you
By your side I want to get old
With you the future looks prettier (much prettier)
