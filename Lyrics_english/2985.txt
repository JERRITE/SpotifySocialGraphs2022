[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I know you heard about me, what you see is what you get
I'm a Memphis nigga, so I gotta keep a .10
She got turned on, panties came off when she got in the Benz
All of my real niggas family, Franklin and Jackson my friends
If I say I'm wit' you, I'm wit' you all the way to the end (For real though)
Big Boo, I miss you, wish I could relive that night again
We in the club, geeked on the lean, you rollin' hard on Ecstasy
The last time I kicked the whip, my dawg in mind, that shit been stressin' me (Damn)
Is that you up there? Keep tellin' God, "Keep blessin' me" (Gotta be you)
M's on M's, but I keep that FN right next to me (Hey, hey)
I come from shit, that's why I ball on them so heavily (For real though)
Stack it, flip it, stack it again, that's my recipe (Uh)
We made the rules, then broke the rules, we do what we want, lil' nigga (Ayy)
These diamonds just keep gettin' bigger (Whew)
Ice cold like the winter (Whew)
Her name, no, I don't remember (Nah)
I see a big bag of money when I look in the mirror (It's Dolph)
[Chorus: Young Dolph & Key Glock]
Baby, what you see is what you get
I'm a street nigga, but I'm rich (Rich, rich, rich, rich)
Nigga, what you see is what you get
We in the Maybach truck, ridin' with them sticks (Sticks, sticks, sticks, sticks)
(Fuck)
Baby, what you see is what you get (Yeah)
I just put a house on my wrist (Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist)
Uh, nigga, what you see is what you get
I done fucked around and hit a lick (Lick, lick, lick, lick)
Ayy, woah (What the fuck?)

[Verse 2: Key Glock]
I know you heard about me, nigga, go ask yo' bitch (Yo' bitch)
Yeah, I got money callin', got these niggas callin' quits
Yeah, I just smashed on what's her name? And scratched her off my list
Uh, and I just bought another Lamb' and parked it on my wrist (Skrrt)
I hopped out sippin' Wock' and Tris, yellow diamonds when I piss
I know you never, ever, ever seen a youngin' flex like this
I'm 'bout my cheddar, mozzarella, never catch me in the mix
I put that metal on whoever, nigga, never go for shit
Yeah, I told you I was six playin' with sticks (Yeah)
At nine with that Aster, to this day, won't go for shit
Yeah, I got money on my mind and on my line, I gotta get it
Yeah, I'm addicted to the money, I'm a junkie, I'm just tryna hit another lick

Baby, what you see is what you get (Baby)
(Bitch)
I'm a street nigga, but I'm rich (Rich, rich, rich, rich)
(Yeah)
Nigga, what you see is what you get
We in the Maybach truck, ridin' with them sticks (Sticks, sticks, sticks, sticks)
(Glock, bitch)
Baby, what you see is what you get
I just put a house on my wrist (Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist)
Uh, nigga, what you see is what you get
I done fucked around and hit a lick (Lick, lick, lick, lick)
