I can't forget you (I Never Wted to Dance) Lyricsfue a summer night when I fell in love with you
You looked me in the eye, and I knew you were for me
When you left, you swore back
Tell me how long do I have to wait

I can't forget you, I can't forget you, love
Tell me that you feel the same, tell me that you feel the same as me
Even if you are far from me, I know we will be together again
Another day and only pi–µnso in you, I can't forget you

That night at the beach we promised to never finish
It has been so much time, but I know that I can trust you
And when we say we swore (we swore to wait)
I just want to see you, kiss you once again
I can't forget you, I can't forget you, love
Tell me that you feel the same, tell me that you feel the same as me
Even if you are far from me, I know we will be together again
Another day and I only think of you, I can't forget you

I can not forget you

And I want you to return next to me
I can not forget you

I can't forget you, I can't forget you, love
Tell me that you feel the same, tell me that you feel the same as me
Even if you are far from me, I know we will be together again
Another day and I only think of you, I can't forget you

I can not forget you
I can not forget you
I can not forget you
