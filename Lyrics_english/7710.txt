One Shot Lyrics [Words of "One Shot" ft. Dry]

[Intro: Maître Gims]
One, one, one, one ...

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One shot of tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me
One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One Shot! Tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me
[Verse 1: master gims]
But drop it, but drop
It's even more worth it, it's even more trouble
The sound has nicked us, the sound nicked us
Basically we did it all to have fun
But people take the lead
Shit stories without any interest
They must understand that in fact
All people stare at you
He cheated on you, she cheated on you
It hurts, I know, but it will fade
Here it is the bled, there is not even an antenna
We fall to the shovel, no one misses the call
And people are ready to do
Dishonest stuff, after getting started
I feel used, monopolized
And all people stare at me

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One Shot! Tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me

[Verse 2: Dry]
Han, for the trophies we did everything
We pulled up will suffocate
Looked for it without touching it
Avoid the prison and its butchers
North, South: this is the crisis
Me, from east to west I wise and my fans cry out
I see that the designer is dust in the writings
No matter how I am inspired, she returns like a Frisbee
I knew the hass, known the dèche
Hand, people said to me: "Labess"
So we arrive without stress, we take all the place
Puts them kilometers by treading
Han, Meugui 'is the master, Dry is the admiral
But who would have thought that we would manimal?
Without headache, in mic 'we make the mesh
That in a time when rhymes attract bullets

One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One Shot! Tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me

[Verse 3: Maître Gims]
Super-Nova fucking
I came, I saw, I innovate
They took me for the Savior
Movement
People are demarcating
Want to know how I get there
Wonder if I go into the white
Wonder if I have that in my blood
My thirst for glory
Made me do things that contradicted my faith
I'm in total darkness
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
Lost in the pump, pump it up
And all people stare at me
[Refrain: Maître Gims]
One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One Shot! Tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me
One Shot! Here it makes the sique-mu just to mess around
One Shot! At home it sets it up for convertibles
One Shot! Tons of sounds, surplus, I no longer know what to give
One Shot! I'm still waiting for the one who will surprise me

[Outro: Maître Gims]
One, one, one, one shot1embed
