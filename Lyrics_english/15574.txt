Let me live Lyrics [Letter of "Let me live (Ft. Juan Gabriel)"]

[Verse 1: Dúrcal Rocío]
I ask you please
In the most attentive way that you leave me alone
I never want to know about you
So leave me and go now

Let me live, because you don't understand me that you and me
No, no, no, we don't have
But nothing to tell us, just goodbye
So leave me and go now
[Pre-Caro: Juan Gabriel]
No no no
I will not resign myself, no
To ever lose even if you punish me
With that contempt that you feel for me

No no no no
I will not resign myself, no
To ever lose even if you supply me
That, love, I no longer insist and I leave you

[Choir: Dúrcal dew]
No, I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I don't have love for you

I have no love or I have anything
For you I have no love, no, no
I have no love or I have anything

[Post-Coro: Juan Gabriel, Rocío Dúrcal]
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
No
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, fairy, nothing, nothing, nothing
No, no
You might also like nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
No, no
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nope

[Verse 2: Rocío Dúrcal]
Let me live, because you don't understand me that you and me
No, no, no, we don't have
But nothing to tell us, just goodbye
So leave me and go now

[Pre-Caro: Juan Gabriel]
No no no
I will not resign myself, no
To ever lose even if you punish
With that contempt that you feel for me

No no no no
I will not resign myself, no
To ever lose even if you supply me
That, love, I no longer insist and I leave you

[Choir: Dúrcal dew]
No, I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I don't have love for you
I have no love or I have anything
For you I have no love, no, no
I have no love or I have anything

[Post-Coro: Juan Gabriel, Rocio Durcal]
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
No
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
No, no

With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
(No, no)
With you nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nope

[Outro: Rocío Dúrcal]
Let me live, because you don't understand me that you and me
No, no, no, we don't have
But nothing to tell us, just goodbye
So leave me and go Yaembed
