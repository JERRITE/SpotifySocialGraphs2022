Castlevania Lyrics [letter from 'Castlevania' ']

[Intro: Goa]
If you let me try, I'm going to steal your soul, ey

[Chorus: Goa & Yung Beef]
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (switch)
I see blood red, you red carmine (pla)
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (ey, wow)
I am so dead and you so crazy about me
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (Yeah)
I see blood red, you red carmine (carmín red; yeah)
I have been thinking that you are not for me (that you are not for me)
I am so dead and you so crazy about me (huh)
[Verse 1: goa]
It's me your vampire, I want a castle (wow, wow), yeah
I have to smell a lot of shine
When I am with you, nail the fangs
Yeah, and you and I do blood together
Again, you and I are going to live forever
I don't need a coffin, I have a drug in my pocket
I treat you badly, but with love
I don't need a coffin, I have a drug in my pocket
I treat you badly, but with love
We look at something fast before the sun rises
You and I together call the attention too much

[Chorus: goa]
I have been thinking that you are not for me
I see blood red, you red carmine
I have been thinking that you are not for me
I am so dead and you so crazy about me
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (Yeah)
I see blood red, you red carmine
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (pa' me)
I am so dead and you so crazy about me

[Verse 2: Yung Beef]
Carmín Red, Carmine Red
I have been thinking that you are not for me
Maybe I'm too much street, too much
But I liked your blood when I drank it
I don't care if you don't understand it, Baby, I know it's like that (Facts)
Goa, Yung Beef, UH
DP Beats (Switch)
I have had to kill others to live (pa-pa-pa-pa-paw)
Your whore bite his neck, when beat sounds
I am a vampire, for the day I like to sleep
That shit that they propose, too much childish
PUTA I gave you, huh
I vo'a suck your blood, you go 'suck' dick

I see blood red, you red carmine (carmín red)
I have been thinking that you are not for me
I am so dead and you so crazy for me (you so crazy for me)
I have been thinking that you are not pa 'me (Yeah)
I see blood red, you red carmine (carmín red)
I have been thinking that you are not for me (that you are not for me)
I am so dead and you so crazy for me (you so crazy for me) 2embed
