I have cried (like a child) Lyricshoy I have realized that I have lost my time
Thinking about getting more than I already have
Without valuing what life already gave me by your side
And now that I have so far I recognize the days

I have cried, like a child
That does not see sunlight when it is summer
And they have removed him, from his hands
His best smile the most precious time
And I haven't tired of dreaming of you by my side
To think that today you have forgotten me
I love you, I love you, I love you
And although I turned around the world I don't know a border
That the hearts break two, there is no homeland or flag
Prettier than the breeze that is drawn on your face
I am pirate sailing in the seas of your gaze
I don't want to stop thinking about you
I can't stop dreaming of you
Tell what I do if you are not here
I need you like the air I breathe

I have cried, like a child
That does not see sunlight when it is summer
And they have removed him, from his hands
His best smile the most precious time
And I haven't tired of dreaming of you by my side
To think that today you have forgotten me
I love you, I love you, I love you

Without value, it is of no use to have you close or far
I don't complain, I just want to get old, by your side

I have cried, like a child
That does not see sunlight when it is summer
And they have removed him, from his hands
His best smile the most precious time
I haven't tired of dreaming of you by my side
To think that today you have forgotten me
I love you, I love you, I amyouu might also likembed
