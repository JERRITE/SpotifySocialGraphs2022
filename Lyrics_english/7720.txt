What I Put You Through Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw you told the world
You're a single girl
I won't lie that broke my heart
Thought we were the same
But now I can't explain
How we got so far apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Poison words from all your friends
I deserve the things they've said
Still ain't worse than what I'm saying in my own head
[Chorus]
So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through

[Verse 2]
Every single day
I asked you to stay
When I should've let you go
Couldn't settled down
But needed you around
Different worlds, I wanted both

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know that it weren't fair
You can shame my every step
Still ain't worse than what I'm saying in my own head

[Chorus]
So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through
What I put you through
Put you through

I know you won't forgive me
And you probably don't believe me
But this isn't easy, no, this isn't easy
I swear it's like I'm breathing
Like a part of me is leaving
And I can't forgive me, I hope you believe me

[Chorus]
So tell me I'm a waste of love
Tell me that I'm not enough
Say you hope I see the truth
That I won't find no one like you
Tell me you don't care no more
When you know I can't let go
Beat my heart all black and blue
'Cause it ain't half as bad as what I put you through
What I put you through
Oh-woah, woah I put you through, yeah
What I put you through1Embed
