Lioba Lyricsmirame Night ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
That is a wolf night ...
Look at me ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
That is a wolf night ...
Nice to meet you, what's your name? Lark
You are very satita but as you amaze
They say that you want even with your shadow
Don't be afraid of me, let's go to the carpet
You will see how shouting, mommy, you name me
Deliver your body and the tip Cobra
You get the difficult one, you are a fox
I am the bambino, mommy, there are no leftovers here

Look at me ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
That is a wolf night ...
Look at me ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
That is a wolf night ...

Maybe the night was not the most indicated
Maybe the fog made me a bad play
Just try with you
What did you expect?
You with your gaze, and I full of desire
Maybe the night was not the most indicated
Maybe the fog made me a bad play
Just try with you
What did you expect?
You with your gaze, and I full of desire
Go ahead, that the next beast passes
The one that is desperate on the disc
Come seduce me, the night is passenger
Come we put me wolf, my bed awaits you
I see you touching you, my hands miss you
You want to wrap me, wolf, with your Ma√±a
And your movements my eyes tarnish
When I make you mile with my feat

Look at me ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
That is a wolf night ...
Look at me ... I tell you here in the sand ...
Talk to me ... under the full moon ...
Love me ... tonight serene ...
And don't look at the time ...
What is a wolf night ... embed
