25WAGG3DOU2 Lyrics[Intro]
(おはよう)
(Phew, I'm too swagged out on a regular basis)
Hey, ha, phew (Hey), woo, uh

[Chorus]
She seein' the stars, she feel like she made it (Yeah)
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too starred out, it feels amazing
[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna lie, I set it in stone
I was rockin' the Chrome, I had Razor Ramon
I didn't fit the Tom Ford, had to tape a lil' more
I ain't even puttin' the Rick in the score
I can't— (Whoo)
I can't explain, let me say a lil' more
Make some money, she might be yours
Legs went up like the Lambo' doors
Legs controllin' a brand new Porche
Tell me, tell me more
Can't even shop 'cause I fucked up the stores
This much swag is against the law
Picked up an addiction to rockin' Dior
Sell me, sell me more

[Chorus]
She seein' the stars, she feel like she made it (Yeah)
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too starred down, it feels amazing
She seein' the stars, she feel like she made it (Yeah)
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too starred down, it feels amazing

Ha, ha, Genevieve, Vienna
Spend the evening with a singer, she wanna be Rihanna
360 degrees when she takin' the picture, she wanna be a model
I'm fresh everyday like it's New Year's Eve and I might not see tomorrow
Rockin' McQueen
Rockin' McQueen
Livin' so evil
Gotta keep burnin' my eyes 'cause I gotta watch for the schemers
She gotta keep love 'bout her eyes if she wanna look at a demon, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She seein' the stars, she feel like she made it (Yeah)
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too starred down, it feels amazing
She seein' the stars, she feel like she made it (Yeah)
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too swagged out, on a regular basis
Too starred down, it feels amazing4Embed
