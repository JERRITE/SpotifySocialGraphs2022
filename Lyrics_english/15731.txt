Do not depart from my lyrics [letter of "do not depart from me" ft. Valeria Bertuccelli]

[Verse 1: Vicentico]
I thought I could run out of you and I can't
My love is difficult, more difficult than I thought
I have left my door ajar
And you entered without warning
Do not go away from me
Oh no

[Verse 2: Valeria Bertuccelli, both]
I thought that with such experience, you knew everything
And with you I learned that love doesn't care who knows more
And that time in us does not exist
For everything I see in you
Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no
[Chorus: Both, Vicentico]
All love I expected from life
I've found only in you
And it turns out that you are not here
Those air of who knows nothing
I have been happy
Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 3: Vicentico, both]
I didn't think that innocent air
I showed me a world
In beautiful things, so simple
That you always tell me
Because of the fault you make me here
And for everything I see in you
Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus: both]
All love I expected from life
I've found only in you
And it turns out that you are not here
Those air of who knows nothing
I have been happy
Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no

Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no
Do not go away from me
Oh no, oh no
Do not go away from me
Oh no
Oh Noembed
