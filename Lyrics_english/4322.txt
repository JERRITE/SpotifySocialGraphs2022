Oh
Over it passed why it gets harder
The great -grandfather Pope distributing strong
With my letters fogoneo
What a time swallowed me metadona
Now I spit but in Liriqueo
That you think I will take away (answer)
That you believe that I vo'a to crack (answer)
That you believe that I do not vo'a to ride
Well, hold this basuca that I'm going to wait for her, ha

I don't have a money
What I have, I have it and now
That yes, a well accepted letter '
Sacapuntas, anyone smears
No complexes with the most virao's teeth than ever
Raperos flee when I grab the notebook
Guillaos de Fifty and do not reach Peceta
Snoring that if I ask that flute
But every time I get out of the tone

Every time I get closer
This is to see that not everything you sell is sex
Every time I get closer
I continue in mine and taking care of the hounds

Every time I get closer
This is to see that not everything you sell is sex
Every time I get closer
I continue in mine and taking care of the hounds
You Might Also Likehabla Language Calva (JA, JA)
And the right you have
I have it to say what comes out
More business than feeling
And I tell the truth until when I lie
I'm sure I don't worry about my future
Much is left for my hard drive
Base and Foundation Compenso
Throwing me and taking care of the wishes

That you are an old guard that is a myth
If when I still started you played with baqueritos
And do not deny it that he agitated me
Accept that I put the foundation in your coquito
Come when you come with what you come
If you are guillas, they can philo you as a rebaja
Each corrupt comes his montana, corduroy
Don't make gray hair

(x2)
Every time I get closer
(This is to see that not everything you sell is sex)
Every time I get closer
(I continue in mine and taking care of the hounds)

Every time I get closer
This is to see that not everything you sell is sex
Every time I get closer
I continue in mine and taking care of the hounds
If there was a time that I did not have the butter
Much less, I have the envy or feka
Now with the e-d-d I make the duplete
The duo that has it more weighs 'so' respects
Giving pela, Acapella
With the sludge of the street well hit in my sole
Since the time of Pinpinela
Giving tutoring to my own school

Pa 'work with me get it cashimiro
I don't fry to 'and then shoot them
Vamo'a forgetting the colored fish
My daughters do not feed with favors
Mine walks, I put him like a mazda
While many only look for propagandas
None can with my Saranana
Corduroy, pulling the house out the window

Every time I get closer
(This is to see that not everything you sell is sex)
Every time I get closer
(I continue in mine and taking care of the hounds)

Every time I get closer
This is to see that not everything you sell is sex
Every time I get closer
I continue on mine and taking care of the smelling
