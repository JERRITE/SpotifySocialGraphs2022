TranslationEnglishkrippy Kush Lyrics [lyrics by "Krippy Kush" ft. Bad Bunny & Rvssian]

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
(The RVSSIAN)
The 'Maleantes want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'Maleantes want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the whores want kush (hahaha) (Yeh Yeh Yeh)
[Verse 1: bad bunny]
Here we spend bulls through the TSA
Whores are easy as in GTA
200 boxes' e Paper I asked on eBay
In PR is already legal, I signed the law
Smoking like snoot dogg and wiz kha
The cats want Kush, they don't want Friska
I turned on a cane like the Brisca
2 phillies, stay bizca
What you are doing I did first
Baby, that boyfriend of yours is half a culero
I walk for New York with a couple of leather
And battery and 'fourth pa' to's these bastards make them fierce
I have farmers like Piculín
Red eyes like Chapulín
Today I forget to drink the ritalin
But the 602 came down with Lean

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
But now I'm Pa'l Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
We also have Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'Maleantes want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the whores want kush

(Skrt, Farru!)
I turn on and get lost in smoke
Floto every time I smoke
Capsulendo I go on the ship, ship
Do not run for anyone's, nobody
I don't trust anyone, nobody
Because it is not known here, knows
Who is who (Wuh!)

[Verse 2: Farruko & Bad Bunny]
The pounds I buy them and arrive in Fedex
Priority the package, Next Day via Express
Of the cell phone with the GPS
And the shipping is charged to the fool of your ex
Who has a bichote guille and what smokes is regular
Synthetic of those who sell there in legal positions
That goes down to the movie, that here does not come to border
That we are millionaires, and I just buy a couple of acres to sow
Baby to's these bastards want to kill me
Life is one and I have to take advantage of
I don't know if this is a dream or it will be real
Before leaving for another world I want to try you
That when I die, I don't know where I am going
If you say heaven or hell, or I am there, I'm still
Pa'l fuck tomorrow, I only think of today
I don't vo'a to change, so I'm, yeah
[Choir: Farruko, Bad Bunny]
But now I'm Pal 'Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
We also have Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
We also have Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush, Kush
The 'Maleantes want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the babys want kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
The 'gangsters want Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy, Krippy
To'as the whores want kush
