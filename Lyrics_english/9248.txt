Chillin Lyrics [Enter]
Ayy, give it palla ma niggaaaah
I am the jincho?
Yeyo Sossa, Ganja -inc, Curacao, Spain
Strong people, Money Vision
Aaayyy, this life we ​​live
Palla ma niggaahh

[Chorus]
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu
We Pull Up in the Mercedez, I don't care any
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu
If there is room, you arrive the babies
Niggah thats the life we ​​know
I wake up Chillin (I get up and I make a unu)
We Pull Up in the Mercedez (? For the barium?)
I get up Chillin (to distribute? On the street)
If there is room, you arrive the babies (oh that I didn't believe anyone)
Niggah thats the life we ​​know
[See - El Jincho]
Aaiiyyhh ...
This is the life that I live, 24/7? been
Do not trust love give a woman, even friends
When you have money, everyone is with you
But do you run you? If you don't have cash
? What I tell you, here there are envious batteries
That would come to their mothers for a couple of them
It is not easy to progress in a barium with little resource
That's why I feel so Orguyoso
It's not for being famous, that's honey
Today they love you this paste
But Mayana, they don't remember
Therefore, everything says about me it is worth a cock
I am in Curacao, ate in Soto smoking Yerba
SELL
They try to invent, speaking account shit
For a Lenjo, the ass puts it in purchase
And in Penjo, they give it as if they were not the owners
That does not go with the Orcasitenjo
I was taught to be a peany senyor
Capture the Mensahe, better that you leave the visa
Woman this is for you pages
Every time the menstruation lowers you

[Chorus]
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu
We Pull Up in the Mercedez, I don't care any
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu
If there is room, you arrive the babies
Niggah thats the life we ​​know

[Chorus]
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu
We Pull Up in the Mercedez, I don't care any
I wake up Chillin, the rollo I pray unu

If there is room, you arrive the babies (oh that I didn't believe anyone)
Niggah thats the life we ​​know
Niggah thats the life we ​​know
