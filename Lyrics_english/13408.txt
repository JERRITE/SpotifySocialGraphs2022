Point 40 lyrics ["point 40" letter]

[Intro: Interview with Don Omar]
- My first criminal offensive case was because there was a song that said that I "have a point 40" and it was my friend
Baby Rasta and I didn't know Baby Rasta for that time
- UH-HMM
- But it was my favorite song
- What did he say?

[Chorus: Baby Rasta & Jon Z]
(I have a point 40)
I have a point 40 (blam-blam)
MY CORILLO (YI)
To's have point 40 (blam-blam-blam)
AK and Kilos (Blam-Blam)
Ak and point 40 (blam-blam)
THE MACHINE (Blam)
I have a point 40
[Verse 1: jon z]
I have a forty (clam)
I have a forty (clam, yi yi)
Strong as The Rock
Strong as The Rock (Yi Yi)
I'm the new 2pac
I am the new 2pac (Yi Yi)
Baby Z Jon Rasta Kobe - Shaq (Yeh, Yeh)
I feel Baby Rasta in the 90s
When he arrived at the album with more than 70
To's we have glock, the hermitage is heated
You are Rocky and I am Cotto with 9 and Mi 40
Here is generation, this is not playstation
I will zumbo to ceiling
Face, face and chest
Here is generation, that this is not playstation
I will zumbo to ceiling
The face and chest
The 100 plates, I am already made
100 combs, pa 'you go rights (Ch√°)

[Chorus: Baby Rasta & Jon Z]
(I have a point 40)
I have a point 40 (blam-blam)
My Corillo
To's have point 40 (blam-blam-blam)
AK and Kilos (Blam-Blam)
Ak and point 40 (blam-blam; ah!)
THE MACHINE (Baby Rasta)
I have a point 40

The 40 glock, the legendary always at the waist (UH)
In case you get a madman fly the teeth (Auuuuh!; SUP!)
40 platinos as armor (raa)
40 are bullets and 40 burns
I have my shelter, I never download
Jon Z & Baby Rasta, Kakaroto with Bardock
Humble and real wolf
(Auuuh!) The forty shout when I charge
Point 40, point 40 (suu!)
Whores 40, accounts increase
Combo e '40, to's they are 40
Punch I have a point 40 (Raa!)

[Outro: Don Omar, Baby Rasta]
"Day and night," he became our "Breta and Butter," as they say in English. What was William's first case? Possession of a firearm, a Smith & Wesson gun point 40. Willmer is not to blame for that, I am not to blame for having been the reporter of the neighborhood and that the message has been taken in a way
I have a 40embed point
