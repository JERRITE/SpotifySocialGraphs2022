Ohio (Come Back to Texas) Lyrics[Verse 1]
She said she needed a break
A little time to think
But then she went to Cleveland
With some guy named Leland
That she met at the bank
There's nothing wrong with Ohio
Except the snow and the rain
I really like Drew Carey
And I'd love to see
The Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame
[Pre-Chorus]
So when you're done
Doing whatever
And when you're through
Doing whoever
You know Denton County
Will be right here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway

[Verse 2]
I think I made a mistake
It's not that easy to take
She went to make a deposit
Then she cleaned out her closet
Guess I'll sit here and wait
For her to come back home
(I wish she'd come back home)
It shouldn't take very long
(So long, so long)
I bet she misses the sunrise
And Mrs. Baird's fruit pies
(But I could be wrong)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So when you're done
Doing whatever
And when you're through
Doing whoever
You know Denton County
Will be right here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
I bet you missed your exit
And drove right on through the Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway

[Bridge]
Troy Aikman wants you back
Willie Nelson wants you back
NASA wants you back
And the Bush twins want you back
Pantera wants you back
And Blue Bell wants you back
I got a premonition
I'm taking a petition
And the whole state's gonna sign
[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway

[Outro]
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway, yeah1Embed
