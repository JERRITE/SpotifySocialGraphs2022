On a Mountain (Flume Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Georgia Twinn]
We can lay here on a mountain, me and you
Can you feel it? This is something new
I can see your heart's been broken too
So just lay here on a mountain, me and you

[Drop: Georgia Twinn]
We can lay here on a mountain, me and you
Can you feel it? This is something new
I can see your heart's been broken too
So just lay here on a mountain, me and you
[Bridge: Georgia Twinn]
We, we can lay here
We, we can lay here, new
We, we can lay here
We, we can lay here, new

[Build: Georgia Twinn]
We can lay herе on a mountain, me and you
Can you feel it? This is something new
I can see your hеart's been broken too
So just lay here on a mountain, me and you

Me and you
We can lay here on a mountain, me and you
Can you feel it? This is something new
I can see your heart's been broken too
