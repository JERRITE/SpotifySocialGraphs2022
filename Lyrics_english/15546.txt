MORENA LYRICS SKIN [LETTER OF "MORENA SKIN"]

[Verse 1]
It is the magic of your body
Or your breath perfume
It is the fire of your bonfire
That has me prisoner
The sweet poison of your charm
Or it's the flame that is burning
It is the honey of your tenderness
The reason for my madness
I'm nothing!
Without the light of your gaze
Without the echo of your laughter
That sneaks into my window
You own heat
About my pillow
Of my nostalgia nights
Of my dreams and hopes
[Chorus]
You are brown skin
Passion and sand song
You are brown skin
Night under the stars
You are brown skin
Playa, Sol and Palmeras
You are brown skin
My spring dream

[Post-chorus]
They are your kisses
Sweet fruit that gets drunk
That my sadness takes
And finally returns calm
Prisoner of your love in the dawn
Of your kisses, your caresses
Who stay in the soul

[Chorus]
You are brown skin
Passion and sand song
You are brown skin
Night under the stars
You are brown skin
Playa, Sol and Palmeras
You are brown skin
My spring dream
You Might Also Like [Post-Chorus]
They are your kisses
Sweet fruit that gets drunk
That my sadness takes
And finally returns calm
Prisoner of your love in the dawn
Of your kisses, your caresses
Who stay in the soul

[Bridge]
Brown skin you are cumbia, sun and sand
Brown skin, my delirium and my condemnation

It is the magic of your body
Or your breath perfume
It is the fire of your bonfire
That has me prisoner
Oh no!

Brown skin you are cumbia, sun and sand
Brown skin, my delirium and my condemnation

You are soft like the wind
You are sweet thought
You are sun of my trigales
You are honey from my cane
[Post-chorus]
They are your kisses
Sweet fruit that gets drunk
That my sadness takes
And finally returns calm
Prisoner of your love in the dawn
Of your kisses, your caresses
Who stay in the soul

[Outro]
You are brown skin
Passion and sand song
You are brown skin
Night under the stars
You are brown skin
Playa, Sol and Palmeras
You are brown skin
My spring dream
You are brown skin
Because only by your side I am happy
You are brown skin
I have so many things for you
You are brown skin
Confusing me in your bonfire slowly
You are brown skin
You have me prisoner! Embed
