I offer her Lyrics de la Moria, I'm still thinking here
In the woman who has stolen my heart
And I don't understand how the hell you have stayed
In my mind and in my soul and I don't get you heart

If you loved me, why have you failed me?
You were bad but you didn't care
You let yourself go for a wallet
You fall in love with anyone, you will pay for your mistake

And I offer her with a bottle
And you can't imagine how your heart hurts
And I offer her, because I know she is the owner
Of everything I feel and sing you in this song
Three in the morning, I'm still revealed
Your perfume stayed in my room
I hope when you return it is not late
How could I fall in love and today you leave without goodbye

And I offer her with a bottle
And you can't imagine how your heart hurts
And I offer her, because I know she is the owner
Of everything I feel and sing you in this song

And I offer her with a bottle
And you can't imagine how your heart hurts
And I offer her, because I know she is the owner
Of everything I feel and sing you in this song

Le Leiee
I offer her ... there is ombe!
Le Leiee
I offer her ... there is ombe!
Le Leiee
That sorrows are going to be erased
Le Leiee

And I offer her with a bottle
And you can't imagine how your heart hurts
And I offer her, because I know she is the owner
Of everything I feel and sing you in this song
You Might Also Likey I offer her with a bottle
And you can't imagine how your heart hurts
And I offer her, because I know she is the owner
Of everything I feel and sing you in this song

Six in the morning, I'm still thinking
In the woman who has stolen my heart
