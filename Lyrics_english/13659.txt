The Evil Folk LyricsIn the dead of night
Do your demons come alive?

In a phantom's light
Do your bring the dark to life?

Reach out to heaven
While you dance with the devil

In the fires of tomorrow
It's the evils folk
In the dead of night
Do your demons come alive?

In a phantom's light
Do your bring the dark to life?

Reach out to heaven
While you dance with the devil

In the fires of tomorrow
It's the evils folk

In the fires of tomorrow
In the fires of tomorrow

In the fires of tomorrow
It's the evils folk
