Lyrics connection [verse 1: koning]
I get up from bed and I see my sun
I can touch it and smell it here in my sheet
Vision never overshadows, always hypnotizes your way of looking
Smiling to the sound of Sunshine: "Your soul is mine," I hear she talk
And she says I complain about the boring
But her boring is what delights me the most
The peace that only she brings me
Make me release all the good phrases in my throat
When I switch my hand through your body
That's when Djavan makes sense again
And fuck if the world gets into war
I will always be your shelter
I protect her from all danger
As a project our future
Now holds me strong and trust: Koning will be your safe haven
And all the moments that I was not on your side
At the best time will be rewarded, it is a fact
I see the story happening today
"This is My Last Year Being Broke"
[Chorus: Torres]
Your body in my body
And we loving ourselves as if there is no tomorrow
I travel in your breeze and you make me crazy, my love
For me it's never too much
And you know I was always your fan
Whenever I have you for me it is still little and I will
Give you sincere love as if there is no tomorrow
I travel in your breeze and you make me crazy, my love
For me it's never too much
And you know I was always your fan
Whenever I have you for me it is still little and I will

[Verse 2: towers]
Good things are perceived with looks
I was sure after I met you
And it seemed that I had already seen you elsewhere
But the fuck is the certainty I didn't see
And managed to make me approach
And a thousand things I never did
I took you to know my favorite places
And it seemed that it was the first time I was there
And she knows how she does, she delights
Looks like I fall into the best dance
And we always fight the same child
But the night ends the drama and we fuck
And she has been bringing the peace I always asked for
Make me feel, as I never felt
I know it's special and thanks for it's here
It was hard to surrender, but I got
You might also like [Chorus: Torres]
Your body in my body
And we loving ourselves as if there is no tomorrow
I travel in your breeze and you make me crazy, my love
For me it's never too much
And you know I was always your fan
Whenever I have you for me it is still little and I will
Give you sincere love as if there is no tomorrow
I travel in your breeze and you make me crazy, my love
For me it's never too much
And you know I was always your fan
Whenever I have you for me is still little and I will1embed
