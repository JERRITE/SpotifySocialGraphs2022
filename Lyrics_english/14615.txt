I've been to counties and cities i can pronounce
I went back to all countries and to cities and I can't boast about it
And the Places on the Globe I Didn's Know Existing
And in the parts all over the world I don't know if they still exist

IN ROMANIA THIS HAVE ACCESS TO EXTRAIN
"Pit, you can have me and my sister."
Pit, you can make me international and my sister (international)
