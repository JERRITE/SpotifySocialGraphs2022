How a Man Dies Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Well I called you up to say I thought about you
These aren’t the usual times
Have you been doing alright?
It was just like us to pick up where we left off
Don’t read between the lines
Just laugh and let it slide
You’re

[Chorus:]
Not supposed to cry always keep it bottled up inside
When it hurts go hide don’t show what you shouldn’t feel inside
That’s how a, that’s how a man dies
Leave your soft side at the door it’s easier to fight
Fake a smile when you’re half alive
Pour a drink and you go for one last drive
That’s how a, that’s how a man dies
[Post Chorus:]
Die, die, die, die, die, dies
That’s how a man dies
Die, die, die, die, die, dies

[Verse 2:]
Between the two of us are you really doing fine?
Cause to me it looks like you’re starting to show signs
When the luck runs out and you come undone
And you can’t tell which way’s up and you get stuck thinking
That the old way is the right way
Like

[Chorus:]
Not supposed to cry, always keep it bottled up inside
When it hurts go hide, don’t show what you shouldn’t feel inside
That’s how a, that’s how a man dies
Leave your soft side at the door it’s easier to fight
Fake a smile when you’re half alive
Pour a drink and you go for one last drive
That’s how a, that’s how a man dies

[Post Chorus:]
Die, die, die, die, die, dies
That’s how a Man dies
Die, die, die, die, die, dies

When you’re staring down the face of a barrel
Wondering if anybody’s missing you (missing you)
When you’re deep in the bottom of a bottle
How can I be the one to get to you
When you think you’re

[Chorus:]
Not supposed to cry, always keep it bottled up inside
When it hurts go hide, don’t show what you shouldn’t feel inside
That’s how a, that’s how a man dies
Leave your soft side at the door it’s easier to fight
Fake a smile when you’re half alive
Pour a drink and you go for one last drive
That’s how a, that’s how a man diesEmbed
