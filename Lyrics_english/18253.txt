[Pre-stribe: Paulo Londra & Lenny Tavarez]
Ey, baby, no, OH-OH-OH (OH-OH-OH)
You don't see what I'm dying
Because a little while I give me 'your attention, oh-oh-oh (-cion, -cion)
I'm lost in that blue of your eyes, Yeh
Ey, baby, no, no-oh-oh (no-oh-oh)
You don't see that I'm dying
Because a little while you regal your attention, oh-oh-oh-oh
I am lost in the blue of your eyes, Yeh
[Chorus: Paulo Londra & Lenny Tavarez]
Bab
I don't even know you but play with you
Bab
I don't even know but play with you (mmm-mmm)

[Verse 1: Paulo Londra]
Cold look like snow, freezes me until I don't give more '
If it touches me it makes me elevate, even see toa 'the city
I would buy what she wants as long as she comes here
Being as it should, relax 'without a problem
Sure has a thousand suitors, but not a brave
To make tenderness without fear of what people say
I know well what he feels, I know very well what he feels
That we are equal 'with the same' errors of always

[Pre-Stribill: Paulo Londra, Lenny Tavarez & both]
Ey, baby, no, oh-oh-oh (no, oh-oh)
You don't see what I'm dying
Because a little while I give me 'your attention (-ccion, -Cocion)
OH-OH-OH-OH (UH-OH-OH-OH)
I am lost in the blue of your eyes, Yeh (Wuh!)

[Chorus: Paulo Londra & Lenny Tavarez]
NENA Curse, Ey, Nena Curse, Me '(Ja-Ja!)
I don't even know her but play with you
Bab
I don't even know you but play with you

Use me, use me, use me
Make me, give him, Kiss me
As in the vamo school 'to learn
Burning vemo 'El Dawn
You-tú-tú-tú-tú (and salt ')
With the 'eye' tile '(-zu', -zule ')
I with the 'Red' Eye (Ro-Rojo ')
Your mouth dries and with my tongue I soak it (SH-sh-sh)
I want to be Messi and you my antonella
Prepare to live a novel
I am exclusive, not anyone else
That's why I want you to be 'my baby
Forever my baby; me'

[Pre-stribe: Paulo Londra & Lenny Tavarez]
Ey, baby, no, oh-oh-oh
You don't see what I'm dying
Because a little while I give me 'your attention, oh-oh-oh (-cion, -cion)
I'm lost in that blue of your eyes, Yeh
Ey, baby, no, no-oh-oh (no-oh-oh)
You don't see that I'm dying
Because a little while I regal your attention, oh-oh-oh-oh (-ció '; uh-oh-oh-oh)
I am lost in the blue of your eyes, Yeh
