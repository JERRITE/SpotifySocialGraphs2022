Feels So Right Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Oh yeah
Oh miss lady
These sexual thoughts keeps rushing through my mind
All I wanna do is touch you (touch you, touch you)
Because the feelings that I feel so hard to fight
But I ain’t trying to rush you (rush you, rush you)
Even though I’m only in your town for one night
I got enough time to rush through the drill
Girl tell me how you feel deep down inside
Yeah
Cause I’m trying to make you feel
[Hook:]
Make you feel so right
Whenever your body’s lying next to mine
It’s gonna get loose
Let’s take it through the roof
Cause you know that you’re the truth
Girl you’re extra fine
Cause I’m trying to make you feel
Make you feel so right
Whenever your body’s lying next to mine
It’s gonna get loose
Let’s take it through the roof
