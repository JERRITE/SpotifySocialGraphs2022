[Verse 1: Lorduy, Dim & Lordu, Dim]
I no longer endure so much drink
I have thought about killing what I have forgotten
My friend 'they threw it to me (Wuh!)
As I continue like this, I'm going to fuck
I already forgot what the relaxation is
I haven't played FIFA for a while (Wuah!)
Half bottles I didn't have
I take a drink and another drink
I get to say Dalmato and Ñejo
And sometimes I listen to the old man's advice
The truth and that you left libo '
I stayed with the face of asshole
I have a storage pod 'in the chest (Wuh!)
Will it be spite?
Like Huevón looking for pa'l roof
What is done is done
[Chorus: Dim & Christian Nodal]
Please tell me
That is taken for sorrows
When you are freshly injured
And alcohol does not help
To forget her
To forget her
I already danced with other lips
And I always remember her
I have sung thousand rancheras
And alcohol does not help
To forget her
To forget her (ajajajay; ba-bu-eh)

[Verse 2: Christian Nodal & Dim]
May you rest here
You left and I left
My body walks alone
My soul left 'you
It is not your fault
That I do not get used to being without you
(I don't get used to being without you)
But if I'm going to forget you
I swear whoever wants
It's just a matter of time
Until a more good one arrives than you (than you)
Do you do better than you, uh (do it better than you)

Please tell me
That is taken for sorrows
When you are freshly injured
And alcohol does not help
To forget her (Nou, Nou, Nou, Nou, no)
To forget her (ajay)
I already danced with other lips
And I always remember her
I have sung thousand rancheras
And alcohol does not help
To forget her (Yeh)
To forget her (Ba-bu-eh)

[Bridge: Pablito]
I already went down Tinder on my cell phone
And I uploaded a picture pa 'that gives it match
One that is good and helps me forget it
I don't plan to get it out of my bed
Until I think I will get drunk
I want to give hard tequila
I want to drown them to my sorrows
But the bastons already know how to swim (Yeh)
I already went down Tinder on my cell phone
And I uploaded a picture pa 'that gives it match
One that is good and helps me forget it
I don't plan to get it out of my bed
Until I think I will get drunk
I want to give hard tequila
I want to drown them to my sorrows
But the bastons already know how to swim (Yeh)
[Chorus: Dim & Christian Nodal]
Please tell me (someone tells me)
That is taken for sorrows
When you are freshly injured (when you are injured)
And alcohol does not help
To forget her (for forgetting her)
To forget her (for forgetting her)
I already danced with other lips
And I always remember her
I have sung thousand rancheras
And alcohol does not help
To forget her (for forgetting her)
To forget her (for forgetting her)
