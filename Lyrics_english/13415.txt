Stay near me, come, go tonight
And even a lie, love me tonight

In quantity the bottles arrive
The vip shines more 'what a star
I like еsta but also that
I swear that tonight I mischief about her
And now I'm a poor devil
I don't have your love, but ass 'I have diverse'
Drug 'and alcohol is necessary
Only solitary game
Your name erase from my newspaper
You don't ere 'her, but Bellaco has me' a while ago
