Pony Up LyricsThrow down your wallets, turn out your pockets, This ain’t no night in, we’re going all in
Gonna make a little go all the way
Make a million dollars outta pocket change
We’re talkin dive bars, bar rail and PBR
Drop every cent we got, tallboys and Dickel shots No waiting in line no VIP
Just neon signs selling something cheap

C’mon break out all your nickels and dimes Cause there ain’t no price on a good time


Pony Up! If there’s trouble we gon’ find it Pony Up! If there’s a buzz we gon’ ride it Pony Up! Make it rain ‘till that sun’s risin’ We’re ridin’ high tonight on twenty bucks
So throw your money down and fill your cup Pony Up!
Pony Up!

We’re dollar store queens, know how to party
Roll in with no cash, still lookin high class
What we can’t buy we’ll get for free
Cause we get by on being sweet

C’mon break out all your nickels and dimes Cause there ain’t no price on a good time

Pony Up!
If there’s trouble we gon’ find it
Pony Up!
If there’s a buzz we gon’ ride it
Pony Up!
Make it rain ‘till that sun’s risin’
We’re ridin’ high tonight on twenty bucks
So throw your money down and fill your cup
Pony Up!
Pony Up!

Throw down your wallets, turn out your pockets
Still haven’t paid the rent but we goin’ all in

Pony Up!
If there’s trouble we gon’ find it
Pony Up!
If there’s a buzz we gon’ ride it
Pony Up!
Make it rain ‘till that sun’s risin’
We’re ridin’ high tonight on twenty bucks
So throw your money down and fill your cup
Pony Up!
