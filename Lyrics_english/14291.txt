Lucy Lyrics [Lucy "Lucy" Ft. 2Fingz]

[Intro: Lomepal]
Brain saturated like a train as soon as there is a little strike
No break, even if the tires are thinking
We chat, we will see this our mistakes create
Bad Boys do not know the regrets
Brain saturated like a train as soon as there is a little strike
No break, even if the tires are thinking
We chat, we will see this our mistakes create
Bad Boys do not know the regrets
[Verse 1: Lomepal]
Generation ballin ', lose everything on an all-in, hey
Nothing is solid, life is a huge school courtyard
We do the opposite of what must do the police, where madness lacks
I don't like you but I'm well brought up, if I fuck your mother for you, I do it politely
Luxury or unemployment, lobster or ricard
We are good than to party as in Kusturica films
But I will know what to do if a sign is a sign
Improvise, I was good: I made my clips with Adrien, Momo and Yassine (order)
My liver is fragile like an empty demonstration
I have to love my dirty manies quickly
I learned nothing, I still vomited on it like a student
Outside, I am repugnant, inside, I'm beautiful (I'm beautiful)
Fuck the big boat, we lead our own boat (own boat)
There is a thuna tree and the devil wants us to make a propale
There is what it takes to forget in the brown bag
We only talk about girls but we spend most of our time between men as in the Brokeback mountains (break)
As long as my rhyme takes me in something less annoying
Smoking, it creates connections but it gives me too many questions
That's why I need to drink at the same time (Hey, Hey)
This super planet leaves in this lukewarm
But the devil continues to repeat to me that there is never enough sugar there
Must fall day and night, seven out of seven
We improve but the achievements will never be won enough to rest from SSUS (nan)
By dint of repeating how to repair the flaws, my voice is (yeah)
I have serious techniques
If we forced all these little sluts of leaders to take ayahuasca, the planet would be better (hey, hey, hey)
Too bad we have to have that to open your eyes
My fellows want to make Thuns before seeing the last night cover the heavens
Are you different? Stop your jokes, you're cute
Even you, you will do everything to have billions
If one day you win millions (Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
I don't say that it is a good reasoning
But provided that I am expanding everything with real friends (Ouh)
Find a good reason to have lived, we are almost there
Together we live, together we will burn until the last embers
Squad until death like MS-13
It speaks politics for up to five hours by smoking hash (smoking hash)
My brothers want me to believe that M'Baise society
I don't see him, my head in the chemtrails

Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (yup, yup, yup)
Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (Hey)
Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (Hey)
Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (Hey)
Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (you don't really like 6-6-6)
Fuck the sy-sy-system, you don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you (Hey)

[Bridge: Nepal]
Yo
You don't like 6-6-6 too much but the 6-6-6 loves you
Seven five, 2Fingz
Dolo Ocho Juego Ocho

[Verse 2: Nepal & Doum's]
They finished when there was more ivory by digging Lucy
We know the story everyone is lying, what is it lucid?
I don't have my license or a DEUG but they can wait at the factory
I have far too dreamed of doing the thug, too late to apologize
Where did it go by the whole interests that we deduced?
There is no need to say the call of the vice turned out to be loud and very harmful
During this time, we know our lyrics better than those of the Bible
I have a concern for detail, like a crunch-mort the day he wrapped himself
Posed in a wagon of the 12, I attend the beginnings of Matrix
My friends run away and loot, ride the wave on pneumatic beds
Life in pink has put it backwards, I call it Buu-Majin
For me, it's green, for them, it will be little pochtars of Blue Magic
In club, we drop the bottles, do not play stupid when you rinses
I have the endurance of a coke seller from Honduras
Super proud, hey, we have all the artefacts
Life yeah, it's hard sometimes, some end up out of play
Aboard the interstellar a prayer in the shape of vows
Life is not Arte, Fuck, Demonic as Hortefeux
Not as a goal to be your model, I'm neither your father or your brother
Market laws are austere: either you pay or you believe
Politicians call us lazy but their posts are fictitious
Seem solid to you but do not have the soleuces of dark collective
Standing on the convertible, you do shoot like Kennedy
Everyone would like a better world and in the end what about? 19embed
