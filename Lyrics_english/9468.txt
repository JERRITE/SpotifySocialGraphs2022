If You Dream Lyrics[Verse 1: Tank]
I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

[Pre-Chorus: Omarion]
Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome
[Chorus:]
If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream 'cause a dream's unstoppable

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton and Faith Evans]
I could have gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close
Storms and rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up 'cause I know

[Pre-Chorus: Tyrese and JoJo]
Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

[Chorus:]
If you dream then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream 'cause a dream's unstoppable

[Bridge:]
Dream that you can fly
Dream that you can climb
Dream a mountain
All you gotta do is just
You might also likeDream that you can win
Dream with confidence
Dream to the very end
'Cause dreamers become champions

Dream until it's real
Dream, don't let them kill your
Dream the fight still is in you
All you gotta do is

Dream, just keep the faith
Dream, don't ever break
Dream, don't let it slip away
'Cause all you gotta do

[Pre-Chorus: Tank]
Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
All you gotta do is dream

Dream then you can do anything
Dream, you're halfway to destiny
Dream, dream's unstoppable
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream1Embed
