Devilâ€™s Plaything Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a flame
A devil's thing
A violent storm
About to be born
Just look in these eyes
See all the lies
All these things you see
You cannot deny

[Verse 2]
And this flame
That burns inside
If you get too close
Burn you alive
Just look in these eyes
And see if they lie
All these words I speak
You cannot deny
[Verse 3]
Got a light
Shines on me
Gentle light
It will never be
See the flame
In my hand
If you're playing with fire
You're playing in Hell

[Chorus]
Devil's plaything
In my hands
If you don't want pain
You don't understand
Got a light
Shines on me
If you wanna touch flames
Come unto me

[Verse 4]
Got a flame
Burns inside
If you don't wanna burn
Just walk on by
And the pain
You're feeling now
Is nothing compared
To the pleasures I hide
You might also like[Chorus]
Devil's plaything
In my hands
If you don't want pain
You don't understand
Got a light
Shines on me
If you wanna touch flames
Come unto me

[Verse 5]
Got a flame
In my hand
If you don't want a fire
Step out of my light
Walk on by
Just look away
'Cause if you're on my path
You're better off dead

[Chorus]
Devil's plaything
In my hands
If you don't want pain
You don't understand
Got a light
Shines on me
If you wanna touch flames
Then Come unto me5Embed
