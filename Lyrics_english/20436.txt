MORE LOVE Lyrics [verse 1]
I think I saw you somewhere
Your smile seems to me everywhere again
And again there is not enough vitamin, ha.
My love with you indivisible, ha.
I think I saw you somewhere
Your smile seems to me everywhere again
And again there is not enough vitamin
My love with you indivisible
My love is mine, no one threw it
I hear a lot of words, I don't play with them
We can do everything, we have seven religions
My love and these things are indivisible
[Chorus]
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE

[Verse 2]
Give me more love, yes
I froze alone here
Yes, I believe in a miracle
I believe in a miracle, not business
Dad and mom were brought up like this
That I am in love all
My lifetail did not take out
Yes, you are angry, you are Bitches (Motherfucker Fuckboy)
Hey, fakbo, sit down in the Merce (Skrrt-Skrrt)
I'm going to the subway, Yes (Skrrt-Skrrt)
Yes, I'm going to your ex
Give me more love, and I will give her everything that is

[Chorus]
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE

What a pleasant color of the sun
The same pleasant color of the sky
And the city is like in watercolors
From our cozy bed
What a pleasant color of the sun
The same pleasant color of the sky
And the city is like in the palm of your hand
Falls in love with a bit boldly

[Chorus]
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
MORE LOVE
More Love, Baby
