I imagine Lyricseye Melow I imagine dancing on the album
I RI RI BUSINESS ... TO BELOW
I look at you & I imagine with clothes making love
Well turned on with clothes making love
On the album well arisco with clothes making love
And eh huh with clothes making love
& None compares her name Sara
I like his bad face is crazy about my panas
The clothes are brave & stay as if nothing
He sang to him as I imagined it
I look at you & I imagine with clothes making love
Well turned on with clothes making love
On the album well arisco with clothes making love
And eh huh with clothes making love (... ey)
I don't look at her, look at me look my son
Because you look at me like that I said easy
It is that I have a note that is from afar it shows
I imagine the note
With clothes making love
Ha ... & you know it normal
So don't look at me wrong
With that bad face
& that ass that seems that it is approve of bullets
It is something supernatural with clothes making love
But without any love
I GIVE 4 PALOS DE RON & I GET WONE
I turned on like a Blond Prenio
Celebrating the clothes you & I repeat
I look at you & I imagine with clothes making love
Well turned on with clothes making love
On the album well arisco with clothes making love
And eh huh with clothes making love
I look at you & I imagine without clothes on my way
I would do it on the album what fate
She knows that I travel & every time I travel
Whenever I hit the grain without perspective
From airport to the hotel to disk
I arrived at the Vip & to I was ready
A Wiskisito to the Rock in the Bareto without Pepa
I am for you to know my paque who knows
Aja ... you chew the suit that got it down
I am leaving tomorrow & I want to take advantage of the passage
So let me see that landscape
Walk as if it is a modeling casting
I look at you ... & I imagine ...
Well turned on ... with clothes making love
On the album well arisco ... with clothes making love
And eh eh eh ... with clothes making love
& None compares her name Sara
I like his bad face is crazy about my panas
The clothes are brave & stay as if nothing
He sang to him as I imagined it
I look at you & I imagine with clothes making love
Well turned on with clothes making love
On the album well arisco with clothes making love
And eh huh with clothes making love
