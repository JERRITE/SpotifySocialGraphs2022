Orbit lyrics [lyrics for "orbit"]

[Part 1]
Table full of cups
Leaf gold sect glass
Live my yesterday, Ey Yeah
SMS from the ex degree
I'm sorry you are unlucky
But I have been running since you were gone, Ey Yeah
Don't ask if I want to exchange with you
I get out, even under thousands
The exact same mouth that said "I don't need you"
Now kiss the ground on which I am running
A to B, I'm always on the go now
Keep the drinks for yourself, I survive it
You want to kiss the back of your hand, but see
My hands are busy counting
No, we don't miss anything
[Pre-refrain]
The reflection has always been my role model
Visions big, the limit is the orbit
I'm looking for the adventure, you are looking for caution
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
I want the world that it also costs
No time for head fuck, head fuck
From your chick to a boss bitch, boss bitch
I'm a maker, I don't hope, don't hope
I want the world that it also costs
No time for Gossip, Gossip
You see the appearance and hope he rusts, rusts
But if I fall, then I land soft, yeah, soft, yeah

[Part 2]
I need it faster
Make-up sits better
After the kickdown in Benzer, Ey Yeah
Golden plate
Am the real-life-cinderella
Nikes to match the sweater
I run over and they turn
Ass and hips move
The appearance is epic
Am guest list plus ten bitches
Made a lot, but I'm still more real
As eight out of ten in the scene
Four million on Insta
And you hope to mention you
Oh no
Rappers stand in line for a selfie or photo
500k in cash pay me for promo
Early small room, today I buy a few apartments
Look, I did it without you, I do it solo
You might so like [pre-refrain]
The reflection has always been my role model
Visions big, the limit is the orbit
I'm looking for the adventure, you are looking for caution
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
I want the world that it also costs
No time for head fuck, head fuck
From your chick to a boss bitch, boss bitch
I'm a maker, I don't hope, don't hope
I want the world that it also costs
No time for Gossip, Gossip
You see the appearance and hope he rusts, rusts
But if I fall, then I land soft, yeah, soft, yeah7embed
