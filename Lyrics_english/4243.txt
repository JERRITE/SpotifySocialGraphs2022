Alócate Lyrics [lyrics by "Alócate"]

[Chorus]
Alócate and become mine
That the night asked for it, fate decided
I know you felt the same as me and still
We have a little while to form the scandal
Unless you don't decide (EH)

[Post-car]
Yes no, I don't know if not
You feel like me
Tell me if not, tell me if not (if not-oh, if not-oh)
Yes no, I don't know if not
You would like to heat my body
Tell me if not, tell me if not (if not-oh, if not-oh)
[Verse 1]
GIVE MAMITA, WE GO TO THE GRAIN
I am not guide understand and understand
That I am the zion
That when I sing to you, you keep dancing
That while I boots, I keep enjoying
I feel good exotic we are going
If we continue we kill ourselves
Do not be wrong you well you know
How is Zion
Follow up wrapping this
It's beginning

[Chorus]
Alócate and become mine
That the night asked for it, fate decided
I know you felt the same as me and still
We have a little while to form the scandal
Unless you don't decide

[Bridge]
And no vemo ', vemo' in the duel, duel
Without fear, fear is not play, game
You know that I am the one who causes you temptation
And no vemo ', vemo' in the duel, duel
Without fear, fear is not game
You know that I am the one who wants your body

Yes no, I don't know if not
You would like to warm up in my body
Tell me, if not, tell me, if not
Yes no, I don't know if not
You would like to heat my body
Tell me, if not, tell me, if not

[Chorus]
Alócate and become mine
That the night asked for it, fate decided
I know you felt the same as me and still
We have a little while to form the scandal
Unless you don't decide
