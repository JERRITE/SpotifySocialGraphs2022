TranslationEnglishamor forbidden Lyrics [letter of "forbidden love"]

[Verse 1]
With crazy desires I want to see you today
I await that moment when I listen to your voice
And when we finally be together
What does it matter what will say, your father and your mother
Here is only our love, I love you

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, they murmur in the streets
Because we are from different societies
Forbidden love, everyone tells us
Money does not matter in you and me
Nor in the heart
Oh, baby
[Verse 2]
Although I am poor, all this I give you
It is worth more than money because it is love
And when we finally are together, the two
What does what will say, also society
Here is only our love, I love you

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, they murmur in the streets
Because we are from different societies
Forbidden love, everyone tells us
Money does not matter in you and me
Nor in the heart
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, they murmur in the streets
Because we are from different societies
Forbidden love, everyone tells us
Money does not matter in you and me
Nor in the heart
Oh, baby
Forbidden love, they murmur in the streets
Because we are from different societies
Forbidden love, everyone tells us Might Also Like14embed
