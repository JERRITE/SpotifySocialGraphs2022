Dr. No LyricsDr. No, Dr. No, can you hear what I say?
Throw me a bone 'cause I'm trying to stay sane
I'm half fried, all tied up in this bed
Got moonshine blues from my head to my legs

Dr. No, Dr. No
Dr. No, Dr. No

There are sharks in the water and the water's deep

Lock the door, give me more, don't you spin on a dime
Just do me a favour, we'll call it another dollar
Take me to the hollow with a flash bang wallop

Dr. No, Dr. No
Dr. No, Dr. No

And there is only one thing that I learned from the distances we travelled

That is that there are sharks in the water and the water's deep
Sharks in the water, the water's deep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
Sharks in the water and they're swimming in their...

There are sharks in the water and the water's deep
Sharks in the water, the water's deep
Well I pray that the Lord my soul will keep
Sharks in the water and they're swimming in their sleep
