Loose Change Lyrics[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
(Back with my people)
Uh
Yo, yo, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt]
You be with the boys and I'ma be with the dawgs
Blood on the Travies, it serve as a challenge coin
I'm the voice, I had to speak for the org, pastor, preacher
Smashed up weed on the organ, master teachings
Actually couldn't hold me (Who's gonna stop me?)
I was hungry
Mama made her son read, so I'm hunting glances 'til the peak
That still didn't feed me
I had to get a feel for the whole thing
Peek in the orbs, speak on what I absorb
Reserved boundariеs, I found a different route to еxplore and run around deep
I told you 'bout the reaching, you found out and screamed, that sound to me like a loss
I had a bad bout with grief and I tossed a match on it
Kerosene, burned the ring down to ashes
And memories, feather feet behind
And ahead of the beat, throwing 'em off
Arriving in the nick of time
[Chorus]
These niggas nickel and diming
I'm giving 'em five and sliding, my way up the street
Pretty penny, you my luckiest find, skin copper
Titties bouncing, save a generous slice for me
Please (I need a piece of this, about this small)
Please, save a generous slice for me
Change jingling in my pocket
These niggas nickel and diming
I'm giving 'em five, pretty penny, you my luckiest find, skin copper
Titties bouncing, save a generous slice for me
(Please, please, please, please)You might also like4Embed
