[Intro: Rauw Alejandro & Selena Gomez]
Baby, I don't know if you talk a lot
If you understand 'when I say "my love"
Eat without understanding 'e' better
I just have to like '
You want me to fall into temptations
Look how it puts me
That accent you have
I don't understand much, but come
[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Rauw Alejandro]
Dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, that I follow you
Pégate, come, take over
Do not go without them 'to come back
Therefore, dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, what do I follow you
Kiss me just once
Thus, a reason for seeing you again (Rauw)

[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & Selena Gomez]
Honestly, let this flow, do not continue to mind
I have 'to'a the night to show me' in front
Everything you feel '
It smells like it has nothing innocent (Yah, Yah)
How do I tell you that I don't want to talk about love?
That if it is with you, I have to think better
Quiet, leave it like this, I want to stay here
Pégate, come to me, get, come to me

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Rauw Alejandro]
Dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, that I follow you
Pégate, come, take over
Do not go without them 'to come back
Therefore, dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, that I follow you
Kiss me just once
Thus I have a reason to see you again (Yah!)
