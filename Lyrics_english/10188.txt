Live Without It Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna meet somebody
I don't wanna meet somebody like you
I don't wanna grief nobody
Better off with nothing to do
You're now all I see
With every touch you're bringing me to life
Leaving me terrified

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tell me if I'm dreaming
Finally found a feeling
Pull me in the deep end and out
Cause you run this game
[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna live without it
I don't wanna take the pain away
Cause I know that I'm lost without it
Loving you is the best mistake I've made
I've never been one to panic
But I can feel you running through my veins
So I don't want to live, I don't want to live
I don't want to live without it

[Verse 2]
You've always been somеbody
You've always been the type to choosе
And I don't wanna crash your party
But all I want is to belong with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You set my world on fire
Is hell and heaven
Right before my eyes
Leaving me terrified

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna live without it
I don't wanna take the pain away
Cause I know that I'm lost without it
Loving you is the best mistake I've made
I've never been one to panic
But I can feel you running through my veins
So I don't want to live, I don't want to live
I don't want to live without it
You might also like[Bridge]
Tell me if I'm dreaming
Finally found a feeling
Pull me in the deep end and out
Cause you run this game

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna live without it
I don't wanna take the pain away
Cause I know that I'm lost without it
Loving you is the best mistake I've made
I've never been one to panic
But I can feel you running through my veins
So I don't want to live, I don't want to live
I don't want to live without it

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna live without it
I don't wanna take the pain away (take the pain away)
Cause I know that I'm lost without it
Loving you is the best mistake I've made (the best mistake I've made)
I've never been one to panic
But I can feel you running through my veins (through my veins)
So I don't want to live, I don't want to live
No, I don't want to live without it
[Outro]
Oh, woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh (through my veins)
Oh, woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh (take the pain away)
Oh, woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
So I don't want to live, I don't want to live
I don't want to live without it1Embed
