Teach me lyrics [verse 1: Anahí]
It is pain to know that ours
It can end
Because simply and simply
I have never known how to act
And I know you die for me, you live for me
And you have never left me behind
Although you know that sometimes
I'm just fear

[Pre-car: Anahí and Dulce]
But you live in me, next to me
Inside me
In this confused heart
That's why I ask you please
[Choir: Anahí and Dulce, both and Maite, all and Christian]
Teach me to love you a little more
And to feel with you the love you give me
The cold fades, I want to see you already
Teach me to love you a little more
And to live with you that I can't stand anxiety
Of knowing you, I want to go where you are

[Verse 2: Anahí]
Far from thinking
I'm doing wrong
I have to admit
That all this has come badly
That's why I'm going to learn, I'm going to live
I'm going to hug you more and more
And I don't want, and I shouldn't
And I can't stop seeing you (stop seeing you)

[Pre-Caro: Anahí and Dulce María]
Because you live in me, next to me
Inside me
In this confused heart
That's why I ask you please

[Choir: Anahí and Dulce, both and Maite, all and Christian]
Teach me to love you a little more
And to feel with you the love you give me
The cold fades, I want to see you already
Teach me to love you a little more
And to live with you that I can't stand anxiety
Of knowing you, I want to go where you are

Teach me
And to feel with you

Of knowing you, I want to go where you are about
