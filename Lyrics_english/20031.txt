Drain Your Dreams Lyrics[Chorus] x2
It's been a couple months
I'm feeling brand new
I found the truth
I'm living proof
Now what it do?
They told me look into the mirror, look at you
I don't want nothing from this world, I'm not like you

[Verse]
Don't want a dollar, you can have it
Used to hate everything because my heart was damaged
My mind a maze, can't understand it
I sipped that holy water, now I feel like magic
Fuck the devil, I don't need no one to trust
I got God on my side
Why you stuck?
In a rut
Out of luck
Windows up to the world
Why you losing everything you ever loved?
I almost sold my soul
I was in a hole
All alone
Tryna get my own but had nowhere to go
Why you talking like you know me?
You don't know
When I wake up in the morning thank the Lord
[Chorus] x2
It's been a couple months
I'm feeling brand new
I found the truth
I'm living proof
Now what it do?
They told me look into the mirror, well look at you
I don't want nothing from this world, I'm not like youYou might also likeEmbed
