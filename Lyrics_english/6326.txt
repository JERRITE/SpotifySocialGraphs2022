Everywhere I Go (Kings and Queens) LyricsDowntown hopping fences
I smashed a window on a Lexus
Now 5-0’s on my tail, but they movin’ like a snail
I got some shit to sell
But everybody’s gotta get by
I got holes in my pockets
Everybody wants to stay high
So you know I got it, if you want it

This one’s for everyone that said I'm nothing
This one’s for my friends that don’t give a fuck
So if you don’t give a fuck sing:
Everywhere I go, I’m higher than United, fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep ‘till Brooklyn, no sleep
We get high, we get by, yet we roll with it
We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

I got prior offensives
You know this life it can be hectic
Now it might seem like a death wish
Being so young and fucking reckless
Everybody’s gotta get by
I got holes in my pockets
Everybody wants to stay high
So you know I got it, if you want it

This one’s for everyone that said I’m nothing
This one’s for my friends that don’t give a fuck
So if you don’t give a fuck sing:

Everywhere I go, I’m higher than united fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep ‘til Brooklyn, no sleep
We get high, we get by, yet we roll with it
We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

This one’s for the ones who are not in love
To my ex, to my mom, to my dad, and the teachers
My boss, and the cops, oh my God all the preachers
All the give, and the take, and the take, and the give
Now we’ve taken enough, it’s enough so just sing:

Everywhere I go, I'm higher than united fly with me
Everybody knows, there’s no sleep 'til Brooklyn, no sleep
We get high, we get by, yet we roll with it
We’ve been up, we’ve been down, we got over it
Everywhere we go, we’re the kings and queens, and we run this city

We’re the kings and queens and we run this city
We’re the kings and queens and we run this city9Embed
