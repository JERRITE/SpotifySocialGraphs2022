Lovers in the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the wind

[Verse 2]
Life is all we have to share
You know we must take care
Lovers in the wind

[Chorus]
There was a time, when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know, and no one wants to try
[Verse 3]
Love is all I have to give
It's all I need to live
Lovers in the wind

[Chorus]
There was a time, when it was hard to know
Reaching out, reaching out for somewhere to go
There was a light born on the darkest day
But no one wants to know, and no one wants to cry

[Verse 4]
Time is always on the run
We've only just begun
Lovers in the windYou might also like1Embed
