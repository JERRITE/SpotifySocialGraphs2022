Love Overdose Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, you said you can't stand when nobody
I've got you all alone tonight
Yet I'm without you now and I can't even tell you why

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you said you can't stand when nobody else calls you
No, they don't fuck you like I fuck you
No, they don't own you like I owned you
I know you came when I approached you
[Chorus]
Love, tell me you'll kill anybody for me
Be the naughty girl I want to see
Different clues in the words that you speak
We get deep
I love all of the things that you said we would be
Good to know that you see what I see
I'm so proud of the girl you could be
Just for me

[Verse 1]
Baby, just hurry
Get your ass in the car and pull up
Get it on me
I knеw that you was wet the second you callеd me
Baby, you said you was lonely
Baby, you said that you want me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you said you can't stand when nobody else calls you
No, they don't fuck you like I fuck you
No, they don't own you like I owned you
I know you came when I approached you

[Chorus]
Love, tell me you'll kill anybody for me
Be the naughty girl I want to see
Different clues in the words that you speak
We get deep
I love all of the things that you said we would be
Good to know that you see what I see
I'm so proud of the girl you could be
Just for me

Pull up in a coupe too late but she still came downstairs
It's after 3AM there
And I know that she wanna' take a ride in my sixty-six with no lights
Blondie, like The Dixie Chicks, we so high
She wanna make love and fuck in one night
She wanna get licked and split
She won't list her fix, 'less you feed her sixty-six lines
Girl, I got that medicine in my eyes
Girl, I got the juice that spread to your thighs
Girl, I got the inches I could supply
She told me to kiss her when I'm inside
She told me to look her deep in her eyes
She told me "That pussy tell you no lies"
Yeah, but

[Chorus]
Love, tell me you'll kill anybody for me
Be the naughty girl I want to see
Different clues in the words that you speak
We get deep
And I love all of the things that you said we would be
It's good to know that you see what I see baby
I'm so proud of the girl you could be
Just for me
[Outro]
Baby, you said you can't stand when nobody else calls you
No, they don't fuck you like I fuck you
No, they don't own you like I owned you
I know you came when I approached you1Embed
