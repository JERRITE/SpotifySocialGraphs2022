Make It Shine (Victorious Theme) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am, once again
Feeling lost but now and then
I breathe it in to let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you don't know where you are now
Or what it would come to, if only somebody could hear
When you figure out how
You're lost in the moment, you disappear
[Chorus]
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action
You're never gonna fade, you'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy, just remember me
When it turns out right
'Cause you know that if you live in your imagination
Tomorrow, you'll be everybody's fascination
In my victory, just remember me
When I make it shine

[Verse 2]
Reachin' high, feelin' low
I'm holding on but letting go
I like to shine, I'll shine for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it's time to show the world how
It's a little bit closer, as long as I'm ready to go
All we have is right now
As long as you feel it inside, you know

[Chorus]
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action
You're never gonna fade, you'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy, just remember me
When it turns out right
'Cause you know that if you live in your imagination
Tomorrow, you'll be everybody's fascination
In my victory, just remember me
When I make it shine

Everyone can tell you how it's all been said and done
That harder times will change your mind
And make you wanna run
But you want it, and you need it
Like you need to breathe the air
If they doubt you, just believe it
That's enough to get you there

[Chorus]
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action
You're never gonna fade, you'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy, just remember me
When it turns out right (turns out right)
'Cause you know that if you live in your imagination
Tomorrow, you'll be everybody's fascination
In my victory, just remember me
When I make it shine2Embed
