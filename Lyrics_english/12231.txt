Breathe Into Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
And this is how it feels when I
Ignore the words you spoke to me
And this is where I lose myself
When I keep running away from you
And this is who I am when
When I don't know myself anymore
And this is what I choose when
It's all left up to me

[Chorus]
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling
Falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
(Falling, falling)
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
[Verse 2]
And this is how it looks when
I am standing on the edge
And this is how I break apart
When I finally hit the ground
And this is how it hurts when I
Pretend I don't feel any pain
And this is how I disappear
When I throw myself away

[Chorus]
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling
Falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
(Falling, falling)
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me

[Chorus]
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling
Falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
(Falling, falling)
Breathe into me
You might also like[Chorus]
Breathe your life into me
I'm falling
Falling faster
Breathe your life into me
Falling, falling, falling

[Outro]
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
