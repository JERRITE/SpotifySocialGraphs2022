Fuck Up The Summer Lyrics(Hook)

I came to f*ck up the summer
F*ck up the summer
I came to f*ck up the summer
F*ck up the summer
The Spring, the Fall and the Winter yeah The Spring, the Fall and the Winter yeah (x2)


(Verse 1: TM)
(Look)
Shout out to niggas that's still dropping tracks
Shout out to shawty that still halla back Killed the rap game back when I was 14 Now all my niggas f*cking here like an orgy
I'm all about the ball like its the lottery Leader of the prodigies
Nigga my apology
Even my momma is so proud of me Hanging with the stars, now that's astronomy
F*ck these niggas, man their lines is so kinda related
And I've been f*cking up the game and it's finally pregnant
Like I'm having a baby
I been heavily patient
So I can scream out at the top like "Nigga we made it!"
Aah b*tch I'm fresher than a Mentos F*cking up the game and now it's twisted like a Fritos
Went from swerving and dreaming about the billboards
Now I'm going H.A.M. on these cheeseboys (Woo)

(Hook)


(Verse 2: Ray)

(Yeah)
I came to f*ck up the summer
I been bitching on niggas like Karma
We swerving around now we hitting the stu
I'm hitting the gym but I'm never gone lose (that's f*cked up)
We on the roll gotta stay up
Gotta pray up
For all of my niggas to throw it like tantrum
Gave these niggas chills and fevers like I was ma'f*cken Ran-som
Blue dot, Grey Goose we're unlocking the summer
My city's so turnt but it's just full of drama
Your b*tch on my lap on a daily, haven't I told you it's my time?
Is it ironic the summer approached us now we finna f*ck up/
Step in the booth, we f*ck up the summer, they starring at us everytime we touch down/
