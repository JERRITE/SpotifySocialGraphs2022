Little by Little Lyrics[Hook-Josh Martinez and Sleep]
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…

[Verse 1-Sleep]
In reality, I’m just an average Joe with a simple life
No American idol but I get by
Wish I could tour with Fifth Wheel bus
Back to the real world, time to wake up
Smell antifreeze and now with big brothers
Bad to me, I’ve got a blind date with destiny
I’m Mexican, what an amazing race I get to be
Most days are wickedly perfect
You’re not affecting me
Making me nervous, I’m a survivor
The last on the planet deserted
Pass the word like a ten thousand dollar pyramid scheme
Changing the face of the game like a sworn medical team
Lead troopers, a league of supreme losers
Press your luck with Sleep; go home, the biggest loser
I’ll have the last laugh like the last comic standing
Making the band play as you walk off stage empty handed
And I’m, taking home America’s next top model
Back to the bachelor pad, show her some Longfellow…
[Hook-Josh Martinez and Sleep]
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…

[Hook-Josh Martinez and Sleep]
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…

[Verse -Josh Martinez]
Little by little, grow a little more bitter
Sit down in my chair like a grown man to his dinner
Where’s my newspaper, boy? Dog, fetch me my slippers
Feed me, do the dishes, if you need me, I’m in the shitter
With everybody so emo everyone expects emotion
While I’m holding onto long-term solution to that notion
That everything my story, shown off, be bared
Be thrown into the lions as if the crowd cared
Some are born like us, most important like them
Some will live to the fullest; some will die in the system
Just trying to live the natzi
I admire the mission; acquire the license to listen
We’re the fire the passim
You might also likeSo where’s my welfare? Where’s my healthcare?
Where’s my sandwich? There’s my sandwich
Spin doctors spinning, old white men grinning
Power to the rival, end to its bidding

Can you think of a single thing you’ve done
That’s meant anything, anything at all?
I know I’ll probably take the fall…
I was going into circles till I hit the wall…

Can you think of a single thing you’ve done
That’s meant anything, anything at all?
I know I’ll probably take the fall…
I was going into circles till I hit the wall…

[Verse 3-Josh Martinez]
I’m absolutely sure one day I’ll settle down
Find a special spot, My best gal and some mescal
Got trees growing, got a flower garden going
Couple herbs for the cooking, couple more for the smoking
Got a hammock for the swinging, fresh tomatoes for the salad
That’ll compliment the burgers straight cookin’ on the grill
Still I drink myself stupid; I can’t walk home alone
Need a shoulder to lean on, I need a cold beer, come on

[Sleep]
Music’s my meal ticket, if I could keep living on beer to get
Time’s ticking like weed in your mind and you don’t get it
No ace in the hole and the weight of the game
Is breaking your soul, keep changing your game
Playing the role
Keep on selling my family short, like toll caritas
Just let it linger, hard to turn the other cheek with broken fingers
And I, humbled myself till I was hollow inside
But no more, I get this and you can swallow my pride!
[Hook-Josh Martinez and Sleep]
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…

[Hook-Josh Martinez and Sleep]
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…
Little by little by little by
I’m going crazy…4Embed
