Ab-Soul - Terrorist Threats (ft. Danny Brown & Jhené Aiko) (Traduction Française) Lyrics[Intro: Ab-Soul & Jhene Aiko]
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know﻿ me
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know﻿ me
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can’t fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can’t fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can’t fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can’t fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Babylon, Babylon
Out my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I’d have plenty of flows
If I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I woulda more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs - just to name a few
I do drugs, Mama say it’s in my blood
But she don’t know what the fuck I’ve been through
To creep through the back door, the typical black boy in the good old U-S-A
Before I pushed rhymes like weight, I used to wanna play for the NBA
Fuck I’m doing talking bout pineal gland
Ancient ways of Sumerians
Ain’t nothing wrong with a righteous man
This why I had to write this man
For my niggas on the corner
Selling water to somebody’s daughter
Fluctuating prices man
I ain’t got no gavel
I ain’t tryna fight nobody battle
I-I just wanna be free
I ain’t tryna be nobody's chattel

Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Extra pills, Extra pills
Them AK Clips stay extra peeled
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on errythang
If we could link up erry gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We’d put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We mobbin' like we the black KKK
Don’t forget my AKA Mayday
Pee on your P-H-D or your AA
Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet but I’m giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain’t nothing
And I just love it, I hope it don’t stop
I don’t give a damn, nigga bang that block
I don’t give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
Peep the concept
You’ve got progress, you’ve got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain’t got no gavel
I ain’t finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain’t finna be nobodies chattel
[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we’d stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Extra pills, extra pills
Nose candy rain like Soul 4 Real
My baby needs some enfamil
So bags get stuffed like Oprah grill
Pull around, come back, oh forreal?
Top blew off, low fuzz appeal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Feeling if he know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay
Don’t try to stop it, get in my way
You’ll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK-melee, make ya obey, okay?
Feel my pain, going insane, I’m ashamed
Cause I ain’t got shit but an EBT card from a fiend
That owe me and it’s in her daughter name
How the fuck is they pose to eat?
How the fuck am I pose to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you, you don’t give a fuck about me
Can’t get a job if they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed depressed
Got a feeling in his chest
And the world’s stripped of happiness
I ain’t got no gavel
I ain’t tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain’t finna be nobodies chattel5Embed
