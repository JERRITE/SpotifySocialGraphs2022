[Verse 1: Alexis]
You take me to heaven, play, caramel
Move those hips, put your hair (wuh)
Show that you are the one who breaks the ground
I'm ready for duel
Another like you have never seen any
With you I would share my fortune
If it were for me I take charge of you
And we were going to live for the moon
You have something between the unreal, the supernatural
That beauty that you have a special heart
I like 'so much, so much, so much
If here I had you, I did not leave the room (oh yaah)
Come, move your body
That I am paralyzed to 'the system (It's True)
You are perfect, you have everything
I want you to be my girl, Lady (Everything)
I like it 'so much, so much, so much (Yeah)
You don't realize
That I tremble when I sing (Big Up, Big Up, Oh)
