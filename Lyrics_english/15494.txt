THE STREET OF THE SIRENAS (LIVE) LYRICS [LETTER OF "LA CALLE DE LAS SIRENAS"]

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The street, the street, the street

THE STREET OF LAS SIRENAS
THE STREET OF LAS SIRENAS
THE STREET OF LAS SIRENAS
THE STREET OF LAS SIRENAS

They cross unicorns
That are white and jump without stopping
To the narrowest side of the street
If you look closely
You will find shoe sign
Fairy working a blue dress

It seems that they only raise the (look)
When the elves pass (they pass)
To the castle, at the end of the street
It's right where it's hotter

OH-UH-OH
Imagine the sirens on the moon
OH-UH-OH
Soaking stars with paint

And princesses go dancing
With dresses that are flying
In a blue carriage

The dragon of this castle
He is sad and has a very bad mood
It is its crazy fire that gives heat (ah-ah-ah)

And the witch, her neighbor
Afternoon and night, a remedy will seek
Because the fire does not calm the fan or fan
You Might Also Likepodr√≠a spend my life with that (giant)
That everyone fears (fears)
And if I approach until I touched your hand
It tells me it's just a human being

OH-UH-OH
Imagine the sirens on the moon
OH-UH-OH
Soaking stars with paint

OH-UH-OH
Imagine The Mermaids Dancing on The Moon
OH-UH-OH
As you're painting the sky, The Stars Turns Bright and Blue

And princesses go dancing
With dresses that are flying
And princesses go dancing
With dresses that are flying

I, waddup?
With The Mermaids, The Faries and The Unicorns
You Think We Made 'Em Up Just To Put Them in The Song?
Do you Really Think We Care What You Think About Us?
About pop? About rock?
If we sing or dance all day
Doesn't Matter, We're Still Picturing the Times
There's nothing wrong with caring for romance
Let it show, let it Grow
Let the rhythm make me sick
You Motherfuckers, Where You Really Wanna Go?
(Imagine) OH-UH-OH
Imagine (Imagine) Sirens (AH-AH)
(Imagine) OH-UH-OH (AH-AH)
Soaking at (imagine) stars with paint
(Imagine) Embed
