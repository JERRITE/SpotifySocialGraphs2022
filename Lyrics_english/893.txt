It is damaged (remix) Lyrics [letter of "is damaged (remix)"]

[Intro: Iván Cornejo]
Is damaged from love
Does not feel any pain
His happiness ended
His hope disappeared

[Pre-Caro: Iván Cornejo]
He no longer believes in love, his faith ended
He no longer believes in love, rains every day in his world
[Choir: Iván Cornejo & Jhay Cortez]
His smile, his face
His little hands, oh, what delight
Oh, how beautiful your face is (yes, yes)

[Verse 1: Jhay Cortez]
His smile ended, a guy without light went out
The ship 'sank the ship
His tear 'made a puddle
Here I am with the first 'help'
Wanting without loving seems to me a suicide
He broke his heart how glass is broken '
How bottomless cards are broken
I don't want to see her, the еscondo
I took it for london
He is talking to me and Clara tells me: "No Condom"
Now he wants to take, he wants a teteo
Druno sends me video '
I filled it as a 'choliseo'
11:11, ask for a wish
And I fulfill it if I see you
In the Bentley I take a walk
When wanting 'can' fuck me
You calm, baby, that I do not block you

[Verse 2: Iván Cornejo & Jhay Cortez]
He moved very rich to reggaeton
Every night singing the song
That we dance, we kiss well drunk
And when you are crying, locked in your room
I hope you sing my song
