Have a Little Faith in Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark
And have a little faith in me

[Verse 2]
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me
[Chorus]
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me

[Verse 3]
When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin', from a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

[Verse 4]
And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you, you will see
I will catch you, I will catch your fall baby
Just have a little faith in me

[Chorus]
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me
And have a little faith in me

[Outro]
Well I've been loving you for such a long time girl
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time is our friend
'Cause for us there is no end
And all you gotta do is a have a little faith in me
I said a, I will hold you up
I will hold you up
And your love gives me strength in love
So have a little faith in me
I said a, hey hey
All you gotta do for me girl is
Have a little bit of faith in me
I said a, I said a, heyYou might also likeEmbed
