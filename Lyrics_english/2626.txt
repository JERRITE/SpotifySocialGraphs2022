Love Is Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
We don't even need to try
When it comes so naturally
There's no money that could buy
What we got, we got for free

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know (yeah)
We got a long, long way to go (yeah)
But it's a good, good thing to know (yeah)
I got you by my side, by my side
[Chorus]
This love is love
No need to run, we got nothing to hide (woah)
This love is love
It might be cold but I'm burning inside (yeah)
This love is love
We might be young, we might be blind
But we got fire to light the night
Fire to light the night

[Post-Chorus]
This love is love, is love, is love, is love, is love
This love is love, is love, is love, is love, is love (oh)

[Verse 2]
Uh, no we don't need to try
'Cause you already making this easy
Uh, no we don't need to talk
'Cause you already know what I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, we got a long, long way to go (yeah)
But it's a good, good thing to know (yeah)
I got you by my side, by my side

[Chorus]
This love is love
No need to run, we got nothing to hide (woah)
This love is love
It might be cold but I'm burning inside (yeah)
This love is love
We might be young, we might be blind
But we got fire to light the night
Fire to light the night

This love is love, is love, is love, is love, is love
This love is love, is love, is love, is love, is love (oh)
