Hover LyricsJust when I thought I've figured out some things
It's foolishness, I'm foolish
Just when I thought I'd figured out my purpose
It's foolishness
I call on stars, light a signal fire
Hope they hear and see, I wait on a promise

As I'm slowly losing hope and giving all control
A bright light, over dark skies, hovering

I set my soul towards the sun
I build an offering, I'm an offering
And like gravity, I'm slowly pulled
Drawing close to your atmosphere
As I'm slowly losing hope and giving all control
A bright light, over dark skies, hovering
As I'm slowly losing hope and giving all control
A bright light, over dark skies

Just when I thought I lost it all
I decide to engage, find belief in myself
Prey on the star and provoke them all
My eyes are open

A bright light
A bright light, hovering
A bright light
A bright light

As I'm slowly losing hope and giving all control
(As I slowly lose control)

A bright light, over dark skies, hovering
A bright light, the bright light
As I slowly lose control
A bright lightYou might also likeEmbed
