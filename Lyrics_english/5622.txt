Hide & Seek Lyrics[Intro: Äyanna]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus: Oxlade]
Oh, girl, you're shinin'
You know you're my diamond
You need remindin'
This moment of timin' when your
Soul needs alignin'

Seekin' and hidin'
You know where to find me, babe
[Post-Chorus: Teni & Oxlade]
Feeling

Diamonds
(You know where to find me, babe)

[Verse 1: Stormzy & Teni]
What's it gonna be? What we gonna do?
Here we go again, this ain't nothing new
I ain't tryna run game, but it's true 'cause you
(Came and you made me feel)
You call me for help, you gotta chill
Need time for yourself, you gotta heal
This ain't somethin' you felt, it's how you feel
(You came and you made me feel)
Aight, we built this all wrong, I'll takе blame
But instead of us tearin' it down, wе'll rearrange, baby
(Don't let it fall)
Don't let it fall, girl, don't let it fall

[Bridge: Äyanna]
Don't wanna fight no more
Keep me where I belong
I've tried and I've tried
But I just can't hide from your love

Oh, girl, you're shinin'
You know you're my diamond
You need remindin'
This moment of timin' when your
Soul needs alignin'
It's me you confide in
Seekin' and hidin'
You know where to find me, babe

[Post-Chorus: Teni & Oxlade]
Feeling (I can feel it)
Pressure
Pressure (Don't you get that?)
Diamonds (You know where to find me, babe)
Feeling (I can feel it)
Pressure (Feel the pressure)
Pressure
Diamonds (You're my diamond, oh)

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
What we lookin' for? Let me search now
Take your shoes off, put your purse down
How you gonna tell me that it's never gonna work now?
Type of shit to make me put a verse down
Worse now 'cah we made our bed and gotta lay in it
Thought it wasn't hard for me, but every day it is
Heartbreak's such a dark place, but we stay in it
What I'm sayin' is exactly what I say it is, I found you
I feel your presence when I'm not around you
Queen in your city, they need to crown you
Holy water, baby, let me drown you
Fire and water, I gotta 'low you
Burn out then reappear
Light still guidin' you home, you know I'm there
And rest assured if you ever needed help
Or just need a place to hide, know I'll keep it to myself, word
[Chorus: Oxlade]
Oh, girl, you're shinin'
You know you're my diamond
You need remindin'
This moment of timin' when your
Soul needs alignin'
It's me you confide in
Seekin' and hidin'
You know where to find me, babe

[Post-Chorus: Teni, Äyanna & Oxlade]
Feeling (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Pressure (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Pressure (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Diamonds (You know where to find me, babe)
Feeling (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Pressure (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Pressure (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Diamonds

[Post-Chorus: Teni & Oxlade]

Feeling (Soul needs alignin')
Pressure (It's me you confide in)
Pressure (Seekin' and hidin')
Diamonds (You know where to find me, babe)1Embed
