Ay Haiti! Lyrics ["Ay Haiti!"]

[David Summers]
There is someone out there
Someone who can hear me?
Is anything to be said
A miracle that makes us?

[Najwa]
They will have a few years
For a long time
They will have a few years
For a long time
[Baby]
There you have what is left, there you have the earth
Pa I returned to ará, pa clea, plant, built ...
There is empty without na
With tó willing to fill

[Alejandro Sanz]
There is love, there is in you, there is in my voice, oh ay haiti
There is love, there is in you, there is in my voice, oh ay haiti

[Miguel Bosé & Shakira]
There is love (there is love), there is in you (there is in you)
And in my voice (there is in my voice), ay ay haití

[Miguel Bosé & Zahara]
There is love (there is love), there is in you (there is in you)
And in my voice (and in my voice) ...

[David Otero]
Oh, there are lands that have no dreams
There are lands that tremble with fear

[Juanes]
There are lands that have peace
Haiti just wants to be normal

There is still reborn time
To ride about hunger and iron
There is still time to give love
Delete fear and destruction

[Todes]
There is love, there is in you, and in my voice, Ay Haiti
There is love, there is in you, and in my voice, Ay Haiti

[Marta Sánchez]
Ay Haiti, Ay Haiti
There is a sigh in your voice that awakens my heart

[Miguel Bosé]
A life stops desolation behind him
He is a lost child
That from dust illuminates with its light

[Leire (Lovg)]
There are lands that have no dreams
There are lands that tremble with fear

[Tow]
Let this crying unleash our faith
Buried in the same land that saw us born
[Belinda & Todes]
There is love, there is in you, and in my voice, Ay Haiti

[Todes]
There is love, there is in you, and in my voice, Ay Haiti

[Shakira]
Ay Haiti ... Ay Haiti ...
There is no silence in my voice
That I am a brick in your construction

[Macaque]
And way ay ay haiti
Today with you I want to be with you
Beredi-booming all hearts here

[La Mala Rodríguez]
He was born from the ashes Barón Samedí
I live for my people, keep feeling
Return me the men who went to fight for their fate
By his own dignity
How long is the debt for being black being rich?
The surplus is not enough to fill the snout
Listen to my prayer, Baron Samedí
I want to resurrect to see Haiti again

[Shakira & Enrique Iglesias]
You have to be born again, get lost again
Believe again, start again
You have to be born again, get lost again ...

[Baby]
Here are more than a few alive in your body
Because that's what there is, there is nothing more to do it
That is what there is, investment process
There is no choice but to build everything that collapsed

[Najwa & Carlos Jean]
You have to be born again, get lost again
Believe again, start again
You have to be born again, get lost again
Believe again...

[Alejandro Sanz]
There is love, there is in you, there is in my voice, oh ay haití ...

[Shakira]
There is love, there is in you and in my voice

[José Mercé]
There is love, there is in you with my voice
Oh Haiti

[Sandra Carrasco]
Listen to the bells that redouble

[Marta Sánchez]
Mmm ... ay haitíii ... aaoohhh

[Todes]
Oh, HaitiBed
