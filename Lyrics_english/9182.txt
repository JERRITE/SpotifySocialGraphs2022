Who U Wit Lyrics[Intro]
K-A-A
You know
Choose this day whom you gon serve

[Verse 1]
You know I'm still on a mission man, I'm still gon be spitting, till I spill my intentions and, you, got saved and was repping, then you strayed from the message, now you stay half-stepping, boy it's real, yeah, people still dying, still crying on the inside, Satan still lying, still tryna show the world how cool you is, ain't got a clue about whose you is, get, wit, the program, let em know man, it's real in the field, it's never been a show man, it ain't about hot beats and the flow man, but when you go, tell me where you gon go man? Is it the world or Christ? The girls and ice? Five minutes of fame or eternal life? Who u wit? Choose correctly, think, who protects me? When I reject Him, who accepts me? Holla

[Hook]
(Who u wit)
Are you in it to win mayne
Are you living in sin
Or are you living through Him mayne?
(Who u wit)
Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world
Cause the two don't mix y'all
(Who u wit)
What you need in life
The world can't give it to you
What you need is Christ
(Who u wit)
If you know Who you serve
And you roll with the Word
If ya so sincere
[Verse 2]
A lot of people live for the moment, they want it, they gotta flaunt it, they worship the money and the fast life, you hear em on the radio and see em on TV, in the sleazy, scenes, and then they wanna thank Christ, man, I'm hollerin bump that, I seen it in my backyard, dudes act hard, but I know they really lack God, man, dump that, they don't know that God is holy, He oppose the proud, but exalt the lowly, that's why I'm rollin with Him, my soul is with him, my treasures are up in heaven, yeah my gold is with Him, go with God or just don't go, you either watered down or you just don't know, and I'ma say this straight, so you do, man it's true, what they say, ain't no maps to heaven, there's only one Way, you heard it all of your life, the word is right, if you ain't servin Christ, then turn tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I used to be the dude talking bout, only God can judge me, you can't tell me nothing man, Jesus love me, but here I go again with the same old sin, the same old friends, coming to the same old end, it's like cheating on a test that you know you can't pass, still got to face the teacher's wrath after class, no point in doing it, you're ruining your life, tryna live it for the world instead of living it for Christ, I promise there's no extra love, for being bigger than 50, Diddy and Biggie in the heavens above, if you read like a Berean then act it out, be heaven's biggest promoter, try to pack it out, you could win you a crown and be down with the team and know that the bloodstream of Elohim redeems, it's Jesus, I don't say nothing else y'all, you ain't down with Him, you ain't down at all
