Let me cry Lyrics [letter of "Let me cry"]

[Verse 1]
How much empty there is in this room
So much passion hanging on the wall
How much sweetness diluting in time
So many autumn with you and without you, only

[Pre-car]
Millions of leaves falling on your body
Autumns crying dripping on your skin...
[Chorus]
Illuminated and eternal, enraged and calm
On a herb carpet you were flying asleep
An impossible silence by silencing my life
With a tear of you and a tear of mine

Illuminated and eternal, enraged and calm
On a herb carpet you were flying asleep
With a fleeting star I confused you the other night
And I asked you for three wishes while your light lasted

[Post-car]
Let me cry, let me cry, for you, let me cry

[Verse 2]
How many nostalgia sleeping in the attic
I have declared my life in solitude
I make love songs that I never forget
Well, on autumn clouds I write them, only

[Pre-car]
Millions of leaves falling on your body
Autumns crying dripping on your skin

[Chorus]
Illuminated and eternal, enraged and calm
On a herb carpet you were flying asleep
An impossible silence by silencing my life
With a tear of you and a tear of mine
You Might Also Likeluminada and eternal, enraged and quiet
On a herb carpet you were flying asleep
With a fleeting star I confused you the other night
And I asked you for three wishes while your light lasted

[Outro]
Let me cry, let me cry, let me cry
