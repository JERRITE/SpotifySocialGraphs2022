Smile again Lyrics [lyrics of "smiling again"]

[Intro]
Hey!
Of strong mind
It will be better
If you do not understand
Forget it

[Verse 1]
He cheated you again
Like Satan
You respect your respect
You want to kill him
You have hoped so long
That is going to change
No, he won't change
[Verse 2]
Pass all the time in the big city
Everyone lying, just to win
They look for success, money and do not want to strive
Nope! That's not real

[Pre Coro]
If you work hard, more than normal
You will go very far, good things will happen
It is the prize, to the effort
You will grow as a person, and your life will enjoy

[Chorus]
Woooah!
And don't forget your dreams
Woooah!
Be strong, and fight
Life is not a game
Woooah!
Do not lose your time anymore
Woooah!
Be strong, and fight
Let's fulfill those dreams

[Post choir]
Hey!
You must be strong
To be better
If you don't understand, forget it

So many blind people on a cell phone
Although it is very expensive they buy it the same
Encales for two years
And at home there is no bread
And selfie matters more

[Verse 4]
The old fool does not want to accept
Who is very sick, just to take
The lady has left him and her daughter does not want to look at him
He doesn't want to change

[Pre Coro]
If you work hard, more than normal
You will go very far, good things will happen
It is the prize, to the effort
You will grow as a person, and your life will enjoy

[Chorus]
Woooah!
And don't forget your dreams
Woooah!
Be strong, and fight
Life is not a game
Woooah!
And don't lose your time anymore
Woooah!
Be strong, and fight
Let's fulfill those dreams
[Outro]
Do not fear, smile again
Forgive, to be happy
I breathe, singing for you
Forgive, to be Happyembed
