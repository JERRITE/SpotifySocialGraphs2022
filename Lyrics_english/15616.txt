Dance my heart lyrics [lyrics by "Dance my heart"]

[Verse 1]
Ours is not a game, I can decipher
In the roulette of love you have to win
No matter what others think and think
Because what you make me feel like flying

[Chorus]
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
This is Love
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
This is Love
[Verse 2]
Your skin is fluorescent, shines in my darkness
In this party for two I want to dance
The moon and stars take me to you
I can only be happy if you are here

[Chorus]
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
This is love (OH-OH)
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
This is Love

[Bridge]
OH, OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH
OH, OH, OH-OH-OH-OH-OH

[Chorus]
Dance my heart, dance for both
This is love, oh-oh
This is love, OH-OH-OH
(I know it's love)
Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love

Dance my heart, dance my heart
Dance for both
I know it's love1embed
