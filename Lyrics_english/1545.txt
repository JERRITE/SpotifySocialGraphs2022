Lie to Me (feat. Julia Michaels) Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Change your flight so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right
[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you donâ€™t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me (Ah)
I know that you've been holding on to someone else
And now I can't sleep (Ah)
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

[Pre Chorus: Julia Michaels]
Flashing back to New York City
I was done, but you undid me
Classic me to run when it feels right

[Chorus: Luke & Julia Michaels]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While he's taking off my dress
I know she's laying on your chest
I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie (Yeah yeah)
I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to meYou might also like5Embed
