Fuckhim Lyrics [fuckhim "ft letter. Ximena Sariñana]

[Verse 1: Girl Ultra]
I see you again, lying on the bed
Another weekend crying for him
More than ten, you don't answer calls
You thought it was him, but that didn't paint well
You always took care of the line, you didn't recognize yourself
You didn't see your friends, "Stay by my side," he told you
You gave your energy, it no longer corresponded to you
Two, three times he did it, it's time to let him go
[Chorus: Girl Ultra & Ximena Sariñana]
Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you look alone and without sleep
Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you look with that top and those jeans

[Verse 2: Ximena Sariñana]
Nobody who is worth it
That way of wanting has a very high price
It is hard for you to forget it
But you know well that tomorrow night
You are not going to be you, you will not be you
The one who sleeps with him

[Chorus: Girl Ultra & Ximena Sariñana]
Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you look alone and without sleep
Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you look at loves in Madrid

[Bridge: Girl Ultra & Ximena Sariñana]
Fuck Him, Girl
Fuck Him, Girl
Fuck Him, Girl
Fuck Him, Girl

Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you look alone and without sleep
Fuck Him, Girl, it is not good for you to suffer
If you know, it wasn't for you, girl
So good that you see you dancing that prince song

[Outro: Girl Ultra & Ximena Sariñana]
Fuck Him, Girl
Fuck Him, Girl
