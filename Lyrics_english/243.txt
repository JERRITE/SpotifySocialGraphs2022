If You Wanted To Read This Sorry Itâ€™s Too Late LyricsVerse 1 JZZ
Make a rap it's so easy
Somebody really fell off the cliff it's Chris Breezy
Majid Jordan start actually singing
Kristaps Porzingis doing amazingly
Wii U boy I make a lot of roasts
Steph Curry stop trying to boast
Or I'll turn you into a loaf
Friends get turned on at one point
Look at The Shield's joint
Real chances are a lot different
T-Streets is killin it bitch
Buzzers are meant for
1-2-3 are not meant for the poor
They get 29902 for their sad act
Way better than they deserve because their wack
Sam&Cat best show ever
Make us look like we In the desert
Hook
If you're reading this it's too late yeah right
Drake try to fool us again with More Life

Verse 2 Future Best
Take a vacation
Wayne really needs the dedication
A broke hoe only points Gucci to a rich hoe
Fucking gold boy
Saying he actually had the Minaj
Nigga you'll be lucky enough if you got a massage
Short verses aren't right
But at least this one was actually tight

Hook
If you wanted to read this sorry it's too late yeah right
Drake try to fool us again with More LifeYou might also likeEmbed
