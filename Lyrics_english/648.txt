Damn photo lyrics ["Maldita Photo" letter]

[Intro: tini]
Twenty -four hours seem a century without you
Baby, I don't know who I am
If I'm not with you (oh)
Twenty -four hours and I still (I'm still) without you
Remembering although I have a bad memory
Baby, I don't forget you

[Chorus: Tini]
Another night without you
I don't know what to sleep
Damn photo
That reminds me that there is no one ', Woh
Another day without you
If the sun came out I didn't see it
Broken heart
It hurts so much that I don't even want another
[Verse 1: Manuel Turizo]
What would it be like to see you again?
That does not write you does not mean that I forgot
I kiss the 'I dial' you and me in Buenos Aires
With your accent you talk to me and the air goes
Is that yours with mine combines (Yeah)
I your man and you my mine (aha)
If you continue 'dancing like that I moved to Argentina (ah)
If I knew 'I even became friend' and your neighbor
To know if you are still alone or if with another walk '
I also think about the night, I don't forget when I heard
How the ear told me ': "I love you, che"
I feel that time pauses, you put a brooch
For walking wind your photo, another sees' I transnochered
I think about the night, I don't forget when I heard
How the ear told me ': "I love you, che"
I feel that time pauses, you put a brooch
For walking wind your photo, another sees' I transnochered

[Choir: Tini & Manuel Turizo]
Another night without you (another night without you, baby)
I don't know what to sleep (no)
Damn photo
That reminds me that there is no one ', Woh (Yeah-Yeah)
Another day without you (another day without you)
If the sun came out I didn't see it (if the sun came out I didn't see it)
Broken heart
It hurts so much that I want another (in true 'that I already want another)
You Might Also Like [verse 2: tini]
That one by one your memory 'arrive
That remind me that with you I screwed up
You didn't love me, I already know that
All 'my friend' are hating me
For thinking about you when I should forget you
I take a drink and I just think about calling you
Thinking about you when I should forget you (OH-OH-OH)
Something must be wrong in me if I still want to call you

[Coro: Manuel Turizo & Tini]
Another night without you (another night without you, baby)
I don't know what to sleep (sleep)
I have your photo
Tell me if you also think 'in ourselves' (think' in us)
Another day without you (and another day without you)
If the sun came out I didn't see it (if the sun came out I didn't see it)
Broken heart
It hurts so much that I don't even want another

[Outro: Tini & Manuel Turizo]

Tini, Tini
