The New Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was never demanding, just understanding
He'd hold your hand when the party was ending
He never upset you, never forget you
He's the one to give his life to protect you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you were never lonely
When you had the old me
But now I'm someone new
Let me introduce you to the new me
[Chorus]
He's a little distant, loves a little different
It's like some part of his heart has gone missing
He's a little wiser, a little older
And maybe just a little bit colder
He's the one who knows that it's completely over

[Verse 2]
And I know that you miss him, the way he used to listen
You were just new in love, he was defenceless
And if you could go back, would you treat him so bad?
Knowing that he'd never be the same after all that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were never lonely
When you had the old me
But now I'm someone new
Let me introduce you to the new me

[Chorus]
He's a little distant, loves a little different
It's like some part of his heart has gone missing
He's a little wiser, a little older
And maybe just a little bit colder
He's the one who knows that it's completely over
You might also like[Bridge]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You always had to love yourself, is that what you wanted?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Whenever all my friends ask all I say is

[Chorus]
He's a little distant, loves a little different
It's like some part of his heart has gone missing
He's a little wiser, a little older
And maybe just a little bit colder
He's the one who knows that it's completely over1Embed
