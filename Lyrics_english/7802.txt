Whatâ€™ll She Look Like LyricsWhat'll she look like (luke 2:40,52)
(t.mccloud)

What'll she look like when she
Opens her eyes and sees what she wants to see
Instead of this cold mirror's lies and all the pieces complete
She says with a sigh "i think i'm ready..."
What'll she sound like when she
Opens her mouth and all the phrases sound right
As they fall out and she says "yes" and she's not
Scared of the sound she says she's ready
{will she be soft will she be strong
Will she be ready to be wrong
Will she move too fast or wait too long
Will she look me in the eyes}
What'll it feel like when she
Opens her heart and finds that there just might be
A small missing part and whether with or without me
She has to start getting ready
What'll she look like when she
Opens her eyes will she see just what i see
Will it be a surprise to find that she hasn't changed
Her eyes are just a little wider now and she's getting ready
