Nice to Meet You Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the end when we're saying things we don't mean
Baby, if this road leads to one step from lonely
Promise that you'll remember what I'm sayin' now
If this love doesn't stay around, to keep you up if it all falls down

[Pre-Chorus]
If we go our separate ways

[Chorus]
Promise me that if it all goes wrong and I don't see you
The way I used to see you
Remember that it started off with "Nice to meet you"
If we end this song and I don't treat you
The way I used to treat you
Remember that it started off with "Nice to meet you"
[Hook]
Promise me, promise me that if it all
Promise me, promise me that if it all goes wrong
Promise me, promise me that if it all
Promise me, promise me that

[Verse 2]
In the end when you're finding ways to hate me
And I make you feel crazy, forever callin' me baby
Promise me you'll remember what I'm sayin' now
If this love doesn't stay around, to pick you up if it all falls down

[Pre-Chorus]
If we go, our separate ways

[Chorus]
Promise me that if it all goes wrong and I don't see you
The way I used to see you
Remember that it started off with "Nice to meet you"
If we end this song and I don't treat you
The way I used to treat you
Remember that it started off with "Nice to meet you"

[Hook]
Promise me, promise me that if it all
Promise me, promise me that if it all goes wrong
Promise me, promise me that if it all
Promise me, promise me that if it all goes wrong and I don't see you
If it all goes wrong and I don't see you
If it all goes wrong and I don't see you
Remember that it started off with "Nice to meet you"You might also like1Embed
