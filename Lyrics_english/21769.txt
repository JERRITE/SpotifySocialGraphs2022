Carry You Lyrics[Verse 1: Ruelle]
I know it hurts
It’s hard to breathe sometimes
These nights are long
You’ve lost the will to fight

[Pre-Chorus: Ruelle]
Is anybody out there?
Can you lead me to the light?
Is anybody out there?
Tell me it’ll all be alright
[Chorus: Ruelle]
You are not alone
I’ve been here the whole time
Singing you a song, ooooh
I will carry you
I will carry you

[Verse 2: Fleurie]
I know you can’t remember how to shine
Your heart’s a bird without the wings to fly

[Pre-Chorus: Fleurie]
Is anybody out there?
Can you take this weight of mine?
Is anybody out there?
Can you lead me to the light?

[Chorus: Ruelle]
You are not alone
I’ve been here the whole time
Singing you a song, oooh
I will carry you
I will carry you

[Bridge: Ruelle]
You are not alone
I’ve been here the whole time
You might also like[Chorus: Ruelle & Fleurie]
You are not alone
I’ve been here the whole time
Singing you a song, oooh
I will carry you
I will carry you
Oooh
I will carry you
Is anybody out there?

[Outro: Ruelle]
I know it hurts
It’s hard to breathe sometimes8Embed
