Iâ€™m Getting Over You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found your picture in my wallet
Still got your sweater in my closet
I'll bring 'em by, maybe tonight
And people asking how I'm doing
But every question still has you in
I say I'm fine
And I never think about you
But you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm getting over you, whoa
I'm getting over you, most of the time
If I say it like I mean it
Then maybe I'll believe it
Like it's true
I'm getting over you
[Verse 2]
Been playing the songs you hated
I called the girl I almost dated
She's not the one
But I'm having fun
And I'm better off without you
And I think it's what I want

[Chorus]
I'm getting over you, whoa
I'm getting over you, most of the time
If I say it like I mean it
Then maybe I'll believe it
Like it's true
I'm getting over you
Even if it takes forever
I'll get my shit together
I've been doing so much better
I'm getting over you
I'm getting over you
I'm getting over you, (I'm getting over you) whoa
I'm getting over you, most of the time
If I say it like I mean it
Then maybe I'll believe it
Like it's true
I'm getting over you, (I'm getting over you) whoa
I'm getting over you, most of the time
If I say it like I mean it
Then maybe I'll believe it
Like it's true
I'm getting over you
I'm getting over youYou might also likeEmbed
