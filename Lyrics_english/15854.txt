Simple hearts (remix) Lyrics [letter of "simple hearts" ft. Melendi]

[Verse 1: Fonseca, melendí, both]
I want to tell you that I intend to make mistake
I'm going to tell you something I can't keep
I already tried, I can't take it anymore
I know there is another one who takes care of your heart
To me too but I have lost my reason
I'll tell you

[Pre-Caro: Fonseca, Melendí]
I confess that this never happened to me before
And I confess that I don't want to hurt anyone
But for a long time I was lost in your gaze
I know that you are missing breakfast in bed
[Chorus: Fonseca, Melendí, both]
I want to dance with you until you fall in love
And although we sow our dreams about errors
I promise you, love, love will grow
Because after every winter flowers come
And although it is very soon to make you a promise
I'm going to put all my cards on the table
I promise you, love, love will grow
Love you like this, you don't need explanations

[Post-Coro: Both]
If we are simple hearts
We are simple hearts

[Pre-car: Fonseca]
I confess that this never happened to me before
And I confess that I don't want to hurt anyone
But for a long time I was lost in your gaze
I know that you are missing breakfast in bed

[Chorus: Fonseca, Melendí, both]
I want to dance with you until you fall in love
And although we sow our dreams about errors
I promise you, love, love will grow
Because after every winter flowers come
And although it is very soon to make you a promise
I'm going to put all my cards on the table
I promise you, love, love will grow
Love you like this, you don't need explanations

[Bridge: Melendi]
And it wasn't in vain everything I have expected
I am a simple heart in love
And I have so much to give you here saved

[Chorus: Fonseca, Melendí, both]
I want to dance with you until you fall in love
And although we sow our dreams about errors
I promise you, love, love will grow
Because after every winter flowers come
And although it is very soon to make you a promise
I'm going to put all my cards on the table
I promise you, love, love will grow
Love you like this, you don't need explanations

[Post-Coro: Both]
If we are simple hearts
We are simple hearts
We are simple hearts

[Outro]
If we are simple heartsmbed
