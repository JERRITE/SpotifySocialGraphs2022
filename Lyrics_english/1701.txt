Free Room Lyrics[Intro]
The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies
The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies

[Verse 1]
I-I run out of stuff so I don't know what to do
You-you walk until you find the things you thought you knew (knew-knew)

[Spoken]
It's-It's-It's weird 'cause I was listening to their conversation the other day, he said, "I like this, you don't know me?"
[Chorus]
You don't slow me anymore
The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies
You don't slow me anymore
The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies

[Verse 2]
I run until I find my lungs I thought you had a clue
You walk-you walk until you find the things in me you thought you knew

I run until I find my lungs I thought you had a clue
(The, eyes you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies)
You walk-you walk until you find the things in me you thought you knew
(The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies)

[Spoken 2]
And I don't know you. There's zero judgement. There's a free room

[Chorus]
You don't slow me anymore
The eyes, you'd think you'd shake your thighs
In a room full of fallen hope and tainted skies
You don't slow me anymore

You think you're running away
You think you're getting away (hey-hey-hey)
You think you're running away
You think you're getting away
You think you go high, but
I got your mind on mine
You really running and you get so fast on it
Wishes are common so let you get that far
Lady, you're a star
Darling, lead the way
I'll be down if I leave you and don't find you (whoo!)

You don't slow me anymore
(-I thought you had a clue)
You don't slow me anymore
(-find the things in me you thought you knew)

[Vocalizing: Ravyn Lenae and Appleby]
You think you're running away
You think you're getting away
(-find the things in me you thought you knew)
You think you're running away
You think you're getting away
(-find the things in me you thought you knew)
[Outro: Ravyn Lenae]
You think you running away you think you know you going going, you going3Embed
