Candyman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Living for tomorrow
Lost within a dream
Tryna find the answer to the question
And it seems that love makes the world feel good

[Verse 2]
Singing in the moonlight
Dancing in the rain
Let the sunshine through to lift your spirit once again
Cause love makes the world feel good
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Chasing after rainbows
Somewhere in the sky

[Chorus]
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good

[Verse 3]
Riding on the river
Of hearts that beat as one
This feels like forever and we've only just begun
Cause love makes the world feel good

[Verse 4]
Holding on the memories
Cause smiles are still alive
Looking to the future and there's happiness in sight
Cause love makes the world feel good
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Walking through my past life
Where the days are full of joy

[Chorus]
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
