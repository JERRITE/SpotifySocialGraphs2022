It was not (remix) Lyrics [letter of "was not (remix)" ft. Brray & feid]

[Enter: Feid & Leebrian]
I told you that this was not going to happen to you that night (Remix)
But you joined because I have the trick that you like to fuck
Mommy, see you, we do it and leave
I get in the Mercedes, where are you?
Great 'thought', lower 'mind'
Tell me who I lie here inside what I feel for you
And I don't look for you worshiping me '
I just want money and fame, but I don't delay '
[Pre-Caro: Leebrian]
That I get tired (Sheesh)
In this relaxation no rest
I wonder where she will be
Because I throw him, but I can't get (Yeah)
But calm, that I do a good
Because no dura 'or pa' so much (nope)
And love that does not last not and 'true'
So, tell him that the game already tired me

[Choir: Leebrian & Rauw Alejandro]
And girl, tell your friend to do me chorus
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her
Because if gold oxidizes e 'because it wasn't gold (it wasn't gold)
Like ours, it never was after all (he says)
Tell your friend to do me chorus (OH-OH-OH)
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her (Yeah!)
Because if gold oxidizes it is that it was never gold (OH-OH-OH)
Like ours, it never was after to-do

[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro]
(Rauw)
I think it's' confused (Wuh)
Tell me, mommy, what happened? (Yih)
If the contract very well said it
I always spoke clearly, I failed I had (Yah!)
What do you like so much how I do it
They tell me that on the album you spent swallow '
Because I picho the message
That you wrote drunk later 'of the' Tre '(Huh)
You wrapped yourself, you confused (ha)
You and I do not know 'ex, we just had' sex (Yahoo!)
Ma ', from nothing to you gave you with fighting (Wuh)
To 'your paper' I had to stop (Yih)
I had to cut the communication (ey)
I have to get away

Go and tell your friend to do me chorus
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her
Because if gold oxidizes is that it was never gold
Like us, which was not after all
And girl, tell your friend to do me chorus
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her
Because if gold oxidizes e 'because it wasn't gold
Like ours, it never was after all

[Verse 2: feid]
(Just as it sounds)
You gave your back, you are a ghost
You no longer believe in me, but I believe in karma
You want to forget me and I am tattooed in your soul
What a chimba that night, you and me in the viewpoint of Las Palmas
I liked that in bed it was a murderer
I had 'other baby', but they are replicas
Mix sex with friends, that's wrong
Psychcho gets if not childbirth

[Verse 3: brray]
The 'attempt' is over
But if I say I don't think of you, I lie to you, Yah
You went in feeling, saying goodbye
And begging is not mine, baby, sorry (nah)
Ass of ass' that comfort me
How to continue in your novel libretto (novel)
To ours I already set a candle (Yeah, EH)
But not anyone gives a capella
And for something I was looking for you, Yeah
Since I did not find you
You envied 'when your friend gave her (Sha)
What you started, she and 'the one who ends it
And I told him to send you greeting '
You have to break the friendship because it could not
You were the one who put the shield
I prefer more 'my pride and stay mute
And me in mine, you are still in yours (Sheesh)
[Verse 4: Leebrian & Rauw Alejandro]
And tell your friend who has lost a follower
That nobody gives you more 'movie like this server (eh, yeah)
Can overcome me, but none e 'better
You moved your card, but I'm not a player (mmm-hmm)
I hooked my backpack with my pac that stands out
Tell him to leave if he does not adapt (ah, ah)
I have what I want and what I don't want, I am missing
Ma ', ruler him' that another better than me leaves you (he says)

[Choir: Leebrian & Rauw Alejandro]
Tell your friend to do me chorus (OH-OH-OH)
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her (Yeah!)
Because if gold oxidizes it is that it was never gold (OH-OH-OH)
Like ours, it never was after to-do
And girl, tell your friend to do me chorus
That I wanted her, but that I do not adore her
Because if gold oxidizes e 'because it wasn't gold
Like ours, it never was after all

[Verse 5: Cauty]
(Young Cauty), Hah
For me who is not 'clear
We ate 'a couple of vece', but as corduroy '
I later 'from there more nothing (more nothing)
Where does it take me from? (Ama), leave the drama, which
I will see 'picheo, but continue (ah)
If you want something seriously, I forget (Yeah-Yeah)
This shit was going to happen, I told him
That love 'true' with me are not achieved
That I have enough 'problem' with fame
That you don't have to want to eat in bed
That I only call her when I have her '
When I am drunk at the morning
But it's to talk for a while and smoking Marihua
That does not take it to a chest, that everything goes wrong
Baby, who falls in love and 'because he doesn't know how to play
But that is normal, it will overcome it
