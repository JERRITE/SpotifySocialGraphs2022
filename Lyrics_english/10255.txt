Always Will Lyrics[Verse 1]
You keep telling me
That I'm way too sure
Of you loving me long time
Huh, but I bet you always will
In so many ways
I've rubbed off on you
And you've been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
We're inseparable
'Cause your soul's with mine
And you've been loving me so long
And I bet you always will, ooh ooh
[Chorus]
We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No space is between us
You know, you know (hearts don't lie)
I could stay here inside in this here city
And you go sail clear across the ocean
I bet you always will, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can't take away
And you can't forget (No)
That you've been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
You won't worry, no
'Cause it's evident
That you've been loving me so long
And I bet you always will, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
We could live on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No space is between us
'Cause you know, you know (hearts don't lie)
I could stay here inside in this here city
And you could sail the ocean
I bet you always will (Oh oh)
We could be on separate planets
The Earth or the moon, heart to heart
We're still in tune
And you know, you know (hearts don't lie)
I don't even care if we're not together
'Cause that's the part that never lasts forever
I bet you always will, huh
You might also like[Bridge]
Doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo doo (Do do do)
Doo doo
Will (Oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No space is between us
'Cause you know, you know (hearts don't lie)
I could stay here, reside in this here city
And you could sail the ocean
I bet you always will

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, I bet you always will (Always will)
I bet you always willEmbed
