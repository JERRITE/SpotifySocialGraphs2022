When (Roller Coaster) Lyrics [verse 1]
I remember very well
What we said that time
It was a mistake of the two
How would I want to erase what happened
I know, it was a mistake, a stupid mistake
What happened to us

[Chorus]
When we will stop hating ourselves so much
When our lips will get together
I know we can forgive us one day
And so start again
[Verse 2]
It has not been easy to speak
We hurt each other, we did it without thinking
Let us leave it behind
If we forget it, we can return
I know, it was a mistake, a stupid mistake
What happened to us

[Chorus]
When we will stop hating ourselves so much
When our lips will get together
I know we can forgive us one day
And so start again

[Verse 3]
I know we can forgive ourselves
And when we return, I know everything will change
Only once again we can try
I know we can work
If we leave everything behind

[Chorus]
When we will stop hating ourselves so much
When our lips will get together
I know we can forgive us one day
And so start again
