You are my dream (Radio Edit) Lyrics [lyrics of "You are my dream (Radio Edit version)"]

[Verse 1]
Where do you tell me, wherever you want I am
And you are the only one to move my senses, that's why I love you
And you are my worship, hey you are my sun
Linda little thing your smile transforms me and takes me to heaven

[Pre-car]
I die for your eyes
Would go around the world
And you are the reason for my stories
I thank heaven for being able to love you as I love you
[Chorus]
Dream, you are my dream
Oh that nobody lifted me
And among your dreams I want to fall in love
I'm not your owner, I just want to hug you

[Pre-car]
I die for your eyes
Would go around the world
And you are the reason for my stories
I thank heaven for being able to love you as I love you

[Bridge]
Is that I die for you
You are all I want
I get up among your dreams
And I stay in your memories

Is that I die for you
You are all I want
I get up among your dreams
And I stay in your memories

[Chorus]
Dream, you are my dream
Oh that nobody lifted me
And among your dreams I want to fall in love
I'm not your owner, I just want to hug you

Oh that nobody lifted me
And among your dreams I want to fall in love
I'm not your owner, I just want to hug you
