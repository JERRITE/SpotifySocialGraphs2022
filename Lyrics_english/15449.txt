You make me so good lyrics ["you do me so much well"]

[Verse 1]
Do not touch, danger of death
Oh, don't touch warm and skull
They doubt, they make me go further
See you run, see you ask me more

[Pre-stribe 1]
And if I was born again, I would repeat
And if I came back, it would give you more heat
[Chorus]
You burn me with the tip of your fingers
Your hands make sores on my skin
I open my tongue that is fire
Blood boils, you still don't see it
That you already know what you have when you want
You already know how I am
You already know that I enters the first
Now something better comes out

[Verse 2]
And what heat, I like your hell
Oh what heat!, Take more firewood to the fire that is scorching
Now it is inside me
It makes me sweat, it makes me go back to you

[Pre-stribe 2]
And if I was born again, I would repeat
And if I came back, I would ask for more heat

[Chorus]
You burn me with the tip of your fingers
Your hands make sores on my skin
I open my tongue that is fire
Blood boils, you still don't see it
That you already know what you have when you want
You already know how I am
You already know that I enters the first
Now I get something better

You do to me so well
You do to me so well
You do to me so well

[Bridge]
Teach me to download your zipper
You know where I'm going
You already know that I have passed the border starting a button
That you already know that I ask for more wood
And you ask for more level
You know how to keep the bonfire
You know how my skin already knows

[Chorus 2]
That you burn me with the tip of your fingers
Your hands on my skin
You burn me with your tongue that is fire
Blood boils, you still don't see it
That you already know what you have when you want
You already know how I am
You already know that I enters the first
Now I get something better
[Hook]
You do to me so well
You do to me so well
You do to me so well
You do to me so well
You do to me so well
You do to me so well
