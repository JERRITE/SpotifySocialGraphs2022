Heaven Knows Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's always on my mind
From the time I wake up
'Til I close my eyes
She's everywhere I go
She's all I know

[Verse 2]
Though she's so far away
It's just keeps getting stronger
Everyday, and even now she's gone
I'm still holding on
[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breaking my heart
Don't wanna let her go

[Chorus]
Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find their way
Only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

[Verse 3]
My friends keep telling me
That if you really love her
You've gotta set her free
And if she returns in kind
I'll know she's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breaking my heart
Don't wanna let her go

[Chorus]
Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find their way
Only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows
You might also like[Bridge]
Why I live in despair?
'Cause while awake or dreaming
I know she's never there
And all the time I act so brave
I'm shaking inside
Why does it hurt me so...

[Chorus]
Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find their way
Only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

[Outro]
Heaven knows
