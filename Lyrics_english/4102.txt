I hope Lyrics [letter from "hope"]

[Chorus: Bryant Myers & De la Ghetto]
Hopefully
That you suffer forever and never stop crying
That you fall in love and that it goes wrong
And that you wake up alone in a place that they cannot find
I hope Baby, hopefully
That the man you love you and more na '
I hope you call me again
I hope your life does not follow this rule
[Verse 1: Bryant Myers]
With you I ran fine
Everyone chooses their destiny
If you are not going to be put pa 'me
Go to hell and follow your way
You're going to regret it, I warn you
You left my heart open
I sleep asleep and sleep awake
Because of you I'm emptied like a desert
So many disappointments
You failed me on so many occasions
I forget when you asked me to forgive you
Lie love, condoms love
I was never going to imagine
Like you and I were going to end
But normal
To'as the stories have the beginning and final, baby
Now you are happy, you say you are normal
You're going to regret when you feel bad
When you need someone to love you
I know you will come, but I'm not going to be

[Verse 2: Almighty]
Baby hopefully and that you punch you without a strike
That your family treats you how your mai treats me '
That when you ask God for happiness
I tell you that there is no, that he sent me and said "bye"
Send me an angel, I'm a robot, heartless
I live in Futurama and I am Bender
Today I want to smoke, today I want to turn on
I want to forget, mix the drinks, bartender
That I do want another whore to depend
Unless you have green eyes
I prefer to be alone, now I like the cold
Baby I moved pa'l polo, I don't want your heat anymore
I no longer want to make the same mistake
Hopefully when they put it to you, they put without love
(Almighty!)

Hopefully
That you suffer forever and never stop crying
That you fall in love and that it goes wrong
And that you wake up alone in a place that they cannot find
I hope Baby, hopefully
That the man you love you and more na '
Hopefully one day you call me again
I hope your life does not follow this rule

[Verse 3: Darell]
I hope I never forgive you and you fall on you to the curses
I hope that bastard betrayed you and that you never fulfill your illusions
I hope the days of your life are shortened by you
I hope that the farewell day does not arrive and a lost bullet kill you
My heart is full 'and hate
That for you I am suffering, that is obvious
Hopefully the one who took pa 'boyfriend tomorrow kill him
And you cry in a wake
Forgetting you is already mandatory
Go away with to 'your demons
I hope they get into a asylum
And that you stay crazy without your marriage
From me, what can you expect?
I was always for you, you hit me, how did you forget
Baby, what was to be loyal
You paid treason and that's why nobody will love you
I wish you going very badly
The day you return is a special day
That day you are going to pay all evil
And I will be happy, hijue'put, I'm going to cry
[Verse 4: from the ghetto]
(Geezy!)
I hope they don't know how to put it to you, Baby, like me I put it to you
I hope they don't love you or answer you when you are alone and empty
Don't have a man who warms you in the nights that you feel cold
That when you fall in love do not give you flowers or the good morning
And when you stay alone, baby, don't miss me
You are not going to find a man who does not deceive you
I hope that agony one day accompanies you, huh

[Chorus: Bryant Myers & De la Ghetto]
Hopefully
That you suffer forever and never stop crying
That you fall in love and that it goes wrong
And that you wake up alone in a place that they cannot find
I hope Baby, hopefully
That the man you love you and more na '
Hopefully one day you call me again
I hope your life does not follow this rule
