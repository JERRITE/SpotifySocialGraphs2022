[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin 'over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin ', Yeah
Turn Every Sition Into Heaven, Yeah
OH-OH, you are
My Sunrise on The Darkest Day
Got Me Feelin 'Sub Kind of Way
Make me wanna savor every moment smowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
GOT THE ONLY KEY, Know How To Turn It On
The Way You Nibble On My Ear, The Only Words I Wanna Hear
Baby, Take It Slow SO WE CAN LET Long
[Verse 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Oh! You, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I'm approaching and I'm putting together the plan
Just thinking about the pulse (OH, Yeah)
Already, I am already liking more than normal
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any hurry

[Choir: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress with kisses slowly
I sign on your labyrinth walls
And make your body a whole manuscript
(Go up, go up, go up
Go up up)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm (Woah, Woah)
That you teach my mouth (Woah, Woah)
Your favorite places (favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me exceed your danger zones (Woah, Woah)
Until you cause your screams (Woah, Woah)
And forgot your last name
You Might Also Like [verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
If I ask you a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you are thinking about it
I've been trying for a while, this is giving and giving it
You know your heart with me makes you bom, bom
You know that baby is looking for my bom, bom
Come, proof of my mouth to see how you know you
I want, I want, I want to see how much love to you can
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

[Pre-Caro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber, Daddy Yankee]
Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are delicate malice
Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
And this beauty is a puzzle
But pa 'assemble it here I have the piece
Hears!

[Choir: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress with kisses slowly
I sign on your labyrinth walls
And make your body a whole manuscript
(Go up, go up, go up
Go up up)
[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm (Woah, Woah)
That you teach my mouth (Woah, Woah)
Your favorite places (favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me exceed your danger zones (Woah, Woah)
Until you cause your screams (Woah, Woah)
And forgot your last name

[Bridge: Luis Fonsi]
Slowly
This is How we do it down in Puerto Rico
I Just Wanna Hear You Screaming, "Oh, blessed!"
I Can Move Forever when I am with you
Báila it!

[Outro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, Favorite, Baby)
Passy step, soft soft
We are going to stick a little bit
Until your screams (Fonsi)
And forgot your last name (D.Y.)
