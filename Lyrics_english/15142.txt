I Burn Lyrics[Verse 1: Casey Lee Williams]
Come at me and you'll see
I'm more than meets the eye
You think that you'll break me
You're gonna find in time

[Pre-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
You're standing too close to a flame that's burning
Hotter than the sun in the middle of July
Sending out your army, but you still can't win
Listen up, silly boy, 'cause I'm gonna tell you why
[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I burn!
Can't hold me now
And you're not stopping me
I burn!
Swing all you want
Like a fever, I will take you down

[Verse 2: Casey Lee Williams]
Reign supreme? In your dreams
You’ll never make me bow
Kick my ass? I'm world-class
And Super Saiyan now

[Pre-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
You’re starting up a fight that you just can’t finish
Watch the little hearts while they scrape you off the floor
Bringing out your rockets? Well, shoot 'em up, baby
High as you can go, but I’m the one who’s gonna soar

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I burn!
Can't hold me now
And you're not stopping me
I burn!
Swing all you want
Like a fever, I will take you down

It doesn’t have to be this way
Let’s kiss and make up, then you’ll learn
You can fight your life away
I get what I want, so don’t bother and just watch me burn
[Verse 3: Lamar Hall]
Hotter than the sun, feel my fire
Pyromaniac, my desire
Thought that you could see the truth
'Til I just burned down the booth
Human Torch, can’t mess with me
Johnny Blaze: Suspect B
Scorch 'em quick, lightning fast
Melt them britches down to ash
Gasoline, kerosene
Strike a match, ignite the scene
Things will never be the same
Feel the fury of my flame
Beg for mercy, it won’t help
Embrace the ending you were dealt
Seems you chumps will never learn
Now sit back and watch me burn

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I burn!
Can't hold me now
And you're not stopping me
I burn!
Swing all you want
Like a fever, I will take you down
[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I burn!
Can't hold me now
And you're not stopping me
I burn!
Swing all you want
Like a fever, I will take you down7Embed
