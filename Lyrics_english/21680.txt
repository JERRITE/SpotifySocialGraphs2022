Window Display LyricsI couldn't tell you the way of the world
Blindfold your eyes
And acquaint with a handshake
You lie for the winter
Sleep with the sun
Lost yourself crossing the oceans between old and young

Left all alone in your window display
You tried to look nice but you scared all the people away
And I won't be taking you home
In spite all the discount you offered me so long ago
Left all alone in your window display
You tried to look nice but you scared all the people away
And I won't be taking you home
Inspite of the discount you offered me so long ago

Cos I formed the basis
For most of your work
Crystallised paints cause a line through my centre
The picture's disected
Cut into four
My rose has been floating in a basket down stream evermore

Left all alone in your window display
You tried to look nice but you scared all the people away
And I won't be taking you home
In spite all the discount you offered me so long ago

Left all alone in your window display
You tried to look nice but you scared all the people away
And I won't be taking you home
I wrote you a letter you know that was so long agoYou might also likeEmbed
