If they leave us lyrics [letter from "if they leave us"] 

 [Verse] 
 If they let us 
 We are going to love each other a lifetime 
 If they let us 
 We are going to live in a new world 
 I think we can see the new dawn of a new day 
 I think you and me 
 We can still be happy 
 [Chorus] 
 If they let us 
 We look for a corner near the sky 
 If they let us 
 We will do with the clouds velvet 
 And there, the two together, the close of God, will be what we dream 
 If they let us 
 I carry you from the heart and there we leave 

 If they let us 
 We look for a corner near the sky 
 If they let us 
 We will do with the clouds velvet 
 And there, the two together, the close of God, will be what we dream 
 If they let us 
 I carry you from the heart and there we leave 
 If they let us 
 Of everything else we forget 

 [Outro]
