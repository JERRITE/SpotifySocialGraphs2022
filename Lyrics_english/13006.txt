Safeword LyricsYou should know, you should know, you should know
You should know by now
What they say, what they say, what they say
When you're not around
And a little girl should be careful
But who's gonna make her?
When those boys start playing too rough
Well who's gonna save her?
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
And it's a dull, dull world
Where you need to manufacture some action
She'll take you home, tie you up, and slap ya
Without even askin'
And all the clamps and whips in Los Angeles
Couldn't faze her
So if you really wanna see her in pain
Just wait until later

Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword

And if everything could come to a stop
Just from something she said
I thought the whole point was you were living on the edge
So when those sounds start to drift down the halls
And start to freak out the neighbors
Remember that it's good, clean, fun
Just wholesome delinquent behavior
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
