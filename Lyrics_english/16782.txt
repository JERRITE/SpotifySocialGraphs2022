Search for the Hero LyricsSometimes the river flows but nothing breathes
A train arrives but never leaves
It's a shame
Oh life
Like love that walks out of the door
Of being rich or being poor
Such a shame
But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make you feel at least alive
And that's why you should keep on aiming high
Just seek yourself and you will shine
You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

In this life, long and hard though it may seem
Live it as you'd live a dream
Aim so high
Just keep the flame of truth burning bright
The missing treasure you must find
Because you and only you alone
Can build a bridge across the stream
Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry
Your passport to a feel supreme

You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

You've got to search (search inside yourself)
Deep, deep down inside yourself, yeah
You've got to search (search inside yourself)

You've got to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life
You might also like(Search for the hero inside yourself) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Search for the secrets you hide) Ooh, the secrets you hide
(Search for the hero inside yourself) You'll find a hero
(Until you find the key to your life)

You've got to search (search inside yourself)
You've got to search (search, search, search)Embed
