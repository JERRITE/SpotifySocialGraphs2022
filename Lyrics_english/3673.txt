I Donâ€™t Miss You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear you speaking
Your words they lost their meaning
And I'm so done with dealing
Dealing with you
Feels like you're reaching
For something I ain't seeing
Don't mean to be misleading
Misleading to you

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said we could stay friends
Why'd you believe it?
Being friends is something
Lovers just can't do
When I said maybe one day
I didn't mean it
Well at least right now
I'm telling you the truth
I don't miss you
[Chorus]
When you go
Go your way
And I'll go mine
Let it go
Don't look back
You'll be all right
I don't miss you
Don't miss me too

[Verse 2]
I know your hurting
No easy way word it
You'll find someone who's perfect
Perfect for you
But it just ain't me
Don't mind if you just hate me
Take back this time you're wasting
And spend it on you

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said we could stay friends
Why'd you believe it?
Being friends is something
Lovers just can't do
When I said maybe one day
I didn't mean it
Well at least right now
I'm telling you the truth
I don't miss you
You might also like[Chorus 2]
When you go
Go your way
And I'll go mine
Let it go
Don't look back
You'll be all right
I don't miss you
Don't miss me too
I don't miss you
Don't miss me too

[Post-Chorus]
It's not easy to let go
Of what we had
We lost that feeling
It's over
We can't go back
We could try to work it out
But tell me what's the use in that?
'Cause I don't miss you

[Chorus 2]
When you go
Go your way
And I'll go mine
Let it go
Don't look back
You'll be all right
I don't miss you
Don't miss me too
I don't miss you
Don't miss me too1Embed
