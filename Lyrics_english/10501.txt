Black Ops 2 Lyrics[Intro]
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitches slow 24/7, fast pace critical
Keep on talking all you want
But to my face be physical
Enemies stay close to me
Look at you, now look at me
Baby, you should really pick your battles (Ayo)
[Chorus]
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now

[Verse]
I hate you
You bust, you dumb fuck, out of your mind
So confused
Smooth sails, grinding without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitches slow 24/7, fast pace critical
Keep on talking all you want
But to my face be physical
Enemies stay close to me
Look at you, now look at me
Baby, you should really pick your battles
You might also like[Chorus]
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now
Look at me winnin' now, look at me winnin' now

[Outro]
I'm a ray gun, I'm all that
Busy talking 'bout my shit, but take a look at whatchu got
I'm a ray gun, I'm all that
Busy talking 'bout my shit, but take a look at whatchu gotEmbed
