One Last Try Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I had one last try
Hidden somewhere inside
But it's all been spend before
When I reach for it, I can sense it in my hand
When I try to grasp it, it's like sand or water
Through my hopeful fingers

[Chorus]
This just won't hold
Hold
[Verse 2]
There's something so half-full about us
We get so little, but what we get it tastes so much
We're always longing for more
Is this the end of the thread?
The thread that led me to lose my head
Over something that started with wonder

[Chorus]
This just won't hold
Hold, hold
Hold

[Bridge]
And even if a butterfly lives a hundred years
Or the stream of water turns around in the rivers
You and me, we'll still be the same

[Outro]
You and me
You and me
You and me
We'll be the sameYou might also likeEmbed
