TranslationsEspañolРусскийFrançaisEw Lyrics[Verse]
When it's lovely
I believe in anything
What does love mean
When the end is rolling in? (Ooh)
Let it go, let it stay, can we love one another?
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows? (Who knows?)
I said who knows?

[Chorus]
Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
This is your world (This is your world)
This is your world (This is your world)
[Bridge]
Quietly still
In a lie
Oh, goodnight
I don't mind

[Chorus]
Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know (Let you know)You might also like96Embed
