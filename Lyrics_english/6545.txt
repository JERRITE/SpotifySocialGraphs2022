BOOGEYMAN Lyrics[Intro]
You play with me, oh, goddamn
Shut the lights off, Boogeyman
(Oh Lord, jetson made another one)

[Verse 1]
You played with me, that shit was childish
The day before she said that Tory Lanez shot her, I was fuckin' on Megan Thee Stallion
Waited to say that shit on my next album
Hit it the day before too
But I kept it player, I ain't say nothing 'bout it
Had her pretty boy, boyfriend tweeting me, ready to die 'bout the bitch like a coward
I told you niggas don't play, now you gon' have to handle me
I poked the motherfucking bear, I'm a animal
Rock out on you, make you dance like Diana
I'm having hoes that's gon' do what I say, thеy are not gonna argue with me, thеy got manners
They not coming in with that phone, don't do cameras
I ain't in the mood to be taking no pictures
I'm way too smooth, having my way with the bitches
You don't wanna be on my shitlist
I'm havin' bitches on bitches
I'm havin' bitches who Blood, uh-huh
Yeah, I'm having bitches who Crippin'
I ain't tripping nigga, baby, don't bang, uh-huh
Uh-huh, big 40 and a crazy-ass chain
Nigga don't walk up on me with that mask on your face, get your shit blown off nigga, Baby don't play (Baow, baow)
Walk on my shit, this that Baby on Baby, I think I'm the shit you can blame it on bae
I'm ready to blow every time I pull out, you can come and find out, bitch, I stay where I stay (Yeah, yeah)
Whip cold and it came with the skates
Project baby, bitch, I step out the lake
Bitch made nigga, know a hater gon' hate
They ain't fucking with Jonathan mama
[Chorus]
You play with me (Play with me), oh, godamn (Oh, goddamn)
Shut the lights off (Lights off), Boogeyman (Boogeyman)
You play with me (Play with me), oh, goddamn (Oh, goddamn)
Cut the lights off (Lights off), Boogeyman

[Verse 2]
I know these rappin'-ass niggas be hatin' (Uh-huh)
But they can't do shit with me mama
I pulled up two chains and six bracelets (Yeah, yeah)
Play, I'm gone bring the bitch right up out 'em
Yeah, I'm in the whip getting top
I like my bitch from the bottom
You think you could like me, lil' nigga you not
This lil' bitch that I'm with is a model
The first one, you fuck niggas play
I'm gonna give four or six to your next show
And come blow one of you fuck niggas down on the stage
The day you call my bluff, that's the day you gon' lay
I was at Rolling Loud, shuttin' down a whole damn show, tried to make me have a problem with gays
Mixed up my words, made a nigga lose a whole thirty million, now, I'm back and I'ma say what I say
Bitch nigga, you done

[Chorus]
You play with me (Play with me, yeah, yeah), oh, goddamn (Oh, goddamn)
Shut the lights off (Lights off), Boogeyman (Boogeyman)
You play with me (Play with me), oh, goddamn (Oh, goddamn)
Cut the lights off (Lights off), Boogeyman (Boogeyman)

You play with me (Play with me, yeah, yeah), oh, goddamn (Oh, goddamn)
Shut the lights off (Lights off), Boogeyman (Boogeyman)
You play with me (Play with me), oh, goddamn (Oh, goddamn)
Cut the lights off, Boogeyman (Baby)Embed
