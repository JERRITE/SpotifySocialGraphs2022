Heavenâ€™s Little Bastard Lyrics[Intro]
Mama, you look like a rock star
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bbymutha - I'm in labour giving birth today
Hit the trap tomorrow, pussy diamond, call her Lisa Ray
Big bread, "he don't give head" - that's what shawty say
Face red, I was on my period, he ate today
Sour dick, he got her going gay, I'm fucking either way
Smashing bitches off of Twitter, I'on't gotta pay
I don't gotta lay up with these niggas, I got shit to shake
I don't gotta kiki with these bitches, too much bread to make
Soda just to bake
Whip it, flip it, shit, that shit upstate
Master of the bait, make your baby daddy masturbate
I be doing great, I been staying in my fucking lane
You should do the same
Out here looking like a fucking lame
[Hook]
Is there a heaven for a bastard?
I go to church but only if I fuck the pastor
I eat the pussy in the motherfucking pew
Give a fuck 'bout what you do
Fuck that book and fuck you
Only motherfucking God can judge me

Is there a heaven for a bastard?
I go to church but only if I fuck the pastor
I eat the pussy in the motherfucking pew
Give a fuck 'bout what you do
Fuck that book and fuck you
Only motherfucking God can judge me, lil' bitch

[Verse 2]
All black, all eyes on me
Big lips, big dick, make it rain on me
Ain't slept three weeks, cocaine on me
New shoes, Stanley Steemer, ain't a stain on me
Should of never fucked your nigga, fuckin' shame on me
He ain't comin' back and you can put the blame on me
I don't really want him either, I just bought a bag of reefer
I just bought a flight to Europe, never beef about a cheater
My dick bigger nigga, I could never need ya
I need M's in the bank, so I'mma see you when I see ya
Smokin dope in Costa Rica with the coldest Mamacita
I been gettin' rich, I been feelin' like that bitch
Money Mitch, fuck that shit you claim, hoe I love the game
I like hustlin' it make me feel insane, bitches looking strange
I'mma make a change I'mma show these niggas ways can rain
Don't forget my name - bbymutha all lowercase, bitch!
