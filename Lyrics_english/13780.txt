Black eyes Lyricsdime, for whom are those eyes
Blacks, who feel alone, for whom your shyness?
Crying of that that cure the saints, of a bitterness of horror
Tell me, for whom are those eyes
Blacks, who feel alone, for whom your shyness?
Crying of that that cure the saints, of a bitterness of horror

Alone, as in La Aurora Polo
Like a sad lady, on a Sunday without sun
And it is not the fault of love, holy .. only priorities and errors
I know of a place that has intense rivers inside
It is seen and does not fear, say I want to tell you love ... I know of a place that you have, intense rivers inside
He lets himself see and does not fear, saying I want to tell you love

You look like that light, which paints the day, brushes ..
Butterfly, your looks are the smile you have
Don't look anymore, where they give you pain, let them live in you
Feelings, and better moments

Tell me, for whom are those eyes
Blacks, who feel alone, for whom your shyness?
Crying of that that cure the saints, of a bitterness of horror

I know of a place that has intense rivers inside
It is seen and does not fear, say I want to tell you love ... I know of a place that you have, intense rivers inside
He lets himself see and does not fear, saying I want to tell you love

I know from a place .. who loves you, I know from a place ... oh what awaits you
I know from a place ... where the roads cross, I know about a place ... Oh will take care of you forever
I know from a place ... I know about a place that I have, I know about a place ... Oh wonders for you
I know from a place ... one by one is, oh I will give you ..

Lellerere ..

That needs you, I know from a place .. you need it, I know a place .. there is day a day is
I know from a place .. night I will wait for you, I know from a place .. that place
I know from a place .. it's your place .. I know from a place .. yours and mine ay where they sing nightingale
Butterflies fly, I know from a place .. I spring for you, I know from a place .. where I met you
I want to see you, I want to have you forever..You Might Also Likeembed
