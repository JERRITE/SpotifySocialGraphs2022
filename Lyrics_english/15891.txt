Only you (in the front row) Lyricsletra of "only you" ft. Alejandra Guzmántú you give me the things that I want when I least expect it
You give me the air I breathe
You will be what I was looking for so much and I thought it did not exist
You will come stealing my life to melt it with yours

And what will it be of me when in your arms I discover
That you will be the sky that I can never touch
It's impossible, I know, get me up

You give me a blow of energy when I'm without battery
You give me life in an instant
You will be the most beautiful story that never forgets
You will come delivering your life to get mine
And what will be of me when in your kisses I understood
That you will be [you will] the sky that I can never touch
It is impossible and I know
What alone you give me [you give me]
The life I always wanted for me
But it's impossible, I know, forgive me

For thinking only about me
[For thinking alone, for thinking only about me]
For not giving you more than I give you
[For not giving you more than I give you]
For simply loving you
[Don't ask me to do]
What I can not do
If you want, if you can, forget me

You will be [you will] the sky that I can never touch
It is impossible and
What alone you give me [you give me]
The life I always wanted for me
[Life I always wanted]
But it is impossible and
What only you will be

But it's impossible, I know, forgive me
Uuuh ooohh, forgiveameyou mirats Also likembed
