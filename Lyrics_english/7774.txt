Thank God For Ireland LyricsShe will hold you face to face
She will whisper words of praise
And you will never be the same
When she is through
I have loved her all my life
With all my heart and all my might
And I will love her till I die
And that's the truth

She's an old soul, God knows
You can see it in her eyes
There's a fire burning now
She is strong and she is proud
She is brave and she is loud
There is beauty running through her ever true
She's my family, she's my friend
I'll defend her till the end
And I thank God for Ireland
Oh I thank God for you

Through your highs and through your lows
Everywhere your river flows
You'll find trouble, or trouble's finding you
But I love your lion's heart
I love exactly who you are
And when you need me
You know there's nothing I won't do

You're an old soul, Lord knows
You can see it in her eyes
There's a fire burning now

You are strong and you are proud
You are brave and you are loud
There is beauty running through you ever true
You're my family, you're my friend
I'll defend you till the end
And I thank God for Ireland
Oh, I thank God for you
Oh, I thank God for Ireland
And I think God for you
Oh, I thank God for Ireland
And I think God for you
You might also likeYou are strong and you are proud
You are brave and you are loud
There is beauty running through you ever true

Hey!
