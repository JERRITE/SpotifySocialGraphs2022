TranslationEngiley Seca Lyrics [Letter of "Dry Law"]

[Intro: Jhay Cortez & Anuel AA]
Real until death
'Tá tired' of the bad decisione '(oh-oh, oh)
Illusion 'false' and 'bad love' (amore '), but
When you feel good (well), how beautiful it makes me
That's why

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Jhay Cortez]
Today 'tá' leave, pass it with a bastard (bastard)
Put the combi that bought at the mall (the mall)
The color that the sun left (the sun)
The music in high, drinking a lot of alcohol (a lot of alcohol)
With Toa 'La' His' at the disco (Uah)
Dry law is over (uah)
Looking to see who they sin with, yes
Today 'tá' leave, pass it with a bastard (bastard)
Put the combi that bought the mall (the mall)
The color that the sun gave him
The music in high, drinking a lot of alcohol (alcohol)
With Toa 'La' Suya 'at the disco (disco)
Dry law is over
LOOKING TO SEE WHO PECAN
[Verse 1: Jhay Cortez & Anuel AA]
(Jhay Cortez '; Can I follow me'?)
I don't have a bugatti, but I will make him bastard
Can it still 'or not follow me'? Jhayco, the pressure (-co, the pressure)
Vamo 'to get your boyfriend' e the equation
And tell the DJ to put my song (my song)
As Sech, 911
I am the one who breaks you and who sews you (uah)
If you are already 'here, what do you do', then '?
You 'go hard since I have eleven, and (uah)
I haven't seen you (I see)
They speak badly about you, but I don't think (I don't 'think)
Toa 'this' envious' he' brought out 'the de'o (de'o)
And to 'this' envious' I walk them (brr)
Stop it (delay it), pass it (pass it)
Go up the music and leave it (leave it)
If you are wet, I can, navégalo
To 'those dm, pichéalo' (pichéalo ')

[Pre-Caro: Jhay Cortez & Anuel AA]
And vamo 'to the patch
I throw you 'pa' that you cache
E 'from Humacao, that's why H (uah)
You want 'that I heels you, tache (uah)
And pa'l patch
I throw you 'pa' that you cache
I don't think I will write to you '
Without clothes, I said "Diache"
