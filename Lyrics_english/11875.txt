View with me Lyrics [letter of "Vente with me" ft. Juancho Marqués]

[Dollar Selmouni]
I love your look
That way of thinking
Your perfume when passing
That captivates me
Your body is crazy
Waiting for that movement
That takes me and takes me
And elevates me to heaven
I can not anymore
I can't even control myself
When I look at you
When I feel you ...
Let's do it soft, very soft
That nobody finds out that we do evil
Soft good...
[Chorus: Dollar Selmouni]
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby


[Juancho Marqués]
I fill myself, he filled me
He says my voice calms him
Things have plenty
When they don't have a soul
I call her and call me
Keep the flame
Báilame, kiss me
Touch me the palms
When I love my life is good
Turn you in the sand, sing in Havana
In the same frequency vibrate, laugh, cry
Beginning in bed, the end in the Seine
Baby life is good
Save me from me, blessed condemnation
Come with me, Baby
Come with me...

Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Baby
Come with me, watch with me
Come with me, Babyembed
