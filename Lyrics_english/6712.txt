I Canâ€™t Fold Lyrics[Intro]
Tell my life story
Roaming with the pressure shit I might throw it off
I don't know about them woadie I can't fold
I don't know about them woadie I can't fold
Time just fades and my life still cold
Roaming with the pressure shit I might throw it off
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold

[Verse 1: Wifisfuneral]
Look listen I was two pills all in my possession
I ain't with it
Had to trap it out my mama crib
Old story, old shorty
You ain't ever even know me
Little do you know that all you is a phony
I ain't worry bout my worries
Keep me worried now my vision getting blurry
Lost/dark in my slum
But I then died too early
Ok then I fade, ok then I fade
Then I fade, then I fade
If I'm reaching for it
I'll just promise you won't take away
I can feel my chest ache just bait
That I need just feat
Feel the weakness in my knees
Black heart no disease
Just me, Just bleed
I can feel my chest ache just bait
That I need just feat
Feel the weakness in my knees
Black heart no disease
Just me, Just bleed
[Chorus: Wifisfuneral]
Time just fades and my life still cold
Roamin' with depression shit it made me wanna go
38. cocked back now my mental won't explode
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
Time just fades and my life still cold
Roamin' with depression shit it made me wanna go
38. cocked back now my mental won't explode
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
Time just fades and my life still cold
But woadie I can't fold
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold
Time just fades and my life still cold
I don't know about them but woadie I can't fold

[Verse 2: $carecrow]
Young Beelzebub by the pit
Hold a bitch like that bit
We the clique that be rolling too thick
Got that itch from the pain pills
You don't know how pain feel
I'm up with the tranquills
We not in a safe feel
My mouth closed and you squeal
You work jobs while I steal
You high while I stand still
Then float while I look through bodies in the sea
Man I'm looking for reasons
To try and act decent
And stay but I'm leaving
To fill with them demons
My clique filled with heathens
Who get sick of breathing every fucking season
I'm Christ bitch I'm Jesus
I'm bred out of grey
The alpha omega
The lord of decay
I'm the one they gave up on
They left me a stray
Now they breeded a beast and
You fuckboys the prey
Fuck with the clique and you might die today
In the shadows I stay, stay, stay

Blood splatters
[?]
Back of the trunk
I'm swagging
From the victim I was dragging
'Napping the fuckboy yea
Copping thirst from all my enemies
Locked in with FTP
I got the password
And I get the free
Fucked in my memory
Forgot my identity
Lost in the endless sea
Wait now, debree
Has become me relentlessly
Tempting me to move back yea
Now I'm broke with no cash
Got to have tank of gas
Which is emptying fast
Destination ain't my destiny
Trying to shine effortlessly
Check and see
$uicide end up blown up on MTV
Got a bomb strapped to my chest
Fuck every industry, fashion
And both fuck the song
Fuck the drugs
I don't give a fuck
Please let me rest8Embed
