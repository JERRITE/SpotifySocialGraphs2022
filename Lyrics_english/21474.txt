DTM Lyrics [Intro: Gedz]
No no no no
No no no no
The only medicine (only medicine)
No no no
VBS

[Chorus: VBS & GODZ]
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore
[Verse 1: Gedz]
I will not come back among those who are still waiting for manna
Whores would like to have everything for free
I know what value the banknote has
I clench my teeth and fists, because I know perfectly well that life is a fight
Middle corporations
Whenever I throw whistles through the balcony
I will not return to those places anymore
Ziom, I couldn't stand it
Although everything is ok today
I still remember the times when I had less
Then they didn't want to know me
Today they tell me "Siemano"
What is the fuck with you
You must have hay in your head
Scenario like "Fargo"
You have a minus with me just like your balance
Suddenly you want to drink alcohol
You forgot quickly as it was recently

[Chorus: VBS & GODZ]
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore

I don't want to go back under the cage
To those places mentioned
Where they have a mantra here
They want everything for free
(Whores) kill stress
Grass is the only medicine (the only medicine)
They want to eat from one vase
And they didn't want me there once
This jump also makes me a dumpster
On the one hand, blockers, and on the other mainstream
What I have to sacrifice here
I tried to talk to this band here
What she threw me in a swamp
I don't think we can get along too much
Because we differ more than just an ortalion
I don't care much
Friends to embrace (Cash)
They can't get over
And they are fucked up gandzia
I will not come back, I will not go back there
I will not come back, I will not go back there
Where you stand with a cheap brewery after Szmal
I will not return to the block that took me more than he gave me, V

[Chorus: VBS & GODZ]
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore
I stood under the block and stood after Cash (I stood after Cash)
When it was cold and when it rained (when it rained)
I saw life and death (life and death)
I will not go back to those places (no, no, no, no)
I grind this new bread again (this new bread)
I gave the vocals the only medicine (the only medicine)
Clenched fist (clenched fist) - I'm not afraid of anything anymore
