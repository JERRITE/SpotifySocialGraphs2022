Falling in Love (With My Best Friend) LyricsIt's so good
What we got
You and me
We laugh a lot
We're just friends
Simple as that
I don't want it to end
But I'm falling in love
With the best friend I got

[Chorus]
They say you don't really wanna fall in love
You don't really wanna mess this up
You don't really wanna fall in love
Cause falling in love just breaks your heart
(HEY, HEY)
If we kiss
If we touch
All of this
Could get rough
Ain't no thing
Ain't no strings
Ain't no I love you, you love me
We won't get caught up in the stuff that breaks
Oh, no

[Chorus x2]
They say you don't really wanna fall in love
You don't really wanna mess this up
You don't really wanna fall in love
Cause falling in love just breaks your heart
(HEY, HEY)

You don't really wanna fall in love
You don't really wanna mess this up
You don't really wanna fall in love
Cause falling in love just breaks your heart

Falling in love just breaks your heart
Falling in love just broke my heartYou might also likeEmbed
