[Verse 1]
Sippin' piña coladas, ooh, I think I want her
Ooh, I think I want her, ooh, I think I
I think I see me on top of, bikini coming off of
Call her lil mama, lil mama call me papa
No, I ain't her father, but she call me daddy
Hope that's not your daughter, she backseat in the Caddy
Hold up, yeah, baddie, shawty make it nasty
She ain't got a problem, making problems if you ask me
[Chorus]
She sippin' piña coladas, knee deep in the water
Ooh, I think I want her, ooh, I think I want her
She need me, I got her, ooh, you know I got her
(Ooh, you know) I got her, you know, oh
She sippin' piña coladas, knee deep in the water
Ooh, I think I, ooh, I think I want her
(I want her) ayy, yeah, I think I want her
Hold up, now I got her, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
They tryna ride on my wave, yeah
Ain't never been to the beach
Come get your ho out my face, yeah
You need your bitch on a leash
My baby look like a goddess
My baby know she exotic
New girl every day of the week, yeah
What was your name, I forgot it
Forgot it, I forgot it
I'm sorry, I'm just being honest
My baby look like a princess
I call that lil bitch Pocahontas
Yeah, Pocahontas
She ain't gon' leave me, I promise
Straight to the top, here I come
Got this shit poppin' for fun
I ain't gon' stop 'til I'm done
If you see cops better run
I'm rolling deep like a mobster
Smoking that loud marijuana
Yeah, got it all raw, she do not walk
She do not want what you got her, yeah
She want that Gucci, that Prada
Yeah, she need that holy water

She sippin' piña coladas, knee deep in the water
Ooh, I think I, ooh, I think I want her

Hold up, now I got her, yeah, yeah1Embed
