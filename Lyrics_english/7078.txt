Gloom Lyrics[Intro: YUNG MUTT]
Aye
(Battle stations...)

[Verse 1: YUNG MUTT]
They told me, "Heavy is the head that wears the crown"
Which is why I'm always looking down
Looking like I'm always down, ayy
Another year, another clown, another round, another down
Another grave I dug, another stain that's on my Gucci gown
Flip a fucking cross when I cross-dress, Satan in the flesh
Bitch, I never gave a fuck about what they said
Put a hole in a fuckboy head, his face a fucking mess
Yeah, his face look like some mesh, fishnet
He a fucking pussy, but Ruby no rookie
Yet another God is what I fucking could be
If I ever left my room, my fucking tomb
Dreary wishes, bitch, I'm doomed
The King of Gloom
Got imposters on the roster, claim they fostered what I offered
Watch me zoomâ€”man, fuck it
[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
It's that motherfucking Antichrist
Born through immaculate conception, perspective or perception
Sick and tired, here's a lesson
Fuck your god, I'm your god, I'm your false idol
Burned your bible, killed your fucking archangel Saint Michael
It's that devil in disguise, bitch, everybody dies, bitch
Electric chair to fry, switch
Say goodbye, then blow a kiss
Everybody welcome to my heron paradise
All my demons colonize
G-R-E-Y, it's the 5, to the 9
We are them dogs that will bite
Dreams that terrorize your mind at night, I spy, ayy
Loaded nine millimeter, $uicide mind
Slippin' deeper, creepin' out my motherfucking grave
Creature, corpse, $lick and Plague always remain
Praise thy grey, Caesar of these fucking apesYou might also like9Embed
