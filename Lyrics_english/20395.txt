La Danza Lyrics [INTRO: Branco]
She has danced whole 'Europe around for love
So now she turns your club into one crime scene

[CHARGE: GILLI]
I think you can 'and know and I know (and I know)
You can 'dance earth green to life and love (love)
Dance, Dance So Skejss Falling Down (Skejsne Falling Down)
Dance, Mamacita, Dance
(O-Oou-Oh-Wouw-Wouw-Wouw
Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw)
(Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw
Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw)
[Verse 1: Gilli]
She finds everything but can't 'find' home
Do everything, for not 'to lose' himself
Do everything, for not 'to lose' his soul
So much on the heart but none to tell '
In and out of men as they were hotel
The feelings they get closed in '
Know well, times can be tough '
Baby, up 'with head - believe me that' light at the end '
She wants to bar 'dance'-dance '-dance' dance '
For 'forget' all about in night-night night
She wants to bar 'dance'-dance '-dance' dance '
For 'forget' all about in night-night night

[CHARGE: GILLI]
I think you can 'and know and I know (and I know)
You can 'dance earth green to life and love (love)
Dance, Dance So Skejss Falling Down (Skejsne Falling Down)
Dance, Mamacita, Dance
(O-Oou-Oh-Wouw-Wouw-Wouw
Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw)
(Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw
Wouw-wouw-wouw-wouw)

[Verse 2: Branco]
She has danced all night
Waking up, counting Skejs, picking them up at home '
Three children to support 'but mama nothing to tell'
She has seen it whole ', sold it whole'
So it still burns her soul
But she smiles bar 'to them when she sees them at hotel
She has danced whole 'Europe around for love
And u-uh, what did she expect? That 'not' heart with
So now she turns your club into a crime scene
She has danced whole 'Europe around for love
