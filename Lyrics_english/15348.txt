It’s Gettin’ Hectic Lyrics[Verse 1: Guru]
I set if off, by lettin' you know that I can flow
To many beats, similar to fluid, so freely
And you can say I'm gettin' kind of greedy, but so what?
'Cause I'm supplyin' the needy
While some MCs go for therapy, I bury the
Remains of the others 'cause they suck incredibly
Superficial styles only last a little while
But they never hold a candle to the Gang Starr profile
More than just wit and more than just intellect
And more than a gangster 'cause I kill with a mic check
And I'm not the one with the H on his back, meanin' the Herb
I like the funky beats, I like the good herb
Most likely in a blunt, as I roll it real steady
Then I get mentally ready
To play a track from the Heavies and mellow out
'Cause my main objective is to be more effective
[Hook x4]
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild

[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo, when the mic stands free, I then step to the
Point of attack 'cause the track feels good to me
And I intend to break you out of your restraints
'Cause you gain interest in my lines like I'm CitiBank
And thanks to the Brand New Heavies and everyone
Who can dig the movement of the Guru, smooth and
Provin' that I'm the relevant eloquent one
Suckers gettin' whoopings like they're all my sons
Rememberin' rap from the days of its origin
The power of many men descends from my pen
Dissin' the ones wit' the fame and, claimin' they hard
Yo, them I disregard
'Cause they ain't all cracked up to what they should be
Some I call wannabees, and some I call would-be's
And I'm gettin' vexed by the crap they project
They put in on wax and on the record store racks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Guru]
Rearrangin' the script as my words shift gear in a flash
Puttin' cash in a stash, ain't nuttin' funny, money
Much greater gifts I receive, by those who are blessed
And me? I got a treasure chest
By all means, protected at all times
You try to front and you'll pay more than a small fine
I don't brag, about the stuff I did
I simply roll correctly, demolishin' stupid kids
And they're runnin' off with the lip and not accomplishin' zip
I tell 'em wake up, son, 'cause this is it
Peep out the suckers who are fakin'
Flakin' moves on the mic and in life
Strife is what I give 'em 'cause I'm livin' how I should be
And you better move 'cause the groove is like deadly
And no, you ain't all that, and many ain't legit
So I'mma put 'em out, 'fore they get rushed
