All My Friends Are Nobodies Lyrics[Verse 1: Matty]
To all my friends who are just like me
Another cog in the big machine
Another victim of the industry
It just don’t mean nothing to me
To all the lost who have had enough (Hey!)
To everybody that has given up (Hey!)
Life is tough, are you tough enough?
It just don’t mean nothing to me

[Chorus 1: Ali]
Got a belly full of that pesticide
Yeah, ain’t it cool? We were born to die
Halleluja! Chica chica ride
Gonna fool ya with them white lines
[Chorus 2: Matty]
To all my friends who’ve had enough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
To all my friends who’ve had it rough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
We’ll pick you up

[Verse 2: Matty]
To all my friends who are just like me
Another face, another nobody
Lies are cheap, but the truth ain’t free
It just don’t mean nothing to me
To all the ones who aren’t good enough (Hey!)
To everybody that don’t measure up (Hey!)
Life is rough, are you rough enough?
It just don’t mean nothing to me

[Chorus 1: Ali]
Got a belly full of that pesticide
Yeah, ain’t it cool? We were born to die
Halleluja! Chica chica ride
Gonna fool ya with them white lines

[Chorus 2: Matty]
To all my friends who’ve had enough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
To all my friends who’ve had it rough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
We’ll pick you up

[Bridge: Ali]
Smoke 'em if ya got 'em
'Cuz we're not to be forgotten
A broke future don't mean our hearts gotta turn rotten
Our backs tied to a land slide got us crawling
Callin’ out to the lost and the fallen

[Outro: Matty]
To all my friends who’ve had enough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
To all my friends who’ve had enough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
To all my friends who’ve had it rough
If you should fall, we’ll pick you up
We’ll pick you up
We’ll pick you upEmbed
