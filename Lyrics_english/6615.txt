Lightbringer (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fellow armsmen, I ask you
Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
And reclaim what once was mine?
Those cravens backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin, oh
7000 souls, scared and daunted, such a tale of woe
Not too long ago, this village was a golden scene of hope

[Chorus]
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To livе forever
Bring down the dark rеgime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer!
[Verse 2]
Fellow warriors, I ask you
Should my campaign come to an end?
There's way more to avenge
Fifteen million souls
Living in this realm without much hope
Not too long ago, this kingdom was a golden
State of hope, yeah, ah

[Chorus]
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To live forever, yeah
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order

[Outro]
