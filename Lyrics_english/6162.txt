​the idea of you Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don’t know if I’m in love with you
Or the idea of loving you
It’s unclear, I mean I used to feel so sure
But I might just be immature
I've been stuck on you for so long that
It's hard to tell myself I may be wrong
About the way that I feel for you
For so long, I would squeal
Over a single text from you, you, you
[Chorus 1]
'Cause it’s not love
When you don’t talk anymore
And it’s not love
When I never meant something to you

[Verse 2]
So why did I ever catch these stupid feelings?
I knew, when you told me I was cute
That I was dreaming
So now, I'll try and tell myself
My feelings have no meaning
They have no meaning
They have no meaning

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it’s not love
When you don’t talk anymore
And it’s not love
When you make me feel like I'm a bore
And it’s not love
When I was the only one who's waiting
And it’s not love
When there was no chance of you saying
"I love you too"
"I love you too"

And I don’t know if I'm in love with you
Or the idea of loving you
It’s unclear, I mean I used to feel so sure
But I might just be immature
I’ve been so stuck on you for so long
That it's hard to tell myself I may be wrong13Embed
