[Intro]

[Chorus: Dalmata]
I don't know about you for a long time '
Of life send me a signal
I have searched for you on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
And I could not find you, no
Time continues
And I wanting, wanting to see you again
Stirring in my pillow
Leaving in my bedroom the aroma of your skin
[Verse 1: ñejo]
Where will you be '?
That you have been disappearing for some time '
I walked up even in the police barracks
But, they have no mark, trail, no clue
I did this song to see if you appear, Nely made the track
I'm going to guide her on radio, I'm going to make the video
Let's see if you get brought from me, I'm having a ugly
Depressive to 'Barbu'o without bathing, I don't even clean
It has me listening bachata, Romeo songs
But from the old ones, when he sang with adventure
Cutting my veins, thinking about the adventures
Loquera 'that made'
More to'as the notes, to's the guinea pig
For forgetting, or pa 'remember you
I turned on another Krippy, ma '

[Pre-car: ñejo]
Tell me, Mommy, what has happened?
You don't love me anymore, you don't even call me '?
You know I love you, that I never forget you
That I wait for you here, you know where I live
Tell me, Mommy, what has happened?
You don't love me anymore, you don't even call me '?
You know I love you, that I never forget you
That I wait for you here, you know where I live

[Verse 2: Dalmata]
My bed is cold
Since you left, mine cool
I no longer sleep from night or day
Remembering even when you earn me ':
"Go forward and eat me before it cools you '" (OH)
And that makes me bad, bad
I can't endure, I can't forget
I would like to call you, but I don't know your cell phone
Nor do your address to get to look for (ah)

Why so far?
Being able to be so close
Here with me making love
When you decide to return
I will be waiting

Here with me making love
When you decide to return
