Confidence Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, oh
Yeah

Tell me what you feelin'
Wanna know what's on your mind
I know he ain't committed
But we do this all the time, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't tell nobody 'bout this affair
Baby, go and dirty whine it out, thank you, baby
We might not make it to the room from right here
I love it when you tell me what to do, like sit right there
Yeah, I need that

Tie your hands properly
