WHATâ€™S IT GONNA TAKE Lyrics[Verse 1]
What is it gonna take
For me, babe
To get a hold of someone like you?
I'm gonna wait
As long as I have to

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say there's somethin' if it ain't there
I know the way you treat me ain't fair
[Chorus]
Girl, I won't lie, this life is borin', yeah
And without you, it's unimportant (Yes, it is)
I wish somebody woulda told me
How it'd be right now (How it would be)
It's nothing personal, I know it, yeah
I need a shawty who gon' own it (Who gon' own it)
I wish somebody woulda told me
How it'd be right now

[Verse 2]
And this is gonna take
Some time, babe
To get a hold of someone like you, you, you, you
And I'm gonna wait
As long as I have to

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say there's somethin' if it ain't there
I know the way you treat me ain't fair

[Chorus]
Girl, I won't lie, this life is borin', yeah
And without you, it's unimportant (Yes, it is)
I wish somebody woulda told me
How it'd be right now (How it would be)
It's nothing personal, I know it, yeah
I need a shawty who gon' own it (Who gon' own it)
