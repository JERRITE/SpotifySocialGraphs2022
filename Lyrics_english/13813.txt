Love Me Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me because I've said it all
I've got a feeling we must've hit a wall here
And baby boy, please tell me like it is
'Cause you talk love but you never act on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the drive it is alive and, honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it, baby, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em
You don't use them
[Chorus]
You tell me all the time, baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
(All night, come love me right)

[Verse 2]
Help me, I feel I've lost myself
It's just this one thing, we're great everywhere else
Or is it just me? Am I not what you want?
'Cause if that's the case, baby, why lead me on?

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the drive, it is alive and, honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it, baby, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em
You don't use them
(Why won't you?)

[Chorus]
You tell me all the time, baby (Babe)
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy (Say, yeah)
Why won't you realize (Why won't) you gotta love me right, babe
You tell me all the time, baby
(Come on, you're in the zone, I need you here right next to me)
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day (Yeah)
You are starting to drive me crazy
(Come on, get off your phone, I need to feel your body)
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right, babe
You tell me all the time, baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize you gotta love me

And you love me more each day (Come on now, baby)
Yeah, yeah
Why won't you realize (You got to, you got to, my baby)
You gotta love me right, babe
(I want your love on me, love on me, love on me, love on me)
You tell me all the time, baby
(Your love on me, love on me, you love me)
I'm the light in your life
(Your love on me, love on me, you love me)
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right back, babe

[Outro]
You tell me all the time, baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You're starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize
Ooh-ooh, love
Love me
