Freek’n You Lyrics[Intro: DeVante Swing]
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wan—, I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you
I wanna freek you

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feelin' so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
'Cause sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freek'n you is all I need
[Pre-Chorus: Jodeci, K-Ci]
Tonight, I need your body
(I need your body)
Tonight, you got my time
(Girl, whatever you want, I would give it, baby)
Tonight you won't be sorry
(Yeah, ooh wee)
Tonight, you got my mind
(You got my mind, all I wanna do is freek you)

[Chorus: Jodeci, K-Ci]
What must I say
(Oh, tell me)
What must I do
(What must I do)
To show how much
(Oh)
I think about freek'n you
(I think about freek'n you, baby)
What must I say
(Tell me)
What must I do
(Yeah)
To show how much
(Oh)
I think about freek'n you

I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freek
I hear everything you say
Turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you

[Pre-Chorus: Jodeci, JoJo]
Tonight, I need your body
(Tonight, I need your body, baby)
Tonight, you got my time
(Whatever you want, whatever you need)
Tonight, you won't be sorry
(And you won't be sorry, baby, baby, no no no)
Tonight, you got my mind
(Whatever you want, baby, it would be fine, so fine)

[Chorus: Jodeci, JoJo]
What must I say
(Oh oh oh)
What must I do
(What must I do?)
To show how much
(I think about freek'n you)
I think about freek'n you
(I think about freek'n you)
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
[Interlude: DeVante Swing, K-Ci]
Freek out and freek me up and down
DeVante Swing
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down

[Bridge: K-Ci & JoJo]
Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight
Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight

[Chorus: Jodeci, K-Ci]
What must I say
What must I do
(Can I prove my love)
To show how much
(Lickin' you all over your body, body, body, baby baby)
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
