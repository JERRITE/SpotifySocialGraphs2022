Middle finger to them haters LyricsIntro (Scarface 1983)
“Let’s get this straight now, I never fucked anybody over in my life that didn't have it coming to ‘em. All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one. Do you understand?”

[HOOK]
Middle finger to them haters (x 12)

Okey mic check 1 2 12
Am going to the top what is it you gonna do
Wanna battle me take a rendez-vous
All that shit that you say is so overdue
What you know about music that you talking about
What you know about the streets that you talking about
What you know about them real niggas on by block
What you know about them 10 bullets in my Glock
I ain’t planning to change
I ain’t planning to move
I ain’t planning to quit
I ain’t got anything to prove
I ain’t planning to fall
I ain’t looking at ya’ll
Cuz I just came here to spit
I ain’t worried about shit
Am like
[HOOK]

Fuck ya’ll niggas, lame ass niggas
Am going to the top and I don’t see ya’ll niggas

I do it for my city nigga 5 1 4
Music is my drug and I just want more

Am everywhere ya’ll bitches never been before
I’ve been around the world yeah worldwide tour

Music in my veins, success on my mind
I speak to the deaf, and I paint to the blind

Am too different as in one of a kind
Am too far gone for you to leave me behind

My life's a movie but I bled on the script
My swag is on Creatine and all my niggas ripped

Screaming

[HOOK]

What you talking about nigga
What you looking at nigga
What’s your problem my nigga
Wanna start something nigga
You might also likeHuum my words are nasty but my flow is clean
Life's a chess game and am fucking your queen

Am hungry for rap, eating rhymes off a golden plate
Forever young, show me love or show me hate

Am fresher than a gum with a mint flavor
And am Sharper than a mothafucking shaving razor

They say I’ve changed what the fuck ya’ll mean
I been busy working where the fuck ya’ll been

Am one step ahead like a long run for them hatters
My watch is precious and I ain’t got time for them hattersEmbed
