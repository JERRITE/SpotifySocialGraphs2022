BAD PREMONITION Lyrics[Verse 1]
I went looking for an answer
Came back with a couple notes
Got a taste of what I’m after
No forgetting what I saw
Uh huh

[Verse 2]
And I’ll never close my eyes again
Seeing’s believing, take it from me
There’s a big cloud headed straight
For me, full speed
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s a bad premonition and it’s coming true
What to do
Can you just give me a sign
And for once can I be in the right place at the right time

[Chorus]
The right place, in the right place, in the right
In the right place at the right time
For once can I be in the
In the right place, in the right place, in the right
In the right place at the right time

[Verse 3]
Let’s go back to the beginning
Saw the writing on the wall
Got this feeling and it woke me right up
Someone knocking on the door
"Hello"

[Verse 4]
And I didn’t wanna listen then
But you can believe it, take it from me
You’ve got another thing coming straight
For you, told you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It’s a bad premonition and it’s coming true
What to do
Can you just give me a sign
And for once can I be in the right place at the right time

[Chorus]
The right place, in the right place, in the right
In the right place at the right time
For once can I be in the
In the right place, in the right place, in the right
In the right place at the right time

[Bridge]
Help I’m right back in it now
Don’t wake me up til it’s over and done with

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s a bad premonition and it’s coming true
What to do
Can you just give me a sign
And for once can I be in the right place at the right time

[Chorus]
The right place, in the right place, in the right (In the right)
In the right place at the right time
For once can I be
In the right place, in the right place, in the right (In the right place)
In the right place at the right time (In the right)
[Chorus]
Let’s go back to the beginning (Help I’m)
The right place, in the right place, in the right (In the right)
In the right place at the right time (Back in it now)
For once can I be
In the right place, in the right place, in the right (Help I’m)
In the right place at the right time (Back in it now)Embed
