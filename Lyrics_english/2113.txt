Keep It To Myself LyricsHonestly when we speak
Feels like it's behind her back
'Cause if she saw the chemistry
I know that it would hurt her bad | The dominoes would all collapse
She's not the one you call
At night when you feel lonely
We say we're friends, we know we're not

I know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't, I can't help
That I just wanna keep you to myself
It's a rush, it's a problem
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night and we still might
I should keep it to myself
Can you tell? I can't help it
That I just wanna keep you to myself
When I say everything
Everything except the truth
Scared to sit close to you
'Cause I don't trust what I might do

You stay here a bit too long
My heart, it beats unsteady
We say we're friends, we know we're not

I know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't, I can't help
That I just wanna keep you to myself
It's a rush, it's a problem
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night and we still might
I should keep it to myself
Can you tell? I can't help it
That I just wanna keep you to myself

Don't wanna let you go but you gotta know
That I need you, I need you badly
Oh, so tell me why, why you're still with her
When you know that deep down you want me
Don't wanna let you go but you gotta know
That I need you, I need you badly
Oh, so tell me why (tell me why), why you're still with her (still with her)
When you know that deep down you want me
You might also likeI know that I should keep it to myself
But I can't (I can't), I can't help
That I just wanna keep you to myself (myself)
It's a rush (it's a rush), it's a problem
Do you think she knows about us?
Talking all the time, we almost kissed last night and we still might
I should keep it to myself (to myself)
Can you tell (can you tell)? I can't help it
That I just wanna keep you to myself1Embed
