Bella hello Lyrics [text by "Bella ciao"] 

 [Verse 1] 
 One morning I got up 
 O bella hello, beautiful hello, beautiful hello, bye, bye 
 One morning I got up 
 And I found the invasor 

 [Verse 2] 
 Or partisan, take me away 
 O bella hello, beautiful hello, beautiful hello, bye, bye 
 Or partisan, take me away 
 Because I feel like dying 
 [Verse 3] 
 And if I die as a partisan 
 O bella hello, beautiful hello, beautiful hello, bye, bye 
 And if I die as a partisan 
 You have to bury me 

 [Verse 4] 
 And bury up there in the mountains 
 O bella hello, beautiful hello, beautiful hello, bye, bye 
 And bury up there in the mountains 
 Under the shadow of a beautiful flower 

 [Verse 5] 
 All the people who will pass 
 O Bella ciao, beautiful hello, beautiful bye bye bye 
 And the people who will pass 
 They will tell me: "What a handsome fior" 

 [Verse 6] 
 And this is the flower of the partisan 
 O Bella ciao, beautiful hello, beautiful bye bye bye 
 This is the flower of the partisan 
 Died of freedom 

 [Outro] 
 And this is the flower of the partisan 
 Died of freedomyou might alo like14embed
