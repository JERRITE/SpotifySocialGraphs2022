Be Slowly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it something I said to you?
Is it something I said I would never do?
Spinning round in my head
Kiss me, you my friend
Is it something I said to you?

[Verse 2]
I feel so happy today
I do know what, what got out of the way
Spinning round in my head
Kiss me, you my friend
I feel so happy today
Today
[Outro]
Be slowly
Take it in a blow to get back
Be slowly
Take it in a blow to get back
Be slowly
Take it in a blow to get back
Be slowly
Take it in a blow to get backYou might also likeEmbed
