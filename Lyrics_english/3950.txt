â€‹icarus Lyrics[Verse 1]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow, how
When all you know is up, it's hard not to feel like you ain't going down, down

[Verse 2]
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with a smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
So now
[Pre-Chorus]
Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause it all just feels the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruct just to feel, or so it goes

[Verse 3]
One (Thank you so much, guys)
So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying down the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like, shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year. And it's insane that I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.)

So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still hope that they'll hear you out
Just keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand
Where you're standing now
Icarus
No I can't escape this fall

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
'Cause I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
Guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fucked my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name

[Outro]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop that sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
