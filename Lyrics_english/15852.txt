Arroyito Lyrics ["Arroyito" letter]

[Verse 1]
It dawned
And I found that you started a long trip
My heart escaped your luggage
And he stayed was to fill me with memories

[Verse 2]
It dawned
And the old rooster who sang in the window
Today did not sing you did not open the morning
And even the wind was returned because you were not
[Chorus]
You are the Arroyito that bathes my cabin
You are the negative of my soul's photo
You are blessed water that grows in my cultivation
You are that little bit that heats my nest

[Verse 3]
Sunset
And the heart opens his album in silence
An accordion is printed the memories
And also makes a song to return

[Verse 4]
Sunset
And my cabin's clarity is already
I don't feel light in the corners of my soul
Well, I don't have everything you carry inside

[Chorus]
You are the Arroyito that bathes my cabin
You are the negative of my soul's photo
You are blessed water that grows in my cultivation
You are that little bit that heats my nest

[Bridge]
I just want to be the owner of your love
I just want to be the owner of your laughter
To find you and return your heart
And you accompany me for the rest of my life

You are the Arroyito that bathes my cabin
You are the negative of my soul's photo
You are blessed water that grows in my cultivation
You are that little bit that heats my nest

You are the Arroyito that bathes my cabin
You are the negative of my soul's photo
You are blessed water that grows in my cultivation
You are that little bit that warms me the nestembed
