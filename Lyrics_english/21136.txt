The Art of Losing LyricsLast call now I'm outta time
And I don't got no valentine
Singled out, now I stand alone
The underdog in a modern world
Suburbia is hot tonight
But nothing seems to feel alright
I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing
Fit the mold and do what you're told
Get a job and start growing old
9 to 5 can make your dreams come true
But I don't wanna be like you
I'm not cool and I'll never be
I break the rules and I guarantee
I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

You call me a loser
Say I'm just a user
But I'll just keep on moving
Cause that's the art of losing
You might also likeHey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two, fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see, it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

Wahhhooo (It's the art of losing)
Wahhhooo (It's the art of losing)

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America1Embed
