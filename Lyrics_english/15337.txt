Sirens Lyrics[Intro]
Kick it!

[Verse 1: Rome]
I'm not a fan of when it rains
I'm like a phantom or a ghost those days
Another man of his mistakes
Too many cigarettes in my ash tray
Faith... I'm dying for it's taste
No point in trying to buy, what comes with age
Kick it!

[Chorus: Rome]
You gon' hear me singing like a siren
Never shoot us down never silence
Even when the bullies try to fight us
You gon' hear me singing like a siren

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
This is the morphin' of forces
You just sit silent like corpses
While you keep pilin' that horse shit
I sit on islands resortin'
The siren pulls you off courses
Until you crash on the shorses
And if your bitch loved the sources
She can blow like a porpoise
Hahaha that shit be funny
Out for the night but I'm not Kid Cudi
One for the job and one for the money
One for your moms and one for your buddy
Oh good God I feel so gully
Oh good God I feel so sully
Got a good hunch like a munchkin tummy
It's that time of the month I like shit bloody
Fighters need the Heimlich
Wanna hate but I'm too sick
Rhymin' with sublime and shit
So you can just go climb a dick
You might also likeKick it!

[Chorus: Rome]
You gon' hear me singing like a siren
Never shoot us down never silence
Even when the bullies try to fight us
You gon' hear me singing like a siren

[Verse 3: Duddy B]
I can't believe nobody told you we were dangerous
It's like everywhere we go they try to anger us
Try to keep my distance from the mysterious
But they continue to be vicious so now I'm dangerous
I'm going in, going in
Got no time for second guessing
We ain't never looking back
Locked and loaded so they threaten
Got no reason for believing any bullshit accusation
What you see is what you get
Leave no room for complications
Can't believe nobody told you we were dangerous
No-o-o...

[Outro: Rome]
Never shoot us down never silence
Even when the bullies try to fight us
Never shoot us down never silence
Eeeee.... Na, na, na, na...1Embed
