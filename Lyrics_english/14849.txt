Gone (Live From The Foro Sol Autodromo, Mexico City, Mexico, 1997) [Remastered 2021] Lyrics[Intro]
It's going, going
But not gone

[Verse 1]
You get to feel so guilty
You got so much for so little
Then you find that feelin' just won't go away
You are holdin' on to every little thing so tightly
Till there's nothin' left for you anyway
[Chorus]
Goodbye
You can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' down

[Verse 2]
You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You gotta lose yourself along the way
You changed your name
Well, that's okay, it's necessary
'Cause what you leave behind, you don't miss anyway

[Chorus]
Goodbye
You can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' down

[Bridge]
Am I already gone?
Felt that way all along
Closer to you every day
I didn't want it that much anyway
You might also like[Verse 3]
You're takin' steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels
You hurt yourself, you hurt your lover
Now you think you discover
What you thought was freedom was just greed

[Chorus]
Goodnight
No emotional
Goodnight
I'll be up with the sun
Are you still holdin' on?
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' down (Down)
I'm not comin' downEmbed
