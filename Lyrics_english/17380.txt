Long Beach Lyrics[Chorus]
She just want head in the mornin', she just want lay in the day light
She ain't tryna do no fallin', don't want love if it ain't right
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon and make her feel alive
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me
Lately, I been missin' California, I am far from perfect
But you get me, a lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (Want)
I been thinkin' 'bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (Come through)
[Verse 1]
She a whole mood, there ain't nothin' that I won't do
Chillin' at the bar, while she back it up, a good girl
But she actin' up, a good girl but she bad as fuck
She on ten but I'm catchin' up, she sweat me and I gas her up
I be dumb if I pass it up, those eyes said I had to jump
And her mind said I had to
One, two, three, I'm inspired by your energy
Four, five, six, feel your spirit on my finger tips
Seven, eight, nine, thank your mama 'cause you so damn fine
And I don't really want to say goodbye, let me stay the night again

[Chorus]
She just want head in the mornin', she just want lay in the day light
She ain't tryna do no fallin', don't want love if it ain't right
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon and make her feel alive
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me
Lately, I been missin' California, I am far from perfect (California)
But you get me, a lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (Want)
I been thinkin' 'bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (Come through)
Come through (Come through)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Hit me up and I'll be on the way
Scoop you up and grab you by the waist
Take you anywhere you wanna go
I'm aware that you just wanna play
I know that we goin' with the flow
Soon I'm 'bout to go and catch a plane
Baby won't you open up the door
Tell me you are happy that I came through
Never had a thang like you, lil' brown girl that can hang like you
Shine so bright in the day like moon light
Makin' that lil' thang shake like you
Love in the back of the whip, should we take it back to the crib?
Shawty like crack, no cap, don't know how to act with the kid
Keepin' it a stack, what it is, what she want?

[Chorus]
She just want head in the mornin', she just want lay in the day light
She ain't tryna do no fallin', don't want love if it ain't right
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon and make her feel alive
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me
Lately, I been missin' California, I am far from perfect (California)
But you get me, a lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (Want)
I been thinkin' 'bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (Come through)
Come through (Come through)
I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me
Lately, I been missin' California, I am far from perfect
But you get me, a lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (Want)
I been thinkin' 'bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (Come through)
Come through (Come through)5Embed
