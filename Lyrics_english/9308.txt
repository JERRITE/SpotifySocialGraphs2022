In Your Letter Lyrics[Intro]
In your letter, ooh, in your letter
In your letter, ooh, in your letter
In your letter, ooh, in your letter
In your letter, ooh, in your letter

[Chorus 1]
In your letter, you said you didn't love me
You said you're gonna leave me
But you could've said it better
Oh, in your letter, you said you couldn't face me
You said you could replace me
But you could've said it better
[Chorus 2]
You could've left him only
For an evening let him be lonely
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride
You could've told him something
And proved to me you don't love him
But you hid behind your future full of lies
Oh, in your letter

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, you could've left him only
For an evening let him be lonely
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride
You could've told him something
And proved to me you don't love him
But you hid behind your future full of lies

[Chorus 1]
Oh, in your letter you said you didn't love me
You said you're gonna leave me
But you could've said it better
Oh, in your letter, you said you couldn't face me
You said you could replace me
But you could've said it better
Oh, in your letter
