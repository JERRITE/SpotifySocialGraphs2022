Iz Rite LyricsCome on, is right, take me to your light
Stream me one more shine, it’s all I know, it’s all I know
Come on, is real, you know how I feel
You give me something here and it’s all I know, it’s all I know

So don’t look down, I won’t let go
You bend my mind, sting my soul
Stars align, clouds set roll away

When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till only love remains
Say it again, say it again, say it again
Come on, is great, take me to your place
You made me worth the wait and I wanna know, I wanna know
Come on, is right, take me to your light
Stream me one more shine, it’s all I know, it’s all I know

So don’t look down, I won’t let go
You burn my mind, sting my soul
Stars align, clouds set roll away

When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till only love remains
Say it again, say it again
When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till only love remains
Say it again, say it again, say it againYou might also likeEmbed
