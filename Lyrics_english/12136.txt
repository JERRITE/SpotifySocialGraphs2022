READY STEADY GO LYRICSREADY STEADY CAN'T HOLD me back
Ready Steady Give Me Good Luck
READY STEADY NEVER LOOK BACK
Let's get Started Ready Steady Go

Going forward to blowing the scenery that blows away
I will not miss the target anymore even if I suffer

You just have to bake a map that you can't rely on
Let's grab it with this palm
I ran through quickly
The pounding of the heartbeat that seems to be turbulent is so noisy
Your voice that resonates
There is no time to stop here Ready Steady Go

Even if you have countless wounds
I won't take it to the soul a little softly
If you meet you over the hill
I just think about what to talk about

I ran through quickly
The pounding of the heartbeat that seems to be turbulent is so noisy
Your voice that resonates
There is no time to stop here
Ready Steady Go

Ready Steady Can't Hold Me Back
Ready Steady Give Me Good Luck
READY STEADY NEVER LOOK BACK
Let's get Started Ready Steady Go

My heart runs under that sky
I can't stop shouting the feeling of spinning
Delivered to you surely a little after
Beyond this road, which is hot and illuminates
Ready Steady Go
