Lift Me Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I came out tonight with good intentions
Said I was only gonna stay for one
But the moment that I get your attention
I lose my head and it all comes undone

[Chorus]
Because there's someone in your bed
It goes straight to my head
Then I lose all my sense
You know it's hard to watch you go
Don't leave me here solo
A few drinks and it makes me do things
Lift me up
[Drop]
Lift me up
Lift me up
Lift me up

[Post-Drop]
When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
Few drinks and it makes me do things

[Verse 2]
I stumble out and pass your old apartment
My heavy head, it took me to your door
Emotions spinning, I can feel it starting
To take control and make me trip once more

[Chorus]
Because there's someone in your bed
It goes straight to my head
Then I lose all my sense
You know it's hard to watch you go
Don't leave me here solo
A few drinks and it makes me do things
All because you lift me up
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
Few drinks and it makes me do things

[Pre-Drop]
Lift me up

[Drop]
When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
Few drinks and it makes me do things
Lift me up

[Post-Drop]
Lift me up
Lift me up
Lift me up

[Outro]
When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
Few drinks and it makes me do things
Lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, lift me up
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, lift me upEmbed
