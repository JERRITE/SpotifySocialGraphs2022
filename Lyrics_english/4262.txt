[Enter: Yan Block]
Dronik on the beat
Oh, and to 'the bad time'

[Verse 1: yan block]
In this of love in true 'that I had on me (eh)
The money, the flowers ', the chocolate' and to 'the bad time' (eh)
I still think about regret 'in my room Acosta'o
All the effort, to 'my heart -ón, do you have Costa'o?
But not e 'to get in face
But e 'I paid it very expensive
I gave you a plane to raise you '
I gave you my heart to hurt him '
I gave you a letter 'pa' that the 'Botara'
I gave you 'pa' that the 'burned'
I gave you the fifty that will never give
I gave you pom to stay
And the fault has' you
Now I have die 'that are not like you (you)
Now I have Die ', Chingan better than you (than you; baby)
Now I have die ', they make more than you, uh, you, uh
Now your friend I eligate me ', uh
Someone yesterday called me
Nor the name read, I knew it was' you

[Verse 2: Jay Wheeler]
You killed the 'excitement'
You left without giving me reason '
On the street it paints you 'of Santa, but yours and' break heart '
Now I have more 'opcione'
Cupid went from vacation '
As Ñengo says, Lie de Lie y Amor de Condone '
I hope and cry 'when I mention'
Your friend tells me that he wants to return, heh
Look what cushone ', if grace' I don't believe in relative '
In your name I turn a pair of Blundte '
My Pai 'told me not to excite me
Now I dedicate myself to write you song '

[Chorus: Jay Wheeler]
And go to the fuck, go pa'l fucking
Go out to hell, go to the fuck, oh
Girl, go to the fuck, go pa'l caajo, oh
Girl, go to hell, go pars
Go out to hell, go to hell, go to the fuck (Yeah)
