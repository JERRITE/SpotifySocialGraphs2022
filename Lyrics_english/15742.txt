I called you Lyricste I called and you no longer wanted to see me
They tell you about me and I know what people are like
That I am a devil and you are perfect
That I get into your bed and you don't realize

Says she is not what I met
The one who liked to make it violent
Mommy you don't come to talk like this
Because I know your eyes never lie
(And they say you love me)
I called you and you didn't want to see me
They tell you about me and I know what people are like
That I am a devil and you are perfect
That I get into your bed and you don't realize

Get in my bed and remove the blankets
Do it in a thousand ways
I don't like to work but I want to spend
Oh all your money, dangerous
Do not be afraid
Little by little we do not take the fire
Papi kissed me on the neck and on your walking boat

I called you and you didn't want to see me
They tell you about me and I know what people are like
That I am a devil and you are perfect
That I get into your bed and you don't realize

Tell her what you like
That I go crazy every morning
I called you and you didn't want to see me
I know what you are looking for
And I'm not so bad and you're not so Christian
They tell you about me and I know what people are like
(And they say you love me)
