STRICTLY OLD SKOOL LyricsI don’t mind when you’re around
To pick me up when I am down
Your head is like a work of art
You’re old school
Strictly old school

Fresh out of game I wanted to behold
I’m running late, I shiver in the cold
Then walk alone to meet you after work
'til rain came down
You’re Dr. Dre, you’re Frida and you’re Kurt
You make the day go by without  the hurt
And all the time you'd say you know the score
Another drink you pour
Oh what you’re waiting for

I don’t mind when you’re around
To pick me up when I am down
Your head is like a work of art
You’re old school
Strictly old school
You’re old school
Strictly old school

All poise and grace, fiasco after dark
Sat down to blazе, go walking in the park
Two lovers watch peoplе passing by
The sun came down

Drove a GTI, taste the magic tree
Watch stars in the sky powder off the key
All the time you'd say you know the score
Another drink you pour
Oh what you’re waiting for

I don’t mind when you’re around
To pick me up when I am down
Your head is like a work of art
You’re old school
You might also likeFrom a place where time forgot
Now you’re the one who calls the shots
When I could never be that cool
You’re old school
(I don’t mind when you’re around)
Strictly old school
(To pick me up when I am down)
You’re old school
(I don’t mind when you’re around)
Strictly old school
(To pick me up when I am-)

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
