Suga Suga Lyrics [Words of "Suga Suga" ft. Doums]

[Verse 1: Doums]
I go to bed at nine o'clock in the after-minuit
A last Kush seal to bring me back to bed
Sleep has zapped me
The fate of a sand seller
At cash or on foot
Pay me in pieces or paper
The Doros, the Wari, the Cash
On the head of the Madre ... in Marine
I will put away, the iNES-CLI know it
Fucked Up is the system that consumes us
It's each their cross, negro fuck and shut up
The chanahapa takes itself in the dark night
Either you are a hunter or you are the prey
If you think it is a hunter, well it's that the bait is
Niggiz, you're locked up
[Refrain: Doums]
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you but my hekeu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you but my hekeu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
You would like you to explain to you, but my le-gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
You would like you to explain to you, but my le-gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed

[Bridge: Frankie J]

You have your nose in the Che-Blan as if life was not speed enough (was not speed enough)
Where are you going on? If it's yours you will not be able to miss the film (you will not be able to miss the film)
If we accelerate it is more by gluttony than by appetite (than by appetite)
History we know it: turn at 200, you are paraplegic (skrrrt)
Today I have the impression that the system is much worse than an enemy (Pow Pow Pow Pow)
I exist through him: Azerty, Azerty, Azerty
Like a virus within the matrix
It's not in my plan to famby me in Maastricht
Paris chews you, you spit out, Paris is magic

[Refrain: Doums]
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you but my hekeu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you but my hekeu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you, but my le-gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my gueu is speed, yeah my gueu is speed
You would like you to explain to you, but my le-gueu is speed (Higher, Higher)
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed
Yeah my Le-Gueu is speed

You Know It's Leather when We Ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing What We do, Watchin 'Screens Gettin' High
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You were when when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes9embed
