So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings (A. G. Cook Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

[Chorus]
I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot you're hurting my feelings
Can't deal

[Verse]
With all the X-rated dreamin'
Back on the coast-to-coast life
You know I live for the hustle
But damn, I miss you tonight
Mmm

[Refrain]
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
And I'm out at a party
They're playing our
