Iâ€™m the one - soundtrack LyricsOh yeah
Woah
Hmm
C'mon
Nobody can sing like me
I can hit any note you give for me
From A to Z, yes, I can
Nobody can dance like me
I can move to the beat you're playin'
Baby, with my feet, yeah, yeah
Nobody can act like me
I can fall to pieces
And make you believe in almost anything
I'm the one
Steppin' out and breakin' all the rules
All alone
I'm gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me, can't you see
That I'm the one?
Don't need anybody now, I'm makin' it on my own
Got a voice of an angel
She can turn every word into a lovely melody
Yes, she can
Girl's got her own groove
Put the music on and watch her
As she does her thing
She can do anything
My girl is a drama queen
Any role you give her
She does perfectly
Oh, can't you see that?
She's the one
She's steppin' out and breakin' all the rules
All alone
She's gonna show everybody what she can do
She's the one
Put you bet on her, can't you see
That she's the one?
She don't need anybody now and she's makin' it on her own
I wanna be the one who everybody notices
I'm steppin' out, steppin' out, alright
I wanna be the one who's always front and center
For the first time in my life
I'm the one
Steppin' out and breakin' all the rules
All alone
I'm gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me, can't you see
That I'm the one?
Don't need anybody now, I'm makin' it on my own
I'm the one
Steppin' out and breakin' all the rules
All alone
I'm gonna show everybody what I can do
I'm the one
Put your bet on me, can't you see
That I'm the one?
Don't need anybody now, I'm makin' it on my own
