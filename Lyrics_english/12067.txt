Inside Of You Lyrics[Chorus 1]
I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over

[Verse 1]
You're 21
I see your eyes
You're barely sober
I hear your voice
I'm calling out
From me to you
I pour a drink
You move in quick
You're moving forward
[Chorus 2]
Then you said, no
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said, no
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you

[Verse 2]
This fragile game
It's like a train, it's headed nowhere
It never stops
And I can't see the exit sign
We're headed north
I see the cliff we're getting closer
(Look out baby)
So don't say that you just wanna run away
Replay all the things that I tried to say
I'm 21 so you're getting off
I'm coming over

[Chorus 2]
Then you said, no
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said, no
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you

I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over

[Chorus 2]
Then you said, no
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said, no
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you

[Bridge]
I know I'm going to fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you[x2]
[Chorus 1]
I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over1Embed
