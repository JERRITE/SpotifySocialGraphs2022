If I Go, Iâ€™m Goin LyricsThis house, she's holding secrets
I got my change behind the bed
In a coffee can I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave
And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I'm goin' shameless
Let my hunger take me there
This house, she's quite the talker
She creaks and moans, she keeps me up
And the photographs know I'm a liar
They just laugh as I burn her down
And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I'm goin' on fire
Let my anger take me there

The shingles, man, they're shaking
The back door's burning through
This old house, she's quite the keeper
Quite the keeper of you

I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I'm goin' crazy
Let my darlin' take me there

If I go, I'm goin' crazy
Let my darlin' take me thereYou might also like2Embed
