Color Esperanza 2020 Lyrics [Lyrics for "Color Esperanza (2020)"]

[Verse 1: Diego Torres, Coti, Farruko]
I know what's in your eyes just looking
That you are tired of walking and walking
And walking always turning in a place

[Verse 2: Carlos Rivera, Pedro Capó, Kany García & Prince Royce]
I know the windows can be opened
Changing the air depends on you
Oh, it will help you
It is worth once again
[Choir: Rubén Blades, Carlos Vives, Leonel García]
Know what you can, want to be
Take away our fears, leave them outside
Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart

[Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
The present is better than the future
Give it soft that there is no trouble
And go ahead, no longer 'mind
And hug 'pa' all my people

[Verse 4: Ivete Sangalo, Ángela Torres, Dilsinho]
É Melhor miss that never embark
Better try to stop trying
And so it will be (and so)
The silent life and will move

[Verse 5: Camila, Reik, Lali & Río Roma, (Camilo)]
I know the impossible can be achieved
That sadness will one day go
And so it will be (Yeah, Yeah, so it will be)
Life changes and changing

[Pre-Caro: Fonseca, Carlos Vives]
You will feel that the soul flies
For singing once again

Painting the face with hope color
Tempt the future with the heart
