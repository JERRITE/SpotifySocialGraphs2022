​ingydar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fragilely, gradually and surrounding
The horse lies naked in the shed
Evergreen anodyne decompounding
Flies draw sugar from his head

[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes are blueberries, video screens, Minneapolis schemes
And the dried flowers from books half-read
The juice of dark cherries cover his chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his jaw like lead
[Chorus]
Everything eats and is eaten
Time is fed

[Verse 2]
Early еvening, the pink ring swallows
The sphеrical marigold terrain
Sleepily, Venus sinks and hollows
The stationed headlight of a plane

[Pre-Chorus]
You are as far from me as memory
With fixtures fracture varyingly
The juice of dark cherries cover my skin
Six years in, no baby

[Chorus]
Everything eats and is eaten

[Verse 3]
Ingydar bares a scar like a meteor
Crystalline amber guilds her cheek
Tambourine of the beech leaves lead her
To the raven playing hide and seek

[Pre-Chorus]
Drying blueberries, figurines
And the angel leans at the head of the bed
The juice of dark cherries cover her chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his smile like lead
You might also like[Chorus]
Everything eats and is eaten, time is fed
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten
Everything eats and is eaten3Embed
