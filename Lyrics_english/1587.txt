Let It Out Lyrics[MR. DAVIDSON]
What's in your soul?
Is your heart so damp and bleak
That you won’t give us a peek of your soul?

[NORA]
Just let it out
There's a voice inside of you
On the edge of coming through
What's it about?
[PROFESSOR HIDGENS]
And I know it's a singular voice, Paul
You've just got to give up your choice

[ENSEMBLE]
Just let it out, let it out, let it out!
Let it out, let it out, let it out!
Just let it out, let it out, let it out!
Let it out, let it out—

[PAUL]
Never!

[PAUL, spoken]
What was that?

[GREENPEACE GIRL, spoken]
You let it out

[PAUL/*INFECTED PAUL*]
Was that a note, *or just a sound?*
*Am I finally coming round to rhyming scheme?*
Oh god!
Just *stop it!* I’m split in two!
Is this me, *or is this you?*
*Am I dead?* I’m coming apart
*At the seams!*
*La da da da da da da da da* - NO!
*No no no no no no no!*

Just let it out, let it out, let it out!
Let it out, let it out, let it out!
Just let it out, let it out, let it out!
Let it out, let it out, let it
[PAUL/*INFECTED PAUL*]
I’ve never been happy
*Wouldn’t that be nice?*
Is this the secret?
*Singing and dancing through life?*
Is my integrity worth anything at all?
*But happiness can’t come before its fall*

Am I crazy?
*Maybe I’ve always been*
Become what I’ve hated?
*Or maybe I never did
It’s awful freeing now*
To share the hate I felt
But what will I let in if I
Let it out?

[ENSEMBLE]
Let it out, let it out, let it out!
[PAUL/*INFECTED PAUL*]
*Am I crazy?* I don't think so

[ENSEMBLE]
Let it out, let it out, let it out!

[*INFECTED PAUL*]
*Maybe I've always been*

[ENSEMBLE]
Just let it out, let it out, let it out!

[PAUL]
God help me out!

[ENSEMBLE]
Let it out, let it out—

[PAUL]
If I let it
Out!

[ENSEMBLE, spoken]
We will not be resisted!

[PAUL, spoken]
I don't like musicals!3Embed
