When You Think Of Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, baby, how you been?
It's nice to see your face again
Strange to see you comin' 'round
When you're the one who put me down
We were such a happy pair
But then another man was there
Forgive me I don't understand
Just what you want from me
As you can see my life's been good
I moved the family out the neighborhood
And all my dreams I've realized
To think you said it was a waste of time
It's never hard to make new friends
When you're making Benjamins
Now did I hear you say again
You're still thinking of me?
[Chorus]
Do you feel like dying?
Do you break down crying?
Do you fall down on your knees?
Don't wanna go on living
Does your world start spinning
When you think of me?

[Verse 2]
All I had was love to bring
But you was on some ol' material thing
Looks like you're still trying to drive them mad
But it's not easy when your credit's bad
I didn't know that I could feel so blue
It took some time but girl I'm over you
Would've gladly gave my life for you
You should have thought the whole thing through
All those nights with your girlfriends
Was just a front for you and him
Y'all was s'posed to leave for Honolulu
Leaving your ass was 'bout the best he could do
Dry your tears now baby it's okay
I'll introduce you to my fianc√©e
Excuse me, baby, say again
You've been thinking of me?
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you feel like dying? (Dying)
Do you break down crying? (Oh)
Do you fall down on your knees? (Did you fall down?)
Don't wanna go on living
Does your world start spinning
When you think of me?

[Bridge]
Do you think of me in waves that pull you under?
From my memory, is there nowhere you can hide?
Do you close your eyes, see my face and wonder
How could a love so strong be nothing but a lie?

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Do you feel like dying?
Do you break down crying?
Do you fall down on your knees?
Don't wanna go on living (Don't wanna go on no more)
Does your world start spinning
When you think of me? (Oh oh oh oh)
Do you feel like dying? (Dying)
Do you break down crying? (Do you break down crying?)
Do you fall down on your knees?
Don't wanna go on living (Don't wanna go on, oh oh)
Does your world start spinning (Did your world stop spinning?)
When you think of me?
[Outro]
When you think of me
When you think of meEmbed
