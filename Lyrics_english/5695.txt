Unsteady Lyrics[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 1]
Mama, come here
Approach, appear
And Daddy, I'm alone
'Cause this house don't feel like home
[Pre-Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go (Hold) Woah
If you love me, don't let go (Hold)

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 2]
Mother, I know
That you're tired of bein' alone
Dad, I know you're tryin'
To fight when ya feel like flyin'

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you love me, don't let go (Hold) Woah
If you love me, don't let go (Hold)

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteadyYou might also like55Embed
