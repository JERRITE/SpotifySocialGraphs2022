Lost in London Lyrics[Intro]
Took the first flight out, I must be cursed, I have no doubt
'Cause my ex, she keep on blowing my line
No more chances, it's the last time

[Verse 1]
Touchdown, off my flight, first time in London yeah
Stressed out, need some time to clear my mind
When I, I see her, standing there looking Parisian
Instantly connections, thought she's from Paris so I
Stepped up, this ain't something that I do
So she fessed up, told me I been watching you
Then she invited me to come and break some rules
She enticed me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And we just got lost somewhere I don't know anyone
She reminds me nothing of you
Vibed for three days, two nights, she got inside my mind
Nothing is déjà vu

[Chorus]
I just got lost in London with a girl who's name I'm wondering
She took me to a place I can't mention
Can we stay here for a while, for a while?
I just got lost in London with a girl who's name I'm wondering
She just wanna love me good
Can I stay here for awhile?

[Verse 2]
Last night out, she took me to her bed, I wasn't ready
Her hair smelled of a field of foreign lilies
And I don't remember the pain I felt before
Just for this moment, I don't feel it anymore
She pushed my legs apart, I didn't fight it
Her lipstick on my thighs, yes, I invite it
I just wanna feel something good
She said, "I'm something good for you"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna get lost somewhere I don't know anyone
And nothing reminds me of you
I wanna get lost in a girl that's so fly, I don't mind feeling
I don't get déjà vu's

I just got lost in London with a girl who's name I'm wondering
She took me to a place I can't mention
Can I stay here for a while, for a while?
I just got lost in London with a girl who's name I'm wondering
She just wanna love me good
Can I stay here for a while, for a while?

[Outro]
I just got lost in London (Yeah)
Her name was London (Oh)
She loves me good
So I'll stay for awhile
(I got lost in London)Embed
