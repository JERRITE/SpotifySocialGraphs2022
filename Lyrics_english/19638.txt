Lock & Key LyricsIn long light of early july
In the summer heat he asked me to be his wife
He said "take my hand for the rest of my life
I'll be at your side"
You and me in the bye and bye

He said long have you been a burden blue
The song keeps blushin ..clue
So let the wind whip the green grass in the dunes
My love for you runs through and through
Forever cannot come too soon
The summer left and came November clouds
Wait all that fall into the ground
Waiting for the sun to come back around
I meant to lift him up not tie him down
I'm lost but once was found

Good times they came and went away
By and by we began to fray
And it was clear to see he had swayed
That first summer seemed so far away
But I'm still here and not afraid

So wind, whip the green grass in the dunes
Forever is burning out of you
My eye and skin still cruise
My love for you goes through and through
He had my hand and then he set it free
Still got my heart hidden away from me
I can't walk away I won't let it be
My love is under lock and key
My love is under lock and key
My love is under lock and keyYou might also likeEmbed
