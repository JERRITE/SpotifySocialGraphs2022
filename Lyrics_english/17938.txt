Eye by eye lyrics you are late, that you are tired
That is one of those days, you feel bad
You arrive and leave
You don't talk to me anymore
You're just saying lies
I know you are not going to work
Again the story that is no signal
That the cell phone died
Stop acting
I know I share you with someone else
I don't care who it is
I know you from head to toe
I am worth shit*
do what you want
I do what I want

You played with fire fire, and I burn you
Thanks for the stabbing
Oh oh oh
You were you who shot, you killed all the love
Thank you
This is your karma
eye by eye, tooth by tooth
As you feel
That the pain burned you, that the pain kisses you

Baby, eye for an eye, tooth tooth
As you feel
That heat cools you, that the heat caught you
As you feel

Baby i'm The King in This Game of Chess
Checkmate, Girl You're A Pretty Mess
You Wanna See Me Mad
Now i'll get you back
Sex with my ex, baby is the best
You know how many times that i’ve ignored
All of The Late Night Phone Calls
Now She wants me back, You Gonna Be Mad
Sex with my ex baby is the best
You might also like give a ____ about him
Bloodshot Eyes, Now I'M Seeing Red
It is like shit
do what you want
I do what I want
You played with fire fire, and I burn you
Thanks for the stabbing
Oh oh oh
You were you who shot, you killed all the love
Thank you
This is your karma
eye by eye, tooth by tooth
As you feel
That the pain burned you, that the pain kisses you

Baby, eye for an eye, tooth tooth
As you feel
That heat cools you, that the heat caught you
As you feel

Breathe
I'm not going to shout
You start it, from here there is no way out
I didn't decide, I'm not going to cry for you
If you don't love me
Oh, Cupid’s Got A Gun Locked and Loaded
Oh, Bunce Back, My Heart Is Bulletproof
Better Get Ready, Buckle Up
Baby this is your karma
You played with fire fire, and I burn you
Thanks for the stabbing
Oh oh oh
You were you who shot, you killed all the love
Thank you
This is your karma
eye by eye, tooth by tooth
As you feel
That the pain burned you, that the pain kisses you

Baby, eye for an eye, tooth tooth
As you feel
That heat cools you, that the heat caught you
How it feels like
