The Lonely Night (Reprise Version) Lyrics[Intro: Mark Lanegan]
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind

[Verse 1: Mark Lanegan, Kris Kristofferson, Both]
From a broken bough
Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down
This house is an empty place
So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It’s always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it’s what fate decides
[Chorus: Kris Kristofferson]
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I’m older

[Refrain: Mark Lanegan & Kris Kristofferson]
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Mark Lanegan, Kris Kristofferson, Both]
And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
Heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
Is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had
See the vanishing act
Into thinnest air
See the stitch in my heart
Has been frayed together
Has been frayed together
So tired of wandering around
And starting over
With a graveyard stare
Graveyard stare
And a one leaf clover
Just the one leaf clover

Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind
I can't escape my mind
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind
I can't escape my mind

[Chorus: Kris Kristofferson]
I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
Once I cried like a clown
And now I’m older

[Refrain: Mark Lanegan & Kris Kristofferson]
Here come the lonely night
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mind
I can't escape my mind
Here come the lonely night
I can’t escape my mindEmbed
