You Make Me Mad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Monday mornin' at the station
Blurry view 'cause it was rainin'
'Til your blue umbrella finally crossed my view
"Don't you dare talk to a stranger"
Said my introvert behavior
On that rainy morning, I decided to

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let go
Angels on my shoulder are convinced to make a move
Leave him alone
Another day goes by where my comfort zone feels fine
[Chorus]
You make me mad and I know it's not your fault
Should've listened to my mom, she warned me 'bout you
You make me mad and I know it's not my fault
Still, I listen to them all, and I care 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Tapped you lightly on the shoulder
Asking if it didn't bother you
To grab a drink tonight, or even two
You said "Thanks, I'm very happy
With a girl outside of my league"
Gently smiled, directly, I regretted to

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let go
Angels on my shoulder are convinced to make a move
Leave him alone
Another day goes by where my comfort zone feels fine

[Chorus]
You make me mad and I know it's not your fault
Should've listened to my mom, she warned me 'bout you
You make me mad and I know it's not my fault
Still, I listen to them all, and I care 'bout you
You might also like[Bridge]
You make me wanna shut up and leave
The floor is burnin' under my feet, yeah
Who am I supposed to believe?
I need to run but can't leave
My heart is pumpin' out of my chest
I'm breathin', but I think I collapse
Nobody's tryin' to help
I just can't help

[Chorus]
You make me mad and I know it's not your fault
Should've listened to my mom, she warned me 'bout you
You make me mad and I know it's not my fault
Still, I listen to them all, and I care 'bout you

[Outro]
Just let go
Angels on my shoulder are convinced to make a move
Leave him alone
Another day goes by where my comfort zone feels fineEmbed
