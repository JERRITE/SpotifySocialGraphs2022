What Iâ€™d Give Lyrics[Verse 1]
What i'd give to bring you flowers
What i'd give to get you alone
What i'd give to bring a smile across your face
What i'd give to take you home
What i'd give to make you coffee
Find out how you like your eggs
Wrapped around you in the morning
A tangled lace of arms and legs

[Chorus]
What i'd give to let you love me
Find out everything that brings you joy
Wake up to your face above me
I'd be that girl and you could be that boy
Find out why that feeling is...
Oh, what i'd give. What i'd give
[Verse 2]
What i'd give to take you dancing
What i'd give to make you mine
If you got questions, i got answers
And my answer's "yes" to you every time
What i'd give for just one minute
What i'd give to count all the ways
If your heart was dark with nothing in it
I'd give you mine and take your place

[Chorus]
What i'd give to let you love me
Find out everything that brings you joy
Wake up to your face above me
I'd be that girl and you could be that boy
Find out why that feelin is...
Oh, what i'd give. What i'd giveYou might also likeEmbed
