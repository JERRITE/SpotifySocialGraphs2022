Shock Horror Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watching through the house at night
See you on the other side where you, you are
Colour me with your delight
I'm glowing, every part of me and there's...

[Pre-Chorus]
Something that I wanna do, something that I wanna say
When I see you over there, you know I want to breach it
Something that I wanna do, something that I wanna say
I know I'm not the only one
[Chorus]
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention

[Verse 2: JONES]
You've been watching all along
Took too long to put it on me
This one won't leave me alone
But he can give me what i want, so I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
Something that I wanna do, something that I wanna say
When I see you over there, you know I want to breach it
Something that I wanna do, something that I wanna say
I know I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention

[Break]

[Chorus]
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attention
Everybody at the party is looking at you and that is easy
Oh my God, shock horror, she knows how to grab your attentionYou might also likeEmbed
