Perfect Conditions Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're busy in the morning, grab your coffee
So by the afternoon you can save the world
But when you call me for a second, say you love me
I forget that this probably shouldn't work

[Pre-Chorus]
Know we look bad on paper
The timelines of our lives don't add up
But we fell, ready or not
'Cause we wanted this bad enough
[Chorus]
I thought love, at least the kinds that last, exist in
Perfect conditions
(Perfect conditions)
Wrong place, wrong time, made the right decisions
We're broken but we're still in
Perfect condition
Oh, yeah
Perfect condition
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Got no love at first sight, but you can't tell
High school sweethearts isn't on our résumé
Broke my heart a couple times, put me through hell
I wouldn't want you any other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we look bad on paper
The timelines of our lives don't add up
But we fell, ready or not
'Cause we wanted this bad enough

[Chorus]
I thought love, at least the kinds that last, exist in
Perfect conditions
(Perfect conditions)
Wrong place, wrong time, made the right decisions
We're broken but we're still in
Perfect condition
Oh, yeah
Perfect condition
Oh, yeah

Love, at least the kinds that last, exist in
Perfect conditions
Wrong place, wrong time, made the right decision
We're broken but we're still in
Perfect condition, oh

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Perfect condition
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Perfect conditionEmbed
