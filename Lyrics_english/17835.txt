Hold On Wait Lyrics[Intro: Rah Swish]
Ayy, what the fuck is really wrong wit' niggas, man (Are you dumb?)
Niggas really forgot who started this shit or some'
Traphouse Mob
This is a Melo Beat
9 shots in the Ruger, I step on the court they like, "Watch the shooter", hahaha

[Chorus: Rah Swish]
Hop out, slidin' and we gon' hit that, split that, rip that
Cops out, sirens, check where the grip at, ain't wit' the chit-chat
Ain't no hidin', bullets gon' flip that, clip that, sit back
Why they lyin', where is your blick at? Hold on, wait
Hop out, slidin' and we gon' hit that, split that, rip that
Cops out, sirens, check where the grip at, ain't wit' the chit-chat
Ain't no hidin', bullets gon' flip that, clip that, sit back
Why they lyin', where is your blick at? They sellin' [?]
[Verse 1: Curly Savv]
Glizzy on me, likе, gimme the green light
Shoot out the car, еarly, aim for the three stripes
Won't stop till he scream out, layin' on the floor till he bleed out
Call up the opps, like, "Nigga, now we up"
Go get your homie, he got left on the bleachers
We fucked up his face wit' these bullets an' left all the shells on his sneakers
Boy, you a bum, get a feature, you couldn't hang wit me neither
I bought the glizzy, a nina, [?] eather

[Verse 2: Rah Swish]
Boy, you forgot who I am, I put these niggas on, dumb bitch got me fucked up
[?] still ain't get back since we had him runnin', we caught him an' then he got fucked up (Ha)
Send shots out the whip, throw out the blick, brodie got hit but he lucked up
[?] same bitch that you cuffin' be over here gettin' it sucked up
Hopin' that they pick a side with it, hop out and I'm lettin' it fly with it
[?] he got hit in his thigh with it, keep it on you but you could still die with it
Pull up, niggas know I'm outside with it, most of these niggas don't ride with it
[?] get hit in his mom with it, we ain't the same, bitch, my time different

[Chorus: Rah Swish]
Hop out, slidin' and we gon' hit that, split that, rip that
Cops out, sirens, check where the grip at, ain't wit' the chit-chat
Ain't no hidin', bullets gon' flip that, clip that, sit back
Why they lyin', where is your blick at? Hold on, wait
Hop out, slidin' and we gon' hit that, split that, rip that
Cops out, sirens, check where the grip at, ain't wit' the chit-chat
Ain't no hidin', bullets gon' flip that, clip that, sit back
Why they lyin', where is your blick at? They sellin' [?]You might also likeEmbed
