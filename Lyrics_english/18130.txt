America’s Sweetheart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel so alone in a crowded place
Every conversation feels so fake
Everything I touch always seems to break
I get so depressed when I hear your name
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't really give a shit if you stay
I don't really give a shit if you go
I don't really give a shit either way
Either way, I feel alone
I don't really give a shit if you stay
I don't really give a shit if you go
I don't really give a shit either way
Either way, I feel alone
[Post-Chorus]
And here we are, I'm the bad guy
And you're America's sweethеart

[Verse 2]
I won't even lie, if you lеft me here
I wouldn't even cry, not one damn tear
And I'ma tell you something you don't wanna hear
I won't feel good until I disappear
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't really give a shit if you stay
I don't really give a shit if you go
I don't really give a shit either way
Either way, I feel alone (Alone)
I don't really give a shit if you stay
I don't really give a shit if you go
I don't really give a shit either way
Either way, I feel alone

[Post-Chorus]
And here we are, I'm the bad guy
And you're America's sweetheart

Oh-oh-oh
I don't really give a shit if you stay (If you stay)
I don't really give a shit if you go (If you go)
I don't really give a shit either way (Either way)
Either way, I feel alone (Alone)
I just wanna say I feel so ashamed (Ashamed)
Never really thought that you would let me go (Let me go)
Now I gotta wake up in all this pain (All this pain)
Every day, I feel alone

[Post-Chorus]
And here we are, I'm the bad guy
And you're America's sweetheart10Embed
