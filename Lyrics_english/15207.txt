Red Alert (Boss Metal Zone) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to work for Doc Tyrell
It didn't end so well
Been misbehaving since the Tannhäuser Gates
Quit now, you won't regret
But you gotta take that first step
You strike me as the type who honestly appreciates

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic pulses in my veins
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Red alert, Boss Metal Zone
Red alert
[Verse 2]
The greatest living science fiction writer in the world
You're looking at him
Yeah, you'rе looking at him
You'd make a great companion on a fantastic voyage
So what do ya say?
Yеah, what do ya say?

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic pulses in my veins
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Red alert, Boss Metal Zone
Red alert

[Bridge]
(You are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday)

[Verse 3]
You've been grinding nine to five
Mining just to stay alive
How many heartbeats are there left for the record?
Can you pass the Voight-Kampff test
Under emotional stress?
Are you familiar with the Roy Batty method?

[Chorus]
Electromagnetic pulses in my veins
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Red alert, Boss Metal Zone
Red alert
Electromagnetic pulses in my veins
So many tears in the rain
Red alert, Boss Metal Zone
