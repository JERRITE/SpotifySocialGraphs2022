And I keep touring your skin-e-el
Smoking and drinking rosé-é

I am not a devil, but I give you heat
He spends money, she works on the mall (in the mall)

The hamlet controls it (heh); In the wallet, a gun (heh)
When he catches me, he violates me; Matadora (W!)
Kung-Fu, even flying kicks (Wah!)
Natural the boobies, but the tail was made (it turns!)
When I want, you want, we didn't 'go to fire (fire!)
He nakes, puts me a bandage (ey) and I am blind (Yeah)
He started his game, he kisses me since I arrived (Oh!)
Mommy, you are the hard and that, I never deny it

[Verse 5: Farruko]
(Farru!)
You appeared at the worst moment of my life, you rescued me
You relieve me this pain that torments my heart (blep)
You returned the wins', I didn't love; nobody trusted, nobody looked
Until I found you and I fell in love again
You are the angel who took me out that demon
You walked my hatred, I no longer overwhelm
For you I am sober
And if he leaves me, 'I propose marriage

[Verse 6: Daddy Yankee]
Baby, pay me attention (heh), don't forget my step '(heh)
Although tomorrow does not come out and manufacture a case (wuh)
They keep throwing me and I think (Yah)
When I listen to your voice, I remember everything (go up, go up)
And I get those little things again ', mamita, come back (come back)
Tell me dirty to damage my mind
What hurts me these people (hey)
Where are those who said "real until death"?
With me you are always (-To), I want to listen to you more (more)
The nights are short ', Baby, in my intimacy (-dad)
Killing me in your name, mommy, out of necessity
'Toy prisoner, but your fantasy is my freedom
And come back (ey), to get those little things', mamita, come back (go up)
Tell me dirty to damage my mind
What hurts me these people
But I'm still with you because you are "real until death" (dy)

[Chorus: Wisin, Anuel Aa & Daddy Yankee]
Hello
I saw you walking in the dark alone
In this game, you have the ball
I want to eat you complete, alone (Siki-dady, uh!, Uh-yeh)
I want to eat you complete, alone
I never forget the first time I got to eat
And I keep touring your skin-e-el
Smoking and drinking rosé-é
And now that?
