Naked & Lonely (Bonus Track) LyricsIt's such a thoughtless thing
An effort not to bring
Yourself to love
Or to be loved, or want to be in love
Or all of the above

I saw a photograph
Of someone in a laugh
He looks so foreign
To me right now and yet somehow
I think I'm starting to know him
And now that I'm here
Naked and lonely
Through an eyeful of tears
I see how I was the phony

Here in the checkout line
Next to a girl so fine
She heals my burdens with just her eyes
Then swallows me alive
And I'm reborn

Oh what an ugly game
The one that people play
We shoot ourselves full of desperate lies
And then untie the belt and pay the whores

And now that I'm here
Naked and lonely
Through an eyeful of tears
I see how I was the phony

There is a song I wrote
I wrote it long ago
I sang it to you
And then you cried
I sing it time to time with no one in mind
You might also likeThere is no secret to
Being a good recluse
You just neglect all
The ones you love, even yourself
And only live to breathe and be ignored

And now that I'm here
Naked and lonely
Through an eyeful of tears
I see how I was the phony
I see how I was the phonyEmbed
