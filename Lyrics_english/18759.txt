A Room with a View LyricsSitting at the window staring down
Listen to the people shufflin' around and around
Hear the children laughing
Feel the morning breeze
(Feel the morning breeze)
Sunlight warms his skin
The autumn air is taken in
A nearby bird sings its song for him
For him taken

A room with a view
You're looking at him
He's looking through you
A room with a view
Who's fooling who
There's got to be something that he knew
So there he sits and some may wonder
About the sly grin on his face
Yet little do they know
(They don't have a clue)
The boundaries of his wisdom
In the solitude of his kingdom

A room with a view
You're looking at him
He's looking through you
A room with a view
Who's fooling who
There's got to be something that he knewYou might also likeEmbed
