Indigo Puff Lyrics[Verse 1]
Indigo puff
Take me where the sun shines from my mind
Load up the guns
And drive towards the place we left behind

[Chorus]
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Running through my brain
It's in my brain
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
In my heart, in my bones and in my soul
You're the one who keeps me on my own
[Verse 2]
Take it in right
And breathe into your hungry appetite
Open your mind
Now we're higher than the eastern skies

[Chorus]
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Running through my brain
It's in my brain
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
In my heart, in my bones, in my soul
You're the one who keeps me on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the light surrounding me
I'm open now and feeling free
In time I, in time I, in time I...
I see the sound land on my skin
A passion moves me from within
In time I, in time I, in time I...

[Chorus]
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Running through my brain
It's in my brain
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
In my heart, in my bones and in my soul
You're the one who keeps me on my ownYou might also like4Embed
