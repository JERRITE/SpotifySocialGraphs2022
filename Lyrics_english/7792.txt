TranslationsPortuguÃªsSong 6 Lyrics[Intro]
I coated my house all in white
I got my paints, I haven't spend a night
On every inch, your name I wrote, oh

Since you're gone I've been watching paint dry
Since you're gone I've been watching paint dry
Since you're gone I've been watching paint dry

[Verse 1]
The modern office buildings are chasing the sun
And the wind is racing after the day
And everybody's chasing a beauty they don't have
And I'm, woah, I'm, I'm chasing you
[Verse 2]
The raindrops keep falling, searching for a home
My television's gasping for air
And everybody's searching, searching for a reason
But I'm, woah, I'm, searching for you

[Chorus]
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you

[Verse 3]
The militant commuters come waiting for the train
In the longest Bavarian night
And everybody's waiting, waiting for the sunrise
And I'm, woah, I'm, waiting for you

[Outro]
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of you
We are only dreaming and I'm dreaming only of youYou might also like3Embed
