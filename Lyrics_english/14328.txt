Just a Boy Lyrics[Intro]
You're just a boy, baby, what did I expect?
Ain't got no fuckin' respect? Oh, no, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you at a party last week (Last week)
Caught you staring at me (At me)
You were tryna keep it lowkey (Lowkey)
I thought it was kinda sweet (Kinda sweet)
Then I got to know you, saw the games you were playing
'Cause the things you were doin'
Didn't match with what you're sayin'
Oh, no, no, oh, no
Don't know how you did it, got me in a situation
Guess you're good at hiding ulterior motivation
Oh, no, oh, no
[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you're disposable
I would rather be alone
Than have to deal with you one more time (One more time)
And I know that you think you know
What I'm thinking, but you don't
Think I'm trippin' 'bout you, I'm fine

[Chorus]
You're just a boy, baby, what did I expect?
Ain't got no fuckin' respect, oh, no, yeah
Trust me, boy, I'm the best you'll ever get
Aren't you sad you ruined it? Oh, no, yeah

[Verse 2]
I hate to be the one to tell you (But)
You're just another one of them dudes (Yeah)
Walking 'round like you're so cool (Think)
Everybody cares what you do
Well let me tell you something, I don't wanna sound bitchy
I can guarantee when I'm gone that you'll miss me
Oh no, oh no
I thought you were different, but I've never been so wrong
Got you figured out, don't know why it took me so long
Oh no, oh no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you're disposable
I would rather be alone
Than have to deal with you one more time (One more time)
And I know that you think you know
What I'm thinking, but you don't
Think I'm trippin' 'bout you, I'm fine (I'm fine, yeah)

[Chorus]
You're just a boy, baby, what did I expect?
Ain't got no fuckin' respect, oh, no, yeah
Trust me, boy, I'm the best you'll ever get
Aren't you sad you ruined it? Oh, no, yeah

[Bridge]
You're just a boy, you're just a boy
You're just a boy, caught you starin' at me
You're just a boy, you were tryna keep it lowkey
You're just a boy, I thought it was kinda sweet
You're just a boy, I need a man, though, need a man, though
Ooh

[Chorus]
You're just a boy, baby, what did I expect?
Ain't got no fuckin' respect, oh, no, yeah
(Ain't go no respect, no)
Trust me, boy, I'm the best you'll ever get
(I'm the best you'll ever get, no)
Aren't you sad you ruined it? Oh, no (Yeah)
[Outro]
Did I expect?
You're just a boy, you're just a boy (A boy)
You're just a boy (You're just a boy)
You're just a boy, you ain't got no respect (A boy)
You're just a boy, but what did I expect? (You're just a boy)2Embed
