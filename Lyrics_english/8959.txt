Life’s Been Good Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Walsh]
I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all

[Chorus: Joe Walsh]
They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far
[Verse 2: Joe Walsh]
My Maserati does 185
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked

[Verse 3: Joe Walsh]
I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
[Chorus: Joe Walsh, Bill Szymczyk & Jody Boyer]
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
Everybody say I'm cool (He's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4: Joe Walsh]
I go to parties sometimes until 4
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door *door closes*
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, I haven't changed
You might also like[Chorus: Joe Walsh, Bill Szymczyk & Jody Boyer]
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
Everybody say, “Oh, yeah” (Oh, yeah!)
I keep on goin', guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Spoken Word: ?]
Uh oh, here comes a flock of wah-wahs!
(Wah-wah, wah-wah...)11Embed
