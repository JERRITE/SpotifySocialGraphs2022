BE SILENT WHEN THE KING IS SPEAKING Lyrics[Intro]
It's like they look at me like I'm some sort of psycho, I fucking hate it. Those looks they gave me. I'm normal just like everybody else. I'm not crazy, so don't look at me like I am, 'cause I'm just like everyone else you see. I just get thoughts of murdering people, that's all. Doesn't make me crazy, though. Shit, I'm normal, you're the one that's crazy

[Verse 1]
Get the fuck out of my way
I am unstable, bitch, I'm not okay
Fighting these demons, I can't
Seem to win, why do you call me insane?
Get the fuck out of my way
I am unstable, bitch, I'm not okay
Fighting these demons, I can't
Seem to win, why do you call me insane?
[Bridge]
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?
Why do you call me insane?

[Verse 2]
Get back, I am not me, I am different
Right now, I feel like a victim
I'm possessed, I see the symptoms
I cannot fight what is within
Reach for the blade
I'm not insane, I just cherish your pain
Shut the fuck up and realize I'm a king
Shut the fuck up and realize I'm a king

[Hook]

Be silent whenever I'm speaking
Be silent whenever I'm speaking
Be silent whenever I'm speaking
Be silent whenever I'm speakingYou might also like5Embed
