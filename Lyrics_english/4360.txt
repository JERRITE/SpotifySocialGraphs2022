And nobody is going to do it like me, no
La Mato de Noche as a hunter
Fronteo to 'time but I swear there is no longer, mai
Nobody like your girl, when you nake
Your skin drives me crazy and snatches me
You Sonsacos
Your fast violent technique be baffles me
And nobody is going to do it like me, no
La Mato de Noche as a hunter
Fronteo to 'time but I swear there is no longer, mai
Nobody like your girl, when you nake
Your skin drives me crazy and snatches me
You Sonsacos
Your fast violent technique be baffles me

I am a direct hunter from the Amazon
Tent Malice
The one that if he catches you does not forgive
And you want to know for a long time
Enter direction, is blowing the right wind, right
Sikiridaidai is called what there is
That no matter how much you border me, in the end I know that you fall
I am your killer all night without excuse and ...
As I like you very much, that's why abuse of me
And I'm going behind you, like a hunter
Ready pa 'starting your prey, your skin will be my reward
I get sick of love when lips don't kiss me
From now on, by profession to be your lover
Do not stop and throw pa'lante
On a single course I am still a vagabon
But when I trial quickly, I sink

And nobody is going to do it like me, no
La Mato de Noche as a hunter
Fronteo to 'time but I swear there is no longer, mai
Nobody like your girl, when you nake
Your skin drives me crazy and snatches me
You Sonsacos
Your fast violent technique be baffles me
You might also like nobody will do it like me, no
La Mato de Noche as a hunter
Fronteo to 'time but I swear there is no longer, mai
Nobody like your girl, when you nake
Your skin drives me crazy and snatches me
You Sonsacos
Your fast violent technique be baffles me

Ready or not
Here I eat
You Can't Hide

Boost me attention to what I tell you
She is the attraction of the entire Corrillo
Behind his heat, for every hunter
She doesn't believe in love, for fear of pain
She is hard, hard
Where does so beauty get, I don't know
But he who sees it

Behind his heat, for every hunter
She doesn't believe in love, for fear of pain
She is hard, hard
Where does so beauty get, I don't know
But it has me crazy
Hello baby, tell me what are you going to do baby
If you want to get lost and not return
Nobody will love you as I do
And you know that I kill anymbed for you
