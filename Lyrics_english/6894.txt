​future diary Lyrics[Verse 1: Powfu]
Wildin'
You the only sun that shines in this town, yeah
Smilin' (Aye)
I don't wanna mess up somehow

[Pre-Chorus: Powfu]
But I'm holdin' you back and everybody sees it
Only got time for me on the weekends (On the weekends)
Life with you is all I ever knew
But I'll leave right now if it's best for you
[Chorus]
In my future diary
I can see us flying free
But you got school and family
You got real shit happening (Happening)
I got shit I'm battling (I'm battling)
Gettin' pulled down like gravity (Gravity)
I just want more time with you (With you)
But it's okay, I'll lie to you (Lie to you)

[Verse 2: Jomie]
'Til it goes on and on to the next thing
I'm too selfish, I can't help it
Stuck in my ways, not in my place
I can't wait 'til I'm covered in velvet
Feed mе fantasies
'Cause it's one long trip down this balcony, uh
Baby, gеt mad at me
What’s the rundown
Enlighten me
Uh, uh, and lie to me
I don't like to hear about the irony
If I had a dime for every casualty
Then I'd be dumb rich, still in agony

[Pre-Chorus: Powfu]
But I'm holdin' you back and everybody sees it
Only got time for me on the weekends (On the weekends)
Life with you is all I ever knew
But I'll leave right now if it's best for you
You might also like[Chorus: Powfu & Jomie]
In my future diary
I can see us flying free
But you got school and family
You got real shit happening

[Verse 3: Powfu, Jomie & Both]
So I'll take fault
Keep it all inside, I'm one big vault
Yeah, I know you got dreams I don't wanna interfere with
Tellin' me you love me but I don't wanna hear it
See I'm not great
At goodbyes, bad in your eyes
This your lullaby
And though if after this
Oh, you get pissed
I'd still put up a fight
For you

[Chorus: Powfu]
In my future diary
I can see us flying free
But you got school and family
You got real shit happening
I got shit I'm battling
Gettin' pulled down like gravity
I just want more time with you
But it's okay, I'll lie to you
[Outro: Powfu & Jomie]
I'm one mistake after another
Don't really care, just hide, take cover
(Gettin' pulled down like gravity)
Everybody sayin' that I'm fine, alI I do is whine
(But it's okay, I'll lie to you)6Embed
