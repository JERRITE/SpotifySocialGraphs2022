To below (remix) lyrics [letter from "to below (remix)" ft. Daddy Yankee]

[Intro: Don Omar & Daddy Yankee]
You tell me, musicologist
D-D-D
D-D-D
WELCOME TO THE REMIX!
D-D-D
The world remix!
So down I'm me
D-D-D
D-D-D
D-D-D (The King)
DO
So down I'm me
Dy, the boss
One, yes, yes
Dj eliel in the house, threate
Da-Ddy Yan—
Eat it
[Verse 1: Don Omar]
The night is pa 'a remix, a mini's torque
A good combi, but that kill tennis
Listening a little 'e arcá, also from Geezy
A couple of women 'pa' kill the beautiful crisis
Don, 'Tá Ready, the most ready dj (' tamo 'ready!)
Tire old school, a little chezina and Eddie
I walk in the bandit, like the voltage
Carita 'e bambino, pégate, wild cat

[Saying: Don Omar & Daddy Yankee]
THE NIGHT IS PA 'UN PHILLIE, A HENNY SHOT
A good album, the music 'e a good dj
That put one of the Cangri, an 'e yandel & wisin
A 'E Tego Calde', also one from Ivy
The night is pa 'wippy, smoking krippy
(I know that is what you wanted)
While I upload it, you have a sippy
That put a Nasty of Chencho and Maldy (the boss; eat on)
And a crazy one that walks with the same note 'e randy (the king)

[Chorus: Don Omar & Daddy Yankee]
So down I'm me (the insurmountable; daddy!)
So down I'm me (leave that false machismo)
So down I'm me (Ubis and be conducted)
So down I'm me
(Pa 'above don't look, you're insignificant)
So down I'm me, oh, oh, uoh (i-don, simple)
So down I'm me, oh, oh, uoh (from the moon)
So down I'm me, oh, oh, uoh
(That's why they call him "He who speaks with his hands"; Eliel!)
So down I'm me, oh, oh, uoh (dy!)

(Daddy! Hey!)
I'm on the BM with my reggaeton full
I take out the bottle in hand through the Sunroof
To down, mommy, you are living it
This is what the street was asking for a long time (accelerates)
It is altered, your body with the candle
We go as you want, Machine Sandunguera
This is street perreo, down without kneers
Putting to the to's those asses and hips, Yeah
(Okay, double time)
Keep hitting you, I'm matting you
Guillá 'Fine and you end up trouble
Women and Vacylon (Oh!)
Alcohol and reggaeton (lubricalo)
I want to see how you model, get on the catwalk (Daddy!)
But watch the bar the house, ma ', with little fabric
Women and Vacylon (Oh!)
Alcohol and reggaeton (abuser)

[Chorus: Don Omar & Daddy Yankee]
So down I'm me (simple, daddy, boss; eat!, Dy)
So down I'm me (the king!; Simple, daddy, world remix)
So down I'm me (the insurmountable)
So down I'm me (take off the middle)
So down I am and ('ta bored?
