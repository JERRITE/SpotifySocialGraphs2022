Empty (Empty) Lyrics [Intro]
My appearance in the mirror
It's empty
Even if you walk alone
Empty distance is too empty
Da Ra dat dat dat dat dat
BABY DON NON WORRY
Breaking from your dream
The morning of reality is empty

[Verse 1]
I'm aware of it again in the morning
It is alarmbell, not you who wake me up
Why is the bed to eat so wide?
I only like it like a huge version.
I am a coward who has no empty shells
The eyes of the sympathy of people around
NO! What a day
Inadvertently before starting the day

[Pre-Chorus]
My appearance in the mirror is as empty
(There is no smile and the expression on the expression)
Even if you walk alone, it's too empty
(It's quiet like my heart)
Da Ra dat dat dat dat dat
Baby Don't Worry
(DA dat dat da Ra)
The morning of the reality that I woke up from your dreams is empty
(My heart is too empty)

[Chorus]
It's over, my
Where are you now
It was a memory, I was happy
Don't forget me. See you again

[Verse 2]
Good days and sad days
Difficult days and happy days
Now it becomes a memory in the time passed by
You and I stay in the past
I think I came back to reality
The reason for life disappears, and the head is complicated
When I open my eyes in the morning, my chest is empty
Feel the emptiness and the same as before you meet you
You might Also Like [Pre-Chorus]
My appearance in the mirror is as empty
(There is no smile and the expression on the expression)
Even if you walk alone, it's too empty
(Quiet like my heart)
Da Ra dat dat dat dat dat
Baby Don't Worry
(DA dat dat da Ra)
The morning of the reality that I woke up from your dreams is empty
(My heart is too empty)

[Chorus]
It's over, my
Where are you now
It was a memory, I was happy
Don't forget me. See you again

[Bridge]
It's still awkward. If you close your eyes,
It will be dull, over time
I don't regret it.
I don't want to see you. I just miss you
I'm afraid of my appearance that is not the same as before
(There is no smile and the expression on the expression)
I'm scared to see myself weak
(It's quiet like my heart)
Even the air around me without you is heavy
(DA Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra Dat)
The morning of reality that I woke up from your dreams
[OUTRO]
It's over (it's over)
Where are you (where are you)
Now we
It was a memory. I was happy (I was happy)
Don't forget (don't forget)
See you again Embed
