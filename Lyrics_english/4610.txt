Don’t Believe Half Lyrics[Intro]
The beginning and at the end
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Ayy

[Verse]
I gave the money to scrub down
It's baptized, my demons is rinsed
They can't decode it speaking, they just see as intent
They was never fuckin' with me on my weakest attempt
Ain't no realness really left, it's only me that's exempt
I catch you slippin', I bring a fact for your opinions
I got some dirty mackin' if you slackin' on your pimpin'
The buzz you had won't even make it past the intermission part
Every good thing endin' like what a wishful start we had
I hear 'em talking, don't believe half
I promised wouldn't think this way again and then I relapsed
I'm probably out the way, but I'm exactly where to be at
The energy where we at and home is where my feet at
The road is what I drive on, the chrome is where the seat at
The static cuttin' close, it only get a nigga feedback
I'm really mindin' my businesses
Time of the essence for the witnesses
The money? I just told you what I did with it
In the wave, getting paid with big penmanship
Nigga, I'm in the knowin' now and I ain't sleeping at all
My only question, why you even involved?
Ain't for the weak at the heart
Don't do no sleeping too often
This ain't for the weak at the heart
You weak at the heart
Ayy
What I get, I deserve, nothin' deferred, I'm too ahead of the curve, word
I had my head fully submerged under the current
They ain't tryna see me flourish though, don't take it personally
I know you hurtin', so it's worth it to me
Been on a murderin' spree
Lettin' that Jag' purr right off the curb
Livin' that lifestyle I write in my words for real
Wrong or right, I show you just how the urgency feel
Clear the room for me, a walk-in emergency drill
I tried to introduce you to it 'fore it all started
Cold game, lost art, drawn line, heart crosses
Still, the Satan on my shoulder never stopped talking
I promise this ain't for the soft-hearted
[Outro]
The beginning and at the end
We carry a big swing, but you know, the sound business is funny
It's not, it's not who's carrying the swing on the die, really, that is the best sound
It's who can keep it up, 'cause—You might also likeEmbed
