Still My Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fall asleep right beside me
I will prop a pillow underneath your head
Be nice or mean to me
And either way I'll safely carry you to bed

[Chorus]
When the sun don't shine
When your tears run dry
When you find another soul
Who sees that light in your eyes
No matter what you're told
You are beautiful
And wherever life will take you in this world
You're still my girl
[Verse 2]
You're the queen, I'll be the jester
I'm a royal fool for her majesty
Let's pretend we'll stay like this forever
Wave your magic wand and make time freeze, please

[Chorus]
When the sun don't shine
When your tears run dry
When you find another soul
Who sees that light in your eyes
No matter what you're told
You are beautiful
And wherever life will take you in this world
You're still my girl

[Bridge]
And I know the day is gonna come like a thief
And steal my baby away from me
Oh, but when it does if you don't feel like leavin'
You can stay

[Chorus]
Till the sun don't shine
Till your tears run dry
Till you find another soul
Who sees what I see in your eyes
Oh, no matter what you're told
You are beautiful
And wherever life will take you in this world
You're still my girl
Oh yeah babyYou might also likeEmbed
