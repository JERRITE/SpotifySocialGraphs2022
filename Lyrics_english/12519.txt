Sunburn Surrender Lyrics[Intro]
You set me, set me, set me on fire

[Verse 1]
You're my vision
Looking to the west I see the daylight
Watch it come to rest in, in the moonrise
I turn to your eyes pretender
My sunburn surrender

[Chorus]
You set me, set me on fire
You set me, set me on fire
Pretender my sunburn surrender
You set me, set me on fire
You set me, set me on fire
Pretender my sunburn surrender
[Verse 2]
In my city, moving through the mess, I try to stay light
Float above the stress, but when I'm not high
You are my upside, you send me
The brightest of memories
I'm not dreaming, that's your silhouette
This moment, fleeting
I'll never forget, I need your fixing
You are eclipsing, pretender
My sunburn surrender

[Chorus]
You set me, set me on fire
You set me, set me on fire
Pretender my sunburn surrender
You set me, set me on fire
You set me, set me on fire
Pretender my sunburn surrender

[Outro]
You set me, set me, set me on
You set me, set me, set me on fire
My sunburn surrender
You set me, set me, set me on
You set me, set me, set me on fire
