I know that I mean nothing to you, babe
I've tried my best to keep these thoughts away
Oh, I try to speak but there's nothing left to say
'Cause I mean nothing to you, babe

[Verse 2]
I know that I mean nothing to you, dear
If ever I stop by you're never here
And I don't mean shit, I know you've made that clear
'Cause I mean nothing to you, dear
[Chorus]
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
Oh

[Verse 3]
I know that I mean nothing to you babe
I'm in your grip from which I can't escape
And I can't help but think that I might
Maybe not mean nothing to you, babe
Oh, babe

[Chorus]
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
Oh

[Bridge]
It's all too much to take
I'm awake, I'm awake
I feel false and I feel fake
But I'm awake, I'm awake
It ain't hard to get sick of my shit
I'm asymmetrical
Get over it for goodness sake
I'm awake, I'm awake
You might also like[Chorus]
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
So make me your queen
So make me your queen

[Outro]
Oh, it's all too much to take
I'm awake, I'm awake22Embed
