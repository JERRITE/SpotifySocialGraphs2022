Sweet and low - new album version LyricsAnywhere you go, anyone you meet
Remember that your eyes can be your enemy
I said well hell is so close and heaven's out of reach
But I ain't giving up quite yet, I've got too much to lose
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down, sweet and low and I'll carry you home
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down and I'll carry you home
Rain is gonna fall, the sun is gonna shine
The wind is gonna blow, the water's gonna rise
She said, "When that day comes look into my eyes"
But no one's giving up quite yet, we've got too much to lose
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down, sweet and low and I'll carry you home
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
So hold me down
And I'll carry you all the way when you say you're fine
But you're still young and out of line
When all I need's to turn around
To make it last, to make it count
I ain't gonna make the same mistakes
That put my mama in her grave
I don't wanna be alone
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
Hold me down, sweet and low and I'll carry you home
Hold me down, sweet and low, little girl
So hold me down and I'll carry you homeYou might also likeEmbed
