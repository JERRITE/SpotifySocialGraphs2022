Clove that takes out another clavo lyricsletra of "clavo that takes out another nail"

[English Translation]

[Verse 1]
Already knew
Your broken soul, your biography of love
You warned me
There is no synchrony, it was my thing
The fantasy of falling in love someday, me
[Chorus]
I was only the comfort of love you forgave
Nail that takes out another nail, your medicine
I am with which you forgot to the one you wanted
And to which you will love
I already knew, ahhh

[Verse 2]
Already knew
That this war was lost
Sorry, it was my fault
I lied, it was an irony
The fantasy of falling in love someday, me

[Chorus]
I was only the comfort of love you forgave
Nail that takes out another nail, your medicine
I am with which you forgot to the one you wanted
And the one you will love
Already knew

[Bridge]
And he has no remedy, no
I was only the intermediate I
It hurts and it's like that, I for you
I was only the comfort of love you forgave
Nail that takes out another nail, your medicine

Ahhh

And the one you will love
It would never be Embed
