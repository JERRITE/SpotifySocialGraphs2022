Thus Lyrics (Danny Bvndz)
Some time ago, I don't forget your body

(Davie Reel)
I just want to do so
Dancing all night
Close to you
That I also know what you want from me
Just tell me if you stay here
Here here
For you for me
(Danny Bvndz)
Bring it, let me see you in it
Put it Well Together Let Me Feel It
Let me show you that i really mean
Save the last dance make me spend it

I Just Wanna Know You
Keep That Shit A 100 Girl I Told You

(Davie Reel)
I just want to do so
Dancing all night
Close to you
That I also know what you want from me
Just tell me if you stay here
Here here
Dale asks for another bottle
That I stay with you seeing the stars
You are my baby, my maiden
Oh what a beautiful woman
Give it dare
And let's turn on DMT
To make my baby
Whenever you want
And do it in a thousand ways
I just want to do so
Dancing all night
Near you
That I also know what you want from me
Just tell me if you stay here
Here here
For you for me
