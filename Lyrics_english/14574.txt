I Still Worry LyricsDo you ever still wake up late on the weekend
Do you ever still sing a long when you’re driving
Do you soak in a bubble bath when you feel blue
Do you fall asleep with the lights on like you used to

Do you ever still call your mum when you feel sad
Do you ever still slam the door when you get mad
Even after all this time you’re no longer in my life
It’s crazy girl I just don’t know why

I still worry ‘bout you everyday
I’m still wondering if you’re okay
After everything that we’ve been through
Girl I’ll never stop caring for you
I still ask about you now and then
I still wish somеtimes we could still be friеnds
Even though you’re no longer in my life
I know I shouldn’t be
But I still worry about you
(I still worry about you)

Did you start again and move back to the city
Did it take you long to move on and forget me
Did you find somebody new to make you happy
Did you give up on your dreams and start a family

Does he give you everything you’ve ever wanted
In the middle of the night are you still lonely
Do you ever think of me
Am I ever in your dreams
It’s crazy girl I just can’t believe

I still worry ‘bout you everyday (I still)
I’m still wondering if you’re okay
After everything that we’ve been through
Girl I’ll never stop caring for you (I’ll never stop it baby)
I still ask about you now and then
I still wish sometimes we could still be friends
Even though you’re no longer in my life
I know I shouldn’t be
But I still worry about you
(I still worry…… about you)
(I still worry…… about you)
(I still worry)
You might also likeI know I shouldn’t be
But I still worry about youEmbed
