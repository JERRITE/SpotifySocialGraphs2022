California Dreaminâ€™ (LP Giobbi Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
All the leaves are
All the leaves are brown
All the leaves are
And the sky is gray

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day
[Post-Chorus]
California
Day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day

[Verse 1]
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher lights the coals (Preacher lights the coals)
He knows I'm gonna stay (Knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and
Day
Day
Day
Day
