I know your new man can't do you better than I did
Shit, I feel bad for him 'cause he don't know that you toxic
Fuck it, I should've never let you been the one that I trusted
Ayy, disgusted
Turned out to be everything that I thought that you wasn't, look
And you know where to find me, yeah
I've been in my mind, shit is troublin' me
And you know where to find me
I'll be high by my lonely, feelin' like a mountain-top
And you know where to find me
I've been in my mind, shit is troublin' me
And you know where to find me
I'll be high by my lonely, feelin' like a mountain-top

New bitch, she my sidekick
No Robin, but she thick
