Honda Civic - Work Tape Lyrics[Intro]
Zero, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Ruin my ears loudly with shitty dance music
Can't dance myself clean enough to feel like a real person
Now Frances is my Frisco, she plays volleyball at Yale
Took a hit from a stranger, so I got her email

It won't even matter which photographs I like
She'll just stay on my phone, 'til she forgets that I'm alive
I hate the way I am, and I hate the way things are
Maybe singing, thinking, walking to my car
[Chorus]
What’s the point of dancing
If I just go home alone
In my Honda Civic
I don’t even fucking own?
Seems all my good intentions
Are just drying up with age
So if I die alone
I’ll only have myself to blame

[Verse 2]
I had a few more, now she smokes, it's ringing in my ear
She said that she likes singing in the spirit, Ever clear
Definitely not touched someone, or actually play it cool
Fuck my insecurities, and fuck this fucking fool

Now I'm doing 90, and it's 3 o'clock at night
And I feel like a piece of shit for speeding, fuck my life
'Cause I don't wanna be out, and I don't want to be home
Just looking for some danger, to pretend that I have grown

[Chorus]
What’s the point of dancing
If I just go home alone
In my Honda Civic
I don’t even fucking own?
Seems all my good intentions
Are just drying up with age
So if I die alone
I’ll only have myself to blame
You might also like[Bridge]
I may not be in love with you but flirt and play pretend
Meet you in New Haven, introduce me to your friends
Take me to a party where I will not do some drugs
Run into the bathroom with an everlasting shrug
And when it all is over and you're nowhere to be found
I'll find myself singing to a thirty-person crowd
A ballad or a eulogy, who really gives a fuck?
'Cause if I die alone, it will not be because of luck

[Outro]
What’s the point of dancing
If I just go home alone
In my Honda Civic
I don’t even fucking own?
Seems all my good intentions
Are just drying up with age
So if I die alone
I’ll only have myself to blame2Embed
