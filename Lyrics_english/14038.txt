Baby Teeth Lyrics[Verse 1: joe p]
Some big suit
Has got my balls
So I stay up late
Waiting for his call
And all the boys
Have dirt on one knee
But I'm so good
At keeping both clean (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: joe p]
A drop of bleach in the waterline
Wake up thinking with a clearer mind
[Pre-Chorus: Both]
I should've never let you talk me down
But you've got a way with words that made me turn around
We watched home movies 'til we fell asleep
Back then you looked like you
And I looked just like me (Okay)

[Verse 2: Mothica, joe p]
All alone (All alone)
With a hand and a feeling (Aw yeah)
Once or twice (Once or twice)
And only on the weekеnd (That's okay)
Take me back (Da-da-da-da)
To '93 (da-da-da-da-da-da)
Both eyеs shut (Both eyes shut)
And baby teeth (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
A drop of bleach in the waterline
Wake up thinking with a clearer mind

[Chorus: Both]
I should've never let you talk me down
But you've got a way with words that made me turn around
We watched home movies 'til we fell asleep
Back then we both stared at the sun
And we were younger
But I wonder how much better we could see
You might also like[Bridge: joe p, Mothica, Both]
Stocked on a shelf
But I don't think we'll ever sell
We'll both go bad
But I'll stay if you don't mind the smell
I'm exactly where you left me
'Cause I don't really mind the smell
Still looking for the rest of me
The customers can't even tell
Why'd you have to take the best of me
This is the best that I have ever felt

[Chorus: Both]
I should've never let you talk me down
But you've got a way with words that made me turn around
We watched home movies 'til we fell asleep
Back then you looked like you
And I looked just like

[Outro: Mothica, joe p]
This is the best that I have ever felt
Oh, oh1Embed
