Shadow People Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been out of my mind here lately
'Till we were staying in
What's my name if you don't mind?
I see the world ain't fixed
Got the town in a pool game
I'm always better when I'm high
See my girl change her last name
And I'm so happy it ain't mine

[Chorus]
I'm I dreamin'?
Is it something that I've done
To push you away
The things I've loved
There's something that won't be enough
Am I crazy?
Should we throw away the key?
And leave me locked up
With the screams of the shadow people that talk to me
[Verse 2]
I've been talking to God here lately
He must be busy, I guess
'Cause all I've heard is ringin'
All the halls got me spinnin'
He ain't askin' me yet
What the hell is wrong with me?
I'm not the kid I used to be
If I tell you I can change
You should be rude and exchange
Please have a blessed day

[Chorus]
I'm I dreamin'?
Is it something that I've done
To push you away
The things I've loved
There's something that won't be enough
Am I crazy?
Should we throw away the key?
And leave me locked up
With the screams of the shadow people that talk to me

[Interlude]
Please don't talk to me
Please don't talk to me
Please don't talk to me
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm I dreamin'?
Is it something that I've done
To push you away
The things I've loved
There's something that won't be enough
Am I crazy?
Should we throw away the key?
And leave me locked up
With the screams of the shadow people that talk to me

[Outro]â€‹
Ohhh
Am I crazy?
Should we throw away the key?
To a place where I'm locked up
With the screams of the shadow people that talk to meEmbed
