My Lyricsdime wife if you know ... 
 If you've seen my wife 
 Have you seen my wife? 
 On the street 
 And beyond 
 Where is my wife? 
 On the street 
 Here 
 Over there 
 Over there 
 Have you seen my wife? 
 On the street 
 In the club 
 At the disco 
 Have you seen my wife? 
 Hey tell me if you know 
 If you have seen me my wife 
 Short hair 
 On the shore 
 A clavodil 
 Hey you talk to me 
 You talk to me about sex 
 Of love 
 None 
 I don't know how to understand IUU MIGHT ALSO Likeembed
