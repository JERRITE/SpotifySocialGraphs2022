Choke on the Ashes of Your Hate Lyrics[Verse 1]
Faithless weaponize, mass corrupted lies, poison everything
False conspiracy, soulless enemy, dead for all to see
Look around and see the great decay
Violence turns the fearful into slaves

[Chorus]
Choke
On the ashes of your hate
And it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside its rotting cage
[Verse 2]
Sick society, lost in vanity, paid to slowly die
Lifeless reprobate, soul incarcerate, cutting like a knife
Shoving their vile vеnom down our throats like Klonopin
Force feed their liеs back like medicine

[Chorus]
Choke
On the ashes of your hate
And it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside this rotting cage

[Bridge]
Chaos cratering
Riots, anarchy
Lawlessness abounds
All of us hell-bound
We're the damaged ones
Left with the damage done
We don't care no more
This is fucking war
Chaos cratering
Riots, anarchy
Lawlessness abounds
All of us hell-bound
We're the damaged ones
Left with the damage done
We don't care no more
This is fucking war
Mutator bastard
Bow to your master
Dead men, no worry
Welcome hell's fury

[Verse 3]
Mock and penalize, vex and victimize, starving refugee
Race identity, burning you and me, cinders char the free
Lowing like a shackled animal
Day of slaughter only time will tell

[Outro]
Choke
On the ashes of your hate
And it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside this rotting cage
Choke
On the ashes of your hate
And it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside this rotting cage2Embed
