I can't be without you Lyrics [letter from "I can't be without you"]

[Verse 1]
Here I am, I see the rain fall
And it seems that this day does not end
Here I am wondering
Until when they can
These photos save myself

[Chorus]
And I can't take it anymore
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can not be without you
[Verse 2]
And I look at the wind, his caress took
A feeling that speaks to me but I don't understand
I know no, I know no
I am the one who is right
But I can't accept it

[Chorus]
And I can't take it anymore
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can not be without you

[Chorus]
Is that I no longer endure you
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can not be without you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
And I can't take it anymore
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can not be without you

Is that I no longer endure you
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can not be without you
Being waiting hurts me
I can't be without trembed
