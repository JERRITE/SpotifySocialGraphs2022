Maybe (remix) lyrics [letter of "perhaps (remix)" ft. Ken-y]

[Intro: wisin]
P.R., this is the world premiere of "Maybe", the remix
Tony Dize, with Mr. Ken-and
These do put it, daddy
I will not throw you 'that you do not know' swim
Submit it!

[Pre-car: Tony Dize, Wisin, Ken-y]
Looking where there is nothing
I no longer want to argue, what to continue?
Treating, with the illusion that one day you love me
As I want, but I'm a game
It's pa 'ti, baby
You are looking for revenge
I look for a dream in you
Tony Dize
Tell me then we do ...
Ken-y
[Chorus: Ken-y]
Maybe you loved who you shouldn't love
You made a fatal decision
They hurt you and that made you bad
And I had to pay
Maybe he cheated you and I don't really love you
It was an adventure, game and nothing more
They never gave you the opportunity
And I had to pay

[Verse 1: tony dize]
You believe that you love me
I want to believe
He knew what we feel
Although we didn't want it in the heart
How good we lie
And nobody is saved from love
Why deceive ourselves like that?
How to force you to love me?

[Choir: Tony Dize, Ken-y]
Maybe you loved who you shouldn't love
You made a fatal decision
They hurt you and that made you bad
And I had to pay
Maybe he fools you
And it didn't really love you
It was an adventure, game and nothing more
They never gave you the opportunity
And I had to pay
You Might Also Like [verse 2: Ken-y]
I know they have already hurt your heart
And that you are afraid of another disappointment
I know your smiles have changed
That many dreams left
When he left and I leave you
But if you gave me an opportunity
Maybe you would love again
Maybe

[Pre-car: Ken-y]
Looking where there is nothing
I no longer want to argue, what to continue?
Treating, with the illusion
That one day you love me
As I want, but I'm a game
You are looking for revenge
I look for a dream in you
Tell me what do we do

[Choir: Tony Dize, Ken-y]
Maybe you loved who you shouldn't love
You made a fatal decision
They hurt you and that made you bad
And I had to pay
Maybe he fools you
And it didn't really love you
It was an adventure, game and nothing more
They never gave you the opportunity
And I had to pay
[Verse 3: Tony dize]
I felt need, tired I was already
The most bitter penalty wrapped me
I wanted to know how to cry
I looked for the most fatal, I even thought to kill
The day I wanted her most
I lost my happiness
They say it's a matter of fooling in love
Have feelings
Loving today is just a kiss
No one is promised beyond time
No one believes in the eternal
My love, but not for that
We didn't have to be the same

[Chorus: Ken-y, Tony Dize, Wisin]
You might love who you should not love (definitely, a joint for history, certified by the great exponents of this movement)
Did you make a fatal decision (those who control the area, bro ', okay?)
They hurt you and that made you bad (very much)
And I had to pay (for you, Latin women)
Maybe he cheated you (E 'a Wy Record initiative')
And he didn't really love you (Pina Record ')
It was an adventure, game and nothing else (only half an well, boy ', calmly)
They never gave you the opportunity (this is the world premiere of "Maybe")
And I had to pay

[Outro: wisin]
