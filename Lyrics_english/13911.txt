Taking Pictures of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have a secret I want to tell you
Each time that I close my eyes, I can feel you
I run away with my imagination
And I am blinded by your light, you fill up the room
Oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I have a secret I need to tell you
Exquisite visions fill up my mind
[Chorus]
Do you remember me taking pictures of you
As the light came through?
You were running away
And I asked you for a place to stay
Do you remember me taking pictures of you?
Taking pictures of you

[Verse 3]
Now, I have a secret I need to tell you
I have been true and I needed no clue
We live in such extraordinary times
Exquisite visions fill up my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember me taking pictures of you
As the light came through?
You were running away
And you asked me for a place to stay
Do you remember me taking pictures of you?
Such a wonderful thing to doYou might also like5Embed
