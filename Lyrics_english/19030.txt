Die with a Beer in Your Hand LyricsSpitting fire, my desire
And then I will retire
After the Demons have been fought back into Hell
Howls in the Night
A Pack of Wolves surround me
Reborn in Steel, it´s time to fight

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell´s Virgins
Diving in that Hole
Sword held higher - who´s the Liar?
I have the Beer of Fire
We shit on all the stories that you have to tell
Stand up and fight!!
You Losers take a back seat
Tankard is back, and doin´ it right

Refrain:
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand

Industrifier! Thousand buyers
A mystic World for hire
Our lust for beer outweighs the Tales they fucking tell
Were in the right
Alcohol my Lightmare
Shows me the way, when is the fight?

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell´s Virgins
Diving in that Hole

Lust for Metal, cry for battle
It seems we´re not in sync
Our feelings differ yet we all are doing well
We have a goal
You Bastards shall be done for
You don´t drink Beer, Pussy Hole

Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand

Spitting fire, my desire
And then I will retire
After the Demons have been fought back into Hell
Howls in the Night
A Pack of Wolves surround me
Reborn in Steel, it´s time to fight

Backed by the Devil
He has my Soul
Victory in the smell of Hell´s Virgins
Diving in that Hole

Refrain:
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your hand
Die my Friend - Because this is the end
Make a final stand and die with a Beer in your handEmbed
