Work to Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
It took some time, we made progress
I hold it down for you
We done put too much and
I done lost too many friends
So let's make it official and work out the issues
Together we gon' win
If you take my life in the shape it's in
See me for the greatness I possess within
Know you'll get all of me
All my honesty
No part-time, girl, I'll climb, if you climb with me
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, give me all your flaws, don't care, you're beautiful
If you can love me at my worst, livin' like you're gone

[Chorus]
When you come from the bottom, faced with the problems
Tryin' to solve 'em on your own
Makes lovin' me not so easy
Missin' some pieces, thought you complete me
This love is possible but girl, we got some work to do
We got some work to do
Said if you work on me
Girl, I will work on you

[Verse 2]
They say that pressure creates diamonds
Borderline, ooh girl, I can't lie
When I get lost, will you come find me?
Love me when it's possible
You know I ride for you, if you ride for me
I ain't perfect but I'm worth it, baby, vibe with me
I need someone to believe in
When I don't believe in me (Oh baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, give me all your flaws, don't care, you're beautiful (Oh, oh, don't care, you're beautiful, you're beautiful)
If you can love me at my worst, livin' like you're gone (Oh, oh, woah)
You might also like[Chorus]
When you come from the bottom, faced with the problems
Tryin' to solve 'em on your own
Makes lovin' me not so easy
Missin' some pieces, thought you complete me (Missin' some pieces)
This love is possible but girl, we got some work to do (Know we got some, know we got some)
We got some work to do (Know we got some)
Said if you work on me (Oh, oh, oh)
Girl, I will work on you (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)4Embed
