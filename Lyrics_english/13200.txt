Crying All the Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
My death, it haunts him like a ship
Without a sail
I know I'll be gone soon
But just for him, I will prevail

[Chorus]
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
And now he's gone, so I'm crying all the time
[Post-Chorus]
Crying all the time
Crying all the time

[Verse 2]
My death, it taunts me like a ship
Without a sail
I know I'll be gone soon
But just for him, I will prevail

[Chorus]
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
And now he's gone, so I'm crying all the time

[Post-Chorus]
Crying all the time
Crying all the time
Crying all the time

[Chorus]
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
He doesn't like it when I cry (Cry, cry, cry)
And now he's gone, so I'm crying all the timeYou might also like4Embed
