Lyrics look ["Mirala" ft letter. Zion & Farruko]

[Pre-car: Zion, Farruko]
Look at her, where she goes there (where he goes there)
As she dresses
Irresistible, she is melting

Look at her, where she goes around (just look at her)
With her pikete, she walks with her rebel friend
He doesn't care what people say
[Chorus: Zion]
What do you want with me na ’ma’
In search of a sexual fantasy
Only a real adventure
Someone who took it for a walk

What do you want with me na ’ma’
In search of a sexual fantasy
Only a real adventure
Someone who took it for a walk

[Verse 1: Farruko]
What she wants is to go to the street on fire
Go with her friends, always in the jangueo
It is mounted in the polaris, Sundays is a chinchorreo
And border on Instagram because he likes the Titereo
It's done done, he likes gangsters
Always arranged, and in fashion is here
She beats To'as, even envious
What I like most is that the baby is not jealous

[Bridge 1: Farruko]
Me too
How do I not leave and I like them like that
I threw the lip and convinced it
To win one and get out of here
You Might Also Likey Yo
How do I not leave and I like them like that
I threw the lip and convinced it
To win one and get out of here

[Chorus: from the ghetto, zion]
What do you want is Na ’Ma’ Action
In search of a sexual fantasy
Only a real adventure
Someone who took it for a walk

What do you want with me na ’ma’
In search of a sexual fantasy
Only a real adventure
Someone who took it for a walk

[See 2: From the ghetto]
Look at her, look, she's complete perfect
Your killing walk, with me connects
My rhythm is adrenaline that she injected
The others only envy her because she releases
Do not look at me or stick that she is willing
[?] Without reverse
Go from the album to my bed to which it lends
It makes a thousand pranks that ensures that it bursts it
She wants me to take her to space
And that it mountains in the rocket slowly
Live the movie, farandulate for a while
Fronta with the friend as I do it
[Bridge 2: from the ghetto]
She wants, what they put him.
She has an obsession with me
She seeks to make love
Your body asks, satisfaction

She wants, what they put him.
She has, with me an obsession
She seeks to make love
Your body asks, satisfaction

[Pre-Coro: Zion, Farruko, De la Ghetto]
Look at her, where she goes there (where he goes there)
As she dresses
Irresistible, she is melting

Look at her, how she goes there (where she goes there)
With her pikete, she walks with her rebel friend
He doesn't care what people say

[Chorus: Zion, from the ghetto]
What do you want with me na ’ma’
In search of a sexual fantasy
Only a real adventure
Someone who took it for a walk

What do you want is Na ’Ma’ Action
In search of a sexual fantasy (okay)
Only a real adventure (Geezy Boyz)
Someone to take it for a walk (bifi)
