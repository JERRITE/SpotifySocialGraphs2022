Smoke Talk Lyrics[Intro: Smoove’L]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Smoove’L]
I swear to God, I could never let 'em
My ex ask about me, bitch, I'm doin' better
I'm drippin' and drownin' up in any weather
They call me Smoove'L, I'm the trendsetter
I shoot to the M, lethal chopper
Don't look for your bitch 'cause I got her
Her head game was so trash, made me so mad that a nigga had to stop her, dumb bitch
[Verse 1: Smoove’L & NLE Choppa]
Don't act up (Don't act up), I'ma tell you right now, I'll act up (Bah)
Old boy start movin' wrong then the blood is drawn, bitch, I'm blowin' your back up (Bllrt, boom)
Niggas say it's on sight, but it's not on sight (What?)
Stupid nigga, you really think we gon' fight (Fight, what?)
Bullets knock through his head, give him noodle legs (Bah)
Pussy, you just got ate like a Mike and Ike, yum
Amber Rose (What?), I can't lie, I want head from Amber Rose (What?)
Gotta see if that head real, mentally ill, make a young nigga curl his toes (Uh, uh, uh)
And your bitch say you stink (Yeah), you need to go wipe your ass before tryna wipe a nose (Word)
I'ma bang on a pipe if you get out your body, I'll show that lil' bitch I'm straight out the 4 (Baow)
And I wanna fuck in the Montana
Told her, "Pass me the phone, I don't do no cameras"
And don't ask me a question I never answer (Ooh)
That bitch loyal to you, I don't understand her (No)
I jump on the bitch and turn up the heat (Yeah)
Nigga give me your plate, I gotta eat (Uh)
But hold up, I'm done, I rocked up the party (Yeah), I'll pass this bitch on, on to NLE, gang (Uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: NLE Choppa]
Pass her to me, then she better be a freak
Why you take your clothes off, baby girl, get on your knees
I'm fuckin' with models, fuckin' with strippers
Throwin' cash in the club because I'm a tipper
Bend it over, make her ass get bigger
Groupie hoes only takin' pictures
Posin' with this .30, man, a nigga better not move wrong
We doin' what we rappin', and I put that shit in every song
When I bust a nut I tell a bitch to put her shoes on
Get the fuck up out of my house, a nigga had to move on (Yeah)
I'm poppin' these percs, I'm stuffin' my face
I keep me a lawyer, I'm beatin' the case
I think I won't beat it, I'm doin' the race
I'm runnin' away, far from the Jakes, ayy
Ayy, that Rollie, bitch, it's slimed out
That glizzy, yeah, that .9 out
Yeah, that Rollie, bitch, it's slimed out
Glizzy got them .9's out (Yeah)

Her head game was so trash, made me so mad
That a nigga had to stop her, dumb bitchEmbed
