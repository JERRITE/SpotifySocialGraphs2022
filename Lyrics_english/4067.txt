TranslationEnglishsola is better Lyrics ["Solo is better" letter]

[Intro: Yandar]
That's why I don't fall in love, because this area is undermined with bad
Of bad, bad, very bad women
That damage your heart
That's why I'm alone, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-car: Karol G]
My heart is very large and there are several quereres (several quereres)
That is why I do not commit to me and I dedicate myself to enjoy the pleasures (pleasures)
I have had several experiences with ancient loves (ancient loves)
That is why I am intelligent and I learned from all those mistakes (ey, ey)
[Chorus: Karol G]
And that's why I'm alone, because it is better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always tell you that they love you
But in the end they deceive you
And that's why I'm alone, because it is better (wicked-or)
That being bad accompanied by a false love (master-or)
They always tell you that they love you (ey)
But in the end they deceive you (ah)

[Verse: karol g]
They say I'm the best, that's why I enjoy it
LIVE LIVING THIS LIFE MINUTE TO MINUTE
I continue in mine, with nobody I argue
Love I killed him, today he was in mourning (ey, ah, ah)
Now I'm leaving weekend without checking the cel (cel)
You don't ere 'my Bad Bunny and I your baby girl (Baby Girl)
I got tired of being accused of being unfaithful (ah, ah)
While 'I gave everything for the fool (huh, eh)
Now I'm leaving weekend without checking the cel (cel)
You don't ere 'my Bad Bunny and I your baby girl (Baby Girl)
I got tired of being accused of being unfaithful (ah)
While I gave everything for the fool

[Chorus: Karol G]
And that's why I'm alone, because it is better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always tell you that they love you
But in the end they deceive you
And that's why I'm alone, because it is better
That being bad accompanied by a false love
They always tell you that they love you
But in the end they deceive you
