Still Not Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
My best friend died, he didn't make it
Looked at his life and decided to take it
Wonder what he thought when he was standing on the edge
Guess we all can go and ask him when we meet up in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so glad just to be alive
I'm gonna sit back and take my time

[Chorus]
I got a blue suit in the neon sky
I got big plans and we got all night
I'm in the parking lot on a beautiful high
And I'm still not dead
I got big dreams, sun and moon
I got a spot in the backseat next to you
I got brand new shoes, nothing to lose
And I'm still not dead
[Verse 2]
You took my hеart out and put it back together
Had a morphine drеam I was floating like a feather
I thought I caught a glimpse of the other side
I talked to my dad and cried
I was in the same hospital where he died
He told me not to worry, I could do it myself
Make it feel like heaven while I'm giving them hell
I'm not gonna waste this life
I'm just lucky that I got to live twice, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so glad just to be alive
I'm gonna sit back and take my time

[Chorus]
I got a blue suit in the neon sky
I got big plans and we got all night
I'm in the parking lot on a beautiful high
And I'm still not dead
I got big dreams, sun and moon
I got a spot in the backseat next to you
I got brand new shoes, nothing to lose
And I'm still not dead

[Verse 3: Wes Period]
Thank goodness I'm alive and swell
Took the shot, hit the moon, look how high I fell
Now inspiration isn't ever anywhere
I got way too many stories I can tell, ah
Your little sister be just fine
That's what I told aunt Bella on her bedside
Lost a lot of people last year far too soon
Had me drinking lots of Stella, thought I lost my cool
Then I found God in a jukebox
Now I'm back and I'm singing from the rooftops
Bury me in 24k when I'm gone
If your heart stay gold you can never go wrong

High, what a beautiful high
What a beautiful life, it's a beautiful life, yeah
High, what a beautiful high
It's a beautiful life

[Chorus]
I got a blue suit in the neon sky
I got big plans and we got all night
I'm in the parking lot on a beautiful high
And I'm still not dead
I got big dreams, sun and moon
I got a spot in the backseat next to you
I got brand new shoes, nothing to lose
And I'm still not dead

[Outro]
