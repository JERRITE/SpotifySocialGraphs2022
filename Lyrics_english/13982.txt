Sad Happy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was waiting so sad happy
Thought I lost you in a nightmare dream
You were too high to hold on
I was losing all track of time
For a moment I thought I’d died
Searching for someone

[Pre-Chorus]
But I will not find myself tonight
No, I will not find myself tonight
[Chorus]
But you can’t see
My heart’s made out of concrete
You know me, I’m sad happy
You know me, I’m sad happy
No, you can’t see
My heart’s made out of concrete
You know me, I’m sad happy
You know me, I’m sad happy

[Verse 2]
I was dancing with my eyes wide shut
Trying not to think too much
Too high to fall down
So wait for me, sad happy
I know this feels like a dream
But the good times will come round

[Pre-Chorus]
But I will not find myself tonight
No, I will not find myself tonight

[Chorus]
But you can’t see
My heart’s made out of concrete
You know me, I’m sad happy
You know me, I’m sad happy
No, you can’t see
My heart’s made out of concrete
You know me, I’m sad happy
You know me, I’m sad happy
