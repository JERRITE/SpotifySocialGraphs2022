Don't be so cruel lyricsno I understand, I still don't understand you 
 If I am dying for you when I will not see you here 
 I don't understand, I still don't understand you 
 If you leave me, I can't live without your love 

 Don't be so cruel to me, I need you 
 You will see that I will always love you 
 Don't be so cruel to me, just one 
 Hope, a reason to live 

 I want night by night to see you in my dreams 
 That silence with some kiss makes me feel 
 I want to go from the sea to heaven 
 Teach you all how beautiful there is for you 
 Don't be so cruel to me, I need you 
 You will see that I will always love you 
 Don't be so cruel to me, just one 
 Hope, a reason to live 
 Don't be so cruel to me, don't be so cruel to me 
 You will see that I will always love Might Also Likeembed
