Perfectly Imperfect Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're the last crack on the pavement
You're the water running cold
Into the wild washed up and wasted
You're staying up, you're staying up at night
You're the flower in the concrete
Find your way into the light
I want to show you what you can't see
You're keeping me up, keeping me up at night

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me give you every colour that I find in your eyes
[Chorus]
You wake me up and it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it
You don't know why I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
You live like you're a secret
One that only I could know
'Cause I said
"You know what I wanted
I know who you are
I know when I hold you and love you, you'll get up and go
Before you fall apart"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring you every colour that I find in your eyes

[Chorus]
You wake me up and it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it
You don't know why I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love so
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Call me when you want me
And I'll come running
Find me waiting at your door
So tell me if you're lonely and it won't last long 'cause
I'm in love with you
Ooh

[Bridge]
You wake me up and it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect

[Chorus]
You wake me up and it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it
You don't know why I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love with you3Embed
