Say Youâ€™ll Be Mine Lyrics[Intro]
(Say you'll be mine)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I was hypnotized
When I looked into your eyes
Saw the love I'd been waiting for
Couldn't help but fantasize
'Bout a world where you and I
Stay together for evermore
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't hesitate
'Cause I can't control my feelings
Just can't wait
Now I know where this is leadin'

[Chorus]
Baby, please, this heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time
Say you'll be mine
It's not hard to do
Just tell me you feel it too
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine)

[Verse 2]
Took a spark to start the fire
Fan the flame of my desire (My desire)
Turn the light on my destiny
And it took me by surprise
All the love I felt inside (Felt inside)
Now I know it was meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
And step by step
I can feel how close we're getting
Can't stop yet
'Cause I know where this is heading
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, please (Baby, please), this heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time (Don't waste it)
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine)
It's not hard to do (Oh, no)
Just tell me you feel it too (Feel it too)
Baby, it's time (It's time)
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine)
Baby, it's time (It's time)
Say you'll be mine

[Bridge]
(Say it) All you gotta do is say it (Just say)
You're the one I've been waiting for
(Say It) All you gotta do is say it (Just say)

[Chorus]
Baby, please, this heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time
Say you'll be mine
It's not hard to do (Not hard to do)
Just tell me you feel it too (Feel it too)
Baby, it's time (Come on)
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine)

[Post-Chorus]
Say, say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine, you'll be mine)
Say, say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine, you'll be mine)
Say, say you'll be mine (Be mine)
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine, say you'll be mine)
[Chorus]
Baby, please (Baby, please), this heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time (Don't waste it)
Say you'll be mine (Say you'll be mine)
