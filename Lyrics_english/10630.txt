Electrical Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hazes from New York
Slow burning
Blue screen come down
Transition from night to day
I’m synthesized but profound
Ho-oh-o-oh
Ho-oh-o-oh
Ho-oh-o-oh
Form a new vessel, seducing
Don’t let me leave
Slip deep into white coloured sheets
I found you in Sydney
[Chorus]
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
With wires that make me tremble (So electrical)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
The whine of the distant rumble (So electrical)
I’m so electrical

[Verse 2]
Big announcements, slowly devoured
Tear out the fuse
Realization
Who released it?
Call up the tribune

[Chrous]
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
With wires that make me tremble (So electrical)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
The whine of the distant rumble (Rumble, rumble)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
With wires that make me tremble (So electrical)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
The whine of the distant rumble (So electrical)

[Bridge]
Ho-oh-o-oh
Ho-oh-o-oh
Ho-oh-o-oh
So electrical (So electrical)
Ho-oh-o-oh (I'm so electrical)
Ho-oh-o-oh (I'm so electrical)
Ho-oh-o-oh (So electric)
I'm so electrical

I’m nothing more than skin and bone
With wires that make me tremble (So electrical)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
The whine of the distant rumble (Rumble, rumble)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
With wires that make me tremble (So electrical)
I’m nothing more than skin and bone
The whine of the distant rumble (So electrical)
I’m so electricalEmbed
