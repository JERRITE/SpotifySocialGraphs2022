Chewing Cotton Wool LyricsShe's the only one around
And she's turning off the lights
And she's inside every crack
She's the only thing in sight

She's the only one I see
And she's flying through the air
She's the dust upon the sill
She's everywhere
And she's breaking up the line
And she's sitting in the rain
She's the trailer for a film
She's the curtain at the end
She's the sound of your own voice
She's someone else's drink
She's like living in the countryside
She's the whirlpool in the sink
She's a memory I recall
And she's waiting in the hall
She's the monster in the fridge
She's chewing cotton woolYou might also like10Embed
