The Nerve Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got a lot of nerve
I've got a little time
So try to make it hurt
It's nothing that I haven't heard a thousand times

[Chorus]
And you've got your little girlfriends
So here we go again
See, I don't ever care to know the parts of you you never show
You think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
So go, go away
Take your things, leave today
Finally get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve
[Verse 2]
You've got your little campaign
A dirty, little smile
A snap inside my left brain
It's something that I haven't heard in quite awhile

[Chorus]
And you've got your little girlfriends
So here we go again
See, I don't ever care to know the parts of you you never show
You think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
So go, go away
Take your things, leave today
Finally get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve

[Bridge]
The careful, careful lies you tell
And the campaign that your body sells
Is the careful carriage ride to hell
Enjoy yourself

[Chorus]
And I don't ever care to know the parts of you you never show
You think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
So go, go away
Take your things, leave today
Finally get what you deserve
Oh, you have got a lot of nerve

You've got a lot of nerve!3Embed
