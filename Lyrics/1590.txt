Simple Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you 'bout all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

[Verse 2]
When I was just nine years old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest
[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and play like a stone
Could be thereâ€™s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

[Verse 3]
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
You tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift

[Chorus]
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and play like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 1 (reprise)]
Well this would be a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew20Embed
