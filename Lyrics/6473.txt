Zombie Love LyricsI was just a lonely man barely living
And my whole life was cold
I'd often check my pulse
Barely breathing
That's life or so I'm told
But when I met you
You were more alive than I even in death
And then we caught our eyes

I tried to speak to you
But you didn't understand
I wanted to be with you no matter what
So I gave you my heart
And you took it literally
And now I'm yours all yours
Zombie love
There's nothing like it
It's our own special land
So let's go onwards
Eating all the brains
We'll do it all together hand in hand

But many people disagree with you and me
They don't want us to come and share
So let's go over
Show them what they're missing
And teach them how to care

We'll take their brains
Change their aims
So they learn to love again
Why do you lot disagree
We could live in harmony
Come out from your dark, cold den
We'll give you all the loving then
We will all be friends again

[instrumental]

I tried to speak to you
I wanted to be with you
Why do you disagree
We could live in harmony
You might also like[dramatic key change]

Zombie love
There's nothing like it
It's our own special land
So let's go forwards
Limping side to side
We'll do it all together
We'll do it all together
We'll do it all together
Do it all together
We'll do it all together hand in hand

If we're blown to pieces
We won't be defeated
We'll always be together until the endEmbed
