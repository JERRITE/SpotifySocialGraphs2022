Heart On Defrost Lyrics[Intro]
(This that Greedy Money)
Uh
Yeah

[Verse]
My heart on defrost
Catch a play and then I speed off
'Bout twenty missed calls
From my bae, she say we need to talk
We damn near argue every day for no reason at all
Been grinding harder every day, 'fore I leave, I'ma ball
Ain't no sleeping, ain't no slipping at all
Grab my pistol 'fore I dip, you think I'm tripping, but nah
I'm a high risk, just how I'm living, I don't forgive, I can't forget it, dawg
I have these visions and keep drifting off (Uh)
I need to leave that purp' alone
Do no disturb me, I ain't heard my phone
I'm riding dirty, but I serve alone
I smoked two and sold 'bout thirty zones
And to keep from killing you, shit, I just murder the song
They keep asking what I'm working on
Shit, patience
Rebuilding one of my houses and my rentals need renovation
Back rapping, it's therapeutic, plus I know they investigating
If I can weather the storm, well, I know that the blessings waiting
Waking up, going running, or yoga and meditation
Still tote, hope I never use it, I don't know about hesitating
Common sense, if you got consequences, better face it
Niggas be catching cases
Then they start giving statements
How you gon' play the victim? That's your choice and you made it
Really ain't complicated, so I minimize conversations
All these niggas is rats, I'm used to dealing with snakes
I put my feelings away
I've been filling my safe
Every time I slide home, I ain't been feeling as safe
So I'm out of there, relocating in 30 days
Trapping out a Air BnB, fucking up shorty rating
Yeah, it's in her name, but she gutter, it's in the game (In the game)
Like EA, the DA know me by my rap name
Task force think I'm selling H, know I shoot like my last name
Back on that bullshit just like I was 'fore the bag came
I don't act the same
When you having change, sometimes you have to change
I'm still myself, real with myself, and that's what matters most
I know what's true, nothing to prove, so I don't have to post
You can tap it and snatch a caption quote (Lito)
Back at it, I might've been happier when I wasn't rapping, though
[Outro]
Lito
Yeah, I learned from you, and I look at the kids like—
