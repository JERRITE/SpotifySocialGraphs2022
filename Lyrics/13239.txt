Curl Up & Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a time when I worshipped the ground you walked on
There was a time when I'd cut off my ear for you
There was a time when I worshipped the towel you dried on
There was a time when I'd kill all my friends for you

[Bridge]
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna beat up inside
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and
[Chorus]
Curl up and die
Curl up and die

[Verse 2]
There was a time
When there was only you and no one
There was a time
When I'd take any pity shag
(Ah)

[Bridge]
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna move to Versailles
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and

[Chorus]
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
I was just the dirt on your shoe
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Curl up and die)
I was just the germs in your flu
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the chip on your tooth
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the me to your you
And I liked being thatYou might also like6Embed
