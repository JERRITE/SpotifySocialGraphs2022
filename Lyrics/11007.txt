New Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't know me anymore, you don't, do ya?
This silver dress feels like a cure, it's like, "Ooh, yeah"
I don't see a metal door, I look through ya
Right at my future

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to drain me and push me and pull me
But I'm not that somebody that you used to bully

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
[Post-Chorus]
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you

[Verse 2]
You're the bitter, I'm the sweet, you know I'm right, yeah
And I feel good out here with me with every fiber (Yeah)
Make a lightning in the deep, shooting fire
It's about to rise, yeah (About to rise, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to drain me and push me and pull me
But I'm not that somebody that you used to bully

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you, over you
Don't you know it's a new moon? (Moon)
And I'm over you, over you

Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now (I'm over you)
Over you, over you bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you

[Bridge]
Treatin' me like that
Spinnin' me like that
You kept rippin' up my emotions, callin' it devotion
You won't get away with that (You won't get away)
Spinnin' me like that (No, no)
I was drownin' in your ocean, now I'm done with that

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's a new moon?
And I'm over you (I'm over you), over you (I'm over you right now)
Don't you know it's a new moon? (Moon)
And I'm over you (I'm over you), over you

[Post-Chorus]
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now (I'm over you)
Over you, over you bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me down, down, down
Bringin' me, bringin' me, bringin' me down, down, down
Over you now, now, now
Over you, over you2Embed
