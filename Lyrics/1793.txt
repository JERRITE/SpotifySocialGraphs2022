Calvinâ€™s Joint Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna wake up
From sleeping in this same bed everyday
Oh the storm been coming, I ain't gonna stay
Keep on tryna get on my own way
How many times should
Should I pass on by that big old willow tree
Just to prove that there ain't nothin here for me
And let me on my way so cheerfully (so cheerfully)
So cheerfully
[Hook]
Is it something in the way
Oh she telling me I changed
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Well I just got to draw the line
And go get my peace of mind
Lord knows I'm trying
Oh lord knows
Is it something in the way
Oh she telling me I changed
Lord knows I'm tryin'
I just got to draw the line
And go get my peace of mind
Lord knows I'm tryin'
(I've been waiting six or seven days for your call)

[Verse 2]
Have I ever told you
That I spend my evenings howling to the moon
And it feels like every star is shining through
I think I doubt you would doubt me too
(You gon' doubt me too)
You gon' doubt me too

[Hook]
Oh is it something in the way
Oh she telling me I changed
Lord knows I'm tryin'
I just got to draw the line
And go get my peace of mind
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Is it something in the way
Oh she telling me I changed
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Ohh
I just got to draw the line
And go get my peace of mind
Lord knows I'm tryin'

Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
Lord knows I've been tryin', friend
