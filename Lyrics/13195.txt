Better Distractions Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sit around until I find something better to spend my time
But nothing's appealin'
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone
And you're not with me
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied
So I'll leave it alone
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name
And make it my own

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
[Verse 2]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me
I don't know what to do
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby
I just wanna see you
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе
And there isn't a lot
Only took a couple times without you here to realize
But I figured it out

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
