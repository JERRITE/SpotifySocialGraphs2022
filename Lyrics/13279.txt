Deep Sea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep sea dive
Got down, but you stayed alive
It's only you down there
You and the bends
Lose your mind
Lose track of breathing in time
It's only you down there
Sleep with the tides

[Chorus]
We can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and blues
[Verse 2]
Die, my love
Breathe in twos and fours
To know what's worth breathing for
Some days it's easier than falling asleep

[Chorus]
We can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and bluesYou might also like4Embed
