Point and Click Lyrics[Verse 1]
Them/Scumbags..
Them/Faghags..
Short eyes/Dope dealers
Drive-bys../"Faith" healers!

[Hook]
I'll be there
Far away..
I'm floating/above it all (Iâ€™ll)
Be there!
I'll be there/far away
I'll be there/for you...
[Chorus]
I'll prove the holy road leads true
The snake charmers../The shoe hangers..
I'll show you Sunday strollers too!
Little gangbangers..
Spirit channelers
I wanna be the one for you!
I'll be the one../I bought a gun!
I wanna be the crowning jewel
Too bad they won't
Believe me, son...

[Hook 2]
I'll be there/Floating/Above it all
I'll be there/Flaming..
Waiting/For youYou might also like1Embed
