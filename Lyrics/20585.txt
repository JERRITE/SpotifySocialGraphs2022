Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not
Lost forever out in the dark
The storm is over, you made it stop
I've come to find you're what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
So I laugh about it, my tears are dry
No doubt about it, I'll be alright
My past behind me, I'm lettin' go
And all that I know
[Chorus]
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
As long as we're together
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better now

[Build]
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be bеtter now)
As long as we're togеther
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now

[Drop]
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not

[Verse 2]
I see the future, it's lookin' bright
I fallin' to you like paradise
The world looks different inside your eyes
What I was missin' is here tonight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So I laugh about it, my tears are dry
No doubt about it, I'll be alright
My past behind me, I'm lettin' go
And all that I know

[Chorus]
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
As long as we're together
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better now

[Drop]
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not

[Bridge]
It's gonna be better now
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
As long as we're together
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better (It's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now
[Drop]
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
Oh, as long as we're together (It's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better nowEmbed
