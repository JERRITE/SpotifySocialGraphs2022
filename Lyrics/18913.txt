Her Black Wings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blackest of the black
Darker than night
Come to me my bleeding light
See she comes
She comes now
Enter oblivion
Yea, here she is
Harder than life
In my arms
See she there
Entwined with love
Unclean she is
[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black...

[Verse 2]
See she comes
On the eve of dusk
In another form
With a scent of rain upon her neck
She brings the lust
Supernatural
Ceasing never
On and on and on
Her stride is such
Mortals freeze
When she walks past

[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black
You might also like[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings
Whoa-oh, under her black wings

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
See she comes
Blacker than pitch
Have to make this fallen bitch
All I want
All I crave
Demoness calls
The bitch is come
For those who wait
Cross the breach in hell
See she is bedeviled with breasts
Enchantment on legs

[Pre-Chorus]
And she comes down to me, yeah
And she offers me sleep
Under her black
[Chorus]
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under her black wings, yeah
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)

She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)
She's got me under wings
(Whoa-oh under her black wings)

[Outro]
Under her black!Embed
