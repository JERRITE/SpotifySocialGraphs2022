I keep dancing with my demons
Give me one good reason I should stay
And I don't trust what I've been feeling
Tell me is it love or chemistry?

[Verse 1]
I guess I do it for the thrill, adrenaline
Wanna make me feel alive
Your love is like a poison pill, venomous
I swallow it every night
[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been talking in my sleep
I know that this will be the end of me
Are we lovers or are we just enemies?
So is it love or is it chemistry?
(And is it love or is it chemistry?)

[Chorus]
I keep dancing with my demons
Give me onе good reason I should stay (Oh-oh, oh, oh)
And I don't trust what I've been feeling
Tell mе is it love or chemistry?

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are like a .45, the bullet hits
I'm always getting hypnotized
I've been living in a lie, I'm good at it
Pretending that it's all alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been grinding all my teeth
Tryna find a way from underneath
The weight of everything you said to me
So is it love or is it chemistry?
And is it love or is it chemistry?
You might also like[Chorus]
I keep dancing with my demons
Give me one good reason I should stay (I should stay)
And I don't trust what I've been feeling
Tell me is it love or chemistry? (Oh-oh, yeah-yeah)Embed
