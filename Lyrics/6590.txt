In the End (Mellen Gi Remix) Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It starts with one
All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Chorus]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2]
It starts with one
All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Chorus]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
