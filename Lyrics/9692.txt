TranslationsEspañolWHO DO U LOVE? Lyrics[몬스타엑스 - WHO DO YOU LOVE? 가사]

[Verse 1: Jooheon & Shownu]
In the heat of the moment
When you're all alone and out of breath
What’s keepin' you goin?
What do you see up in your head?
When your eyes are closing
Where do you wish you were, instead?
You got me hanging by a thread, yeah
Oh, tell me now
[Pre-Chorus: Wonho, Hyungwon, Minhyuk & Jooheon]
Who's the one that takes you higher than
Than you’ve ever been?
Baby, I just got to know the answer
Who's the one you think of night and day?
Ain't no time to waste
I'm just tryna say

[Chorus: All]
Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can’t say that I’m the one for sure
Then I'm walkin’ out the door

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Ayy ayy, skrrt skrrt)
Ayy, I'ma need me a new thing (Thing)
He ain't believe his boo thing
Show me the 'Tity Boi’, 2 Chainz (Whoo)
Now the beef cookin' like Gordon Ramsay (Ramsay)
We should be somewhere that's hot and sandy (Sandy)
Used to post up in New York, like Marcus Camby (Camby)
My two tings fighting, like Monica and Brandy (Brandy)
Now, now in that two door coupe, wait (Wait)
They're asking, "Who you love?", like Cool J (Cool J)
80's baby down the middle, like KD
And1, that's my other lane (Whoo)
Them boys is next, Montana, Monsta X
You might also like[Chorus: All]
Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

[Refrain: All, Jooheon]
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (Say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (Who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who?
(Oh baby, say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who?

[Pre-Chorus: Wonho & Minhyuk]
Who's the one that takes you higher than
Than you've ever been
Who's the one you think of night and day?
Ain't no time to waste, I'm just tryna say

[Chorus: All, Jooheon]
Who do you love? Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love? Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door (Walkin' out the door)
[Refrain: All, Jooheon]
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (Say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who? (Who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love? Who do you love? Who?
