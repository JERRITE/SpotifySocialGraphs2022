Joystick Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't count all the times that I, I had to say I'm sorry
For wanting something with a few more bits than my Atari
Don't play a game, boy
They said it would get old
But sometimes boys like me are curious and can't be told no
You came along and had me saying "What is this?"
Your sexiness had got me ready for the Genesis

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, grab a hold of the joystick
Take control of the motion
I can feel it when you (ahh ahh)
Baby, you make all of the choices
Other players can join us
If you're feeling like you wanna
[Chorus]
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games

If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games

[Verse 2]
Then I upgraded to Nintendo 64
And your first time with the joystick left you feeling like a wh--wh-wh-whore
Hyper gamer, nothing greater, we can play all night
You'd better be some competition 'cause I want a fight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, grab a hold of the joystick
Take control of the motion
I can feel it when you (ahh ahh)
Baby, you make all of the choices
Other players can join us
If you're feeling like you wanna

[Chorus]
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games

If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games

[Bridge]
I don't want you thinking that I'm trying to apply pressure
But the pressure makes it better
Pushing harder makes it wetter
If you wanna skip a level then we'll go to level two
Just beat my boss and get me off
And then I'll play with you

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
Like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games

If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
Grab ahold of the joystick
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
Play games
If you're feeling like you wanna
