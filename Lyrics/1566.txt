You Donâ€™t Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wasn't looking for you when we met
But you caught my eye and then you took my breath away
That summer dress and your auburn hair
Oh, we don't see much of your kind around here

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You started walking in my direction
Never looking down, never breaking the eye connection
Pull me on the floor, you had my full attention
And we moved our feet to the sound of the music, babe
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You don't dance the same as everyone does
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're the drug that I can't get enough of
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now it's not the same as it ever was
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh baby, come on
You don't dance the same as everyone

[Verse 2]
I've only known you for a little while
But girl you've got it, yeah you're driving me wild tonight
I only wish I could read your mind
And give you all your heart desires

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I took your hand and I pulled you closer
Never had a plan, never needed to think it over
I can't understand this feeling that's taking over
As we moved our feet to the sound of the music, babe

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You don't dance the same as everyone does
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're the drug that I can't get enough of
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now it's not the same as it ever was
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh baby, come on
You don't dance the same as everyone does
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The same as everyone else
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, the same as everyone
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You don't dance the same as everyone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, does

[Bridge]
When the night is over, can I walk you home?
I promise you that my intentions are honourable
And if it gets colder, you can have my coat
I'll be alright 'cause you warm my soul
You gave me something I can't explain
I felt it in my heart and now I can't walk away
So hopefully tomorrow we can do it all over again
Yeah, we moved our feet to the sound of the music, babe

[Outro]
Come on
You don't dance the same as everyone does
You're the drug and I can't get enough of you
Now it's not the same as it ever was, no
Oh baby
You don't dance the same as everyoneEmbed
