The Bird and the Worm Lyrics[Verse 1]
He wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

[Chorus]
All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
[Whispered Post-Chorus]
Don't tell on me, don't tell on me
No, don't you tell on me, please
It's okay, don't tell on me, please...

[Verse 2]
Out of his mind, the weight pushes him, whispering
Must've been out of his mind (Out of his mind)
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
May be out of his mind (Out of his mind)

[Chorus]
All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls like a worm (Crawls like a worm!)
Crawls like a worm from a bird (Crawls like a worm!)
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah, ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah)
All he knows
If he can't relieve it, it grows
(All alone) And so it goes (And so it goes)
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird
You might also like[Breakdown]
And he crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a...

[Interlude]
Out of his mind, the weight pushes him, whispering
Must've been out of his mind

[Chorus]
All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside, to
Save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird
All alone, he's holding his breath half to death
(Holding his breath half to death)
Terrified, to save his life
He crawls like a worm (He crawls like a worm!)
Crawls like a worm from a bird (Crawls like a worm!)
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

[Outro]
(*Sinister cackling*)
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone12Embed
