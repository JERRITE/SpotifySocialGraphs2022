Decisions Lyrics[Chorus: Borgore]
Decisions
But I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should've learned how to bake
Yes, I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing

[Drop: Borgore]
You should've learned bitches love cake!
[Chorus: Borgore & Miley Cyrus, Miley Cyrus]
Decisions
But I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should've learned how to bake
Yes, I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should've learned how to bake

[Verse: Borgore]
Decisions between a family or a porn star
Humble life or sports cars
Liver or the whole bar
Headache for my management
Gossip columns resident
Your mom and dad might hate me, but in 5 years I'm the president
I wanna girl, I get her
And I get her friend
Five girls singing in my bedroom, start my own band
They love me in my peak, but this love is fake
Everyday's my birthday, 'cause bitches love cake

[Chorus: Borgore & Miley Cyrus]
Decisions
But I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing
You should've learned how to bake
Yes, I want it all, so I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing

You should've learned bitches love cake!21Embed
