No Choice Lyrics[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
I used to ride on that bus
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Now I pull up in that Porsche
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Diamonds are shining in Court
Was when I wasn't having no choice
I haul out the Porsche
When I wasn't having no choice
I hopped out the Porsche
When I wasn't having no choice
I still get money with forbes
Really wasn't having no choice
I wanted more
When I wasn't having no choice
[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
I remember the days when I weren't having no money
Turn a nick to a dime, turn a fifty to a hundred
Back in the day them bitches was actin real funny
Now if I want I could get that bitch shit out the country
Now if I want I could get the Porsche shipped the country
I'm on all of these rap niggas conscious
But I want all of these rap nigga bitches
John Popi relentless
Three thousand step on the scene
Boy you so fresh and so clean
You bought that bitch Maybelline
I bought that bitch a Celine
There's more to an Atlanta rap nigga, that's out of Atlanta
Upping the standards

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
I used to ride on that bus
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Now I pull up in that Porsche
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Diamonds are shining in Court
Was when I wasn't having no choice
I haul out the Porsche
MJG when I wasn't having no choice
I hopped out the Porsche
When I wasn't having no choice
I still get money when poor
When I wasn't having no choice
I wanted more
When I wasn't having no choice

They asking Johnny Popi come and save the day
She climbing up that pole it ain't no other way
My partner jooged a nigga just the other day
Got it out the mud it ain't no other way
I see your face
Trying to race that Maserati in Vegas
I want a big diamond on my panky
Trying to get that big house on the hill
Wanna see my nigga with a mill
Teacher told me that I wasn't gone make it
Only way to get it was to take it
I see through that shit like panoramic
Now all my wheels from Panameras

[Hook: Johnny Cinco]
I used to ride on that bus
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Now I pull up in that Porsche
Was when I wasn't having no choice
Diamonds are shining in Court
Was when I wasn't having no choice
I haul out the Porsche
MJG when I wasn't having no choice
I hopped out the Porsche
When I wasn't having no choice
I still get money when poor
When I wasn't having no choice
I wanted more
When I wasn't having no choice9Embed
