You Were Always On My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Baby, give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
Because you're always on my mind...

[Outro until Fade]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mindYou might also likeEmbed
