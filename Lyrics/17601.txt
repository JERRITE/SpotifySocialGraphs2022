Need Me Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I had the roses, I had the passion
I had it all but it still didn't happen
I've had the drama and took the pain
But these days I, I just don't feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about you, you, you
What about me, me, me?
Is what we should do, do, do
Leave me in peace
It's all about you, you, you
What about me, me, me?
So long, I'm done
You're gone, tonight I'm out
[Chorus]
I don't need you to need me again (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you and I won't pretend (Yeah-eah)
No, no, no wasting time, I'm calling it the end (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need you, I, I don't need you (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you, I, I don't need you (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again

[Verse 2]
Live the fast life in the slow lane
Had it all but you didn't like the feeling
Boy, you're crazy, boy, you trippin'
Didn't know why you had to dismissin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all about you, you, you
What about me, me, me?
Is what we should do, do, do
Leave me in peace
It's all about you, you, you
What about me, me, me?
So long, I'm done
You're gone, tonight I'm out

I don't need you to need me again (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you and I won't pretend (Yeah-eah)
No, no, no wasting time, I'm calling it the end (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need you, I, I don't need you (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you, I, I don't need you (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need you to need me again

[Bridge]
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't need ya
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't need ya
I don't, I don't, I don't

Yeah, yeah-eah

[Chorus]
