Come Over (Missing You) LyricsMiss mi baby
Hope she ansa mi (busy)
Hello [female voice]

[1st Verse:]
Hello baby can you come over?
Right now loneliness taking over
Mi need you tonight yuh mi lover
Come warm mi up under the cover
Mek we rock til the lampshade turn over
Rub me chest rest yuh head pon mi shoulder
Ah mek we listen sum Anita Baker
Mek love til we wake up the neighbor
[Chorus:]
Girl you're all I need
And I'm always missing you
Miss you miss you
Miss you miss you baby
Miss you miss you, Miss you miss you
I need your tenderness
I can't resist you
Miss you miss you
Miss you miss you baby
Mi miss you miss you miss you

[Bridge:]
Gal hug me up
Squeeze me tight n close
Come har mek me brace yuh pon di King size post
Me and you forever, gal nah go divorce
We toast to long life we ah prosper di most
Love yuh tone ah voice wen yuh call mi name
Ova an ova she scream again
Inna mi arms mi wan yuh fi remain
Til the sunshine come out again
