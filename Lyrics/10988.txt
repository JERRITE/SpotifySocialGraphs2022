Never Be Your Woman (Shy FX Radio Edit) Lyrics[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kinda girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 1: Wiley]
Yo, out every night, I'm in the spotlight
With another girl knowing that it's not right
Ain't gonna work, stop trying
Had enough this time, you're not lying
Though you're feeling the pain but you're not crying
Can't take me I'm on another page
Where the babes wanna take me home
I was out all night didn't make it home
That's more lying
Pull up in the Aston, get out the car
Quick jump the queue, no hiding
Flash (Flash)
Lettin' everybody know I got cash
Show-off, burp when dining
8 diamond rings they're all shining
Bare designers plus I'm designing
Block everybody out when I'm writing
I'm on a hype ting
[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kinda girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Leave the country, no warning
Club swimming, women swarming
See a new ting, get talking
Get acquainted, start walking
That's when I start promising the world
Even though I got a women at home that's past talking
And I wanna get past talking
I got a yard but let's go to your crib
Air Freshener
Wild orchid
What would he get? If she caught him
He would get a punch in the face like Norbit
Turn around, ignore him
Look away like you never saw him
To hold me down might be awkward
Sighted with another woman in Shoreditch
It's my house, I pay the mortgage
You might also like[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kinda girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right kinda girl for you
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your womanEmbed
