Walkinâ€™ Back to Georgia Lyrics[Intro]
Mmhm-mmmm-mmhmmmhm
Mmhm-mm-mmhm-hm

[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' back to Georgia
And I hope she will take me back
Nothin' in my pockets
And all I own is upon my back

[Chorus]
But she's the girl who said she loved me
On that hot dusty Macon road
And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down
With that-a hard lovin' Georgia girl
[Post-Chorus]
Mmhm-mmhmm-mmmhmmhm
Mmm-mmhm-mhmm-hm

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' back to Georgia
She's the only one who knows
How it feels when you lose a dream
And how it feels when you dream alone

[Chorus]
But she's the girl who said she loved me
On that hot dusty Macon road
And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down
With that-a hard lovin' Georgia girl

[Post-Chorus]
Mmhm-mmhmm-mmmhmmhm
Mmm-mmhm-mhmm-hm

[Verse 3]
Georgia can you hear me callin'?
Oh I'll be home in just a while
And if I had to I'd be crawlin'
Just to share another mornin' smile
You might also like[Chorus]
But you're the girl who said you loved me
On that hot dusty long ago
And if you're still around, I'm gonna settle down
With you my hard lovin' Georgia girl

[Post-Chorus]
Mmhm-mmhmm-mmmhmmhm
Mmm-mmhm-mhmm-hm

[Verse 1]
Because I'm walkin' back to Georgia
And I hope she will take me back
Nothin' in my pockets
And all I own is upon my back

[Chorus]
But she's the girl who said she loved me
On that hot dusty Macon road
And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down
With that-a hard lovin' Georgia girl

[Post-Chorus]
Mmhm-mmhmm-mmmhmmhm
Mmhm-mmhm-mhmm-hm
Mmhm-mmhmm-mmmhmmhm
Mmhm-mmhm-mhmm-hmEmbed
