​rather be a ghost Lyrics[Intro: gucccifer]
(​​guccihighwaters)

[Verse 1: guccihighwaters]
She said I look upset, but, girl, there's passion in this frown
'Cause I think I am obsessed with all the love when you're around
Why they want smoke with me? Not a stoner
When she's not here, I'm a loner
She too bad, you can't clone her
I live for her, I'm a donor
[Chorus: guccihighwaters]
(I'd rather be a ghost)
I'd rather be a ghost this season
Disconnected, I don't like the feeling
Thoughts ricochet with the walls and the ceiling
My chest so tight, I can't even feel my breathing

[Verse 2: guardin, guardin & guccihighwaters]
I'll stop breathing
Lie awake in the night, fight the feeling
Fuck love, I'm a mess for a reason
Six feet in the dirt for the season
I don't like this, life without the hue of your iris
Erase your face embedded in my eyelids
Patience paints the face of the silent
Sorry, I'm not coming down, elevated all around, my
Conscience thinks I'm falling out, of
Grip I ripped the bong and now I'm
Stoned beyond belief I know
I fucked it up, it goes to show, that
I get high when I feel low, please
Pick me up and take me home
(Please, pick me up and take me home)
(Pick me up and take me home)

[Pre-Chorus: guccihighwaters]
(I'd rather be a ghost this season)
(I'd rather be a ghost this season)
(I'd rather be a ghost this season)

I'd rather be a ghost this season
Disconnected, I don't like the feeling
Thoughts ricochet with the walls and the ceiling
My chest so tight, I can't even feel my breathing10Embed
