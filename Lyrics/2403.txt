Who’s Jimmy LyricsStop that start that gimme that
What you must be dizzy blood
Gimme that spot
Rolex sweep better gimme that watch
Boy in the corner this is my cotch
Remember the days way back when
Wiley was on stage ain't that when
Roll Deep, So Solid
Went at them It was heartless
Make 'em say boo inna ya head
Lyrics get shot then left man dead
Oh no ain't that the word
Never seen, never heard
Lyrics I burst killing a verse
Do it the worst spin it, reverse
Wheel it and come again
It's Jimmy Inkz and you know this
I got 21 seconds to flow this
So forward, forward
Pull up that forward
On my P and Qs
Like Kano
I be home sweet home
All day though, Delight fm
Pirate radio, Deja vu
Let me remind you dirty
That's how we play though
So boy better know that I'm serious
So well well well It's a shutdown
When you hear this
I be like nah nah nah
Don't waste my time just pay me a cheque
Cos I bar bury man like Konan
You could never walk in my Krept
Took the long way home best mind
Where you step just mind what you wish for
Mind what you get put in what you get out
Or take what you get sleep with
One eye open but I never slept more fire
Gimme a spliff get more higher
Cos I and I Jah Rastafari
Want peace and love for all Iyah
Who's Jimmy
Who's Jimmy
Who's Jimmy
I'm not Ghetto but I make
The gyal dem sing for me
Pow Lethal when B
Get the ting from me
She let her G
Pull strings like a symphony
How was I to know
That your chick had a thing for me
She can get the D no Flirta
Am I gonna bang I won't hurt her
If she wanna work let me work her
I can tell from her back
She a twerker
I be like bow, bow
Bow, bow for the reload
It's hype hype ish
Here where we go
Cos it's too many man
Too many man that we know fly like a plane
From Heathrow
There was tings in boots
Like Tinchy
Real OG like footsie
It was Crazy Titch and
Durrty Goodz, D Double E
Before Chip made Oopsy
Kids in hoods but no action
Bare rebores
Mans pack grew up in ends
By Clapham if man had beef
Then you back 'em
Old school days, way back then
Risky Roads, way back then
Private caller, way back then
MSN, way back then
3310, way back then
One 2 One, way back then
Sidewinder way back then
Eskimo, way back then
Jimmy
I'm not new to the game
Nine years rappin'
Guess I'm new to the fame
Check the stamina
The kid go strong
This is rap viagra
The kid flow long
Believe me I want respect for my thoughts
What would life be like if I didn't have a cause
I'm so great spit my verse
Put your game on pause
The rap God in the physical form
And I'm destined to be the greatest
So why am I underrated
My talent's apparent
So why am I so really hated
Stay sneaky, stay sly on the low
Stay watching my style and watching my flow
Put the game on my shoulder
Move like a solider
Nobody can't harm me
One man army take the game and run
'Til I can't run no more
Tired of being broke
Can't rap for fun no more
