Adore You Lyrics[Verse 1: NAO]
You're giving me fever
You're making the pressure rise at night right through my veins
You're making my heart sing
You're making my voice reach places that it's never been
No, no, no, no
You're making me weak, yeah
My mind's awake all night daydreaming
When will you be mine?
You're making my sleep wait
Thinking of you is taking all my nights away-way-way
[Chorus: NAO]
I really do adore you
Oh, lovely
I really do adore you, you, you, you
Oh, lovely
Oh, I really do adore

[Post-Chorus: Abhi Dijon]
And I adore you too
I've been thinking that your love's kinda special
You should know that I love and adore you too

[Verse 2: NAO]
Missing you at night
You're my addiction, so compulsive, it's my right
I'm drowning in your smile
You're so contagious, spreading through me
Got my fever up all night
And I can feel you through the night air, moving through me
I can't fight it
You're my obsession, intoxicated
And you know that you do this to me
Cast your spell so you can rule me, surrender to you

[Chorus 2: NAO]
My lovely
I really do adore you
My lovely
I really do adore you, you, you, you
Oh, my lovely, yeah
I really do adore you, you, you, you
I really adore you, hey
You might also like[Bridge: NAO]
You're my night time, you're my daytime
Sun, moon, and rain, do-do-do
I really adore you, oh
I really do adore

[Post-Chorus: Abhi Dijon]
And I adore you too
I've been thinking that your love's kinda special
You should know that I love and adore you too

[Outro: NAO]
Adore you
Adore you
Adore you
Adore you
Adore you
Adore you
