Astral Plane (High As Me) Lyrics[Intro]
Who get high as me?
Who get high as me? I'ma fail test (Uno, I killed it)
Who get high as me? I'ma fail test (Uno, I killed it)
(Dream, this shit go dummy)
What? What?

[Chorus]
Who get high as me? I don't—
Who get high as me? I don't know the answer
Baby just put some molly in her teeth, then pulled down her panties
Rickys, not Bottegas on my feet, I am not a dancer (Yeah)
Who get high as me? I'm on Perc' and Xannies
Sippin' on lean, I get high when I sleep, now I'm in a trance
I just put a opp on a tee, R.I.P. his mans
And I'm seein' codeine when I pee (Ha)
[Verse 1]
Codeine in my piss, I'ma fail test
Walk inside the trap like, "Cut the shit, where the bales at?"
Quagen in the Mist, can you feel that?
Lamborghini Urus and some Tris, where my L's at?
I can tell he re-rockin' the mix, I can smell that (Dummy, swear)
Who get high as me? I can't tell, yeah
Three tens, that's a thirty, huh, RPs and some dirty, huh (Whew)
My partner get so high that I get worried for him
Throw up, throw up (Ugh)
I think this nigga sick because his drugs cut
Body feelin' heavy, head might blow up (Yeah)
Who get high as me? Yeah, no one (Let's go)

[Chorus]
Who get high as me? I don't—
Who get high as me? I don't know the answer
Baby just put some molly in her teeth, then she pulled her panties
Rickys, not Bottegas on my feet, I am not a dancer (Swear)
Who get high as me? I'm on Perc' and Xannies
Sippin' on lean, I get high when I sleep, now I'm in a trance
I just put a opp on a tee, R.I.P. his mans
And I'm seein' codeine when I pee (Ha, lit, lit)

[Verse 2]
She on pink molly goin' crazy
Niggas pointin' fingers, bitch, we pointin' lasers
In some Ricky shit, feel like Darth Vader
Pull up, ten sticks, hoppin' out that Escalade
Please don't ask me what's in my cup
These niggas lookin' burnt out, they lost to the drugs
Know I'm havin' clean work, like, take me to the plug
I just hope this bean work, like, turn me up
Shorty said she lit, she on ten, I'm on ten (Ten)
Tell me that she wanna do some acid with her friend (Yeah)
Seen my vibe was lit (Lit), she tryna get in
She see I ain't flexin' on the 'net like I'm Kevin Durant
Baby girl want that drug sex, fuckin' on top of the Benz
Thinkin' I'm feelin' her spirit or maybe I'm in a trance (Trance)
I can see these haters' aura through these Cartier lens (Their aura)
Every time she pickin' whores, just wanna feel my skin (Whore, let's go, let's go)

Who get high as me? I don't— (What?)
Who get high as me? I don't know the answer
Baby just put some molly in her teeth, then she pulled her panties
Rickys, not Bottegas on my feet, I am not a dancer (Swear)
Who get high as me? I'm on Perc' and Xannies
Sippin' on lean, I get high when I sleep, now I'm in a trance
I just put a opp on a tee, R.I.P. his mans
And I'm seein' codeine when I pee (Ha)4Embed
