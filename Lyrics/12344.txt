Breaking Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
You used to be so fearless
You used to be so strong
What ever happened to the one that could do no wrong
How did you get so careless
How did you get so numb
Are you the only lie you're running from

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eye, I know I'm watching you drown
I wish that I could save you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eyes, I know deep inside
That holding you up
Holding you up is breaking me down
[Verse 2]
You don't gotta be perfect
You're not too far gone
But if you can't help yourself then you won't move on
The world's not out of focus
It's just what you've become
Don't you see that you're the lie you're running from?

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eye, I know I'm watching you drown
I wish that I could save you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eyes, I know deep inside
That holding you up
Holding you up is breaking me down

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eye, I know I'm watching you drown
I wish that I could save you
I wish that I could start by cutting you out
'Cause when I look in your eyes, I know deep inside
That holding you up
Holding you up is breaking me downYou might also likeEmbed
