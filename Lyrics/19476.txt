I Hope This Lasts Lyrics[Verse 1]

Got that crazy kinda love
You know, one stable
Musta busta busted like three tables
Baby, shake what god gave you
Scratchin' on my back like a turn table
I say you're the addict
Girl, you always pull up
Make a clap up down like you doin' pull-ups
Every time we fuck
I know that I'm in love
I won't ever hurt you
You been through enough
[Verse 2]

Do you like it rough, baby?
Cos I do
You huff three lines like you wrote a haiku
I know you like the "Party Guest" one
Me too
So we can do whatever freaky shit you wanna do
I ain't never met someone like you
Ain't nobody make me feel thе way you feel
Make me wanna get on onе knee
Share a last name with me
Just so I can go and show you it's real

[Bridge]

I won't sell you dreams
I won't tell you lies
I'll always have your back
If you got mine
You always make it feel like the first time
You my little California sunshine

[Chorus]

I don't wanna take it slow
I like it when it's fast
You got me so high
But I ain't prepared to crash
I hope this lasts
(I hope this lasts)
I think it will
(I think it will)
But if it don't
(But if it don't)
I love you still
You have my heart
You always will
(you always will)
You might also like[Verse 3]

Got that crazy kinda love
You know, one say
Got me out thinkin' maybe I could even change
When I get you home, I ain't tryna wait
Tryna fuck you in like, fifty different kinda ways
Aye
You got something that you know I like
That pretty peach and I just wanna bite
I might say "I love you" if you'll write
You're my Lois Lane in kryptonite

[Verse 4]

Got me so weak in the knees
If you movin' too fast, baby I like speed
Turn my little black book
Something I can't read
I bet your exes too straight
But they not like me

You the one I want, one I need
You're my vice, my drug, my nicotine
We both know
You out my league
And know I ain't playin no games
Unless you on my team
So
[Bridge]

I won't sell you dreams
I won't tell you lies
I'll always have your back
If you got mine
You always make it feel like the first time
You my little California sunshine

[Chorus]

I don't wanna take it slow
I like it when it's fast
You got me so high
But I ain't prepared to crash
I hope this lasts
(I hope this lasts)
I think it will
(I think it will)
But if it don't
(But if it don't)
I love you still
You have my heart
You always will
(you always will)Embed
