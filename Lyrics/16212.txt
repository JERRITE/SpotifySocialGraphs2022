TranslationsTürkçeHey Stupid, I Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nothing's wrong, and it's not what I'm used to
Oh, does it surprise you too?
When it's simple, is it easier than it should be?
Nothing's wrong, but when you're not in my arms
I send voice notes, you send hearts
And get quiet, and I know that means you miss me

[Refrain]
You're jealous, you shouldn't be
I want you obsessively
But I know how complicated it can get
When you're not in front of me
I know insecurities get in your head
[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it
Roll my eyes, get offended by the way you doubt it
You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes
So promise me you won’t
And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't
Hey stupid, I love you
Hey stupid, I love you

[Verse 2]
Nothing's wrong, I just get in my head too
Can you reassure me you, you're still in it?
I just wish you could lean in and kiss me
Say nothing's wrong, tell me to settle down
You do it better than I've ever known how
Won't pull some tricks for attention
But could I get a little now?

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it
Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it
You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes
So promise me you won’t
And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't
Hey stupid, I love you
Hey stupid, I love you
You might also like[Refrain]
You're jealous, you shouldn't be
I want you obsessively
But I know how complicated it can get
When you're not in front of me
I know insecurities get in your head

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it
Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it
You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes
So promise me you won’t
And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't
Hey stupid, I love you
Hey stupid, I love you

[Outro]
How could you forget?
I told you seventeen times before 7 AM
I love you
How could you forget?
I told you seventeen times
Hey stupid, I love you
How could you forget?
I told you seventeen times before 7 AM
I love you
How could you forget?
I told you seventeen times
Hey stupid, I love you5Embed
