Boyish Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your boyish reassurance is not reassuring
And I need it
And all of my devotion turns violent
If you go to her, don't expect to come home to me
To me

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off in general
So here we are, we're just two losers
I want you and you want something more beautiful
[Verse 2]
Lack of inhibition works wonders in revealing every demon
And all this confrontation, this suffering
What do you want from me?
If you don't like how I look, then leave

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
You can't get yours off the hostess
Watched her lips reserving tables
As my ugly mouth kept running

[Outro]
Love me
