Make You Feel Like Lyrics[Verse 1]
You may feel bad trying to lock me down
In the middle stuck between good times
All these long nights and the lack of sleep
In these nights [?]

[Chorus]
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
To make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
To make you feel like this
[Verse 2]
My anxiety is holding me back
But only lowkey
Still I'm drunk texting in high speed
Dragging me back to November
For the third time
Oh, it's a shame that our honeymoon [?]

[Chorus]
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
To make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
To make you feel like this

[Bridge]
It didn't seem so far away
And I've been searching for the longest time
Don't keep me waiting like you did before
How can I know when this is coming for

[Chorus]
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
That make you feel like this
I wanna be the only one
To make you feel like thisYou might also likeEmbed
