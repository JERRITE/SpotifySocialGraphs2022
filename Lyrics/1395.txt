​talk me out of it Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blue, the lights we were under
When you took your phone out
And gave me your number
Now it's two
We've asked all the questions
We've done all the small talk
Now there's nothing left except

[Pre-Chorus]
Taking shots, sharing lines
And spilling truth, oh
I wonder if you're gonna try to make a move
A move
[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm ‘bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talkin' me outta it
My friends are leavin' the party
But I'm down for one more drink
It's my first time in this outfit (Oh)
But maybe you'll talk mе out of it
Was gonna slow it down a bit
But you can talk me out of it
So talk me out of it

[Verse 2]
Your eyеs, there's somethin' in your stare
How they're sayin' the things your lips wouldn't dare
No, and I, I won't say it's workin'
But right now, I'm thinkin' that you might be worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
Taking shots, sharing lines
And spilling truth, oh (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I wonder if you're gonna try and make a move (Makin' a move, yeah)
A move (Makin' a move, yeah)

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm ‘bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talkin' me out of it
My friends are leavin' the party
But I'm down for one more drink (I'm down for it)
It's my first time in this outfit
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
Was gonna slow it down a bit
But you can talk me out of it
So talk me out of it (Now)

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm ‘bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talkin' me outta it
My friends are leavin' the party
But I'm down for one more drink
It's my first time in this outfit (My first time in it)
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
Was gonna slow it down a bit (Gonna slow it down)
But you can talk me out of it
‘Cause I'm ‘bout to go to my apartment
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you could keep talkin' me outta it

So talk me out of it (Now)Embed
