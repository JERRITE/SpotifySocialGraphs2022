Lesson Learned Lyrics[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
He broke my heart
And now it's raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy 'bout it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down, no
[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & (Alicia Keys)]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Sometimes
Some lies can take a minute
To fully realize his tears, your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racin' to the door
Can't take it anymore
You might also like[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You oughta see me now

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned
Whoa
Said yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Said, mistakes overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned, oh, lesson learned
Oh, another lesson learned
[Outro: John Mayer]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
A lesson learned
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright6Embed
