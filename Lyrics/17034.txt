Follow Through Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
You know what I mean?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And we can build through this destruction
As we are standing on our feet

[Chorus]
So, since you wanna be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
[Verse 2]
These reeling emotions, they just keep me alive
They keep me in tune
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
This is for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am I too obvious to preach it?
You're so hypnotic on my heart

[Chorus]
So, since you wanna be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through

[Bridge]
The words you say to me are unlike anything
That's ever been said
Oh, and what you do to me is unlike anything
That's ever been
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am I too obvious to preach it?
You're so hypnotic on my heart

[Chorus]
Ooh, so, since you wanna be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you every day
So, since you wanna be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
You're gonna have to follow, oh

[Outro]
This is the start of something good
Don't you agree?Embed
