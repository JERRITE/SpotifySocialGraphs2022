Rather Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can touch the planets through the roof of my car
You're reaching for the heavens, only bark at the stars
Now all your hundred thousands best remember my name
I'd sucker punch an army if they got in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to kill 'em, now I'm
Wipin' the spit from my eyes
I take a beating, but I
I'll never give up
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather

[Verse 2]
I'm a kamikaze, you're just turnin' me on
So light 'em up or smoke 'em like a nuclear bomb
Know sooner or later you'll be singin' along
(like ah nanananananana nana)

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to kill 'em, now I'm
Wipin' the spit from my eyes
I take a beating, but I
I'll never give up

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather

[Bridge]
You see me shooting through the heavens like a holy laser
My powers of deduction cut you like your mornin' razor
And if you want it like I want it, guess I'll see you later
'Cause Jesus made me outta flesh, and I'm a fornicator

You see me shooting through the heavens like a holy laser
My powers of deduction cut you like your mornin' razor
And if you want it like I want it, guess I'll see you later
'Cause Jesus made me outta

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather

Oh, oh, I think I'd rather die
I think I'd rather die
I think I'd ratherEmbed
