Rise Up 2k16 LyricsMy dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
Eh... eh...

Rise up
Don't falling down again
Rise up
Love like I broke the chains
I tried to fly a while so high
Direction: sky!
I tried to fly a while so high
Direction: sky!

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
Eh...

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
We'll be the game
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
For my mind and my brain

'Cause I tried to fly a while so high
Direction: sky!
I tried to fly so high
Direction: sky!

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
Eh... eh... eh... eh... eh...You might also likeEmbed
