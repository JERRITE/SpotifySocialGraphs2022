Dance Me If You Can Lyrics[Verse 1: Gita]
Are you sure that you're up for this?
Do you think you can handle it?
(It's complicated, you might get frustrated)

We got the moves that you've neva' seen
Let me show you just what I mean
(There's really no chance that you can do our dance)

[Pre-Chorus: Gita]
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no
(Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah)
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no
Oh no, uh-uh, uh-uh
Oh no, show me what you got

[Chorus: Gita]
Try to follow, watch me, now
If you think that you know how
Then dance me (Dance me)
Dance me if you can (Dance me if you can)
Get it together, or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me
Dance me if you can (Dance me if you can)
Oh!

[Interlude: Gita]
Dance me if you can
Dance me (Dance me)
Dance me if you can

[Verse 2: Dorinda, Chanel, & Aqua]
I know that you think you're in control
But watch and learn, 'cause this is how we roll
Work it just like this
Let's see you try and do that
What's the matter?
Can't you figure it out?
Cause you look confused, mixed up, no doubt
There's really no chance that you can do our dance

(C'mon, c'mon)
Yeah, yeah
(Show me what you got)

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls & (Chanel)]
Try to follow, watch me, now (Oh)
If you think that you know how
Then dance me (Dance me)
Dance me if you can (Oh, yeah)
Get it together, or fall apart (Uh-huh)
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me (Dance me)
Dance me if you can (Yeah)

If you think you got what it takes
Then dance me (Oh) (Dance me)
Dance me if you can (Dance me if you can)Embed
