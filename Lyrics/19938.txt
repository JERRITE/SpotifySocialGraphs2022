Stay Alive Lyrics[Intro]
MTM hit em with the heat

[Chorus: Bexey]
Stay alive for me
And I’ll stay alive for you
Would you even cry for me?
Because I would die for you
Just look me in my eyes
So I know it's real
Hypnotize my mind
Rearranging my world
Stay alive for me
And I’ll stay alive for you
Would you even cry for me?
Because I would die for you
Just look me in my eyes
So I know it's real
Hypnotize my mind
Rearranging my world
[Refrain: Bexey]
And I'ma break your heart
If you fucking with my head
Baby, I’ll tear you apart
You leave me for dead
You playing my love
Questioning what I said
I’ll never regret
I won’t ever forget

[Verse: Fat Nick]
I got big guns on me (Pew—pew)
Need me more codeine
Come and test my gangster
You can see this green beam (Pew-pew)
All I drink is lean (Yeah)
Watch my liver bleed
And I can never trust a soul
So I keep this pole on me
Keep a few bags on me now (Yeah)
Suck my dick, hoe, you can leave now (Now)
My diamond wet shining like wow now (Now)
I'm way too fucked up
I can't slow down

[Refrain: Bexey]
And I'ma break your heart
If you fucking with my head
Baby, I’ll tear you apart
You leave me for dead
You playing my love
Questioning what I said
I’ll never regret
I won’t ever forget

Stay alive for me
And I’ll stay alive for you
Would you even cry for me?
Because I would die for you
Just look me in my eyes
So I know it's real
Hypnotize my mind
Rearranging my world
Stay alive for me
And I’ll stay alive for you
Would you even cry for me?
Because I would die for you
Just look me in my eyes
So I know it's real
Hypnotize my mind
Rearranging my world22Embed
