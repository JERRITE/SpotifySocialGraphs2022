Roc the Mic Lyrics[Intro: Beanie Sigel & Freeway]
Ho! Ho!
Bounce
Holla!
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Chyeah, ugh
[Chorus: Beanie Sigel & Freeway]
It's B. Sig' in the place with Young Free (Free, Sigel)
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right (On this one)
Still watch what you say out your mouth (Chyeah, chyeah)
'Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out (Yo, yo)
[Verse 1: Freeway & Beanie Sigel]
I miss the hood when I'm traveling (Ugh)
Get neck when I'm traveling
Chicks peck wood when I'm traveling
Fuck a Lex 'cause the clique fit good in the Caravan (Ugh)
Slide through your hood like a avalanche
Click a flick if you get a chance, get that close
Fuck an advance, 'cause I get that dough (Get that dough)
Beef with me, enemies, come sleep with me
For breakfast, guaranteed to eat this toast
I'm reckless, firestarter heat your folks
A starving artist that'll eat y'all tracks, so don't bring 'em around
I be around Ricans—"vida loca"
They got all the toasters, don't need no gats
I got a six stashed, leave 'em around
So I don't get left around haters
Around when I leave in the winter
Rock short sleeves—reason? The pound
With the heat blasting, keep acting
The heat blasting, Techno-Marine shining
Marine fashion, backing 'em down
Niggas gon' keep hating, and my clique gon' keep grinding
Keep moving, locking the town (Free!)

[Chorus: Freeway & Beanie Sigel]
It's Freeway in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still, watch what you say to me, prick
'Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip
It's B. Sig' in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still watch what you say out your mouth
'Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!

It's Mack, daddy; young, scrappy (Ugh)
"No, he ain't the O.G. gangster" (Yes I is!)
Come on, don't test I, kid
I firebomb cribs like Left Eye did
(Notorious!) Like that Bed-Stuy kid, big or small, you can get it
"Dead Wrong," like tryna brawl or strong-arm a midget (Ugh)
I pull that nine out my pocket, I'm lying
I pull that Mac out the closet, start firing
For you cats outta pocket, stop trying
Take that, get back, clap iron
You know, stay low, keep firing, ugh!
I put the lead in the gat, the metal go clap
I lay cats flat on they back
Stop fucking with this radical cat
You fuck around and need a medical cap
The lead'll go clap, your head'll go back (Ugh)
It's B. Sig' in the place to be
With two heaters on the waist of me, man, who facing me?

[Chorus: Beanie Sigel & Freeway]
It's B. Sig' in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still, watch what you say out your mouth
'Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!
It's Freeway in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still, watch what you say to me, prick
'Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip
[Verse 3: Freeway & Beanie Sigel]
Big nickels down your way, don't trip (Don't trip)
Get folded down your way, got soldiers down your way
Keep quiet down your way, no lip (Ugh)
All of y'all need to run yourself
Go get the burner, nigga, bang yourself
'Fore I come through with the hammer, make you lose your health
Fast, roll with Dash, us move like Cassius Clay
Move yay' like caskets
There's a will, there's a way
Obey my thirst, move yay' through traffic
Without Sprite, yo, without Nikes
I "Just Do It"—ball, break the basket
Yeah, you damn right, without ice
I pull up to your honey car and stuff her basket (Ah)
International post player, circle the atlas
You don't wanna be ho-playas, circle the hood
Bend over backwards when I search 'em for Backwoods

[Chorus: Freeway & Beanie Sigel]
It's Freeway in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still, watch what you say to me, prick
'Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah
Still, watch what you say out your mouth
'Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!
It's Freeway in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah!
Still, watch what you say to me, prick
'Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right, yeah
Still, watch what you say out your mouth
'Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!

[Bridge: Freeway]
All of y'all need to run yourself
Go get the burner, nigga, bang yourself
All of y'all need to run yourself
Go get the burner, nigga, bang yourself

[Break: Freeway]
Chyeah, chyeah (Ho! Ho!)
It's the—It's the Roc, nigga! (Ho! Ho!)
Ho! (Rrrrr)
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
And another one, and another one...

[Bridge (to fade): Freeway, Beanie Sigel, & Both]
All of y'all need to run yourself
Go get the burner, nigga, bang yourself
All of y'all need to run yourself (Brrrat!)
Go get the burner, nigga, bang yourselfEmbed
