Cocaine Sunday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never making love again
There's too much pain inside my head
Feeling insecure
I don't know what for
You have to tell me
You have to tell me now
I'm a waste of time
I said I'd never lie
And then I come home
With truth you don't wanna know
I was high on coke
I should have never cheated
[Chorus]
'Cause now I wanna die
Commit suicide
You said that I'm addicted to pain
I guess you were right
I guess you were right
So right

[Verse 2]
Are you still in love?
I ask you every night
Are you meant for me?
'Cause all you do is fight
Everything I did was wrong
Everything you said was right
So right
Everything I did was wrong
Everything you said was right
So right, so right
So dark inside

[Chorus]
That's why I wanna die
Commit suicide
You said that I'm addicted to pain
I guess you were right
I guess you were right
So rightYou might also likeEmbed
