But I need a bag (I need a bag)

Make sure that it's fat like a pillow, I'ma need it on the dash (On my dash)
Hide it in my stash (Stash)

[Verse 2]
I need you to sell me a bag that make me like I'm around (What?)
Make me feel like I'm in outer space (Pluto)
I don't like these bitches in my face (Fuck outta here)
Turnin' heads, make a 360 (Yeah)
Y'all niggas can't fuck wit' me (Fuck it up)
Doing blow off the car key (No)
Trade in here, tryna gawk me (Yeah)
Performing every day in a different city
Gotta keep the work always with me
All I need is a nice bag
Nice price for some nice cash
Poppin' tags like a white lad
Holy mountain with the white fags
Throw a 40 off the rooftop
Lemonade like Guwap
I'ma just run like 2 blocks
Get a nigga shot like 2Pac

No, not in 30 minutes bitch, I need it now (Right fuckin' now)
Just gimme a round (Yah)
