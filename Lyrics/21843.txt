Our Story Lyrics[Verse]
Take a look past our innocence
Take a step back to yesterday
When life would move slower, we would never grow up
All we knew that love was for when we're older
Anything could happen, secretly imagine
They could never tear us apart, too young to fall

[Chorus]
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our lonely glory, that we could get back they say
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our hope if only, we could take back some day
[Verse]
Take a look past our innocence
Take a step back to yesterday
When life would move slower, we would never grow up
All we knew that love was for when we're older
Anything could happen, secretly imagine
They could never tear us apart too young to fall

[Chorus]
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our lonely glory, that we could get back they say
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our hope if only, we could take back some day

[Verse]
Take a look past our innocence
Take a step back to yesterday
When life would move slower, we would never grow up
All we knew that love was for when we're older
Anything could happen, secretly imagine
They could never tear us apart too young to fall

[Chorus]
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our lonely glory, that we could get back they say
This is our story, that we could take back some day
Our hope if only, we could take back some dayYou might also like4Embed
