Gold and Bones Lyrics[Intro]
So what if I'm wasted?
Or dreaming baby don't go changing
Let me feel the light
Let me feel

[Verse 1]
Tonight she's wearing gold and bones and eager eyes
I already know, I already know that I can't fight
She makes me wanna do wrong
She makes being bad feel so damn right
But not in this light
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she says she'll change but I don't want that
Matter fact I'll never look back
Your change ain't gonna cure what ails me

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once I feel alive
'Cause hell let's face it we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God I'm satisfied

[Verse 2]
And for the thousandth time
You can walk all over me
As we toe the line
Between feeling alive and feeling fine

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't beg and I won't look back
'Cause somewhere deep I know you want that
I'm patient but patience ain't what gonna make it alright

[Chorus]
Oh, maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once I feel alive
'Cause hell let's face it we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God I'm satisfied

Satisfied
Let me feel

[Chorus]
So, maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once I feel alive
'Cause hell let's face it we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God I'm satisfied1Embed
