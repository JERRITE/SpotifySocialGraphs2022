Girl of Your Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been drinking in a shit club
Holy heaven, I've been messed up
And I tell you the truth
Every night that I do I sit and drink about you
And I've been getting under
In the hope of getting over
But tell me what is the use
'Cause everytime that I do I lie and think about you

[Pre-Chorus]
One bad habit, they call me an addict
I'm too damn tragic to be this romantic
A three word panic that I keep on hidin' from you
[Chorus]
I can be what you want, I can be what you need
Anytime that you like, do whatever you please
I can be the girl of your dreams
You are all that I want, you are all that I need
And I know what you like, don't you see that it's me
I can be the girl of your dreams

[Verse 2]
Frustration
Can we cut the conversation?
Your heart is a little undressed
'Cause this is way more than sex, you've got it all to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you're one bad habit, they call me an addict
I'm too damn tragic to be this romantic
A three word panic that I keep on hidin' from you, from you

[Chorus]
I can be what you want, I can be what you need
Anytime that you like, do whatever you please
I can be the girl of your dreams
You are all that I want, you are all that I need
And I know what you like, don't you see that it's me
I can be the girl of your dreams
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
One bad habit, they call me an addict
I'm too damn tragic to be this romantic
A three word panic that I keep on hidin' from you

[Chorus]
(Be what you)
I can be what you want, I can be what you need (Ah)
Anytime that you like, do whatever you please
I can be the girl of your dreams (The girl of your, the girl of your)
You are all that I want, you are all that I need
And I know what you like, don't you see that it's me
I can be the girl of your dreams
(The girl of your, the girl of your dreams)

[Outro]
I can be the girl of your dreams (The girl of your dreams)
I can be the girl of your dreamsEmbed
