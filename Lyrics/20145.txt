​room to breathe Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm kinda glad I won’t talk to you again
Should've seen the red flags just a few weeks in
Yeah, I thought for once maybe something could go right
Guess I'm just stuck in this low point in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasted so much energy and wasted so much time
This was just a game to you, how could I be so blind?
Now I’m just ashamed, should've seen through all the lies
Wish I wasn't gullible and desperate, intertwined
[Chorus]
I need some clarity
I need some room to breathe
You made a cut
You cut me deep and let me bleed
I need some clarity
I need some room to breathe
You made a cut
You cut me deep and let me bleed

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I should've known
I'm better off alone
Just please don't hit my phone
Just please don't hit my phone

[Verse 2]
Ignorance is safe, I found bliss in a dead end
Why did I hold on when I knew this would happen?
I needed a wake up call, I should've seen the signs
Trying not to go insane so please don’t hit my line

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasted so much energy and wasted so much time
This was just a game to you, how could I be so blind?
Now I’m just ashamed, should've seen through all the lies
Wish I wasn’t gullible and desperate, intertwined

I need some clarity
I need some room to breathe
You made a cut
You cut me deep and let me bleed
I need some clarity
I need some room to breathe
You made a cut
You cut me deep and let me bleed

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I should've known
I'm better off alone
Just please don't hit my phone
Just please don’t hit my phone
Yeah, I should've known
I'm better off alone
Just please don't hit my phone
Just please don't hit my phone5Embed
