Just The Same Lyrics[Verse 1]
Smash all the pictures where I am in the frame
Toy with my emotions as if it is a game
In the heat of the moment, call someone else's name
I would love you just the same

[Verse 2]
Drag me through the dirt
Cut me to the bone
Leave me for dead and laugh your way back home
I'd still be smiling like a madman in the rain
And I would love you just the same
[Chorus]
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction
Of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I still love you just the same

[Verse 3]
Flog me with malice 'til the rivers running red
Make me an outlaw
Put a price upon my head
Cast me to exile or a house for the insane
And I would love you just the same

[Chorus]
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction
Of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I still love you just the sameYou might also like5Embed
