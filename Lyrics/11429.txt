Tried So Hard LyricsAnd you tried so hard to get there…
And you tried so hard to get there…

Must be a way
For you to make the big time
You gotta lay
The lady at the right time
There'll come a day
For drinken all the sky wine
You only say
You're waiting for the right time
There'll come a time
Just try & try against
You who believe
You who believe

You believe that you can take or leave my love for you
You believe that you are free to choose what you can do
You believe that feelin' nothin' make you wise & strong
Tell me that what makes me love you also makes me wrong

Look at me
Look at you
Look at all the people

I am not free I am not free
A hand flutters in my brain
Silken cords trembling into the waterfall
Where the wise brown frog
Gives princely advice
But not to you or I

Who ? You who belive

And you tried so hard to get there…
And you tried so hard to get there…You might also likeEmbed
