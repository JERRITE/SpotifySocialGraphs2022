​highschool (remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: ​guccihighwaters]
I used to be cool, I used to be new
Just like you told me, that time in school
We could cut class, we could hold hands
We could go to prom, but I can't really dance
You used to let me copy 'cause I would never study
You used to text me every day and tell me I was funny
I was the shy kid, sitting in silence
Frown on my face, pick me up, keep me smiling

[Chorus: ​guccihighwaters]
I met you in the summer, everything I wanted
After time passed, started feeling likе a puppet
You can throw me away, when thе colors fade
I'll be back in your arms on another day
I met you in the summer, everything I wanted
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet
You can throw me away, when the colors fade
I'll be back in your arms on another day
[Verse 2: ​guccihighwaters]
Then you got new friends, left the old ones
But the new ones, not the best ones
You said that you met one at your college
He's an alcoholic if we're really being honest
They don't really care about you like I do
And every time I tell you that, you think I'm tryna fight you
I'm not tryna fight you, take me back to high school
You said you wanna die, I guess I'ma say goodbye too

[Bridge: convolk]
Let go of my head, I'm better off alone
Let go of my chest, I'll never feel at home
Let go of my head, I'm better off alone
Let go of my chest, I'll never feel at home

[Verse 3: convolk]
I used to see you every day, now I spend every day without you
Crushed piano keys, I'm on my knees, about to pray about you
But I've been thinking 'bout how every day is just a day without you
I was the shy kid sitting in silence

[Chorus: ​guccihighwaters & convolk]
I met you in the summer, everything I wanted
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet
You can throw me away, when the colors fade
I'll be back in your arms on another day
I met you in the summer, everything I wanted
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet
You can throw me away, when the colors fade
I'll be back in your arms on another dayYou might also like5Embed
