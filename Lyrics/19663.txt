FAME LyricsFame

Splash, splatter at the mad rappers
Spilling liquor, got a bad habit
Put your money back son
I'd rather shat a little whack dreams
And your chitter chatter really isn't mattering
The couple dougies, cook her fuck her up and put them on a platter
Fucking jay you dela, son is small and fatter
I be lankey taller, and we balling passing
Rhythm off with a bat
Lot of motherfuckers all talk on the track
This apocalypse, rap smash they all whack
Put them off the map, we laugh on
Let the bottles crack, I let them swallow sack
While I swallow the jack, I'm a little pass my limit
I'm hollering madness in the whip mashing
Hundred five on the dash, cut the grass low
Fin the killer snake ass
Fame, get that money so it ain't a problem
So the bitches holler for the fame
Double your cup, what? Get your buzz up
You know that you bugging for fame
This what they want right?
This what they want right?
Give them that raw life, fame
Give them that raw life, fame
But that's tell them all

Level headed, never fallen from grace
Fame, never fallen from grace
Swallow truth and spit it back in they face
Fame, spit it back in they face
I never had it, never fallen from grace
Fame, never fallen from grace
Swallow truth and spit it back in they face
Fame, spit it back in they face

Fuck with this
I'm in the club and they bump my shit
Your bitch love my hits
Chillin feelin jiggy wit' a bittie u talkin bout gettin' greedy
Never showin' opposition any pity
I ain't talkin' a lot, but you know i'm runnin' the city
I ain't one to attack, u know dat my clique is with me
Back of da lac, we rollin' some of that sticky weed a bomb
Throwin' hunnids and fifties there ain't no takin' it wit me when i'm gone
YES, THIS cinema vision is comin' strong
Sweater weather whippin' the benz, I think not
Came a long way from the hallway
Get it how I live it I'm driven to kill it always
All day, we ain't never takin off days
Get the money while the song plays
I minaj puts a couple of broads I call a foreplay
Ridin' like a saddle no caddle like on a horseplay
You might also likeFame, get that money so it ain't a problem
So the bitches holler for the fame
Double your cup, what? Get your buzz up
You know that you bugging for fame
This what they want right?
This what they want right?
Give them that raw life, fame
Give them that raw life, fame
But that's tell them all

I never had it, never fallen from grace
Fame, never fallen from grace
Swallow truth and spit it back in they face
Fame, spit it back in they face
I never had it, never fallen from grace
Fame, never fallen from grace
Swallow truth and spit it back in they face
Fame, spit it back in they face2Embed
