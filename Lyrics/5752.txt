C’mon People (We’re Making It Now) [Rework] LyricsSometimes I feel like I can't move on
But then life is turning me on
But I still see clearly when I see you smilin'

You know when nothing seems to fit
I couldn't see my way through the shit

But every single second of my waking day
Was thinking of you, thinking of you
You never know that I am alive
I am alive, I wanna grow
And there are so many things I can do
Just like falling in love with you
Take my hand, now understand me
You can come here, too

C'mon people we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon people we're making it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But today I've worked it out
I've got something I can shout about
Someone who believes in all the things I'm thinkin'

But where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
I'll never know

For I am alive
I am alive, I wanna grow

And there are so many things I can do
Just like falling in love with you
So take my hand now, understand me
You can come here, too
