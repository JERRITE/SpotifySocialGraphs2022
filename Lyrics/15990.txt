Candy Store Lyrics[CHERYL]
Are we gonna have a problem?
Did zombies eat your brain?
You've come so far
Why now are you yanking on my chain?
I'd normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I'm feeling nice
Here's some advice
Listen up, biotch
[BETTY &VERONICA]
I like

[CHERYL]
Lookin' hot
Buying stuff they cannot

[BETTY &VERONICA]
I like

[CHERYL]
Drinkin' hard
Maxin' Dad's credit card

[BETTY &VERONICA]
I like

[CHERYL ]
Skippin' gym
Scaring her
Screwing him

[BETTY &VERONICA ]
I like

[CHERYL ]
Killer clothes
Kickin' nerds in the nose
You might also likeIf you lack the juice
Go play Duck, Duck, Goose
Let your mommy fix you ice cream

[BETTY &VERONICA]
Whoa

[CHERYL]
Or come hang with me
And tonight we'll be
Dirty dancing with the football team

[CHERYL, BETTY &VERONICA]
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

Honey, whatcha waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
It's time for you to prove
You're not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store

Guys fall

[BETTY]
At your feet
[VERONICA]
Pay the check
Help you cheat

[CHERYL]
All you

Need to know
Some dead weight
Has to go

[BETTY]
That freak's
Not your friend
I can tell in the end
If she
Had your shot
She would leave you to rot

[VERONICA]
'Course if you don't care
Fine, go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on
Whoa

[BETTY]
Or forget the creep

[VERONICA]
And get in my jeep

[CHERYL]
Let's go tear up someone's lawn

[TONI]
See, you don't have it
Watch this

[TONI & PEACHES]
Honey, whatcha waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove
You're not a doorknob anymore
Then step into my candy store

[CHERYL]
You can join the team

[TONI]
Or you can bitch and moan

[CHERYL]
You can live the dream

[TONI]
Or you can die alone

[CHERYL, BETTY &VERONICA ]
You can fly with eagles
Or if you prefer
Keep on testing me

[TONI & PEACHES]
And end up like her
Whoa
Honey, whatcha waitin' for?

[CHERYL]
Shut up, Toni!
Step into my candy store
Time for you to prove
You're not a lame ass anymore

[CHERYL & TONI]
Then step into my candy store
It's my candy store
It's my candy
It's my candy store
It's my candy
It's my candy store
It's my candy store3Embed
