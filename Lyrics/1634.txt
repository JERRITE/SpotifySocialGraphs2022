Curfew Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
My new girl is eighteen, still lying to her dad to see me (Yeah)
12:30 curfew, we'll be back believe me (Yeah)
You can measure how I'm feeling just by how she treat me
So all I need is the girls who need me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
My new girl is eighteen, still lying to her dad to see me (Yeah!)
12:30 curfew, we'll be back believe me (Yeah!)
You can measure how I'm feeling just by how she treat me
So all I need is the girls who need me
[Verse 1]
All I need is a woman who make a kid feel like he bulletproof (Yeah!)
Get my mind off whatever my ex put me through (Uh-huh)
She say I'm full of myself, she want me full of me too (Yeah!)
They gave the kid a foreign bitch, who thought my ego wouldn't boost? (Let's go!)
Hold up, let’s unpack it all (Yeah), my girl said I'm acting off (Yeah)
Told her I need time alone (Yeah), she know that ain't lasting long (Yeah)
I got me a new one, thicker with a thin core
Issues that are premature, I need girls who need me more (She need me more)
I use them as my crutch, shit, my mom knew it
But when you get her a house, you bring who you want to it (Bring in who I want!)
Momma want me to be smart, I ain't no college student (No!)
My bitch is (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
My new girl is eighteen, still lying to her dad to see me (Yeah)
12:30 curfew, we'll be back believe me (Yeah)
You can measure how I'm feeling just by how she treat me
So all I need is the girls who need me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
My new girl is eighteen, still lying to her dad to see me (Yeah)
12:30 curfew, we'll be back believe me (Yeah)
You can measure how I'm feeling just by how she treat me
So all I need is the girls who need me

[Verse 2]
She think I'm rich 'cause my passport full and my dashboard wooden (Yeah!)
Year into college actin' like a grown woman (Uh-huh)
Girl come give me action (Yeah!), young dumb passion (Yeah!)
Remind me of the youth I gave up for the rap shit (Oh!)
Know you lucky (Yeah), you should know you lucky (Yeah)
Throw it to me, catch the feelings, but don't show 'em to me (Yeah)
I'm the-I'm the boy, got a void, I think you could fill
Hate what music did to me, but shit, I love the music still
Ego is my downfall (Uh-huh), but it run my business (True)
Pick your poison, I'd be broke if I was humble with it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Twenty-one and gifted with a strong mind, fame, cash, long rides
Flights, girls, more pride
