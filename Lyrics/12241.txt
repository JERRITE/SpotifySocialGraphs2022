Bottom of a Bottle Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been scared and lonely
I've asked myself, is something wrong with you?
My girlfriend told me
I need some time alone to deal with issues

[Pre-Chorus]
But something makes me carry on
It's difficult to understand why I always wanna fly

[Chorus]
I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
Do it for the love
That I get from the bottom of a bottle
[Verse 2]
You always call me
And ask me how I make it through the day
I'm always fallin'
I guess it's just God's way of making me pay

[Pre-Chorus]
But something makes me carry on
It's difficult to understand why I always wanna fly

[Chorus]
I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
Do it for the love
That I get from the bottom of a bottle
I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
Do it for the love
That I get from the bottom of a bottle

[Bridge]
When I, I wonder why I try
And I, I wonder why I bother
And I, I wonder why I cry
Why I, I go through all this trouble
You might also like[Chorus]
I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
Do it for the love
That I get from the bottom of a bottle
I do it for the drugs
I do it just to feel alive
Do it for the love
That I get from the bottom of a bottle4Embed
