Pudge Rodriguez Lyrics[Intro: A$AP ANT]
Sounds spiritual

[Hook: A$AP ANT]
Smoke fee cost me $500, I'm still gonna light that bitch up in the coupe
Caught ya girl on Melrose, I roll down the window, I holla atcha boo
Nordstrom into my crib, but I know shit gone blow me like a flute
He make the music, I shoutout his shoes, look at my outfit this shit is expensive
Mike Jordans from back in the day be vintage
I got the Tris, and I'm still gonna tax you
Feeling like Danny, I pull up in Phantom
Put drip on her body, Dior on her sandals
[Verse 1: A$AP ANT]
Might get some earrings, I need some more diamonds
Rolls Royce truck big, I gotta climb in
Didn't expect me, the way that I'm stylin'
We go a hundred, and then they gon' find them
My diamonds so scary I call them Thе Shining
Money like spray, pollen?
Exclusivе you can't even find him
Tropical, pour up in Fanta
I give her fruit banana
I told her don't pull up with camera
Like Kool-Aid bitch I'm jam her
I treat her like mail, stamp her

[Hook: A$AP ANT]
Smoke fee cost me $500, I'm still gonna light that bitch up in the coupe
Caught ya girl on Melrose, I roll down the window, I holla atcha boo
Nordstrom into my crib, but I know shit gone blow me like a flute
He make the music, I shoutout his shoes, look at my outfit this shit is expensive
Mike Jordans from back in the day be vintage
I got the Tris, and I'm still gonna tax you
Feeling like Danny, I pull up in Phantom
Put drip on her body, Dior on her sandalsYou might also likeEmbed
