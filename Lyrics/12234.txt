Faceless Lyrics[Hook: Bladee]
Am I really crazy
Crazy for you, baby
Three grams to the face and now I'm feeling faceless
Ride around in L.A., shoot like I'm the mayor
Stay out of my way, could you do me a favor?
Smoking in the park, yeah, feelin' like a skater
Looking at me left, yeah, you look like a hater
I'm not gonna say much, I'ma say a prayer
Pull off in an Audi, I'ma see you later
[Verse 1: Kane Grocerys]
And you's know I've been patiently waiting 'fore I got to explode
All this fake beef, niggas better act like they know
On the front line prayed up, ready for war
Got them killers on the side of me, all my niggas hardcore
Sippin' lean I just scored, finna go and hit the stove
Now it's back to the yo, cookin' up, they want more
Got an album in stores, went overseas on tour
I was flying in different countries, waking up
Rocking shows, did it all for the culture
Gotta watch out for them vultures
From the blocks of horror
A lot of bloody fucking murders, mourn one, they get tortured
We shining over here, burning hot, bitch, we scorching
Told my girl I miss her when I'm touring

[Hook: Bladee]
Am I really crazy?
Crazy for you, baby
Three grams to the face and now I'm feeling faceless
Ride around in L.A., shoot like I'm the mayor
Stay out of my way, could you do me a favor?
Smoking in the park, yeah, feelin' like a skater
Looking at me left, yeah, you look like a hater
I'm not gonna say much, I'ma say a prayer
Pull off in an Audi, I'ma see you later

Don't call my phone, I'm gon' ignore it
Smoking three grams to the face, gas got me going
In my bag, I'm in my zone and you snow I'm zoning
Going ninety on the freeway, I ain't finna pull over
Fuck the motherfucking DEA, she ain't on the [?]
Gotta stack this money up, gotta feed my grans and mas
Pray everyday to Allah, thankful I made it this far
Paid the cost to be the boss, sometimes you gotta take loss
Ice boss, I floss, ice chains, they gloss
My bitch bad like Rosa Acosta
Ain't no stopping till the show is over
Stack the money till it's overflowing
Shyne Boyz, Drain Gang, and you snow how we coming
Got the .40, this bitch get to drumming
