​i met a boy online Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met a boy online
We talk all the time
He lives in my city and tells me I'm pretty
Does he know he lies?

[Verse 2]
I met a boy online
I wish he was mine
But it's just a distraction, it won't ever happen
He's wasting his time
[Chorus]
‘Cause what if he sees me in person and hates me like I do?
He'll pretend that it's not true
But it's always the same
Then I'll lie in my bed and go cry to my friends, it's a routine
‘Cause why would he want me
When I am this way?
Oh, why would he want me?

[Verse 3]
I met a boy online
He calls every night
Right when I need him and I get a feeling
He's reading my mind

[Verse 4]
And maybe he'll find out
What's feeding my doubts
See I've never felt wanted if I'm being honest
I don't know how

[Chorus]
And what if he sees me in person and hates me like I do?
He'll pretend that it's not true
But it's always the same
Then I'll lie in my bed and go cry to my friends, it's a routine
‘Cause why would he want me
When I am this way?
Oh
You might also like[Bridge]
I wish I could let you inside
Let you love me, let you love me, oh-oh
I wish I could change up my mind
And let you love me, let you love me, oh-oh

[Chorus]
But what if he sees me in person and hates me like I do?
Don't pretend that it's not true
But it's always the same
Then I'll lie in my bed and go cry to my friends
It's a routine
‘Cause why would he want me
When I am this way?
Oh

[Outro]
Why would he want me?
Why would he want me?
Why would he want me?Embed
