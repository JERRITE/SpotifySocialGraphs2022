FACEPLANT Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
I'm on my God shit, aye
Fuck you (XEROGI), aye
Fuck everybody else, man
FV, haha, aye
Aye

[Verse 1]
I'll put the blade in your mo'fucking face
If you don't give me space, I won't let you escape
Talk all that shit until FV involved
Put your face in the ground and ask, "How does it taste?"
I'll put the blade in your mo'fucking face
If you don't give me space, I won't let you escape
Talk all that shit until FV involved
Put your face in the ground, how does it taste?
[Chorus]
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing, yuh

[Verse 2]
Face-plant, bang in your head with my fist
Break my knuckles when I hit your ribs, I don't play, no
I'll rip your body apart with my fingertips
Bitch, I just want you to bleed, yuh
Licking my lips when I see your blood spilling
Yeah, I'm finna kill 'em with ease, yuh
Better bow down, I told all of you peasants
That I am the motherfucking king
I am convinced I'm a God
You cannot tell me I'm not
I am convinced I'm a God
You cannot tell me I'm not
I am convinced I'm a God
You cannot tell me I'm not
I am convinced I'm a God
You cannot tell me I'm not

Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing
Face-plant, I make 'em face-plant
I let my blade swing, yuh5Embed
