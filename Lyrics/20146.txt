I’m good at Being Lonely Can’t You Tell Lyrics[Intro]
Damn, I'm such a hopeless case
If you don't like me then I get it

[Verse]
Hey, here's a recap
Anxiety been drilling through my head
Been hard to relax (Still hard to relax)
Wait, I want a clear head
I've been walking 'round my neighborhood
Just listenin' to cars pass (Listenin' to cars pass)
[Bridge]
Yeah, I don't like silence
'Cause then all of these thoughts
And feelings bubble up inside and (Bubble up inside and)
Yeah, I don't like it
Repress all my emotion, put my doubt right in a trashcan
(Doubt right in a trashcan)

[Pre-Chorus]
Force a smile on my face (force a smile on my face)
Yeah, make a memory, erase it
Damn, I'm such a hopeless case (such a hopeless case)
If you don't like me then I get it

[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well
Yeah, I'm good at bein' lonely, can't you tell?
Oh well, oh well
Maybe I just shouldn't be so hard on myself (Hard on myself)

[Bridge]
Yeah, I don't like silence
'Cause then all of these thoughts
And feelings bubble up inside and (bubble up inside and)
Yeah, I don't like it
Repress all my emotion, put my doubt right in a trashcan
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well
Yeah, I'm good at bein' lonely, can't you tell?
Oh well, oh well
Maybe I just shouldn't be so hard on myself (Hard on myself)

[Outro]
Force a smile on my faceEmbed
