Suicide Saturday Lyrics[Verse 1: Jake]
I heard it told by her mother old
She could try, she could try it
With the power of tin and a bottle of gin
She was wise, she was wise to it
Cocked her father's gun, like the oldest son
She could try, she could try it
Blessed by the bed where she laid her head and calmed to a dull roar

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
[Verse 2: Jake]
She felled the streets 'til she heard the screams
She could drive, she could drive it
That was where she'd buy her time, yeah
Her friends were crazed in the solemn rains
She could try, she could try it
I met her once, she was tight, she was tight
She was tight, she was tight, she was tight as hell

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way

[Bridge: Jake]
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me
