Shut the Door Lyrics[Verse 1]
I broke the surface so I can breathe
I close my eyes so I can see
I tie my arms to be free
Have you ever been free?

[Chorus]
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back
[Verse 2]
I burn a fire to stay cool
I burn myself, I am the fuel
I never meant to be cruel
Have you ever been cruel?

[Chorus]
She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back, back, back

[Outro]
Shut the door, so I can leave
