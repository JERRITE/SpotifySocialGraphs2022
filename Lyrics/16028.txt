Call It Like I See It Lyrics[Chorus: Logan with Kendall]
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
Ah, yeah
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
Ah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kendall & Carlos]
Pull up on you, that's an intro
Just can't help it when you look like that
Spinning like a disco, uh
Make me want to make a demo track
Got me feeling like I'm retro
Leave your friends in the friend zone, right?
You can meet me in the end zone, right?
Let's keep it simple, baby
[Bridge: Kendall]
I'm too upfront
But from this point of view
(Pretty from the ground up, up)
Don't wanna say too much
But what you trying to do? Ah, yeah

[Chorus: Logan with Kendall]
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
Ah, yeah
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
Ah, yeah (I do)

[Post-Chorus: All]
Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight, feels tonight, feels tonight
Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight, feels tonight, feels tonight, yeah

[Verse 2: Logan, James, & All]
You blow my mind (Woah)
This feels like Space X (Space X)
Defying science (Yeah)
Floating out of this universe (Ha)
Love you like I do it for a living
Whenever we're together it's a given (Whenever)
Never hit the pool but still you're drippin' (Stupid)
Don't wanna be rude but I just
You might also like[Chorus: Logan with Kendall and Carlos]
Call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you
Ah, yeah (I do)

[Post-Chorus: All & Logan]
Out of this world like satellite (Yeah, yeah)
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight, feels tonight, feels tonight
Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight, feels tonight, feels tonight (In my feels tonight, yeah)

[Outro: Logan & James]
Call it like I see it, so you know, oh-oh
Come on, ha!
Ooh yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh4Embed
