Chahat Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, don’t you ever let me go
Cause I will bleed
Cause girl, I was blinded by the world
But now I see, now I see
Who would have thought
Who would believe
That you could change
My ways in an instant
You got me sprung
For me to leave
For me to leave the game
For the real thing
For the real thing
[Chorus]
Raste dilon ke saare
Tumse mile hai
Honthon pe teri baaton
Ke silsile hai
Tu hi nigahon mein
Dil ki panahon mein
Aisa lage hai
Teri chahaton pe kho gaye hai hum x2
[Verse 2]
So girl teri har harkat pe
Main hogaya fida, hogaya
Cause girl you are a muse
The words just come when I’m with you
When I’m with you
And even when I leave
When I’m on the road
We be like a team
Head down like a soldier
On the other line
That’s when I told ya
How do I say this any other way

[Chorus]
Raste dilon ke saare
Tumse mile hai
Honthon pe teri baaton
Ke silsile hai
Tu hi nigahon mein
Dil ki panahon mein
Aisa lage hai
Teri chahaton pe kho gaye hai hum x2
[Outro]
Kho gaye.. kho gaye…You might also likeEmbed
