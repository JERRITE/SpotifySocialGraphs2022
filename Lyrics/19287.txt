Backseat (Kiss Me) Lyrics[Intro]
Kiss me, like ain't nobody watching
Swing, swing, you swing around my head
Catch me, and I'll take off the mask
Won't let another moment slip through my hands, woah

[Chorus]
Kiss me in the backseat of my new Tahoe
Listening to static on the radio
Smoke some, hold it in
We might never get the chance to live again
Looks like the world is ending
Yeah, so kiss me
[Verse 1]
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't drive
We could post up here for the night
Faded off those big brown eyes
Cooped up with you is my vibе, yeah (Yeah)
I was cynical turned mе to a believer (Hey)
Turn the heat up to a hundred degrees, yeah (Ooh)
And I'm new to love but you said, "I'ma teach ya" (Ayy)
I'ma give you the sauce like I'm making pizza (Sauce)
I been waiting all my life to
Find a little bad one I could give my life to
Screaming, "Hallelujah," how did I find you?
'Cause you got that body but I want your mind too
This feels like a movie in the 80's
Dirty dancing on me like I'm Patrick Schwayze
Now we in the Chevy things are getting crazy
Yeah, so baby
(Won't you—)

[Chorus]
Kiss me in the backseat of my new Tahoe
Listening to static on the radio
Smoke some, hold it in
We might never get the chance to live again
Looks like the world is ending
Yeah, so kiss me
You might also like[Verse 2]
Yeah, following the vibe, no time for questions
Used to over think, a second guesser
You got me on autopilot like a Telsa
On a sex drive and you cut the tension
Yeah, you love the taste of my tattoos
Yeah, and your girlies say that I'm bad news
Yeah, from the second we met, had to have you
So let me ask you, is this what you imagined? Yeah
'Cause I never thought this would happen, yeah
Now the whole world's going up in flames
But right now nothing matters
(Won't you—)

[Chorus]
Kiss me in the backseat of my new Tahoe
Listening to static on the radio
Smoke some, hold it in
We might never get the chance to live again
Looks like the world is ending
Yeah, so kiss meEmbed
