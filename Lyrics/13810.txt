Foreign Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, gold on the ceiling, do it for the feeling
Not for the paycheck (Yeah, uh)
Rolling palm trees, yeah, no stress season
Feet up and I'm laid back (Back)

[Pre-Chorus]
So high, can't even take my jacket off
Smoke from my lips look like exhaust
Gotta feed your creatures when you in the dark
So deep, get your Uber lost
[Chorus]
Foreign things meant for me and I know that
Makin' new friends and drinkin' all night
Maybe I'll pack a bag and not go back
If you need me, I'll be here all damn night

[Post-Chorus]
Hop up on my throne, I feel alive
Feel like I could do this every night
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
Maybe it's a blessing in di—

[Verse 2]
I been spеaking gibberish, ayy, ayy
Give no fuck 'bout what you have to say, ayy
That's a promisе, I'ma make it
I, I, on my mama, hand up to the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing gon' put out my fire
Go on, let them try, it just get higher
I ain't gon' change, cradle to the grave, uh-uh

[Chorus]
Foreign things meant for me and I know that (Woo)
Makin' new friends and drinkin' all night
Maybe I'll pack a bag and not go back
If you need me, I'll be here all damn night
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Hop up on my throne, I feel alive
Feel like I could do this every night
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
Maybe it's a blessing in di—

[Bridge]
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night (Ooh-ooh)
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Foreign things meant for me and I know that
Makin' new friends and drinkin' all night (Drinkin' all night)
Maybe I'll pack a bag and not go back (Back)
If you need me, I'll be here all damn night (Night, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
(Hop up on my throne, I feel alive)
I'll be here all damn night
(Feel like I could do this every night)
I'll be here all damn night

[Outro]
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night (Yeah, yeah)Embed
