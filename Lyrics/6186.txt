Happy Place Lyrics[Hook: Brill]
I know a happy place that we could goooo
No one would know let's get away
(Oh oh)
I've got a happy place that we could gooo
Privately owned let's celebrate

[Verse 1: Taylor Bennett]
Smoking in the whip right now
Tryna cop the liq right now
Momma on the phone pipe down
But the party too lit right now
She gone have a fit now
No time for this right now
This my special secret sacred head quarters kingdom common Castle bring treasured booty captain drunker than a sailor
Fine fit wasted still so tailored
You outrageous we out ranges
You can't touch us we so dangerous
Strangers moving
Bodies grooving
I could tell you the love music
Parents calling tap ya celly it's no telling what ya doing
Marijuana now she wanna tap coronas with the homies
I could see she down to know me
Banding up off all my lonelies
I can only swisher roll up
Hold my cup and call my homies
Ain't got no time for goofies groupies
Yea we be wilding don't we
Really wanna try to get to know ya
Pillow talk lame so we made out on the sofa
Bad little chick say her audi on the corner
Friends just left mama get back in the morning
Iiiiight
Sounds like a plan
Swerved on the homies then got out that jam
My happy place is the trap house and the crib
Than Come back next week and do it again
[Hook: Brill]
I know a happy place that we could goooo
No one would know let's get away
(Oh oh)
I know a happy place that we could gooo
Privately owned let's celebrate

I know a happy place that we could gooo
No one would know let's get away
(Oh oh)
I know a happy place that we could gooo
Privately owned let's celebrate

[Bridge: Brill]
I just caught you staring
Oooooo
You don't have to feel embarrassed nah
It ain't no comparing to you
Just want to see your body move
I've got this private place
Top floor popping those bottles
We celebrating
Imagine living life like this
You said you dreamt a life like this

[Verse 2: Taylor Bennett]
But you ain't never seen it
Imma show you baby
Imma show you how to get it
Summer time late night
Chi town on the fitted
Left foot right foot
That's it, let's get it
You can move, I can move
We can groove
Let's get it
Let's go let's move
This a night you ain't forgetting
And it's summer time chi
Got the roof at a distance
Hands in the air Iike the motherfucker missing
I be going going crazy
I'm a younging on a mission
You can tell by the Bugatti
I'm not into water whipping
But shorty still getting money like
I'm done with the dishes
Smart mouth kid with a million dollar business
Imma go cray like z wasn't mentioned
Pass me the wood and the loud and the swisher
Sorry bout that
I'm Chicago ignit
Walk in the room they like
Girl who is that?
That's Mr. Bennett
Or
Mr. Been bad
Or
Mr. Been that
The man to get at
