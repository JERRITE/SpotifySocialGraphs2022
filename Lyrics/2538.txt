La Da Dee Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no way to say this song's about someone else
Every time you're not in my arms, I start to lose myself
Someone, please pass me my shades, don't let them see me down
You have taken over my days, so tonight I'm going out

[Pre-Chorus]
Yet, I'm feeling like there is no better place than
Right by your side, I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
[Chorus]
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you

[Verse 2]
All these places packed with people, but your face is all I see
And the music's way too loud, but your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around, they're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has got me spun, and I don't know what to say next

[Pre-Chorus]
Yet, I'm feeling like there is no better place than
Right by your side, I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you
You might also like[Verse 3]
I pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the bros
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind
La-de-da

[Pre-Chorus]
Yet, I'm feeling like there is no better place than
Right by your side, I had a little taste
And I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da me, la-da-da you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you24Embed
