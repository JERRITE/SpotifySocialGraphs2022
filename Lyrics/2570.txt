Something About the Sunshine Lyrics[Verse 1: Christopher Wilde]
Wake up to the blue sky
Grab your shades
And let's go for a ride
Breakfast by the ocean
We'll do lunch at Sunset and Vine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
Every day's a dream in California
Every night, the stars come out to play
Wish that I could always feel this way
[Chorus 1: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Oh, it's alright
There's something about the sunshine
There's something about the sunshine

[Verse 2: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
Hollywood, we're rocking
In Malibu, we hang out and chill
It's all about the shopping
From Melrose to Beverly Hills

[Pre-Chorus 2: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
Everywhere's a scene
And now we're in it
I don't wanna paint this town alone, oh no
When I see you smile, I always feel at home

[Chorus 2: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
L.A.'s a breeze with the palm trees swaying
Oh, it's alright
You might also like[Bridge: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
Now that you're here (now that you're here)
It's suddenly clear (it's suddenly clear)
The sun's coming through, I never knew
Whatever I do, it's better with you
It's better with you

[Breakdown: Anna Margaret & Christopher Wilde]
There's something about the sunshine, baby
(There's something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light (whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time, baby (baby)
Oh, it's alright (it's alright)

[Chorus 1: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light (whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time baby (oh)
Oh, it's alright (it's alright)

[Outro: Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret]
There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
L.A.'s a breeze with the palm trees swaying
Oh, it's alrightEmbed
