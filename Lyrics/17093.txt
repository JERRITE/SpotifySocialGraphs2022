She Know It Lyrics[Intro]
(2GlocckTopp)
Yeah, just like, bein' playa, like
You gotta be playa all situations (In this situation, that's pushin' P)
Can't be half steppin', half layin' (No kizzy)
Gotta be playa all situations

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm playa, she know it (Top chef)
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy (Babygirl)
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand (Brr)
Poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah, she goin'
Holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller, match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1's (Air Force 1's)
[Verse 1]
I ain't rockin' Cartier, Gotit got on CD's (Gotit)
Beat it from the back, she throw it back like a frisbee (Ha, sure)
Nigga had dropped out, yeah, I be Wock'd out (Wock'd out)
Bitch so bad, yeah, she suckin' out the lean-ni (Hoodbaby)
Burn and then diss ya, send ya ass ten feet
Awful lot of slimes and print them on my Dickie's (Shout out Jessie, you know what I'm sayin')
Hop out broad day, hit a 360
Hoppin' out of beyblades, spinnin' 'til you dizzy
Spinnin' like an arson and walkin' out the booth (Hot)
Yeah, I'm drippin' on some off shit, walkin' in the room
Get to poppin' on a broke bitch, neck typhoon
On some all we on go shit, niggas on shrooms (On slime)
Black, bought a box of chocolates 'cause I'm not a wrestler
So many bitches despite I'm a bachelor
.38 special, one shot, that's a caliber (Grrah)
Givin' APD, hell Demons and Challengers (Ah-ah)
Lit nigga, hot coupe, lit nigga hot
Fuckin' with my spirits, I'ma put 'em in a pot
London rocking shows, damn, my pocket got a knot
Fuckin' on the baddest, yeah, I'm pickin' out the ripe (Yeah)
Ten service, fire my mink's on the line
Yeah, you want a purse, bitch talkin' like I'm blind
You ain't set Franklins, mane, never been by
Shooter in Vegas accept payments, no lie
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm playa, she know it (Playa)
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand (Touch it, slime)
Poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah, she goin'
Holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller, match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1's

[Verse 2]
Get off a pack at the spot, let 'em go at it
Forgiattos, Moscatos, that's just what I'm on (Swervin' off)
That money the model, gon' fuck with a dime (Money the model)
Thugger-Thugger livin' So Much Fun (Slime)
What you want for that P, it's a problem
'Cause you know ain't none free in this life, bro (I'm a playa)
Turn the channel, I ain't never been light (Uh-uh)
I'm a player, I'm a freak, yeah, 'ight
Bein' 'bout your business, babygirl, keep your head on
Break the bank, stripper shake it down 'til your bread gone
Block got hot, had to switch it, took the bag on 'em
Stick in the bookbag, shawty got a leg on her
Yeah, shawty got a leg on her
Fasho, that's a leg on her
For the right price, I'll put my mans on her (Fire)
Break me off then go and put them bands on you (My slime)
Don't tolerate disrespect, we put them hands on him (No bap)
Bullseye, yeah, them bullets gonna land on him (Ten feet)
How the fuck you gon' fuck up a check when you constantly out here just worryin' 'bout the net? (Huh?)
Life a gamble, I'm placin' the bet (Can't be bet)
Real shit, you gotta hold down and say it
(Whatever you do, just keep it P)
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm playa, she know it
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand
Poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah, she goin'
Holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller, match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1'sEmbed
