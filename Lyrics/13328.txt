Devil in Paradise Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna be where the sun don't shine
Where the birds don't sing and the kids don't smile
They say, "I saw the Devil in paradise"
I wanna be where the night is day
Where the roses die and the thorns ain't fake
And they say, "I saw the Devil with a smilin' face"

[Verse 1]
I'll never go back to California (No, no, no)
I'll never go back to Hollywood (No, no, no)
Don't wanna feel no morning sun
Burn my shadow till the day is over and done
I'll never go back to Hollywood
I'll never go back to California (No, no, no, oh)
I'll never get old in them lonely hills (No, no)
It's like the sun got frozen in an ice cold sky
Trapped there laughing when the stars don't shine
I'd (rather) die than live for them dollar bills
[Chorus]
I wanna be where the sun don't shine
Where the birds don't sing and the kids don't smile
They say, "I saw the Devil in paradise"
I wanna be where the night is day
Where the roses die and the thorns ain't fake
And they say, "I saw the Devil with a smilin' face"
I wanna be where the shotguns spray
Where God gets high and the priests don't pray
And they say, "I saw the Devil with a diamond chain"
I wanna be where the sun don't shine
Where the birds don't sing and the kids don't smile
They say, "I saw the Devil in paradise"

[Verse 2]
After all that I
After all that I did for you?
After all that I
After all that I did for you?
Sipping French wine with the Devil
"Pretty thing, slip in my ride" said the Devil
Coastin' by the Hollywood sign with the Devil
Getting that money on time with the Devil
Mama said, "don’t you go sign with the Devil
Titties out, sniffin’ Snow White with the Devil"
Clever guys lying, and I’m buying, say I’m special
Said he sent the cheque, but tide me over with a bezel
Promised me the penthouse, got me on the lowest level
Running from the repo' when you thought you was a rebel
How they gonna tow you while you sleeping in the rental?
No one gonna know you- better show him your (potential)

Pussy, coochie, cha cha!  you better show him your pussy bitch, before you get yo ass blacklisted!
After all that I
After all that I did for you?
After all that I
After all that I did for you?

[Outro]
I feel you
Thank you so much [?]
“Uh, excuse me? Hey! How's it goin’?
