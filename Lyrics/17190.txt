Heads High Lyrics[Intro]
Nana-na, nana-na, nana-na, nana-na no
Kill them with the "Nooooo"
Nana-na, nana-na, nana-na, nana-na no
Kill them with the...

[Chorus]
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy ain't got no secret for you
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High.. kill dem with the "No!"
Tell them say, "Vegas say so..."
(make a boy know you ah no pappy show)
[Verse 1]
Me want you skin your teeth, and make me see it
If you sure from you born say you never do it
You a no freak, one man you keep
And him never yet complain say, "you're  deep"
You make your vow, you know, answer to 'yow'
And a one man a sample your chocho
Lift up your brow
Make a guy know
Say him if him move him blow-wow
...and sing again

[Chorus]
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy ain't got no secret for you
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High.. kill dem with the "No!"
Tell them say, "Vegas say so..."
(make a boy know you ah no pappy show)

[Verse 2]
Me want hear you scream
If your mouth clean
No man never rope you in for no ice cream
You don't smell green
Like Sharlene
You hold a fresh
And have a healthy hygiene
Some assuming, while you keep blooming
Like a pretty little lilly inna di morning
You're not brawling, pressure dem darling
While you're rising them keep falling
...so sing again

Tell them say, "Vegas say so..."
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
Just make a bwoy know you nah blow
Heads High...kill them with the "No!"
No bwoy ain't got no secret for you

Hand inna the air, 'cause you a no ray-ray
One ship alone can dock 'pon a bay
Pon a bwoy mic you nah DJ
