Vapor Rub Lyrics[Intro]
Austin
Yeah, baby

[Chorus]
Don't let me down 'cause, baby, I've been good to ya
Just take me like a vitamin, I'm good for ya
Don't need someone to tell me that I'm good enough
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
I won't keep you long
So say what's on your mind
Just say what's on your mind
[Chorus]
I sleep late in the morning so don't wake me up
This loving got you sick, you need some vapor rub
It's been a while but you're the one I'm thinking of (You're the one I'm thinking of)
So don't be actin' out, I know you think you tough

[Verse 2]
Let your guard down 'cause I got you
Blur the noise, put my focus on you (My focus on you)
Came in talkin' loud, now you silent
Take you high, put the plane on autopilot

[Refrain]
I won't keep you long (I won't)
So say what's on your mind (Say what's on)
Just say what's on your mind (Say what's on your mind)
Oh, baby
I won't keep you long (Keep you long)
So say what's on your mind (Your mind)
Just say what's on your mind (On your mind)

[Chorus]
Don't let me down 'cause, baby, I've been good to ya
Just take me like a vitamin, I'm good for ya
Don't need someone to tell me that I'm good enough
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You want that work, put in work for me (Put in work for me)
Be on your job, yeah
On the clock, sweet talk to me (Sweet talk to me)
No punching out, yeah
I know what they say to you about me
Some of them are probably true (yeah)
Sometimes I'm grumpy and I'm rude
You know I got many moods
But I can be the sweetest when I choose
It's all on you (It's all on you)
I said it's all on you

[Refrain]
I won't keep you long (I won't)
So say what's on your mind (Say what's on)
Just say what's on your mind (Say what's on your mind)

I won't keep you long
So say what's on your mind
Just say what's on your mind1Embed
