Feel Your Love Lyrics[Chorus]
Wrap around, open arms
And let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
And we ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
We ain't gotta talk about lovin' no more
Just let me feel your love
Let me feel your love

[Post-Chorus]
Times ain't that bad
Of course you're making me mad
Driving me crazy, oh, no no
I wouldn't change it, baby, don't go
[Verse 1]
I guess we were drinking for the hell of it
And yelling shit
I don't even know the melody
No energy, we've been dancing for the whole night
But with you , I guess it's alright
We be treating every day like it's a holiday
My momma say, work hard, but I gotta play
Cause with you, I know it's alright
Let's just do this here all night

[Chorus] + [Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Why you always on your phone?
I can't get with it
I'm yelling shit
Oh, now you say she a relative?
I bet she is
We say nothing for the whole night
I can't do this here all night
Gave you something no other girl could ever give
Me and you against the world, we on some rebel shit
Oooh with you I know I'll be alright
But I can't do this all night
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love1Embed
