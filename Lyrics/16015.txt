We Own the Night/Night Falls Mashup Lyrics[Intro: Descendants 2 Cast]
Watch your back
Watch your back
Watch your back
Watch your back

[Verse 1: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Chandler Kinney]
Swords in the air
If you're with me
They got us outnumbered 1-50
But I know the best way, fall back, let me lead
You hold the line and we'll bring them to their knees
No-no-no one's catching me unless I wanna be caught
I'm dancing in the shadows, ain't no leash when I walk
It's great to feel invincible, it's great to feel alive
My appetite's insatiable, there's nowhere it can hide
[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Sofia Carson, *Cast of ZOMBIES 2*]
This is my crew
This is my squad (*Awooooo*)
This is my turf (*We're wolves*)
*We own the night *
Until the night falls
Everyone
*Until the night falls (Wolves)
We own the night*

[Chorus: Cast of ZOMBIES 2, Descendants 2 Cast]
Oh, we own what we own
Oh, we own the night
Oh, we own what we own
We own the night
The only thing that is worse
Than our bark's our bite
Oh, we own what we own
We own the night (Watch your back)

[Bridge: Descendants 2 Cast, Cast of ZOMBIES 2]
Watch your back
Watch your back (Awooooo)
Watch your back

[Verse 2: China Anne McClain, Dove Cameron, Pearce Joza]
All my soldiers stand at the ready
We can cut 'em up like confetti
'Cause if we stick together, we can make it out alive
I'll cause a distraction, you attack them from the side
I'm picking up the scent, it seems we're on the right track
The moonlight's on the rooftops, the win is at our backs
We'll hit 'em from the front, you counter from behind
Don't forget the fate of Auradon's on the line

Until the night falls
Everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
*Oh, we own what we own
We own the night*

[Chorus: Cast of ZOMBIES 2]
Oh, we own what we own
We own the night
Oh, we own what we own
We own the night
The only thing that is worse
Than our bark's our bite
Oh, we own what we own
We own the night

[Outro: Chandler Kinney, Cast of ZOMBIES 2]
We own what we own
The night is our home
We own what we own
Wolves (Awooooo)
We own the nightEmbed
