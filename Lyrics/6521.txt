Running Up That Hill Lyrics[Intro]
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"

[Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?

[Pre-Chorus]
You (Be running up that hill)
You and me (Be running up that hill)
[Chorus]
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby
So much hate for the ones we love
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?

[Pre-Chorus]
You (Be running up that hill)
You and me (Be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh-oh
You might also like[Bridge]
Come on, baby, come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel, come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh-oh

[Chorus]
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

If I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

[Outro]
(If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill)7Embed
