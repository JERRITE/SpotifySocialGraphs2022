‚Äçif i cleaned everything LyricsOne more week
And things are at an end
I am not myself
I haven't been in months
I am not alone
I know it won't be long
The sky is turning black
I can't keep my food down
It will be cold
It will be blue like you
When I come back home
Everything stops
Getting out of bed
Is the hardest partYou might also like5Embed
