​fake love don’t last Lyrics[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Are, you recording?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I watched a movie scene, got déjà vu
'Cause the antagonist looked just like you
It's such a pretty thing, but I see right through
You got a dark side, well, I got a dark side too

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy, I don't trust a soul, not even dead ones (Dead ones)
All it took was leavin' me on read once (Read once)
You still try to call me when you get drunk (Get drunk)
'Cause out of all your exes, I'm the best one
I'm like mmm-mmm-mmm, I don't care
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
So go ahead and pose like that and post like that
I, I wanna, I-I
I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
See go ahead and pose like that and post like that

She said she didn't wanna go too fast
Guess the money made her push that gas
Found someone to trade her love for cash
Ooh, no
She been throwin' shots, I had to catch one (Catch one)
Gambled with my life, I'm here to bet some (Bet some)
Made some bad decisions, don't regret one
