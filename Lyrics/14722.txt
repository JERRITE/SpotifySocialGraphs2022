I Know You Too Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard you saying the same words that I said
I saw you reading the same book that I've read
I heard you singing a song that I wrote myself
I know you too well

[Chorus]
I know you only too well
I know you only too well

[Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Mirror faced, tiresome and restless, two extremes
Finite eyes, why follow me?
I know you better than I know myself
I know you too well

[Chorus]
I know you only too well
I know you only too well
I know you only too well
I know you only too well

[Outro]
This is not your voice
This is not your voice
This is not your voice
And this is not youYou might also likeEmbed
