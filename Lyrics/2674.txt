TranslationsDeutschTurning Me Up (Hadal Ahbek) Lyrics[Intro: Issam Alnajjar]
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, ra-ra

[Verse 1: Ali Gatie]
Froze the room when you walked in
Everybody stopped talking
Love the way that you move
Wanna get to know you, we could rendezvous
Blurry-eyed, I can't see straight
Falling hard, I'm off my face
Never gonna come down when you're turnin' me up
[Chorus: Issam Alnajjar]
You're turnin' me up, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, ra-ra
You're turnin' me up, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, ra-ra

[Post-Chorus: Ali Gatie]
No one gets me high like you, high like you
No one, no one gets me high like you
You're turnin' me up, babe, you're turnin' me
No one gets me high like you, high like you
No one, no one gets me high like you
You're turnin' me up, babe, you're turnin' me

[Verse 2: Issam Alnajjar]
Sending texts in the moonlight
We're just lookin' for good nights
It's too late to go out, so
I'm thinkin' 'bout you and a rendezvous
I say, "We should go my place"
Call me when you're outside, babe
Days been turnin' me down when you're turnin' me up
Hetti rasek a'l makhadeh
Joua albi ma fi adek
Loono abyad howe albek
Ma hada zayek
Yooma sho aajabni raddeek
Ana dayman ha dalni janbek
Law kano kollom deddek
Hadal ahebek

Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, ra-ra
You're turnin' me up, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa, pa-ra, pa-ra, pa-ra
Pa-pa, ra-ra

[Post-Chorus: Ali Gatie]
No one gets me high like you, high like you
No one, no one gets me high like you
You're turnin' me up, babe, you're turnin' me
No one gets me high like you, high like you
No one, no one gets me high like you
You're turnin' me up, babe, you're turnin' me
