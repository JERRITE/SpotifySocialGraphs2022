Let You Go (Sebastian Ingrosso x Desembra Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't be the only who takes you home
Oh, you've been out with everyone, you can't sleep alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do the same, see how you do it
I'ma do the same thing

[Chorus]
I was thinking you were leaving
Every weekend so deceiving
On an island, I decided
To let you go
[Drop]
(Go)
(Go)

[Verse 2]
It feels like you're somewhere else when
I hold you close, no
You've been out doing the most when
I need you most, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do thе same thing that you been doing
You can call it love but I see right through it
Two can play the samе game

[Chorus]
I was thinking you were leaving
Every weekend so deceiving
On an island, I decided
To let you go
I was thinking you were leaving
Every weekend so deceiving
On an island, I decided
To let you go
