For Someone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Guess that you'll be leaving now
Even in your deepest doubt
Have you got it all
Figured out?

The smell of you is on me still
The night died way too young
This feeling is alive and well
Even in your deepest dread
Have you got a faultline in your head?
[Chorus]
I was waiting for someone
To turn my world around
You came in the summer
And time was winding down

[Verse 2]
Wonder what you're thinking now
Even in your deepest doubt
Have you got it all
Figured out?

[Chorus]
I was waiting for someone
To turn my world around
You came in the summer
And time was winding down

I was waiting for someone
To turn my world around
You came in the summer
And time was winding down

[Verse 3]
Why do you, why do you, why do you lie?
Not coming, not coming back
How could you, how could you, how could you lie?
You're not coming, not coming back
How could you, how could you, how could you lie?
You're not coming, not coming back

I was waiting for someone
To turn my world around
You came in the summer
And time was winding down

I was waiting for someone
To turn my world around
You came in the summer
And time was winding down2Embed
