Island Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?
I swear I felt it slowing down for a minute
I know it sounds crazy
But looking at you, baby
With your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion
Your body's swaying like the waves in the ocean
I know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there
[Chorus]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time

[Verse 2]
Ain't gotta worry about a beach bar closing
I gotta bottle of tequila we can open right here
I'm just saying, it's like we're on vacation

[Chorus]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time, yeah

If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

[Outro]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
