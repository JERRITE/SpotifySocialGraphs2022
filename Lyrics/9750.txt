Cash Money Is an Army Lyrics[Intro]
Shit just too real
Respect my mind, on the real I'm tellin' you what's real
Shit just too real
I'ma come like this

[Verse 1]
Money makin' is my thing 'cause I'm tryna be rich
Tryna put away mills, that's why I'm in the studio on my shit
Droppin' rap after rap like you sell ki' after ki'
Backed up by the best, Fresh droppin' beat after beat
My clique is the Hot Boys, best believe we so hot
And dangerous if we in beef, we'll clear the whole block
No fading us at all, nigga, 'cause we roll too deep
With AKs off safety knockin' niggas off they feet
I go by the name the B.G. 
I ride on chrome in the '98 Lex ES 3'
I bust a nigga dome for Baby, known as B-3
And all these niggas know my dog'll do the same for me, we family
Cash Money Is a army, nigga, a navy nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Don't playa hate me, nigga, 'cause I'll leave your shit stale
Light your ass up real good and you will never get well
[Chorus]
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga

[Verse 2]
I got a path that you don't wanna cross
But if you do decide to cross, your wig get knocked off
I play it raw 'cause it's a dirty game, a dirty world
I play it raw and do my thing, nigga, fuck the world
Ain't nothin' change, we still floss in the best of rides
I ain't got to name it, you know what it is on twenty-inch tires
I know I'm tired of these bitches tryna get me killed
I'm tired of these stankin' hoes smilin' in my grill, shit just too real
And I'm in a battlefield tryna get my mills
It ain't no secret I got skills to pay the bills
I'm climbin' up the fuckin' hills
Cash Money highly respected without a major deal
I'm still that Chopper City nigga that like to chill
Your head still a banana, if you slip, it will get peeled
I drop my nuts in any situation, any day
'Cause on the real, B.G. 'bout trigga play, trigga play

[Chorus]
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga

My stomping ground is the motherfuckin' U.P.T. 
You want me, I can be found on V.L. in the 13
Rest in peace, my heart goes out to my round L.T. 
A slim nigga with two at the bottom, four 'cross the T-O-P
A H.B., a trill nigga, a hard up rider
Lay low and be cool, I'll meet your on the other side
I been thinkin' 'bout you day and night
Without you on my all-night flight, it don't go right
But you know one thing, I been keepin' it real
Your lil' one is like mine, ain't gon' miss a meal
I'm still, still shining like you left me, dawg
My Rolex still winding like you left it for
Me and my clique still ball, still stunt for sure
I just got the Mercedes Jeep off the showroom floor
Our dawg Valle done touched down, we just maintainin'
Representin' draining, gone to hotels trainin'
Trainin', drainin', fucking these hoes all day and all night

[Chorus]
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, nigga
Cash Money is a army, nigga, a navy, nigga
So if you ever try to harm me, nigga, it ain't gravy, niggaEmbed
