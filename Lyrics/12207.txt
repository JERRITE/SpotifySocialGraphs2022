Taking My Life Away LyricsThey reach beside
A leech to find
I dreamed of this so long
This used to feel so strong

Now I wait
Wish these thoughts would go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life away
No I don't hate
But these thoughts won't go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life away
Deep down it hides
Making life a grind
I dreamed of this so long
This used to feel so strong

Now I wait

Wish these thoughts would go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life away
No I don't hate
But these thoughts won't go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life away

Deep down it hides

Now I wait
Wish these thoughts would go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life away
No I don't hate
But these thoughts won't go away
I hope I dream of you
Cause it's taking my life awayYou might also like1Embed
