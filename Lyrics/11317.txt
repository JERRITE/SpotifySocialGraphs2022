Me And My Life LyricsMama
Let me go I don't want to stay

Hey Daddy
Put our whip away
I wish
I was away
Away
Away

Hey mama
Maybe I'm a loner
But I've got to say

Hey
I've got to try to break away
I wish
I was away
Away

Hey mama

Wouldn't like to have my own mind
Living on my own might work out just fine

Oh
Me and my life
Me and my life
Oh
Me and my life

Mama
Let me go...You might also likeEmbed
