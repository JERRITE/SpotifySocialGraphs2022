Crying Over You Lyrics[Intro: Pontus Hjelm]
Have you ever been in love before?
Have you ever made mistakes?
Like when you feel invincible
You really should be careful
And don't forget your heart is on the line
There's a price to pay and stakes are high
Remember to be careful

[Verse 1: Stoffe Andersson]
Watch your step, take it slow
Because you never know if love hurts
Watch your back, tread carefully
Follow your heart, but think twice 'cause love hurts
[Chorus: Pontus Hjelm]
Everything felt so right, now I just want my revenge
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
Everything felt so good, never thought you could pretend
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you, I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you

[Verse 2: Stoffe Andersson]
It's a constant battle
Between beginnings and endings, yes, love hurts
Like the blood inside my heart is pumping on and on
I'll keep on fighting till the day I die

[Chorus: Pontus Hjelm]
Everything felt so right, now I just want my revenge
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
Everything felt so good, never thought you could pretend
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you, I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you

[Post-Chorus: Pontus Hjelm]
I knew it was too good to be true
But I am not crying over you
Bittersweet, I know, it's over now
I'm not crying over you, crying over you
Oh no, oh no, oh yeah

Have you ever been in love before?
Have you ever made mistakes?
Like when you feel invincible, oh
Remember to be careful

[Chorus: Pontus Hjelm]
Everything felt so right, now I just want my revenge
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
Everything felt so good, never thought you could pretend
I'm telling myself that I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you, I'm not crying over you
I'm not crying over you1Embed
