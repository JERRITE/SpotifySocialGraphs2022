Live, Learn, Let Go LyricsThe butterflies  come back to me
With peace of mind for broken wings
And these days are harder than the last I know
But this song we all know
We live and learn and let go

So tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
When they stare right through me
Can they see my heart beat?
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't  take away the pain to make you see again
'Cause all I wanna be is anything
And I still remember every word
That I ever wrote about you, girl
They came like air to me
In my head I played out everything
Just tell me it's not time to let go

Tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
Can they see my heart beat?
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
'Cause all I wanna be is anything

And your friends, they talk a lot
I hear just how you're doing and it's sad
There's still a memory of us laughing
And it sits inside your head
You try to make believe you never were in love with me
I'll drink your eyes away
And try to hide the way my own stay red
And I wanna be whole, I wanna be anything
We live and learn and let go

Tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
Can they see my heart beat?
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
'Cuase all I wanna be is anythingYou might also likeEmbed
