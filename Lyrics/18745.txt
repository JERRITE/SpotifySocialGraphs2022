Long Haired Punks LyricsBat out of hell, engines ablaze
Riding the night, flying through days
Hell bent for mayhem, so full of spunk
Black metal gods, long haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned
Dogs of mayhem don't give a damn
Screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk
Y'all watch out, we're the long haired punks
A bad example, up for a fight
Breaking the law, demonic delight
A dark destroyer, morals are sunk
We're power metal,l ong haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned
Dogs of mayhem,don't give a damn
Screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk
Y'all watch out, we're the long haired punks, yeah!
Fight for survival, hitting the road
Get out my way, time for a show
We blast metal, no hip hop or funk
Demons from hell,long haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned
Dogs of mayhem who don't give a damn
Screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk
Y'all watch out we're the long haired punks!You might also likeEmbed
