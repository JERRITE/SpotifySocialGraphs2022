Out Of Touch (71 Digits Edit) LyricsYou're out of touch—
But I'm out of my head—
You're out of touch—
But I'm out of my head—

You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (I'm out of—)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch, I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (But I'm out of my head when you're not around)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (But I'm out of my head when you're not around)You might also likeEmbed
