Hell On Earth Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy, look, ayy

[Chorus]
Hide my face from the world
I disappear like a magician, now my world had done twirled
I fade to black, look where I'm at, this hell on Earth is a curse
I stage dive it, ghost ride it, then whip it right in reverse, yeah, ayy, look

[Verse]
Excuse me, mama, I ain't mean to ball
I ain't mean to sell Xans but the bands was calling
Late night on the creep 'til my demons call me
Jesus calling, please, get off me
Boy, karma ain't a bitch, she just breathing softly
Wait, I can't disrespect, so lead me to sorry, ayy
I apologize, I just need a conscience, man
Lost in your sauce so the deeper I get into
Shit, I can't recall the last time I was forgetful
Falling on a thin line, might die, I hurt you
Praying for the best, open chest with a flesh wound
Color of my dream with a beam looking red too
Friends turned into a faded page when I met you
Oh please, don't make me feel regretful
My pride wonâ€™t let me run up in you
But, my gosh, nigga, please don't feel testful
Empty out my schedule
Making plans? Wow, so I guess we down to Earth too
Down to Earth man, these roots gon' hurt you
Praying five times so I hope that it will bless you
Sitting, contemplating on my life in a restroom
Coming live vibe, I just die so regretful, ayy, look
I said coming live vibe, I just die so regretful, ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
Hide my face from the world
I disappear like a magician, now my world had done twirled
I fade to black, look where I'm at, this hell on Earth is a curse
I stage dive it, ghost ride it, then whip it right in reverse, yeah, ayyYou might also like2Embed
