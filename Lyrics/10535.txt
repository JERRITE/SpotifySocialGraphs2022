My Vampire LyricsMy Vampire, my vampire's fine
My vampire, my vampire's OK

[Verse 1]
He wants to break the rules I've made
He wants to crash my castle gate
Prince of Darkness you wake up too late

[Chorus]
Oh no it's all a mess
Dont know if I should undress
The wounds you want to caress
I made it to the other side
Now I dont love no more
And you try knock down that door
You should have been there before
I made it to the other side


[Verse 2]
And now the sun is coming up
You pull away you've had enough
We got too close you're burning up

[Verse 2 (repeated)]
And now the sun is coming up
You pull away you've had enough
We got too close you're burning up


[Chorus]
Oh no it's all a mess
Dont know if I should undress
The wounds you want to caress
I made it to the other side

Now I dont love no more
And you try knock down that door
You should have been there before
I made it to the other sideYou might also likeEmbed
