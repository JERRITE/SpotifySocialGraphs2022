Something Like Happiness Lyrics[Hook]
Oooooh
You just know when you know you just know
Oooooh
You got somewhere to go when you go

[Verse 1]
Must be like nothing else
Must be like nothing else
Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you and comfort and seem
Something like happiness
[Hook]
Oooooh
You just know when you know you just know
Oooooh
You got somewhere to go when you go

[Verse 2]
If you love them
Go and tell them
Tell them over and over and over again
Heaven forbid opportunity's missed

If it's over
Let it be over
Cause when time and again you have tried it again
And you've worn it right down to the bone

[Hook]
You just know when you know you just know
You got somewhere to go when you go

[Outro]
Must be like nothing else
Must be like nothing else
Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you and comfort and seem
Something like happiness
You might also likeMust be like nothing else
Must be like nothing else
Taste like nothing else
Help like nothing else
Ease you and comfort and seem
Something like happinessEmbed
