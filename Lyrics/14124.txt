Câ€™mere Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's way too late
To be this locked inside ourselves
The trouble is
That you're in love with someone else
It should be me
Oh, it should be me

[Verse 2]
Sacred parts
Your getaways
You come along
On summer days
Tenderly
Tastefully
[Hook]
And so may
We make time
Try and find somebody else
This place is mine

[Verse 2]
Set the date
You know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts, little girl
I'm in love with something real
It could be me
That's changing

[Hook]
And so may
We make time
To try and find somebody else
Who has aligned

[Verse 3]
Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long, ending fast
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, how I love you
Oh, in the evenings
When we are sleeping
We are sleeping
Oh, we are sleeping

[Hook]
And so may
We make time
We try and find somebody else who
Has aligned

[Verse 4]
Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long, oh, ending fast8Embed
