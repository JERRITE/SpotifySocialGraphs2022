Lovesick riddim Lyrics[Intro]
Oh I
I wonder where you are
Boy after dragging us through all this mess
All but the truth I forgot to confess

[Verse 1]
There’s a pounding in my head
Another teardrop on my pillow
Hear that song there on the radio
They’re calling it the Lovesick Riddim
[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna say I was wrong
And I need you more than I let on
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh I
I wonder where you are
Boy after dragging us through all this mess
All but the truth I forgot to confess
Oh I
I wanna love you
Would you be willing?
Could you be forgiving?
And believe I do

[Verse 2]
The heat outside don’t compare
To the fever that’s taken me victim
I feel you everywhere I go
But only see you when I’m dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna say I was wrong
And I need you more than I let on
Oh, oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh I
I wonder where you are
Boy after dragging us through all this mess
All but the truth I forgot to confess
Oh I
I wanna love you
Would you be willing?
Could you be forgiving?
And believe I do

[Bridge]
If you can hear me now
I love you, please don’t doubt
I figured it out
I can’t live without I’d do anything to see you again
If I could go back now
You sitting on my couch
I wouldn’t shout
Would not shut you out
I wouldn’t be lying here with this…
Heavy pounding in my head
They’re callin' it the Lovesick Riddim

[Chorus]
Oh I
I wonder where you are
Boy after dragging us through all this mess
All but the truth I forgot to confess
Oh I
I wanna love you
Would you be willing?
Could you be forgiving?
And believe I do
Oh I
I wonder where you are
Boy after dragging us through all this mess
All but the truth I forgot to confess
Oh I
I wanna love you
Would you be willing?
Could you be forgiving?
And believe I doEmbed
