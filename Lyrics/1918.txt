Figures, a Reprise Lyrics[Verse 1: Jessie Reyez]
Figures
I'm the bad guy cause I can't learn to trust
Love figures
You say sorry once and you think it's enough
I got a lineup of girls and a lineup of guys
Begging for me just to give 'em a try
Figures
I'm willing to stay 'cause I'm sick for your love

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
I wish I could hurt you back
Love, what would you do if you couldn't get me back?
You're the one who's gonna lose
Somethin' so special, somethin' so real
Tell me boy, how in the fuck would you feel
If you couldn't get me back? Hm
That's what I wish that I could do
To you-ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
To you-ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
Wish that I could help myself, give my love to someone else
Stuck to you, you turn me to a fool
Worried 'bout my mental health, all the pain that I've done felt
Knocked me right off my own pedestal
I got a cup full of whiskey, 150
Reasons to leave, I just pray that you'll miss me
Figures
I'm sick for your love, I just can't get enough

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez, Daniel Caesar, Both]
I wish I could hurt you back
Wish I could hurt you back
Love, what would you do if you couldn't get me back?
If you couldn't get me back, yeah
You're the one who's gonna lose
Somethin' so special, somethin' so real
Tell me boy, how in the fuck would you feel
Tell me, girl, how in the fuck would you feel?
If you couldn't get me back?
You couldn't get me back
That's what I wish that I could do
To you-ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
To you-ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
