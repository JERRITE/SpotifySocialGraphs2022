My Horror Lyrics[Chorus]
Hey you, hey you
Think I got a
A hole in my head
I think all the numbness
Finally sank in
It's making my
Head decay, head decay
When I walk by they screamin'
"Isn't anybody home in there?"
Home in there, I know
When they wind me up
I can make it through
Hell and back, hell and back
[Refrain]
Me in my horror
A day in my horror
Me in my horror
Just a day in my horror

[Verse 1]
Roll right over out of bed
I don't even know
What day it was
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Here I come, there I go
I can't feel, it's like I'm paralyzed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Look around and see they dead too
Wonder who is runnin' this town
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's my life, I'm insidе but
I'm outside it like a passengеr

[Chorus]
Hey you, hey you
Think I got a
A hole in my head
I think all the numbness
Finally sank in
It's making my
Head decay, head decay
When I walk by they screamin'
Isn't anybody home in there
Home in there, I know
When they wind me up
I can make it through
Hell and back, hell and back
You might also like[Refrain]
Me in my horror
A day in my horror
Me in my horror
Just a day in my horror

[Verse 2]
Roll right over out of bed
I don't even know what day it was
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Move so fast I have to ask
Did it happen, did I make it up?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just a story in my head
It's all a dream I keep on telling myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Some kind of death, but something left
Feel it blossoming inside my heart

[Refrain]
Me in my horror
A day in my horror
Me in my horror
Just a day in my horrorEmbed
