Rich Girl Mood Lyrics[Verse 1: Dounia]
Lately it's unclear what's weird and what's not
Don't be insecure, I ain't here for your spot
You some LA vibe, I'm the flyest on my block
Henny on the rocks and that shit do not stop
All the taboo convos becomin' so candid
She talkin' hundred racks that and 50 this
I'm on my rich girl mood, she do what she wants
You think these politics matter? Well shordey, clearly, they don't

[Chorus: Dounia with Kehlani]
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
We toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
They toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Rich girl, yeah, she get it and spend it
When it come to the stores she selective
Keep it real cool calm and collected
I'm biflexual; debit or credit? (Yuh)
I'm on a quality wave, every pic on my page
Keepin' me paid
You cut me open today, I'd prolly bleed chardonnay

[Chorus: Dounia with Kehlani]
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
They toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
They toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view

[Verse 3: Dounia]
And yeah she cute, but she not quite me
You think that you could compete, that's highly unlikely
Yeah you cute, but you not quite us
Creatively bankrupt, let me fill your tank up
I'm the bag, no gas, do it just like that
Angel chain 'round my neck, that's some rich girl swag

[Bridge: Kehlani]
Yeah, a bag is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag
Getting bags, getting bags, getting bags, getting bags, getting bags, getting bags, getting bags

I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
In my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag
We toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
'Cause a bag is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
In my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag, in my bag
We toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
'Cause a bag is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag, is a bag

[Verse 4: Kehlani]
Now every bitch is a bad bitch 'til she standing next to a badder bitch
And I ain't skip no steps, I hit every one on that ladder, bitch
You broke or you not, yeah your ass know that I am the latter sis
And I would sell you a fuck to give, but I just now ran out of it

[Bridge: Dounia]
I'ma do it like it's never been done
Unparalleled and I'm just having fun
I'ma do it like it's never been done
Unparalleled and I'm just having fun

[Chorus: Dounia with Kehlani]
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
They toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
I'm on my rich girl mood, what do rich girls do?
They toastin' on cloud 9, now that's a rich girl view
[Outro: Dounia]
Toasting on cloud 9 with some rich girl booze
If they sleeping on Douns, that's a rich girl snooze2Embed
