British Bombs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Great snakes, are we moving already?
Good gravy, did you say it cost a penny or two for you?
Well, talking 'bout the bad starts
My baby brother has already got a gas mask
'Cause it's a good old-fashioned landslide
Killing with your hands tied
In the homemade rope, set sail
Babe, we read it in The Mail, no hope now
[Chorus]
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's good what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen
[Verse 2]
Why does it seem
A fever dream for all?
The call you made to me
You said I fear
One day each year, I worry
We shall remember the dead
And we'll remember the dead so they know that we're sorry
But then carry on

[Chorus]
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen

[Verse 3]
How could it be the money? It's the vote that matters to me
You say you're hungry, but you won't eat the caraway seed
Doesn't matter in the wreckage, what should you say?
Well, I found myself a little peckish last Tuesday
This is what you signed up for, no questions
Reckon we could offer peacetime from weapons conventions
Well, it's on the table, but it's no game, can't you hear
All our worries for fear, carry on
You might also like[Chorus]
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen

[Bridge]
It's a good old-fashioned landslide
Killing with your hands tied
In the homemade rope, set sail
Babe, we read it in The Mail, no hope now
And it's a total fucking whitewash
The people that we might squash
And move from home soil, set sail
For wherever the fuck got oil this time
And if it's not a fucking war crime
It's a total waste of your time
And getting so much worse
Get real, kid, your country's been at war since birth now
And if it's not a fucking outrage, what's it all about, babe?
Now, it’s one on one
Great Britain's gonna tell you where it all went wrong and then carry on
[Chorus]
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen
Great way to fool me again, hun
Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
Great Britain won't stand for felons
Great British bombs in the Yemen26Embed
