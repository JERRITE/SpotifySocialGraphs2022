Hell and Back Lyrics[Intro]
(Do me, Doobie)

[Chorus]
I've been to hell and back
Truthfully, it ain't that bad
I walk with demons on my back
Let me tell you, it feels wonderful
Don't give me reasons to head back, back
I'll make you feel uncomfortable
You give me reasons to be mad, mad
But I think that's why I fuck wit' you
I just can't get enough ('Nough)
[Verse 1]
I ain't know how to love you, like I wanted to
Enough (Enough), of you
'Cause I'm done wit' you
Enough is enough
This time, I ain't coming back
I'ma leave you in the past
Keep your nose out of my pack
That's gonna kill my buzz real fast

[Bridge]
What you know about pain?
What you know about tears?
What you know about heartbreak?
What you know about fear?
What you know about pain? Tears?
What you know about heartbreak?
What you know about...

[Chorus]
I've been to hell and back
Truthfully, it ain't that bad (Mmm)
I walk with demons on my back
Let me tell you, it feels wonderful
Don't give me reasons to head back, back
I'll make you feel uncomfortable
You give me reasons to be mad, mad
That's-that's why I fuck wit' you (Fuck wit' you)
Doobie! I just can't get enough

[?] fell apart
I can hear 'em talking, hear the whispers in the dark
Bust it on a plate and cut it up with a card
I got too much on my plate to stomach, I'ma need a box
I got some molly rock that'll knock you out your socks
I'ma beat that box up, baby, I don't even box
Snotbox goin' numb, feel the drip from the drop
I done been to hell and back and it wasn't even hot
Sick of being broke, fill my pockets up with dust
Yeah, I fuck with shorty but we keep that on the...
What do my coke have in common with my wrist? They're both bust down
Shining through my struggle, I'm a diamond in the rough
It isn't what it was so it is what it is
Grab a fifth from the fridge so the pain won't exist
If it wasn't what it was, it would be what it was
Since I can't turn to you, I'ma turn to the drugs

[Chorus]
I've been to hell and back
Truthfully, it ain't that bad
I walk with demons on my back
Let me tell you, it feels wonderful
Don't give me reasons to head back, back
I'll make you feel uncomfortable
You give me reasons to be mad, mad
But I think that's why I fuck wit' you
I just can't get enough ('Nough)
[Outro]
I ain't know how to love you, like I wanted to
Enough of you
Done wit' you
Enough is enoughEmbed
