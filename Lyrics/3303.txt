Violation Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Ain't no more motherfuckin', "Wassup bro" with these niggas, man
As soon as you see these niggas these niggas wanna cop pleas

[Chorus]
I just woke up to the money today (Wake up)
Fuck all that demon shit, I'm 'bout to pray (God)
I really posted on blocks with these Ks (Blocks)
I'm thinking about putting some stock in the Braves (Stock)
Back up lil' bitch, you ain't bad enough (Back up)
All of my foreigns get mounted up (Mounted up)
Bust down my wrist, bitch I'm Patek'd up (Bust up)
Yellow skin bitch and she tatted up (Hey)
I pick out a foreign, got options (Foreign)
Get up your bag and you pop shit (Pop)
Gelato smell just like a moshpit (Moshpit)
No more vodka we sipping on active (Act)
[Verse]
I got more money than all of you niggas (Money)
If I feel like it's smoke, then I'm calling out niggas (Smoke)
Lil' nigga, lil' nigga, you act like you bigger (Huh)
Fuck all that Uzi, we give them the SIG gun (SIG)
Lil' boy, boy you ain't did nothin' (Lil' boy, boy)
30K shows, that's that kid money (Thirty ball)
Thankin' the lord what he did for me (God)
I thank him 'cause really I did something (Hey)
Keep that shit quiet though, keep that shit quiet
They really don't understand what I'm saying (Shh, shh, shh)
From the Nawfside, lot of Mexicans with grams (Nawf)
Lawrenceville High we got 85 vans (Woo)
A lot of big names we done put them on game (Game)
Quavo told me about you niggas locked up in the chains (Lames)
I don't upload a nigga but when I see you I'll expose you niggas
Niggas so young that I'm feeling like I'm a OG
At the top with the older niggas (OG)
Ten thousand racks wipe his nose, official (Racks)
Amsterdam, wrappin' a global figure (Woo)
And I got loads of figures (Loads)
It's all red, yeah, the coupe is a blister (Skrrt)
'Cause you're rich, lil' nigga ain't official (Nah)
You was broke, reading bricks, scared of pistols (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
I just woke up to the money today (Wake up)
Fuck all that demon shit, I'm 'bout to pray (God)
I really posted on blocks with these Ks (Blocks)
I'm thinking about putting some stock in the Braves (Stock)
Back up lil' bitch, you ain't bad enough (Back up)
All of my foreigns get mounted up (Mounted up)
Bust down my wrist, bitch I'm Patek'd up (Bust up)
Yellow skin bitch and she tatted up (Hey)
I pick out a foreign, got options (Foreign)
Get up your bag and you pop shit (Pop)
Gelato smell just like a moshpit (Moshpit)
No more vodka we sipping on active (Act)You might also like21Embed
