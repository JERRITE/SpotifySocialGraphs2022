Suave LyricsTell 'em that I'm way too suave (yeah tell 'em)
Tell 'em that I'm doin' OT (my crew)
Mixing that Morgan real smooth (smooth)
Tell 'em there's a party in the Woods (what's good)
(x2)

Stepped in quick you'll never miss me, this is my hood we throw it down like BG
Flick of my wrist when I connect ya
Cheddar your team, it ain’t safe, you call me Skepta

(Skepta)
I be schooling rappers like a lecture (like a lecture)
Call me santan Dave I'm the professor (yeah call me)
Call me skeng men 4, I'm like stormzy
Lowkey I've been doin' this since 14 (ahhoo)
On your bike when the swerve comes through Cuz
Stallyon hit it quick like a home run
Tracy, I be scoring points like McGrady
Haters they don't wanna see me be the greatest (ahhoo)

Bumbag got my loc’s in
The slogans 4 1 for the Logan
We show them we ain't here for the showing
'Cause we show out, we just came for the token
(came for the token)

Tell 'em that I'm way too suave (yeah tell 'em)
Tell 'em that I'm doin' OT (my crew)
Mixing that Morgan real smooth (smooth)
Tell 'em there's a party in the Woods (what's good)
(x2)

They say I'm not suave with this balaclava
But i'm still make it bust down Tatiana
Just wanna get paid no drama
This is my profession (ahhoo) like Sparta

We're goin' back to back like with Jordan
Miss me with that bull, you 'ready know who's most important
(yeah tell 'em)
NME, the MVP's been here for a minute we're taking over like them Hornets
You might also likeNo worries, we're going all in
No warning, killing 'em softly like Lauryn
Tell the waiter keep pouring and don't stop
Until my Uso's are Freeman like Morgan
(Dub 4)

They said we wouldn't get far
That's Kanye money comin' in, that's onways
Lemon with the bombay, chillin' with a bomb babe
Don't worry 'bout Andre, got 3000 reasons for you to come play

Tell 'em that I'm way too suave (yeah tell 'em)
Tell 'em that I'm doin' OT (my crew)
Mixing that Morgan real smooth (smooth)
Tell 'em there's a party in the Woods (what's good)
(x2)

Everyday I'm bound to impress her
Got her switching positions I'm a director
Light her up like it's Christmas in December
O.T Stally my name she will remember (remember)
We don't play ball like Hefner
NME take charge just like a Tesla
Never stalling we always keeping them revs up
They think we're loosing nah we gave them a head start
RB stay smoother than a criminal
Any slight diss I'll put the fun in your funeral (sheesh)
So let me say welcome to the party
I'll pop smoke I'm chef G on the barbie

Barbie she feeling Offset from the Cardi
Amigos taking off like a Rari, try me
Good at taking shots like Carly
Left her man now it's a break up party
