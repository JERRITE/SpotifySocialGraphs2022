Flickin’ Ash Lyrics[Intro]
Reminiscing, I'm flickin' ash out the window
I'm reminiscing, and I'm flickin' ash out the motherfuckin'—
I'm flickin' ash out the backseat window
I'm flickin' ash out the window

[Verse]
I'm reminiscing, flickin' ash out the window
I remember it was genuine
But now I feel I'm pushing an agenda
Got brothers in cells like Splinter now
Four in the ground and they spirits keep me up when I'm feelin' doubtful
I'm reminded, recollecting, all the memories we made
All the strength and wisdom
But what do I gotta do for me to win?
What do I gotta do to overcome and have it all make sense?
[Chorus]
Bеcause the pain is debilitating latеly
I've been hella anxious
Talkin' about how shit won't change
But I gotta keep digging up out of that mindset
I gotta remember to do my job here, it's not my time yet
But the pain is debilitating lately
I've been hella anxious
Talkin' about how shit won't change
But I gotta keep digging up out of that mindset
I gotta remember to do my job here, it's not my time yet

[Outro]
But the pain, but- but the- (I'm reminiscing, flickin' ash out the window)
(Flickin' ash out the window)
(I'm flickin' ash out the window)
(Out the backseat window)
Catch the ash that I'm flickin' out the motherfuckin-
(Reminiscing, reminiscing, reminiscing)You might also like3Embed
