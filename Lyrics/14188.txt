Bring My Baby Back LyricsI am a lonely one
But I could be loved
You are the only one
In radio swamp
This is the aftermath
Whatever I've done
Am I the only one
Still holding on

[Chorus: Dr. Dog]
Simple plea:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
A Judas Iscariot
Selling your own
Man on the radio
Selling you dope
Oh you're so afraid of me
But I could be loved oh, are we so tired of ourself?
In love with the radio

[Chorus : Dr. Dog]
Simple plea:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

This heart it burns in raging fire
I'm locking all my tears inside
No more time to sweep the floor
Only time to watch it burn
And I know
Now I've seen it through the flames
Living off the fire and God I know I'm better off

[Chorus : Dr. Dog]
Simple plea:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

Featureless smoke
Love is just static, (yeah)
Love is a joke. (yeah)
But fate is hilarious
Does what he wants
Swinging truck and a hitch from the rafters
Dragging his tail through the swamp

Simple plea: Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me

[Chorus: Dr. Dog]
Simple plea:
Make them pay and make them bring my baby back to me
Oh, make them pay and make them bring my baby back to meEmbed
