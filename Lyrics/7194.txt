Donâ€™t Wanna Be Your Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Such long days and longer nights
Visions running through my mind
How'd it feel to be with you
So much easier to hide
Than to face what we might find
There'd be so much less to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the more that we fight it we drown
The more we deny it, it comes out
The more we stay quiet it gets loud, it gets loud
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
I'm so tired of pretending we don't have feelings
Oh, I know you feel it
I don't wanna be the ones who
Always have their tones or I rather blow it
Than be left unknowing

[Verse 2]
All this wasted energy
It doesn't come for free
But I still can't let go
And the only step that's left
Is to get this off our chest
I don't know why you won't?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the more that we fight it we drown
The more we deny it, it comes out
The more we stay quiet it gets loud, it gets loud

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
I'm so tired of pretending we don't have feelings
Oh, I know you feel it
I don't wanna be the ones who
Always have their tones or I rather blow it
Than be left unknowing

No, I don't wanna be your
No, I don't wanna be your friend
No, I don't wanna be your friend
No, I don't wanna be your
No, I don't wanna be your friend
No, I don't wanna be your
No, I don't wanna be your friendEmbed
