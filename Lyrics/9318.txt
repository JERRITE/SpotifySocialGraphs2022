Rumours in the Air LyricsUsed to call me
By my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Used to say
I was your only flame
It was so simple
I believed it all

Now I hear
You've got a new friend and lover
Who keeps you warm
On the cool cool nights
There's a rumor in the air
Don't seem right
Rumours in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right
Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumours
Rumors in the air

Used to call me
When you felt the pain
Now you never even feel it at all
Used to swear
That we would never change
And like a fool
I believed it all

Now you say
You had a weekend of trouble
As you stare me down
With those cool cool eyes
There's a rumor in the air
Don't seem right

Rumours in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right
Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumours Rumours
Rumors in the air
You might also likeUsed to call me
By my first name
Now you never even call me at all
Now you say
That I'm the one to blame
Doesn't matter
How I feel at all

Well I hear
You've got a new friend and lover
You'll take him down
It's so plain to see
Well there's a rumor in the air
Killing me

Rumours in the air
Like a thief in the night
Taking more than their share
Taking more than their right
Rumors in the air
Like a thief in the night
Rumours Rumours
Rumors in the air

Rumors in the air (x3)
Rumors (x3)
Rumors in the airEmbed
