Kids in the Summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
My grandma tell me that I still look young
But my little cousin thinks I'm turning thirty-one
You know she only six-and-three-months
And you can't forget the months
Got me missing what it meant to grow up, yeah
I used to air up my tires, ride my bike to the park
Capri Sun me with friends, play ball 'til it's dark
You know them sleepovers, yeah, where ain't nobody sleep
'Cause if you did, you'd get the sharpie on your cheek
Man, I'm talkin' like:
Back then, it's like we always had plans
Mama used to make me listen to them clean versions
And we'd rock with no girls at the middle school dance
We making beats with our pencils, even way back then
I'm talking, yeah
Man, we grew up sharing plates
Now we all living in different states
My little homie Tanner had a pool
His parents were hella cool
We couldn't wait until the last day of school
[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart
I won't let her
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's like we fourteen, now we all growned up
Big high schoolers now, we all cell-phoned-up
I used to text my old girl 'til my minutes were up
The first time we all drank, we done all throwned up
I'm talking, yeah
A get together at the crib
His parents were out of town, got a ride from my friends
We had some girls come over, ain't nobody sober
That's the first day I figured out what hungover meant (shooby dooby doop)
You know
Back then, it's like we always had plans (shooby dooby doop)
Used to wake up late for school, so I rocked sweatpants (shooby dooby doop)
The only thing that made it better: if I had class with my friends (shooby dooby doop)
Aw damn, we didn't study -- we crammed
You know I'm talking 'bout the cheap beer and vodka
Kisses at the locker
Prom night was tight, but the pics were hella awkward
Yeah: smoking weed, spraying cologne
Parents ask how I am when I'm home
You might also like[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better" (I ain't ever been better)
This summer won't break my heart (break my heart)
I won't let her
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber (I wanna be dumber)
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm thirty-five with a wife and a kid
Coming home to see my parents, we ain't spoke in a grip
We hit the local spot, coffee shop -- table at the front
I ain't gotta peep the menu, I know what I want already, yeah
And, as we saying goodbye, I think I see my homie outside
My childhood friend, growing up since I was ten:
"I ain't seen you in forever, Cole, how you been?"
He said: "Brother, I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
I ain't ever been better"
Yeah
This summer won't break my heart, it won't break my heart
I won't let her
Yeah, yeah
And now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the summer
[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart (It won't break my heart)
I won't let her, yeah
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the--

[Outro]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good, I'm great --
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart, it won't break my heart
I won't let her, yeah
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be--
Yeah, I wanna be--
Yeah, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the summer3Embed
