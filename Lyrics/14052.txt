Set to Attack Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was so quiet
But you were excited
Waiting for romance
Someone come talk to me
Lonely out on this tree
There is a need to feel safe
How do we get to this place?
With eyes on my back, I'm set to attack
I've come to take your hand
[Chorus]
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

[Post Chorus]
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do with you

[Verse 2]
I was so quiet
But you were excited
Waiting for the dance
They all just waltzed in
A second behind me
I stood there like some dumb kid
The music played and the boys would take you
Far from where I was
I was still hoping that you were the victory
To what I felt like love

[Chorus]
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
You might also like[Post Chorus]
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do with you

[Chorus]
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on4Embed
