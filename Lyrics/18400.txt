Join Em Lyrics[Verse]
I know a nigga that's gon' love me for life
He love my mind and I was fucking him right
I had to cut off his lights
I met another nigga, he in the life
Gave me some racks, I ain't even gave him the pussy, say he supported the grind
I found out he playing hubby and wife
You know the drill, I took his money and left, I can't be playing the side
I make a nigga put his pride to the side
Talk to 'em bad 'cause ain't no ho in my vibe
I put myself in a riot
I ain't them bitches sucking dick to survive
Boy, I get paid to spend an hour outside
And, baе, I'm always outside
My new nigga tryna take mе to Turks
He in his feelings 'cause I don't text him back, say he ain't tryna get hurt
Ayy, I met an owner around the corner
He eating pussy and I ain't even put it on him
And the body still smoking marijuana
I got thick, baby, better yet, let me show ya
Ayy, back to my love, he was playing, had a bitch in his home, mm
Talking 'bout he pimping, boy, you doing it wrong
I know a P been fucking with him, he can't leave me alone
I gave him pussy, now he tryna turn his house to a home
I probably led him on, know I'll probably leave him
A nigga playing with me, know I gotta get even
I don't got feelings, yeah, I know I'm misleading
Seen a nigga this morning, seen another this evening
Ayy, and I don't wanna risk another nigga cheating
So I say join 'em if you can't beat 'em
I don't wanna risk another nigga cheating
I say join 'em if you can't beat 'em
Ayy, let me circle back, I was moving too fast
He ain't my nigga, he ain't fly me first class
He ain't my nigga, he ain't buy me that bag
He ain't my nigga, he ain't popping no tags
Let me give you hoes the game
We ain't fucking with no nigga wearing other niggas' chains
We ain't fucking with no nigga with no baby on the way
We ain't fucking with no nigga that ain't got nowhere to lay
Bitch, what a nigga gotta say?
I don't wanna hear that shit, I wanna put it in your face
I would never fuck a nigga first date
And we ain't fucking 'less that pussy get ate
Okay
I don't care what no nigga or no poor kid say
Talking 'bout some bitches tryna get a couple plays
I really think these niggas wanna switch places
Wouldn't be surprised if they start beating they faces
Ooh, playing in our laces
Always on that Twitter in them Spaces
It's giving basic
Old nothing-ass ho
Ayy, staying with your mama-ass ho
Always causing problems-ass ho
I ain't got no commas-ass ho
Fuck these niggas, I say fuck these niggas
They wonder why I don't be fucking with 'em
Bitch, they wonder why I don't be fucking with 'em
[Outro]
I say join 'em if you can't beat 'emYou might also likeEmbed
