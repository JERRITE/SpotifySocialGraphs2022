Hold On Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another night and here we are again
All our faults laid out ahead
Let it out, then let it right back in
All those voices in your head

[Pre-Chorus]
And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave
So I'll tell you what you need

[Chorus]
First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever
[Verse 2]
Lay down all your troubles end to end
They could reach up to the stars
So many roads, you don't know where you've been
But you still know who you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I seem preoccupied, I'm wondering what to do
So here's my recipe for you

[Chorus]
First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave
So I'll tell you what you need

[Chorus]
First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever
Just take my hand; hold on forever
Hold on forever
Just take my hand; hold on foreverYou might also like1Embed
