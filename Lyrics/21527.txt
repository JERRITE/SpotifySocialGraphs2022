Recharge My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a few years of really tough broken relationships
I'm so beyond enough that I moved on past all the tears
Yeah, I took my energy
And it's been way too long
Love's been my enemy
You fill me with so much fear

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I'd never love again
I gave on what it could have been
Wanna feel that spark, I think I'm ready
I'm ready
[Chorus]
So, won't you recharge my heart, recharge my heart?
Maybe you can be the one, you can be the one to
Recharge my heart, rechargе my heart
Maybe you can be thе one, you can be the one
You can be the—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm done being all alone
I'm leaving it behind
I've been through all emotions
At least a hundred times
And I thought that I'd never love again
I gave on what it could have been
Wanna feel that spark, I think I'm ready
I'm ready

[Chorus]
So, won't you recharge my heart, recharge my heart?
Maybe you can be the one, you can be the one to
Recharge my heart, recharge my heart
'Cause I've been empty for so long, empty for so long (Yeah)

[Chorus 2]
If there's a chance for you to plug me in (Plug me in)
Oh, would you try to make me full again?
So, won't you recharge my heart, recharge my heart?
Maybe you can be the one, you can be the one
You can be the—

Give me your energy and fill me with your light
One spark is all I need to bring me back to life
Give me your energy and fill me with your light
One spark is all I need to bring me back to life

[Chorus]
Recharge my heart, recharge my heart
Maybe you can be the one, you can be the one to
Recharge my heart, recharge my heart
'Cause I've been empty for so long, empty for so long (Yeah)

[Chorus 2]
If there's a chance for you to plug me in (Plug me in)
Oh, would you try to make me full again?
So, won't you recharge my heart, recharge my heart?
Maybe you can be the one, you can be the one
You can be the oneEmbed
