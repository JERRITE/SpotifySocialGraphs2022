Letâ€™s Work It Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say what you need now you're through
It's up to me, not to you
Now I'm asking you to leave
I can hardly breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Go away, go away
It's a magic
I jumped on board
I wasn't thinking about anything
[Chorus]
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out

[Verse 2]
There's no way I can compare
To this love affair
I know this is the last time
Cause you will never be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Go away, go away
It's a magic
I jumped on board
I wasn't thinking about anything

[Chorus]
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out

[Bridge]
Oh My God
I'm not in love with you anymore
Now this is my time
I changed my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life it's too short, let's work it outEmbed
