Every Morning Lyrics[Intro]
Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

[Verse 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin'
Stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again
[Chorus]
(Sugar Ray say)
Oh
(Every mornin')
Oh
(Every mornin' when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh
(She always rights the wrong, she always rights, she always rights)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Verse 2]
Every mornin' there's a heartache hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' so deceiving, when you stop believin'
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
Oh
(Every mornin')
Oh
(Every mornin' when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh
(Every mornin')
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

She always rights the wrong
For me
Baby
She always rights the wrong
For me

[Verse 3]
Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

[Chorus]
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Every mornin'
Every mornin' when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every mornin'
Every mornin'
(Turn me around again)
Every mornin'
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Every mornin'
(Do it again)
Every mornin' when I wake up
Every mornin'3Embed
