Silkk da Shocka Lyrics[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, I almost got this
If she got it memorized
This for the haves and the have-wanna-give-a-fucks
Hey

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad & Syd]
I ride around in your car
I put my weed in your blunt
I am the sky to your star
I am the end of your month
You are the start of my day
You brought the smile from my face
I see the world from your eyes
You pulled a thorn from my side
[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad, Syd, & Both]
I know you love me (Know you love me)
It's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)
Oh yeah, I know you love me (Know you love me)
It's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad & Syd]
You give me all that you got
You make it stretch it and flip
I fell in love with your thoughts
I learned it's more than your hips
You know I'm caught in my vibe
But I still give you my rib
You hear 'em callin' my name
But know it's hard for me here
I left a home with my son
I chose the world in the end
I say, "You know I be back"
You try your best to pretend
I say you all that I want
And when I make it, it's real
I hear 'em callin' my name
It's gettin' hard for me here

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad, Syd, & Both]
To know you love me (Know you love me)
It's rare to know you love me (Know you love me)
But yeah, I know you love me (Know you love me)
It's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)

Yeah, yeah, and, and these stars
Are nothin' but your cousins
And starin' at your mama, Heaven wasn't fallin' in here
So holla, you heard I'm usin' narcotics
No, I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few gripes but it's only 'bout a dollar bill
So holla unless you're usin' narcotics
See, I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few bitches but it's only 'bout a dollar
Feel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics
See, I don't wanna—

[Outro: Dave Free]
Say, homie. Man, you talkin' bout this, you talkin' bout that
Talkin' about, you ain't got nothin' to talk about. Man, my—Find a motherfuckin' topic, Goddamn. Just find the topic, bro. Seriously. Goddamn. Complicated-ass young motherfuckers, man.21Embed
