Siren Song Lyrics[Intro]
Komm zu mir
Komm zu mir
Komm zu mir
Komm zu mir

[Verse 1]
Come to me, come to me
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Boy we can get on
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
[Pre-Chorus]
Falling in through the floor
Baby, this is devil's door
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret

[Chorus]
Bang!
I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy

[Post-Chorus]
Falling in through the floor
Baby this is devil's door

[Verse 2]
Come to me, come to me
You're the only one
Give me love, give me love
From dusk till dawn
Come to me, come to me
Following my voice
Give me love, give me love
You don't have a choice
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know me
We'll take it really slowly
Falling in through the floor
Ask the devil's door
You gotta know me
Just get the rythm slowly
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret

[Chorus]
Bang!
I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me boy
