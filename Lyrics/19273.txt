RACECAR Lyrics[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down like my ceiling
I don't have none, have none
Yeah, yeah

I need racecar, top down to match my ceiling
I don't have none, have none, dollar billies in my bag
Run— bag, run, fuck your feelings, I de—14Embed
