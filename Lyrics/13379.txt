Unlovable Lyrics[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
So many lovers, but I haven't found the
One to fix my heart, mm-hmm
So many chances that I'm runnin' out of
Now I'm in the dark

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
I've been looking for the one to take me as I am
I'm a broken mess, I must confess that late at night
I wonder is there anybody out there
[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Who could love me?
Could anybody love me at all?
So used to being lonely
Could anybody love me at all?
Could anybody love me?
Could anybody love me at all?
So used to being lonely
Could anybody love me at all?

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Uh, I fear commitment
Can't stay in one placе, and
So vulnerable, yeah-еah
Fit the description
Some people say I'm unlovable

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Still I'm looking for the one to take me as I am
I'm a broken mess, I must confess that late at night
I wonder is there anybody out there

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Who could love me?
Could anybody love me at all?
So used to being lonely
Could anybody love me at all?
Could anybody love me?
Could anybody love me at all?
So used to being lonely
Could anybody love me at all?You might also like1Embed
