Oohla Oohla LyricsWhen I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla, oohla, oohla, oohla!"
When you move fancy, make me wanna holla, holla, holla, holla
I got your attention spending that mula, mula, mula, mula
And the club bumping, party swola, swola, swola, swola

When I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla, oohla, oohla, oohla!"
When you move fancy, make me wanna holla, holla, holla, holla
I got your attention spending that mula, mula, mula, mula
And the club bumping, party swola, swola, swola, swola

Oh yeah
Oh, oohla, oohla
Oohla got me feeling like this
And oohla something I can't resist
Tune gonna make me fade out like get out
Let's get it on now, let's get it on now, oohla, oohla

When I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla, oohla, oohla, oohla!"
People looking fancy, got me like hula, hula, hula, hula
You got it going on, you got it going on, oh yeah
Let's get it on now, let's get it on now, give me that oohla, oohla

When I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla, oohla, oohla, oohla!"
When you move fancy, make me wanna holla, holla, holla, holla
I got your attention spending that mula, mula, mula, mula
And the club bumping, party swola, swola, swola, swola

When I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla, oohla, oohla, oohla!"
When you move fancy, make me wanna holla, holla, holla, holla
I got your attention spending that mula, mula, mula, mula
And the club bumping, party swola, swola, swola, swola

I love it, I feel it
Oh, I can't resist now
I feel it, I love it now
All of it now, ooh

When I see you dancing I'm like "Oohla- (What the f***?!)
