Daddy Lessons LyricsCame into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me (Oh, oh, oh)
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea

And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
That's when daddy looked at me
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do (Oh, oh, oh)
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Oh, oh, oh)

Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said "Girl it's your second amendment"
He always played it cool, but daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said, "Remember..."

He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
That's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do (Oh, oh, oh)
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Oh, oh, oh)

He said "Baby girl he's playing you, he's playing you"
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said "Baby girl he's playing you, he's playing you" (Oh, oh, oh)
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot3Embed
