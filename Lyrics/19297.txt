Need Someone Lyrics[Intro]
I think you're... great (yeah)
But, I'm so sorry
I just don't...
Think that right now is a good time

[Verse 1]
Said you need a change
That it's time to turn the page
And even though you still love me
Your heart's in another place
Wish that I could make you stay
Wish there was something I could say
And all my friends tell me that
Lately, I ain't been the same, no
'Cause this pain in my chest is draggin' me down
I'm tryin' to fix it but I don't know how
Drinkin' my sorrows, but that shit don't help
And can't hide the fact that I'm stuck by myself
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think I'm askin' too much
I want someone to hold
Grab on my body
Say they'll never let go

[Chorus]
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care
I just want someone to trust me, trust me
And tell me that they scared
I just need someone to touch me, touch me
Like I'm the only one
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care

[Verse 2]
All these feelings I ignore
What's the point? Been here before
I've tried a million times
Something's missing, that's for sure, yeah
People tell me that I changed
How could I ever be the same?
I gave up everything over and over again
Done with the hurt, fought through the lies
Surrounded by killers with real loves disguised
Lost in appearance, don't care what's inside
As fast as they meet you, they sayin' goodbye
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think I'm askin' too much
I want someone to hold
Grab on my body
Say they'll never let go

[Chorus]
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care
I just want someone to trust me, trust me
And tell me that they scared
I just need someone to touch me, touch me
Like I'm the only one
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care
I just want someone to trust me, trust me
And tell me that they scared
I just need someone to touch me, touch me
Like I'm the only one
I just need someone to love me, love me
I just need someone to care6Embed
