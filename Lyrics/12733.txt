TranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisDecode Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight all the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides?
But you won't take away my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
No, not this time
Not this time
[Chorus]
How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well
But how did we get here?
Well, I think I know

[Verse 2]
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out

[Pre-Chorus]
On my own
(I'm screaming, "I love you so")
On my own
(But my thoughts you can't decode)

[Chorus]
How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well (Yeah-heh)
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves

[Break]
Yeah, yeah-eh-heh-eh

[Chorus]
How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well (Yeah-eh, yeah-heh-heh-eh)
Well, how did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well

[Post-Chorus]
I think I know
I think I know

[Outro]
Ooh, there is something
I see in you
It might kill me
I want it to be true57Embed
