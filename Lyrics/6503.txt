Golden Boy Lyrics[Intro]
This is Drain members only

[Chorus]
Bleeding from my Prada shoes like they raw
I always been real with you from the start
Tryna hold it in my hand but it falls apart
Yeah, it falls apart, tearing us apart
I'm just tryna play the game but it's joker cards
I'm just drinking Ace of Spades like it's no tomorrow
Coach put me in the game and I'm going hard
I'ma strike the ball, going to the stars
[Verse]
Home run, yeah, I go like six hundred yards
They want give me a red card when I hit the mall
Fendi scarf around my arms, bleeding from my palms
Drain show in a black car with 'bout twenty guards
There's a voice in the night, I can hear it call
Night call, you know I pick up, wanna hear you whisper
I know 'bout the water but the blood coming thicker
In your dream, its a scripture, I take it like a picture
Find out what you on and parasite you
I see light blue but sometimes it's pink too
I can be your fog, you'll be my queen like it's England
I'm just tryna kick it, trust me like religion
Find out what's your shape and then I'm shifting
Toxic waste, I'm glitching, trapped in my own prison
I can't live without you like nutrition
Catch you when I'm blinking, want you like I'm Jason
Four, five rings on like a mason
Feeling like I'm Jordan, three point, yeah, I'm scoring
I might get it late or in the morning
Hit you with a forehand, I been laying dormant

[Outro]
Beat the evil like a holy one
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden one
Beat the evil like a holy one
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden one
Beat the evil like a holy one
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden boy
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden boy
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden boy
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden boy
You make me feel like the golden one
You make me feel like the golden boy
You make me feel like the golden oneYou might also like12Embed
