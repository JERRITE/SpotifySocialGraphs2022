Best Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need to know about this, babe
Cause I can't sleep at night
The conversation that we had
Something just feels right

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've known each other a long time
But I've never seen you in this light
I can see the future in your eyes
Longing for a love and I realize
[Chorus]
You are the one I want
(You are, you are)
The one I'm thinking of
(You are, you are)
I think that we can have more
(You are, you are)
We'll have what we deserve
(You are)

[Hook]
Best kind of love
Mmm... and you know that I want it
(Best kind of love)
Best kind, best kind
(Best kind of love)
And you know
And you know that I've got it
(Best kind of love)
You're the best kind of love

[Verse 2]
I guess it's not too much to ask
If you feel the same
We can build something that will last
No more playing games
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've known each other a long time
I never thought I'd wanna make you mine
Call me up before you sleep at night
I know you have me lingering in your mind

[Chorus]
You are the one I want
(You are, you are)
The one I'm thinking of
(You are, you are)
I think that we can have more
(You are, you are)
We'll have what we deserve
(You are)

[Hook]
Best kind of love
Mmm.. and you know that I want it
(Best kind of love)
Best kind, best kind
(Best kind of love)
And you know
And you know that I've got it
(Best kind of love)
You're the best kind of love
[Bridge]
I want it, I want it
I want, I want, I want, I want it
I want, I want, I want, I want it
I want, I want, I want, I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've known each other a long time
But I've never seen you in this light
Call me right before you sleep at night
I know you got me lingering in your mind

[Chorus]
You are the one I want
(You are, you are)
The one I'm thinking of, thinking of
(You are, you are)
I think, I think that we can have more
(You are, you are)
We'll have what we deserve
(You are)

[Outro]
Best kind of love
Ooo... and you know that I want it
(Best kind of love)
The best kind, the best kind of love
(Best kind of love)
And you know
And you know that I need it
(Best kind of love)
You're the best kind of love4Embed
