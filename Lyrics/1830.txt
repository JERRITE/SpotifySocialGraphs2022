Girl with the Tattoo Enter.Lewd Lyrics[Verse]
Those innocent eyes
That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you
If they only knew
The girl with the tattoo
Like I do
Doing what you're doing, just to get you where you're going
Yeah, I see it, baby
Just don't lose yourself along the way, no
'Cause you're doing what you're doing
Just to get you where you're goin' and I see it, baby
Ain't too many others gon' ask you to say, "I do"
But I knew
The girl with the tattoo, yeah
Oh yeah, I knew
The girl with the tattoo
I used to knowYou might also like45Embed
