Sidewalk Safari Lyrics[Verse 1]
All of the bones in your body
Are in way too few pieces for me
Time to do something about it
If you know what I mean
I'm on a sidewalk safari
If I see you on the street, you'd better run
Away from my all-terrain weapon
In your direction
[Refrain]
In your direction
In your direction
In your direction

[Verse 2]
I'm on a sidewalk safari
If I see you on the street, you'd better run
You should have taken a taxi
In your direction

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna hunt you down
(In your direction)
I'm gonna run you down
(In your direction)
I'm gonna run you down
(In your direction)
I'm gonna hunt you down

[Bridge]
I'm bad with bows and arrows
I'm not so good at guns
Poison seems old-fashioned
And hired help's no fun
But I do know how to drive a car
Faster than a man can run
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gonna hunt you down
I'm gonna run you down
(In your direction)
I'm gonna run you down
(In your direction)
I'm gonna hunt you down
(In your direction)
(In your direction)3Embed
