NBA JAM Lyrics[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
In the coupe, got baggage
And your heart, I'ma stab it
Hoppin' out of the Banshee
And the bitch won't banish
Got a check, ain't manage, outlandish
Do the hit with a mask
Shooter got basket (Bah), so blood, got it brackin' (Suwoop)
I get pussy, man, fuck Carole Baskin, I might mate with a bitch in Alaska
So much ice in my wrist got pneumonia all up in my arm (Suwoop)
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard (Woah)
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard (Woah)
[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, how you gon' do that? Why you gon' shoot like a nigga won't shoot back?
Broad day, bitch, and you know we don't do that, be in the picture, lil' nigga, I drew that
Hang with killers that'll draw down, when we in the city, we bringin' the block out
We got them Glocks out, we always had 'em, still send them shots now
Oh, he a opp now, always been one, I just didn't know the shit
Don't give a fuck now, I put my mom in some Prada and Rick
Oh, he a ghost now, hope you could talk to the dead, lil' bitch
Hope that he spoke loud, hope that you know everything that you spoke 'bout
Know that it's smoke now, know that we bringin' the muhfuckin' folks out
I'm an animal, I hang with gorillas and vipers, know I'm a goat now
Put on a show now, know that we come through and muhfuckin' show out
Bringin' them bowls out, you know we got racks, we bringin' the Rolls out (Haha, what the fuck?)
Ayy (Woah)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
In the coupe, got baggage
And your heart, I'ma stab it
Hoppin' out of the Banshee
And the bitch won't banish
Got a check, ain't manage, outlandish
Do the hit with a mask
Shooter got basket (Bah), so blood, got it brackin' (Suwoop)
I get pussy, man, fuck Carole Baskin, I might mate with a bitch in Alaska
So much ice in my wrist got pneumonia all up in my arm (Suwoop)
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard (Woah)
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard
Hundreds bands in my car, hundred bands on my yard (Woah)

Fuck what they sayin', they nothin' like us
I speak to dogs [?] like pills, I promise it ain't nothin' to do with Elon Musk
Better not get in that pool with that chain on your neck you know it's gon rust

Ah, ride a round town [?] in the grass
I never tried to fix shit from my past
Gotta take care of my niggas who crashed
Cashin' out, I do the [?]
Talkin' the talk, walkin' the walk, I'm still on the curb like chalk, huh
Tell these pussy niggas you is nothin' like us
Nigga, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, what the fuck you think this is?
Every car I drive I bought
Got my first M I was only eighteen, nigga, I was feelin' like Nas
And we spendin' guap like it's playin' cards
Walk with the mop like a janitor
Cartiers on like I'm India, dee
