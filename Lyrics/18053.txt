You Shouldnâ€™t Have Said That Lyrics[Verse 1]
You shouldn't have said that
At least not without warning
I've been such a wreck
Always scared that I'm boring
You swallow my words
Cause they're not that important
You shouldn't have said that
And think I'd ignore it

You shouldn't have called me
You knew that I'd answer
My vision is spinning
My heart is a hammer
Before we ignite this
I brace for the fallout
Too close to the ceiling
I wait for the comedown
[Chorus]
And you shouldn't have called me pretty and think I'd forget it
My memory's shitty but god it's selective

[Verse 2]
You shouldn't have said that
And think that I'd read it
Then after a minute
Forget that I'd seen it
The spell's gonna break
If I start to believe it
You shouldn't have sent that
If you didn't mean it
St-st-stutter around you
Called a speech pathologist
She said to fuck off
And see my psychologist
Looked for distractions
I found none at college
Just rich kids from Jersey
And part-time astrologists
Still thought about you but now I know communists

[Chorus]
And you shouldn't have called me pretty and think I'd forget it
My memory's shitty but god it's selective
You might also like[Bridge]
And there's blood in the water
I'll wait 'til the faucet runs clear
And you shouldn't have said that and think I'd pretend not to hear
Oh baby there's blood in the water
I'll wait 'til the faucet runs clear
And you shouldn't have said that and think I'd pretend not to hear

[Outro]
It looms but the promise
This cloud that I'm under
I'm quick as the lightning
And sure as the thunder
The silence between
Beating slow like a death march
But just for a second
It's light 'til it gets dark1Embed
