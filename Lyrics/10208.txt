Talking to Myself (Stripped) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a movie that you can quote almost every line
Like a T-shirt that you have washed 'bout a hundred times

[Pre-Chorus]
I got used to your voice
Like it was my own
Now there's kind of a void
I'm totally fine though

[Chorus]
This is the part where I
Start losing my damn mind
This house is way too quiet
And I know the walls would never tell
Lately I've been talking to myself
What if I play pretend?
You're holding me again
We're laughing in my head
But I know that there's nobody else
And I've just been talking, talking to myself
[Verse 2]
I could rеplay all your voicemails, but it's not the same
But at lеast then I could always hear you say my name

[Pre-Chorus]
I got used to your voice
Like it was my own
Now there's kind of a void
I'm totally fine though

[Chorus]
This is the part where I
Start losing my damn mind
This house is way too quiet
And I know the walls would never tell
Lately I've been talking to myself
What if I play pretend?
You're holding me again
We're laughing in my head
But I know that there's nobody else
And I've just been talking, talking to myself

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Talking to myself
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I made a list of all the things I couldn't tell you
Do you miss me? Are you talking to yourself, too?

[Chorus]
This is the part where I
Start losing my damn mind
This house is way too quiet
And I know the walls would never tell
Lately I've been talking to myself
What if I play pretend?
You're holding me again
We're laughing in my head
But I know that there's nobody else
And I've just been talking, talking to myself

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Talking to myself
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oohEmbed
