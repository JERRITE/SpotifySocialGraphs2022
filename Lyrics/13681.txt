Xâ€™s (Osrin Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Icona Pop]
I keep deleting X's when we message
'Cause I forget that things have changed
Now it's so different, now we're distant
But damn it, all of it feels so strange
Deleting X's, I don't get it
'Cause part of me still feels the same
And I keep forgetting you're the X I can't erase

[Chorus: Icona Pop]
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
So tell me if you feel the same
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
But since you've been away, oh-ay
Been thinking about the mess I made
'Cause you're the X I can't erase
[Verse 2: ?]
Now I'm deleting pictures, feelin' bitter
'Cause we're so happy that it hurts
We're still conversatin', but I hate it
And X's only make you worse
Deleting pictures, makes no differene
Remember saying thousand words
And I keep on missin'
I put you as the way you were

[Chorus: Icona Pop & ?]
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I'm in my head all day, oh-ay, oh-ay
Just wanting you to stay, oh-ay
So tell me if you feel the same
Yeah I don't know what to say, oh-ay, oh-ay
I don't know what's okay, oh-ay, oh-ay
But since you've been away, oh-ay
Been thinking about the mess I made
'Cause you're the X I can't erase
So tell me if you feel the same
So tell me if you feel the same

[Chorus: Icona Pop]
Yeah I don't know what to say
I'm in my head all day
Just wanting you to stay
So tell me if you feel the same
Yeah I don't know what to say
I don't know what's okay
But since you've been away
Been thinking about the mess I made
'Cause you're the X I can't erase
