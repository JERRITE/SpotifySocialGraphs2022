Hard Liquor Lyrics[Intro: The Game]
Dre you must've been of the Hennessy when you did this my nigga

[Chorus: Kokane]
Hard liquor
Hard liquor
Hard liquor
Is there anymore hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed
And twisted with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah
[Verse 1: The Game]
You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
Like niggas with dead homies till it's empty like my four pound
Niggas thinkin' I'm drunk, reach for my N.W.A chain
And get your ass beat with the pump
Tell security it's Game plus 50
Any problem he get fucked up every night like Bobby do Whitney
Fuck poppin' Cristal I got a bottle of Henny
Me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and Lil Penny
I ain't here so you can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like Beyonc√©
So let me be Hov' for a minute, get up in your ho for a minute
And you could be my ho for a minute
Like I'm Diddy, be J-Lo for a minute
From the windows to the wall gettin' low while I'm in it
All I gotta do is hit em with a JAY-Z line
Like you deserve to be my sunshine

[Chorus: Kokane]
See her on the Floor, she's sexy
Tell her where the after party is
But make sure that you see her friends before her
Before her, before her, hmm

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt
Then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire
I'm a gangsta ma' I wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks
Both hands round your ankles ma'
All I wanna see is ass and tits
Shake it like they do in magic city with T.I. in that mothafucka
I'm like 50, be high in this mothafucka
You see them gold Ds on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
My .45 to the back of your weave, both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head, see how you like getting fucked with a pistol to your head
Tell ya' girls how I fucked your brains out we can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out, bitch
You might also like[Chorus: Kokane]
See her on the Floor, she's sexy
Tell her where the after party is
But make sure that you see her friends before her
Before her, before her, hmm

[Verse 3: The Game]
I got 40's like the liquor store
Pour it on your weave like that bitch in the G-Thang video
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
I know you used to niggas spendin' but tonight I'm fuckin'
The truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck 'em
It's killa-Cali nigga, haters come a dime a dozen
Load them shells then I get drunk pissy
This bottle of Hennessy got me wantin' to fuck Missy
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out
Play with her pussy then drop ecstasy in her Cristal
60 seconds later I'm kickin' that bitch out
Then ride down the show with the .45th out
Stop at the store that bitch emptied my Cris out
Give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out
Niggas wanna know what this L.A. shit 'bout
Just visit when the Bloods and Crips' up

[Chorus: Kokane]
Is there anymore hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed
And twisted with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, on ice, on ice, yeah3Embed
