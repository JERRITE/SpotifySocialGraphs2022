Dear Depression Lyrics[Intro: Kamal & Essam]
Man, how's everything
Everything good, I'm good, I'm good, man, I'm good
You don't look yourself anymore man
Tell me what's wrong

[Verse 1: Essam]
Truth is my life is a mess
I’m sad and upset, sick and depressed
I got stress on my chest, man I’m sinking in debt
My relationships wrecked and it’s breaking my neck
And I can’t find a job, man I got nothing left
Asked me how I was, man I wish I was dead
I’m upset I’m upset, man I’m upset
[Verse 2: Kamal Saleh]
Woah, brother just breathe man, lift up your head
I understand what you mean – but don’t you forget
This life is a test, that’s what Allah said
He made life and death to test who was best in deeds
I mean what’d you expect
For it to be ease, for it to be rest
For us to just leave, for us to be left
To say that we believe without any tests?
Nah, of course it gets hard, as tests become large
But as hard as it gets, it doesn’t last

[Verse 3: Essam]
Brother I understand what you’re saying
I just don’t have the patience
I’m tired and anxious, I swear I can’t take this
I can feel myself breaking, I don’t know if God hates me
Because that’s what they say to me
I’m stressed and depressed 'cause apparently I’m low in Imaan?
Or it is as though I’m not reading the Qur'an
Man I’m trying my best, I’m just sick of it man
I don’t know why it’s happening to me, I just don’t understand

[Verse 4: Kamal Saleh]
Brother you just keep the doing the best that you can
And whatever happens, it happens it’s all in God’s plan
Just put your trust in Allah, it’s all in His hands
And ignore what they say 'cause they misunderstand
See Allah will test those that He loves
Just look at the best of the best, the Messenger of Allah
He had it so tough, he had it so rough, man he had it so hard
Yet despite it all, he was the most beloved

Brother I’m trying to believe, but I’m torn and I’m weak
See at night I can’t sleep, from all my worry and grief
It’s brought me to my knees
Then in that case you’re in the best place you can possibly be
To call upon your Lord in need
For verily in the remembrance of God, hearts finds relief
Brother please
I’m sorry you don’t know my story, you don’t know where I’ve been
Yeah – but I know that surely after every hardship comes ease
Surely after every hardship comes ease
So don’t lose hope and don’t you ever despair
And no matter how hard it gets
Allah will never burden your soul more than it can bear
I’m only saying this because I love you, Wallahi I swear
Thank you my brother, it’s good to have someone there
To have somebody by my side who actually cares
So I thank you for listening, just please keep on visiting
I’m sorry if I was bickering, I know have flaws
I just need your support
Brother this is exactly what Muslims are for
This is what the Prophet ﷺ he taught
So don’t be afraid to reach out for help
Don’t be ashamed to look out for your health
And know that in order to change, it starts with yourself
May Allah make it easy for you and everyone else
[Outro: Essam]
Praying for their souls, praying for their souls
I’m praying for their souls, praying for their soulsEmbed
