This Life I Have Lyrics[Intro]
I hate my life, I hate my friends
I hate the way The Notebook ends
I hate my job, I hate my car
I hate the cute girls at the bar
I hate my band, I hate my songs
I hate the kids that sing along
But worst of all
You made me hate the things I love

[Verse 1]
Now I love these drugs that numb the pain
I love the way your knuckles taste
I love the noises in my head
That tell me, "Nick, you should be dead"
But hey, this life that I've got's real
I'm reminded every day
That I will never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever be happy
[Verse 2]
That's how it goes
I'm just having a bad night, maybe
Yeah, maybe this could be alright
So much to live for I could die
I think that this could be the start of a new life

[Spoken]
(Oh, is this your new boyfriend?)
(Oh, sweet)

[Verse 3]
Now I hate myself, I hate my clothes
Hate that my facial hair won't grow
I hate my brain and how it thinks
I hate my narcissistic tendencies
My lovely shade of giving up
It takes so much to loosen up
So I'll pop another pill
And watch the world give up on me
Watch the world give up on me
Watch the world give up on me, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't deserve your attention
I don't deserve it one bit
I'm sorry if this song
Or if this show ain't what you wanted
You worked so many hours
Saving up so you could make it
'Til the website ripped you off
And went and bought up all the tickets
Now we're eye to eye
While I self-examine my pretty mind
My convoluted, pure depression
Your opinion, it haunts me
I just want you to want me
You might also like[Verse 4]
I want my life, I want it back
I want the good times that we had
So I'll just write when I feel down
And hope the masses sing aloud
I love these songs, I love our fans
I take back everything I said
Yeah I'll enjoy this life I have

[Outro]
This life I have
This life I have
This life I have
This life I have
This life I haveEmbed
