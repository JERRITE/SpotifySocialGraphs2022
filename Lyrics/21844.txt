I Still Love You Lyrics[Intro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah-yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ain't it strange how he called out your name?
I'm in silence again, can't remember when
I lost my will with it, guess too bad, is it?
But I'm letting go, I'm givin' in
[Chorus]
'Cause I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you
I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you (You)

[Verse 2]
I need to breathe, I need you to succeed
I'm in silence again 'cause this love within
I can't hurt the same, I'm immune to pain
If you break these chains, help me live again
If I'd known you could shoot, I would've said it was you
But you gave up soon, you made it seem true
I would risk my high if you risk yours again
Boy, I'm lettin' go, I'm givin' in

[Chorus]
'Cause I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you
I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you (You)

No one ever wants to say goodbye
We shoulda gave ourselves another try
Shoulda only be one thing, us against the wind
Now I only have myself to blame
And I cry beside this thing called rain
Wish our feelings never changed
But I'm lettin' go, I'm giving in

[Chorus]
I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you
I still love you (Please come back to me)
I still love you (He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you (You)

[Outro]
I still love you (Please come back to me)
Love (He's everything I need)
(You make my life complete)
I still love you, baby
Woo (Please come back to me)
(He's everything I need)
I still love you (You make my life complete)
I still love you, you5Embed
