Mx. Sinister Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, you never seem to notice when I follow you home
In the dark of your apartment when you think you’re alone

[Verse 2]
What would it take? What else should I do?
How far must I go to prove that I love you?

[Chorus]
And I’ll get you yet (I'll get you yet)
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister type
And I’ll get you yet (I'll get you yet)
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister type
[Verse 3]
Oh, you never seem to notice that my heart beats for you
So I’ll open you up, and make yours beat for me too

[Chorus]
And I’ll get you yet (I'll get you yet)
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister type
And I’ll get you yet (I'll get you yet)
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister
And I’ll get you yet
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister
And I'll get you, I'll get you yet
I’ve got to make you mine
Just know I’m not the sinister type

[Outro]
(I'll get you)
(I'll get you)
(I'll get you)
(I'll get you)You might also like24Embed
