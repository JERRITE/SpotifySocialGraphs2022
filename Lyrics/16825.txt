I Do Need You Lyrics[Intro]
Hey baby, I've been clockin' for a while and
Now's about time I tell you how I feel
Hoo-hoo-hoo

[Verse 1]
I know for sure
That you'll never change, mm
Why I continue to love you
The answer remains the same
[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I, do I cry?
When I know nothing will change
But if I keep holding on
Just maybe you'll see that I

[Chorus]
I do need you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I do want you (I need you and I want you)
I do need you (Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I do want you (I need you, hoo-hoo)

[Verse 2]
Deep in my heart
I feel that you really do care, oh
Is it true what they say, that, uh, actions speak louder than words?
And yours just isn't there, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I, do I cry?
When I know nothing will ever change
But if I keep holding on
Just maybe you'll see that I

[Chorus]
I do need you (I, oh)
I do want you (I need you, I do)
I do need you (I know for sure that I need)
I do want you (Need you, Lord have mercy)

[Outro]

I do want you
I do need you
I do want you1Embed
