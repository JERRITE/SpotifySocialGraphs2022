TranslationsPortuguÃªsDeutschOver Those Hills Lyrics[Verse 1]
Over those hills, I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills every night and in the morning
When you wake up, ever wish I was beside you?
We could look out together in those hills forever

[Verse 2]
Over those hills, I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills every night and in the morning
When you wake up (Wake up, wish I was), ever wish I was beside you? (Beside, beside you)
We could look out together in those hills forever, hmm
[Verse 3]
So this is the feeling
You can't imagine that it's real
'Til you feel it, oh
Almost went numb
Thought I'd had enough
But the hurt is half the fun

[Break]
Da, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra-ra, da, da-ra-ra, da-ra, da-ra-ra
Da, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra-ra, da

[Outro]
