Keep On Dreaminâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every other city we go
Every single radio has gone away
And it isn't coming back, isn't coming back
The city isn't what it seems
Alien subway scenes, please go away
And never come back, never come back

[Chorus]
Go for a stroll in the park
Keep my mind in the dark
Nothing matters, no how
Keep on dreamin' now
[Verse 2]
Every single day the same
Cloudy with a chance of rain
I'm not the only one
Who never gets back, never gets back, no
Barely see the light of day
Workin' my life away
God knows I'm done
And I'll never get it back, never get it back

[Chorus]
Go for a stroll in the park
Keep my mind in the dark
Nothing matters, no how
Keep on dreamin' now
Bye-bye
If I killed it, might cry
Not that I even know how
Keep on dreamin' now

[Chorus]
Go for a stroll in the park
Keep my mind in the dark
Nothing matters, no how
Keep on dreamin' now
Bye-bye
If I killed it, might cry
Not that I even know how
Keep on dreamin' nowYou might also like1Embed
