Hold Onto My Heart LyricsYou don't remember all the times that you've been sad
You don't know how it feels when my heart is beating fast
Oh but I do
You don't know what you're gonna dream about tonight
You don't know how you look in imaginary white
Oh but I do, Oh but I do

So let's dive into the great unknown
Rip out the pages; let life unfold
Cause darlin' you can hold onto my heart
We can rewrite time; break the hourglass
Burn all the rules; scatter the ash
Darlin' you can hold onto my heart
You don't know how you look when you don't know what to wear
Standing on your toes holding up your hair
Oh but I do
No one else has got me lifted off the ground
Dizzy with the way my world is twirling upside down
The way that you do, oh the way that you do

So lets dive into the great unknown
Rip out the pages; let life unfold
Cause darlin' you can hold onto my heart
We can rewrite time; break the hourglass
Burn all the rules; scatter the ash
Darlin' you can hold onto my heart
Darlin' you just hold onto my heart
Darlin' you hold onto my heartYou might also likeEmbed
