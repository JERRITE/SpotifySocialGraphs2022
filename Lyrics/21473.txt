Soul 4 Sale Lyrics[Verse 1]
C'mon baby listen, there's some things you oughta know
I looked up how this love plays out and where it's gonna go
Don't tell me that I'm different, although you can try to show me
Other ways to go about it, I already know
This is a relationship in which I make a sacrifice
You take the cut and split it up and leave the body paralyzed
Unable to break free of it, til it's too late to realize
That's just what you gotta do, you take the ride, you pay a price

[Chorus]
Hey!
What do you want me to say?
Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!
What do you want me to be?
Show me 'cause I want it
Give you everything you want now
Give me everything you need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
[Verse 2]
For forty days and forty nights, you worked up to seduce me
I listened to the lyrics of your songs 'cause they'd amuse me
That sing-along did not last long; it started to reduce me
To a puppet on the shelf, just screamin':
"Puppetmaster, choose me!"
So come on baby, come and love me like a kamikaze
We'll go down in flames together, light it up like paparazzi
Callin' out my name the fame
The flames are all one and the same
So sign me up to love you, 'cause I'm ready for the game

Oh!

[Chorus]
Hey!
What do you want me to say?
Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!
What do you want me to be?
Show me 'cause I want it
Give you everything you want now
Give me everything you need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh!
Give me everything, give me everything
Sign on the line
Make a deal with the devil
Make a deal with the devil in blood

Sign on the line
Make a deal with the devil
Make a deal with the devil in blood
I know your love is bad but I want it all

[Chorus]
Hey!
What do you want me to say?
Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!
What do you want me to be?
Show me 'cause I want it
Give you everything you want now
Give me everything you need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Hey!
What do you want me to say?
Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!
What do you want me to be?
Show me 'cause I want it
Give you everything you want now
Give me everything you need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale

Hey!
What do you want me to say?
Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!
What do you want me to be?
Show me 'cause I want it
Give you everything you want now
Give me everything you need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale

[Outro]
Hey!

Tell me, I already
Gave you everything you want now
Give me everything I need
I got a soul for sale, a soul for sale
Oh!Embed
