Ahh, ahh
Welcome to the I-20
Ahh what is it, uhhhh
Three nine, seven six nine, I-20 Dallas, Texas, what is this, seven five, two three seven? Something like that?
Yeah, you feel me, something like that
[Verse]
I think I found some old lyrics, listen to this
You're all so stupid that it hurts me, remember that shit? I don't
Fuck the rappers, fuck the business where the money yeah, fuck a bitch (gibberish)
House nigga, bitch I'm moving to a mouse nigga
Bring up hundreds in a hour burning crack nigga
No, no, we didn't do shit
Ain't no purgatory bitch, cot off operation, I could learn the drug bitch
Learn to flip a tire, fuck up all my outfits, oh shit
Culture vulture with a grip, I'm over this

[Outro]
Hmm that's- that just- that just- that's exactly what I said
But that's exactly what- that's exactly what I saidYou might also likeEmbed
