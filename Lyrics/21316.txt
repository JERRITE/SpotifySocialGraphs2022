White Trash Millionaire Lyrics[Intro]
I miss you so goddamn much, it aches
I try to be tough, but it just makes
The distance seem bigger
And meaner than yesterday
(Two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
I remember you were talking so loud
About how you can't wait to leave this town
We don't see eye-to-eye
On the better side of the bridge
[Verse 2]
You got me to pour my heart out
When I couldn't get myself off of the couch
I'm unpredictable
See how cool I look watching you

[Chorus]
So now I'm staying up and sleeping in
While wondering if we'll ever speak again
'Cause when I step outside and realize how many months it's been
Without you, I can't help but feel sad and empty all over again

[Bridge]
You say that nothing's wrong
I think it's all in my head
If love makes you rich
Then I would rather be broke instead

[Chorus]
So as the months get colder, I'm less sober
I'll see your face over and over
And as the nights get longer, I'll get stronger at least
I promise, um, I promâ€”I promise I'm gonna give it, uh, give it my best shot

[Instrumental Break]

So now I'm staying up and sleeping in
While wondering if we'll ever speak again
As the months get colder, I'm less sober
I'll see your face over and over
I'll see your face over and over

[Outro]
I'll see your faceEmbed
