Fire To the Fuse Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lied awake for days
Counting all the ways I died
Everything I couldn't save
Buried down, still half alive
It's got me crawlin' in my skin
But no one's coming now to hold me close
Pourin' out the gasoline
Yeah, I've been makin' friends with all these ghosts
And I've got nothing left to lose
[Pre-Chorus]
Fire to the fuse, yeah
Fire to the fuse

[Chorus]
I'm sick and it's twisted
But I'm back with a match, yeah, I'm a buzzkill
With nothing to lose
I'm sinking my teeth in
And I won't let you go, we're not having fun 'til
You set fire to the fuse

[Verse 2]
Well, it's not me to turn and run
Met the bitter truth and I choked it down
Left a bad taste on my tongue
But my appetite's been growing now
I can see you crawling in your skin
But no one's coming now to hold you close
I'm pouring out the gasoline
So say hello to all my ghosts

[Chorus]
I'm sick and it's twisted
But I'm back with a match, yeah, I'm a buzzkill
With nothing to lose
I'm sinking my teeth in
And I won't let you go, we're not having fun 'til
You set fire to the fuse
You might also like[Bridge]
All alone
I'm moving like your shadow
You're walking in my dead zone
Breathing slow, ooh
Love the hunt, love the high
Watching light fade from your eyes, ooh
And this is not a warning
This is not a test
I'm zeroed in on you and I'm
Comin' for the rest
And I'm about to ignite
Just try to play it cool
Echoes in your head like
Déjà, déjà vu

[Chorus]
I'm (I'm) sick and it's twisted
But I'm back with a match, yeah, I'm a buzzkill
With nothing to lose
I'm sinkin' my teeth in
And I won't let you go, we're not having fun 'til
You set fire to the fuse

[Outro]
I'm sick and it's twisted (I'm)
Fire to the fuse, fire to the fuse
Fire to the fuse, fire to the fuse
I'm sinkin' my teeth in
And I won't let you go, we're not having fun 'til
You set fire to the fuse3Embed
