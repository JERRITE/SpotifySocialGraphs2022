Satan Is Real Lyrics[Verse 1]
Martyrs
You cannot kill us all
Vengeance will come as a shock
Destroy us
But the paragon lives on
Among the wolves
We'll lead the pack

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There'll come a day, when all the cults demise
In this graveyard of desire
In due time you'll realize
[Chorus]
Satan is real, Satan is real
Core of all tyranny
Human catastrophe
Satan is real, Satan is real
Open your eyes and you'll see
Satan is real

[Verse 2]
Indulgence
This drug for the weak
You will never wipe the dreams from our minds
Reverence
Your lies are obsolete
Now come along
Let the one-eyed lead the blind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There'll come a day, a brand new sun
Brighter than the one that we have seen
Embracing him, the bringer of sin

[Chorus]
Satan is real, Satan is real
Curse of reality
Spiral of tragedy
Satan is real, Satan is real
Come crown the lord of the future
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Satan is real, Satan is real
Core of all tyranny
Human catastrophe
Satan is real, Satan is real
Open your eyes and you'll see

[Outro]
Satan is real, Satan is real
Curse of reality
Spiral of tragedy
Satan is real, Satan is real
Can you resist the temptation?
Satan is real!2Embed
