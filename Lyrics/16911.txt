Spread My Wings Lyrics[Verse 1: Steven Russell]
I've imagined faces of many lovers
To ease the pain of having no one in my life
And I'm tired of being undercover
It's time to navigate my feelings tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Steven Russell]
The sky is calm, the stars are bright
What's better than to be in flight
I'll relax my mind and be at ease
And let this journey set me free
Set me free
And I'll
[Chorus: Troop, Steven Russell]
Spread my wings (Oh) and fly away (Hey)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be (My heart will be) the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever more

[Verse 2: Steven Russell]
I often wondered how I managed
Always searching but not finding a true heart
What does it take to find me a lover
I'm hoping that I don't have to fly too far

[Pre-Chorus: Steven Russell]
The sky is calm, the stars are bright
And what's better than to be in flight
I'll relax my mind and be at ease
And let this journey set me free
Set me free

[Chorus: Troop, Steven Russell]
Spread my wings (Oh) and fly away (Away)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be (Oh) the pathway
(My heart is the way)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
(Oh)

Deep in thought, sleep that brought
Visions of mind-blowing decisions of a love I sought
I hope to find, I wrote the line to make you mine
I gotta wake up, I'm lost in time
Fascinated, infatuated, the industry ate it
The spark of love but seems dream-related
Make-believe, fantasy, a memory
Haunted me, I'm locked in reverie (Spread)
Thoughts been lost in the shadows of the darkness
We come worn and torn, I'm that podless
An empty vagrant soul, more like a hellhole
I tried to hold you tight but I fell slow (Heart)
Too weak to keep, too weak to speak, I'm looking for a guide
So the voice of God implied
The faith you hold, your dreams are gold so let it be told
Troop, sing

[Chorus: Troop, Steven Russell]
Spread my wings (Sing) and fly away
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be (My heart will be) the pathway (Oh)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
Spread my wings (Sing) and fly away
To a place that I long for
(Just you and me, baby)
And my heart will be (Oh) the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
Spread my wings and fly away (Hey)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
Spread my wings and fly away (Hey)
To a place that I long for
(Just you and me, baby)
And my heart will be (Oh, oh) the pathway (Oh)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more (Oh)
Spread my wings (I said oh)
And fly away (Oh)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be the pathway (Yeah)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
[Outro: Troop]
Spread my wings and fly away
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever moreEmbed
