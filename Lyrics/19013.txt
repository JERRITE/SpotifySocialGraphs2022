Curse the Gods Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Allah, Buddha, Jesus Christ
Whatever your god may be
Forget those idols let me tell you
They're tales of morbid brains

[Verse 2]
Everybody thinks he's right
That his gods are the only truth
Fanatic faith, fanatic deeds
Join my religion or die
[Pre-Chorus]
Jews killed Jesus, Christians slaughtered Jews
Millions die for their faith
Each religion prays that killing is a sin
How stupid logic can be

[Chorus]
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
Those fools have died for a lie

[Bridge]
Beware of those fools that keep telling you
God loves you, for you his son died
Fuck them, believe in yourself
Reality is God's just a lie

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
Those fools have died for a lie

[Outro]
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
Those fools have died for a lie
Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
Those fools have died for a lieEmbed
