Moon River Lyrics[Verse]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and meYou might also like15Embed
