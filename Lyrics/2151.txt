Watch Me Lyrics[Intro]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this

[Verse 1]
Can't find me up, up, and away
I give a fuck 'bout your wave
My nigga, I surf every day
Drownin' my soul in the basement, ayy
I ain't got much in the bank
I got a lot I could say
Caught up with goddesses, hey
I hope you forgive my mistakes
Yeah, run around with the renegades
You should take a seat, save your energy
I try to heal the gash with a band-aid
In the time of need, you call your enemies
I landed in Ibiza and I need a visa
I ain't playin' with you, this no Mamma Mia
Need a Hottie-tottie with a body, yeah
I just spit the knowledge then I'm out of here
[Refrain]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

[Verse 2]
I stumbled the cool
I'm awesome, kickflip in the Kostons
We should run for the pool
I got the fire flow, the department exhausted
I owe nothing to you
I'm in the Tahoe, man you making me nauseous
Pullin up with the crew
You such a hypebeast, man
You making me vomit, lookâ€”

[Chorus 2]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
It's always been more than the music
You riding waves in the back of my cruise ship
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it, my nigga, you foolish
You might also like[Refrain]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

[Verse 3]
Look, look, look
This shit is out of here
You got the heat I was not aware
BNBB out in Rotterdam
Got a new man, damn now I see him
He on the floor, in my colosseum
I hope to god he don't sign a prenup
See my ex on the street like I never seen her!

[Chorus 3]
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
You see me dancing like I'm Elvis
Just tell your man that it's all in the pelvis
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it, my nigga, you foolish
[Refrain]
(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down12Embed
