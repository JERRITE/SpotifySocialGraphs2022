Lost in My Bedroom Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're crystal clear
Facing the light
Don't disappear
It's just what I imagined
So happy here
Everything is right
It's crystal clear
Is this really over?

[Chorus]
I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head? Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It’s just what I imagined, I'm lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
[Verse 2]
Suddenly strange
Everything is right
Inside my brain
It's just what I imagined
Something's not right
Shadows appear
I close my eyes
Is this really over?

[Chorus]
I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head? Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It’s just what I imagined, I'm lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined

[Bridge]
It’s just what I imagined, I'm lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined

[Chorus]
I wake from my bed
Am I lost in my head? Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It’s just what I imagined, I'm lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imaginedYou might also like8Embed
