Superstars Lyrics[Letra de ''Superstars'']

[Intro: Kidd Keo]
Yeah
Bang
Yo', yeah
SHB
Yeah

[Estribillo]
Finally we coming off the dark (Off the dark)
The homie selling, trying to come off the block (Man, off the block)
I'm on my shit, my gang don't give a fuck (Ain't give no fuck)
All they know is fuck up parties, trap a lot (Trap a lot)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
[Verso 1]
Finally we coming off the hood (Gang)
I leave alone my mom and now she's living good (I love you, mom)
Since I was a kid I knew I was the one (Yes, the one)
I don't wanna see my homies selling none (Ain't no try)
I had a girl but she threw me to the trash (Buagh)
She met me on the block when I was chasing bands (Around, my man)
Me dejó roto el pecho y no la volví a ver (Gang)
Me lo arreglé gastando billete' de cien (I'll make it rain)
La vida es puta y yo la puse del revés (Turn it around)
No tengo tiempo pa' prestárselo a una ex (Let's fuck around)
I need the money, yo tengo cosas que hacer (Money)
My mom is poor and all my brothers in the trap (On the trap)
I'm chasing money with my people, fuck up commas with my fam (What?)
No te quieren si en verdad no le' importa verte caer (What?)
I gotta apologize my manners with who really fuck with me (I'm sorry)
Trying get it, harder do it when nobody loved me

[Estribillo]
Finally we coming off the dark (Off the dark)
The homie selling, trying to come off the block (Man, off the block)
I'm on my shit, my gang don't give a fuck (Ain't give no fuck)
All they know is fuck up parties, trap a lot (Trap a lot)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)
I got my people living like they're superstars (Like superstars)

I remember when I was tryna get it by my own (Own)
I was making all these clothes and with the homie selling dope (Designer)
I remember when I was by myself and by my own (Own)
I had a baby by my side who tryna teach me how to love (How to love)
I came from the bottom, puta, yo soy como soy (All my deal)
Sé de donde vengo, mami, sé pa' donde voy (Nyum!)
I'm from the block, I get the guap, I got no time to love, no thot (No)
Got my brothers selling coke, molly, trucks, to get the guap (Trap, trap, trap, trap)
Y'all be talkin' 'bout my people like you wanna have a problem (Prr)
Better don't fuck with the Keo while the Keo get the money
All my people had to trap, trying it turn it into something (Had to trap)
I turned out, bitch on my back, it's gonna kick ya all in troubles (Prr)
I smoke two blunts and now I'm passed out (God damn)
I got your girl, she makes that ass bounce (Bounce that ass)
I had to push it all the streets, to make it out
Gang shit and bad hoes and money, what my fame about (SHB)
