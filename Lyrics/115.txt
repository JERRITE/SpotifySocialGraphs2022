Finding My Way Lyrics[Intro]
I fall I rise at the end of the day
It's that real shit
I fall I rise (Nation)

[Chorus]
I can feel the best coming out me
I can pray for sun when it's lightning
I can be myself with a wifey
I can live my life on a low-key
I just run my check like a nike
Barely see myself 'cause I'm icy
I look in the mirror and what I see
I look in the mirror and what I see
(What you see woe)
Lost soul in the world had to find his way
I fall I rise at the end of the day
Black man with a plan understand it ain't safe
[Verse 1]
I don't know about you but I know about me I need piece in the midst of the madness
In a world so cold stay attached to your soul I suggest you invest in a jacket
I've been thinking 'bout life I've been praying every night when this real shit leak to the masses
They gon' feel me then they say he back again like I ain't drop me a shitload of classics
They gon' count me out I'm in a time machine, I'm doing work nigga sign a greet (Yeah, yeah)
I'm upper class in a mindfull league, I dug deep for a [?] feed, I'm so proud of me
Funny thing I ain't tryna be, I just gave the people honesty, you know what's up with me

[Chorus]
I can feel the best coming out me
I can pray for sun when it's lightning
I can be myself with a wifey
I can live my life on a low-key
I just run my check like a nike
Barely see myself 'cause I'm icy
I look in the mirror and what I see
I look in the mirror and what I see
(What you see woe)
Lost soul in the world had to find his way
I fall I rise at the end of the day
Black man with a plan understand it ain't safe

[Verse 2]
Big body all AMG I'm tryna shine every day of the week (skr)
Positivity is all I'm on but if you try a nigga we gon' see
Told my family this is bigger than us in due time baby we gon' eat
It's a lotta people falsifying instead of trying baby we gon' be
Long ways from the low life, I done switched up things I'm a man with a new wife
Been a placed in the bright light, still ride with a act right, leave a nigga, night night
Take a trip into my life, where the grass all green, can't believe that it's that nice
I'm on the gas in your windpipe, I've been really getting insight
You might also like[Chorus]
I can feel the best coming out me
I can pray for sun when it's lightning
I can be myself with a wifey
I can live my life on a low-key
I just run my check like a nike
Barely see myself 'cause I'm icy
I look in the mirror and what I see
I look in the mirror and what I see
(What you see woe)
Lost soul in the world had to find his way
I fall I rise at the end of the day
Black man with a plan understand it ain't safe

[Outro]
2020
Had to move through the fear had to move through the shame
