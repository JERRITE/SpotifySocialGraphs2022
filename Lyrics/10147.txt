TranslationsPortuguêsI’m to Blame Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Lightning fast at night
Hear the whispers in the rain
You don't want to die
You don't want to take that plane

[Pre-Chorus]
I broke you like a circus ride
Take that plane
I can see it in your eyes
You're screamin' out
You can't make me believe
I can't keep my focus
I don't want to unsee
Now you know
[Chorus]
I'm to blame (I showed you the light)
I'm to blame (I showed you the light)
I'm to blame (I showed you the light)
I'm to blame

[Verse 2]
Two birds on a wire
They don't know that they'll catch fire
We could find a way
Words of wisdom cause you pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I broke you like a circus ride
I caused you pain
I can see it in your eyеs
You're screaming out
You can't make mе believe
I can't keep my focus
I don't want to unsee
Now you know

[Chorus]
I'm to blame (I showed you the lie)
I'm to blame (I showed you the lie)
I'm to blame (I showed you the lie)
I'm to blame

No, I can't live a lie
You can't make me live a lie
Burning red, letting go
Up in flames, all the same
I am too

[Outro]
It sounds like madness (To you)
It sounds like madness (To you)
It sounds like madness (To you)
It sounds like madness
And I'm to blame4Embed
