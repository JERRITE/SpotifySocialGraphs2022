Message To The World LyricsAnother world collides, will we open the door
A message to the world it seems like
Everyone has a god standing up for what we think we know
Do we know?
We've got so far to go from here
And we've got so much to lose with American eyes, yeah
The curious hearts, we've got so much to learn
So we find, we find

When you kill me, do it slowly
When we've come undone
When you kill me, please do it slowly
Send a message to the world
(A message to the world)
Another war will rise, will we open the floor
Listen to the words it seems like
Every voice has a cause fighting for a world we think we own
But do we know?
We've got so far to go from here
We've got so much to lose with American eyes, yeah
And curious hearts, we've got so much to learn
So we find
(We find)

When you kill me, do it slowly
When we've come undone
When you kill me, please do it slowly
Send a message to the world
(A message to the world)

Send a message to the world
There's so much more to learn
There's so much more to live for
(So much more to live for)
More than we will ever know
It's a message to the world, yeah

When you kill me, do it slowly
When we've come undone
(It's a message to the world)
When you kill me, please do it slowly
Send a message to the world
(A message to the world)
