Finale (Show And Prove) [Japanese ver.] Lyrics[ビートゥービー「Finale (Show And Prove) [Japanese ver.]」歌詞]

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Make sure to pay close attention
Mouths closed, eyes and ears open
And most importantly; enjoy the show

[Verse 1]
Okay everybody's coming back to my world
暗闇を飲み込んだ太陽が
やがて僕を照らしてゆく
Okay everybody's coming back to my world
[Verse 2]
Make me feel so alone 今すぐ必要なモン
Healin ‘chillin’ like a villain 狂った flex with YOLO
激しい雨の中 絶頂へと駆け出した
青春の熱が今 この逆境 自分の道を行く
Kingdom 世界中で main villain
The Korean zombie is here
Hallyu, K-wave乗ったら死んでも死なない healer
そう 生まれつきずっと 注いで 闘争本能
音の力でひとつになれる
Let's focus on the show

[Chorus]
Let me show you
後悔なんてない show and prove
揺らす　この世界を
すべての心を一つに
今歌うメロディで
Show and prove 高く ほら
It's time to hit the road

[Verse 3]
We had a rough start but look at us now
Onе step at a time, all the way up
Wе're getting better. Give up? Never
Wanna judge? It don't matter
We keep going, we still growing, we stay hustling
I know ya'll know it
You gotta give us credit for that you know you can’t deny it (Whoa)
10 years and we still going strong (Oh yeah)
And we're still just getting warmed up (Right now)
If you overlook us
Then you’re gonna miss out
You'll for sure regret it later on (Uh)
This is for the haters (This is for the haters)
Get lost I'll see you later
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me show you
後悔なんてない show and prove
揺らす この世界を
すべての心を一つに
今歌うメロディで
Show And prove 高く ほら
It's time to hit the road

[Bridge]
一瞬だって無駄にならない 今日を歌おう
今が永遠になるよう 運命を歌おう
Tonight tonight tonight

[Chorus]
Let me show you
後悔なんてない show and prove
揺らす　この世界を
すべての心を一つに
今歌うメロディで
Show and Prove 高く ほら
It's time to hit the road

[Outro]
It's time to hit the road
It's time to hit the road
偶然のよう 運命のよう ただ永遠にEmbed
