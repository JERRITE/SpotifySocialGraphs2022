Why Don’t You Come On Lyrics[Verse 1: Khalid]
I'll be your light after midnight
We're brighter together
I'll be your eyes if you lose sight
We see better together
I'll be your silver lining
When your head is clouded
I'll be the only one you see
When the room is crowded

[Pre-Chorus: Empress Of]
Deep in your arms (Deep in your arms)
Where I belong (Where I belong)
I'm safe from harm (I'm safe from harm)
Keep holding on
[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on

[Verse 2: Khalid]
You got the world underneath your sleeve
And I got a heart that skips offbeat​
Love might be harder than it used to be
But you keep, keep holding on

[Pre-Chorus: Empress Of & Khalid]
Deep in your arms (Deep in your arms)
Where I belong (Where I belong)
I'm safe from harm (I'm safe from harm)
Keep holding on

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on

Keep holding on

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on

[Outro: Empress Of]
Why don't you come on
