RED SKY Lyrics[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
You left me in the cold

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Machine Gun Kelly]
I was waitin' to see what you said again
You bring me above  (You bring me above)
Straight mischief in my head again, oh (My head)
[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Sometimes, I realize I really need to get away
Some things I regret, I wish I could incinerate

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Life's full of lies, and then you damn die
I thought we were in sync, but I misread the signs
I was such a fool to think I could make you mine

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
You left me in the cold

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I was waitin' to see what you said again
You bring me above (Yeah, yeah)
Straight mischief in my head again, oh (Mischiеf in my head)

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Sometimes, I rеalize that I really need to get away
Some nights, my mind has thoughts that I wish I could incinerate
Life sells lies you should never buy
I got side effects they never advertise

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Machine Gun Kelly]
I was waitin' to see what you said again (What you said again)
You bring me above (You bring me above)
Straight mischief in my head again, oh (Mischief in my head, mischief in my head)
Oh, oh

Today, I saw a dotted line with your signature on the contract
Your soul is no longer mine, you saw Lucifer and made contact8Embed
