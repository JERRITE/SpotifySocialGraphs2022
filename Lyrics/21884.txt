That Kind of Beautiful Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have you ever been flying down a long windy road
With your windows wide open and the sun rushing in
Have you ever sat staring at a shoreline all night
Don't wanna blink your eyes thinking man - this is it
And the last thing you're thinking ‘bout is leaving
Yeah you can't believe you’re seeing what you’re seeing

[Chorus]
She's that kind of stop you right in your tracks
Knock you out, just like that
Something you just can't explain
That kind of blow your mind, every time
That you thought you'd never find
She's that kind - she's that kind of beautiful
[Verse 2]
It’s like that feeling that you get on a Sunday
It’s forgiveness when you need it the most
It’s like that little girl singing every single word
With a big smile, in the front row
Woman standing so close you can feel it
Yeah you're wishing that the whole world can see it

[Chorus]
She's that kind of stop you right in your tracks
Knock you out, just like that
Something you just can't explain
That kind of blow your mind, every time
That you thought you'd never find
She's that kind - she's that kind of beautiful

[Verse 3]
Once you've held, on (once you held on)
You won't remember where you've been
Just like that song (just like that song)
You wanna hear it again and again
She's that kind…

[Chorus]
She's that kind of stop you right in your tracks
Knock you out, just like that
Something you just can't explain
That kind of blow your mind, every time
That you thought you'd never find
She's that kind - she's that kind of…beautiful
Stop you right in your tracks
Knock you out, just like that
Something you just can't explain
That kind of blow your mind, every time
That you thought you'd never find
She's that kind - she's that kind of beautiful
