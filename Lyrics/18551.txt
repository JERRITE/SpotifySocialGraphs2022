Street Lightning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up the coveted car
Can't keep my eyes on the road
I wanna be where you are
And I don't wanna be alone
Strike anywhere on the match
Another mile to go
But if it ain't gonna last
Then baby I don't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
Breakdown, how could I regret
That even on the way down
I would take my chances on
[Chorus]
Slow dancing in your street lightning
Romancing what might've been
Like kerosene on my skin
Yeah, I can't let go, I can't let go
Of your street lightning
Swept under your thunder spin
My engine is caving in
And I can't let go, I can't lеt go

[Verse 2]
Too many bottles of wine
Can't get my ducks in a row
Who doеsn't wanna be high
When everybody's getting low?
Nicholson Room, On The Rox
Another memory to blow
But if the big hand on the clock is ticking
I could take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
Breakdown, how could I forget
That you're the best game in town
And I would take my chances on

[Chorus]
Slow dancing in your street lightning
Romancing what might've been
Like kerosene on my skin
Yeah, I can't let go, I can't let go
Of your street lightning
Swept under your thunder spin
My engine is caving in
And I can't let go, I can't let go
You might also like[Bridge]
I can't let go, I can't let go
I can't let go, I can't let go
(I can't let go, I can't let go)
Like I'm walking on water
Got my feet off the ground
(I can't let go, I can't let go)
Yeah, I run and I run and I can't stop now

[Chorus]
You're street lightning
Romancing what might have been
Like kerosene on my skin
And I can't let go, I can't let go
Of your street lightning
Swept under your thunder spin
I see you in everything
And I can't let go, I can't let go

[Outro]
And I can't let go, I can't let goEmbed
