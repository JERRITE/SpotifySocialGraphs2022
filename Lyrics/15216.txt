MUFFIN Lyrics[Intro: BadBoyHalo & CG5]
Oh my gosh, I love you
(Oh, woah)
(Nah, nah, nah, nah)

[Chorus: BadBoyHalo]
I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, when I wake up
I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, you know our love was
Ten times sweeter than candy
Ten times sweeter than cake
Thinkin', thinkin' about you
[Verse 1: BadBoyHalo with CG5]
Ding dong, trick or treat
I was knockin' at your door every week
And I saw you in my fortune cookie
What a great gift, like a basket of goodies
But you were cold as an ICEE
And I got a little bit of a brain freeze
I could speak your language (Language!)
If you just let me, let me in

[Verse 2: CG5]
I don't need a dating app
'Cause I got a Candy Crush on you
But you broke me, like a Kit Kat
Left my Heart Not Found rotting in the trash
Now, I'm scrolling and parolling through your Instagram feed
No, I'm not trolling, but you're all I wanna see
Insanity approaching, man, I'm drinkin' jealousy
Like a Coca Coly, oh-wee

[Pre-Chorus: BadBoyHalo]
I'm gonna keep the doctor away
'Cause you're my apple every day

[Chorus: BadBoyHalo, CG5 & Skeppy]
Every day I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, when I wake up
I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, you know our love was
Ten times sweeter than candy
Ten times sweeter than cake
Thinkin', thinkin' about you (He-heh, alright, alright)

She an angel, like a food cake
Got a halo and I'm lookin', like a double take
Stream with me, I'ma be your e-boy
We gon' mine diamonds, ayy, I know I'm a BadBoy
I've been looking in a jar full of jellybeans
Fly me to the Moon Pie up in Tennessee
Baby, I'll find you, yeah, we were meant to be
With a Ring Pop, I'll get down on one knee, marry me (Mwah)

[Verse 4: BadBoyHalo, CG5 & CaptainPuffy]
Willy Wonka, Willy Willy Wonka
I'ma be your chocolatier (Hypa)
Oompa loompa, doompity doo
You're the one I need, so have no fear (Ay-ya-ya-ya)
Can I call you mine? Be my valentine, the one of my dreams
Let me kiss you, like Hershey's (Woah-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: CG5 with BadBoyHalo]
I'm gonna keep the doctor away (Away, oh)
'Cause you're my apple every day (Every day)
And every day I'm thinkin' (Hey)
Every day I'm thinkin' (Oh-oh-oh)
Every day I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' about you (Language!)
[Chorus: BadBoyHalo & CG5]
I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, when I wake up (Woah-oh-oh)
I'm thinkin', thinkin' about you
Muffin, you know our love was
Ten times sweeter than candy (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Ten times sweeter than cake
Thinkin', thinkin' about you
(You bet I'm thinking about you!) (Hey, yeah, oh)

[Outro: CG5 with BadBoyHalo]

(Hey, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Your love was
Ten times sweeter than candy
Ten times sweeter than cake
Thinkin', thinkin' about you14Embed
