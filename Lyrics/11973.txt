Cooling Lyrics[Sample]
"Hey, honey! what's for breakfast this morning?"
"Nigga Please!"
"Hey! Can't you just tell me what's for breakfast?"
"Nigga Please!"

[Verse]
All of these hoes be triflin', so my dick can't getting hype
Laughing at bitches like "ha", shorty, you damn near a dyke
I'm a real picky ass nigga, hoe I ain't no 'Sremmurd
I got me some types
Gotta be ebony, love me correctly
And that pussy gotta be tight
She asked what we doin', I ask what she chewin'
If I take her out for a bite
She said she was going, grab that bitch a polly
She gon' be at it all night
Me and my niggas is eating, you hating
We obviously doing it right
I'm sounding like Ferb, take off with yo shit
Like Perry bitch I'm out of sight, aye
[Outro]
But I just be cooling for real, I just be cooling for real
I just be cooling for real, I just be cooling for real
I just be cooling for real, I just be cooling for real
I just be cooling for real, I just be cooling for real, ayeYou might also like3Embed
