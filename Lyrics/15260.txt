Listen To DJâ€™s LyricsYou have to listen to DJ's from the old age(days)
No matter where you're from this music's gonna play
Might be on your soundcrash on every Friday
You got echo minot, no lazy bodies
So listen what your DJ plays
It's major worries, and his little rosie
Admiral Bailey and his big Belly
King Kong sings a song called Trouble Again
Josie wales says no wrong free call me
Wayne Smith, Peter Metro, and Charlie Chaplain
Early be, Coca Tea, Brigadier Jerry, Tiger, Papa Son, and mister Wilton Ire
Mad Cobra sings flex it's time to have sex
Tristian palma and entertainment
Seen yellow man's maze, on blueberry hilL
Mega bonton and some bouyaa for you
You have to listen to DJ's from all the old age
No matter where you're from this music's gonna play

Might be on your radio on every Sunday
So listen what your DJ plays. (2x)
You-ROY will be gone by the end of the day
Michigan & Smiley in a different stylee
General Trees ...... 50 dollar bills
Buru Banton you know he's got skillz
Tenor Saw ,General Echo, and Papa (?)
Cutty Ranks, Jah Thomas he's the virgin
Cutty Ranks,Buju Banton
Super Cat
Tippa Ire allright
Sizzla

You've got to listen to DJ's from across the globe
Big up to Half Pint
So listen what your DJ plays (2x)
Because this kind of music it'll never get old
Might be on your radio every Sunday
