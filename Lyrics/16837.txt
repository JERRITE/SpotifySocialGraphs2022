Never Felt This Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
There will never come a day
You'll ever hear me say that I want
And need to be without you
I wanna give my all
Baby just hold me
Simply control me
'Cause your arms, they keep away the lonelies

[Pre-Chorus]
When I look into your eyes, then I realize
That all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life, 'cause I
[Chorus]
Never felt this way about loving
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good

[Verse 2]
How it takes my breath, starts a pounding in my chest
Makes me weak when I think about you
Makes me wanna give my all
Life wouldn't mean a thing
Not a heavy song to sing
Just emptiness if I dare to live without you

[Pre-Chorus]
When I look into your eyes, then I realize that
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause I Never felt this way about loving
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about loving it feels so good
'Cause I never felt this way about loving darling
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about loving it feels so good
Never felt this way about loving
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about loving it feels so goodYou might also likeEmbed
