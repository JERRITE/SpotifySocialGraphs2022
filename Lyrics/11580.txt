Fit N Full Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the bowery singin’ "Country Roads"
I was outta town when Dymphnas closed
Got prettier in Denver
Phasing out of this old fairy tale
Apple cider vinegar and kale
I'm fit and full as ever

[Chorus]
If you want, I can take it off
And show you what my mama gave me
[Verse 2]
Only getting hotter as I sweat
I have never really been upset
Just hollow and amazing
All I want is to be like my dad
All I want's to give you what I have
I'm generous and vacant

[Chorus]
If you want, I can take it off
And show you what my mama gave me
It's so hot
In this restaurant
I might just get fully naked

[Bridge]
If you want, I can take it off
Show you what my mama gave me
(The cleaning thing, the tidal creek)
(The murderous bird, her bleeding beak)
(The cleaning thing, the tidal creek)

[Chorus]
It's so hot in this restaurant (The murderous bird, her bleeding beak)
I might just get fully nakedYou might also like2Embed
