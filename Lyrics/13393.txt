TranslationsPortuguêsHELLGIRL Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me in your world
Pretty tears you hold

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me all mesmerized
I need to know you're mine

[Chorus]
I could be your hell girl, baby
Just wanna hear you say you're proud of me
All the other angels hate me falling from you
[Verse 2]
Haunt me, you know I've been hearin' you callin'
I know the devil, he wants me, breathe me in (Ha-ah)
Haunt me, you know that heaven has lost me
I think I feel myself fallin' into sin (Ha-ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me all mesmerized
I need to know you're mine

[Chorus]
I could be your hell girl, baby
Just wanna hear you say you're proud of me
All the other angels hate me falling from you

[Bridge]
I'll worship your lies
Sadistic design
Our false paradise

[Outro]
I could be your—
I could be your—
I could be your—
I could be your hell girl
I could be your—
I could be your—
I could be your—
I could be your—You might also likeEmbed
