Candy Rain (Heavy D & Trackmasterz Mix) Lyrics[Chorus: Soul For Real]
My love
Do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

[Verse 1: Jason]
Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way
Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you (...you, you)
'Cause you are
[Chorus: Soul For Real, Jason]
My love (My love)
Do you ever dream of (Do you ever dream?)
Candy coated raindrops? (Oh, oh, darlin')
You're the same, my candy rain

[Verse 2: Jason]
My love, did you ever dream
That it could be so right?
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want, all I need now, I know
I know I found it in you, I found it in you
(I found it in you)
'Cause you are

[Chorus: Soul For Real, Jason, Heavy D]
My love (My love)
Do you ever dream of (Do you ever dream?)
Candy coated raindrops? (Oh, oh, oh)
You're the same, my candy rain
This is how we do and you don't stop
I said this it's done and you don't stop

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Tic-tac-toe and, three in a row and
Sit back, relax and listen to a pro and
As I start goin', blowin', flowin', showin' and mowin' MC's
That I'm the capital H-E-A-V-Y Decent
This is my yard, or better yet my precinct
No discontent because I'm all about pleasin'
Ha ha ha, you like my style, I'm buckwild
I'm bananas, I'm out of hand, extravaganza, both are grand
So can you dig it, man?
You might also like[Chorus: Soul For Real, Jason]
My love
Do you ever dream of (Do you ever dream)
Candy coated raindrops? (Oh, oh, oh)
You're the same, my candy rain
(You're the same, my candy rain)
