Hurricane Lyrics[Intro]
Fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water

[Verse 1]
Today, we're gonna fade away
The harder to say
The better the way
But they can't beat your count
This is not a lie
You'll glow in the light
You don't ever need to run
[Chorus]
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
We might just fade away, we don't care what they say
Everything will go, will go in place
And if you fear the pain, there's no one else to blame
So are you ready now to play the game?
Gotta make, gotta make, gotta make more
And nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows what's right in front of you
Follow me, follow me, follow me home
Nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows it's right in front of you

[Chorus]
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
In the end, we'll rise and we're gettin' up from the water
