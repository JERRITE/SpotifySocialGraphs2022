For Those Who Wait LyricsThis is for those who wait

Another day, another waiting game
A little different but itâ€™s still the same
I am here but where's the One I'm longing for?
I'm having troubles feeling all alone
When will my heart ever find a home?
I want to hope but sometimes I just don't know
I know I'm not the only one

So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set your heart on fire
Let it set you free
When you're fighting to believe
In a love that you can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait
I want to open up my eyes
I know that all I need is time
I'm growing stronger every single day
God, I'm gonna lead them to You now
Letting go all of my fear and doubt
I can't do this on my own so I'll give You control
I know I'm not the only one

So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set your heart on fire
Let it set you free
When you're fighting to believe
In a love that you can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait

The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
And the difference makes it worth it

So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set your heart on fire
Let it set you free
When you're fighting to believe
In a love that you can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait
