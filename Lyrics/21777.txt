Hot Cookinâ€™ LyricsWon't you let the heat out of the oven
Lord it takes a while to build a fire
Don't let 'em cool you down, don't let 'em cool you down

Cause it's some hot cookin' that's going on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
Think I might

Cause if you put the fuel into the fire
And you start a chain reaction
Which is burning me, toss and turning me through the night
The temperature is rising fast
The feeling's strong, I can't mask
It's two for you to melt into desire
Cause it's some hot cookin' that's going on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
Think I might

My mama always said don't play with fire
Goin' to up and burn this whole house down
But I'm about to start this match and paper on fire
So you ???? on the ground

My fevers pitching and I'm not so sure
What I'm talking 'bout
I put my foot into my mouth
I don't know what I'm saying
Now is not the time for words
Forget all those things you heard
It's time for you to melt into the fire

Cause it's some hot cookin' that's going on tonight
And the temperature is rising just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burning bright
I think I might, yes I think I might
Yes I think I might
Ooo I think I mightYou might also likeEmbed
