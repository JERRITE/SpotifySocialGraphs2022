Day Or Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Call up your body
And call your name
Oh, breathing the fire to feel the same

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake and by your side
I'm in your blood and you're in mine
I've lost all my sense of time
Don't care if its day or night
Day or night
[Instrumental]

[Pre-Drop]
Put your hands up
Put your, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Day or night

[Drop]
Day or night


[Verse 2]
Call up your body
And call your name
Oh, breathing the fire to feel the same

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake and by your side
I'm in your blood and you're in mine
I've lost all my sense of time
Don't care if its day or night
Day or night

Put your hands up

Put your hands up
