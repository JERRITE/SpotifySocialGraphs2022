Ruthless Cupid Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wanna leave but I gotta go home
Where'd you come from, where did you go?
I don't recall ever feeling so low
Washed up and burned out, thirty years old
I'm holding out for a little romance
But nobody's ever said "shut up and dance"
Like the way that you did babe
Yeah, you made me feel something

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey come back, you never told me your name
What kind of game have you got me in?
Whatever it is, I'd let you win
Oh, now I see you with some other guy
Who's fucked up and pissed off, looking to fight
I never said what I wanted to say
Oh, nobody's ever stood me up this way
Just when I thought I was finally sane
Then changed my world, then took it away
[Chorus]
Oh, honey come back, you never told me your name
I should've known it would always end up this way
Oh, Cupid, I'm stupid for listening
You're ruthless with this goose chasing over me

[Verse 3]
It's time to leave, I can't wait to get home
Struggle to swim down the river I've sold
I can't pretend, darling, you hit a nerve
I jumped in too soon, I got what I deserved

[Chorus]
Oh, honey come back, you never told me your name
I should've known it would always end up this way
Oh, Cupid, I'm stupid for listening
You're ruthless with this goose chasing over me

[Outro]
Oh, Cupid you're ruthless
Oh, Cupid, I'm just stupid
But Cupid, this goose chase ain't over yetYou might also likeEmbed
