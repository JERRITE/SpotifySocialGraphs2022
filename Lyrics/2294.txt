Be My Ocean LyricsI'm in love with you, yes
I feel it
Will you be the one to catch these feelings
With you on this bed the air is something
It took my breath away

You're my hopeless devotion
Dealing oh with you, I do with caution
Because I don't want the two of us to be broken
So just take me
Be my ocean
What is the commotion?
I just wanna dive in the river
To be with the one I love
And if I tried to hurt you
Still I'd belong to you
Dive in the river
To be with
To be with the
Be with the one I love

Am I dead already?
Abandon ship, these waves they tip me over
And I'm just about to sink
But if you're ever down and out
And if there ever is a doubt
Then you call me

Be my ocean
What is the commotion?
I just wanna dive in the river
To be with the one I love
And if I tried to hurt you
Still I'd belong to you
Dive in the river
To be with the one I love
You might also likeLet it be
Just you and me
Now if I could drown in you
Baby please
I need your release
Now if I could drown in youEmbed
