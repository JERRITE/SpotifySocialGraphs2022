Listen, uh, the wrong key I pressed is like you (Like you)
The mood of the changed song is now a grayish monotony
Your eyes, your breath, an excited hand gesture, right now, right now
Twist, twist, twist, it makes me drunk
Deep, deep, deep, it's driving both of us crazy
I can't tell anyone about you
You interrupted my life all of a sudden (Oh, oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I need you, you
You, the one who ruined my life, you
I don't I, I don't I
I don't I, blame you
[Chorus]
Faded in my last song, faded in my last song
I promise you eternity, I promise you eternity
You can trick me with lies
My last song for you that I cannot hide
Faded in my last song, faded in my last song
Don't know what I'm saying, don't know what I'm saying
I have to let you go from my memory
My last season called 'you', my last song

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know, I'm trying to understand
We can't, we can't, we can't, it's a definite ending
Yeah, a tragic ending, an unsettled note
This is a silent scream, yeah
Do you wanna play? Do you wanna play? Wow
An intense trembling, it's crazy
A last note, baby
Ice on with no lights on but you're still shining, yeah
I can't be in touch with you, bye, bye, bye

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I need you, you
You, the one who ruined my life, you
I don't I, I don't I
I don't I, blame you
You might also like[Chorus]
Faded in my last song, faded in my last song
I promise you eternity, I promise you eternity
You can trick me with lies
My last song for you that I cannot hide

[Bridge]
You won't be here after the song is over
I lose the way I lose sense, I lose the light of you, ya
You in my sheet music, I can't erase you
Broken tales of the two of us
In my ears, broken tales of the two of us
I'm dizzy, it's more painful
Wanna go back, I reach out to you like this again
Come by my side, come by my, come by my side

[Chorus]
Faded in my last song, faded in my last song
I promise you eternity, I promise you eternity
You can trick me with lies
My last song for you that I cannot hide
Faded in my last song, faded in my last song (Faded in my song)
Don't know what I'm saying, don't know what I'm saying
I have to let you go from my memory
My last season called 'you', my last song
[Outro]
Faded in my song
I don't know what I'm saying
Oh woah, oh woah, faded, faded, faded, faded1Embed
