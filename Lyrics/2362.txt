Hard to Say Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know why I give into you
This hurts too much
Every part of me just wants to run
But I can’t, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll stay right here
Just for one more night
I tell myself I'm fine here with you
Just for one more night
You make it hard to say goodbye
[Chorus]
You make it hard to say goodbye
And I don’t wanna say goodbye
You make it hard to say goodbye, yeah yeah
I tell myself I'm fine here with you
Just for one more night
You make it hard to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
So let's give into what we know this is
You hold me back, yeah
And I hate when I know that I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop that, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll stay right here
Just for one more night
I tell myself I'm fine here with you
Just for one more night
You make it hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
You make it hard to say goodbye
And I don't wanna say goodbye
You make it hard to say goodbye, yeah yeah
I tell myself I’m fine here with you
Just for one more night
You make it hard to say goodbye

You make it hard to say goodbye
And I don’t wanna say goodbye
You make it hard to say goodbye1Embed
