Your winter - acoustic LyricsThe grey ceiling on the earth
Well it's lasted for a while
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
I've been acting like a child
In your opinion, what is that?
It's just a different point of view, oh yeah

What else, what else can I do?
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry, oh oh
I said I'm sorry, but what for?
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself
Don't want to hurt you
Why do you chew your pain if you only knew
How much I love you love you
Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven, oh yeah
And I will be here, yeah

Old picture on the shelf
It's been there for a while
A frozen image of ourselves
We were acting like a child

Innocent and in a trance
A dance that lasted for a while oh
You read my eyes just like a diary

Oh remember, please remember oh oh
Well I'm not a beggar, but what's more
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself, dont want to hurt you
Why do you chew that pain if only you knew
How much I love you, no

Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here oh

And I will be here

Well I won't be your winter (I won't)
And i won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And We can be forgiven (oh I know)
And I will be hereEmbed
