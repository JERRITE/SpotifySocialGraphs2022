Just Like That Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good morning, eyes open
I can see the light shining through
Good morning, blinds open
I’m coming home to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Soft with the weather
Cool with the breeze
Flip through the pages of reality
Float like a feather out to the sea
Roam like a lion living wild and free
[Chorus]
Just like that snap my fingers
Just like that dreams get bigger
Just like that paint a picture
Just like that (just like that)
Just like (just like)
Cause what you want
You’ll have it just like

[Drop]
Just like that, just like that, just like that, just like
Anything you want you can have it
Whatever you need you can grab it
Just like that
Anything you want you can have it
Whatever you need, what you need

[Verse 2]
Good evening, eyes closing
We can see the star shining through
Good evening, blinds closing
It’s just me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
Soft with the weather
Cool with the breeze
Flip through the pages of reality
Float like a feather out to the sea
Roam like a lion living wild and free
You might also like[Chorus]
Just like that snap my fingers
Just like that dreams get bigger
Just like that paint a picture
Just like that (just like that)
Just like (just like)
Cause what you want
You’ll have it just like

[Drop]
Just like that, just like that, just like that, just like
Anything you want you can have it
Whatever you need you can grab it
Just like that
Anything you want you can have it
Whatever you need, what you need1Embed
