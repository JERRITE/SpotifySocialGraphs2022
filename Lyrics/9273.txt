Itâ€™s Not Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stuck in a doorway
Don't know where you are
If they had it your way
Shooting stars

Stuck in a doorway
Don't know where you are
If they had it your way
Shooting stars
[Chorus]
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love

[Verse 2]
Stuck in a doorway
Don't know who you are
If they had it your way
Shooting stars

Stuck in a doorway
Don't know who you are
If they had it your way
Shooting stars

[Chorus]
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not love
It sinks into your head; hell, it hurts but it's not loveYou might also like3Embed
