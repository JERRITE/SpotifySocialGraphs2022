So Long, Astoria Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was the first snow of the season, I can almost see you breathing
In the middle of that empty street
Sometimes I still see myself in that lonesome bedroom
Playing my guitar and singing songs of hope for a better future

[Chorus]
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains
[Verse 2]
Last night while everyone was sleeping, I drove through my old neighborhood
And resurrected memories from ashes
We said that we would never fit in when we were really just like them
Does rebellion ever make a difference?

[Chorus]
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains

[Bridge]
So long, Astoria, I found a map to buried treasure
And even if we come home empty handed
We'll still have our stories of battle scars
Pirate ships and wounded hearts
Broken bones and all the best of friendships
And when this hourglass has filtered out its final grain of sand
I raise my glass to the memories we had

[Outro]
This is my wish and I'm taking it back
I'm taking them all backYou might also likeEmbed
