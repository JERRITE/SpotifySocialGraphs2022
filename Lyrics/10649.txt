I Like What I Like Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, this that Hellberg shit

[Chorus]
I like what I like
Bad little biddy that's talking all reckless
I like what I like
Lil' daddy came through and he taught me a lesson
I like what I like
I need me a telly with suites like the Westin
I like what I like
He chargin' a fee and he getting the backend
[Verse 1]
I like a nigga that swiping them Visas
Steady be swiping them pieces
I like a nigga that's dodging them cases
Now I'ma sit on his face, sis
I like a nigga that stuck in the bando
Run down the opps like he Rambo
I like a shooter that steady
Be trigger happy in the Camry
Now he gon' shoot at niggas like they Bambi
Now he gon' shoot at niggas 'cause we family
All in his feelings 'cause niggas be feeling me
Up in the foreign, the stars where the ceilings be
Ballin' so hard, they be taxin' me
Coming so hard 'cause I'm packing heat
Got all the real niggas jacking me
'Cause Malii' on go, get a bag a week

[Chorus]
I like what I like
Bad little biddy that's talking all reckless
I like what I like
Lil' daddy came through and he taught me a lesson
I like what I like
I need me a telly with suites like the Westin
I like what I like
He chargin' a fee and he getting the backend
I like what I like
Bad little biddy that's talking all reckless
I like what I like
Lil' daddy came through and he taught me a lesson
I like what I like
I need me a telly with suites like the Westin
I like what I like
He chargin' a fee and he getting the backend
You might also like[Verse 2]
I like a nigga that's choppin' them bricks down
Now he gon' tell 'em its real estate
I like a nigga that take me on dinner dates
Do a hunnid on the interstate
I like a nigga that changin' the view
Now we out charging the room
Popping the shit when we pull up in coupes
Call him "Big Poppa", he gimme the loot
Call him "Big Daddy" 'cause he with a baddie
Whippin' the foreign, he grabbing my fatty
All of his exes, they steady be aggy
All of his exes they steady be maddy
All in a row they be nothin' but bums
Herbs, dubs, nothing but scrubs
All in my face 'cause they all on his case
All on his body, I'm winning this race

[Chorus]
I like what I like
Bad little biddy that's talking all reckless
I like what I like
Lil' daddy came through and he taught me a lesson
I like what I like
I need me a telly with suites like the Westin
I like what I like
He chargin' a fee and he getting the backend
I like what I like
Bad little biddy that's talking all reckless
I like what I like
Lil' daddy came through and he taught me a lesson
I like what I like
I need me a telly with suites like the Westin
I like what I like
He chargin' a fee and he getting the backendEmbed
