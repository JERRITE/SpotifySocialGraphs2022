One Job Lyrics[Hook]
Dry your eyes, the fuck you crying for?
Where's your spine? You ain't got that no more?
The dick is fire, that's what I signed up for
But after all this time you're so damn insecure

[Chorus]
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job, the fuck?
You only, you only, you only had one
[Verse 1]
Real niggas a myth, they on a decline
Real niggas extinct, real niggas a lie
Nigga I thought saw your worth
That shit got declined

[Pre-Hook]
I hit low cause you hit lower
Turned into someone
Then lost control
Because my pum tun up
Think I'm cold when I cut you off
You get emotional

[Hook]
Dry your eyes, the fuck you crying for?
Where's your spine? You ain't got that no more?
The dick is fire, that's what I signed up for
But after all this time you're so damn insecure

[Chorus]
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job, the fuck?
You only, you only, you only had one

Real niggas a myth they on a decline
Fraud niggas exist, 3 outta 5
I show these niggas no love oh
All of the time

[Pre-Hook]
I hit low cause you hit lower
Turned into someone
Then lost control
Because my pum tun up
Think I'm cold when I cut you off
You get emotional

[Hook]
Dry your eyes, the fuck you crying for?
Where's your spine? You ain't got that no more?
The dick is fire, that's what I signed up for
But after all this time you're so damn insecure

[Chorus]
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job, the fuck?
You only, you only, you only had one
[Bridge]
I'm petty when you offend my loyalty
I know you really want me to believe you now
Quit acting like a bitch, you in your feelings
No, no, no, no bullshit babe

[Hook]
Dry your eyes, the fuck you crying for?
Where's your spine? You ain't got that no more?
The dick is fire, that's what I signed up for
But after all this time you're so damn insecure

[Chorus]
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job nigga, the fuck?
You only had one job, the fuck?
You only, you only, you only had one2Embed
