If I Had You Lyrics[Verse 1]
So I got my boots on, got the right amount of leather
And I'm doin' me up with a black color liner
And I'm working my strut, but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line 'tween the dark side
And the light side, baby, tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble, tryna find it
[Chorus]
But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
You, you, you
If I had you

[Verse 2]
From New York to LA, getting high, rock and rollin'
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rollin' in Maserati's
What they need in this world is some love

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line 'tween the wild time
And a flat-line, baby, tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble, tryna find it

[Chorus]
But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you (You), you (You), you, you
If I had...
You might also like[Bridge]
The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I've got you stuck on my mind, yeah
The fashion and the stage
It might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

[Chorus]
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy, yeah
If I had you, you, you
If I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need, yeah
If I had you
Then money, fame and fortune never could compete
(Never could compete with you) If I had you
Life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy (It'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah, if I had you, you, you, you
If I had you15Embed
