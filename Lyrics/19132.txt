It’s Going Down* LyricsLyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
I was at the bottom of the barrel, now I'm at the top (Let's go)
I cannot stop (Can't stop)
I saw my opps (My opps)
I grab the mob (The mob)
Meet me at the trap (Yeah)
But I am no Yung Joc, but it's going down
It's going down
It's going down
It's going down
I was on the drugs all night
I was on the drugs all night
I was on caution zones
Now my pockets doin' alright
[Verse 1]
I had to go get the guap
I had to go get the bands
I had to go get the money
Ran as fast as I can
Spent 200 on an Audi
Spent 200 on a Lamb
Peanut butter all on my seats
Got a Glock so I can’t get jammed
SRT on your Jeep
You need to get it fast
I pulled up in a URUS
Your bitch couldn’t give a damn
She said “Uzi I’m yours”You might also like3Embed
