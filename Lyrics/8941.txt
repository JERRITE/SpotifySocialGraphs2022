You Need Loving LyricsYou've got yearnin'
And I got burnin'
Baby, you look so sweet and cunnin'
Baby, way down inside
Woman, you need love
Woman, you need love

You've got to have some love
I'm gonna give you some love
I know you need love
You just gotta have love
You make me feel so good
You make me feel alright
You're so nice
You're so nice
You're frettin'
And I'm pettin'
A lot of good things
You ain't gettin'
Baby, way down inside
You need love

You need to be hugged
And squeezed real tight
The light of the moon
On some summer night
You need love
And kissing too
All these things
Are good for you

I ain't foolin'
You need schoolin'
Baby, you know you need coolin'
Baby, way down inside
Woman, you need loveYou might also likeEmbed
