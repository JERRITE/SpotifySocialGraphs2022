Panic Attacks in Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]
Typical of me to go and ruin the party
Everybody says they love me but I'm still broken hearted
They call me Polly Pessimism, I'm a macabre Barbie
(I love you)

[Pre-Chorus]
My boyfriend wants to love me but I won't let him
I've been predisposed to trauma since I was eleven
So I wrote a couple albums to let out some aggression
I hate that I'm so
Self-deprecating
More comfortable in bad situations
Sucker for a little devastation
And this always happens
[Chorus]
Panic attacks in paradise
Piña coladas, I'm terrified
I swear I'm not crying, the sun's just bright
I'm having the best time of my life
Panic attacks in paradise
Hyperventilating under candy skies
Telling myself that this is fine
I'm having the best time of my life

[Verse 2]
It's a big joke
Ha ha, I love laughin'
It's a big hoax
You're self-help happy
'Cause I'm okay
I'm pure propane
On an open flame (Watch me blow up)

[Pre-Chorus]
My boyfriend wants to love me but I won't let him
I've been predisposed to trauma since I was eleven
So I wrote a couple albums to let out some aggression
I hate that I'm so
Self-deprecating
More comfortable in bad situations
Sucker for a little devastation
And this always happens
