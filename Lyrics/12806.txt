Out of Style Lyrics[Intro]
We cannot change the past
But we can start today to make a better tomorrow
Hit it
DJ Lethal
Fresh
Fresh
Chiggity-check, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
I've been askin' for somethin' (Askin' for somethin')
While I'm askin' for nothin' (Askin' for nothin')
[Pre-Chorus]
When's it gonna change?
Hurts me in a loving kinda way
I'ma celebrate, yeah

[Chorus]
It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (Style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a soundcheck, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah
Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
Check, three, four, Bizkit out there on the bounty
In the war zone, got these campers all around me

[Post-Chorus]
We should be on the same team (Same team)
On the motherfuckin' same team (Same team)
If we ain't, then we nothing, nothing (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Damn, got serious for a second
I would say delirious, for the record
Lookin' back as a skeptic
Why is there a cross hangin' from my necklace?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When's it gonna change?
Hurts me in a, in a loving kinda way
I'ma celebrate, yeah

[Chorus]
It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (Style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a soundcheck, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah
Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
Check, three, four, Bizkit out there on the bounty
In the war zone, got these campers all around me

[Post-Chorus]
We should be on the same team (Same team)
On the motherfuckin' same team (Same team)
If we ain't, then we nothing, nothing
We should be on the same team (Same team)
On the motherfuckin' same team (Same team)
If we ain't, then we nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (Style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a soundcheck, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah
Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
Check, three, four, Bizkit out there on the bounty
In the war zone, got these campers all around me (Fresh)1Embed
