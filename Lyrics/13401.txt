A Big Tree In a Great Green Field Lyrics[Verse]
Part-time picnic partners
A big tree in a big green field we could meet
Runaway from our problems
Because hide and seek is just what we need
We won't actually solve them
But we feel complete under the big tree
Under the big tree in a great green fieldYou might also likeEmbed
