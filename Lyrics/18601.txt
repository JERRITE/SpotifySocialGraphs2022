Never Be What You Want LyricsI remember the nights we spent under city lights
This feelingâ€™s got the best of me
We were floating along to the sounds of a dead end town
But now that's just a memory
I can't figure you out, you've got more fight in you
Than anybody else
And here's the part where I started to make my own damn decisions
And make a name for myself

[Chorus]
I'll never be what you want
I wouldn't change any part of me
Just to make you stay
You had a piece of my heart
But not enough to just run away
Cause I know what's best for me
Take all your big plans and throw them away
I've got something in mind before we go separate ways
We ask the questions, baby
Who provides the answers?
I'm scared to death and it shows
The flame burned out, but it glows
And the look in your eyes says things I don't want to know
It's time to go
Come closer
And I can't say anything, everything comes out the wrong way

[Chorus]

Just try, just try a little harder
I'll do my best explaining all the things I'm going through
Just try, just try a little harder
This is why I can't adjust for you

You can't stay
The look in your eyes says things I don't wanna know
No you, you can't stay

I wanna be with you
And no one else
I need you to feel the way that you felt
That summer night
When you found that puzzle piece
Missing for eight straight weeks
You're not the perfect fit
