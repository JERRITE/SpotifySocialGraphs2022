Hacked My Instagram (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

[Chorus: Pi'erre Bourne]
I got her legs shakin', yeah
In the air, hey
Said she feel like she on a elevator (Woah, woah, woah)
Hey, baby, I'm going up like a escalator (Yeah, I'm going up)
Ayy, I'ma fuck your friend, she's an instigator (She really wanna fuck)
She know I'm getting paper, wait, wait
Remember them nights in my Escalade? (It was cold as fuck)
Hey, now I'm waking up, bitch, I'm getting paid (I got my paper up)
Yeah, PayPal me then it's straight to Chase (Yeah)
