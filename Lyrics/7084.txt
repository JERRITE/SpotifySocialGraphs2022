​​love me or i’ll improvise LyricsI was playing save a hoe
Goddess, you can’t take it though
You sensing I’m sensational
Feed me, I’m insatiable

Early morning paradise
Love me or I’ll improvise
So fly that I terrify
Terrify

Keep it real so I just hit different
And you feel that baby don’t you
There’s nothing you won’t do
Lucky for you I want you yeah
You gotta trust me baby
Don’t let no opinion phase you
They ain’t you
They can’t relate to you

I was playing save a hoe
Goddess, you can’t take it though
You sensing I’m sensational
Feed me, I’m insatiable

Early morning paradise
Love me or I’ll improvise
So fly that I terrify
Terrify

Pulled up on me, gave me reiki, made me forget all about ‘em
Kissed me on some random shit spontaneous yeah you about it
You next level I’m next level so let’s take it to next level

Keep it real so I just hit different
And you feel that baby don’t you
There’s nothing you won’t do
Lucky for you I want you yeahYou might also likeEmbed
