First It Giveth Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm in you, now you're in me
I can't tell
You're so cruel, more than me
It is true (That's right)
Loyal to only you, up your sleeve
I want some (Come on, take it)
Of all of you (It's yours)
Trickin' me

[Chorus]
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
[Bridge]
I would beg and I would plead
I would shake

[Verse 2]
On a hook, dangling
Wide awake
I'm so young and beautiful (That's right, I'm slick)
I'm no fool
Time goes by, tables turn
All I know

[Chorus]
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away

[Outro]
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
First, it giveth, then it taketh away
Away, awayYou might also like4Embed
