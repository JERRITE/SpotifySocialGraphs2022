Order/disorder LyricsDo you want disorder?
Well I don't believe you
I've heard you order yourself around "Do this, do that."
Why? Why?
To left and right

Order disorder
Well I'll leave you
To arrange your disarray anyway you see fit
It's criminal how you abide
That's not the order
In which we do things
You want the credit and the award
Before lifting a finger
Even though, do you even know what the word "try" means?

Do you want to turn this world round
You might stop spinning first

Am I to control myself now
But maybe I cannot

I'm gonna control myself now
Will be your famous last words

A fixed form of broken
Will wreck or mend you
Calculate your short change
Just the same, just the same

Critique, criminal
Let's critique it all

Do I wanna control it all now
Well maybe we cannot
You might also likeI want to control myself now
Will be my famous last words

This is not going awayEmbed
