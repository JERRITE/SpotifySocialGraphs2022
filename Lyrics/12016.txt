HIMMYimmy LyricsAyo I know this bitch hard

Chanel gowns
Yellow bone naked now
She the best in town
4 door foreign look best in brown

5 blade fill our nose
Like a bitch get wet like hoes
Ain't no envy in me
And I empty clip on the enemy
This a Hellcat you hear me HEMI?
HIMMYimmy
All she wanted
Birkin bag
Birkenstocks
Red bottom flamin' hots
She like gimmie gimmie
She like gimmie gimmie
Call her honey poo
Eat the D like honey do you hear me
And I'm walkin round with an awful lotta loot
Think he finna follow who
Any foolery I shoot
I get neck like a tie
And he finna follow suit
Molten(?) hot like lemon soup
I get mouth like a scoup
I get mouth cordon bleu
Lauren Ralph polo blue
Pic your bitch photo booth
Nothing on me sorta cheap
So to speak go to beach
Bitch from Spain technically that's border breach
On that bread like I told the waiter wheat
Louie pants and I had to wait a week

5 blade fill our nose
Like a bitch get wet like hoes
Ain't no envy in me
And I empty clip on the enemy
You might also likeGucci Louie Fendi
I be shoppin there
I spend gwap in there
All this gwap in here
I need a gwap in here
Seats avocado I spilled guac in here
80 thousand dollars on
All the high fasion clothes
I buy gimmie gimmie
I get that dirt off my shoulder with a shimmy
Hit that first drivin' like bat out of helly

5 blade fill our nose
Like a bitch get wet like hoes
Ain't no envy in me
And I empty clip on the enemy
This a Hellcat you hear me HEMI?Embed
