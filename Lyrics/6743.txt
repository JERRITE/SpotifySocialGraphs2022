Hola! Welcome to the show
Ayy, ayy (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse: Cooliecut & XXXTENTACION]
Chokehold, locked in (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy!)
Might as well call it good night, ayy (Might as well call it good night, yeah)
Skull mask, death face (Yeah, yeah ayy!)
When I catch 'em, swear it's on sight, ayy (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, when I catch 'em, swear it’s on sight)
Blade on me, in my hand (Yeah)
Might as well cut a nigga up, uh (Cut a nigga up, ayy, ayy, ayy, fuck 'em up!)
Blood on my motherfucking shirt, hey (Ayy, ayy, ayy, blood on my shirt)
Motherfucking put 'em in a hearse, hey (Motherfuckin' put 'em in a- fuck them up!)
Motherfucking put 'em in the dirt, ayy (Yeah)
Living dead in this mothafucking thang, okay
Fuckin' on your lil' fuckin' main, okay (Hola)
Might even eat her motherfuckin' brains, okay
Like stab her ass up, touché (Hola)
Pick the heart out, bruh, who pray? (Who pray?)
I don't pray, boy, I look to the sky, my nigga (Ayy, yeah)
Then smoke on a blunt to get by, my nigga (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Like, okay
