Soft Currents Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seven years
I've had seven years of bad luck
And I'm just fine
Happiness
I find happiness in the wrong places
Every time

[Chorus]
My fate is at the hands of my mistakes
And that's alright
[Verse 2]
All the tears
All the tears I've shed, love
And I'm still crying
Happiness
I find happiness in the wrong places
Every time

[Chorus]
My fate is at the hand of my mistakes
And that's alright
My fate is in your hand
Without you even trying

[Chorus]
My fate is at the hands of my mistakes
And that's alrightYou might also like1Embed
