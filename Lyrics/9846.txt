[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Now this here is that bomb diggy (Diggy)
Diggy dang, the dons with me
Killa, he'll kill a nigga you thinkin' bout harming me
Capo's corrupted (Yup), he's the wrong vato to fuck with (Yup)
Labeled and known as a young Pac to the public
And me, Human Crack in the flesh (Flesh)
I'm the last of the best (Best)
One word to describe me (What?), spectacular, yes
So stay calm shorty, when you see that palmed .40 (.40?)
I'll pop it slow, you'll rock and roll, like Bon Jovi
So don't fool with the click (Ayy)
Don't fool with the Dips (Ayy)
You will die, you will lie in a pool full of shit (Ayy)
When that gun with the clip in (What)
Start dumpin' and rippin' (Yup)
At ya'll head, ya'll some dead summamabitches (Ayy)
You give a chick hard dick and bubblegum (Ayy)
I give a chick a hard brick and bubble-yum (Ayy)
Like here, take that, shake that, break that (Ayy)
In half and please bring my cake back

Live bitch, why kiss, on my wrist a glowworm ($50,000)
And I keep heat, cause in these streets (what you hear?)
Just hear "woop, woop, wamp, wamp, beep, beep" (that's the cops)
And you rumble: never. Me? Hit a humble diva (a few of 'em)
And I stay with the white, I got Jungle Fever (nose candy)
So tell Lucccy (what)

You'll get yellow-taped, outlined, etch-a-sketched
Killa
