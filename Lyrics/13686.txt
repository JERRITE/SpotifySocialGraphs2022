TranslationsDeutschRise Up Lyrics[Verse]
Rise up
I've been through the fire
Made it through the wire
I feel closer than I've ever been
Higher
I can feel the raindrops
Pourin' but I won't stop, no-o-o-oo

[Pre-Drop]
Don't forget me now
I believe in tomorrow
No time to borrow
Hear me out
Yeah, I do it all for you
[Drop]
Rise up
I've been through the fire
Made it through the wire
I feel closer than I've ever been
Higher
I can feel the raindrops
Pouring but I won't stop, no-o-o-oo
Don't forget me now
I believe in tomorrow
No time to borrow
Hear me out
Yeah, I do it all for you

[Post-Drop]
