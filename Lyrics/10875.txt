Call You in the Morning LyricsLove, I'm gonna call you in the morning
But I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say
I think I might be telling you I love you
And tomorrow's gonna be a whole new day

Love, I'm gonna call you in the morning
But I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do
I think I might be telling you I miss you
And I think you were the one that got me through
And I think you were the one that got me through
Love, I'm gonna call you in the morning
And I really hope this plan is going to fly
And I think I'm gonna tell you that you woke me
And I wanna say these words into your eyes

Oh, love, I think I reached the pinnacle whеn I landed with you (With you)
They all say I stumbled on a miraclе, but I just think it's you
I just think it's you (You)

Love, I'm gonna call you in the morning
I'll ring you after my first sip of light
I think I'm gonna tell you I've been thinking of a long road, and on it, you and I
Of a long road, and on it, you and I

Oh, love, I think I reached the pinnacle when I landed with you (With you)
They all say I stumbled on a miracle, but I just think it's you
I just think it's you (You)

Love, I'm gonna call you in the morning
But I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say
I think I might be telling you I love you
And tomorrow's gonna be a whole new day
And tomorrow's gonna be a whole new dayYou might also likeEmbed
