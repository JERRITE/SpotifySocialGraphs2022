TranslationsFrançaisLike I Can Lyrics[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner or a gentleman
He could be a preacher when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can
[Verse 3]
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He’ll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Bridge]
We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord, please

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, canYou might also like49Embed
