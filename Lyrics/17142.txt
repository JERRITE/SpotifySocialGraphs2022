Ambition of a Rider Lyrics[Intro]
Gang, skrt, gang. You know I'm rocking nigga boochie gang bitch. Get your guns up, get your funds up. You on that opp shit get mop sticked. Ay, ride on 'em nigga, we gon' ride on 'em nigga. Gon' slide on 'em nigga

[Verse 1]
This my ambitions as a rider
She wanna have my baby she told me to cum inside
That hoe must be crazy
Strapped up like the Navy
This a chopper, this ain't no .380
I was born in the '90s but they thought I was born in the '80s
Bitch I got the down home blues, all this blue cheese
Can't fit in my jeans, I'm surrounded by killers and thieves
Your bitch on her knees now they ashy
A nigga broke, he can't afford no feature then don't ask me
My niggas, grimy, tuck your chain they fuck around and snatch it
Bitch we leave a dread head bald, chopper bullets patch it
At your funeral can't see your face because the closed casket
And I'm leaving with the whole mall like I just got my taxes
My new car give you the ugly face like you eat sour patches
We can't find his ass, he was hiding, so we took it out on his rapping
Bitch on fleek like the mannequin buying that cheap shit you tacky
That Boy gon' fold, get in that hole, I know he gon' panic
I hit your ass with these big old .45 bullets
You bleeding, you can't breathe, trigger squeeze
Automatic .40s, I wish a nigga pull it
So I could show him I'm not pussy
Chopper knock a nigga out cold
Named it Micheal Watson fight all my battles bitch
Think don't think I'm talking about no boxing
Sit back and watch me
Cause you can't stop me
Bitch I'm the trending topic
She suck it sloppy
That bitch a fool, I love the way she top me
Feeling like Rocky, beat up my trap cause I need every profit
So what you need nigga? Want paraphernalia, come and cop it
Went to school with the rocket, kept that bitch up in my pocket
I pistol whip the back of your head, knock ya eye out the socket
I'll knock your ass out the picture nigga and I ain't have to crop it
Gang, you know we don't squash shit
So nigga don't start shit
Get a brick of that soft, get a QP of that hard shit
I'm tryna be cool
So I'm toting on this Tec with the cooler kit
Like Tajj Gibson me and my niggas be on that bullshit
Roll off the hip I up this bitch and hand you a full clip
Who wanna race? My car so fast it might do a full flip
Got to get to these chips, got my own cheese, now I can double dip
I just drunk a fifth but I'm probably gon' take another sip
Said she wanna see me but I probably link with another bitch
I just robbed that nigga on my way to go hit another lick
He was sneak dissing, pulled up with choppers, to confront shit
Niggas yell out they real but don't be on no 100 shit
[Verse 2]
Aye pussy niggas know we got the heaters when we slide
Pussy nigga, you gon' fuck around, need Jesus on your side
We ran up in a nigga house and his old lady was inside
Only reason we ain't flame it up, seen babies up inside
I lose my mind when I pop pills and I get crazy up inside
Thought he was a hot nigga till I put that laser on his ass
Left his ass in shock like I used my bitch taser on his ass
I get so high, get on 290 and just ride
Don't lose your life over your pride
If you want war with me just go out of town if you gon' hide
Look him in his eyes
That nigga had cried before he died
You better go and buy you a pistol nigga before you try
Niggas say they with you but hesitate when it's time to slide
Them niggas get quiet
Make me mad, I bring out my mask and get on your ass
This bitch fast, I'm hitting the gas, my engine in the ass
We beat your ass up in the club now we waiting outside
You got fo nem on your ass, boy your ass better not come outside
Pockets swole, shit can't even fold, my shit overload
Fucking hoes, tell her try my throat, tell her swing my door
Be my maid, bitch come clean my house, bitch come sweep the floor
Be my slave, he acting so brave, bullets hit his chest
Leave a case
Selling so much yay, you would think it was back in the day
Give me a 6 Trey, whip my wrist like it was a slave
You know I'm a dog, she a dog, I bought her a cage
She won't leave me alone, stalk my phone, she watching my page
Most my niggas gone, can't come home cause they fighting the case
Book me for a show, sent my check, I banked it with Chase
She told me she gay, fucked her and her friend yesterday
But these bitches can't stay
Open the door, send 'em away
You should be ashamed, you too old for subliminal games
Robbed so many niggas, all I knew bout was hitting a stain
Fuck this twitter beef, load up the pistols and kill ya today
If he fuck with me, that's why he got killers all in his face
You know that I sell dope, that nigga broke on minimum wage
This bitch call me bae, that's the stupidest shit she could say
Get in my lane and get ranned over in my Chevrolet
26's, blue kisses, Forgiatos, and candy paint
Niggas diss on the internet but see me and turn they face
I just bought a new chopper, that's my babe
We on a date
These niggas last but I came in first place
Didn't even race
