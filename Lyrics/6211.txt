In My Room Lyrics[Verse 1: Young Rising Sons]
Lately I've been praying, but I'm not religious
Trying to talk to Jesus through my television
Confessing all my secrets, but they never change
I promise him I mean it, but I'm still the same
Driving just to see you from New York to Texas
Rip my heart in half and hang it from your necklace
It's like you always know exactly what to say
To talk me off the ledge when I'm about to break
But I know what's holy now
[Chorus: Young Rising Sons & Sizzy Rocket]
There's a light on in my room
When I'm with you
Every view feels like
Watching the world
Up on the moon
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, in my room

[Verse 2: Sizzy Rocket]
Melt into the floor and lose ourselves for hours
Swimming in the silence when it's all around us
You can hear my thoughts and I can read your mind
All you have to do is say it with your eyes
Yeah, I know what's holy now (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Rising Sons & Sizzy Rocket]
There's a light on in my room
When I'm with you
Every view feels like
Watching the world
Up on the moon
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, in my room
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, in my room

[Verse 3: Young Rising Sons with Sizzy Rocket, & Sizzy Rocket]
So put me back together
Talk me off the ledge when
I'm about to free fall
But I could fall forever (I could fall, I could fall, I could fall, I could fall)
Don't care if we wreck it
It's something to live for
So put me back together
Talk me off the ledge when
I'm about to free fall (Ooh, ooh)
But I could fall forever
Yeah, I could fall forever

There's a light on in my room
When I'm with you
Every view feels like
Watching the world
Up on the moon
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, in my room (Ooh)Embed
