Violet Lyrics[Verse]
Don't cut your journey short
Not anymore
You beautiful boy
Just run
Don't hit the floor
Not anymore
You brilliant boy
Just chill, you're made to sing
On anything, you golden child
[Chorus]
You're my violet in the sun
You're my violet in the sun
You're my violet in the sun
You're my violet in the sun

[Outro]
We've often lost our way
All we ask is that you lead today
Give us strength, most holy Lord
Strength to meet this day
Lead us by your holy word
Guide us in-You might also like12Embed
