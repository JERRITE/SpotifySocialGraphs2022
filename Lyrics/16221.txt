​newbury park Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a lot to say for someone miles away
Another lonely afternoon in Chinatown
I put my make-up on just to take it off
Your favorite pastime is letting me down

[Chorus]
Newbury Park's pretty far from LA
Traffic is bad but I came anyway
You’ll never think that I'm good enough
So fuck you for wasting my love
Fuck you for wasting my love
Fuck you for wasting my love
[Verse 2]
I wanna burn my bed
You ruined Radiohead
Oh, what's that song called?
You know the one we fell in love to
I slam my door to your car
Every time you break my heart
This should be easy, but loving you is so damn

[Chorus]
Newbury Park’s pretty far from LA
Traffic is bad but I came anyway
You'll never think that I'm good enough
So fuck you for wasting my love
Fuck you for wasting my love
Wasting my love

[Bridge]
Sorry's just a word unless you mean it
Go on wasting my love
Sorry's just a word unless you feel it
Go on wasting my love

[Outro]
Fuck you for wasting my love
Wasting my love
Fuck you for wasting my love
I'm better off without you
I'm better off without you
I'm better off without you
I’m better off without you
Fuck you for wasting my loveYou might also like4Embed
