The Bender (Party Pupils Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
Do you remember
The very first night of September?
You were actin' all nice at the bender
But you ain't so sweet, are you, lover?
Made me suffer
You had me thinkin'
That you'd stay the night on the weekend
But you're all talk girl, no reason
Well, baby, it's okay, we're even
Keep on leavin'
[Chorus]
Ah-ee-ah (Ah-ee-ah), say, do you remember
Ah-ee-ah, dancin' at the bender?
Ah-ee-ah, there never was a night you'd stay

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Ah-ee-ah, say, do you remember
Ah-ee-ah, dancin' at the bender?
Ah-ee-ah, there never was a night you'd stay
