Badfish Lyrics[Intro]
Shut up
(Oh my God!)
How's it going, dude?
Hey, man, what's up?
(Tell Todd he can turn the radio back on)

[Verse 1]
When you grab a hold of me
You tell me that I'll never be set free
But I'm a parasite
Creep and crawl, I step into the night
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Two pints of booze
Tell me, are you a badfish, too?
Are you a badfish, too? But

[Chorus 1]
Ain't got no money to spend
I hope the night will never end
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're a big blue whale
Grab the reef when all duck divin' fails
I swim, but I wish I never learned
The water's too polluted with germs

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
Grab the reef underneath my bed
It's underneath my bed, but

[Chorus 2]
Ain't got no quarrels with God
Ain't got no time to grow old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

(I gotta go, dude)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Ain't got no quarrels with God
Ain't got no time to get old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?38Embed
