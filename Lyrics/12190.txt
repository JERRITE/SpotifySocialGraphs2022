Close Your Eyes (’til It’s Over) LyricsAnd she waits underneath this fall from grace
Reaching up for you
And you are taking her hand
Cause you know where she's been
She's holding on for you
Beyond the eyes of someone

You almost let it go
Just close your eyes 'til it's over
You turn around so you can run
You can run or wait 'til it's over
We are what we are not
And she waits cause she always wait for grace
To understand the truth
And she wait for her light
To lead her tonight
It's leading back to you
You are only way back to someone
You almost let it go
Just close your eyes 'til it's over
You turn around so you can run
You can run or wait 'til it's over
We are what we are not

You let it go
Just close your eyes 'til it's over
You turn around so you can run
You can run or wait 'til it's over
We are what we are not

You run away from life
Right when we need you
Cause you can't bring me here
You are running tonight
Cause no one believes youYou might also likeEmbed
