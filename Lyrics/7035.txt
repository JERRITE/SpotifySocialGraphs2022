Carry Me Home Lyrics[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
Midnight strikes, where is my prince?
Lost my comfort, more time to think
Broken and bruised, tell me what I am
Feel so unused, help me find your hand

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
I guess the sun still waits here
Got to hold it up for him

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home
Nothing else matters
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home and don't let go
[Verse 2: Maverick Sabre]
Say, said I don't ever say things, so you can heal
Yet I waited all for your seas to fill
Now this bottle seems too hard to place down and leave to help
And now I feel like I've become your pain
You darlin' won't be saved with me

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith, Maverick Sabre & Both]
Oh, I guess the sun still waits here
Got to hold it up for him

[Chorus: Jorja Smith, Maverick Sabre & Both]
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders (No, oh-oh)
Carry me home
Nothing else matters
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home
And don't let go

[Outro: Jorja Smith, Maverick Sabre & Both]
I guess I'm still here waiting
Darling, I'm sorry I tried
I gotta hold it up for himYou might also like12Embed
