Mother & Father Lyrics[Verse 1]
The nights are getting shorter
I don’t know where they go
And I am getting older
And it's starting to show

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And ever since I left my mother
It’s much harder to know
How to make my own life here
How to make my own home
[Chorus]
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind

[Verse 2]
I remember the time when a kiss on the hand was enough
'Cause we knew we were free
And we knew what it meant to be loved

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But ever since I left my father
It’s much harder to know
How to live my own life here
When all I need is home

[Chorus]
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind

As faces start to fade
They’re slipping through my hands
It's where my heart was made
And my feet will always land

[Chorus]
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely
I don’t want to just be fine
I don't want to keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind
I don’t want to wake up lonely19Embed
