Vowels (and the Importance of Being Me) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man is crippled and dead and
Meek and eager in his sin
Turn around, say you love the way I
Hang around, that you miss the spark in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a queen last night, yeah
I said "Take to the water"
And let you drink my lies
Like, "Okay, you're right"
[Chorus]
You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U

You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U

[Verse 2]
It's not at all unusual
To melt like a ball of wax or
To take what I didn't ask for, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a queen last night, yeah
I said "Take to the water"
And let you drink my lies
Like, "Okay, you're right"

[Chorus]
You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U

You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U
You might also like[Bridge]
Well, it's important being me, yeah
It's so important being me, hey

[Chorus]
You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U

You can't spell pain or kiss
Or run away or little mistake
Without me, or A, E, I, O, U12Embed
