Bit of Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
You caught me looking at you
Laughing uncontrollably
It’s undefined in the dining room
Underneath the table with your hands on my knee

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can call me "Baby"
I feel like I’m stalling
You can call me "Baby"
[Chorus]
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me

[Verse 2]
I caught you looking at me
Taking note of everything
You closed your eyes, heavy blinds to a house
I want everything inside to spill out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(You can call me "Baby")
You can call me "Baby"
Sounds good from your mouth (Ooh)
You can call me "Baby"

[Chorus]
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me
You might also like[Bridge]
In the thinness of the darkness
In the great scale of the night
I’m leaning against you
Like I’m leaning on a wall that’s never gonna fall down

[Chorus]
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me
A bit of rain
A bit of thunder
I love the exchange
I want you under me

[Outro]
You can call me "Baby"
You can call me "Baby"Embed
