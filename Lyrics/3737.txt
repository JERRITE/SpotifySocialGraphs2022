Into the Abyss Lyrics[Intro: Nyassa]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Pressure]
I feel like I've been here before
Real-life or dreamin', unsure
When all my travels could all unravel
In a heartbeat or a thought
And if my legacy's abolished
Then whatever we accomplished
Did it for the pedigree, I don't see an enemy
Then to me, y'all are potentially accomplice
'Cause some men rise above
Some men fight enough
Till their struggling becomes them and are defined as such
Who the fuck then divided us?
It's like I'm born every mornin', die every evenin'
War at my door revivin' my demons
I'd rather die with my convictions
Than live a life with no meaning, so I
Hold court like the king of the mountain hall
Everyone, everything is accountable
Face the music and embrace the truth of
All that makes us human then I think I'd be proud of y'all
If I am, all I said I am
And we are, all in together and
From where I stand I'm just tryna get a plan
To build a better man for this Neverland
Maybe a dreamer, make believer
Try escape the ether
But the great deceiver
Lives inside to feed a basic need for
Identity of own, set me in stone
Near my legacy to grow then I'll never be alone
It's the music that'll ferry me to home
[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I'm not lost, I've been followin' my own path
Not blind, been lookin' at my future, not past
Ain't done, starin' into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been followin' my own path
Not blind, been lookin' at my future, not past
Ain't done, starin' into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Ayy
Feel like I've been here before
In the abyss, lookin' up to the great expanse
Stars in the sky, stars in my eyes
Won't stop till their stars in my hands
Feel like I landed on Mars
I feel abandoned, in fact
They're all on Dancin' with Stars
Makin' fun of artists who actually rap
I lost my confidence
Till I got on my flex
Now can't tell me nothin', city all sufferin'
Tell God he got a Suffa complex
I'm draped in the belt of Orion
I'm prayin' the truth rings out
They're sayin' the loud things quiet
We're sayin' the quiet things loud
I wanna rock right now
Want every single rapper on the block wiped out
Everybody comin' at the Hilltop, lights out
You're runnin' down seconds on the clock, time out
What? Pipe down, we don't care what you think of us
We're the shit and you can't sit with us
You're tryna fly by clingin' to Icarus
I'm tryna drive by liquor and cigarettes
I'm tryna be a better man, ask Eddie Vedder, man
I'm tryna be Clark
I feel like Letterman
Hidin' my venom in a coffee mug with a broken heart
Open bars
Probably gonna kill me if all this tourin' don't
From the heart sincerely
All I want really is to watch my children grow

I'm not lost, I've been followin' my own path
Not blind, been lookin' at my future, not past
Ain't done, starin' into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me
I'm not lost, I've been followin' my own path
Not blind, been lookin' at my future, not past
Ain't done, starin' into the abyss daily
Until that man in the mirror ain't me2Embed
