Tangled Up in You Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heart, your heart
So intertwined
My skin on your skin
It feels so right
I run my fingers down your spine
When I touch, you touch
Electrified

[Chorus]
No one is standing in the way of desire
Who holds the power now
Seconds stretch out into hours
As both of us break down
[Verse 2]
You trust, I trust
We crossed that line
I want what I want
And I want you tonight
My eyes still wander through your eyes
Diving deeper down inside

[Chorus]
No one is standing in the way of desire
Who holds the power now
Seconds stretch out into hours
As both of us break down

[Bridge]
And I'll save more of my love for you
I'll save more love for the one I still presume
Tangled up with you
I'll always be tangled up in you
In you and me
Powerless
Do you stop what's coming next
Powerless
Do you stop it
We lose ourselves in the [?]
When the moment's right
Now that we know the damage
You might also like[Chorus]
No one is standing in the way of desire
Who holds the power now
Seconds stretch out into hours
As both of us break down

[Outro]
And I save all my love for you
Now I save all of it for the one I still presume
Tangled up with you
I'll always be tangled in you
In you and me
There's nothing we won't do
(Nothing we won't do)
You and me
Tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
In you and me
Tangled up in you and me
Tangled up in you
You and me
You and meEmbed
