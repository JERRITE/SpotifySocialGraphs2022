Holding My Own Hand LyricsYes I know when you give out your love you don't give it to get any back
But I'd hope that person who needed me there would be there if I asked
But what they don't tell you is that you don't need that

I got so used to having a hand to hold I didn't know what to do
When I thought in my darkest you'd be there but now I know that isn't true
Cause you only want me when I'm there to fix you
When the part that kills me is that I'd still love to

But I just wanna thank you for not being there for me
And I think you should know just what your selfishness has taught me
And evеn though it hurts like hell to feel alone again
Bеcause of you I got a chance at holding my own hand
Mmm
At holding my own hand
Mmm
At holding my own hand

Learned my lesson, I tried and I tested and nothing I did I would change
Now I'm here doing it all on my own and I feel more proud than in pain
You know I'm still hurting and feel like I need it
But I'm merely learning how to love me without you

But I just wanna thank you for not being there for me
And I think you should know just what your selfishness has taught me
And even though it hurts like hell to feel alone again
Because of you I got a chance at holding my own hand

Mmm
At holding my own hand
Mmm
At holding my own hand
Holding my own hand
At holding my own hand

And I get now that it just wasn't meant to be
So don't bother saying sorry

But I just wanna thank you for not being there for me
And I think you should know just what your selfishness has taught me
And even though it hurts like hell to feel alone again
Because of you I got a chance at holding my own hand

At holding my own hand
Mmm
At holding my own hand
Holding my own hand
At holding my own handEmbed
