Let Me Think About It (Celebration Club Mix) Lyrics[Drop]
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
'Bout it
'Bout it

[Verse 1]
Come on girl believe me I'll make you see
That I am the true way to ecstasy
Touch me, feel me, then you will find
That we are meant to be and I ain't lying
[Drop]
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it

[Verse 2]
You say you want me
You say you need me
You say you love me
How come your leaving?
You say you want me
You say you need me
You say you love me
How come your leaving?

[Drop]
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about itYou might also likeEmbed
