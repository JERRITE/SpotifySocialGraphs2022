Drip Day N Night Lyrics[Intro: Lil Gotit]
Woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah
(10Fifty, I love you)

[Chorus: Lil Gotit & Gunna]
Might fuck on a freak, I'ma beat it like a ring
Then leave, I'll take you to a flight (Woah, woah, woah)
I don't care what the tag, got money on my brain
And you know we gon' live alright
Know I did a couple of things, I was livin' off of shame
But shit, I made it right
Went and copped a couple chains, and I'm stayin' in my lane
I'm drippin' shit day to night (Woah, woah, woah)
Drippin' shit day to night, I drip shit day to night (I drip shit day to night)
We are not the same, I'm poppin' champagne and eatin' lo mein on the flight
Higher than a plane, codeine in my veins, ain't none of my soda be light
My vibe got a friend, God keepin' me sane, I'ma go and paint everything white
[Verse 1: Lil Gotit]
Don't care about a thing
Blood on the money like I blew a nigga brains
Gettin' to the money, don't know 'bout can't
Leave with her again, had two different dates
We all about business, don't play no games
Wanna make you a milli', come join the money team
Put peanut butter seats in the Mulsanne
No imposter, double-C animal
Havin' flights, we ain't havin' no latitude

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Havin' lunch, your bitch, she edible
I told her my dick incredible
You worth it, I'ma put you on a pedestal
I'ma dive in the pussy like a cannonball
She can keep a nigga focused like an Adderall
Gotta keep Percocet like Tylenol
She comin' back and forth for sex like a volleyball
Cool on the Polo
I ain't budgin', if you ratchet, it's a no-no
I ain't bust a plain Patek, that's a no-no
I left Barney's, I was shoppin' in SoHo (Yeah)
La Familia, this ain't just a logo (Yeah)
YSL, fuck a cell and the po-po
In the G-Wagen smashin' down Melrose
And a chopper with a bullet in the barrel
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Gotit & Gunna]
Might fuck on a freak, I'ma beat it like a ring
Then leave, I'll take you to a flight (Woah, woah, woah)
I don't care what the tag, got money on my brain
And you know we gon' live alright
Know I did a couple of things, I was livin' off of shame
But shit, I made it right
Went and copped a couple chains, and I'm stayin' in my lane
I'm drippin' shit day to night (Woah, woah, woah)
Drippin' shit day to night, I drip shit day to night (I drip shit day to night)
We are not the same, I'm poppin' champagne and eatin' lo mein on the flight
Higher than a plane, codeine in my veins, ain't none of my soda be light
My vibe got a friend, God keepin' me sane, I'ma go and paint everything white

[Verse 3: Gunna]
No cap in my gang, catch a body, ain't sayin' no names
Got some money, everybody actin' strange
When I had nothin', I could barely get a, "Hey"
Believe that, yeah, young GunnaWunna got the wave
I'm knowin' you can see that, so why you callin' me conceited?

[Verse 4: Lil Keed]
Yeah (Keed, talk to 'em)
I ain't with the chit-chat, hundred round drum in the backpack
I'll pop a Perc' just to relax, throw a lotta money, yeah, a lotta racks
Stop by Jeffrey, get real CC (Let's go)
Pull up packs in the trap, let's beat
Jumped in the coupe and the seats match your feet
He was just piped up, now he on E
That's on me (Keed, talk to 'em)
Got a lot of millions, fifteen-hundred on jeans
It's just me and Slatt Gotit, know we gon' handle that business (Me and Slatt Gotit)
And we ain't goin' back and forth, shit, it is what it is (We ain't goin')
I'ma go and get a million-dollar deal and try to take care the kids
[Chorus: Lil Gotit & Gunna]
Might fuck on a freak, I'ma beat it like a ring
Then leave, I'll take you to a flight (Woah, woah, woah)
I don't care what the tag, got money on my brain
And you know we gon' live alright
Know I did a couple of things, I was livin' off of shame
But shit, I made it right
Went and copped a couple chains, and I'm stayin' in my lane
I'm drippin' shit day to night (Woah, woah, woah)
Drippin' shit day to night, I drip shit day to night (I drip shit day to night)
We are not the same, I'm poppin' champagne and eatin' lo mein on the flight
Higher than a plane, codeine in my veins, ain't none of my soda be light
My vibe got a friend, God keepin' me sane, I'ma go and paint everything white2Embed
