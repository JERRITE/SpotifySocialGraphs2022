Pisces Moon LyricsI survive on a second chance
I feel your love secondhand
It's someone else's flowers on the table
But I don't mind

I'm crawling through your window, babe
I’m falling at your feet again
Right before you run out the door
I’m calling your name

And I'm trying to be less volatile
And I’m finding new ways to get high
But I do it again every time
I can't walk away with my pride
I'm always running after that train
I’m always running after that boy
After he leaves me at the station again
'Cause I know it's in his heart to be good
Yeah, I know it's in your heart
He was born with the Pisces moon
Dim light and honeydew
And I know that he'll never love me
But I can't let it go

He's walking through my dreams again
In the palm of someone else's hand
His dark eyes still watching me spinning
Through the chemical glow

And I'm always staring at my phone
I’m always trying to get you alone
The wires got crossed along the way
Now I’m standing here with nothing to say
Fell in love with the Pisces moon
Now I’ll follow you wherever you go
'Til you leave me at the altar some day
Well I think that I’d love you anyway
Yeah, I know that I’d love you anywayYou might also likeEmbed
