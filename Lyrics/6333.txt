Don’t Wait Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Waiting on the phone to ring and wake us up again
Lost inside a dream with halls that never seem to end
Falling from the ceiling, I keep crawling on the floor
Can't avoid the feeling this has happened all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I stumble out of my home
I'm looking out every now and then
If I'm leaving my home
I don't know when I'll be back again
[Chorus]
So don’t you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
I've got a restless mind

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the phone to ring and shake me up again
Pull me out from underneath the state that I've been in
Searching for a reason, I've been looking for the door
Nothings gonna keep me here just waiting anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I stumble out of my home
I'm looking out every now and then
If I'm leaving my home
I don't know when I'll be back again

[Chorus]
So don’t you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
I've got a restless mind

[Chorus]
So don't you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind

[Chorus]
Don't you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind

[Chorus]
Don't you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
I've got a restless mind

I've got a restless mind18Embed
