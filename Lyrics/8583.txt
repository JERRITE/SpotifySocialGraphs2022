FBI Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, turn it up, up, up
Okay, okay
Ay
I walk on stage and I act like pastor was my past life
Throw some water on the crowd now
Bitches think they got baptized
Sweat running down my back like why she hugging me that tight?
She just told me I'm a handsome devil
Hmm baby you half right
[Verse 1]
Hop off the stage then right to the plane, my life is a whirlwind
The ass on the stewardess make me wonder why I got a girlfriend
I fly out a chick from my city, show her how pretty the world is
If she don't say "Thank you" I fly to France and leave her in Berlin
Good guy in a bad mood, I don't really drink but realistically I start soon
Is it not a hit for the radio to start to whole lotta popcorn, baby get the smart food
In the dark room I just wanna fuck a little, she just wanna argue
This the only way to get rid of my stress, so if you don't fuck you don't care about me yet

[Chorus]
Hold secrets like I hold these chicks
You don't get them from me (Okay)
NDA in my DNA, I don't tell nobody (Okay)
Siren on the car like I'm about to help somebody (Okay)
FIB to the FBI, I don't tell nobody
Hold secrets like I hold these chicks
You don't get them from me (Okay)
NDA in my DNA, I don't tell nobody (Okay)
Siren on the car like I'm about to help somebody (Okay)
(Ay) FIB (Ay) to the FBI (Ay) I don't tell nobody (Ay)

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna know my home base (Home base)
Keep it on the low, you gotta locate (Locate)
Look up all the bodies in the cold place (Cold place)
Put it to your dome, get out my domain (Brrrr)
Kill 'em in the morning like I'm OJ (OJ)
Kill 'em in the morning with my OJ
Wicked what the fuck I let my clothes say
This ain't Obey, this is Dolce
Gone with old ways, gone with old days
Phone is cracked now, lost my phone case
Fuck your due dates, tell 'em I'm on island time like Guantanamo Bay
Aloha baby, como estas, como esma, got to rotate
Find a new girl, she falling for me, I fall but don't break, the domino way, uh
This my shit, you called in, told my girl that we are in
But you can't mean the world to me, I went and seen all of it
This my shit, happy with it
Been a bit of time since I asked permission
Rather do it anyway and ask forgiveness
If I fuck up, it was accidented
You might also like[Chorus]
Hold secrets like I hold these chicks, you don't get them from me
(Okay)
NDA in my DNA, I don't tell nobody (Okay)
Siren on the car like I'm about to help somebody (Okay)
FIB to the FBI, I don't tell nobody
Hold secrets like I hold these chicks, you don't get them from me
(Okay)
NDA in my DNA, I don't tell nobody (Okay)
Siren on the car like I'm about to help somebody (Okay)
FIB to the FBI, I don't tell nobody
(Okay)3Embed
