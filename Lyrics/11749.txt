Lord It’s a Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw the way you made her feel
Like she should be somebody else
I saw the way she tried to hold you
When your heart was just a shell
I saw the words she wrote that broke my heart
It was a living hell
I saw the way you laughed behind her back
When you fucked somebody else

I saw the way you made her feel
Like she should be somebody else
I know you think the stars align for you
And not for her as well
I undеrstand, I can admit
That I have felt those things mysеlf
I saw the way you laughed behind her back
When you fucked somebody else
[Chorus]
Lord, it's a feeling
It comes to find you
Lord, it’s a feeling
That I felt

[Verse 2]
If it's convenient for you
You want her love, she'll give you more
That’s when your words are so convincing
Say you'll try until she's sure that you will change
I can admit that I have been right here before
But on that morning when you're proud
You said I fucked somebody of course

[Chorus]
Lord, it's a feeling
It comes to find you
Lord, it's a feeling
(That I felt)
It comes to find you
(Like no one else)
When the rest of us have nothing left
She won't be yours
Lord, it's a feeling
That I felt
Lord, it’s a feeling

[Bridge]
Feeling, it will come to find you
Feeling, it will come to find you
Feeling, it will come to find you
(Lord, it’s a feeling)
Feeling, it will come to find you
Feeling, it will come to find you
Feeling, it will come to find you

[Chorus]
Lord, it's a feeling
That I felt
It comes to find you
Like no one else
When the rest of us have nothing left
She won’t be yours
When the rest of us have nothing left
She won't be yoursEmbed
