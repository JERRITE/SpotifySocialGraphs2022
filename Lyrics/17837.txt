WOO Forever Lyrics[Intro]
Sinister (When we posted all we do is body beats)
Nine shots in the Ruger, uh

[Chorus]
I'm in the Murcielago (Murcielago)
But we doin' hits out the Tahoe (Brrt, baow)
I make her drink from the bottle (Bottle)
We make a move and they follow (Follow, follow, follow)
She wanna fuck, I know (I know)
I'm in love with my bitch, still got feelings for my side ho (Treesha)
Wanna beef with the gang? I told them niggas to sign up (Sign up)
She pickin' and choosin', I told that bitch make her mind up (Make her mind up)
Look (Look), I got on all the designer (Woo)
We hit 'em up, we sit 'em back, recline 'em
[Verse]
Nine shots, I give these bitches to drool on me (Drool on me)
I went to school wit' the tool on me (Got the tool on me, got the tool on me)
I'm wit' some shooters that shoot for me (Woah)
I pop out, I'm makin' your boo horny (Ha)
She wanna fuck, she gotta go link the gang first (Go link the gang first)
She callin' me "M" 'cause that's what I told her my name worth (Name worth, name worth)
Look, look, lost Pop and the pain hurt (Pain hurt)
Tryna stay focused, I drink on this liquor and take Percs (Woo)
Two steppin' (Yup), I hit it first, we don't do seconds (Nope)
Come to the Floss and you knew check in
Clase Azul 'fore the mood set in (Look, look)
I link her once, kiss on her neck, get it too wetter (Mwah, mwah)
He doin' bad, that nigga a clown, gotta do better (Dummy)
She think she my bitch, G'd you (G'd you)
No, we don't fuck wit' them people (People)
I been outside, 2009, I had it tucked in Evisus (Baow)
She outta line, I'll break her spine, I'll put that bitch in a fetal (Wait)
When you make them posts, do not compare me, none of these niggas my equal (Equal, equal)

[Chorus]
I'm in the Murcielago (Murcielago)
But we doin' hits out the Tahoe (Brrt, baow)
I make her drink from the bottle (Bottle)
We make a move and they follow (Follow, follow, follow)
She wanna fuck, I know (I know)
I'm in love with my bitch (What?), still got feelings for my side ho
Wanna beef with the gang? I told them niggas to sign up (Sign up)
She pickin' and choosin', I told that bitch make her mind up (Make her mind up)
Look (Look), I got on all the designer (Woo)
We hit 'em up, we sit 'em back, recline 'emYou might also like2Embed
