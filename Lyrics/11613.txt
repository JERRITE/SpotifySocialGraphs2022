​zombie girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
What a dream that was
I almost couldn't wake because
I was frozen in bed with a zombie girl
Vacant as a closed down fair

[Verse 2]
Sleep paralysis, I sworn I could’ve felt you there
And I almost could've kissed your hair
But the emptiness withdrew me
From any kind of wishful prayer
[Chorus]
Oh, emptiness
Tell me 'bout your nature
Maybe I’ve been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

[Verse 3]
Then the next night
Dreaming I could feel your skin
But the dream escaped so easily
And I wokе up to the road again

[Verse 4]
How your words ring through
Something kinda sweet and blue
And I knеw that you'd been understanding
Everything that I'd said, too

[Chorus]
About emptiness
Tell me 'bout your nature
Maybe I've been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What’s on your mind?
In your mind2Embed
