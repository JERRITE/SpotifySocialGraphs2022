Ooo girl you're so fine
Can I get a minute of your time?
I wanna get to know ya
Maybe later on up in my crib
I'll get to show ya
You're blowin' my mind
You're one of a kind
Heard you like to get your freak on
So c'mon, let's get it on
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Whatever you want
Girl it's all you need
From your head to your feet
Know you got me open
And it ain't my sack of smokes
That's got me chokin'
You got me on a high
Oh girl I can't deny
That you keep me satisfied
Roll with me tonight

Tonight I will do
I will keep you satisfied
I will do just what you like
If you want me to
Anything you want me
That is what I'm gonna do

[ Rap by Triip ]
Give a little time
And i'm a tell you what to do
Come and step up like a champ
And I'm a see if I could check for ya
Looking like a winner for my dinner
I don't even know ya
But I'm a give you the eyes
And get the numerics
Lyrically you're gifted with the gab
Intending to persue it
Like to get the freak on
Just like the song
But we gotta get familiar
Only then we'll get it on
