TranslationsDeutschâ€‹all i can see Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I had friends
I wish I had anyone to save me
But I ain't like them (Like them)
I'm just a nightmare in the making
I pray that this ends
That the Baphomet will take me
Away from loose ends
'Cause I'm not to be forsaken
Maybe it's a part of me, the anxiety
But the funny thing is it's all I can see
And it lies to me
Fucking blinding me
While I honestly just
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm on drugs
Even though I don't even take 'em
It's fucking me up
Ride these highs to feel complacent
It's like I'm on drugs
I hide sometimes so I feel safe from
The pain in my gut
Yeah, it's fucking me up
Feels like I'm on drugs, yeah

[Verse 2]
I should dive in (I should dive in)
Swim to the surface when I'm stable
Let's skip the pretend (Let's skip the pretend)
'Cause this life is not a fable
This story don't end (This story don't end)
Till I'm hooked to all these cables
And start to see red (And start to see red)
As they lie me on the table
Maybe it's the start of things
Something I can't see
It's beyond a dream, an advisory
And it lies to me
Fucking blinding me
When I honestly just
You might also like[Chorus]
Feel like I'm on drugs
Even though I don't even take 'em
It's fucking me up
Ride these highs to feel complacent
It's like I'm on drugs
I hide sometimes so I feel safe from
The pain in my gut
Yeah, it's fucking me up

[Outro]
Somebody wake me
'Cause life is a daydream
And I'm wasting time with you
So many faces
Yeah, I'm losing patience
And I'm stuck on loving you
Feels like I'm on drugs
Yeah, feels like I'm on drugs
Feels like I'm on drugs
Feels like I'm on drugs
Yeah, yeah3Embed
