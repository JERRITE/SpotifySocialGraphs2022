TV Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
How I wish I’d called you up just to hear you breathe
The sound of serotonin makes it hard for me to sleep
I need to ask you questions
Like would you want to dance?
There’s demons in our mind, and they scream when it’s too bright
We’re animals in costume, tonight we’re dressed in white
I need to get the words out
Like poetry ain’t dead yet, it ain’t dead yet

[Chorus]
I wanna take you dancin', I wanna paint the street
Take my lungs if you need to breathe
Take my heart if you need a beat
I wanna take you dancin', like on a silver screen
Still young, we were born into a TV dream
[Verse 2]
How I wish I’d called your name out
But I couldn’t see your eyes
The audience aren't watchin', 'cause tonight we’re in disguise
The world don’t know her name yet
And the world don’t know her face
She slips away

[Chorus]
I wanna take you dancin', I wanna paint the street
Take my lungs if you need to breathe
Take my heart if you need to beat
I wanna take you dancin', like on a silver screen
Still young, we were born into a TV dream

[Bridge]
When the world has lost its mind
With plastic love, with space and time
Will boys and girls still play the same?
The news will say we’ll all be fine
I don’t believe what I’m seeing
On the TV screen
I can’t believe what I’m hearing
It makes no sense to me
Don’t need no excuses
Like why’d you get dressed like that?
If you could take it back, would you take it back?
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna take you dancin', I wanna paint the street
Take my lungs if you need to breathe
Take my heart if you need a beat
I wanna take you dancin', like on a silver screen
Still young, we were born into a TV dream1Embed
