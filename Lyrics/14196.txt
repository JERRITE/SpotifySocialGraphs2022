Doctors & Dealers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey politician on a mission, clean my pockets out
To feed your family, something else to fill your daughter’s mouth
You scam and scavenge as the rest of us try getting by
And yet you’re seen as such a hero to the public eye

They’ll never ask about your clothes or shiny car
Won’t give a second thought to why you’re buying out the bar
A man of status, high and mighty, better than us all
As all those worthy of your glory thirst to watch you fall
A baby kissing office holder, secrets hide a scourge
Your feet back in a swivel chair as chaos takes its course
I’d say you’re fooling no one but I’d only fool myself

[Chorus]
Peoplе of the town, lend us your ears now if you will
Thе doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fill
A place that where you stand is on the people that you crush
It goes to show the underdog is all you’ll learn to trust

People of the world feel free to step into the mix
The doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fix
They’ll chew you up and spit you out just for a touch of gold
With methods of their claim to fame all bottled up and sold

[Verse 2]
Write a prescription up for fiction, swallow fairy tales
Chase the princess down by throwing back your patient’s ale
Hung diplomas cover up the hollows in the walls
A storage place for pretty face to go inject his soul

Still no one asks what makes you look so dull and pale
Your antics are enough to throw the average man in jail
A Nixon of the modern age, your Watergate runs clear
But waterfall’s not loud enough for ignorance to hear

I’d say you’re fooling no one but I’d only fool myself
You might also like[Chorus]
People of the town, lend us your ears now if you will
The doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fill
A place that where you stand is on the people that you crush
It goes to show the underdog is all you’ll learn to trust

People of the world feel free to step into the mix
The doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fix
They’ll chew you up and spit you out just for a touch of gold
With methods of their claim to fame all bottled up and sold

[Break]

[Chorus]
People of the town, lend us your ears now if you will
The doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fill
A place that where you stand is on the people that you crush
It goes to show the underdog is all you’ll learn to trust

People of the world feel free to step into the mix
The doctors and the dealers trying hard to get their fix
They’ll chew you up and spit you out just for a touch of gold
With methods of their claim to fame all bottled up and sold

Oh!
[Outro]
Lead this world into a frenzy, baby
Doubling up as actors as you speak into the crowd
But, who believes you?
Quite the performance you’ve conveyed sir
My respects are overdue
So very, very overdueEmbed
