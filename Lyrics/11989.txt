[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm me, uh, I feel like I'm me
This ain't no tattoo on my arms, this that Gaultier on my sleeves
Said she can't believe, uh, said she— uh
Said she can't believe, uh, she's tellin' in front of me, uh
I'ma let her see, she balance up on her beam
I tiptoe, make her scream
I fell in love with a demon, and I can't get her out of my sheets
I fell in love with a freak, I can't get her out my sheets
And I can't get time alone, yeah
I can't get time alone, yeah
I gotta get time alone, yeah
I can't get my mind off what I did with the dough
I remember I spent it, I spent it (Woo, woo), I spent it (Hey)
I spent it (Hey), I spent it (Hey), I spent it (Hey), I spent it
I spent it, I spent it , I spent it (Hey), I spent it
I spent it, I spent it (Hey), I spent it, I spent it
I spent it, I spent it, I spent, yeah

Gorgeous, yeah, she flawless

I got her dragging her mink
She wanna fuck with a prince
I pull up with the Cuban link
No underwear when we link
She popped the perc like a mint
She really tryna go in
I lay it down in the whip
Can't see this shit through the tints
I ain't really tryna be friends
She already know what I meant
Continental the room with a vent
Told sweetie, "This ain't a tent"
My baby, she know what it is
My lady, she know what it is
She ain't tryna let me slip
She tell her friends I'm a myth

[Chorus]
Gorgeous, yeah, she flawless
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she flawless
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she flawless, yeah, yeah (I feel like I'm me, I feel like I'm me)
She gorgeous, yeah, she flawless (I feel like I'm me)
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she flawless
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she— yeah
I fly overseas, she fell in love
Buy her Celine, she fell in love
I'm just being me, she fell in love
I'm just being me, she fell in love
I fly overseas, she fell in love
Buy her Celine, she fell in love
I'm just being me, she fell in love
I'm just being me, she fell in love, yeah, yeah1Embed
