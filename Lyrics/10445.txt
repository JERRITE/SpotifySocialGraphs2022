Everything I’m Not LyricsYeah...
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Like that and like this and like that and uh
Like this, like this, yeah
Lamp city crew
This and uh, like that and like this and like that and uh
Like this and like that and like this and uh
Just chill

[Verse 1]
Walkin' down the street and I can feel the cold hittin' my face
Walkin' by a pretty girl and I just smile and wave
Man things are good they could probably be better
I haven't seen my mom in weeks so I guess its whatever
I think she doing good, I put my hands in my pockets
Cus im a shy mother fucker on the mic I just rock it
And get the fuck out
In high school I couldn't wait to get the fuck out
Now I'm graduating and I look at life like what now
I guess I just gotta just enjoy this shit while I'm in the moment
And just own it like the people at jersey shore on cologne
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired
That when I wake up tomorrow man I swear I'm gone get hired
Yo, rest in peace to the old me its so cliché I know it
But I guess I can't control it like pubescents and emotions
Was never one for bein' up front
I tried to write some deep shit and I hate it then start over from page one
So until then man this is all I got
An honest representation of everything I'm not
I'm not a definition my truth is in my song
So if you feel it mother fucker then just help me sing along
[Hook]
I'm not this and not that and not this and uh
I'm not that I'm not this I'm not that and uh
I'm not this I'm not that I'm not this and uh
I just chill...

[Verse 2]
Yo, I remember the days where I was like this shit gone last forever
It seems like yesterday I guess it could've been never
I got the memories, nostalgia and I'm tamed
But I'm goin insane cus too much rap music is clutterin' my brain
Right now man I'm just chillin' at whole foods writin' concepts
I eat organic cus these other rappers processed
And I, gotta let myself relax a bit
The green tea brewing I slow down and Lexie roll a spliff
And yo its cool to see my brothers growin' up in front of me
Even though I am the youngest sometimes I feel like im a hundred b
The things ive seen gone last too many lifetimes
And if I ever die at least you can remember me in my rhymes
Wanna lay in a field with the one that got away
That's this pretty girl from my hometown whose name I shouldn't say
But yo, she gonna hear this and I know you got that girl too
So don't do what I do and just, be you
Until then this is all I got
An honest representation of everything I'm not
I'm not a definition, my truth is in my songs
So if you feel it mother fucker then just help me sing along

I'm not that I'm not this I'm not that and uh
