Think Lyrics[Intro: Jessame]
One thing you showed me
Isn't she lovely
I guess she'll never know (she'll never know)
If I never get a chance to let it show

[Chorus: Jessame]
I've been thinking what do I say?
I've been thinkin' but I just don't know
Girl I'm sick of feeling this way
I got something that you need to know
I've been feelin' for a minute I can make you be my girl
I just wanna take the time to let you know
[Breakdown: TV Noise]

[Verse 2: Jessame]
Girl you're takin over my brain
And I know you feel the same way
Am I on your mind? (am I on your mind?)
I should tell her but I won't
She'll never get enough
Tell me now, let it out
Show me what you want cause

[Chorus: Jessame]
I've been thinking what do I say?
I've been thinkin' but I just don't know
Girl I'm sick of feeling this way
I got something that you need to know
I've been feelin' for a minute I can make you be my girl
I just wanna take the time to let you know

[Breakdown: TV Noise]

[Interlude: Jessame]
She was walking by
When it caught my eye
Mesmerized
I was mesmerized

One thing you showed me
Isn't she lovely
I guess she'll never know (she'll never know)
If I never get a chance to let it show

[Chorus: Jessame]
I've been thinking what do I say?
I've been thinkin' but I just don't know
Girl I'm sick of feeling this way
I got something that you need to know
I've been feelin' for a minute I can make you be my girl
I just wanna take the time to let you know

[Outro: Jessame]
I been thinking what do I say?
I've been thinkin' but I just don't know1Embed
