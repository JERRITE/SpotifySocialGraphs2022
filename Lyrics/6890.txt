Summer Nights Lyrics[DANNY]
Summer lovin', had me a blast

[SANDY]
Summer lovin', happened so fast

[DANNY]
I met a girl crazy for me

[SANDY]
Met a boy cute as can be
[DANNY & SANDY]
Summer days drifting away
To, uh oh, those summer nights

[T-BIRDS]
Well-a, well-a, well-a, uh
Tell me more, tell me more

[DOODY]
Did you get very far?

[PINK LADIES]
Tell me more, tell me more

[MARTY]
Like does he have a car?

[PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS]
Ah-ha / doo-do
Ah-ha / doo-do
Ah-ha / doo-do, doo-doo-doo

[DANNY (PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS)]
She swam by me, she got a cramp (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

[SANDY (PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS)]
He ran by me, got my suit damp (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

I saved her life, she nearly drowned (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha / doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-doo-doo)

[SANDY (T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES)]
He showed off splashing around (Doo-ba-ba-ba, doo-ba-ba-ba)

[DANNY & SANDY]
Summer sun, something's begun
But, uh oh, those summer nights

[T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES]
Well-a, well-a, well-a, uh

[PINK LADIES]
Tell me more, tell me more

[FRENCHY]
Was it love at first sight?

[T-BIRDS]
Tell me more, tell me more

[KENICKIE]
Did she put up a fight?

[PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS]
Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo  / Uh-huh, uh-huh
Doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, Uhhh-huh
Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo  / Uh-huh, uh-huh
Doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, Uhhh-huh
[DANNY (PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS)]
Took her bowling in the arcade (Down doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)

[SANDY (PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS)]
We went strolling, drank lemonade (Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)

[DANNY (PINK LADIES / T-BIRDS)]
We made out under the dock (Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie doobie doobie-down / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uhhh-huh)

[SANDY (T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES)]
We stayed out till ten o'clock (Doo-ra-ra, doo-ra-ra, doo-ra-ra)

[DANNY & SANDY]
Summer fling don't mean a thing
But, uh oh, those summer nights

[T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES]
Woah, woah, woah

[T-BIRDS]
Tell me more, tell me more

He got friendly holding my hand (Shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop)

[DANNY (T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES)]
Well, she got friendly down in the sand (Shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop, shooda-bop bop)

Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But, uh oh, those summer nights

[JAN]
How much dough did he spend?

[T-BIRDS]
Tell me more, tell me more

[SONNY]
Could she get me a friend?

[SANDY]
It turned colder, that's where it ends

[DANNY]
So I told her we'd still be friends

[SANDY]
Then we made our true love vow

[DANNY]
Wonder what she's doin' now

[DANNY & SANDY]
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
But, oh, those summer nights

[T-BIRDS & PINK LADIES]
Tell me more, tell me more11Embed
