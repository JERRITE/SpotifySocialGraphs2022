End of It Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's cruel you know
The way they've been treating you lately
Get you real messed up on the daily
They tell you things you want to hear they say, well
Honey, lover, what would I do without you?
But at the end of the day it's a game
So many mouths and they're moving the same way

[Chorus]
But you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast, I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it, I'm not at the end of it
[Verse 2]
It's what you give that's got me locked up feeling hazy
I cut all the lines but it's crazy
So I say what I, what I always say like
Is it what you want? Is it what you need?
Is there something else you needed from me?
Try to take a collar to a dog with no owner
Tell him sit, lay down, roll over it's strange

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm caught up, I'm lost in the game
I move while they beg me to stay
And I've been feeling broke up since I woke up but it's a new day
When I say what I needed, needed to say

[Chorus]
And you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it, I'm not at the end of it

[Bridge]
Tides turn as bridges burn, there's a road being cut through the thick
You hate me, you love me, your friends want to cut me
But it's all the same, ain't it?
You might also like[Chorus]
It's the same way and you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it, I'm not at the end of it

It's the same way but you know where it goes
She's been moving so fast I've been taking it slow and
Change is the funniest thing but see
I'm not at the end of it, I'm not at the end of it

[Outro]
No, no
I'm not at the end of it
No, no
I'm not at the end of it8Embed
