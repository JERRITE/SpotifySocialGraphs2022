Have We Met Before Lyrics[Verse 1]
You sat down right at the corner of my table
I don't know what it is but swear I'm feeling deja vu
Black cup of coffee and a book you're skimming over
You're a stranger but feel closer and when I'm lookin' at you

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I feel you in my memory
I think I've seen you in my dreams
Maybe you and I have history
But I don't think you know me
[Chorus]
Have we met before?
Maybe in another life I knew you
Maybe if I try I'll see right through you
And I'll remember who we were
Have we met before?
Maybe in another time I loved you
Maybe you're the one that I would run to
I don't know why it's all a blur
I think I know you (I think I know you)

[Verse 2]
I sat down right at the corner of your table
For some reason I thought maybe we had been right here before
Can't concentrate, I just keep reading the same pages
And I don't know how to say it but I wanna know you more

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I feel you in my memory
I think I've seen you in my dreams
Maybe you and I have history
But I don't think you know me

[Chorus]
Have we met before?
Maybe in another life I knew you
Maybe if I try I'll see right through you
And I'll remember who we were
Have we met before?
Maybe in another time I loved you
Maybe you're the one that I would run to
I don't know why its all a blur
I think I know you (I think I know you)
You might also like[Outro]
Yeah, yeah (I think I know you)
I think I know you (Oh, oh)1Embed
