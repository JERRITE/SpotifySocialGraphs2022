Mr aye okay, okay
Still tryna dodge a case
Still out here cookin yay
Still love droppin shake
Culinary art school
All i do is cook some shake (ugh)
Put them diamonds in they face
Im a walkin fed case
Play with bricks everyday
Trappin at the 5 way
Still got that jake the flake
House by the damn lake
Rollie with the red face
Took a bag to the face
Call that shit a great escape
SS on them roller skate
Brick made my life real estate
Had to cook it in his face
Had to cook it in his face
Took them racks and hit the safe
Save that shit for rainy day
Call me Madden, makin play
Slam dunk, 2K

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Aye aye aye damn , aye aye aye okay
Aye damn aye okay, aye aye ayeeeee
Aye aye aye damn , aye aye aye young juice
Aye damn aye okay
Aye aye ayeeeeee
