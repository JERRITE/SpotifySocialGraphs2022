Two Magpies Lyrics[Chorus]
I saw two magpies
A girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
With no salutes, I move away
And long to face, face, face
Face down fear, ooh

[Chorus]
I saw two magpies
There was a girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
Content to cry, no more to lie
I move away
And lie in truth, cha
[Chorus]
Look, two magpies
Ooh, a girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for a girl and four for a boy
I saw two magpies
Two for joy

[Outro]
Content to cry
No more to lie
In truth with you
To face down fear
Content to cry
No more to lie
No more to lie
And face down fear
