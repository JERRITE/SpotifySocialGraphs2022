Something About Your Smile LyricsBoy when I?m around you I get weak
My heart starts pumpin? a crazy beat
Words in my mouth but I can't speak
Baby I can't breathe with you next to me
Got?a check my lungs see if they still work
Got?a check my heart underneath my shirt
I think I?m in love
Theres something about your smile

From the hat to the kicks I?m matching
All day everyday girl I ain?t acting
I come across like I ain?t got manners
But somehow all these girls I?m attracting
She said its something about you
I said naar it?s the whip that got you
Then why does it feel like I need you
Oh that?s normal I does this babes
I got stong girls getting weak these days
Private calling on my phone up late
I ain't tryna got none of the laces
But me I?m a sly one ill move to your mate
I ain?t tryna spend all ight and the next day
I?ll move in the morning? be gone by eight
For some reason this girl still likes me
And I know ?cause she keeps tellin? me
Boy when I?m around you I get weak
My heart starts pumpin? a crazy beat
Words in my mouth but I can't speak
Baby I can't breathe with you next to me
Got?a check my lungs see if they still work
Got?a check my heart underneath my shirt
I think I?m in love
Theres something about your smile

Just a little something something (She said theres)
Just a little something something (She tried to tell me that theres)
Just a little something something
Theres something about your smile
About your smile

Ok maybe it?s the smile on my face but
I think your in love with my name tag
You see me though I?m humble I don?t brag
But its bait that my garms been whipped by girls
Tryna get me to the next step
I?m like slow it down we ain't even met yet
Shes like how did you get me to go that
Oh that normal I does this babes
I?m still shining without no necklace
On the block all day like I?m pumping weight
But trust me there ain't no bench press
You might also likeAlready had three of your friends two more left
I?m a flat I?m active I can't rest
You ain't met anyone like me not yet

For some reason this girl still likes me
And I know ?cause she keeps tellin? me
Boy when I?m around you I get weak
My heart starts pumpin? a crazy beat
Words in my mouth but I can't speak
Baby I can't breathe with you next to me
Got?a check my lungs see if they still work
Got?a check my heart underneath my shirt
I think I?m in love
Theres something about your smile

Just a little something something (She said theres)
Just a little something something (She tried to tell me that theres)
Just a little something something
Theres something about your smile
About your smile

Naar rudegirl I ain't gonna buy that
?Cause I know that its more than a smile on my face that
Got you all hooked up
Acting like you was the
And I was the
I got girl getting down in my hatchback
That?s why im like G don?t touch that
Shes like how did you get me to do that
Oh that?s normal I does this babes
I got strong girls getting weak these days
Private callin? on my phone up late
I?m like I ain't never gonna hold back
I?m drawn I?m a dealer
Don?t bring your friend round me I?m a sceamer
I?m a pimp bad I?m a cheater
For some reason this girl still likes me
And I know ?cause she keeps tellin? me
Boy when I?m around you I get weak
My heart starts pumpin? a crazy beat
Words in my mouth but I can't speak
Baby I can't breathe with you next to me
Got?a check my lungs see if they still work
Got?a check my heart underneath my shirt
I think I?m in love
Theres something about your smile
About your smileEmbed
