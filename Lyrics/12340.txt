Take Your Best Shot LyricsBarney: "I love you, you love me, we're a hap- ..."
(Four gunshots)
Little girl: "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

"What do you wanna do with your life?"

Go on and take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!
Blow them away! Blow them away!

I don't know why
And, lately, I don't understand why the world's so blind
And no one seems to give a damn
Don't let them say that you can't be the things that you want
Don't believe them
You've got to take your best shot
Blow them away! Blow them away!
Take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!

I don't know why everything's not OK
Try before you die 'cause that just might be today

Don't let them say that you can't be the things that you want
Just believe in yourself
And take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!
Take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!

"What do you wanna do with your life?"
This is your life
"What do you wanna do with your life?"
What do you gonna do?!
"What do you wanna do with your life?"

Don't let them say that you can't be the things that you want
Just believe in yourself
And take your best shot
Blow them away! Blow them away!
Take your best shot!
Blow them away! Blow them away!
