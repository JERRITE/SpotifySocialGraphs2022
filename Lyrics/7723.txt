Dance With Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
Break your happy home
Learn to sing along
To the music, to the music
Clap your hands and shake
On a summer's day
To the music, to the music

[Chorus]
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance
[Bridge]
I'm gonna dance with somebody

[Verse 2]
When you're all alone
We become your home
We're the music, we're the music
When your love's away
And you feel betrayed
We're the music, sweet music

[Chorus]
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance
I'm falling in love with your favourite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance (dance), dance (dance), dance (dance)
Dance (dance), dance (dance), dance (dance)
Dance (dance), dance (dance), dance (dance)
Dance (dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)
