Crash and Burn Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that people change
But I thought that we would stay the same
In a web of your lies
Didn't give me a good reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
A stupid fight
Set us alight

[Chorus]
Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You never learn
I don't know how to fake it
When we're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn
[Verse 2]
You picked him over me
And you left with no apology
Felt a knife in your back
Yeah, you thought I was the killer
You're lookin' in the mirror

[Chorus]
Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You nevеr learn
I don't know how to fake it
When wе're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Toxic games you play
Too high price to pay
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Nothing's permanent so
Guess I gotta learn to let go
You might also like[Chorus]
Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You never learn
I don't know how to fake it
When we're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn8Embed
