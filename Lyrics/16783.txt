Donâ€™t Look Any Further Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
Someone to count on in a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you standing
What you need is a lover, a man to take over
Oh, girl, don't look any further

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards & Siedah Garrett]
Strange when you think of the chances
That we've both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless, looking for the right thing
Oh, baby, don't look any further
[Pre-Chorus: Garrett & Edwards, both]
(Tonight) Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
(Rocking all night long) Rocking all night long
(Daylight) Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on (Go on and on and on)

[Chorus]
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o (Yeah)
Don't look any further (Don't you look no further)
Day o umba day o nam bu ji ay o (Yeah)
Don't look any further

[Verse 3: Edwards & Garrett, both]
Someone to count on (Someone to count on)
In a world ever changing (Mmm-hmm...)
Here I am, stop where you standing, baby
What you need is a lover (You need a lover)
To love you all over (Love you all over)
Oh baby, don't you look any further, further

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards & Siedah Garrett]
Don't look any further
Don't look any further

[Pre-Chorus: Garrett & Edwards, both]
(Tonight) Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
(Rock you all night long) Won't you rock me all night long
(Daylight) Daylight, I'll still be looking in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on and on

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o (Say it)

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o (No)
Don't look any further, further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further, further
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o yaeh
