Beautiful & Brutal Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know what, I don't know what
I don't know what's happening
I swallow the pain, drink in your poison
Darling, it hurts so sweet
I try to run, try to run
But I come back again
I look in your eyes, don't have a choice, yeah
You'll be the death of me

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's nowhere that I'd rather be
[Chorus]
It'll cut you deep
It'll watch you bleed
Nothing hits as hard as when we touch
How beautiful and brutal is your love?
Scream your heart right out
It'll throw you down and lift you up
How beautiful and brutal is your love?

[Verse 2]
Oh, couldn't they, couldn't they
Give me some warning?
Hit like a wave, head underwater
Whenever you look that way
The higher we're going
The harder we're falling
Wrapped in your chains, heavenly torture
And you know I wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'd have it no other way

[Chorus]
It'll cut you deep
It'll watch you bleed
Nothing hits as hard as when we touch
How beautiful and brutal is your love?
Scream your heart right out
It'll throw you down and lift you up
How beautiful and brutal is your love?

Yeah, yeah
Said no, no, no (No, no, no)
Said no, no, no (No, no, no)
Said no, no, no (No, no, no)
Said no, no, no (No, no, no)
No, no, no, no
No, I don't want, no any other
Don't care how hard I gotta suffer
I'm waking in your covers
I don't want up, I don't want
No, I don't want, no any other
Don't care how hard I gotta suffer
I'm waking in your covers
Beautiful and brutal

[Chorus]
Cut you deep
It'll watch you bleed
Nothing hits as hard as when we touch
How beautiful and brutal is your love?Embed
