Honey Slider LyricsWhy would you just stand there and watch me leave
You always watch me leave
You swore you'd stick around and have a dance with me
You never dance with me
Won't you please be my little honey slider
I'll leave you out to dry, I'll leave you out on the wire
Why would you get up and walk out on me
You always walk on me
You swore you'd stick around and have a drink with me
You never drink on me
Won't you please be my little honey slider
I'll leave you out to dry, I'll leave you out on the wire
At the very least
I'm gonna find you
My sweet Therese
Won't you please be my little honey slider
I'll leave you out to dry, I'll leave you out on the wireYou might also likeEmbed
