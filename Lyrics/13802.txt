Dontcha Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can be your fantasy
While you're dancin' alone tonight, yeah
Or you can be my majesty
Got me runnin' for you

[Verse 2]
Said we ain't got to take it slow
Here's what you do to me, yeah
I think it's time to take control
Girl, I just want to love you
[Pre-Chorus]
Bad that you want to give it
I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it
But at least I know the truth
The way you move around me
There's somethin' seductive to it
Got a place we can go if you're down
Let's go all the way

[Chorus]
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you
(I gotta getcha)
'Cause I just wanna vibe with you
(Let's find someplace to go)
'Cause I just gotta know if you want me too
(Dontcha want me? Yeah)
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you
(I gotta getcha)
'Cause I just wanna vibe with you
(Let's find someplace to go)
'Cause I just gotta know if you want me too
(Dontcha want me? Yeah)

Swimmin' through your galaxy
Starstruck on all of you, yeah
Perfect love analogy
That's how I describe you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad that you want to give it
I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it
But at least I know the truth
The way you move around me
There's somethin' seductive to it
Got a place we can go if you're down
Let's go all the way

[Chorus]
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you
(I gotta getcha)
'Cause I just wanna vibe with you
(Let's find someplace to go)
'Cause I just gotta know if you want me too
(Dontcha want me? Yeah)
('Cause basically I)
I just wanna ride with you
(I gotta getcha)
'Cause I just wanna vibe with you
(Let's find someplace to go)
'Cause I just gotta know if you want me too
(Dontcha want me? Yeah)
