Good To Ya Lyrics[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla sign
Ah, na-na-na-na-naa
Oh-ohh
Ooh, yeah
Oh-ohh, yeah

[Verse 1: King Combs]
Yeah, yo
I done been around the world but ain't no city like mine
Took a trip out of town with Lil Vee and Kai
Met a pretty brown-skin, said she from NY
Me and shorty do-or-die, we been twistin' a lot
She never been to Shanghai, well I got a surprise
If you like what you hear we could leave tonight
Fly straight out of the country on a red-eye
Pick you up in the Wraith, ain't no Jedi
And on my TL I see you like I'm Left Eye
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas chest out
I brought you, I ain't worried 'bout the rest out
The only question that I asked, "Am I next up?"
And is it good to you?
[Chorus: King Combs & Ty Dolla $ign]
Is it good to you? (Good)
Little shorty, is it good to you? Haha (Good)
Tell me, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Little baby, is it good to you? What, what? (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, is it good to you?
Is it good to you? (Is it good?)
Tell me, is it good to you? (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Is it good to you? (Is it good?)

[Verse 2: King Combs]
Yeah
Take a trip to Miami, hit up Khaled and French
Versace mansion for the week, CYN, we there
Do LIV on a church day, just birthday
Hit your pussy in the worst way, it's a murk day
I been ballin' like a dog, said her name is Zo
Jet skis all day, is it wet like the ocean?
How it look, how it taste, do you feel what I feel?
Gucci slippers on the yacht, I'm just keepin' it real
Have you ever been to Cali fucking high in the hills?
Kickin' shit with my pops, I'm a legend like Will
Biggie said birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
But is it good to you?

Is it good to you?
Little shorty, is it good to you? Haha (Ahh-ahh)
Tell me, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Little baby, is it good to you? What, what? (Is it good, baby?)
Baby, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Tell me, is it good to you? (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Is it good to you? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: King Combs & Ty Dolla $ign]
Double R on the truck
I pull up, fuck it up (Skrrt-skrrt)
Can't break this trust
Cover you in the VVs
Wish they was us (Oh)
But they can't keep up
Girl, that ass looks so fat
When you throw that shit back
And I know that it's all for me (All for me)
So good to me (Ooh, yeah)
Yeah, it's good to me, yeah (*Yeah*)
They say Cali girls bougie and bad, feet on the gas
Like 'em mad, ghetto with class, titties and ass
Chanel bags, but you overrated
Come fuck with the winners 'cause the rest hate it
But is it good to you? (Is it good?)
[Chorus: King Combs & Ty Dolla $ign]
Is it good to you?
Little shorty, is it good to you? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Little baby, is it good to you? What, what? (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, is it good to you?
Is it good to you?
Tell me, is it good to you? (Let me know)
Yeah, is it good to you?
Is it good to you? (Ohh-ohh)
Is it good to you? (Yeah, yeah)2Embed
