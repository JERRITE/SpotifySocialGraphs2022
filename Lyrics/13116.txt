When Morning Comes LyricsWinter turns to spring and I get tired, but I never wanted to fall asleep on you
Night turns into day and I lie awake
Anticipation and vain determination

I've been waiting for you for far too long

And every time you go i feel a pain
You walk out that door, leave my heart on the floor
And I feel like this is happening the same
I can’t speak for myself when the words feel like hell because
I've been waiting for you for far too long
And I'm always wishing you good luck when you’re gone
And I keep trying to fit in with you where I don’t belong
And I have dreams of how I wish you were
You put your arm around me and tell me that you’re happy
So until then I won’t tell you what’s wrong
I’ll be fine tomorrow but for tonight please don’t go
I've been waiting for you for far too long
And I'm always wishing you good luck when you’re gone
And I keep trying to fit in with you where I don’t belong

My heart’s sinking, you’ve been drinking, my tears will be dry when morning comes
My heart’s sinking, you’ve been drinking, I can close my eyes when morning comesYou might also likeEmbed
