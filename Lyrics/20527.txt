Losing My Mind (Mandal & Forbes Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Open up my shallow mind
Take a breath to realign
These thoughts that I just didn't choose
Well maybe that goes for you
I check before I settle in
And though you're back to missin' him
I watch before I fall again
And now I know this is the end

[Chorus]
She said I'm losing my mind
I said I'm losing my friends
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart
She said I'm losing my mind
I said I'm losing my friends
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

[Post-Chorus]
She said I'm losing my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
She said I'm losing my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

[Verse 2]
I've been looking for the answer
But I just can't break through
And you can't take no for an answer
Is this what we've come to?
And I've wasted my trust
All the time that I've lost
Trying to find what's wrong with me
You'll know where I'll be
Chasing my heart
Back to the start

[Chorus]
She said I'm losing my mind
I said I'm losing my friends
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart
She said I'm losing my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
She said I'm losing my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

[Chorus]
She said I'm losing my mind
I said I'm losing my friends
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heart

I said I'm losing my friends
I've got a lot to learn
I've got a lot to mend
And I'll keep chasing my heart
Back to the start
Maybe I'll find my whole new heartEmbed
