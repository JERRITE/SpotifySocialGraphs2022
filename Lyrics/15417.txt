Flash Burns from Flashbacks Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never knew if I should ask you
I never thought the time was right
He's the proof, the untouched ruse
A courtroom sketch of lifeless eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
The constant need to disassemble
The soft veneer that holds his reins

[Chorus]
I think I’m comin' undone
He bought the gavel to run
All the crooked, little cities
[Verse 2]
Will the starlets guard their drinks now?
Forty winks 'til slumberland
Push the hoax and drill the script
Teleprompter or polygraph?

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll try to erase it
But your faith has sеt the trap

[Chorus]
I think I'm comin' undone
He bought thе gavel to run
All the crooked, little cities

[Verse 3]
The burning film in your projector
Ulcerous amnesia
Memories, they're not so fond of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But I will erase you
Flash burns from flashbacks

[Chorus]
I think I'm comin' undone
He bought the gavel to run
All the crooked, little cities
You might also like[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I think I'm comin' undone
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I think I’m comin’ undone
I think I'm comin’ undone
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I think I'm comin' undone
I think I'm comin’ undone
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I think I'm comin' undoneEmbed
