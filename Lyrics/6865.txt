Be Myself Lyrics[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
Where do I start?
All these thoughts inside my head collide
And I decide I'm stayin' in tonight
They say, "Follow your heart"
But it's beating uncontrollably
I can't hear what it's tellin' me this time

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron]
We're dancin' on the edge of anxiety's ledge
And I might fall again, I might fall
We're walkin' on a rope of worry, and I hope
That I don't fall again, I don't fall
[Chorus: Jack Avery]
Take me somewhere I can be
I can be myself (Be myself)
Oh, take me somewhere I am free
Free to be myself and nothin' else

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais & Daniel Seavey]
I've never had pride
For myself and I'm proud of that
'Cause I know that I'm just somebody else
So why do I try? (Why do I try?)
Try to find my validation in what everybody's sayin'
I need some help

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron]
We're dancin' on the edge of anxiety's ledge
And I might fall again, I might fall
We're walkin' on a rope of worry, and I hope
That I don't fall again, I don't fall

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
Take me somewhere I can be
I can be myself
Oh, take me somewhere I am free
Free to be myself and nothin' else

We're dancin' on the edge of anxiety's ledge
And I might fall again, I might fall86Embed
