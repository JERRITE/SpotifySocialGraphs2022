SADE IN THE 90s Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, ah yeah, ah
Ah yeah, ah
Ahh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You can find me at my best when I'm naked
When I'm lyin' by the pool gettin' faded
See, I used to give a fuck, now I'm jaded
I'm allergic to the bullshit (Allergic to the bullshit)
[Pre-Chorus]
Alright, orange soda, Deepak Chopra
Versace robe and my Gucci loafer
Sex on the sofa, that's my yoga
'Til my last breath, no regrets 'cause I

[Chorus]
Do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keep spending decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blinding
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade in the 90s
Do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keep spendin' decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blinding
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade in the 90s

[Verse 2]
You can clearly see my vibe is tremendous
But you won't see through the tints in my Tesla
I be blockin' out the world, it's a mess, yeah
I'm allergic to the bullshit (Allergic to the bullshit)

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright, orange soda (Yeah), Deepak Chopra (Yeah)
Versace robe and my Gucci loafer
Sex on the sofa, that's my yoga
'Til my last breath, no regrets 'cause I

Do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keep spending decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blindin'
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade in the 90s
Do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keeping spending decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blindin'
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade in the 90s

[Bridge]
No trouble ever stayed long enough
Thank God everyday for my come-up
Somebody tryna slight me, it's all love, it's all love

[Chorus]
When I do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keep spending decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blinding
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade
Do it like it's roulette, roll it, burn it, lose it
Hit that black and red, keep spending decks, I keep it moving
Put that shit behind me, keep my diamonds blinding
Gotta keep it suave like I'm Sade in the 90s
[Outro]
Do it like it's (Do it like it's, do it like it's)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah-e-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah3Embed
