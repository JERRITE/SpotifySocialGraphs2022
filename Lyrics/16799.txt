Just a Ghost Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lost you in the summer
Before the lake got cold
You found another lover
Before the leaves turned gold
The days are getting darker
The wind begins to blow
I lost you in the summer
Like angels in the snow

[Chorus]
When the sun sets and the night falls
Shadows dance across the walls
We come to life and I pull you close
Even if you're just a ghost
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Even if you're just a ghost
[Post-Chorus]
Evеn if you're just a ghost

[Verse 2]
I lost you in the summer
Bеfore the lake got cold
But I can still remember
The dunes before they froze
There's a light across the water
But I know that you're not home
I lost you in the summer
But I never let you go

[Chorus]
When the sun sets and the night falls
Shadows dance across the walls
We come to life and I pull you close
Even if you're just a ghost
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Even if you're just a ghost

[Bridge]
Baby, I don't think I'm seeing things
To me, you're not a ghost
Baby, I don't think I'm seeing things
To me, you're not a ghost
You might also like[Chorus]
When the sun sets and the night falls
Shadows dance across the walls
We come to life and I pull you close
Even if you're just a ghost
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Just a ghost to me
Even if you're just a ghost

[Post-Chorus]
Even if you're just a ghost
Even if you're just a ghost

[Outro]
Baby, I don't think I'm seeing things
To me, you're not a ghost
Baby, I don't think I'm seeing things
To me, you're not a ghost1Embed
