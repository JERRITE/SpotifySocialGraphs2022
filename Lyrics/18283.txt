Mutha Magick Lyrics[Intro: bbymutha]
Yeah
Bitch

[Verse: bbymutha]
You ain't never had a angel on your shoulders tellin' you you gettin' older
You too old for that, devil like, "You too cold for that", booty so fat
D-D-D-D-Doja, he want cat, but I want closure
Boy, it's over, fuck it, finito, I hopped out the whip in my freak clothes
You can't flex on me with them freak hoes, I rock Vivienne, you fuck pink hoes
I say what I want and that's what I mean and they say I'm mean, but oh well
These niggas still gon' ring on my bell, my phone, my line, I don’t got the time
It's late, my flight is boardin' at nine, fine like wine, she like how I drip
I'm busty, lusty, and bloody, my pussy heavy, I limp
I put yo' baby in a corner, I'm a bully, a pimp
I'm sick of niggas, lay 'em off like he applied for a temp
I like 'em seasoned and seasonal, make 'em work like it's regionals, yeah
I don't want a nigga who don't listen to his bitch, m'kay
I'm not finna fuck up my pH, that nigga stank, m'kay
I don't know why bitches think they fuckin' with me anyway
I'm so fuckin' nice, I'll say it twice, I'm fuckin' nice
I'm nice as fuck, I'm nice as shit, waist is tiny, ass is thick
Masculine but so feminine, miss lady be droppin' dick
I'm— I'm nice as fuck, I'm nice as shit, waist is tiny, ass is thick
Masculine but so feminine, miss lady be droppin' dick (Droppin' dick)You might also likeEmbed
