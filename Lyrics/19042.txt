TranslationsEspa√±olSerial Killer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Coke
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

[Post-Chorus]
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

[Verse 2]
My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Coke
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush (rush, rush)

[Post-Chorus]
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
Do it for the thrill of it all
Love you just a little too much, much
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

[Bridge]
Just have fun
Wanna play you like a Gameboy
I don't want one
Lost the thrill of the same toy?
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Just have fun
Wanna play you like a Gameboy
I don't want one
Lost the thrill of the same toy?
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Oh!
[Breakdown]
You can see me drinking Cherry Coke
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

[Outro]
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
Do it for the thrill of it all
Love you just a little too much, much
You send me right to heaven
Sweet serial killer
I guess I'll see you never
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much73Embed
