Another Lifetime Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hope you find your way
Sorry we couldn't make it
Still, I miss you anyway, yeah
I just grew and couldn't break it

[Pre-Chorus]
How I wish perfect was enough
For my own heart
Sometimes I swear it was enough
For my own heart
[Chorus]
I guess I'll wait another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh)
Meet us in another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess I'll wait another lifetime (ooh, ooh)
'Cause there I will stay, my darling
I swear I won't run from you

[Verse 2]
I know how to make mistakes
Wasn't grown enough to fake them
Everybody makes mistakes
Do we live and learn to brave them?

[Pre-Chorus]
How I wish I was good enough
For our own heart
Don't ever think you weren't enough
For our own heart

[Chorus]
I guess I'll wait another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh)
Meet us in another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess I'll wait another lifetime (ooh, ooh)
'Cause there I will stay, my darling
I swear I won't run from you
You might also like[Bridge]
I swear I won't run
Won't run from you, I swear about it
I swear I won't run
In another life, I'll keep us bounded
Oh no, I swear I won't run
Won't run from you, I swear about it
I swear I won't run, run

[Chorus]
I guess I'll wait another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh)
Meet me in another lifetime, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess I'll wait another lifetime (ooh, ooh)
'Cause there I will stay, my darling
I swear I won't run from you9Embed
