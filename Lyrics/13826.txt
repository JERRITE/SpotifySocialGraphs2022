NORTHSIDE Lyrics[Intro]
Bruv, that shubz is gonna be intergalactic (Yeah, uh-huh)
Did you see me?
Do you have keys on? (What you fucking talking 'bout, Willis?)
Huh? Do I have keys?
You fucking stupid ho

[Chorus]
'Cause I know the Northside is looking out for me
Wanted to cry but there's nothing that made me
Going in circles, I thought that I was really finished
Got so high, well, I stopped fucking with it (Dem ones)
[Verse 1]
Peace, Earth, you don't say?
Can you tell what model they
Used to explain this oil change?
Don't praise that they're all pre-made
You fly to hold your name in the same city
I remember when you packed bags at Sainsbury's

[Refrain]
Put your loving on me 'cause I caused your best
Fight me 'til you're humming, seems like I called your stress
Wouldn't say no, bae, I caused your
Push your doubt 'round, I mean
Settle for more, yeah

[Interlude]
What BPM is it?
Yeah, yeah, nah, it was one of dem ones
'Cause I was saying wagwan like I was going into someone's yard, innit
Did you see me like, "Ah, nice to meet you," like on a respectful ting?
"Where should I leave the shoes?"

[Verse 2]
Either way you complain, I start work at nine today
Understand your awful shame
I was once the same damn way
But you're fake damned and lately
I've been missing mine for taking on your safety
You might also like[Refrain]
Put your loving on me 'cause I caused your best
Fight me 'til you're humming, seems like I called your stress
Wouldn't say no, bae, I caused your
Push your doubt 'round, I mean
Settle for more, yeah, mhm, yeah

[Interlude]
When your name's Femi, blood
It's like being English and being called like, I dunno, Harry or Phillip, you know?
Not even Phillip, bruv, 'cause it's
'Cause you got all dem Phillippé tings and dat
You know what I'm saying?
What you saying?

[Chorus]
The Northside is looking out for me
Wanted to cry but there's nothing that made me
Going in circles, I thought that I was really finished
Got so high, well, I stopped fucking with it

[Verse 3]
'Cause you know the ninth day becomes a quiet place
The last thing I remember is the night or day
The Northside is with me, even in LA
Which one do you prefer?
Well, I can't choose, they're not the same
You're right, I might have packed too much this time
You know that I go missing, babe, not worth another fight
Can't cut me off, I won't obey, I can't lie, I wanna stay
(It's when you shouted Sainsbury's, man got a little emotional still)
[Refrain]
Put your loving on me 'cause I caused your best
Fight me 'til you're humming, seems like I called your stress
Wouldn't say no, bae, I caused your
Push your doubt 'round, I mean
Settle for more, yeah

[Interlude]
Sometimes it's about finding the magic in them tings
It's a vibe, it suits your voice bare as well
Actually sounds pretty good now
This is hard

[Chorus]
The Northside is looking out for me
Wanted to cry but there's nothing that made me
Going in circles, I thought that I was fucking finished
Got so high, well, I stopped fucking with it
The Northside is looking out for me
Wanted to cry but there's nothing that made me
Going in circles, but that won't break my spirit
Got so high, well, I stopped fucking with it

[Outro]
Yeah, man, I'm ready to hear the whole album
Honestly, you're going in6Embed
