It’s Alright, It’s OK Lyrics[Intro]
It's alright, it's okay
Don't you let your troubles get in the way
Just believe and have faith
Know that He's with you every day

[Verse 1: Shirley Caesar]
Sometimes, it's hard to say you're doing okay
When you are trying to hide the pain on your face
Times are getting harder
You've prayed and you've prayed
Just keep hoping, believing
Hold on to your faith
[Chorus + Shirley Caesar]
It's alright, it's okay
Don't you let your troubles get in the way
Just believe and have faith
Know that He's with you every day

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
There are times when you can't seem to find your way
The skies are dark, you can't feel night from day
Put a smile on your face
Keep holding on
Brighter days are coming
It won't be long

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's okay
Don't you let your troubles get in the way
Just believe and have faith
Know that He's with you every day

[Modulation]
Oh, oh it's alright
Alright
It's alright
Alright
It's alright
Alright
I know it will put a smile on your face
Alright
Dry the tears from your eyes
Alright
Lord said, it's going to be alright, alright, alright, alright
(Take it Anthony)
[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]..
I know it'll
Alright
Be alright
Alright
Say alright
Alright
Say alright
Alright
Put a smile on your face
(I'm smiling right now)
Just believe
Alright
Brighter days are coming
Alright
It's gonna be alright

[Chorus + Shirley Caesar + Anthony Hamilton]
It's alright, it's okay
Don't you let your troubles get in the way
Just believe and have faith
Know that He's with you every dayEmbed
