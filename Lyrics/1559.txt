Another minute with you Lyrics[Verse 1]
We didn't talk enough
And we fell out of love
It wasn't complicated, I just never wanted to stop
Doing what I am
And you couldn't understand
My heart was eaching just as much as yours but it doesn't wait

[Pre-Chorus]
To make up for the things I've done
To go back to where we begun
When our love was a loaded gun
And the aim was true
[Chorus]
And all I ever wanted was you
To tell me that you needed me too
When time was all we ever had to lose
I don't want it all back
I just want another minute with you

[Verse 2]
You're doing bеtter now
I see you going out
I saw a picture of you dancing, you werе wearing a smile
On that pretty face
It's kinda hard to take
I know it's selfish thinking baby but if there was a way

[Pre-Chorus]
To make up for the things I've done
To go back to where we begun
When our love was a loaded gun
And the aim was true

[Chorus]
And all I ever wanted was you
To tell me that you needed me too
When time was all we ever had to lose
I don't want it all back
I just want another minute with you
You might also like[Bridge]
I know when I speak
You talk back to me
I know that I can't keep on running back
'Cause all I ever wanted was you
To tell me that you needed me too
I hate that I'm the one who had to choose

[Outro]
And all I ever wanted was you
To tell me that you needed me too
When time was all we ever had to lose
I don't want it all back
You don't want it all back
I don't want it all back
I just want another minute with youEmbed
