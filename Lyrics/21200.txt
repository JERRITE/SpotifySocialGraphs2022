Say the Word Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah!
All bad boy weh dem want a gun inna holsters
Yeah, take this from original wicked man, Beenie Man
And tell the world say...
Have mercy
You a hear me now?
You have some little boy a gwan like dem a murderer
And when dem walk and stop kill mosquito
Original Beenie Man pon version nuh stop walk and murder all woman, and all woman insect, and all human
Mad Cocaine a champion
A wha' me tell dem say?
[Bridge]
Well, if a boy waan test I, tell him fi try
Nothing beat a trial but a failure, mi boy
If you diss the program and make mi fans cry
Anyweh the wing fi come from, grow wing and fly

[Chorus]
Unuh waan people dead-o, unuh say the word
Momma, poppa, little marrow fly like bird
Somebody goin' dead, so mark mi word
Diss Beenie Man, you know wha' God unuh deh serve

[Verse 1]
See me with mi gun, nuh think me goin' romp
Pop out mi barrel and boy get cramp
Blood all a run like Hermitage damp
'Mount of blood you bleed coulda full all a tank
Pop off mi belt, DJ get spanked
I maybe mad, but I'm not ignorant
Put on mi frock and dash 'way all pants
When me disguise, we shoot up all an ants
Pop off a stripe and put him inna low rank

[Chorus]
Unuh waan people dead-o, unuh say the word
Momma, poppa, little marrow fly like bird
Somebody goin' dead, so mark mi word
Diss Beenie Man, you know wha' God unuh deh serve

Decision
This is the assassination
Decision
Tell me if me right or wrong
Decision
Boy, you shouldn't test this veteran
Decision
You better have a funeral plan
See me with the mic and you take say you're safe
Moments after, hitch up inna glass case
Hide all your body and a expose your face
True you never see me with mi Glock pon mi waist

[Chorus]
Unuh waan people dead-o, unuh say the word
Momma, poppa, little marrow fly like bird
Somebody goin' dead, so mark mi word
Diss Beenie Man, you know wha' God unuh deh serve

[Verse 3]
Coulda Clint Eastwood or Steven Siegel
Indian, cow, or some wild animal
From mi friend, Mad Cocaine, pick up the signal
Start the nine night, a someone funeral
Black Wizard dress up and powder the dead
Doctor Cuban put two inna him head
Silver, diamond, put you dead inna the hole
See man so simple, never know man so cold
[Bridge]
Well, if a boy waan test I, tell him fi try
Nothing beat a trial like a failure, mi boy
If you diss the program and make mi fans cry
Anyweh the wing fi come from, grow dem and fly

[Chorus]
Unuh waan people dead-o, unuh say the word
Momma, poppa, little marrow fly like bird
Somebody goin' dead, so voice be heard
Diss Beenie Man, you know wha' God unuh deh serve

[Verse 1]
See me with mi gun, nuh think me goin' romp
Pop out mi barrel and boy get cramp
Blood all a run like Hermitage damp
'Mount of blood you bleed coulda full all a tank
Pop off mi belt, and boy get spanked
I maybe mad, but I'm not ignorant
Put on mi frock and dash 'way all pants
When me disguise, me shoot up all an ants
Buss off a stripe and put him inna low rank

[Chorus]
Unuh waan people dead-o, unuh say the word
Momma, poppa, little marrow fly like bird
Somebody goin' dead, so mark mi word
Diss Beenie Man, you know wha' God unuh deh serve
