California Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I stay high all the time
Just to get by
I climb into the sky
And my eyes, they cry

[Pre-Chorus]
California nights
Make me feel so happy I could die
But I try to stay alive
[Chorus]
I never wanna get so high
That I can't come back down to real life
And look you in the eyes and say
"Baby, you're mine"

[Verse 2]
Fading back and forth
I fly through my mind
I take the way I've known
But have I really grown?

[Pre-Chorus]
California nights
Make me feel so happy I could die
But I try to stay alive

[Chorus]
I never wanna get so high
That I can't come back down to real life
And look you in the eyes and say
"Baby, you're mine"

[Bridge]

[Outro]
I never wanna get so high
That I can't come back down to real life
And look you in the eyes and say
"Baby, oh, baby you're mine"You might also like4Embed
