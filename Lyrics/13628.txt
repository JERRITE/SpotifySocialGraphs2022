Into You (3LAU Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move
[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (Ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up (So, baby, come light me up), and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (A little bit dangerous), but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
So, come light me up (Yeah, into you)
Little dangerous (Yeah, into you)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Oh, whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up (Light me up), and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (Dangerous), but, baby, that's how I want it (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us (Watchin' us), so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous (Scandalous), but, baby, don't let them see it (Yeah)
A little less conversation (Yeah) and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
(I'm so into you)Embed
