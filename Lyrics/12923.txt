Turn the Table Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the background
On the dance floor
Can't look at the sky
I want to use my eyes
I feel my body
On a pedestal
I want to tell you
But now I don't know why

[Chorus]
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
[Verse 2]
In a limbo
In the lobby
Left my body
Now I'm back again
Heaven and Hell
With you, I can't tell
Every angle
Is a jagged edge

You make me so uncouth
Miss my fountain of youth
I feel my body
On a pedestal
I want to tell you
But now I don't know why

[Chorus]
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
You might also like[Bridge]
Day and night on an island
Up in flames, feels like violence
No more silence
Turn the table
You're the one who's quiet

[Chorus]
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now
Oooh, that girl (That girl)
That girl ain't afraid of you now2Embed
