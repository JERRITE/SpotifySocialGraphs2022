Better Anyway LyricsVerse:
I wish I liked the good girls
I wish that I could think less
I wish there was a way to say my feelings
Without that fuckin’ feeling
That I’m scared to be a mess
I think that I should sing more
Cause I probably never seem stressed
I still think about my ex sometimes
But my ex don’t like it
When I send that late night text
Pre Chorus
I wanna like the good girls
But there’s somethin' bout the bad
That makes you wanna interrupt her sentence
Before she even finish
Cause you’d rather (uh) instead
But you’re prolly not a good girl
Cause you don’t give a damn
That every single night’s a different city
You'll find a way to see me
So I guess you’ll understand
That

Hook:
Good girls go to heaven
Bad girls go backstage
You wish we were together
You live out of state
I gotta go in the morning
You know that I can’t stay
You know that I can’t get close
But it’s prolly better anyway
It’s prolly better anyway
It’s prolly better anyway
It’s prolly better anyway

And I can’t open up
I can’t even trust myself
Cause I just want some fun
You lookin’ for the one
Yeah, you just want my love
But I can’t give it up yet
(You just wanna fuck
I can’t get enough, yeah)

This feeling like the right place at the wrong time
Goddammit, you look so fly baby
In that skin tight
But you know I come with heartbreak
And the spotlight
And that’s why I gotta go

I guess I like the good girls
But there’s somethin’ bout the bad
That makes you feel like
Feeding this addiction
Filling a prescription
You wish you didn’t have
But baby, you’re a good girl
So I just wouldn’t fit your plans
And it seems like maybe
You’re too fuckin’ precious
And I’m too fuckin’ wreckless
To ever have that chance
Cause
Hook:
Good girls go to heaven
Bad girls go backstage
You wish we were together
I live in LA
I gotta go in the morning
You know that I can’t wait
And you know that I can’t get close
It’s prolly better anyway

I can’t, I can’t
I won’t, I won’t
I can’t, I can’t get close
I can’t, I can’t
I won’t, I won’t
I can’t get
I can’t, I can’t
I won’t, I won’t
I can’t
I can’t get close
I can’t, I can’t
I won’t, I won’t
I can’t get close, no
I can’t get close

Do, do, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, da
Ooooooh, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, da

I can’t get close
Can’t get too close
Gotta go home
It’s prolly better anyway1Embed
