Toothbrush Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo, half-hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night (Ah-woo)
Up in the mornin', uh, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat (Ah-woo)
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed-up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door? (Ah-woo)

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go here
Give me somethin' I've never known (Ah-woo)
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place (Come on), at my place

[Verse 2]
No need to question next time we meet
I know you're comin' home with me, home with me (Ah-woo)
Sweat like a sauna, uh, break out the ice
I know you're gonna stay the night, stay the night (Ah-woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed-up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door? (Ah-woo, hey)
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go here
Give me somethin' I've never known (Ah-woo, hey)
So, baby, you don't have to rush (Haha)
You could leave a toothbrush at my place (Haha, ha), at my place

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door? (Ah-woo)

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush (You don't have to rush, oh)
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush (Keep it, oh)
You could leave a toothbrush at (Hey), my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go here (No, no)
Give me somethin' I've never known (Give me somethin' I've never known, ah-woo)
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place (At my place), at my place23Embed
