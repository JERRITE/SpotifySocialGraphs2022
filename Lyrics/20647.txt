Till It Hurts Lyrics[Verse 1: Ayden]
Hold me tight, read my lips
Don’t need a word to say
Lay me down, blow my mind
Let’s take it all the way

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight?
See, we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight
[Chorus: Ayden]
Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst

[Drop: Bizzey]
(And bring on that bass)
Yellow motherfuckin claw

[Bridge: Bizzey]
If you want that real love, no fake love
That hard love until it hurts
That straight fire, no fake fight
We can’t stop until it hurts
Don’t you worry 'bout a thang, I’ma do you right
I’ma hit it in the morning like I do tonight

[Verse 2: Ayden]
Slow it down till my heart
Is ready to explode
Bring it back, go down low
As far as you can go

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight?
So we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight

Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst
