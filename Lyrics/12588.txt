Desert Snow Lyrics[Chorus]
Oooh
There's so much I wanna tell ya
Oooh
More than you could ever know
Oooh
I swear the mercury was frozen
Oooh
Walking in the desert snow

[Verse 1]
Run while you've got a head start
'Cause it's a phantom
And it never tires
You wanna run out the clock
You take the backseat
Saying "I don't care, just drive"
[Chorus]
Oooh
There's so much I wanna tell ya
Oooh
More than you could ever know
Oooh
I swear the mercury was frozen
Oooh
Walking in the desert snow

[Verse 2]
Lifted up, lifted up, lifted up
No, I don't care about any of that now
It's all been put behind
It's falling through the cracks
Lost somewhere between
Where I was and wanna be now

[Chorus]
Oooh
There's so much I wanna tell ya
Oooh
More than you could ever know
Oooh
I swear the mercury was frozen
Oooh
Walking in the desert snow
You might also like[Outro]
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
