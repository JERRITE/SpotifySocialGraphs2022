Backseat (All I Got) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't see
The girl behind the first impression
We don't get deep
'Cause you prefer the surface tension

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll go out, dress up in pastels
I'll say I feel like myself and we won't question a thing
We're skin to skin in my car
Won't bring it up in the dark like happy's all we could be
[Chorus]
Nobody breaks up in the backseat
It's another night of putting it off
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got
It's easy for you, got nothing to lose
If needing me's the last thing you'd do
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got

[Verse 2]
So, is this it?
Parking lots and our half-hearted
Conversation, I'm dangerously patient
It's fine for a while, the illusions fading

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But since we're skin to skin in my car
Won't bring it up in the dark

[Chorus]
Nobody breaks up in the backseat
It's another night of putting it off
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got
It's easy for you, got nothing to lose
If needing me's the last thing you'd do
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got

All I got (Ooh-ooh, woah-oh-oh)
All I got (Ooh-ooh, woah-oh-oh)
And I guess that's all I got
(Ooh-ooh, woah-oh-oh)
Just wanted somebody to want me
(Ooh-ooh, woah-oh-oh)
And I guess that's all I gotEmbed
