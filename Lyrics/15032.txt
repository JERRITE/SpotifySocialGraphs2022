Five Seconds Lyrics[Verse 1]
Strolling through the slaughterhouse of love
Rags and ruins and stars above
I'm as naked as I can be in this life
This labyrinth is only one straight line
Back and forth, up and down your spine
Emptiness of heaven in your ears and my eyes

[Chorus]
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!
[Post-Chorus]
You are the air that I breathe!

[Verse 2]
Sweet annihilation in your hands
Your own personal Stalingrad
I'm just a piece of archaeology in your mind
I'll be your private amusement park
Rollercoasterin' in the dark
Come and turn this nightmare upside down and let's ride

[Chorus]
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!

[Post-Chorus]
You are the air that I breathe!
You are the air that I breathe!
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
(Don't pull my nerve!)
You are the air that I breathe!
All that I need!
All that I need!

Our house is burning right before our eyes
And ain't nobody a bit surprised
You prayed for rain and I fell down all night
Love me 'till the ambulance arrives
Until I can't hear the screams and cries
And I'll be choking on my ABC's all night

[Chorus]
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five seconds to live
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds
Four and five is all I can give
One one thousand - Two one thousand - Three one thousand
Four and five seconds again
One second - Two seconds - Three seconds - Four seconds - Five seconds
Here we go!

[Post-Chorus]
You are the air that I breathe!Embed
