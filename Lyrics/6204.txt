SAD (Clap Your Hands) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Still stuck in bed
Try to remember how
Unscrew my head
That's too left brain right now
I washed my hair, I’m still a mess
I'm having trouble getting dressed
I've still got memories to repress
But I still hear my mama saying

[Chorus]
If you’re sad and you know it
And you don't want to show it
Clap your hands
If you are sad, that's okay
You can clap it all away
Just clap your hands
Clap clap your hands
Sad
We're all a little sad
[Verse 2]
It's getting hard to justify my thoughts
And where I'm coming from
Understand how I got here
How I became what I've become
They say that if I try
That I could maybe be someone
But I'm scared because I know deep down
That day may never come

[Chorus]
If you’re sad and you know it
And you don’t want to show it
Clap your hands
If you are sad, that's okay
You can clap it all away
Just clap your hands
Clap clap your hands
Sad
We’re all a little sad
Clap clap your hands
Sad
We're all a little sad

[Bridge]
Shut up and be happy
It's all in your head
Grow up and be happy 'cause it ain’t that bad
That's what my doctor says
Unless you'd rather be
Unless you'd rather be
You might also like[Chorus]
Sad and you know it
And you don't want to show it
Clap your hands
If you are sad, that's okay
You can clap it all away
Just clap your hands
Clap clap your hands
Sad
We're all a little sad
Clap clap your hands
Sad
We're all a little sad2Embed
