I Saw Stars Disappear LyricsI saw stars disappear
In the darkest hour
I remember the voices
Who were guiding me higher
And i heard people calling
To the open air
They were dancing like children
Surrounding me there
And i couldn't listen
To the sound anymore
Carrying the way on
Eyes still out of focus
I don't want to lose sight
Before it's over
I lost out too soon

I saw stars disappear
In the darkest hour
I remember the voices
Who were guiding me higher
And i heard people calling
To the open air
They were dancing like children
Surrounding me there
And i couldn't listen
To the sound anymore
Carrying the way on

Eyes still out of focus
I don't want to lose sight
Before it's over
I lost out too soon

I saw stars disappear
In the darkest hour
I remember the voices
Who were guiding me higher
And i couldn't listen
To the sound anymore
Carrying the way onYou might also likeEmbed
