All Over Now Lyrics[Intro]
Are you found?

[Verse 1]
Do you remember, remember the night?
At a hotel in London, they started to fight
She told her man that she fell on the ground
She was afraid that the truth would be found

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember?
Do you recall?
Do you remember?
I remember it all
[Chorus]
And it's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Do you remember, remember the place?
In a hotel in London, a scar on her face
She told her man that she fell on the ground
She was afraid that the truth would be found

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember
Do you recall?
Do you remember?
'Cause I remember it all

[Chorus]
And it's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now

[Chorus]
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
