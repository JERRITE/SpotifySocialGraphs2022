Swangin (Chad) Lyrics[Intro]
You send me swingin'
Oh, you send me swingin'
(David Banner)

[Verse 1]
Candy paint on a set of swingers, got a bop with me when you see me ride
Truck pop with the fifth on it, got the top missing when you see me slide
Double cup, sipping Texas tea, I'm on muddy water while I drink and drive
Comin' down in Houston, smokin' California, fuck 12 like I did a crime
Glass set pokin' out the fender
Grippin' wood like I'm choppin' timber
White seat lookin' Kylie Jenner
Your favorite bitch, look, I'm probably in her
Sunday, I'm off of Almeda in the Third Ward eatin' turkey legs
With a stall-stallion that can work a bed
With a lot of ass and some perfect head
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Baby girl ask me how I like it
H-Town 'cause I like it slow
Robert Davis if you didn't know
Somethin' like a pimp, swingin' slow
Ridin' dirty when I tip a four
Motor quiet like a tippy toe
She gon' kiss it like it's under mistletoe
Baby work the pole like a stripper pro
Starplex, you gon' put a bullet in the same place where them Clippers go
And nigga ridin' with you been a ho
Clip 'em both, put 'em in a hole
Comin' down when I'm comin' through
Catch me sippin', never trippin' though
Comin' down when I'm comin' through
Catch me sippin', never trippin' though
