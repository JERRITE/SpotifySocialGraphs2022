In My Arms LyricsHoney did I wake you?
Had that falling dream again
Fear we're going nowhere
Can we start where we began?

Couldn’t love you more, couldn't love you more
Couldn't love you more, couldn’t love you more
Can we start where we began?
Couldn't love you more, couldn't love you more
Couldn't love you more
Need to start where we began
I feel we're falling away
You got me hoping for a miracle
Give me one more day
Let me hold you in my arms, yeah
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms

Darlin' are you with me?
I hear you crying but there's no tears
Feel we're riding in the backseat
Nobody wants to take the wheel

Couldn’t love you more, couldn’t love you more
Couldn't love you more, couldn’t love you more

I feel we're falling away
You got me hoping for a miracle
Give me one more day
Let me hold you in my arms, yeah
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms

Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms

I feel we're falling away
You got me hoping for a miracle
Give me one more day
Let me hold you in my arms, yeah
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms
Let me hold you in my arms1Embed
