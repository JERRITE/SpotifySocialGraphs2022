Televisions Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I just want to hold your hand
I just want to do your dance
Like those times we used to know
On those television shows

[Verse 2]
I just want to make you cry
For all those times you made me cry
For all those times we used to know
On those television shows
[Chorus]
I'm having tele/visions
I'm having tele/visions
I'm having tele/visions
I'm having tele/visionsYou might also like6Embed
