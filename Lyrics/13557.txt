Blueberry Boats (And Pink Elephants) LyricsAs sure as the morning comes
Your head hurts, but I'm the sick one?
Slow down
You might say something harmful for me to feed on

Blueberry boats
I dream of blueberry boats
But you just see pink elephants
I dream of blueberry boats

Boy, take the hatchet from the devil
And bury it good
You've lived your life drunken with laughter
Now what good are you?You might also likeEmbed
