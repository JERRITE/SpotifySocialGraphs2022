The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I've got a secret, I cannot say
Blame modern movement to give it away
You've got something, that I understand
Hold it in tightly, call on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

[Chorus]
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
[Verse 2]
Look for reflections in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner or locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Stuck in belief, there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
We've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel

[Chorus]
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell

[Bridge]
I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm taking our song to the grave
You might also like[Chorus]
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone3Embed
