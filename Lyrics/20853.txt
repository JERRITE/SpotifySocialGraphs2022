Dancinâ€™ By Myself Lyrics[Verse 1]
So you didn't show up
My heart didn't blow up
I ain't gonna loose it all tonight
No, I'm not gon' fight it
Totally excited
Just to be here underneath the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
See, my heart is goin', "Bum-bum, di-de, di-de, pum-pum"
Like the city neva' sleeps
And my head is goin', "Bum-bum, di-de, di-de, pum-pum"
Turn it up and blast the, blast the beat!
[Chorus]
Dancin' by myself
I don't need no help
Wishin' you were here, (ah) to see me
Dancin' by myself
Got nobody else
But I don't really care, believe me

[Post-Chorus 1]
I just keep
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin' by myself
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin' by myself

[Verse 2]
Situation all good
Feet are movin' forward
Welcome, to the party in my mind
Imagination, take me
Don't you go and wake me
Leave it to the D.J. every time

[Pre-Chorus]
See, my heart is goin', "Bum-bum, di-de, di-de, pum-pum"
Like the city neva' sleeps
And my head is goin', "Bum-bum, di-de, di-de, pum-pum"
Turn it up and blast the, blast the beat!

Dancin' by myself
I don't need no help
Wishin' you were here, (ah) to see me
Dancin' by myself
Got nobody else
But I don't really care, believe me

[Bridge]
And when the night is over, I ain't gonna be sorry
No
Yeah, when the night is over, I just might still be...

[Chorus]
Dancin' by myself
I don't need no help
Wishin' you were here, (ah) to see me
Dancin' by myself
Got nobody else
But I don't really care, believe me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin' by myself
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin' by myself
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin' by myself
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'
Du-du-du-du-du-dancin'...Embed
