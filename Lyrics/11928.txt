Yeah, my diamonds really ice like a date at a skating rink
Wait, sit in my passenger side, yeah, and race with me
Wait, Midnight Club, club at midnight, leave and race with me
Yeah, I ain’t a dub, I ain’t a scrub, I'm Grey’s Anatomy
Yeah, I'm on the edge, I'm on the ledge, I'm on the balcony
I’m a king, wait, call me majesty
Wait, analogy, wait, I'm out this galaxy
Yeah, as high as I can be, wait, I can finally see
Ain't no gravity, yeah, you ain't attached to me
I just walk in buying everything, yeah, so casually
Used to work a grocery store, I got these bags on me
Ayy, like she doing chores, yeah, she gon' vacuum me
Wait, she gon' go to war, yeah, she gon' blast for me
First one in the door, yeah, and I'm the last to leave
What I'm working towards, man, why you asking me?
Watch out for them boys, yeah, they've been tracking me
I got this real money, yeah, my cash made legally
