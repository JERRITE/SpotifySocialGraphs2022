Highest in the Game Lyrics[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Shit is wild and tension's heavy
No matter what it is or what it ain't or what it can be
It's me here from uber fates and karma sent me
I roll with ESN and MNE'll represent me
I'm wide open like a half a zip and 5th of Henny
I stay choking like I'm blowing smoke that Paul sent me
Top shelf light green and it shine like jade stone
My mindset old school just like a pay phone
They're telling me to hang em up
I'm off the hook and outta touch
Fuck the world a busy signal
Tell em all get off my nuts
Cause they ain't even got the numbers
To tap in
Stay lucrative from front to the back end
Let's cash in
[Hook]
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
Peter piper picked ah player wit hot rhymes
Nickel diming was brought up on living hard times
Hey I can see my future and it's all good
Living on the block of the misunderstood (Muthafucka)
I got a feeling I'm winning... Let's take it all the way
Can't see the hate cause I'm high... and floating through the day
Memory's keep me focused so let me think back
Way before the whiplash from rock-in to a dope track
Crack a bottle, let's celebrate a brand new beginning
Been ah looser so my only focus now is winning
Staying real as it gets and I ain't never changing
Looking at what's left we coming for the takin

Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up

Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Don't be playin wit me boy this ain't a game I ain't a toy
Must I explain why I love to destroy
Look around I'm feelin the pain fillin the void
Feel like the same situation that I try to avoid
Come outta pocket Imma put a hole in ya the size of a big rock
It just shows you how I roll
I ain't losin y'all no
I rather put the gun to my head an let it go
You know every word that I said is worth the gold
That's why ya listen instead of leavin me alone
I don't give a fuck about bread I want the dough
I'm given the sweat an I bled in the microphone
Any time I'm in the zone what
[Hook]
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods

Fuck it level up

Higher than the highest
In the game never changing
Stay trying to smoke good

We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
All the way up it's the apex
Towering over all of you basics
Flying like a spaceship way past the clouds
You can tell I'm bringing hell with the fire raining down on em
Go to town on em they don't get down like this
Get ya face fixed verbal face lift
Ya counterfeit knock-off designer fits
Need to quit face it career a glitch in the matrix
Stay off my plane
Bitches still snitching for change
Hanging off nuts addicted to fame
I'm about that guap dividends that never drop
Stay the highest in the game an it's never gonna stop

[Hook]
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changing
Stay trying to smoke good
They calling us no goods
We only trying to catch up
With the name game
Fuck it level up
We are not the same man
Higher than the highest
In the game never changingEmbed
