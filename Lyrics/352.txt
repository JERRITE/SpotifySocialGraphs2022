Hell & Back Lyrics[Intro]
(DrellOnTheTrack)

[Chorus]
When I think about it, yeah, I scheme about it
Got to be about it, I don't dream about it
Got to keep movin', I ain't never stoppin'
It's so many people who behind me
Goin' hard, yeah, I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain, but, I'm steady shinnin'
I want this shit bad, no, I ain't lyin'
Do anythin' for it, no, I ain't lyin' (DrellOnTheTrack)
I been doin' this shit for a minute
Forever goin' in 'til I get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches
Got to stay on my grind, get to them riches
Time is money I ain't wastin' time
I'm feelin' like Kobe, I'm in my prime
I swear I been hurt, yeah, too many times
No, I ain't got time for all them lies
[Verse 1]
You don't know what this shit mean to me (DrellOnTheTrack)
I swear that I'm tryin', why don't you see?
Really up in that waters come swim with me
My visions so blurry can barely see
I stopped by dope boy got that OG Lenny
I pour that shit up, drink it with 3Three
That shit got me with a crazy lean
That shit got me with a crazy lean
Shorty keep askin' me when I'm comin' over (DrellOnTheTrack)
Told her that I'm gon' come when my show's over
Ridin' 'round like a rollercoaster
Got to keep it goin', got to stay in motion
Twin got me on X, I ain't losin' focus
Swear that I'm up, I don't need a floater
When I get there we gon' go all morning
When I get there we gon' go all morning (Oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
When I think about it, yeah, I scheme about it
Got to be about it, I don't dream about it
Got to keep movin', I ain't never stoppin'
It's so many people who behind me
Goin' hard, yeah, I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain, but, I'm steady shinnin'
I want this shit bad, no, I ain't lyin'
Do anythin' for it, no, I ain't lyin' (DrellOnTheTrack)
I been doin' this shit for a minute
Forever goin' in 'til I get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches
Got to stay on my grind, get to them riches
Time is money I ain't wastin' time
I'm feelin' like Kobe, I'm in my prime
I swear I been hurt, yeah, too many times
No, I ain't got time for all them lies

All this shit that I go through just make me stronger (DrellOnTheTrack)
Came out the cave, now they heard me conquer
Run up that sack promise I won't fumble
Run up that sack and take care my mama
I'm run up that sack just for my lil' brother
Bless my sister tell her, "Fuck a nigga"
Never forget who was always with me
Got to blow a bag with my niggas
Everthing that I do, I swear I elevate (DrellOnTheTrack)
Never go back, got to prosper
Bob and weave like a boxer
Drank don't make me move slow, I move faster
Keep a gun, but, I don't promote violence
Not wastin' my money on dancers
Pray for my auntie, just cause she got cancer
No money could make this better
No (DrellOnTheTrack)

[Chorus]
When I think about it, yeah, I scheme about it (Yeah)
Got to be about it, I don't dream about it
Got to keep movin', I ain't never stoppin' (Yeah)
It's so many people who behind me (Behind me)
Goin' hard, yeah, I'm steady grindin'
Full of pain, but, I'm steady shinnin' (Steady shinnin')
I want this shit bad, no, I ain't lyin' (No, I ain't lyin')
Do anythin' for it, no, I ain't lyin' (DrellOnTheTrack)
I been doin' this shit for a minute
Forever goin' in 'til I get it
Not wasting my time with all these bitches (No)
Got to stay on my grind, get to them riches (Got to stay on my grind)
Time is money I ain't wastin' time
I'm feelin' like Kobe, I'm in my prime (Yeah)
I swear I been hurt, yeah, too many times (I swear)
No, I ain't got time for all them lies (All them lies)
[Outro]
Yeah
