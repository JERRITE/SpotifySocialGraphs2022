Stop It Youâ€™re Killing Me LyricsThe world is fucked
And so am I
Maybe it's the other way 'round
I can't seem to decide
Domestic refugees
Sink in the same boat as me
We suffer alone
And these days I don't wanna go home

Idiots' authority
Promising equality
So where is the land of the free?
Stop it, you're killing me
Love is for the weak
Or so you'd have me believe
The thought's killing me
No body but a head O.D
Don't know what's worse
The loss of death or the gain of birth
I try to understand
I can't accept just what I am

Idiots' authority
Promising equality
So where is the land of the free?
Stop it, you're killing me

I'm leaving on a train
That's six miles down
Can't feel no pain
Can't feel you now
When you drift away I'm singing
"On my way, I'm telling you"
I can hear you coming to
I can see you pushing through
Tell me can you see the
Can you feel the rain?

Idiots' authority
Promising equality
So where is the land of the free?
Stop it, you're killing me
Idiots' authority
Promising equality
So where is the land of the free?
Stop it, you're killing meYou might also likeEmbed
