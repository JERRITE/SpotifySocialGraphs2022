If Only for Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
This strip mall town has got me down
A lonely populated shade of grey
And they're expecting me to stay
"A" through "Z" the blacktop streets
Repeat the patterns we’ve all seen before
It's getting harder to ignore

[Pre Chorus]
This won't be the last time I’ll be here
[Chorus]
I want to drive far away with you
I know that it's nothing new, but we feel it every time
For all my life I felt like my hands were tied
I'm dying to feel alive if only for tonight

[Verse 2]
Each time we pass the District line
And make our way along the interstate
I feel the pressure start to fade
The sun goes down, we hear the sound
Of Springsteen singing "we were born to run"
Well baby, we're still young

[Pre Chorus]
This won't be the last time I'll be here
I know that I can't outrun the fear

[Chorus]
I want to drive far away with you
I know that it's nothing new, but we feel it every time
For all my life I felt like my hands were tied
I’m dying to feel alive if only for tonight

[Bridge]
I want to drive far away with you
I know that it’s nothing new, but we feel it every time
All my life I felt like my hands were tied
I'm dying to feel alive if only for tonight
This won’t be the last time I'll be here
No this won't be the last time I'll be here
You might also like[Chorus]
I want to drive far away with you
I know that it’s nothing new, but we feel it every time
For all my life I felt like my hands were tied
I'm dying to feel alive if only for tonight1Embed
