When I Get Older Lyrics[Verse 1]
Down by the dock
Sits a man on a rock
With his hands in the air
Hear him talk, hear him swearing

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get older
I'm gonna be there to hold her
Long as I sleep through the dark and make up my mind
Just know I regret the time I let you pass by
[Chorus]
Oh, maybe there's still hope
Maybe there's still ho-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Out with my pals
Getting lost in the crowds
See the girl in her heels
Raise her glass to the ceiling

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get older
I'm gonna be there to hold her
Long as I sleep through the night and make up my mind
Just know I shook off the time I let you pass by

[Chorus]
Oh, maybe there's still hope
Maybe there's still ho-oh-oh
Oh, maybe there's still hope
Maybe there's still ho-oh-oh

[Bridge]
We wanna be like the celebrities
That we see on TV with a nice set of keys
But what I want is what you want
And we want to feel young
Somewhat mistreated, yeah
Yeah, somewhat, what, somewhat misjudged
You might also likeWhen I get older
I'm gonna be there to hold her
(Long as I sleep through the dark and make up my mind)
When I get older
I'm gonna be there to hold her
(Yeah, what's with this whole parade of emotion?)

[Chorus]
Oh, maybe there's still hope
Maybe there's still ho-oh-oh
Oh, maybe there's still hope
Maybe there's still ho-oh-oh

[Outro]
If what I want is what you want
Wanna be like that, then be like that3Embed
