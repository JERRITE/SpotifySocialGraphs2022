Sweat (SOPHIE Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: LIZ]
Physical regime, making all the windows steam
Do you need to catch your breath?
Do it fast or do it slow, high impacted cardio
Think you might be out of your depth

[Pre-Chorus 1: LIZ]
Do you need to catch your breath?
Think you might be out of your depth

[Chorus: LIZ]
Make you sweat
Drippin' down your neck
Let's get together
Gonna make you sweat
My silhouette running round your head
Let's get together
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna make you sweat
[Interlude: John Tejada]
What you wanna take tonight?
Where do you wanna go tonight?
And the roof opened up
I heard about this one party
There's just sweat on the wall

[Verse 2: LIZ]
Need reassurance, work on your endurance
How much longer can you last?
Push it to the limit, over in a minute
Burning up until you crash

[Pre-Chorus 2: LIZ]
How much longer can you last?
Burning up until you crash

[Chorus: LIZ]
Make you sweat
Drippin' down your neck
Let's get together
Gonna make you sweat
My silhouette running round your head
(I heard about this one party)
Let's get together
Gonna make you sweat
Gonna make you sweat
You might also like[Outro: John Tejada]
There's just sweat on the wall
Sweat drippin' down the wall
Drippin' on your head and your hair
Messin' up your gel
Makes you wanna dance
