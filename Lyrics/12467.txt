The Graveyard Near The House LyricsThe other day when we were walking by the graveyard near the house you asked me if I thought
We would ever die
And if life and love both fade so predictably
We've made ourselves a kind of predictable lie
So I pictured us like corpses
Lying side by side in pieces in some dark and lonely plot under a bough
We looked so silly there, all decomposed, half turned to dust in tattered clothes
Though we probably look just as silly now
Bye, bye, bye, bye bye, bye to all this dogged innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
Do you?
It left me to wonder if people ever know each other
Or just stumble around like strangers in the dark
Because sometimes you seem so strange to me
I must seem strange to you
We're like two actors playing our parts
Did you memorize your lines? Cause I did
Here's the part where I get so mad
I tell you that I can't forget the past
You get so quiet now and you seem somehow like a lost and lonely child and you just hope that the moment won't last

Bye, bye, bye, bye bye, bye to all this dogged innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
Yeah, you have no idea about me
Do you?

Still, there's always a way around
There's something tying our feet to the ground
A moment passed, we hear how it sounds
And it seems a little less profound
Like we're all going the same way down
Yeah, we're all going the same way down
I'm just trying to write it all down
Cause I write songs, and you write letters
We are tied like two in tethers
And we talk and read and laugh and sleep at night in bed together
And you wake in tears sometimes, I can see the thoughts flash across your eyes
They say, "Darling will you be kind?
Will you be a good man and stay behind if I get old?"

With the words that I was told
About the fading flesh of life and love
The failures of the bold
I can list each crippling fear like I'm reading from a will
And I'll defy every one and love you still
I will carry you with me up every hill
And if you die before I die
I'll carve your name out of the sky
I'll fall asleep with your memory and dream of where you lie
It may be better to move on
And to let life just carry on
And I may be wrong
Still I'll try
Cause it's better to love whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love and I will love you until I dieEmbed
