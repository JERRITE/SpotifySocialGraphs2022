When It Cuts Lyrics[Verse 1]
I cannot justify your envy
But I will be understanding when you stay
Then I will satisfy you in every (way)
But I'm not feeling coherent when you say

[Chorus]
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep
And I die again, again
[Verse 2]
Though I might, I don't think I'll win this fight
But I'm trying though it's ripping me inside
Just in case that I'm taking up your space
I'll be feeling too, whatever's left inside

[Chorus]
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep
And I die again

[Bridge]
Again, again
I can't go on
I'm not that strong
I'm so alone
You just gotta set me free
I'm still living day, no way
I don't care what you say
Your eyes despise my lies
Just say goodbye

[Chorus]
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep and I
Whenever it cuts, it cuts, it cuts deep
And I die again
You might also like[Outro]
Again, again
Waste your breathEmbed
