Canâ€™t Get Better Than This (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Intro]
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this

[Chorus]
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
She said, "it can't get better than this"
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
[Verse]
I don't wanna go away
I wish this happened everyday
I'm looking at the bright lights
But still chasing fireflies
We don't know where we are
But we're still dancing on a star
Now we're looking at the bright lights
But I was still chasing fireflies

[Chorus]
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
She said, "it can't get better than this"
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this

[Verse]
I don't wanna go away
I wish this happened everyday
I'm looking at the bright lights
But still chasing fireflies
We don't know where we are
But we're still dancing on a star
Now we're looking at the bright lights
But I was still chasing fireflies

Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
She said, "it can't get better than this"
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than thisEmbed
