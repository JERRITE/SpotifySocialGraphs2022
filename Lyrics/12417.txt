Iâ€™m Not The Enemy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know you
Don't know those melancholy eyes I see
Do you even know me?
Your scent is familiar
Your voice familiar, but those words you speak
Are not familiar to me

[Hook]
You can't love nobody, unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
Are you the man I love, the man I know loves me?
Come on, talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
[Verse 2]
Your worries, your stress
Are both the root of your unhappiness
Fueled by insecureties
The pressures of being a man is hard
Don't think I don't understand
Put a little faith in me

[Hook 2]
You can't love nobody, unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
We can't be happy until you're happy with yourself
Come on, talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy

[Bridge]
Ooh, what I feel is unconditonal
I love you at your best and at your worst
Don't shove me out
I'm here for you, I'm on your side

(Humming break)

[Hook 1]
You can't love nobody, unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
Are you the man I love, the man I know loves me?
Come on, talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemy
You might also like[Hook 2]
You can't love nobody, unless you love yourself
Don't take it out on me, baby
I'm not the enemy
We can't be happy, until you're happy with yourself
Come on, talk to me, boy
I'm not the enemyEmbed
