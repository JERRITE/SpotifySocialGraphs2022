Lost On Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Ha-ahhh)
I've an empty room, inside it's true, you need no name
Be old and bruised in stolen shoes
You feel the same, baby
Not on what you wear or a length of hair is there ease to define
The cut of your pith, the sound from your lips, it's truly divine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far
[Chorus]
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

[Verse 2]
(Ha-ahhh)
I've a royal love for the common blood, let me colour your bones
Sometimes the simplest thing, an elegant sting resounds the most

[Pre-Chorus]
You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

[Chorus]
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

[Bridge]
(Get lost on me)
(Get lost on me)
Chemically so heavenly
Never been too far
You might also like[Chorus]
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

[Chorus]
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on meEmbed
