Lovinâ€™ Every Minute Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello
Human, what you crying for?
Why can't you see you're beautiful?
I'll be your friend when it's difficult

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're high, then you're low
Give me trust and then go cold
You gotta believe
That there's something more
[Chorus]
'Cause it's all inside your mind
Promise it'll all be fine
Can't you see that it's our time?
Let's go lovin' every minute of it
See the signs that we 'bout take a flight
So sit back, enjoy the ride
And keep lovin' every minute of it

[Drop]
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

[Post-Chorus]
Right now we're in the right place
Feelin' good, bad vibes get away
Next chapter, let's write a new page
'Cause I'm lovin' every minute with you

[Verse 2]
Human, these will be the days
High in the sky bending time and space
You've got a friend
Can you feel the change?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the time, we can grow
Give me trust, away we go
You gotta believe
That there's something more
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause it's all inside your mind
Promise it'll all be fine
Can't you see that it's our time?
Let's go lovin' every minute of it
See the signs that we 'bout take a flight
So sit back, enjoy the ride
And keep lovin' every minute of it

[Drop]
Lovin' every minute of it
Lovin' every minute of it

[Post-Chorus]
Right now we're in the right place
Feelin' good, bad vibes get away
Next chapter, let's write a new page
