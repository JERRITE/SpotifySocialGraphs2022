Change Your Mind Lyrics[Chorus]
Go and take the northern line
And leave the ghost of us behind
'cause I refuse to turn back time
I dont want to change world, I

[Verse 1]
I'm taking a train to where we used to stay
Remember your smile, remember every day
Now I'm falling
Yeah, I'm falling
Smoking a lot and I'm screaming your name
Bars are closed but I'm drinking again and I'm falling
You were calling
[Verse 2]
I'm picking up the phone, I don't wanna hear your voice
I don't even wanna be in love, I wanna feel your love, I need a moment to hold on
And everything is useless, give it a try
Tears of London I don't know why
Your eyes are dry
Let's travel again

[Chorus]
So go and take the northern line
And leave the ghost of us behind
'cause I refuse to turn back time
Oh, I don't want to change the world, I
Just wanna change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
Oh, I don't wanna change the world, I
Just wanna change your mind

[Verse 3]
Still giving it all but the journey is hard
Low signals, back to the start
And I'm crawling, yeah, i'm falling
Knocking at your door, I just wanna feel your touch
You know I'll never give it up, the memory of us
Two lovers on a train
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm gonna take your eyes and make them see that everything you are is everything I need
When the lights come down on these empty streets
I will lead you home
If you wait for me

[Chorus]
So go and take the northern line
And leave the ghost of us behind
'cause I refuse to turn back time
No, I don't want to change world, I

[Chorus 2]
So go and take the fifty nine and leave my heart to even whine
'cause I won't pray
The stars align
Oh, I don't wanna change the world, I
Just wanna change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
No, I don't wanna change the world, I
Just wanna change your mind4Embed
