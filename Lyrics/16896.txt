Green Day Artist Cleanup Page LyricsWelcome to the Green Day artist cleanup page!Hi there! This is the Green Day artist cleanup page, pretty self-explanatory. I noticed Green Day's artist page was a bit messy, especially in their earlier discography, so I decided to start this! If you wanna join in while the cleanup is ongoing, just message me. Thanks! ("1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours" is not here because fixing the prior EPs/album will fix all of the songs on it anyway.
