Dreaming in Electric Blue LyricsLonely ones
You aren't the only ones
We are feeling
We can feel it
Broken hearts
Left with a lovers mark
We are feeling
We can feel it

You can't give up, give in, I swear you'll see
Every hope will come to be
So just keep
Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you
Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you

Tears we cried
Become a lullaby
Keep on singing
Just keep singing
It's a healing tune
You're gonna know it soon
Keep on singing
Just keep singing

You can't give up, give in, I know you'll see
All your hopes will come to be
So just keep

Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you
Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you
You might also likeAll of the goodbyes
Every heartbreak
They turn to magic
Bright and blue
So don't stop believing
Every wish comes true
True

Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you
Dreaming in, dreaming in
Dreaming in electric blue
'Cause somebody, 'cause somebody
Somebody's gonna love you

Keep on dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming in electric blue
Every dream will come to be just
Keep on dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming in electric blueEmbed
