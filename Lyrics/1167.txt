Body Moves Lyrics[Intro]
Ow
Hey
That's right
Oh

[Verse 1]
Side by side
Walkin' home, stumblin' home, gettin' curious
What's on your mind?
'Cause what's on mine's a dirty mind, why so serious?
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feelin' this (Ow)

[Chorus]
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)
Comin' home with me, oh, baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it (Ow)
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)

[Verse 2]
Got all night
Show me more, a little more, it's gettin' scandalous
Yeah, all my life, yeah
Been waitin' for the girl next door to get real dangerous (Get real dangerous)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feelin' this (Ow)

Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)
Come on home with me, oh, baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it (Ow)
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)

[Bridge]
Ha, that's right, haha

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feelin' this (Ow)

[Chorus]
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, oh, just a little bit more, ow)
Come on home with me, oh, baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ooh-oh, ow)
[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it (Ow)
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves (Hey)
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit), body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow)
