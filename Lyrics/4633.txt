Scrabble Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for these forty pointers in my Cartis
Early mornings, late for school, we was beefing more than Arby's
Toting choppers like a Harley, daydreaming of a damn Marley
Off-White same color as a Stanback
Quick to bleed a nigga block, that's a Tampax
Stepped on a chicken pot pie in some Vangracks
We them ones giving head taps
Niggas know the truth, I dissent, I let you and your mans cap
How many times I gotta tell you niggas?
They know the real from the fake
Man these hoes, they could tell the difference
How many times I had to bail you niggas out?
Singlеhandedly, I'm the one who hеld the city down
By my lonesome, ask who did it first, me that's who
Whole brick of Sade, this shit the sweetest taboo
From where the FBI and DEA'll snatch you
Give you so many letters, shit look like you playing Scrabble
Let's get it
[Chorus]
Until the judge bang the gavel
Until the truth be told and what have you
Until the story unfold and unravel
Until the evidence presented in the court of law
And the jury found me guilty, still it's ConCreatures
Even if they send me up shit creek without a paddle
It's Gametime Mafia where loyalty is law
Ducking the alphabet, shit feel like we playing Scrabble
Yeah, faxing so many letters, shit look like we playing Scrabble
Ducking the alphabet boys, feel like we playing Scrabble
Euro stepped the work so hard, they damn near called a travel
Putting them squares back together like a game of Scrabble

[Verse 2]
He talking all that choppy shit, that really ain't his thing
Rocking out with Reddie and the bullies, gave 'em angel wings
Show up and show out, we ain't really tryna make a scene
Smear a little touch-up paint on it, I mix the Maybelline
Put a blue check on yo' head and verify your glizzy
Hope you niggas ready to die, 'cause that ain't no biggie
Shedding tears never clarified your pity
I'll pop out with the mop sticks and terrify your city
My lil' niggas in the field like a ball diamond
Just because you don't see me that don't mean I ain't involved kinda
Sorta, get big bands by the border and
We move that weight quick, SlimFast, Tommy Lasorda
You might also like[Chorus]
Until the judge bang the gavel
Until the truth be told and what have you
Until the story unfold and unravel
Until the evidence presented in the court of law
And the jury found me guilty, still its ConCreatures
Even if they send me up shit creek without a paddle
It's Gangtime Mafia, where loyalty is law
Ducking the alphabet, shit feel like we playing Scrabble
Yeah, faxing so many letters, shit look like we playing Scrabble
Ducking the alphabet boys, feel like we playing Scrabble
Euro stepped the work so hard, they damn near called a travel
Putting them squares back together like a game of ScrabbleEmbed
