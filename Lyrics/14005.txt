Hanging Off Your Cloud Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Liam Fray]
I still miss you
Am I allowed to say it, I just second guess you?
Spend the night in Monterey
Is what I gave you not enough?
I don't need that other stuff
Maybe, it's just not for me to understand
Burn the midnight oil at both ends
It has a habit of not paying dividends
Like a roaming vagabond in the home-town and beyond
I don't know what corner you're gonna be around
[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Is your brother still the man?
Drowning in your love
'Cause you're taking me above
And we know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloud
The city never sleeps
We're going in too deep
And we know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloud

[Verse 2]
You still phone me knowing I won't be asleep
But 'cause you know me
You know I'll struggled when I see
Your name in all L.E.D
And you know I guarantee: if I answer, no good is gonna come of it
Are you thinking if things hadn't gone this way
Would we grow older and lead each other astray?
Like when we were seventeen
And your daddy wasn't keen
I spent late nights so weak, wondering what we're gonna be

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Is your brother still the man?
Drowning in your love
'Cause you're taking me above
And we know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloud
The city never sleeps
We're going in too deep
And we know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloud

Where are you now?
Is your brother still the man?
Drowning in your love
'Cause you're taking me above
And I know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloud
The city never sleeps
We're going in too deep
And we know it's not allowed but I'm hanging off your cloudEmbed
