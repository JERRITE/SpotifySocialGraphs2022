I Go Crazy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got no clue what you're thinking
You move your hand away from mine
Shifty eyes and indecisions
Why does this happen every time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, won't somebody hold me and tell me it'll all work out
Say that there's nothing to worry about now
'Cause I'm so sick of the drama and I hate to shout
But you drag it out of me
[Chorus]
Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your tears, don't phase me
Say something before I go crazy now
I go crazy
I go crazy (I go crazy now)
I go crazy
I go crazy

[Verse 2]
I feel like all of this has aged me
Right on the edge of 22
You look like you've just seen a monster
Is that what I look like to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh won't somebody hold me and tell me it'll all work out
Say that there's nothing to worry about now
'Cause I'm so sick of the drama and I hate to shout
But you drag it out of me

[Chorus]
Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your tears, don't phase me
Say something before I go crazy now
I go crazy
I go crazy (I go crazy now)
I go crazy
I go crazy

It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
My tears, your fears, amaze me
But I'm still so devoted to you, it scares me

[Chorus]
Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your tears, don't phase me
Say something before I go crazy now
I go crazy
I go crazy (I go crazy now)
I go crazy
I go crazy (I go crazy now)
I go crazy
I go crazy (I go crazy now)
I go crazy
Oh, I go crazy

[Outro]
I go crazy, I go crazy (It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time)
I go crazy, I go crazy (It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time)
I go crazy, I go crazy (It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time)
I go crazy, oh I go crazy (It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time)8Embed
