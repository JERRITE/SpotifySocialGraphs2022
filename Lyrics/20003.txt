Name Tattoo Lyrics[Intro: Rittz]
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Now the pussy got wants, never came back to (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude

[Verse 1: Rittz]
You could give her anything she wants
Wine and dine her on a date, two one hundred dollar plates
Steakhouse, give filet mignons
And she might take her clothes off her body but my name stays on
And I know you hate to see it, you tryin' not to look
Imagine I was shocked, never thought she'd fall in love
I fucked her once, and afterwards she told me all she wants
Is a tattoo of my name and she went and got it done
Thought that one bitch was crazy, fuckin' her just made it worse
There's several others that I fucked with did the same as her
Starin' at it in the mirror on her bathroom break at work
She said my signature reminds her how I made her squirt
Better, badder, she's a soaker, told me that I broke her record
Squirtin' like a water gun, we Super Soaker sexin'
Her man wanted to cover it, she told him no and kept it in
Any chick this skeptical to get the dick, I told them "Let me, bitch"
[Chorus: Rittz]
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
On your neck, on your chest, on that ass, that's cute (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Now the pussy got wants, never came back to (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Lil' bitch

[Verse 2: Big HUD]
We wanted friend with benefits
Baby, that's common sense
We not a couple, but stick together like condiments
When I'm around, you just be oozin' with confidence
Gimme some space, you on my side like a money clip
You not just my only bitch, I gotta spread out my time
Keep 'em all happy, that's how you stay the fuck out a bind
Tattin' my name all on your body, that's outta line
I gave no permission, girl, that's like you done did a crime
But I appreciate the effort
You ain't gotta really gas me up like a Tesla (nah)
Just because I beat the pussy up like a wrestler
White girl - how it feel to call a nigga "Master" (hahaha)
Faster, faster, that's what you always screamin'
Shakin' all over the bed, I got you out here feignin'
Takin' my phone, reading my messages is schemin'
We would never be together, baby, stop dreamin'

Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
On your neck, on your chest, on that ass, that's cute (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Now the pussy got wants, never came back to (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Lil' bitch

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Don't ask me how much pussy I get
I don't care if she yours or my bitch
If you hit it from the back, and look at her ass
You gon' know for a fact I was there in the past
Now who you gon' ask them questions to?
She fucked me, and the rest of them dudes
It's her choice, she don't wanna be your angel
She's hella wild, gotta grab her by the ankles
Whatcha gon' do with a bitch you can't handle?
Playin' love songs and burnin' candles (she want what?)
She's gonna cum, she a nut freak
You see that dollar sign on her butt cheek (you see it)
She told this bitch ass she wanna fuck with me
She know one woman ain't enough for me
And she still wanna fuck with Playboy $hort
I told her meet me at the airport
BITCH!
[Chorus: Rittz]
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
On your neck, on your chest, on that ass, that's cute (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Now the pussy got wants, never came back to (biatch)
Bitch, I bet you get my name tattoo'd
Told her not to fall in love 'cause I ain't that dude (biatch)
Lil' bitch

(Biatch!)
(Oh, no. I can't do that)Embed
