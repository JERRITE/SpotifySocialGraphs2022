100 Missed Calls Lyrics[Chorus]
When I woke up I had 100 missed calls, text, message
No I can't talk and I don't wanna kick it (naw)
I dont got time for chillin'
You know I grind not get it (grind)
I was in the valley with Billy (Billy)
I made a diamond dirty many
Might pull up eight diamonds
I'm dirty dick with my niggas (gang)
Neck full of diamonds
I got the rock like I'm June (ice, ye)
Give me a tool like I'm Bob The Builder (mhm)
Racks that talk
Every account, every stash getting filled
Have you ever seen a hundred thou-blue hunid Bill's (huh?)
They say I'm Hollywood, I'm in the hills
Got 4g auto all on my whip (shit)
Shit just got sentenced my brother got killed (fuck)
All yall niggas wan be like Mal Lil Quill
Come to Zone 6 where that shit get to real
[Verse]
Racks, bust in my pockets I got to many bans I ain't fearing (damn)
Take her back stage let her suck 10 mins (ahh)
Dont got much time for these bitches (no)
I got this shit on lock like a pick (on lock)
Got my own Guwap I ain't ask you for shit (rack)
Yes I got paid, for like a million (ye)
When I get bored then I might (?) hit
Rocking Dior got your bitch on my dick
Drip, and my wrist got a whole brick
Hop in a foreign do tricks
Look at this shit
We was so broke i ain't think we would ever get fix
I turn this into a business
Spending this money I'm dizzy
Switching my cars and all on (?)
Last night I flew to Philly

[Chorus]
When I woke up I had 100 missed calls, text, message
No I can't talk and I don't wanna kick it (naw)
I dont got time for chillin'
You know I grind not get it (grind)
I was in the valley with Billy (Billy)
I made a diamond dirty many
Might pull up eight diamonds
I'm dirty dick with my niggas (gang)
Neck full of diamonds
I got the rock like I'm June (ice, ye)
Give me a tool like I'm Bob The Builder (mhm)
Racks that talk
Every account, every stash getting filled
Have you ever seen a hundred thou-blue hunid Bill's (huh?)
They say I'm Hollywood, I'm in the hills
Got 4g auto all on my whip (shit)
Shit just got sentenced my brother got killed (fuck)
All yall niggas wan be like Mal Lil Quill
Come to Zone 6 where that shit get to real

Real deal Holy field (yeah)
Bitch I got drip like a oil spill
Just think about if lil plug was here (plug)
I know he’ll put them racks up to his ear
Come from that script I had to run up my chips
Tay Tay show me loose lips ain’t shit (damn)
I bet that hoe leave when your bankroll skimp (fact)
All these hoes working their lips
Shoot at yo crib f&n give you a kiss
We dont attempt we don’t miss
Left em stanking just like fish
Niggas so broke they don’t even exist
I ball for real never been on the bench
I hit and I pass her so quick (so quick)
Not with the takin and shit
Definitely ain’t having no time to be texting

[Chorus]
