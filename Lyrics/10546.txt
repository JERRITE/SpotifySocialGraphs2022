American Healthcare (Glitzy) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was seven years old
I saw a dead man in the road
Outside the liquor store a few blocks from my school
Well he was cold and he was warm
He looked the damn same as before
Except for something in the eyes and a bit of drool

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, people die every day
I wouldn't have it any other way
I just think they should feel good while they are alive
I went to school, I got good grades
I don't know you want me to say
But tell me fastеr 'cause you're running out of time
[Chorus]
I wantеd to help people
I thought that I could save the sick
And if it's all the same to you
There's one more thing I gotta do
Because with God as my witness (With God as my witness!)
You corporate fucking prick (You corporate fucking prick)
I did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick
(I did not become a doctor just to suck the devil's dick!)

[Refrain]
I fucking helped people
I did my best to save the sick
God as my witness
I won't suck the devil's dick
I won't

[Verse 2]
I made it though all four years
And then almost a decade more
I asked the right questions, I never even really got bored
They hired me in my hometown
And then again when I moved away
People liked me back then, what can I say?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I can say it was the government
The companies, bureaucracy
The congressmen, the lobbyists, and lies
It trickled into both my ears
It got louder over the years
Until all that I could hear were fucking flies
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
People die every day
I wouldn't have it any other way
I just think they should feel okay while they're alive
How could they ever feel okay
When things are more and more this way?
Sometimes it's like they'd rather die

[Chorus]
But I fucking helped people
I tried my best to save the sick
And if it's all the same to you
There's one more thing I've gotta do
Because with God as my witness
You corporate fucking prick
I did not become a doctor for this
[Refrain]
I wanted to help people
I did my best to save the sick
With god as my witness
I did not go to med school for this
I fucking helped people
I did my best to save the sick
With god as my witness
I won't suck the devil's dick
I wanted to help people
I did my best to save the sick
With god as my witness
I did not get through med school for this
I wanted to help people
I did my best8Embed
