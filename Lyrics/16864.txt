Feeninâ€™ Lyrics[Intro: DeVante Swing]
Hit me
All the chronic in the world couldn't even mess with you
You're the ultimate high
You know what I'm saying, baby?
Now check this out

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Take my money
My house and my cars
For one hit of you
You can have it all, baby baby
'Cause makin' love
Every time we do
Girl, it's worse than drugs
'Cause I'm an addict of you
And you know that I...
[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci ad-libs)]
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'
(Got me going crazy)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you
(Said I'm feenin' for you)

[Verse 2: JoJo]
I don't have a mind
It's all blown on you, baby
Girl, I'm so strung out
All I do is wish for you
So tomorrow if you're not here
Then girl I'm down
So I need you near
I just wanna make it through the night
So hold me tight
Then girl I'm alright

[Chorus: Jodeci + (JoJo ad-libs)]
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'
(Girl you got everything that I need, got everything that I need)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you

Lady, I'm hooked on you (Girl, I'm hooked on you)
There's nothing else I'd rather do (Nothing else I'd rather do)
Spend my last dime (All of my money)
For a drop of your time (And you know, oh)
Surely, girl, without a doubt (Honey without a doubt)
You know you got me strung out
And I need you more
And more
'Cause you are my joy
(My joy, joy, joy...)

[Chorus: Jodeci + (JoJo ad-libs)]
You got me feenin'
(You got me feenin'; you got me feenin', yes you do)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin' (You got me going crazy, baby)
Girl, I'm feenin' for you (You got me going crazy, baby)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin' (I said you got me feenin')
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin' (Girl, you got me going crazy)
Girl, I'm feenin' for you (Girl, you got me going crazy, yeah)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin' (I said you got me feenin')
Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'

I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you
I can't leave you alone

Feenin', you got me feenin', feenin'
