Takeoffs and Landings Lyrics[Verse 1]
On this coldest of January nights
We'll drive out past the runway and watch the planes go flying by
The runway lights are the deepest blue like the colors of your eyes
So close them tight and kiss me one last time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you could go anywhere right now, where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there?
There's no place that I would rather be
[Chorus]
Please don't let me go falling from the sky
This fasten seatbelt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from here

[Verse 2]
Passport, customs, carry-on, remember
To shut off all of your electronic devices
Fell asleep on Tuesday, woke up Monday afternoon
I slept right through your international dateline

[Pre Chorus]
If you could go anywhere right now, where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there?
There's no place that I would rather be

[Chorus]
Please don't let me go falling from the sky
This fasten seat belt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from here

[Chorus]
Please don't let me go falling from the sky
This fasten seat belt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from here
You might also like[Chorus]
Please don't let me go falling from the sky
This fasten seat belt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from hereEmbed
