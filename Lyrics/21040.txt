Never Gonna Fall in Love Again Lyrics[Verse 1:]
No use pretending
Things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say

I'll get along
Without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away

[Chorus:]
Never gonna fall in love again
I don't wanna start with someone new
Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never wanna feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

[Verse 2:]
At first we thought
That love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right

But like the sun
We watched it fade away
From morning into lonely night
