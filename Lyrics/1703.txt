I'm on the line right now
I need your time right now
I can't sleep tight without
Your lips on mine somehow

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae & Steve Lacy]
When will I meet you? I'm down to see you
I wanna see you right now
It's been a year now, I shed a tear down
My face dripping, drown my feelings
Enter this one text, I wonder what is next?
Will I catch real feelings for you?
Or could this be pointless? I should've avoided this
But what if this real?
[Verse 2: Ravyn Lenae]
I'm on the line right now
Is our time running out?
Into different worlds
Fly out, come hold me down

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae & Steve Lacy]
When will I meet you? I'm down to see you
I wanna see you right now
It's been a year now, I shed a tear down
My face dripping, drown my feelings
Enter this one text, I wonder what is next?
Will I catch real feelings for you?
Or could this be pointless? I should've avoided this
But what if this real?

[Bridge Ravyn Lenae]
Don't care what nobody say
A thousand miles in the way
You pick the time and the day
I got it, I got it
You knew it right from the start
Computer love is not smart
Don't lose it, don't break my heart
Don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)

When will I meet you? I'm down to see you (I'm down to see you)
I wanna see you right now
It's been a year now, I shed a tear down
My face dripping, drown my feelings
Enter this one text, I wonder what is next?
Will I catch real feelings for you?
Or could this be pointless? I should've avoided this
But what if this real?

[Outro: Ravyn Lenae]
Don't fade away, my love
In cyberspace, my love
One click away from you
Don't fade away
