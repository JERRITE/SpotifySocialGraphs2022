Moving To New York Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've just had the craziest week
Like a party bag of lies, booze, and then deceit
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

[Chorus]
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me
[Verse 2]
I put one foot forward and ended up thirty yards back
And am I losing touch or am I just completely off the track?
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

[Chorus]
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for meYou might also likeEmbed
