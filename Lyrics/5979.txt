People Need A Melody Lyrics[Intro]
Pick yourself up, kid
Pick yourself up, kid

[Verse 1]
Pick yourself up, kid
I can't bear the weight
Pick your mood up, friend
We don't have the time
When you find someone
We don't run away
Pick yourself up, kid
[Verse 2]
All those books in your head
Is that all this really was?
Just a role you play
That you could hide behind
Is it what you want?
To bury yourself away
Before your time goes

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

[Chorus]
'Cause people need a melody to open their eyes
Like a key to a memory frozen in time
Holding onto everything, you're stuck in the past
Boy, when you gonna learn the world moves fast?

[Verse 3]
So pick yourself up, kid
I can't bear the weight
Let the light back in
'Cause you've been walking blind
Now it's all on you
Don't you let it fade
Before your time goes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

[Chorus]
'Cause people need a melody to open their eyes
Like a key to a memory frozen in time
Holding onto everything, you're stuck in the past
Boy, when you gonna learn the world moves fast?
The world moves

[Bridge]
It's been a little while since we've been together
It's been a long time since we were young and wild, remember?
When we were friends, remember?
When we were lovers
It's not too late, it was never too late

[Chorus]
People need a melody to open their eyes
To a memory frozen in time
Holding onto everything, you're stuck in the past
Boy, when you gonna learn the world moves fast?
People need a melody to open their eyes
To a memory frozen in time
[Outro]
I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have
I don't want a love that holds us backEmbed
