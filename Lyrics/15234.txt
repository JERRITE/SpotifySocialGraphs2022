Pretty Peggy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I will stand here
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again
Pretty Peggy
I used to know
Where have you gone, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?
[Chorus]
We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy
We could have it all

[Verse 2]
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I will take them all
And give them to you
I will stand here
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one more dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?

[Hook]
We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy
We could have it all
We will live there
Without no care
Pretty Peggy
Can I take you there?

Pretty Peggy
Was her name
Where have you gone?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

[Outro]
Do you feel the same?
(We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy)
Do you feel the same?
(We will live there
Without no care
Pretty Peggy)1Embed
