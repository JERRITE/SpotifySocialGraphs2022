Danger to Myself Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's an angel on the corner
Honey, there's a devil on my knee
She's a good girl in the morning
She been bad at night only for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I was found in
In a bed of liars
Walking the streets someone before me set on fire
And after all this
This love I've borrowed
I'm waiting on the day you don't want me tomorrow
[Chorus]
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm one step short of wasted
And I see a number on a screen
Oh, I'm a mess and you can t-t-taste it
When I'm getting tangled in your sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I was found in
In a bed of liars
Walking the streets someone before me set on fire
And after all this
This love I've borrowed
I'm waiting on the day you don't want me tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I'll crash the car and drink the bar
Wake up with somebody else
I'm a danger
I'm a danger to myself
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself

[Bridge]
(Danger to myself, danger to myself)
(Danger to myself, danger to myself)
And after all this, love I borrowed
(Danger to myself, danger to myself)
I'm waiting on the day you don't want me tomorrow
I'm a danger

[Chorus]
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself

[Post-Chorus]
I'll crash the car and drink the bar
Wake up with somebody else
I'm a danger
I'm a danger to myself
I'll crash the car and drink the bar
Wake up with somebody else
I'm a danger, I'm a danger
I'm a danger to myself
[Outro]
And I
I don't know why you love me
I'm a danger to myself
And IEmbed
