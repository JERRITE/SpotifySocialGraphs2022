Sweet November Lyrics[Produced by Marvin Gaye]

[Verse 1]
Jesus called me collect last night
It took all of me not to answer
Daddy warned me the perils of playing
Hard to get with God as his standard
Flying high and fearless baby
I've kissed death a thousand times before

[Chorus]
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
[Bridge]
Take (take) time (time)
Flow (flow) shine (shine)
Brilliant (brilliant) light (light)
Angel (angel) fly (fly)

[Verse 2]
Heard you fucking with Tommy again
We both 'member where that landed you last time
That nigga don't really love you girl
He just beds you every night, it's his past-time
Blind eye and the fearless, darling
You two might just do it raw tonight
Heaven help if he leave you girl
I bet you bought two new thongs this time

[Chorus]
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November
Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet November

[Outro]
