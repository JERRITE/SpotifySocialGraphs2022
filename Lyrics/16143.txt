Just a Day Lyrics[Intro]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Waking up at twelve in my clothes again
Feel my head explode from a night of gin
Another night out late
I don't wanna drink
Don't wanna be a clown
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
Before it pulls me in

[Pre-Chorus]
How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna catch me
When I'm coming down to hit the ground again?

[Chorus]
All by myself (waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down
Hold you down
'Cause you're a friend
I blame myself (feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now
Funny now

[Refrain]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-

[Verse 2]
On the underground
With the freaks and frowns
Looking at the world
Through silver clouds
But then it all came down
You might also likeI've gotta rise above
The emotional flood
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands
Pull myself around

[Pre-Chorus]
How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna be there
When I've lost control and I'm heading to crash-land?

[Chorus]
All by myself, (waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down
Hold you down
'Cause you're a friend
I blame myself, (feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now
Funny now

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
All by myself
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down
Hold you down
Cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think it's funny now
Funny now
It's such a shame
All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down
Hold you down
'Cause you're a friend
I blame myself, (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now
Funny now
It's such a sin

All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
Cos' I don't wanna drag you down
Hold you down
Cos' you're a friend
I blame myself, (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now
Funny now

[Outro]

Do-do-do-do
