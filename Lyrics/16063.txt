Deal With It Lyrics[Verse 1: Ashnikko & Kelis]
​I don't need a man, I need a puppy
Allergic to you every time you touch me
Emotional maturity for dummies
I don't have the time to pretend you're funny
I'm back, I'm better
I put that teddy bear you gave me in a blender
I drew a dick on all your sweatshirts
I hate you so much right now

[Chorus: Ashnikko & Kelis]
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you (Ah)
[Verse 2: Ashnikko & Kelis]
I don't need a man, I need a rabbit
I need a new toy just to cleanse my palate (Uh)
Big bad bitch, I'm the baddest
We both know it wasn't love, it was just a big bad habit
Stringing you along like a puppet
I could see the dеsperation, got you right where I want ya
Bеg for it, plead, you can suck it
I hate you so much right now

[Chorus: Ashnikko & Kelis]
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you (Ah)

[Post-Chorus: Ashnikko & Kelis]
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now

[Verse 3: Ashnikko & Kelis]
Find me in a ballgown with a champagne glass
With a man on my arm
I don't care what his name is
I've really leveled up now
I got jets on my back
Everything I do, outrageous
You text me that you miss me
I say, "Who the fuck is this?"
I deleted your number (Oops)
Oh, gee, that's a bummer
I hate you so much right now

Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it 'cause I'm so over you (Ah)

[Post-Chorus: Ashnikko & Kelis]
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now9Embed
