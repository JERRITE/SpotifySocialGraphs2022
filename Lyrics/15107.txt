Hands On The Bible Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hands on the Bible
Scared like a child
God holds you liable
For what you've done

Homicidal
Stared down your idols
A pretty baby
Never born
You can't believe it
You didn't mean it
But they saw you do it
And they know your name

Rats in the attic
Toys in the cellar
She's an addict
He wants to learn

[Verse 2]
Hands on the bible
Egomaniacal
As you screw yourself into oblivion
Worn and faded
Stoned and jaded
You'll have to face it
On your own
Smashed on the pavement
Stunned in amazement
Everything you make comes crawling back to you

You can't believe it
You didn't mean it
But they saw you do it
And they know your name
You might also like[Verse 3]
So hands on the bible
Scared like a child
God holds you liable
For what you've done

Homicidal
Stared down your idols
A pretty baby never to be born

[Bridge]
You can't pretend that you don't know the reasons
For the REPENT at your side
