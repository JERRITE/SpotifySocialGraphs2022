Wish Upon a Star LyricsWish upon a star in a room full of roads
100 pair, air forces turned to gold
{2x}

The biggest flex is to let them see you livin' without stress
I keep it playa can have any ex bitch that I select
Jammin n havin' things, I'm wonderin who is next
But no doubt I'm ready for it
How many stages blazed, how many jets boarded
I smoked 5 joints watering my garden this morning
Pad doublin my twin that's cool fool we both ballin
Bel air lust, that cliquo in the cup, mix em up
I got the cars that you don't drive. you pay somebody else to sit up front
Drop you off at the dinner spot, come back n pick you up
Mostly its my bro though, artillery touch
I'm in the back with a fat jert lit n a cold cup
Bitch text me but I pull up bitch guess what
Wish upon a star in a room full of roads
100 pair, air forces turned to gold
{2x}

My Caritеr frames, diamond encrusted
This class baby, not thеm other niggas you fuck with
(had to put on all five of my chains.....)
My Cariter frames, diamond encrusted
This class baby, not them other niggas you fuck with
Prime time hustlers, ted talk discussions
The way they fumble the bag I be disgusted
We keep the bud lit, niggas know when they love this
The fabric that we cut with, not many is of this
Enough game for you to soak up quotes
How da fuck you celebrate and then you woke up broke?
Hit that nigga with the pack and have em post up low
They wonder old smoke, listen to my old cuts bro
Rich nigga smoking hella L's
Niggas hatin but that never fails, they hold life, I LOL
I chop it up with mello get dame on the cell
Let em know we trailblazers as well
Many talk about, not many is real
Golden era we give em that feel

Wish upon a star in a room full of roads
100 pair, air forces turned to gold
