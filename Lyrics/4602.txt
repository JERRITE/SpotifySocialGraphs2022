American Boyfriend Lyrics[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Simple girl, I ended up on your dad's doorstep
(She was a simple girl)
Suddenly, my body fell into yours

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface]
Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna die on sunset (I wanna die, I wanna die)
(He was a pop star with a bounty on his head)
My parents wanna kill me, let 'em kill me
I'll finally be on TV

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
(Say it again now, say it again now, yeah)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface]
Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, yeah
I found my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I found my way
I found my way
I found my way
