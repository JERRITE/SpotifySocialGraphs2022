Piped up, piped up, bih', how you feel?

[Verse 1]
Flip-phone, got it, yeah, I ain't got no chill
Hold up, swole up when we in the field
Really, I need me a Rollie
Balling in L.A., no Kobe
Liking all of my pics like she know me
Dick her down in the night and she leave in the morning, I'm yawning, hey
[Chorus]
Smellin' like a hundred dollar bill
Smellin' like a hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bill, hey
Smellin' like a hundred dollar bill
Smellin' like a hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bill, hey
Smellin' like a hundred dollar bill
Smellin' like a hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bill, hey
Smellin' like a hundred dollar bill
Smellin' like a hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bill, hey

Hey, lil' bitch
Hundred dollar bill

Hey, never take a L
Roll the window down for the smell
She just popped two and she feelin' herself
All I know is get money, all I know is get paper
All I know is stack up, I be flexing on a hater, hey
