Hello, Goodbye/Galaxie Lyrics[Hello, Goodbye: a hidden song accessed by rewinding from the first song on CD. Vocals are reversed]
Whoa yeah
Now she's telling me she'll have my baby
And a faithful father I am to be
When I'm looking into the eyes of our own baby
Will it bring me life in me
Deep inside I must defy our arrangement
I'm stumblin' from my starting blocks till now
And I'll always try to justify [???]
There's a beautiful life to behold
And it's the biggest part of my life
One for [???]
Whoa yeah
Now she's telling me she'll have my baby
And a father figure I am to be
When I'm looking into the eyes of our own baby
Will it bring new life into me
Oh please, oh please, oh please
[Intro]
I'm entering a frame bombarded by indecision
Where a man like me can easily let the day get out of control
Down this far in the quarter
I'm pushed hard upon the border
But I'd rather be caught around now
Instead of, oh say, 'round the month of June
But if I can leave with a little bit of explanation
Then, anywhere in the world I choose to go, I'll have it made

[Verse 1]
Is this the place that I want to be?
Is it you, who I want to see?
Holding on, hold it high, show me everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're leaving me
Yeah, you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

[Chorus]
But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
Oh, and I'm never really sure if you'll take what I'm saying the right way
But I'm not appalled or afraid
Verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
I'm more at home in my Galaxie
Oh yeah
You might also like[Verse 2]
Can I do the things I wanna do
That I don't do, because of you?
And I'll take a left and I'll second guess
Into total mess

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're leaving me
Yeah, you're leaving me
You're leaving me with a hated identity

[Chorus]
But I keep on a-comin' here and standing in this state
Oh and I'm always reassured the situation's getting carried away
But I'm not appalled or afraid
Verbal pocket play
Is as discreet as I can muster up to be
Because the Cadillac that's sittin' in the back
It isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
Oh, no, no, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No it isn't me
No, no it isn't me
No it isn't me
