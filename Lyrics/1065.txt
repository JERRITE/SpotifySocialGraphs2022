Hopeless Romantics Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't hold your breath
I don’t think we got much time left
We tried our best
Maybe now we lay this to rest
The hope we had
Is falling through our hands like sand
Do you ever think we had a chance?
Now I see it when I'm looking back

[Chorus]
We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
But I can’t imagine
Falling in love with anybody else
Anybody else
[Verse 2]
One last time
I wanna feel your skin touching mine
When wе said goodbye
I don't wanna see you cry
Or put up a fight
All I ask
Is you remembеr all the times we had
Hope the memories they make you laugh
And you see it when you're looking back

[Chorus]
We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it's tragic
We were hopeless romantics
But I can't imagine
Falling in love with anybody else
Anybody else

[Bridge]
We put our all in
But now we're falling
We didn't know when to call it
Now we're touching down
Put our all in
But now we’re falling
It all makes sense to me now
You might also like[Chorus]
We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it’s tragic
We were hopeless romantics
And I can't imagine
You falling in love with anybody else

We were hopeless romantics
How did this happen?
Baby, our love was beautiful, now it’s tragic
We were hopeless romantics
And I can't imagine
Falling in love with anybody else

[Outro]
Don't hold your breath
I don't think we got much time leftEmbed
