Paddling Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
The west, the warm, the sunny south, I see it's full of ancients
For call the space between the crave, that sound of road to me too

[Hook]
There’s someone here who laughs too hard at everything
There’s someone here who laughs too hard at everything
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
[Verse 2]
For out to London, maintain crowd around here for the weekend We had to take our clothes before the the sun was gone completely
I used to lie thinking clouds aside here and which was dust
I lie as I throw myself out in the shower cold and thin

[Hook]
There’s someone here who laughs too hard at everything
There’s someone here who laughs too hard at everything
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out

You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
Paddling out, paddling out
You say isn’t it hard?
