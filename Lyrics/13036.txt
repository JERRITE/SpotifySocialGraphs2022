Out in the Way LyricsAre you waking me up now?
I was falling headfirst against the waves
It wasn’t you that I could work around

I’m running up and I’m so free
And it just keeps reminding me
All these moments quickly passing me

In the darkness passing through
Tell me is it really you?
You don't look the same as when I was dreaming
Even though it's not much time
I can't get it off my mind
Everything feels different now here without you

Out in the way

It wasn’t you that I could work aroundYou might also likeEmbed
