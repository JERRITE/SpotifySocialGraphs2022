Nothing Comes To Nothing LyricsWon't you come, come back to earth
Say all concerned
You know how they worry for you
And all their words, they jar my nerves I know
Each cursed by each and kisses run through

Nothing comes to nothing without my baby
Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby

That's Amwellian do, tongue soaked in booze
Says 'it's filthy I'm much older than you'
And the sea sick muse
The sickly news pulls out the sickle so shiny cuts the tongue in two
And the music sways, it forays and searches and says:
'Give me all the young and the blue'
And the music sways, it forays and surges and says:
'I'll break your heart in two'

Nothing comes to nothing without my baby
Nothing ever comes to nothing with my baby
All I ever do is sigh

Where's the happy Prince?
Well, where's the smiling Bride?
He's right beside you oh

Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby ah no
Nothing is ever good for nothing with that ladyYou might also likeEmbed
