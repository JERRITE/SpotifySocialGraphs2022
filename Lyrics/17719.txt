Zoo Rock Lyrics[Verse 1: Kwengface]
I close my eyes and I can't stop dreamin' (No)
Tryna dodge my demons (Woo)
I had a nice dream that they bussed DSqueezo's door and they gave him his freedom (Free him up, Bruskiii Ky)
I had a next dream that I caught me a opp boy, yuck, kept on bleedin' (Yuck)
Yo, pick up your bro, don't leave him
I couldn't do that, 'round there, that's treason
Two hands on when I fly this skeng (Bah)
Get slapped with the 9mm (Scratch mixed it)
That one's a mad ting, bro with the skeng then you might get skenged (Bah)
I can't supply and demand in Pecks, I'm hot so it's O where I fly these pebs (OT)
On the lurk, tryna find these gems, I missed, so I'm out tryna slide again
PS, let's grip man's soul (Let's go)
Or just whip them poles like skid then go like shit, then bro (Bah)
Zone 2 Pecks, oh yes, even aunties and the kids, them know (Oi, oi)
Show, Maxo gave him a neck shot in his neck dot, did he swim or float?
I wake up, think nuttin' but juggy (Woo)
Backstrap this cookie (Ayy, ayy)
This ting is pissed 'cause I hit and I skid, gave her the one then doolie
Them man ain't nuttin', they ain't stay for nuttin' (No)
They don't wanna dance and boogie (No)
Opp block flex, swing that ting to your head
But I ain't givin' out noogies
Fly them birds and the jones
[Chorus: Kwengface & PS Hitsquad]
Don't be silly (Don't), get rocked, no milly (Bah)
Man get bucked, no fiddy, for really
Us man run this city (Gang)
Tryna get rich off streams and bitties (Woo)
Golden one, she pretty (Ayy, ayy), golden one, she pretty (Ayy)
Yo, all tryna be my missy (Ayy, come 'ere)
Don't be silly (Ayy, ayy), get rocked, no milly (Woo)
Man get bucked, no fiddy, for really

[Verse 2: PS Hitsquad]
Look, man get G-O-T, tryna make man see G-O-D (Oh, shit)
Shootings like C-O-D, where's GB? Turned P-O-T (Thirteen)
Trap, I been OT, I just link pack for three-on-three (Ring)
Slap, I been OG, I hop in the back, I see those neeks (Who's dat?)
P-O-P, holdin' it down (Down), Hitsquad rollin' around (Hitsquad baby)
Ching man down, he's rollin' around (Ching, ching)
Give him a bath, I'm soaking him down (Ayy, wettin' him)
Black tie in a Batman suit
I back my bruce and he backs mine too (Gang way)
Hitsquad, hashtag two
Still tryna leave, man, hashtag zoots (Switch it)
Spin it, man move wicked, I jump out quick and send two up your chest (Chest shot)
Figdet, my index itches, I back that pivot, you know what's next (Bah, bah)
Chat shit, what you talkin' 'bout Willis?
You know man's wit' it, you know man steps
Ride out 'til there's no one left (Uh)
Do it like Alan Sugar, I point my finger, man get fired (Woof)
Step 'til a man gets tired (Rainy weather)
Hitsquad baby (You play, you lay), Smoke Boys in my section (Smokey)
Swift, I came with my bredren (Who's that?)
Smith, he came with Wesson (Treyway)
Pissed, I aim and press him (Bah)
I bet we teach them on a lesson
