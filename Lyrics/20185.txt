â€‹bad mood, bad year Lyrics[Intro]
Baby, it's alright with me, yeah
Kill me here, I'm on my knees
Don't make me say pretty please
So fucked up, lost everything, yeah
I'm feeling like a love-lost, fuck-up
I know I never made much progress on us
I know I never fucking focus, I guess
I guess I'm just so fucking hopeless at best

[Chorus]
Caught me in a bad place
Bad mood, bad year
I still hear your name
Yeah, it's ringing in my ear
Shoot me through the heart
Hunt me down, please my dear
Baby kill me now
Please, girl let me die here
[Verse]
Bury my dreams beneath these screams
Abandon hope and let me bleed
I called your phone
You called it off
You're at your peak
I'm at a loss
I was so weak
All along
I will admit though
I was wrong

Caught me in a bad place
Bad mood, bad year
I still hear your name
Yeah, it's ringing in my ear
Shoot me through the heart
Hunt me down, please my dear
Baby kill me now
Please, girl let me die here

Caught me in a bad place
Bad mood, bad year
I still hear your name
Yeah, it's ringing in my ear
Shoot me through the heart
Hunt me down, please my dear
Baby kill me now
Please, girl let me die here
[Bridge]
Bury my dreams
Bury my dreams
Just let me bleed
Just let me bleed

Baby, it's alright with me, yeah
Kill me here, I'm on my knees
Don't make me say pretty please
So fucked up, lost everything, yeah

Caught me in a bad place
Bad mood, bad year
I still hear your name
Yeah, it's ringing in my ear
Shoot me through the heart
Hunt me down, please my dear
Baby kill me now
Please, girl let me die here

Caught me in a bad place
Bad mood, bad year
I still hear your name
Yeah, it's ringing in my ear
Shoot me through the heart
Hunt me down, please my dear
Baby kill me now
Please, girl let me die here4Embed
