Don’t Make It Harder on Me Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I need you to stop lookin' at me like that
We are just friends now
You already had your chance
So I need you to stop sayin' the things you say
I don't wanna regret, no
The reason I didn't stay
[Pre-Chorus]
If you keep actin' so sweet
I might just wake up and leave
This boy that I pinky swore
We'd be together for sure
I can't be thinking of you
When I'm alone with my boo
If you smile at me again
I may do somethin' stupid

[Chorus]
Don't make it harder on me
Don't make it harder on me
I told you not to love me
And now you're growing on me
Don't make it harder on me
Don't make it harder on me
I told you not to want me
But you don't listen to me
And you never did

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never did, never did (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Why did we stop bein' together now?
Oh, I just remembered
How many girls you had
So you need to stop bein' so nice to me
'Cause a part of me has moved on
But a part of me is so weak
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
If you keep actin' so sweet (So sweet)
I might just wake up and leave (Leave)
This boy that I pinky swore
We'd be together for sure
I can't be thinking of you
When I'm alone with my boo
If you smile at me again
I may do somethin' stupid

[Chorus]
Don't make it harder on me (Don't make it harder)
Don't make it harder on me
I told you not to love me
And now you're growing on me
Don't make it harder on me
Don't make it harder on me
I told you not to want me
But you don't listen to me
And you never did

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh (Ooh)
Oh, oh (Ooh)
[Outro]
Don't make it harder
Don't make it harder on me
Harder for me
And you never did24Embed
