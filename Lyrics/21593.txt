Wait for Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Knowing love the way I do
I can say for certain that it's true
There's a chance for me and you
I surely feel like the time is near
The picture in my mind is very clear
I think love has brought us here

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember not too long ago
I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be
Be a chance for me to...
[Chorus]
Get the love that I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get the
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
Oh my

[Verse 2]
When you take the chance on love you see
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe
The impossible can be
So hold on tight if you think you're right
'Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
You gave up too easily

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I remember spending all my time
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be
Be a chance, whoa, for me to...

[Chorus]
Get the love that I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get the
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
Oh my
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I never stopped believing there could one day be a chance
For me to...

[Chorus]
Get the love that I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love that you been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love that you been missing
Sometimes love it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love that you been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love...ooh yeah
Sometimes love it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love that you been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time, yeah
But wait for love and you're gonna get the
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love, woo, that you been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get the
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
And you get the love...
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for loveEmbed
