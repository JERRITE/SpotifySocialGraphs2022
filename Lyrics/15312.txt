Social Drinker LyricsYou had a trumpet until you lost it
You thought that music would make you whole
But it only made you feel more alone
And you didn't even lose it
You left it on the train, Southwest
Probably never be seen again
But you won't tell your parents that
'Cause you know that they only meant well
They thought that music could be the distraction
To keep you from damaging yourself anymore
Now there's new cigarettes on your counter
I thought you said you were cutting back
The tragedy is that it started
Because you don't know what to do with your hands
When they're not intertwined, or holding onto someone else
But now you're with me, now you're with me
The smoke on your breath graced the neck of the bottle
The story is complicated, it's too hard to follow
You'd much rather be with lukewarm pink moscato
Than the nice beers that your friends bought
'Cause when you get drunk, it's not to have fun
When you give up, it's not cause you're in love
It's not cause you're in love, it's not
'Cause when you get drunk, it's not to have fun
When you give up, it's not cause you're in love
It's not cause you're in love
'Cause when you get drunk, it's not to have fun
'Cause you when you give up, it's not cause you're in love
It's not cause you're in love, it's not
'Cause when youYou might also like2Embed
