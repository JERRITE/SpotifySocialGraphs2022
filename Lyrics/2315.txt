LET THE GRASS GROW Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wait for the morning tide, the oceans to rise
But I lay here broken, too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck
So I tell myself this lie, I'm not scared to die
Make mole hills of mountains, there's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
So I leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self sabotage, all of our other scars don't compare
[Chorus]
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath, the hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me

[Verse 2]
There's nothing to fill this void
Start turning into sorrows
So I lay here soaking the sand in my bed
What a day to regret

[Pre-Chorus]
So I leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self sabotage, all of our other scars don't compare (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath, the hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone, let the grass grow over me

We didn't make a difference
And we thought we were different
Hey, oh-oh
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah1Embed
