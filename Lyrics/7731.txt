3 Words Lyrics[Verse 1: Cheryl & will.i.am]
I met a guy at the club
I let him know I'm in love
I met a girl at the bar
I let her know who you are
I told her you are the love of my life and
One day, you're gonna be my wife and
We are gonna have some babies together
I told him you are the man of my dreams
You saved me from drowning in the streams
I know we're really gonna last forever and ever
[Chorus: Cheryl, Cheryl & will.i.am]
It was those, three words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated, wasn't premeditated
It wasn't underrated
Boy, I'm so glad you stated those
It was those three words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated, wasn't premeditated
To you I'm dedicated
Let's go ahead and say it
I love you, I love you
You are the love of my life, my life
I love you, I love you, I love you
You are the love of my life, my life

[Verse 2: will.i.am, Cheryl, Cheryl & will.i.am]
You know you're holding my heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You know I'm so in love with you
Can't nothing tear us apart, no
I said I L-O-V-E Y-O-U, I'm so into you, girl
She said: M-E T-O-O, it's obvious I'm so into you, boy
So why don't we (We) hold (Hold) on (On) for (To) love (Love)?
Through the ups and downs, never let go
Holding on forever, never let go

[Chorus: Cheryl & Cheryl & will.i.am]
It all started with three words,  saved my life
It wasn't complicated, it wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated, it wasn't complicated
Baby, those three words saved my life
I love you, I love you
You are the love of my life, my life
I love you, I love you, I love you
You are the love of my life, my lifeYou might also likeEmbed
