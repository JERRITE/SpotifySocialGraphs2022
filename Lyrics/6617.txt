Gathering Storm Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
In the dying moments
You can look to the distance
And you won't miss us
We're coming to resist them
And when there's nothing gonna be left
Oh, yeah
But a single breath and a sea of death
We're gonna stand and defy them
[Pre-Chorus]
So come meet us in the open
'Cause we are sworn to redemption
Come bring all you can bring
It means nothing
We awaken
Yeah

[Chorus]
Just like the tales of prophecies
Just like thе heartbeat of the sеas
We gather, we gather
It matters not what strength you gained
It matters not what gods you bring, we're unafraid
Our voice will raise the dead
We gather

[Verse 2]
'Cause in the dying moments
You can look to the distance
And you won't miss us
We're coming to resist them
And if there's nothing gonna be left
Oh no
But a final stand, so be it
Gonna meet them in the fires
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Come meet us in the open
'Cause we are sworn to redemption
So come bring all you can bring
It means nothing
We're violent precision
So very unforgiving
Yeah

[Chorus]
Just like the tales of prophecies
Just like the heartbeat of the seas
We gather, we gather
It matters not what strength you gained
It matters not what gods you bring, we're unafraid
Our voice will raise the dead
We gather
Yeah

[Bridge]
So very unforgiving
Yeah

[Chorus]
Just like the tales of prophecies
Just like the heartbeat of the seas
We gather, we gather
It matters not what strength you gained
It matters not what gods you bring, we're unafraid
Our voice will raise the dead
We gather
Just like the tales of prophecies
Just like the heartbeat of the seas
We gather, we gather
It matters not what gods you bring
It matters not what guides your fate, we're unafraid
Our voice will raise the dead
We gather, yeah
[Outro]
We gatherEmbed
