4 This Moment Lyrics[Verse]
Guess I forgot this time
Checkin' up on you, I forgot you ain't mine
And it's been worth the time, yeah
Set me back a couple months and I
Been just waiting for signs
Checking my phone, got me fucked up tonight, baby
But I won't even mind
Nothing you do, nothing you do, yeah

[Chorus]
For this moment, I'ma act like everything's okay
For this moment, I'ma act like you with me today
For this moment, I'ma act like you were just right here
For this moment, losing you is not my biggest fear
For this moment, I'ma act like everything's okay
For this moment, I'ma act like you won't fade away
For this moment, girl, because it won't be here for long
For this moment, girl, you know just what I'm waiting on
For this moment, I'ma act like everything's okay
For this moment, I'ma act like you with me today
For this moment, I'ma act like you were just right here
For this moment, losing you is not my biggest fear
For this moment, I'ma act like everything's okay
For this moment, I'ma act like you won't fade away
For this moment, girl, because it won't be here for long
For this moment, girl, you know just what I'm waiting on
[Outro]
Girl, you know just what I'm—
What I'm—
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Girl, you know just what I'm waiting on (Oh, oh-oh, ooh, ooh)
What I'm waiting on (Ooh-ooh-woah, oh, oh, oh)
What I'm waiting, waiting
What I'm waiting, waiting
