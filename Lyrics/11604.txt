Everyone Iâ€™ve Never Met Lyrics[Verse 1]
People make me nervous
Especially in malls
They sprint by skinny models
That are nearly ten feet tall
Highways make me fidget
There are way too many cars
And I'm sure I'd like the drivers
If we pulled aside to talk

[Pre-Chorus]
But from my window they are just a bumper and a light
And I can't see their eyes
[Chorus]
I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
And I don't talk to people anymore

[Verse 2]
Barstools make me sweaty
When there's someone I don't know
I probably look so stupid
Climbing up there on my own
And the man behind the bar
Is probably lovely with his kids
And I am just the ass who didn't order a drink

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl from the internet
And her lips were cold
But I don't talk to people anymore
I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
But I don't talk to people anymore

[Outro]
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never metYou might also likeEmbed
