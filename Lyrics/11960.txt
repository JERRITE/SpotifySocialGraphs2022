2022 Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
(Ivxn Drago)
(I'm shy, oh my God)
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Chorus]
Ayy, get popped over smoke like, bitch, the Woo back
Bad bitch asking 'bout me like, "Who that?"
Bopping off, murder walk, call me Kodak
I got like forty thousand in the trap
I gotta grab on her ass, it's so fat
Shots for a bitch nigga, get the fuck back (Fuck back)
Double homis if I'm sliding with Mac
Whole gang with me booted off flats
Ayy, get popped over smoke like, bitch, the Woo back
Bad bitch asking 'bout me like, "Who that?"
Bopping off, murder walk, call me Kodak
I got like forty thousand in the trap
I gotta grab on her ass, it's so fat
Shots for a bitch nigga, get the fuck back (Fuck back)
Double homis if I'm sliding with Mac
Whole gang with me booted off flats
[Verse]
I got my name in this shit 'cause I walk down
I got your bitch 'cause she lovе how I talk
You can tell I murder just by the walk
I got somе demons with me in the dark
I was eighteen, shot his ass in the park
Get in sport mode, hit the gas, watch it fart
Niggas the police, niggas be narcs
How I'm your baby but you did me wrong?
Ayy, I'm sendin' bullets through your home
Double down baby, you know that it's on
Ayy, I'm killing the kid, ain't no Home Alone
I'm in her spine, I'm breaking her back
She got good head, but that pussy wack
Play with the gang and I'm gettin' you whacked
2022, we still servin' crack
I'm havin' drip and this ain't no VLONE
Pull up and pop it, I aim at your dome
Niggas be callin' my phone for a loan
I'm in the studio making a song
I got tired of having my hands out
Heard the nigga I robbed is your friend now
I be hoppin' the bitch with my bands out
When I pull up, she pullin' her pants down (Ooh-wee)
I'm flexin', lil' bitch, I'm the G.O.A.T
My family came in off a boat
Hop in this shit, but I don't snort coke
I put this dick in her throat
She get this shit on the low
Fly with this shit when I touch down
I be dripped in Off-White like the Pope, yeah
Tell me something I don't know
New clothes, new hoes
[?] Johnny got me froze
Walk in the jewelry store, throw out a bankroll
I could rock a nigga with a Draco
Ain't no muhfuckin' place that I can't go

Ayy, get popped over smoke like, bitch, the Woo back
Bad bitch asking 'bout me like, "Who that?"
Bopping off, murder walk, call me Kodak
I got like forty thousand in the trap
I gotta grab on her ass, it's so fat
Shots for a bitch nigga, get the fuck back (Fuck back)
Double homis if I'm sliding with Mac
Whole gang with me booted off flats
Ayy, get popped over smoke like, bitch, the Woo back
Bad bitch asking 'bout me like, "Who that?"
Bopping off, murder walk, call me Kodak
I got like forty thousand in the trap
I gotta grab on her ass, it's so fat
Shots for a bitch nigga, get the fuck back (Fuck back)
Double homis if I'm sliding with Mac
Whole gang with me booted off flatsEmbed
