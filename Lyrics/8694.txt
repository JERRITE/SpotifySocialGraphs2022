Ride My See-Saw Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Ride, ride my see-saw
Take this place
On this trip, just for me
Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat, it's for free

[Verse 1]
I worked like a slave for years
Sweat so hard just to end my fears
Not to end my life a poor man
But by now, I know I should have run
[Chorus 2]
Run, run my last race
Take my place
Have this number of mine
Run, run like a fire
Don't you run in
In the lanes, run for time

[Verse 2]
Left school with a first class pass
Started work, but as second class
School taught one and one is two
But by now, that answer just ain't true

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 3]
My world is spinning around
Everything is lost that I found
People run, come ride with me
Let's find another place that's free
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Ride, ride my see-saw
Take this place
On this trip, just for me
Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat, it's for free

[Outro]
Ride my see-saw
Ride, ride
Ride my see-saw
Ride my see-saw
Ride my see-saw...Embed
