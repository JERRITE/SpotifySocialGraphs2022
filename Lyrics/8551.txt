Days Like This Lyrics[WHIZZER]
Good morning

[MARVIN]
Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today
You had to see yourself a few days back
I had a heart attack!
Jesus
But today you seem to be
On the way to recovery!
Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!
It's days like this I almost believe in God
Days like this I almost believe
In God
[Cordelia enters, with food]

[CORDELIA]
Hello!

[WHIZZER]
Hi! Food...

[CORDELIA]
Rugelach!
Gefilte fish!
It's so good, you'd think it's Italian!
Also a soup made from chicken
That, though un-exotic, is antibiotic!
Oh, I'm up to my ass
In a kosher morass!
For aches and croup
Try my chicken soup!

I hyperventilate
But since I'm parking in the city, I've improved
Or else the hydrants moved!
