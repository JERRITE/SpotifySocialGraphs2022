Global Concepts Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think it burns my sense of truth
To hear me shouting at my youth
I need a way to sort it out
After I die, I'll re-awake
Redefine what was at stake
From the hindsight of a god

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll see the people that I use
See the substance I abuse
The ugly places that I lived
Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance
Or did I make you fucking dance?
Dance d-d-d-dance
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Symmetry exists only in our mind
Our brain is seeing squares
So I woke up with entropy defined
But the forms still linger there
In my head

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll see the people that I use
See the substance I abuse
The ugly places that I lived
Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance
Or did I make you fucking dance?

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Global concepts aren't common the world 'round
But we share a mortal frame
That if you can't hear reacts to every sound
But no two people move the same
You might also like[Verse 4]
I think it burns my sense of truth
To hear me shouting at my youth
I need a way to sort it out
After I die, I'll re-awake
Redefine what was at stake
From the hindsight of a god

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll see the people that I use
See the substance I abuse
The ugly places that I lived
Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance
Or did I make you fucking dance?
Dance d-d-d-dance
Fucking
Dance

[Instrumental Chorus]6Embed
