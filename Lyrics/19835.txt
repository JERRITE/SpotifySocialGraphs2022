[Verse 1- RAE]

Come on bitch
Come on bitch
did you really think I wasn't gonna double back and drop a second flow
just to let you motherfuckers know
who remote control and who run the show?
Its rae that
(rae that)
hollering back
and moving forward at the same damn time
never will I ever drop the same damn rhyme
killer and the coroner- the same damn crime
(ANDDD)
yall don't really get it right now
im it right now
and everything I do lucrative right now
I hit em with it quick
then I switch the flow up
un-loaded a brick
and I got my dough up
all I really have left to do is just blow up
ofcourse they're gonna shut it down if yall dont show up
my demeanor too sick
all this style I throw up
tell an ass kissing cunt to kick her habit and grow up
jaeger bombs floatin'
pageant moms chokin'
on spermatazoa, my nigga he fucked her and you mad you ain't even get to know her
my walls are lowered, climb on over
gas im chocking on im smoking so my mind is never sober
open minds are never closed
(so make youre mind dey and take off your clothes)

and my boat rock till its star-bed
and im still high as high can go
property of a time of snow
and you know I keep that pair of I can't see you through these
anti-glares
[Verse 3 - Kweku Sensei]

Spit it on them

bad to the bone, im the usual suspect
grab mic, I make it bust like a musket
trust this, you can never fuck with me
yo these girls they need to shape up
head full of weave, face full of make-up

breast and bumper you already know this
when I wrote this it wasn't just for show-biz
in GH but still, source will quote this
bringin out the underground sound when I come around
pound for pound fuck a pound up in one round
THUNDER

[Verse 6 - ATello]

Oh shit, Im untouchable when I touch the flow
red lights can't stop the flow
yall said right about the flow
heard im nice when I drop the flow
I put red eyes on top the flow
im sure these eyes can't watch the flow
shorties rise when I touch the floor
thought it was a lie when I locked the door
man I just hopped off a drop top on the road
with my shirt buttoned up and my tux was on
im just hot dog like im on top the stove
and I hope you whack black rappers know
Im invincible, I'll convince you boo
rayban's can't see me - oliver people's
g-shock dont watch me, my time is real
black Glock safe action stainless steel
drop flows with a passion, I talk that talk
tell the dj, there's alot of girls
pon de replay, like rihanna goes
down to the floor like bils rayoe
oh is that yo chick?
oh is that you bitch?
oh is that yo girl?
she's such a whore
she's stuck on me with the club lights on
and she's on the phone telling you she's home?

[Verse 7 - Korey Costa]

Verbal Exhaust pipe
burn right through frost bite
you've lost sight
do you need help?
my mind is racing need a seatbelt
did you sleep well?
neccessitas una ciesta
who could be loonier
guess that im soon to be dead
a spoon to be fed
is all that they want these moody teen friends-uhhhh
the best of the best
the cutest, im stuck in the forest
im dressed up
BIG in this suit, I'll fit three in this coupe-non conformist
I'll get you some brand names, climbing the wall this is rampage
drowning my feelings in champagne
down with your campaign, im about to jump straight of this fiscal cliff
pistol whips, I'll body a face
rappers these days are just copy and paste
got me a taste now I want me a feast
thanks for the beat from the Ghanaians
crazy and bothered
I made this beat holler
and save me the time and just make me a god and then scram
oh baby intolerance is with the father
I guess its all part of the plan

[Outro - ERA]

Now, If you're still unaware of what our purpose is
Well, what we seek after, is everything.Embed
