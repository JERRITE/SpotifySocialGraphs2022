Drop It Low (Fatman Scoop Mix) LyricsDrop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around
Drop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around
Drop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around
Drop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around

Move your body baby, bom bom bom
When I shake it, I'mma steal-a the show
Come one baby, run run run
Quiero eso, dale long long long
Whine up, baby, whine, whine, whine
Take it slow, do it one more time
Feel it up, perfect moment la cool-a
Feel it up, like tomorrow, tomorrow
Feel it up, you never forget it
I'mma see you looking it at me
Oh my my sexy boy
Uno, dos, tres
Dale... Move you body!

Drop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around

Pop it up, pop it up, turn around
Drop it low
Pop it up, pop it up, turn around

Move your body baby, round, round, round
Make it happen, then show it around
Shake your booty, make it pow, pow, pow
Turn around, keep it coming for more-a
Break a sweat, he'll be back in for more-a
Hold my body like a coca cola
Move your body, baby take me ahora
Come to me, cuz you like my sabor-a
