1234 x (Extended Version) LyricsIntro: [Insolent Myth]
Um, (One)
Hello, (Two)
Cassie, (Three)
You still there, (Four)
Oh f**k, (X)
(Are you over me yet?)

Verse 1: [Insolent Myth]
Cassie
We need to talk
You were all I could think about for so f**king long
I’m not mad
Just f**kin’ sad
Since a couple weeks ago I felt horribly bad
You should’ve seen me
My arms were bleeding
It was you I attempted forgetting
I’m not kidding
I was constantly thinking of ending it
So right now everything I’ve been thinking I’m venting it
Are you even alive I’m f**king losing my sh*t
I almost put a gun to my head
I kinda wish I was dead
I almost hung myself by my neck
I kinda just want you back
Verse 2: [Insolеnt Myth]
I’m needing you more than ever
Communications arе severed
I’m never gonna feel better
I’m using music as a letter
For you to know
That without you I’m alone
Dad can I have back my phone
Cuz I think after a few more songs I’m about to be gone
Gone to Hell
Can’t you tell
I’m depressed
F**ked in the head
I know everyone’s pain and I just wish that I was dead
Should I fill my head with lead or put a knife in my chest
I’ve met tons of girls but nevertheless you were always the best
A little bit of me
Is the monster I don’t won’t to be
My knife has blood dripping from the tip and I’m shaking vigorously
Seriously my life is going to end miserably
I’m cutting continuously
I hate school and just sit here obliviously
My teachers teach ignorantly
I’m needing more therapy
At night it’s hard to breathe
My happiness is broken now and all I do is worry
I’ve been grounded for so long just put me in the ground dead
I’m scared to do it myself
(Somebody tell me there’s there a lighter side of hell)

Verse 5 [Roxy]:
F**k it
It’s all over
I’m ending my life as soon as I see another razor
Am I insane?
Yeah I guess
I’m a little f**ked in the head
I’m probably better off dead
You’d be surprised at how much blood I shed
Why does every guy gotta be such a d**khead
(Epic Guitar Solo)
I lost the perfect one
My only shot at love
What have I f**king done?!
I’m so f**king dumb

(OH MY F**KING GOD!)

Bad thoughts have just begun
Where are they coming from?!
I’m obsessed with knives and guns
I cut my wrist just for fun
(YEAH!)

Refrain 3: [Insolent Myth and Roxy]
F**K THIS! (F**K LIFE!)
LOVE IS DEAD! (I’M NOT ALIVE!)
LOVE IS HATE! (I SHOULDN’T OF TRIED!)
ESCAPE THROUGH CUTS! (HAND ME MY KNIFE!)

(*Screaming*)  (*Crying*)

I never… (Ever…)
Wanted anybody more… (Than I wanted you…)
Now it hurts… (When I think of you…)
I just want you to know that… (Without you…)
I’m alone… (I’m alone…)
