In The Whataburger Drive Thru Lyrics[Intro 2x]
Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?

[Verse 1]
Never sleepin', barely takin' naps
Niggas beefin' cause the cheddar stacked
Caddy faster than a Hellcat
Make 'em feel the presence and they fell back
I ain't been in the crib
I've been chasin' this gold lust
So I'm movin' around
Focus on and I want it like it's a drug
Got a crib by the town
Stay on the low
Now they ain't try me before, but I'm ready
That's somethin' to know
Deepin' this Jeep four by the four
And I keep a little somethin' to blow off yo (?)
Stay with me hoe
(?)
Eatin', we never ain't gon choke
Niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
They really just blowin' smoke
They whole oral a joke
Tell you the truth, all this shit's a lie
You ain't inhalin', you fakin', I'm high
Stuck on the low and you barely get by
Snappin' and chattin' is wearin' you fly
Cause of that actin', you buried alive
Hope that a piece of yourself can survive
Easy to see when you open yo eyes
Niggas be grown, fallin' victim to pride
Too late, we gone
Pocket be full of that strong
Smokin' this shit all alone
Got to be wary who you gon let in yo home or smokin' yo cone
I got me another, took two to the dome
I tell you I'm zone
Sittin' at home, but nigga I'm gone
Ain't on the plane, but I feel like I flown, uh
[Verse 2]
Comin' up quick
Stunt like I just hit a lick
Yo bitch run to the dick
And she was thick
Tried to have fun when I hit
But she gon run from my shit
Goin' too hard
Fuck it, you only live once
And I always be talkin' to God
Stay level headed when I'm doin' bidness with frauds
Always be dodgin' the laws
I'm like a boss
In another level, I’m up
Used to be all on the bus
Now I just ride through the night with three hoes on my truck
Took out the top, nigga what?
Smoke in the air
Let the wind blow on they hair
Way that I play isn't fair
Takin' it there
This type of player is rare
Hatin', I'm too blessed to care
Took me a minute
I figured it out
Really I'm 'bout it, this shit they 'bout
Really be livin' the life that they rap
Only the (?) and I might get my trap
When she with me, she switchin’ the style
She a chameleon
These bitches is wild
Got her some Stussy and rockin’ the Vans
Tellin’ her partner that I was her man
Bitch you a lie
What is you high?
Took me an oath, I’m a pimp ‘til I die
Bout to get ghost, I’ll be back in July
Doin’ the most with the tears in your eye
(?) blind
Know I’m one of a kind
Nothin’ you never gon find
Only repeatin’ myself when you pressin' rewind
Ain’t with the wastin’ the time, nah

Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?
Do you wanna to get high?Embed
