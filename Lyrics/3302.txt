Menace Lyrics[Intro]
8-8-8-808 Mafia

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & Quavo]
Go and bust it open, go ahead baby, get naked
Know you got a nigga but I wanna see you get naked
Deepthroat, deepthroat, baby go ahead, take it
Nigga on the strip, bought a bitch while he in Vegas
Say you gettin' money but the whole world know you fakin', uh (Yea)
Move with the quickness
Flex so hard had to invest in fitness
Everybody think when you rich you can fix shit
Shit ain't broke 'less you broke, that's some real shit (Yeah)
I can send my whole family to college now
Rap nigga mad 'cause his father never came around
My lil' brother J A1, know he stayed down
He'll knock the tooth off a nigga if they talk down (Yeah)
That's right, knock your tooth if you talk loose
Bitch givin' neck, deep throat like a white goose
(Ahah, yeah)
[Chorus: Quavo]
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out, moshpit
(Moshpit, moshpit, moshpit, yeah)
Wrap 'em up, wrap 'em up, hold 'em up for hostage
(wrap 'em up, wrap 'em up, wrap 'em up, yeah)
Just bought a coupe and the interior ostrich
(ostrich, ostrich, ostrich, yeah)
Walk in the bank, got a mil to deposit (cash)
Hundred thousand dollars on the neckpiece, flex piece
Hundred thousand dollars on the walkthrough, check, please
I made the sauce and they ran with the recipe (Sauce)
Ran with the recipe (ran)
All of my bitches treat me like Bill Bellamy (Player)
Treat me like Bill Bellamy (Player)
I'm on the couch and I'm posted like Ellen be (Ellen, yeah)
Posted like Ellen be (E)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Big dog, pull up in the quick frog (Big dog)
Matte black, inside eggnog
Smokin' on Biscotti, smellin' like a wet dog (Ooh)
I never wanna go back to a rec call (no)
Lamborghini pullin' up, this not a Vette dog (Skrt)
Get the dope and chop it up and then finesse y'all (Hey)
Wide body, wide hips on Bentayga
Inside red like the candy LifeSavers
Lookin' at the 'Tek on my wrist, icebreaker
