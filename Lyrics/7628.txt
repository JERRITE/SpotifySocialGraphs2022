Boss Bitch Lyrics[Intro: Ashnikko]
Na na na na
Na na na na na

[Verse 1: Brooke Candy]
I'm a, I'm a boss bitch, I'm a boss, bitch
I steal a fuck boy, take him hostage
Break his back, make him eat his own sausage
I'm a boss bitch, I'm a boss, bitch
And he's never gonna kiss me where my lip gloss is
Find his cute face missin' on a milk carton
Pay the ransom, price going up, Branson
See me dancin', money lookin hella handsome
[Pre-Chorus: Ashnikko & Brooke Candy]
I'm the CEO, see you later, I don't need it (Bye)
Spaghettio in my bowl, best believe it
Three strikes and you're out like Adidas
On the telephone, dial tone, hear him breathin'

[Chorus: Ashnikko & Brooke Candy]
Started from the ground up (Boss bitch)
Get my dollars and my pounds up (I'm a boss bitch)
Dominating all these little boys
I'ma shout it, make the biggest noise
Started from the ground up (Boss bitch)
Get my dollars and my pounds up (I'm a boss bitch)
Dominating all these little boys
I'ma shout it, make the biggest noise

[Post-Chorus: Ashnikko & Brooke Candy]
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a boss bitch)
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a, I'm a boss)

[Verse 2: Brooke Candy]
Hand down my pants on my pussy, I'm a boss bitch
Throw my panties in the crowd, make a mosh pit
Stringing him along like a cross-stitch
If there's a line, I'ma sure as hell cross it
It's Britney, bitches, and I'm toxic
Stick with me, kid, to pull a profit
Dip with me, flip and do a drop kick
I flip the script, I'm in the cockpit

I'm the CEO, see you later, I don't need it (Dolla)
Spaghettio in my bowl, best believe it
Three strikes and you're out like Adidas
On the telephone, dial tone, hear him breathin'

[Chorus: Ashnikko & Brooke Candy]
Started from the ground up (Boss bitch)
Get my dollars and my pounds up (I'm a boss bitch)
Dominating all these little boys
I'ma shout it, make the biggest noise
Started from the ground up (Boss bitch)
Get my dollars and my pounds up (I'm a boss bitch)
Dominating all these little boys
I'ma shout it, make the biggest noise

[Post-Chorus: Ashnikko & Brooke Candy]
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a boss bitch)
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a boss)
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a boss bitch)
Na na na na (Boss bitch)
Na na na na na (I'm a boss)Embed
