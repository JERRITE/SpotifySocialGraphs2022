We got to get all of it, my nigga, what the fuck you mean?
Man, it get so heavy like a motherfucking Chevy (and)

Niggas on the corner banging every damn thing (and)
Watch your fucking back, and who the fuck you talk to man?

The real, my nigga, they'll kill my nigga (and)
Peel you, my nigga, then they'll peel, my nigga (and)
Squeal, my nigga, and you will be killed, bruh (and)
