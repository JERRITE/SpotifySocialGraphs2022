Uniform of Youth LyricsI don't think I like this place, I don't think I like your face
I don't know if I'll stick around, I don't know I just might leave town
I don't care much what people say, nothing's perfect anyway
No one said that the world was fair, all I want is someone to care

Chorus:
I wear the uniform of youth and I hold on
I wear the uniform of youth and I hold on

Dress it up, play it down, take it out, kick it around
Never mind that I'm not like you, I'll just do what I've got to do
(chorus)
I wear the uniform of youth and I hold on
Yeah, just hold on

(Solo)

(chorus)
Yeah, just hold on
I wear the uniform of youth, gotta hold on, oh!You might also likeEmbed
