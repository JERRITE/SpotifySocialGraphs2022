No Money To Love You LyricsCause I don't got shit
And my life is a lie
I wake up everyday
Put on a person disguise
Who am I when standing in it?
Who am I? just wait one minute!

Cause...
Money rules the world
But people make it happen
People make it happen
Cause the people gotta have it
People gotta have it
Cause the people got a habit
And the people got a habit
But they judge a crack addict
$2000 on some mediocrе booze
You work 80 hours for some fucking foam shoes
Look what thеse rich folks
Making you do
Look what these rich folks
Doin' to you...you got
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody-body-body
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody
Got nobody-body-body
Got nobody

Nobody to love
Nobody to love you
You got no money
And nobody to pray to
No money for love
No money to love you
I got no money
And nobody to pray to
Cause I don't got shit
And my life is a lie
Wake up everyday
Put on a person disguise
Who am I when standing in it?

But I don't got shit
And my life is a lie
I wake up everyday

Who am I? Just wait one minute!
Am I a villain?
