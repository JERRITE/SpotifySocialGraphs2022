I Donâ€™t Wanna Be Alone Lyrics[Verse 1: James Fauntleroy]
I was driving, and dozing off
Didn't mean to miss your calls
Where's the volume on this fucking phone?
I don't wanna be alone
Now you ain't picking up
I'm thinking about getting up
But I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus : James Fauntleroy]
And neither do you, baby
It's too crazy, How I call a million times
I just had a million things on my mind
It's you, baby
Almost had a million and one this time
[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
But I was busy, and dozing off
Fucking 'round, missing calls
Know that I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
And neither do you, baby
I've been calling for so long
Like since two, babe
And now it's five
"Are you cool, babe?
It's been a hundred thousand times, I hit you, babe
"Are you alive?", And then I got a text reply:

[Hook]
Saying you were sorry for dozin' off
Didn't mean to miss my calls
And you don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
And neither do I, baby
If I saw you right here, right now, babe
I would throw the guitar right down, baby
If I saw you right here, right now, baby
But every time I lie down
You might also like[Hook]
Is when I start dozing off
Even when I'm playing the guitar
Singing "I don't wanna be alone"


[Chorus]
And neither do you, baby
It's too crazy, How I call a million times
I just had a million things on my mind
It's you, baby
Almost had a million and one this time6Embed
