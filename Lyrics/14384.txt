A Sadness Runs Through Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
People are puppets held together with string
There's a beautiful sadness that runs through him
As he asks me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in

[Verse 2]
Time and again, boys race to be men
Impatient they start, fearful they end
But here was a man mourning tomorrow
He drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, he could not break surface tension
He looked in the wrong place for redemption

[Chorus]
Don't look at me with those eyes
I tried to anaesthetize
Turn back the time that drew him
But he couldn't be saved
A sadness runs through him, through him

[Verse 2]
Time and again, boys race to be men
Impatient they start, fearful at the end
But here was a man mourning tomorrow
Who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, he could not break surface tension
He looked in the wrong place for redemption

[Chorus]
Don't look at me with those eyes
I tried to anaesthetize
Turn back the time that drew him
But he couldn't be saved
A sadness runs through him, through him

Don't look
Don't look
Don't, don't

[Chorus]
Don't look at me with those eyes
I tried to unheave
Turn back the time that drew him
But he couldn't be saved
No, he couldn't be saved
A sadness runs through him (Through him)
A sadness runs through him (Through him)
A sadness runs through him (Through him)
A sadness runs through him (Through him)
A sadness runs, sadness runs through him10Embed
