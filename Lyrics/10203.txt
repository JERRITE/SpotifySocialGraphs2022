Whenever He Asks Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been staying in
I've been getting high
Already broke down twice
Damn it, he looks so nice
So nice, his

[Pre-Chorus]
His curly hair gets in the way when we're kissing
Way when we're kissing
I would meet him halfway if something wasn't missing
Something wasn't missing, but
[Chorus]
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them

[Verse 2]
I've been taking hits
I've been doing time
Dare me to lose my mind
Don't have to ask me twice
Me twice, his

[Pre-Chorus]
His curly hair gets in the way when we're kissing
Way when we're kissing
Thought if I gave it space, then I could go on living
I could go on living, but

[Chorus]
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them

[Bridge]
Every time that I'm in his bed
I feel emptier than if I had left
Wanted a home, but I'm just a guest
Thought I was different, I'm just like the rest
Every time that I'm in his bed
I feel emptier than if I had left
Think that he wants the person he met
He's taken it all, there's not much of her left
You might also like[Chorus]
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them
I still give him my nights
Whenever he asks, ever he asks for them1Embed
