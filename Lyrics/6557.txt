Leave a Light On (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursin' through your veins
Now I know, it's got ahold
Just a phone call left unanswered, had me sparkin' up
These cigarettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are
Don't let go, keep ahold

[Pre-Chorus]
If you look into the distance, there's a house up on the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way…
[Chorus]
I will leave a light on
I will leave a light on
I will leave a light on
I will leave a light on

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's been happenin', what's been on your mind
Lately, you've been searchin' for a darker place
To hide, that's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if you look into the distance, there's a house up on the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way…

[Chorus]
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

'Cause if you look into the distance, there's a house up on the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
If you've lost your way...
If you've lost your way…

And I know you're down and out now, but I need you to be brave
Hidin' from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay
I see your pain; if you don't feel our grace
And you've lost your way…
I will leave a light on
I will leave the light on
And I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on1Embed
