Watchu Like Lyrics[Chorus: Rah Swish & DreamDoll]
Tell me what you like (Woo, woo)
But baby, I need you to keep it discreet
They shouldn't know what we do in these sheets
You can't fuck with them if you fuckin' with me
Got her on ice (Woo)
You know her diamonds they come with two V's
My Mona Lisa, she somethin' to see
She actin' up then I fuck her to sleep
You know what I like
I be talkin' my shit but you know I can fight (Woo)
New bust down, no keys to my house
Fresh front too don't pull on my scalp (Hmm-mm)
He be treatin' me right (Woo, woo)
I tell him he better talk to me nice (Talk to me, talk to me)
Or don't talk to me twice (No)
[Verse 1: Rah Swish]
My new McLaren, Pop Smoke blue (Woo)
I bought a chain for my whole crew (Woo)
Thom Browne sweat suits got those too (Look)
I keep a stick when I roll through
Follow suit, high pursuit
Was on your body when I saw you
I heard you was a bad girl (Bad girl)
I wanna know what bad girls do
What's your name? (Where you from?)
What's your panty size?
Lord knows, that she make a nigga fantasize
Baby girl I'm 6'1", I'm a stand up guy
If you stuck with a clown push your  man aside
She feelin' the woo (Woo), I stick and move
I got some shit to get her in the mood (Yeah)
I want it my way, she do what I say
She want a baby with me off the Clas√©

[Chorus: Rah Swish & DreamDoll]
Tell me what you like (Woo, woo)
But baby, I need you to keep it discreet
They shouldn't know what we do in these sheets
You can't fuck with them if you fuckin' with me
Got her on ice (Woo)
You know her diamonds they come with two V's
My Mona Lisa, she somethin' to see
She actin' up then I fuck her to sleep
You know what I like
I be talkin' my shit but you know I can fight (Woo)
New bust down, no keys to my house
Fresh front too don't pull on my scalp (Hmm-mm)
He be treatin' me right (Woo, woo)
I tell him he better talk to me nice (Talk to me, talk to me)
Or don't talk to me twice (No)

How niggas be up on my body it's crazy (Woo)
I gotta block me a hoe nigga daily
He said this pussy is wet like the navy
I told 'em, "You know my bop like DaBaby"
I'm from the Bronx so you know how I'm comin' (Uh)
Dream is the trip gotta pay me in luggage (Yeah)
Ice on my wrist, boy, I'm cooler than runnings (Woo)
I'm fine like a summons, I got it but bitches don't want it
He get an attitude when he don't see me (Ha)
I get this pussy poppin' on his beanie
He wanna eat me out, that nigga greedy (Hmm)
He wanna fly me out inside Tahiti (Woo)
He know how I like it (Ha), he'd do whatever to wife it (Yeah)
He good with the head, he a psychic (Ha)
He talk to you nice but to me he the nicest

[Chorus: Rah Swish & DreamDoll]
