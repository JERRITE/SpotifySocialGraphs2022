Itâ€™s Been a Long Time Since You Said That You Missed Me Lyrics[Intro: Smrtdeath]
Damn, that's surreal right there?
You only come around when it's easy

[Verse 1: Smrtdeath]
You only come around when it's easy
Take a photograph to say look we're back again
But you won't carry much around on those cold shoulders
And I've been tying knots and rope it seems I'm at the end
Wrote you a message but it turned to letters
The letters got too long so I just let them burn away
Can't fit all these emotions one piece of paper
A name that meant so much that sometimes it still hurts to say
[Hook: Smrtdeath]
And now you're holding my hand
But I won't make amends
Cause I don't know who I am
And in my defense it's been a long time
Since you said that you missed me
Been a long time
Since you said that you miss me
Now you're holding my hand
But I won't make amends
Cause I don't know who I am
And in my defense it's been a long time
Since you said that you missed me
Been a long time
Since you said that you miss me

[Verse 2: Smrtdeath]
You left me behind and I could see you from a distance
Shut the windows and the blinds and let no one else inside
Used to wrap your arms around me in the coldest nights of winter For a moment it be fine but that moment's not this time
'Cause time passed, you gotta let it go
To see [?] and leave me on my own
You don't want, boy you just want moan
And then I'll be back all alone again

[Hook: Smrtdeath]
And now you're holding my hand
But I won't make amends
Cause I don't know who I am
And in my defense it's been a long time
Since you said that you missed me
Been a long time
Since you said that you miss me

You said that we'd be fine but are we really?
See we don't ever talk and so my head it hurts again
At times I feel compelled to rip my heart from my chest
I settle for distractions that will help my day to end
It all it leads back to you
Don't act like you're surprised
My baby is a star and a cool lover in disguise
Yeah she keeps everything in, and in her mouth full of lies
But I love her, yeah I love her, I don't care if she is mine

[Hook: Smrtdeath]
And now you're holding my hand
But I won't make amends
Cause I don't know who I am
And in my defense it's been a long time
Since you said that you missed me
Been a long time
Since you said that you miss me2Embed
