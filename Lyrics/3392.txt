Safety 2020 Lyrics[Intro: GASHI]
Oh, oh no no, oh
Mally Mall

[Verse 1: GASHI]
Sometimes, don't wanna fall in love 'cause I'm sick of lies (Sick of lies)
When you not around, all I got is tears in my eyes (In my eyes)
Mama praying, saying, "Boy, that you'll be fine"
You're the first and the last thing that's always on my mind

[Chorus: GASHI & Chris Brown]
I need you to come over and save me now
Tell 'em all that you love me now
Please don't you ever put me down
Make me put this gun down now
I need you to come over and save me
I need to put this gun on safety
I hate that you just said you hate me
I need you come over and save me right now
Oh, I need
[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & GASHI]
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, oh-oh (Oh)
Hey, oh-oh (Oh no, no)
Mally Mall

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Stop takin' shots with me (Oh-oh-oh, shots)
You saw how that plays with me
We should've stay tight, oh-oh-oh
Hold me down on my gravity
You got me sleepin' with the lights on (Lights on)
You got me stressin', what's the outcome?
To ride with me, got my shotgun (Ooh-ooh)
Let it breathe like the ocean
Need your love and devotion
True love just makes it hard (Yes, it does)
Sometimes, you go too far

[Chorus: GASHI, Chris Brown & Both]
I need you to come over and save me (Oh, no, no, no)

I need you come over and save me (I need you), right now (Ooh-ooh)
I need you to come over and save me (Oh, no, no, no)
I need you to put this gun on safety (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I hate that you just said you hate me (No, no)
I need you come over and save me (I need you), right now (Ooh-ooh)
