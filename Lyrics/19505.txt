Dose of Reality Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Let’s take it back to ‘99
When I was just a kid | and everything was just fine | it’s like
I thought I had it all
Then I went and wrote this whole album on Adderall | fuck it though
Nowadays I need a dose of reality
Couple grams of life and a few lines of family
My mom told me this is like some Jackson 5 shit
Well no offense to you momma but this is my shit, they love it
I did it all without a budget
How come one day she love me and the next she saying  fuck it I know
I got my head up when I’m walking ‘round, smiling now
Go and call me Kanye cause they can’t tell me nothing now
And I don’t know what perfect is
But we could be the definition if you let me in (yeah)
And it’s a good place to start
Cause there’s a fuck ton of ways to beat a broken heart
So it goes
[Hook: Alex Hall]
My heart is racing and it’s 4am
I don’t know if it’s drugs or I’m in love again
But if you let me I can show you my plan
We can make our own we don’t need all them
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 2]
Let’s take it back to ’08
When I was just in high school and everything was just great
I used to kick it on the field but now I kick it on the stage
And every time I drink I lose my heart but don’t remember names but
Oh well you love and you lust
But I do way more of the latter I got problems with trust
I wanna say something to you without you sounding all sus
I think my game is pretty tight but it’d be tighter with us, I mean
Yeah
And the leads me to today
Where I learned that shortcuts only call for delays
So I just wrote my fucking story out page by page
And it’s a book where typos were not my only mistakes
But I’m young
I mean I’m only 21
So I can rewrite my shit because it’s only begun
And I think
That this a great place to start
Cause there’s a fuck ton of ways to beat a broken heart
Hit it

My heart is racing and it’s 4am
I don’t know if it’s drugs or I’m in love again
But if you let me I can show you my plan
We can make our own we don’t need all them
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Skit]
That's what I'm saying is like I realized...
I just... was worrying about things that I could not possibly control
Whether it'd be today, the future, life
And then I just kind of realized one day that, I mean...
Just, that's the beauty of life
It's completely not knowing what is going to happen tomorrow
'Cause if we knew what was going to happen tomorrow
What... what'll be the point of seeing tomorrow
So I just snapped out of it and realized: 'Wow, this is what being human is like'Embed
