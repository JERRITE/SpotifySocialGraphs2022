Translations한국어RomanizationWOODZ - 안녕이란 말도 함께 (Hope to be like you) (English Translation) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You took it to the limit
We've been enduring enough
I'm fed up again with the long line that repeats every day
If you take a come closer, step back, ah
We didn't want to be one, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
That endearing expression
The expression that you're working hard on again
Stop it, that's not you
I just want to say "love you, goodbye"
[Chorus]
We say "hello!" together
I'll remember if I ever meet you
So that I can pass by pretending I didn't know it
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (You, you)

[Verse 2]
You're the only one but I'll let you go
I really love you, I have no choice, no, no
I know I'm the one holding your breath (Ooh-ooh)
My heart is in pain

[Pre-Chorus]
That endearing expression
The expression that you're working hard on again
Stop it, that's not you
I just want to say "love you, goodbye"

[Chorus]
We say "hello!" together
I'll remember if I ever meet you (Ooh-ooh)
So that I can pass by pretending I didn't know
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (You, you)

We look so beautiful (Ooh)
I have a lot of precious memories (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Thank you, I know you really loved me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's okay

[Chorus]
We say "hello!" together
I'll remember if I ever meet you
So that I can pass by pretending I didn't know it
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (Ah, ah, ah)
I hope to be like you (You, you)Embed
