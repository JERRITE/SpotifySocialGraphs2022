Dammit Janet Lyrics[Brad Majors]
Hey, Janet

[Janet Weiss]
Yes, Brad?

[Brad Majors]
I've got something to say

[Janet Weiss]
Uh huh?
[Brad Majors]
I really love the...skillful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet

[Janet Weiss]
Oh...oh, Brad

[Brad Majors]
The river was deep but I swam it
[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
The future is ours, so let's plan it

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
So please don't tell me to can it

[Chorus]
Janet
You might also like[Brad Majors]
I've one thing to say, and that's
Dammit Janet, I love you
The road was long but I ran it


[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
There's a fire in my heart and you fan it

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
If there's one fool for you then I am it

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
I've one thing to say, and that's
Dammit Janet, I love you
Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker
There's three ways that love can grow
That's good, bad, or mediocre
Oh J-A-N-E-T, I love you so
[Janet Weiss]
Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had

[Chorus]
Oh, Brad

[Janet Weiss]
Now we're engaged and I'm so glad

[Chorus]
Oh, Brad

[Janet Weiss]
That you met Mom and you know Dad

[Chorus]
Oh, Brad

[Janet Weiss]
I've one thing to say, and that's
Brad, I'm mad, for you too
Oh, Brad

[Brad Majors]
Oh, dammit

[Janet Weiss]
I'm mad

[Brad Majors]
Oh, Janet

[Janet Weiss]
For you

[Brad Majors]
I love you too

[Brad and Janet]
There's one thing left to do, ah-hoo

[Brad Majors]
And that's go see the man who began it

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
When we met in his science exam-it

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
Made me give you the eye and then panic

[Chorus]
Janet

[Brad Majors]
Now I've one thing to say, and that's
Dammit Janet, I love you
Dammit, Janet


[Janet Weiss]
Oh Brad, I'm mad

[Brad Majors]
Dammit, Janet

[Brad and Janet]
I love you2Embed
