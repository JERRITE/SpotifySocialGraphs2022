Narcissistic Teen Makes First XI Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll never really understand why I believe you
You're so sly and underhand I think I'll leave you
And everything I stole since we met â€”
I stole no kisses, just some books and the odd cigarette

[Chorus 1]
It's raining
And now it's sunny

[Verse 2]
Oh well you scuppered all my best-laid plans
I can't believe you
You dismissed my pleas right out of hand
I can't believe you
You listed everything I stole since we met
But I stole no kisses, just some books and a butterfly net
[Chorus 2]
It's raining
And now it's sunny
I never liked choruses anyway
I never lacked choruses anyway

[Outro]
It's true what they say
It's raining
It's true what they say
Hey, oh!You might also likeEmbed
