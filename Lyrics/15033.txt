Don’t Even Trip Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think you're old enough to know it better
But I'm old enough to remember
(Don't even trip)
I won't use that stupid word forever
Cross your heart and hope to die

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't even trip
Don't get too big for your britches
(Don't even trip)
All these bones been jumping out of your closet
(You're not in your closet yet)
So blasé, don't turn and look the other way
(You wanna be a star)
You wanna be a star, you're oh so near yet oh so far
(Don't even trip)
[Verse 2]
You'll be flyin' south before the winter
On that long, long trip of the sinner
(Don't even trip, don't even trip, don't even trip)
Don't be throwing stones at the mirror
Look in peace and close your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't even trip
Don't get too big for your britches
(Don't even trip)
All these bones been jumping out of your closet
(You're not in your closet yet)
So blasé, don't turn and look the other way
(You gotta have it all)
You gotta have it all, you're oh so near yet oh so far

[Chorus]
And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm here to trim the leaves
And I'm afraid that you're still my friend
And you're just a piece of shit
But I can overlook it today
'Cause you're still my friend

[Verse 3]
Don't even trip
Drop that gun, you ain't my fucking hero
(Don't even trip, don't even trip, don't even trip)
You think it's cool to be a fucking zero?
(Don't even trip, don't even trip, don't even trip)
Can't believe I called you 'mi amigo'
Take a deep breath and you'll be fine
Because
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Speak up now
And one of you is a hundred loud
(When you preach you come off)
When you preach
They'll join you on the roofs and streets
(Like crystal clear)
Crystal clear
I'm hanging like a chandelier
(Watching over you)
Watching over you
I'll move you from song to tears

[Chorus]
And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm gonna trim the leaves
And I can say that you're still my friend
And you're still a piece of shit
But I can overlook it today
'Cause you're still my friend
And I know that assholes grow on trees
But I'm here to trim the leaves
And I'm afraid, are you still my friend?
And you're still a piece of shit
But I can look the other way
'Cause you're still my friend
[Outro]
