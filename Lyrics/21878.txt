Mandolin Moon LyricsEverything changes in the face of the moon
Nighttime's here and you're in full bloom
When you moon me, my luna girl

My feet, two feet from the ground
I'm tastin' colors and I'm seein' sounds
When you take me out of this world

Well I, I count my blessings and hug my luck
Like an old brass penny with two heads up
It's all right if you're late
I just hope that you find your way soon
Shine down, light it up, wash it over
Waitin' 'round for my mandolin moon
Come around 'til the sweet, sweet mornin'
Come along, I'll be waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

You pull the tides up around me
So much that it could drown me
And you surround me, my luna girl

Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear
Wake me up before you disappear
Won't you take me out of this world?

Well I count my blessings and hug my luck
Like an old brass penny with two heads up
It's all right if you're late
I'd just hope that you find your way soon

Shine down, light it up, wash it over
Waitin' 'round for my mandolin moon
Come around 'til the sweet, sweet mornin'
Come along, I'll be waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I'm waitin', still waitin'
If only you could stay a while
I'm waitin', still waitin'
If only you could stay a while
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
If only you could stay a while
You might also likeShine down, light it up, wash it over
Waitin' 'round for my mandolin moon
Come along 'til the sweet, sweet mornin'
Come along I'll be waiting for you

Shine down, light it up, wash it over
Waitin' 'round for my mandolin moon
Come around 'til the sweet, sweet mornin'
Come along, I'll be waitin' for you

Shine down, light it up, wash it over
Waitin' 'round for my mandolin moon
Shine down, light it up nowEmbed
