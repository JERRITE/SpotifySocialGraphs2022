Out Like a Light Lyrics[Chorus]
Take me uptight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
If I betrayed our lonely nights
Spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
We never fight, when I'm away

[Verse]
Did your mother always seem to hate me?
I'm sicker every day and now I'm terrified of talking to my friends only to stay stuck
Dreaming of our first born and your hair covered in popcorn
You never leave, you never leave, you never leave
[Chorus]
You leave me uptight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
If I betrayed our lonely nights
Spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we never fight when I'm away?You might also like14Embed
