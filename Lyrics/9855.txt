Intermission Lyrics[Interlude: Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown & JaVale McGee]
What's good? This Dame Lillard AKA Dame D.O.L.L.A. checking in
You are now tuned in to Floor Seats II, you feel?
Yo Ferg, this J.B.Â 
My mindset is totally different
Mentally, physically, I'm on a whole 'nother level from y'all niggas
Floor Seats II, you know the vibes
It's JaVale McGee AKA Pierre 2X
Only guy in the league winning championships and producing music at the same damn time
Shout out to my guy A$AP Ferg and shout out to Floor Seats II, go crazyYou might also likeEmbed
