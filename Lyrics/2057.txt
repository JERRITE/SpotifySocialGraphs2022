Are We Good Lyrics[Bridge: Jazzy]
What I have to say, you gon' hear it now
Messing with my day, I'mma stand my ground
People change, I ain't losing sleep
I'mma brush it off, that's just me

[Post-Bridge: Jazzy]
I'mma brush it off, that's just me
Yeah, I'mma brush it off, that's just me, me
Yeah, I'mma brush it off, off, that's just me
[Verse 1: Lauren & (Natasha)]
Text and you don't hit me back
(What? Don't hit me back)
Tell me baby, now what's up with that?
(What's up with that? What's up with that, that?)
You're playin' like you're on the fence
Did you consider the consequence
(Consequences)

[Pre-Chorus: Jazzy]
Pull up your card, it's a facade
I don't recognize you, babe
You're faking a smile, that it's in your eyes
That you feel some type of way

[Chorus: Natasha]
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
If we got a problem, better make a choice
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
Are we, are we, are we, are we

[Post-Chorus: Lauren & Jazzy & (Natasha)]
Are we good?
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)
Are we good?
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)
'Cause I can't read your mind
No more wasting my time, so tell me
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)

Did your momma not teach you no class?
(Teach you no class)
Ain't nobody got time for that
(No time for that, ain't no time for that, no)
You're talking and talking your friends
(Talking and talking and talking it up)
Are we good or should I come again?

[Pre-Chorus: Jazzy]
Pull up your card, it's a facade
I don't recognize you, babe
You're faking a smile, that it's in your eyes
That you feel some type of way

[Chorus: Natasha]
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
If we got a problem, better make a choice
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
Are we, are we, are we, are we

[Post-Chorus: Lauren & Jazzy & (Natasha)]
Are we good?
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)
Are we good?
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)
'Cause I can't read your mind
No more wasting my time, so tell me
(Are we, are we good? Are we, are we good?)

[Chorus: Natasha]
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
If we got a problem, better make a choice
Get to the bottom, get straight to the point
