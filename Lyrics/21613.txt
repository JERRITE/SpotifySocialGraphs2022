You Canâ€™t Rush Your Healing Lyrics[Verse 1]
It comes to me upon the strings
When I hear it, well, I sing
I can't say it's my creations
Staying patient what it brings
Let me say I'm coming humble
I don't know what's right or wrong
I just keep, keep on believin'
Passing down an old, old song
An old song
[Verse 2]
Well everybody's got that chapter
Of dark and darker days, yeah
Saturn seems to be returning
And his essence can't be tamed
Some may like to fight it
Try to plan a secret attack
But the more you push it
The more it's pushin' you back

[Chorus]
So, you can't rush your healing
Darkness has its teachings
Love is never leaving
You can't rush your healing
Your healing

[Verse 3]
Mama, well she told me time is such a wonderful gift
You're not running out
You're really running in
Confusion clouds the heart but it also points the way
Quiet down the mind
The more the song will play

[Chorus]
So, you can't rush your healing
Darkness has its teachings
Love is never leaving
You can't rush your healing
Your healing
Your healing
Your healing
Your healing
You might also like[Outro]
You can't rush your healing
Darkness has its teachings
Love is never leaving
You can't rush your healing1Embed
