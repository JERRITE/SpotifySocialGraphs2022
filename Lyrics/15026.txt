Me, Myself & My Microphone Lyrics[DMC]
Yes y'all, Uptown
The sound, is shakin into war
And for all y'all, this is it

I'm never alone, I'm in a zone and stoned
I never leave home without my microphone
I break backbones like a stone, I roam
I knick knack paddy wack and give a dog a bone
Like Al Capone I am a dog, I foam
At the mouth, shout it out when I groan in tone
I go Uptown, I come back home
(With who?) "Me, myself and my microphone"
[Hook: (x4)]
I go Uptown, I come back home with who?
"Me, myself and my microphone"

[DJ Run]
It's like this y'all, it don't stop
You see I'm Uptown and rockin the dope spot
So I dip to the dive, thrive and come alive
The two MCs that make ya name survive
For alla y'all, my name is Run
I rock big parties, have big fun
The mind blowin, body rockin MC fiend
Who came along and made his home and chained the toll on my team
The cool calm brother from around the way
Where I'm from, DJ Run met a kid named "Jay"
We go Uptown, and come back home
(With who?) "Me, myself and my microphone"

[Hook: x4]
[Bridge: Living Colour (x4)]
Gotta gotta gotta gotta keep it on
Gotta gotta gotta keep it on

[DMC]
"Give us respect"
Get much respect when I flex my TEC
Unique when I speak and wreck your set
I used to take the train to go to school
The microphone holdin on the golden rule
Pop pop pop, you can't stop my flow
I rock it in my pocket everytime I go
Straight Uptown, I come back home
(With who?) "Me, myself and my microphone"
