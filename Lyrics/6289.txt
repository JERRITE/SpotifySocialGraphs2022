Babylon Lyrics[Directed by SZA & APLUSFILMZ]

[Refrain]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1: SZA]
I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?
[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon
You might also like[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Refrain: SZA]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 3: SZA]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me
