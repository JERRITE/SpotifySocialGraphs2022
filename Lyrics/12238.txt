Darkest Part Lyrics[Verse 1]
You track the doubts of my soul
Until you found it
The darkened room locked away
I let you in
You looked inside then you turned away
My makeshift savior
He left me right here in my chains
But still I whisper
Still I call you
[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me

[Verse 2]
It’s my descent
To know your pain
It’s watching all
I believed fade away
Of traitors and fools
Of beggars and thieves
Which mask will you choose
What is underneath

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm the black stain of your perfect life
And I'm the darkness that you need to hide
It covers you
It spills over you

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me9Embed
