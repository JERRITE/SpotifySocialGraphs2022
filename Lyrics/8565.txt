Living on My Own Lyrics[Intro]
Dee do, dee do day
Dee do, dee do, dee do, dee do, day, oh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry
(so lonely)
Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time
I get lonely, so lonely, living on my own

Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast
(so lonely)
And everything is coming down on me, down on me, I go crazy
Oh so crazy, living on my own
[Chorus]
Dee do de, de, dee do de, de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de, de, dee do de, de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning
Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dreamworld
It's not easy, living on my own, my own, my own

[Chorus]
Dee, do de, de (lonely), dee do de, de (lonely)
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de, de, dee do de, de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

[Bridge]
C'mon baby

[Chorus]
Dee do de, de, dee do de, de
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do de, de, dee do de, de
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Got to be some good times ahead
