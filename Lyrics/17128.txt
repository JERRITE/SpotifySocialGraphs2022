Caterpillars to Butterflies Lyrics[Intro]
(Mark is on his way, boy)
You know like
I need therapy
Someone to talk to
(Gari, chop that shit up)
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
One false move could make you lose it all
Been crossed so many times it'll make you sit there and question your dawg
Lookin' how your exes did you
Should make you look at the next bitch different
A broken heart will make you question your decisions
They all say I'm changing I'm starting to let the money control me
They hating on my success they want me to go back to that old me
Love me forevеr that's what they told me
Find out their intеntions were unpure that shit done broke me
[Hook]
Caterpillars turn to butterflies (Butterflies)
Nobody isn't there when its time to ride (When it's time to ride)
Nobody ever showed up when it's time to cry (When it's time to cry)
Realizing you the only one by your side (Oh oh oh)
They steady screaming, "I'm the chosen child" (Chosen child)
I'm having anxiety attacks I'm shutting everyone out
Sick and tired of being told lies (Told lies)
Cause life full of hurt and I don't know why (And I don't know why)

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, I just need some therapy
But when it's time to open up, I close in deeply
I'm learning life at first chance no one to lecture me
When I be home be fighting my thoughts, can't seem to get sleep
Everyone they see me strong, inside I feel so weak
I asked the devil can I leave the streets? He said I'm in too deep (He said no)
For everyone of my niggas I just hope they don't catch a side of envy
Don't focus on today, it's just the beginning
I'm trying hard to escape before it's way too late
My momma stressin' on my feelings she know I'm not ok (I'm not ok)
But then I get to smiling and shit, but she can tell by my eyes I just be wanting to break down, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
Caterpillars turn to butterflies (Butterflies)
Nobody isn't there when its time to ride (When it's time to ride)
Nobody ever showed up when it's time to cry (When it's time to cry)
Realizing you the only one by your side (Oh oh oh)
They steady screaming, "I'm the chosen child" (Chosen child)
I'm having anxiety attacks I'm shutting everyone out
Sick and tired of being told lies (Told lies)
Cause life full of hurt and I don't know why (And I don't know why)

Sometimes I feel I be the only one feelin' hurt (I swear)
I was fourteen feelin' pain when I buried my own uncle in the dirt
Watching the pallbearers carry his casket
That's when I know this love not lasting
Last time I seen Quan in that car, next time I saw his face on the shirt
Send my TT on they dying bed, I'm wishing that I died for them (I swear to god)
I keep everything bottled up it's just not helping
She said, "baby I can help you,"
I responded, "I'm so broken baby, maybe in the next life I can heal," (Pray for me)
Mentally, and physically abused reminiscing 'bout my past
Good luck I never had
Relying on my soul
Think it's time to give my soul a break
God please don't let the devil take my soul away (Soul away)

[Hook]

Realizing you the only one by your side (Oh oh oh)
They steady screaming, "I'm the chosen child" (Chosen child)
I'm having anxiety attacks I'm shutting everyone out
Sick and tired of being told lies (Told lies)
Cause life full of hurt and I don't know why (And I don't know why)Embed
