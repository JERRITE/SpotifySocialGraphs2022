Canâ€™t Help Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know him like I want to but I get this feelin'
Oh no, he's incredible
So hard not to think about him, not to catch no feelings
I tried, I can't let him go (let him go)

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, too close and I know I'm not sick now
No, can't help myself (can't help myself)
Woah, so cool and I can't leave him now
Cause he got, he got, he got me so hooked now
[Chorus]
He got that fire that never goes out, never goes out
Yeah, he light up, can't help me now, help me now
I've been fightin', he's something so good, something so good
I can't hide it, can't help me now, help me now

(Can't help me now, can't help me)
(Can't help me now)
(Can't help me now, can't help me)
(Can't help me now)

[Verse 2]
He moves just like smoke and I can't breathe but I don't mind it
So blind when he comes around (comes around)
Yeah, I'm in no use in tryin' to save me now
Oh, no, tell me we won't burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, too close and I know I'm not sick now
No, can't help myself (can't help myself)
Woah, so cool and I can't leave him now
Cause he got, he got, he got me so hooked now

[Chorus]
He got that fire that never goes out, never goes out
Yeah, he light up, can't help me now, help me now
I've been fightin', he's something so good, something so good
I can't hide it, can't help me now, help me now

(Can't help me now)
(Can't help me now, can't help me)
(Can't help me now)

[Bridge]
There's no use in tryin' to save me, don't try to save me
So close to you, nobody could blame me, nobody could blame me

[Chorus]
He got that- that never goes out, never goes out
Yeah, he-, can't help me now, help me now
-he's something so good, something so good
I can't-, can't help me now, help me now8Embed
