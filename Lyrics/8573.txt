Mr. Bad Guy (Special Edition) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's go chasing rainbows in the sky
It's my invitation
Let's all take a trip on my ecstasy

[Chorus 1]
I'm Mr. Bad Guy
Yes I'm everybody's Mr. Bad guy
Can't you see? I'm Mr. Mercury
Oh-oh, spread your wings and fly away with me
[Verse 2]
Your big daddy's got no place to stay
Bad communication
I feel like the President of the USA

[Chorus 2]
Mr. Bad Guy, yes I'm everybody's Mr. Bad Guy
Can't you see I'm Mr. Mercury
Ooh, spread your wings and fly away with me

[Verse 3 to Bridge 1]
I'm Mr. Bad guy, they're all afraid of me
I can ruin people's lives, yeah, yeah
Mr. Bad guy, they're all afraid of me
It's the only way to be
That's my destiny yeah
Mr. Bad Guy, Mr. Bad guy,  Bad Guy

[Bridge 1]
It's the only way for me
It's my destiny, oh yeah, woo!

[Chorus 3]
Mr. Bad guy, yes I'm everybody's Mr. Bad Guy
Can't you see this is my destiny
Ooh, spread your wings and fly away with me
