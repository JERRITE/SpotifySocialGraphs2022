TranslationsFran√ßaisPoltergeist Lyrics[Chorus]
I started all of the wars
I started all of the wars
I've been getting messages from my deep waters
(Call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up)
I'd be a resentful caretaker
Blame me for your false indicators
You mistaken all my mistakes for my crooked nature
(Call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up)

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, I think I saw a ghost
He follow me everywhere I go
He don't even try to get creative
I smell a clown looking goofy dressed up as a native
[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you call me here? You don't even know
Acting like a fool while you mull it over
Make it go away, you won't even know
Baby looking cool smoking on a clover

[Chorus]
I started all of the wars
I started all of the wars
I've been getting messages from my deep waters
(Call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up)
I'd be a resentful caretaker
Blame me for your false indicators
You mistaken all my mistakes for my crooked nature
(Call me up, call me up, call me up, call me up)

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, I think I saw a ghost
Why you here walking around on my home street?
Pardon me
Cut your shoulder, you've been affected
I smell the chemicals, I don't see miracles
I'm at the pinnacle, oh, you're so material
Oh, did ya get your money?

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You mistaken all my mistakes for my crooked nature
