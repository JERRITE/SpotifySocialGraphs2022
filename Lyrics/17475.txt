Wait For You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep you safe when winds are blowing wild
Bring you up when you are feeling down
Like oceans deep, I'll dive into your mind
Steady on the ground I'll be your guide

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you worry, baby
We just gotta learn how to get through the hard times

[Chorus 1]
'Cause when you'll hold me nothing's ever lonely
I will be your only, I will wait for you
And when you're crying wipe your tears and dry 'em
I will get you high again, I will wait for you, I will wait for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[Verse 2]
Don't ever have to feel alone
Anywhere with me will be your home
I'll be there when nothing's come and go
So let me be your had when you feel low

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you worry, baby
We just gotta learn how to get through the hard times

[Chorus 2]
'Cause when you'll hold me nothing's ever lonely
I will be your only, I will wait for you
And when you're crying wipe your tears and dry 'em
I will get you high again, I will wait for you
And when you're falling I will be your savior
Savior from the darkness, I will wait for you
'Cause we keep fighting to get us through the storms
Take our time recovering, I will wait for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you, you, you
I will wait for you, you, you

[Outro]
'Cause when you'll hold me nothing's ever lonely
I will be your only, I will wait for you
And when you're crying wipe your tears and dry 'em
I will get you high again, I will wait for you
I will wait for youYou might also likeEmbed
