Temptationâ€™s Wings Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel the pressure, it lightens
To judge this spirit of mine
To be like the judgment
To be the king that is left behind
To hell with I miss you
I said I'd do it alone
Ripping apart from you
A broken vision to call my own

[Chorus]
I gave my life to reason
So now I'm watching my life go
My wit is falling apart
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings
[Verse 2]
I bury my head with frustration
And I look at others and wonder why
I'm feeding my cancer
A broken vision that stole my sight

[Chorus]
I gave my life to reason
So now I'm watching my life go
My wit is falling apart
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't temptation's wings

[Bridge]
Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings, temptations wings

[Outro]
Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings got me pale
Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings got me pale
Why? Why? Why?
Temptation's wings got me pale
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?You might also likeEmbed
