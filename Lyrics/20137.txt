Dark Matter Lyrics[Intro]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Just 'cause your heart's afraid
Doesn't give the right to say
I was born this way
You see the part you played
All the silhouettes you've made
Flee the light of day
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was innocent in a bad way
But I've found you don't come after soldiers
Unless they were yours in the first place

[Chorus]
Oh, I swim in a violet sea
But I'm bending the light connecting you to me
So write a 'lettre de marque and see
Oh, if this dark matter heart can bleed out right

[Refrain]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
Why do I push away
When your welcome is overstayed?
All I breathe is grey
But through the disarray
You're the emissary vein
To my left right brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause, I wish I was reticent in my own strength
But I've found you don't hold your composure
When I say that with a straight face
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, I swim in a violet sea
But I'm bending the light connecting you to me
So, write a 'lettre de marque' and see
Oh, if this dark matter heart can bleed out right

[Bridge]
See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that'll haunt you
(If I can feel it, why do I need to see it? – Do I?)
See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that'll haunt you
(I don't see it, oh, did I ever feel it? – Did I?)
See, you brought your wits about you
The black bear that'll haunt you

[Chorus]
Swim in a violet sea
But I'm bending the light connecting you to me
So write a ‘lettre de marque' and see
Oh, if this dark matter heart can bleed out right

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)6Embed
