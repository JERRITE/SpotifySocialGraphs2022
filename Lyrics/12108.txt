Starless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sundown dazzling day
Gold through my eyes
But my eyes turned within
Only see

[Chorus]
Starless and
Bible black
[Verse 2]
Old friend charity
Cruel twisted smile
And the smile signals emptiness
For me
[Chorus]
Starless and
Bible black
[Verse 3]
Ice blue silver sky
Fades into grey
To a grey hope that all yearns
To be

[Chorus]
Starless and
Bible black
