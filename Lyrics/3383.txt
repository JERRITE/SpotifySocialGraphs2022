Ainâ€™t My Dog Lyrics[Intro]
(Alek)
I'm sick of showing my life to these niggas, yeah
(Oh yeah)
(Cashout)
I'm sick of, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sick of showing my life to these niggas
I gave it all and I did it myself
Watch how I go when I thump through these figures
Fifties and hundreds, they good for my health
I want it all, you can't get off my vision
Been through it all and I needed no help
You was my dog in the street, but we finished
Paper got right and they switched up and left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
You ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah
How you gon' switch and you see it? You watch me fall, you watch me fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, see I can't fall, see I can't fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, you ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah

[Verse 1]
I put the drop when I jump in the coupe just to flex, no clouds in my diamonds, they wet
Rockin' designer, see Gucci and Louis, my fit Givenchy, I save for the trip
Said she want slow, when she pulled it, she thought I'm a hit, she pop a lot, catching no pics
Send them a polished Dakota, you know how we get
My brother, so why would you switch? Yeah, yeah
Get low, yeah, said I'ma go, this shit clap, oh, yeah
Cop and don't care 'bout the total, yeah, talkin' like they really know, oh, yeah
Mama had told me, "Watch out for them snakes", I just caught a new book like this shit was on stakes
You was my partner, was more like my dog, but this money hit different, know you can relate
I keep it on me, I slide through the hood, see I always just knew that the level was fake
Felt like a pilot, I'm fly with no stylist
The difference of me and them, I cannot wait
Watch when I'm sliding, I push this to start it
This foreign gon' shake 'em up like it's a quake
I'm being honest, they know that I'm 'bout it
See, I run it up 'cause I stay out the way, yeah, yeah
Get low, yeah
You know, you know how we go though, yeah
I get the racks, I be solo, yeah
Way out the guard, I can't go though, yeah
Way out the guard that I get it, the way I be living
'Cause broke is the shit that I feel
Pull up in foreigns, the pack in the back
Got the straps, yeah, I can't let my enemies live

I'm sick of showing my life to these niggas
I gave it all and I did it myself
Watch how I go when I thump through these figures
Fifties and hundreds, they good for my health
I want it all, you can't get off my vision
Been through it all and I needed no help
You was my dog in the street, but we finished
Paper got right and they switched up and left
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah
How you gon' switch and you see it? You watch me fall, you watch me fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, see I can't fall, see I can't fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, you ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah

[Verse 2]
I do for you and you switch up, that partner gon' do it
I might as well do for myself
I know they hate me with love but they love just to hate
So I might as well do with no help
VVS diamonds, my polish is switching
I flooded my neck, that shit look like a well
I've been a hustler, the difference is vivid
How you a real hustler and still you ain't sell?
Nigga swimming like I'm Michael Phelps
Niggas be snake, they try [?] on my wealth
Pull up and pop, but I tell the extendo
Smoking on za, you can tell by the smell
Pull up and pop out, I pulled out the window
I'm full of promise to [?] yourself
Money my safety for life, it ain't simple
Watching these niggas, I kill 'em with stealth
I did enough for these niggas, it's time to get richer
I hate it, shit bad for your health
I lose my partners and all of these niggas
That been coming 'round and they hard just to tell
Say to your brother, see I never trusted him
Say you ain't my dog, so I can't wish you well
Say you my brother, see I never trust you
I can't give you all 'cause I do for myself, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
You ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah
How you gon' switch and you see it? You watch me fall, you watch me fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, see I can't fall, see I can't fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, you ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah
You ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah
How you gon' switch and you see it? You watch me fall, you watch me fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, see I can't fall, see I can't fall, yeah
They wouldn't see when they switch, you ain't my dog, you ain't my dog, yeah1Embed
