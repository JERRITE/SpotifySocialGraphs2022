​​​​saddest soundtrack Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'ma take your smile and turn it upside down
I'ma take the sun and cover it in clouds
I still hear your voice in my head, it's loud
I'll turn up this song, just to drown you out

[Pre-Chorus]
Drown these memories
'Til the bottle's empty
'Cause the feeling's ugly
Hope you hear me now
[Chorus]
Falling in and out of love, turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up, no backup plan for us
Now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back

[Verse 2]
Often, I feel like a ghost 'cause you hauntеd
Every single place that I walk in, I proceed with caution
Block you out, but I still hеar you talkin'
I know when you hear this song, you'll be callin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Drown these memories
'Til the bottle's empty
'Cause the feeling's ugly
Hope you hear me now

[Chorus]
Falling in and out of love, turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up, no backup plan for us
Now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
You might also like[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Falling in and out of love, turned me to the drugs
Feeling like our time is up
And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back
Look at where we ended up, no backup plan for us
Now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call backEmbed
