Fallen So Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
And only a teen when I thought that we could be
It's a sign for you and me
And your eyes so bright like the bluest sea
And I felt like you, you would complete me

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I understand
That this is the start of something new
And now I understand
That it were rare for me and you
And now I understand
That I will always love you
[Chorus]
'Cause darling, I wanna be with you
'Cause baby, our love would always be true
And I'll be waiting for our hearts to be one
And it's rare that I've fallen so young

[Verse 2]
And when I'm with you, yeah I feel so free
And through the dark times, yeah you were my company
There's never lonely days 'cause there's always been you
And from this day, our love would always be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I understand
That this is the start of something new
And now I understand
That it were for me and you
And now I understand
That I will always love you

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, I wanna be with you
'Cause baby, our love would always be true
And I'll be waiting for our hearts to be one
And it's rare that I've fallen so youngYou might also likeEmbed
