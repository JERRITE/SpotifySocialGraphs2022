Hey Believers Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say you walk an open road
Even the blind can walk alone
The road will climb, the road will bend
And every man might see again

[Verse 2]
You say that life's a movie screen
And with the fools who play the scenes
You say that all it takes is love
But you don't know the things I've done
[Chorus]
Hey believers
I'm just a poor man
And I don't believe in what you believe
I'm a stranger
Far from his homeland
And there is no savior that I can see

[Verse 3]
You say you know the destiny
We all live a life of a dream
You say we're bound for better days
But you don't know the price I've paid

[Verse 4]
I guess I'm just a lonely man
Frightened by his empty hands
My feet are stuck here on the ground
And the sky above me is spinnin' round

[Chorus]
Hey believers
I'm just a poor man
And I don't believe in what you believe
I'm a stranger
Far from his homeland
And there is no savior that I can see
You might also like[Outro]
I'm a stranger
Far from his homeland
And there is no savior that I can see
There is no savior that I can seeEmbed
