Scumbag Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Innocence has no resistance
Against a wicked counselor such as I

[Hook]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)

[Verse 2]
Shall I lead you to my parlor?
Poison offers disguised in just your size
[Hook]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
You may think me altruistic
Feel my dark hypnosis closing in

[Hook]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)

[Chorus]
Then you grow cold, cold
As I stare
As if no, none
Could compare
But you don't know
How close, to ensnare
When I control
You will despair

[Hook]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)
You might also like[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 4]
Sycophancy, solipsistic
Spider plays the fool to lure the fly

[Hook]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)

[Chorus]
Then you grow cold, cold
As I stare
As if no, none
Could compare
But you don't know
How close, to ensnare
When I control
You will despairEmbed
