Looking at the Sky With You LyricsI'll stay, I’ll stay here all day
Looking at the sky with you
I'll stay, I'll stay here all day
I’m your daydreaming boy, lilac blue
Were listening to lofi
Say goodbye to the stars
I'll get you the moon
I'll stay, I'll stay here all day

I'll stay, stay here all day
I'm your daydreaming boy, lilac blue
Were listening to lofi
Say goodbye to the stars
I'll get you the moon
I'll stay, stay here all day (Stay here all day)
With you (With you)
I’ll stay, stay here all day (Stay here all day)
(Stay here all day)
(Stay here all day)
I’ll stay, stay here all day
I'm your daydreaming boy, lilac bluе
Were listening to lofi
Say goodbyе to the stars
I’ll get you the moon
I'll stay, stay here all day (Stay here all day)
With you (With you)
I'll stay, stay here all day (Stay here all day)

I'll stay, I’ll stay here all day
Looking at the sky with you
I'll stay, I'll stay here all day
I'm your daydreaming boy, lilac blue
Were listening to lofi
Say goodbye to the stars
I'll get you the moon
I'll stay, I'll stay here all dayYou might also likeEmbed
