There She Goes Lyrics[Chorus]
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain

[Refrain]
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

[Chorus]
There she blows (There she blows again)
There she blows again (There she blows again)
Pulsing through my vein (There she blows again)
[Refrain]
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

[Bridge]
There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name, pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain

[Refrain]
But I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

[Chorus]
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane

[Refrain]
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

[Outro]
There she goes (There she goes again)
There she goes (There she goes again)
There she goes (There she goes again)You might also like11Embed
