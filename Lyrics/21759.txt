Big Wave Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you didn’t wanna be friends
I left you waiting over the weekend
I’m sad, you’re sad

What’s new? You’re dropping out of college
I’m pissed, I wish you were honest, man, man

[Chorus]
And I’m confined to sheds with artificial light
I can see you anywhere I look
With you inside, I’d say things I couldn’t rectify
The world will stay the same
You’re not a book
[Verse 2]
Life sucks, you sounded disappointed
So you packed, left town to Oregon
I’m sad, you’re sad

Thought I saw you sleeping at a bus stop
But I wiped my eyes and you’re not there, there

[Chorus]
And I’m confined to sheds with artificial light
I can see you anywhere I look
With you inside, I’d say things I couldn’t rectify
The world will stay the same
You’re not a book
The world will stay the same
You’re not a book
The world will stay the same
You’re not a bookYou might also likeEmbed
