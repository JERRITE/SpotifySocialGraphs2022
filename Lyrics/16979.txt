River Deep, Mountain High Lyrics[MERCEDES]
When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned

[SANTANA]
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

[MERCEDES]
And it gets stronger, in every way
[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
And it gets deeper, let me say

[MERCEDES]
And it gets higher

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
Day by day
Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah!
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

[SANTANA]
When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?

[MERCEDES]
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
No, I'll never let you down

[MERCEDES]
And it grows stronger, like a river flows
You might also like[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows

[MERCEDES]
And it gets sweeter baby

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
As it grows
Do I love you my oh my?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

[MERCEDES]
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring

[SANTANA]
And I love you baby like the robin loves to sing

[MERCEDES]
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag

[MERCEDES & SANTANA]
And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high

[MERCEDES]
Oh baby
[SANTANA]
Oh baby!

[MERCEDES]
Oh woah baby!

[SANTANA]
Ooh Ooh Ooh!

[MERCEDES]
Ooh Ooh Ooh!

[SANTANA]
Yeah!

[MERCEDES]
Yeah!

[MERCEDES & SANTANA, (SANTANA)]
(Do) I love you my oh my, yeah?
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby1Embed
