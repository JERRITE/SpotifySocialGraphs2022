My Feelings For You (Don Diablo Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see

[Pre-Drop]
My feelings for you have always been real
And after all this time
Tell me, can't you feel?
Tell me, can't you feel?
Tell me, can't you feel?
Tell me, can't you-
Tell me, can't you-
Tell me, can't you feel?
[Drop]
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see
Tell me, can't you-
Tell me, can't you feel?

[Verse 2]
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see

My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see

[Pre-Drop]
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
My feelings for you have always been real
I was so in love with you, I could hardly see
