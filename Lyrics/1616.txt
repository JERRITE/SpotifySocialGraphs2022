It’s About A Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah
Poppin' the same day, wouldn't phase you tomorrow
Not a stranger to excitement
I ain't clockin' you got niggas on the FaceTime calls
But I still hold it down 'cause you know me, yeah
Still hold it down on the regular and lowkey
Still wakin' up to different faces, yeah
She ain't tryna to settle 'cause it's complicated when you not basic

[Chorus]
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not ten
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'cause they're not you
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not tеn
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'causе they're not you
[Verse 2]
Yeah
You in the Range, changin' keys on the regular
You be dubbin' 'em with ease like it's regular
On the ave pullin' G's off the cellular
Then she bring it back to me, I go pick it up
You got the body the price of a Benz and I'm tryna test the shit
You say you got friends, that ain't really friends but you ain't gon' press the shit
You stay in LA but you moved to NY 'cause you don't attach to shit
You walk like a model, you swerved on your ex like you on some Tesla shit, slide
How many niggas can you curve in a night?
Can't fuck with niggas 'cause these niggas kill your vibe
Choosy but you loyal when it's time to pick a side
Options over options can't decide

[Chorus]
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not ten
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'cause they're not you
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not ten
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'cause they're not you

[Verse 3]
And it's somethin' in your vein screamin',, oh yeah
Pixie dust on my hand, she want a taste on the low, uh
Told her, "Baby, I can't feel my face on the low", yeah
Call Coryega, hit the place then we go, uh
Shawty said she lookin' for a Trey, girl, I know
I'm a poppin' nigga (Yeah)
East St. nigga (Yeah)
Please, get the fuck up out my face, lil' nigga, uh
Bitches come and go, I can't relate, lil' nigga
He ain't got no money, girl, replace that nigga
You might also like[Chorus]
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not ten
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'cause they're not you
Poppin' and you're locked in
And you're top ten, but you not ten
Girl, you're top two, but you're not two
And they plottin' 'cause they're not you1Embed
