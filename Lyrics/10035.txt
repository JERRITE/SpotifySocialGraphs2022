If I Had My Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a little bit up
I'm a little bit down
I'm a little bit concerned since you're layin' underground
I'm a little bit high
I'm a little bit low
I feel a bit distant since you're layin' underground

[Verse 2]
I'm a little bit dry
I'm a little bit wet
I'm a little bit concerned with that compost on your breath
I'm a little bit high
I'm a little bit low
I'm all filled with nonsense since you talk so goddamn slow
[Outro]
Everybody look up
Are you in love?
Are you free?
Are you alive?
Are you evil?
Are you all alone?
Are you testing it out?
Are you flying solo?
Aren't you tired?
All alone's the best
All by yourself
You don't even need the rest
Oh, l-l-l-love
But of course you do
Otherwise why the fight?
