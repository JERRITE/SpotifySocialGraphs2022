Seven and Seven Is LyricsWhen I was a boy, I thought that someday I would be a man
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a can
In my lonely room, I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
You can throw me if you wanna 'cause I'm a bone
I go boom bip bip, boom bip bip, yeah

If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes
My father's in the fireplace, my dog lies hypnotized
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day
I go boom bip bip, boom bip bip, yeah
