I Wonâ€™t Look Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
I choose You, no doubt about it
Don't need a minute, my heart is in it, You got it (You got it)
No hesitation, made my decision
I wanna follow You forever, I'm all in

[Chorus]
I won't look back, no
I made my choice and I ain't givin' up, no
I took this road 'cause I believe in love, yeah
I'm fightin' back and I'm on the attack
I made my choice, and I ain't looking back
No no, I ain't lookin' back
No no, I ain't lookin' back
No no no, I ain't lookin' back
I made my choice, and I ain't lookin' back
[Verse 2]
I choose You, yeah I'm not dreamin'
Finally found something to believe in, can you believe it?
No hesitation, made my decision
I'm stickin' with You to the end, I said I'm all in

[Chorus]
I won't look back, no
I made my choice and I ain't givin' up, no (givin' up, no)
I took this road 'cause I believe in love, yeah (believe in love, yeah)
I'm fightin' back and I'm on the attack (oh-ohhh)
I made my choice, and I ain't looking back
No no, I ain't lookin' back
No no, I ain't lookin' back
No no no, I ain't lookin' back
I made my choice, and I ain't lookin'

[Bridge]
Got the whole world at my back tryna tell me "take the broad way"
But I seen first hand, I seen first hand that's the wrong way
Don't wanna die one day and find I threw my life away (woo!)
So hear me say

[Chorus]
I won't look back, no
I made my choice and I ain't coppin' out, no
I'll give 'em heaven, I ain't backin' down, no
I'm fightin' back and I'm on the attack, yeah
I made my choice, and I ain't lookin' back (I ain't lookin' back)
I made my choice and I ain't givin' up, no (givin' up, no)
I took this road 'cause I believe in love (oh yeah)
I'm fightin' back and I'm on the attack (oh-whoa-oh)
I made my choice, and I ain't lookin' back
No no no, I ain't lookin' back
No no no, I ain't lookin' back (oh, oh)
No no no, I ain't lookin' back (no no)
I made my choice, and I ain't lookin' (back)
