Play With Me Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I feel like...
I feel like MJ, I feel like Michael Jackson reincarnated right now in this bitch, man
Love me like I'm dead

[Chorus]
Why would you play with me?
Why would you lay with me? (Why?)
But you ain't stay with me
Not how it 'posed to be (Why?)
My heart is broken, peace
You're such a joke to me
You're such a ho to me (Fuck)
Not how it 'posed to be
Why would you play with me? (Why?)
Why would you lay with me?
But you ain't stay with me
Not how it 'posed to be
My heart is broken, peace (Broke)
You're such a joke to me
You're such a ho to me (Ho)
Not how it 'posed to be
[Verse]
Not how it 'posed to went, think about the time we spent
You're such a selfish bitch (Bitch), I swear I hate that shit
You make me hate living and I can't take this shit
I gotta face this shit, you want a break from me (Fuck)
Uh, if the love was real (Mm), how could it fade away? (How?)
I gave you my heart, it's all that you did to me (You did to me)
I thought you was real, the whole time you envy me (You envy me)
I gave you my heart, my soul (Uh)
I'm talkin' 'bout literally (Literally)
Was thinkin' 'bout trip, uh, flyin' to Italy (To Italy)
Yo' ass run game, you was two steps ahead of me (Ahead of me)
Uh, come hop in my coupe, a stolo and it got leather seats (Leather seats)
I'm in the city for real, it ain't that hard to get up with me

[Chorus]
Why would you play with me? (Why?)
Why would you lay with me?
But you ain't stay with me (Fuck)
Not how it 'posed to be
My heart is broken, peace (Broke)
You're such a joke to me
You're such a ho to me (Ho)
Not how it 'posed to be
Why would you play with me? (Why?)
Why would you lay with me?
But you ain't stay with me (Bitch)
Not how it 'posed to be
My heart is broken, peace (Broke)
You're such a joke to me
You're such a ho to me (Ho)
Not how it 'posed to be

Why won't you lay with me? Why do you play for keeps?
You took my heart from me and you ran far from me
Now your ass, R.I.P, I made you rest in peace
Went on a killing spree, shoulda never played with me

[Outro]
Why would you lay with me?
Why would you play with me?
But you ain't stay with me
Now how it 'posed to be
You're such a joke to me, haha
You're such a ho to me
Now how it 'posed to be11Embed
