Stick Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
If my memory serves me right
I would tuck you in almost every night
Saying, "Sweet dreams" and "Good night"
Right before I turned off all the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
But sweet dreams can turn into nightmares
When our heroes are no longer out there

[Chorus]
I'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you
One day will be tears in your eyes
I'm sorry to give you these memories
'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry
But I'ma stick around
I promise you that I will stick around
For now
[Verse 2]
Let these memories serve you right
When I'm no longer right by your side
Hope you, by then learned to fly
And take with you the good things in life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let your big dreams turn into nightmares
When our heroes are no longer out there

[Chorus]
I'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you
One day will be tears in your eyes
I'm sorry to give you these memories
'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry
But I'ma stick around
I promise you that I will stick around
For now

[Bridge]
And right now
My light is shining, though one day that too will go out
But for now
I'm gonna stick around

[Chorus]
I'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you
One day will be tears in your eyes
I'm sorry to give you these memories
'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry
But I'ma stick around
I promise you that I will stick around
For now
For nowYou might also like14Embed
