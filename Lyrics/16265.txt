So I Can Love You Lyrics[Intro]
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Come on back (Come on back)
I'm not ready to let you go
Come on back (Come on back, baby)
I'm not ready to let you go
No (No, no, no)
I will tell you when I'm ready
(Tell you when I'm ready)
Got to, got to let you know
(I got to let you know)
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't walk away from me, baby
(Like that)
'Cause she came into the room
(Don't turn your back)
'Cause you're gonna tell her today
And I mean what I say
(And tell her right away)

[Chorus]
And I say stay right here, baby
I just can't let you go
Stay right here, baby
So I can love you
Love you, love you, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't walk away from me, baby
(Like that)
'Cause she came into the room
(Don't turn your back)
'Cause you're gonna tell her today
And I mean what I say
(And tell her right away)

[Chorus]
And I say stay right here, baby
So I can love you
Love you, love you, boy
