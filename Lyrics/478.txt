Superstarr Lyrics[Intro: Haile Supreme]
One take killa
(Statik Selektah)

[Hook: Haile Supreme]
So, I heard you want to be a superstar
Do you know what you’re in it for
She said the wrong side
For the right reasons

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
It’s way different when your idols in front of your eyelids
Your top three favorite rhymers be in my bottom five list
I will show no guidance biting on that psilocybine
Money never sleeps, so I sowed open my eyelids
You pussy in real life, heartless without the mic here
I speak truth and shoot, shoot, shoot in case you right there
I’m more Iron Michael, ironic 'cause I’m the one they biting
Statik, they want static, but I won’t drag my feet when I write this
Cocaina up sinuses, got this game to a science
Einsteinin’, if I’m lyin' I’m fryin'; Strike me, lightning!
Stroke of genius when I’m writing, smoke a pea if someone fightin'
And yo nobody do. Somebody hit yo’ lightswitch
Dim yo’ lights, shit. The night is young
And I think I need to check some ID's
You ever, ever eat a woman till you catch the itis?
You ever prayed so hard the devil started crying? (The devil started crying)
[Hook: Haile Supreme]
So, I heard you want to be a superstar
Do you know what you’re in it for
She said the wrong side
For the right reasons

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Hello and welcome to the game welcome to the fame
Where everybody know your name and they see everything
They watchin' everything you say and everywhere you go
Because they follow you and everybody that you know
They showin' you a lot of love but that ain’t how they feel
They tried to figure out the flossers who been for the kill
I keep it trill and tell the truth 'cause they gon' lie to ya
They aimin' arrows at your hearts and let them fly through ya
It be the main ones smiling at your grill
Them the same one hopin' that you dyin', that’s for real
They lift you up to sit back and watch the downfall
Them the motherfuckers you need to keep from round ya'll
I call it like I see it even if I don’t like the view
'Cause I can’t be caught fuckin' around with the likes of you
Make me wanna fight with you 'cause hating’s what you like to do
But that’s ok 'cause we gon' make it, bitch, in spite of you

[Hook: Haile Supreme]
So, I heard you want to be a superstar
Do you know what you’re in it for
She said the wrong side

Fly!
Nothing feels better than getting bands like a wedding ring
Veterinarian to some bitches but I'm a veteran
All that I said to men, bring down to from pebbles to sediments
Get a house settle in, getting money like it's a settlement
If I'm a superstar I hope your my biggest fan
Give a fuck bout your old dude and if this get him mad
I ain't with the back and forth and going for tick for tat
I'm six foot two it's getting tiring being the bigger man
Plus I'm hoping I stay sane with this new found fame
I can hear them talking shit and saying you done changed
Always switch it up and everything ya'll do the same
Gone go to cuba smoke a cabin wear a cuban link
You can make one mistake with the shit you say
Shit is cray yesterday NJA nigga spray
The whole lay hit my unc with a ricochet
He okay, had to pray god don't take him way

[Hook: Haile Supreme]
So, I heard you want to be a superstar
Do you know what you’re in it for
She said the wrong side
