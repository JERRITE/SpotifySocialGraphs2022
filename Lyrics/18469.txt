TranslationsEspa√±olGo On Then, Love Lyrics[Intro]
On the floor in your room
You and I in the afternoon
Starry eyes, losing all our cool
And our minds
On the floor in your room

[Verse 1]
You were in that curved pose, eyes closed
Laughing in slow motion
Cloudy smoke ring, day dream
All the windows open
It's a sweet high, red wine
And nothing left unspoken
When you whispered I heard you say
[Chorus]
Go on then, love
And show me your heart
'Cause you are enough as you are and I'm awestruck
So go on then, love
Go on then, love

[Drop]
Go on then, love

[Bridge]
On the floor, in your room
So alive in that new perfume
I don't mind getting lost in you
And your eyes, on the floor in your room

[Verse 2]
You were in my old Cure T-Shirt
Singin' to a love song
Moving slowly towards me, dancin' with the lights on
With a sweet high, red wine
We drank til' it was all gone
When you whispered I heard you say

[Chorus]
Go on then, love
And show me your heart
'Cause you are enough as you are and I'm awestruck
So go on then, love
Go on then, love

(on then love, on then love, on then love,)
(on then love, on then love, on then love,)
Go on then, love
(on then love, on then love, on then love,)
(on then love, on then love, on then love,)
Go on then, love

[Drop]
Go on then, love
Go on then, love
And show me your heart
'Cause you are enough as you are and I'm awestruck
So go on then, love
Go on then, love1Embed
