Memory Lyrics[Verse 1: Elaine Paige]
Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

[Verse 2: Elaine Paige]
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
[Bridge 1: Elaine Paige]
Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters
And soon
It will be morning

[Verse 3: Elaine Paige]
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

[Bridge 2: Elaine Paige]
Burnt-out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

[Optional Verse]
Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower, as the day is breaking
The memory is fading

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun2Embed
