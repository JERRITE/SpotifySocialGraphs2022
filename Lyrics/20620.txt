Love Me Badder Lyrics[Verse 1]
My pillow smells like your cologne
I just can't wait 'til you get home (ra-ah)
You gangsta ways turn me on (gangsta)
You touch me right and you love me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me (give it to me)
Show it to me, show it to me (show it to me)
Come up on me, come up on me
Oh baby
[Chorus]
Say no one (ay)
No one loves me badder
Than you, I say I say I say
No one (oh)
No one loves me badder
Than you, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody love, nobody body love me
Nobody love, nobody body love me
Nobody love, nobody body love me
Badder than you, no

If loving you was a crime (yeah)
I swear that I wouldn't mind to do the time (woo)
You stole my heart boy, you robbed me blind (oh)
You so criminal, we so criminal

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me (give it to me)
Show it to me, show it to me (show it to me)
