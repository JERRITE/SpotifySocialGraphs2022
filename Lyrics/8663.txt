Always on my mind - re-recorded version LyricsAlways On My Mind

Maybe I didn't love you quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't hold you quite as often as I could have
Litte things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely nights
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mindYou might also likeEmbed
