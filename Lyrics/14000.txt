Cavorting Lyrics[Chorus 1: Liam Fray]
Your club is full of overrated
Dehydrated, goggled eyed girls
And they're trying to stare at me
But their eyes are rattling and they're struggling to see

[Verse 1]
And she can't stand still
'Cause the sixteen pills
That she's taken in the minibus
Her conscience followed her into the night
Gave her mum a fright
I said, "Well, fuck, that it is her own fault for ever letting her out of your sight"
[Chorus 2]
And now you're too tired to eat
And you're too hungry to sleep
You're hooligans on E
And we're too tired to bother with any of you

[Verse 2]
Cavorting and snorting
Your way through the band
Get your hand off me trouser leg
I'm turning up tonight but only to knock you down a peg

[Chorus 2]
And now you're too tired to eat
And you're too hungry to sleep
You're hooligans on E
And we're too tired to bother with any of you

[Chorus 1: Liam Fray]
Your club is full of overrated
Dehydrated, goggled eyed girls
And they're trying to stare at me
But their eyes are rattling and they're struggling to see

[Chorus 2]
And now you're too tired to eat
And you're too hungry to sleep
We're gentlemen, aren't we?
And we're too articulate to bother with any of youYou might also likeEmbed
