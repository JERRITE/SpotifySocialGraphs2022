We’re Just Making It Worse Lyrics[Cameron Avery]

And I don’t wanna believe it
So don’t, don’t let me see it
When you’re with him
And I won’t bring her
Let’s not make it worse
Let’s give ourselves some time…

[Alexandra Savior]
…To start again…
And I don’t know what your papa taught you
But, honey, don’t, don’t you be cruel
Don’t let me see you with her
And I won’t bring him
Don’t make this a thing
Let’s give ourselves some time…

[Cameron Avery]
…To start again…

Our mistakes and choices we make
Or chances we take
Without thinking it through

[Alexandra Savior]
It wasn’t me, neither you
No, this ain’t a thing
I’m just tryin’ to begin, again

[Cameron Avery]
But don’t come here with him

[Alexandra Savior]
And I could have played it better
I kind of wish that I never met her
You might also like[Cameron Avery]
But don’t hold hands with him

[Alexandra Savior]
And you don’t with…

[Cameron Avery, Alexandra Savior]
…her, let’s not make it worse
Let’s give ourselves some time
To start again…

[Cameron Avery]
And I know that it’s only dancing
But don’t let me see you romancing
‘Cause I’m only human
I can’t play it cool when

[Cameron Avery, Alexandra Savior]
I know there’s something still there
I know you still care

[Alexandra Savior]
I know she can’t hold you like I can

[Cameron Avery]
Honey, I’m your man, you know that I am
[Cameron Avery, Alexandra Savior]
You just gotta take me back for good
If only you would

[Alexandra Savior]
But I’m here with him

[Cameron Avery]
And I am with her
[Cameron Avery, Alexandra Savior]
We’re just making it worse
We’re just making it worse
We’re just making it worse2Embed
