Donâ€™t Know How To Say Goodbye Lyrics[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
I'm so in love with you I just don't know what I should do
I'll do nothin' 'n' I'll just dream
I never seem to get it right, it seems that I
I don't know how to say goodbye
And if I did I'd surely cry, a lie
If it's a choice between you and me I'd go for I
And here's why I never really thought you liked me, anyway

[Verse 1]
You're playing games with me
It isn't hard for them to see
Tell me that you're just a cheat
But I don't care I play for keeps tonight
[Refrain]
I don't know how to say goodbye
And if I did I'd surely cry, a lie
If it's a choice between you and me I'd go for I
And here's why I never really thought you liked me anyway

[Chorus]
I'm so in love with you I just don't know what I should do
I'll do nothin' 'n' I'll just dream
I never seem to get it right, it seems that I
I don't know how to say goodbye
And if I did I'd surely cry, a lie
If it's a choice between you and me I'd go for I
And here's why I never really thought you liked me, anywayYou might also likeEmbed
