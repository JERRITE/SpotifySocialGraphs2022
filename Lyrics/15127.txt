Sell Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bloodshot eyes, ruby red with lies
Sells herself for the fix at night
Na na na mm yeah
Na na na mm yeah aw yeah
Find her late at night on the corner
Pulls up her dress and says, "hey you wanna?"
Na na na mm yeah
Na na na mm yeah aw yeah
She injects, eyes roll back, tear to her chest, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Sell yourself
Get some help
Got so high, no
Touch the sky
[Verse 2]
She said, "honey I need some more money
Daddy please I'll make you feel sunny"
Na na mm yeah
Na na na mm yeah aw yeah
He smacked her ass and said, "get some class"
Put some smack in the crack of her ass
[Chorus]
Sell yourself
Get some help
Got so high, no
Touch the sky
[Bridge]
I know it hurts
She sits on top of Earth, yeah
She needs help
She cries all by herself
[Instrumental]
Have you ever looked in pained eyes?
It hurts you in a special place inside, oh no
She does it every single night
Come and help her sleep tonight
[Chorus]
Sell yourself
Get some help
Got so high, no
Touch the skyYou might also likeEmbed
