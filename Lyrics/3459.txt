Little After Sunset Lyrics[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy]
This how music make you feel
This how music make you feel
This how music make you feel

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
I woke up and opened that door
I feel like forever, a cause
We broke up and broke up some more
We back with each other for sure
I thought it was love but it's woe
I'm hoping I'm hoping you call me back
I play with emotions, we both attack
I got a new lady, who told you that?
[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I said you my baby, I owe you that
I hung up, she cursing, I'm calling back
I said I don't need you, I'm running back to you
We both indecisive, I like it, I keep you, I don't wanna cheat you
I hate how I treat you
I know that I need you, I need you back
I'm telling you my secrets, I'm done with that
You know that I'm peaceful, I'm coming back
I'm sorry I'm tripping just call me back (Hello?)
I broke her heart for the hundredth time

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
I thought it was love but it's woe?
I'm hoping I'm hoping you call me back
I play with emotions, we both attack
I got a new lady, who told you that?
I thought it was love but it's woe?
I'm hoping I'm hoping you call me back
I play with emotions, we both attack
I'm sorry I'm tripping just call me back

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
I woke up and opened that door
Feels like forever, a cause
Broke up, we broke up some more
We back with each other for sure
I woke up and opened that door
Feels like forever, a cause
Broke up, we broke up some more
We back with each other for sure

Feels like forever I know
Why can't I leave you alone?
Thought it was love but it was woes
Stepped on my heart and it broke
Who told you where I was and where I've been at?
All she worried bout is who I saw and where I rent at
Put it in some reds
But she loves me for me though right?
I'm getting chips, I'm getting used to the frito life
I got a fetish for really anything independent shorties, dependent born
Finish touring
Coming back home to you to finish scoring
Don't you leave me when you need me, like this
We gotta be something just for me to write this

[Bridge: pineappleCITI]
Don't you worry bout these hoes, baby you already know
Yeah you live in my heart, this is more than just a ball yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy]
I play with emotions, we both attack
I got a new lady, who told you that?
I thought it was love but it's woe
I'm hoping I'm hoping you call me back
I play with emotions, we both attack
I'm sorry I'm tripping just call me back
[Post-Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy, pineappleCITI]
I woke up and opened that door
Why can't I leave you alone?
Feels like forever, a cause
Broke up, we broke up some more
Stepped on my heart and it broke
We back with each other for sure
I woke up and opened that door
Why can't I leave you alone?
Feels like forever, a cause
Broke up, we broke up some more
Stepped on my heart and it broke
We back with each other for sure1Embed
