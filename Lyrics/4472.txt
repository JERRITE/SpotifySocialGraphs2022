Efflictim Lyrics[Verse 1]
How would you feel if you heard the news
That I was dead?
What would you do if you found out from your friends
That I was dead?
Would you cycle through your mind
Think of all the things you should've said
Or coulda did differently
If I was dead?

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna say
Life is too short
Though I make mistakes, baby
I'm tryna make it right
All I'm tryna say is
Life is too short
All we've got is love, baby
And the time to make it right
[Interlude]
If I'm alive that is
If I'm alive that is
Do you think of me at all?
Would you think of me at all?

[Verse 2]
Who would you talk to?
Who would be your friend if I was dead?
Who would you run to?
Who would kiss your face if I was dead?
Would you cycle through your mind
Think of all the things, the good and bad
Seeing things differently
If I was dead?

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna say
Life is too short
Though I make mistakes, baby
I'm trying make things right
All I'm tryna say
Life is too short
All we've got is love, baby
And the time to make it right
You might also like[Interlude]
If I'm alive that is
If I'm alive that is
Do you think of me at all?
Would you think of me at all?

[Outro]
