Freak (Joe Stone 2K18 Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me live on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to go with it
And I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause It's all about the dark in me
Mm-hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck brother
That can satisfy me
Just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
[Chorus]
'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can
All through the night till the early morn'
Come on and I will take you
Around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can
Any time of day it's all good for me

'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can
All through the night till the early morn'
Come on and I will take you
Around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can
Any time of day it's all good for me

[Verse 2]
Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up
Now there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do
I'm packing all the flavor you need
I got you sup on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dog in me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I want to freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck brother
That can satisfy me just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause I will be a freak (Yeaah)
Until the day until the dawn (Oh-yeah)
And we can pump, pump
All through the night till the early morn
Come on and I will take you
Around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can pump, pump
Any time of day it's all good for me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

'Cause I will be a freak (Yeaah, oh-yeah)
'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can pump, pump
All through the night till the early morn
Come on and I will take you
Around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can pump, pump
Any time of day it's all good for meEmbed
