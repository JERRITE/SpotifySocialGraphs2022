Blü Moon Lyrics[Intro: Drew Love]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
How you doin'? [We're doin' this right?]? (Yeah, yeah)
Guess you called me on the right night
Let's go

[Verse 1: Drew Love]
If you speakin' honestly (Yeah, yeah)
Let's cut out the modesty
Know what you want from me (Know what you want from me)
I do, I do
Know I've been here before (Know I've been here before)
Ain't gotta pretend no more
Knew what it was whеn you walked through the door, through the door
[Chorus: Drew Love]
Think you callеd me on a blue moon (Blue moon)
Girl like you they don't do no such thing as too soon (Too soon)
I been tryin' not to move the way I used to (Used to)
Something 'bout the way you move, I could get used to (I could get used to)
(And you say you won't) Call me on a blue moon (Blue moon)
Girl like you they don't do no such thing as too soon (Too soon)
I been tryin' not to move the way I used to (Used to)
Something 'bout the way you move, I could get used to (I could get used to this)

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love]
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh

[Verse 2: Drew Love]
Never been the type to get starstruck
Think it's time a nigga called up
Got so much to offer
So I gotta keep it cautious
Ain't gotta say nothin', you know I been around the way
Skip that bullshit, you might as well just tell it to me straight
Girl, you been caught my eye
I'm thinkin' we might tonight (Thinkin' we might tonight)
You might also like[Chorus: Drew Love]
Think you called me on a blue moon (Blue moon)
Girl like you they don't do no such thing as too soon (Too soon)
I been tryin' not to move the way I used to (Used to)
Something 'bout the way you move, I could get used to (I could get used to)
(And you say you won't) Call me on a blue moon (Blue moon)
Girl like you they don't do no such thing as too soon (Too soon)
I been tryin' not to move the way I used to (Used to)
Something 'bout the way you move, I could get used to (I could get used to this)

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love]
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh

[Outro: Drew Love]
Yeah-yeah

You way too sexy to be all by yourself
