I Wish I Was James Bond Lyrics[Intro]
007; Britain's finest secret agent, licensed to kill
Mixing business with girls and thrills

[Verse 1]
I've seen you walk the screen, it's you that I adore
Since I was a boy I've wanted to be like Roger Moore
A girl in every port, and gadgets up my sleeve
The world is not enough for the both of us it seems

[Chorus]
So I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
[Verse 2]
Hello Mr Bond, I've been expecting you
Martini in your hand, and that eyebrow that you move
Don't take this the wrong way, I know it might sound odd
I'm the next double 0, I'm the right man for the job

[Chorus]
So I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away

[Bridge]
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to thrill
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to kill
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to thrill
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to kill
I wanted to be you, I wanted to be you, I wanted to be someone else
I wanted to be you, I wanted to be you, I wanted to be someone else

[Chorus]
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away
