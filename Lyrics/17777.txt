Fizzler x Fumez the Engineer - Plugged In Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Yo yo
Fumez the engineer, Plugged in
Fizz, fly straight shit
You know how it gets
ZEL, this shit crazy
B-dum-boo

[Verse 1]
Who dat? Back up
Can't let a pass like tiki-taka (aye come here)
Real drippy trapper
Slide round there cah I can't take bad up
Never turn my back on them
But them boy there backstabbers
I got tied alone in mashers
DIY so I purchase hammers
No time for the clutch
Fuck that bro do a handle turn
Take that corner, steer it firm
Now im praying to god that the machine works
Like ProdByWalkz new drops I’m reacting first
When I’m itchy, get chingy its whatevеr, and burst
I might Digga this D cah its whatever
Henny on hеnny
Drink that make the pumpum wetter
I tried drill it on shh but he a speaker like yo Alexa
Shutdown if I spin this vetra
Boy better know like Skepta
I need more headie, Edna
She gon eat up this D if I let her
I told my lightie no pressure
But my brownie does that better
Drip and drill, Dior with leathers
Up town gotta take my wetter
See them man, these points like Nectar
Opps can't pass I’m an interceptor
Yo bro lets step ack
Cah I wanna wet that wet that
Credit me for the slappings
Corn on deck, send that
So please dont tempt man
But i got baddies that tempt man
Step in town like whos got bars?
Fuck I’m bringing round 10 man
[Bridge]
Yo bro lets step ack
Cah I wanna wet that wet that
Credit me for the slappings
Corn on deck, send that
So please dont tempt man
But i got baddies that tempt man
Step in town like whos got bars?
Fuck I’m bringing round 10 man

[Verse 2]
Numbers in a box, calendar
4/5 of the 9 gang patterned up
Im praying it beats like Madara
On them like got it so bro let it beat like [?]
I got this feeling inside
I looked at lowse like yo are you feeling tonight
I got Arabs, I do buy from
And thats what I’m using to slide
From young man lost it, I got tired of losses
If my belly is Nottingham
I gotta grip on my rocket
I do music, I should just stop it
But them man there won’t drop it
And she said yeah she’ll lock it
In return man take her shopping
Bill up a runts cooks
Gelato I wanna smoke on suttin
And man didn't come her for nuttin
Pass me the flame lets smoke on suttin
Slide I know they’re cutting
Cah I got mind and match got suttin
VB with a loaded suttin
I want him to come but he’s loading suttin
I’m fly straight, whats next?
I link Goddy they think I’m Pecks
A close one done me dirty
Now I gotta check mates like Chess
Hear man on a beat its ments
Only rap if you’re bringing the check
We’re lit so see when I step
I told her to buss it like it's SD’s neck
