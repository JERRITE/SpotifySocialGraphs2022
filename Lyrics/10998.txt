Hanging on Too Long Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was just my mistake, thinking you cared
It was just my mistake, thinking you'd be there
That you'd be by my side
And that you wouldn't lie
My mistake

[Verse 2]
It was just my false hope, thinking we'd last, yeah
It was just my false hope, forgot all your past
All those girls you denied
Smashed up hearts hung out to dry
[Chorus]
I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
But I need to move on
Hanging on too long

[Verse 3]
I was a fool for you, right from the start, yeah
I was a fool for you, hoping for a spark
For some kind of sign
That you would be mine

[Chorus]
I know it's wrong, I do, hanging on too long, ooh
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long

[Bridge]
My heart was clutching to what felt right
My head was hoping it could put up a fight

[Chorus]
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I need to move on
I'm hanging on too long
You might also like[Outro]
I know it's wrong, hanging on too long
And I know it's wrong, hanging on too longEmbed
