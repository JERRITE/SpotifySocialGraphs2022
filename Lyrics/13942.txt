Dickâ€™ead Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hate you, I want you
There's something that you do
I've made up my mind now
And I want you to know
You please me, you tease me
You make it look easy
I've made up my mind
I think I want you to know

[Chorus]
Oh, won't these feelings go away
They keep me up when I'm tired of thinking 'bout you, darling
I've been awake for thirteen days
Won't you please just leave me, to go to sleep
And I will go to sleep
[Verse 2]
Well I like how you're coping
By drinking and smoking
The way I feel now ain't how I once felt before

You please me, you tease me
You make it look easy
I've made up my mind
I think I want you to know

[Chorus]
Oh, won't these feelings go away
They keep me up when I'm tired of thinking 'bout you, Darling
I've been awake for thirteen days
Won't you please just leave me, to go to sleep
And I will go to sleep

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Oh ,won't these feelings go away
I've been awake for thirteen days
Oh, won't these feelings go away
They keep me up when I'm tired of thinking 'bout you, dick'eadYou might also likeEmbed
