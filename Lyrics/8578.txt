Love of My Life (Live at Rock in Rio Festival) Lyrics[Crowd]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me
[Crowd]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Freddie Mercury]
Obrigado

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you
(I still love you, ooh)

[Freddie Mercury]
Ooh, I still love you

[Crowd]
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!

[Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Oh, hurry back, hurry back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
You might also like[Crowd]

Love of my life

[Crowd & Freddie Mercury]

[Freddie Mercury]
