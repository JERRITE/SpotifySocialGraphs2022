You look so sweet and fly
Ah, thank you baby (Ah)
Look so s— (Ah, yeah)
Like to (Ah, yeah)
Look so s— (Ah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
All my life I wanted money, fame
A bad bitch and a [?] and everything else that I could obtain
So I pay to fix the roof over my mother
Had to pay to feed the fam in the gettho who shared that common pain
The common [?] of empty pockets like it's [?] season
Nigg*s thought [?] or selling or [?] fam even
And when they ask me to explain and give a firm reason
I look 'em in the eye and say "Poverty was the damn reason"
It was either death, a prison or start rapping like Wayne
Like John and Charlie, man I really wanted that money train
"Enjoy the pain and speak your brain" was what my homies said
I paid my own lane and now they yelling "Oh that boy insane"
[Chorus]
Yeah I make it look so easy
But I just put it in to put my city on like Jeezy
Am I here doing work when my homeboy [?]
And we gon' make a million next year
I promise you should believe me

I mean I know I make it look so simple
But I been working hard so I could buy this [?] like Pitbull
And we are not the same boy, I do this for my people
I mean we all human is this world
And yo, we could never be equal

[Hook]
I know it seems too hard
But I'll make it through it all
Yeah, I would take that fall
So you don't have to (work)

Yeah, long as I live baby (You don't have to work)
Uh, long as I breathe shorty (You don't have to work)
Yeah, go tell the people I love that they gon' never have to (work)

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I wondered what mom was crying about
And I had to figure out how to hustle and make my daddy proud
And make the right amount to pay the bills and take my shorty out
And [?] was on my albums like "Man, are we ever cashing out?"
Yeah nigg*, it's that season
And everything that happen is for a God damn reason
Call the police that I ain't trying to go to prison
But rather lock me up with [?[ just committed treason
You might also like[Chorus]
I know I made it look so easy
But I just put it in to put my city on like Jeezy
I had a conversation with my homeboy [?]
I told him "I'ma be a billionaire"
[?] trust her you would believe me

I mean I know I make it look so simple
But I just put the work in every day, it's like I reach for
A different kind of artist, man I [?] different [?]
I know we all human in this world and yo
We could never be equal

[Hook]
I know it seems so hard
But I'll make it thruugh it all
Yeah, I would take that fall
So you don't have to (work)

Yeah, long as I live baby (You don't have to work)
Uh, and when I die shorty (You don't have to work)
Nah, go tell the people I love that they don't ever have to (Work)

[Outro]
Yeah, uh, uh (Work)
You don't have to work (Work)Embed
