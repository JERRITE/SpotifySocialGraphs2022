5 Rebbeccas Lyrics[Verse 1: Kyle Falconer]
I love the dress sense and the colour of your hair
The way you say that people who are working
They are aiming to be posh my dear
People flocked around you by the smokies in our school
Teachers they contained in all their anger as you regularly broken the rules
And everyone done the pill but solvent abuse it can kill
The first taste of heaven there was splattered on the screen Floating with the schemers
And the part-time Halloweeners and the Lochee team
And everyone done the pill
But solvent abuse (can kill)
[Chrous: Kyle Falconer]
Five Rebbecca's all of them close to me
One of them's a cook, one  of them does history
One of them's my niece and one lives close
The one I love the most has turned into a junkie

[Verse 2: Kyle Falconer]
So under-satisfied with minors at your age
Aand something so deceiving
When you find you're self-conceiving on a holy day
So unachievable with minors at your height
And something so deceiving
When you find yourself conceiving on a Sunday night
And everyone done the pill
But solvent abuse (can kill)

[Chrous: Kyle Falconer]
Five Rebecca's all of them close to me
One of them's a cook, one  of them does history
One of them's my niece and one lives close
The one I love the most has turned into a junkie

[Verse 3: Kyle Falconer]
Poor Miss Rebbecca, you'll be missed my girl
If it wasn't for the treasure you'd be rich my girl
Saved you from the terror and your so-called friends
Took a back seater but they kicked it in the end though
Your sitting really cosy in your humble black cave
Doesn't seem likely for a girl your age
Us cupid little kids can never look back
When one of us is lying in a big brown bag

Oh-h, oh-h

[Chrous: Kyle Falconer]
Five Rebbecca's all of them close to me (five)
One of them's a cook, one  of them does history
One of them's my niece and one lives close
Five Rebbecca's all of them close to me (five)
One of them's a cook, one  of them does history
One of them's my niece and one lives close
The one I love the most has turned into a junkie

[Outro: Kyle Falconer]
I love the dress sense and the colour of your hair
The way you say that people who are working
I can tell you: that's a touch, my dearEmbed
