White Line Fever Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I breathe my disease, brings me to my knees
All you need is a taste, it'll set you free
Your infection's my discretion, honey, one and the same
Counting second till I'm medicated, fucked in the brain

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want this, baby
I just need it to carry on

[Chorus]
I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in, yeah yeah
[Post-Chorus]
I sold my soul

[Verse 2]
Licking every drop of poison off a pocket of keys
While some daddy's little angel's getting dirt on her knees
When the sun comes down the filth runs free
You'll never find a finer specimen of filth than me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want this
I just need this to carry on

[Chorus]
I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Some have said that I'm the devil and it's just as well
'Cause I've been through and burned down and rebuilt hell
With my heart in a vice and a knife in my back
I've got a noose for the world, that I'm painting black

[Chorus]
I got the white line fever and an appetite for sin
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in
I sold my soul so long ago, a bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole headed for hell, then, baby, count me in
