Wall of Glass Lyrics[Verse 1]
You would keep the secrets in ya'
You be keeping paraphernalia, oh
I think you know
Anyone can walk up to ya'
Anyone can see right through your eyes
All night

[Chorus]
And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
[Verse 2]
You believe in fascinations
And designer vaccinations, love
You get along
You were sold a one direction
I believe the resurrection's on
And you were wrong

[Chorus]
And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
And I don't mean to be unkind
But I see what's in your mind
And the stone you throw
Will turn back in its path
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
Wall of glass
Wall of glass
One day you'll shatter like a wall of glassYou might also like15Embed
