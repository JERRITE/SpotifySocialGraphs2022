Learning How to Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say
They say that trust it takes time
That it's a mountain to climb
I think that I am the reason why

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for
Things to change in my heart again
I've been changing
While waiting I'll keep taking steps for you
I've been changing
But I'm still learning how to love
[Verse 2]
Take me
I feared that love wouldn't take me
I feared that grace was a maybe
I feared the cost of my broken words
Trust me
You took my hand and said, "trust me"
You took my heart and said, "Love me
With who you are, not with who you were"

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for
Things to change in my heart again
I've been changing
While waiting I'll keep taking steps for you
I've been changing
But I'm still learning how to love
I'm still learning how to love

[Bridge]
Oh, these storms I know
These battles of the soul
The scars, they start to show
While learning how to love

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for
Things to change in my heart
I've been changing
While waiting I'll keep taking steps for you
I've been changing
But I'm still learning how to love
I'm still learning how to love
I'm still learning how to loveYou might also likeEmbed
