Emergency Contact Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no greater vengeance
Than learning to enjoy again
Hope you get the message
Nobody's shatter-resistant (Shit)

[Verse 2]
Therapy is tiring
But so is hiding how you feel
You can bring the villainy
And I can bring the sex appeal
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me something
Or let me out, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of

[Chorus]
Things that I want, this happily-ever-after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my еmergency contact

[Verse 3]
Balanced on a razor bladе
Lick you like a battery
Your speakers can't handle the bass
But you look good under the LEDs

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me something
Or let me out, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of

[Chorus]
Things that I want, this happily-ever-after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my emergency contact
You might also like[Bridge]
You're my angel
You're a fucking angel
You're my angel
All mine
Mine
Mine, mine
Mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me something
Oh, my God, I'm starving
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of

[Chorus]
Things that I want, this happily-ever-after
You choke on your words, but you swallow them faster
I sleep on the couch while you're passed out in the back
Just want you to be my emergency contactEmbed
