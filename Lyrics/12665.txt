Blood Infections Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna try
I wanna live all night
And burn out bright
I want you to know
What I can't show the outside
It's why I hide
But your friends say I'm no good for you
What do they know?
Please don't listen to a goddamn thing they say
[Chorus]
Tonight's our night
Just don't hurt me, don't hurt me
I'll give you my heart
Tonight's our night
Just don't hate me, don't hate me
For taking your light

[Verse 2]
I need a love
I want enough to keep my thirst satisfied
I wanna take your hand
Make you understand my side
Our kind
But I know it’s hard for you to let go of the world that you knew
Please just close your eyes
We’re better off this way

[Chorus]
Tonight's our night
So don't hate me, trust in me
I'll show you my world
Tonight's our night
So don't hurt me, don't hurt me
I'm so scared of what's to come

In the dark, in the dark, no one hides but me
In the dark, in the dark, no one hides but me
In the dark, in the dark, no one hides but me
In the dark, in the dark, no one gets away
In the dark, in the dark, no one gets away
In the dark, in the dark, no one gets away
In the dark, in the dark, no one gets away
We own the night

[Chorus]
Every night's our night
So stay with me, be with me
'Til the end of this world
Every night's our night
So stay with me, be with me
Until the end of this world

[Outro]
We own the night
We own the night
We own the night
We own the night6Embed
