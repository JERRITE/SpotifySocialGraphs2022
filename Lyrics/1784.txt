Night Terrific! Lyrics[Intro]
If you need to come by
[?]
I can never lose my [?]
Feel a way when you look in my eyes

[Hook]
Game as she walk my way
Alright, okay
Even if I walk away
Loving don't fade
[Verse 1: Yaqob & ODIE]
Like who knows
When the time right
Put a move on
In the limelight
Get your groove on (groove on)
Got my buzz right
All moon long
But I'm uptight cause
Game as she walk my way
It's the move home
Even if I walk away
What I lose huh?
Need a little company
All night, for me

[Verse 2 x3]
What do you know
We're all alone, oh my
And I gotta say
I feel your soul, no lie
Cause even if I'm falling asleep
Your love is awake
You know my mind
Even if we weren't meant to be
I still gotta say
What it feels likeYou might also like1Embed
