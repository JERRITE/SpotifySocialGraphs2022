The Riverboat Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see double up ahead
Where the riverboat
Swayed beneath the sun
Is where the river runs red
Like a king who stalks
The wings and shoots a dove
And frees an eagle instead

[Pre-Chorus]
It's more or less the same
As the things that you said
[Verse 2]
I see trouble up the road
Like the things you found
In love are by the way
And like to cheat on your soul
Like the best and worst
Of thoughts that lose control
Before you lie on your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
It's more or less the same
As the things that you said

[Chorus]
And anyway for all the things you know
Tell me why does the river not flow
Anyway for all the things you said
Tell me why does the river run red

And anyway for all the things you've seen
Tell me when will the river run green
And anyway for all the things you know
Tell me why does the river not flow

[Verse 3]
It's more or less the things
You fail to say in your way that's your trouble
Like a king who stalks the wings
And shoots the moon and the stars
And his double
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It’s more or less the same as the things that you said

[Chorus]
Anyway for all the things you know
Tell me why does the river not flow
Anyway for all the things you said
Tell me why does the river run red

Anyway for all the things you've seen
Tell me when will the river run green
And anyway for all the things you know
Tell me why does the river not flow

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I see double up ahead
Where the riverboat swayed beneath the sun
Is where the river runs red
I see double, that's my troubleEmbed
