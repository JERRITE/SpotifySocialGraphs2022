TranslationsEnglishWalkin (Key Glock Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah, ah, ah (Ah, yeah)

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Clear a path as I keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Walkin' with my back against the sun
I been runnin' all my life, that's way before my life begun
Since my birth and seconds on Earth, I been the first one to confront
All of these cycles that get recycled, makin' it stifle while I stunt
Roll me a blunt so I forget it
But it make the details look so vivid (So vivid)
Went through a lot of shit in the last year (Uh-huh)
Then I said, "Fuck it, I'ma handle my business" (Yeah, yeah)
I pay 180 to talk to one lady
She been regulatin' on how I feel (Feel)
Describe it as raw and real (Real)
I'm dealin' with all the ills
I'm tearin' up like I'm on Dr. Phil (Cry)
Ain't no use, you gotta walk (Walk)
Ain't no use, you gotta walk (Walk)
Who the fuck said, "Stop the track," bruh? Let a real nigga talk (Yeah)
I walk from the bitches, I walk from the friendship
I walk from some digits, 'cause lately, my nigga, I'm feelin' indifferent (Uh)
I wish all the best, and believe that, I meant it (Huh?)

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten

It's a whole lotta money in this cold world
Young nigga, go and make you some, uh
It's a whole lotta money in this cold world
Young nigga had to take me some (Yeah)
Fucked around, turned to a boss, uh
Momma gave birth to a boss (Boss, yeah)

Well, fuck nigga, I ran (Yeah, yeah), ran up the bands
My money was locked in the can (The can)
I had to do what I can, a man told me

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]

So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
