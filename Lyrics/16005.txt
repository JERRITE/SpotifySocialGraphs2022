Toucha, Toucha, Toucha, Touch Me Lyrics[JANET]
I was feeling done in
Couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before
I felt there's no use getting
Into heavy petting
It only leads to trouble and seat wetting

Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more
[MAGENTA & COLUMBIA]
More! More! More!

[JANET]
I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
I need assistance...


Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty!
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

Then if anything grows (chuckle)
While you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down

[MAGENTA & COLUMBIA]
Down! Down! Down!

[JANET]
And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand
Oh, I need action!
You might also likeTouch-a, touch-a, touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty!
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night! (x2)

[COLUMBIA]
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me!

[MAGENTA]
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me!

[JANET]
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a touch me
I wanna be dirty!
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night!

[ROCKY]
Creature of the night!
