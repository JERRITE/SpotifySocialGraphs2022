Sour Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
She turned away, what was she lookin' at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
She turned away, what was she lookin' at?
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl when she left me

[Chorus]
What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do, I follow?
[Verse 2]
Don't turn away, what are you lookin' at?
He was so happy on the day that he met her
Say, what are you looking at?
I was a superman, but looks are deceiving
The roller-coaster ride's a lonely one
I paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a teenage girl when she met me

[Chorus]
What would you do?
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do, I follow?
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do, I follow?

[Bridge]
The girl got reasons
They all got reasons

[Chorus]
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do, I follow?
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do if I followed you?
What would you do, I follow?

Hey! What are you lookin' at?
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me, the day that she left me
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
The day that she left me, the day that she left me
She was a sour girl the day that she met me
The day that she met me, the day that she met me1Embed
