Can You Keep a Secret? Lyrics[Verse 1]
So much on my brain, don't know if you can take it
Your heart is fragile baby, I don't wanna break it
If you know my sins, will you still trust me?
If I let you in, will you still love me?
Can you keep a secret?

[Verse 2]
I've got skeletons, they're coming out the closet
The hands around my throat don't want me to be honest
If you know my sins, will you still trust me?
If I let you in, will you still love me?
[Chorus]
I, I see monsters in my bed
I, I got screws loose in my head
If I show you inside me, the ghost in my mind
Will you treat them like your friends?
I, I gotta know
Can you keep a secret?

[Verse 3]
Look me in my eyes and see what I've been hiding
Don't act surprised, you know I've always hated lying
Gave your heart and soul to me to take it
You're the one who said, nothing could change it

[Chorus]
I, I see monsters in my bed
I, I got screws loose in my head
If I show you inside me, the ghost in my mind
Will you treat them like your friends?
I, I gotta know
Can you keep a secret?You might also like6Embed
