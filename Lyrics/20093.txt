VOICESINMYHEAD Lyrics[Intro]
Xerogi
You know what I'm sayin', let the world burn, in this bitch
Hey, yah, aye

[Verse 1]
I heard the devil knocking at my front door
What does it want, I think it wants my soul
I Tried to hang myself but the damn noose broke
So I popped me some pills and everything went so slow
Yuh, I don't wanna give my wrist a cut
They gone see the blood, but I don't really give a fuck
Depression eating at my heart until I'm stuck inside the dark
With no one I can trust
I point the gun up to my head and let that muhfucka bust
[Hook]
Voices in my head, someone please make it stop
Voices in my head, someone please make it stop
It will not subside, might just die
Left to rot
Voices in my head, someone please make it stop

[Bridge]
I didn't mean to kill
The voices in my head they forced me to
This is not a song, this is a message
I am warning you
I didn't mean to kill
The voices in my head they forced me to
This is not a song, this is a message
I am warning you!

[Verse 2]
I am not myself, I can't control myself, don't stay
God hates my existence, so it's in vain if I pray
Voices in my head won't go away, I can't escape
These pills won't help, I'm by myself, I guess this is my fate
I am not myself, I can't control myself, don't stay
God hates my existence, so it's in vain if I pray
Voices in my head won't go away, I can't escape
These pills won't help, I'm by myself, I guess this is my fate!
