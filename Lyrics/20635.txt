3 Strikes Lyrics[Intro]
Down for one night, like I got three strikes
Down for one night, like I got three strikes
Down for one night, like I got three strikes
Down for one night, like I got three strikes

[Hook: Chopped Vocals]

-don me, called on me, called on me
-don me (ain't) -don me (yeah) -don me
-don me, called on me, called on me
[Verse 1]
Doing like 95 on the interstate
Looking for a dinner plate
I'm hungry, you called me
To say you got something, and it's all me

[Pre-Hook]
Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?
I need you to free me, it's a prison inside my mind
Break me, taste me
Roll me up like the northern lights
Can you hold me down for one night, like I got three strikes?

-don me (ain't) -don me (yeah) -don me
-don me, called on me, (like I got three strikes) called on me

[Verse 2]
Lit up, burnt out
Closer to God than we've ever been now
Sipping slow, talking loud
Enough soul, we could sell out
