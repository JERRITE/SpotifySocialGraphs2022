Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah now
All mine, mine, mine, mine
Yeah, road too all bright

[Verse 1]
Nothing too much just out of sight
You say you love me
If this is true, the best thing to do
Is to lie down beside me
I said I love you
Now nothing too much just out of sight
Oh, don't you want to be fair?
In the beautiful in the twilight now
Of the half-night, it was all bright
All bright

[Verse 2]
I love you
I said I love you
I thought you knew
The last thing to do was to try to betray me
The new morning light, I'll never forget it
That's just out of sight

Twilight of the half-night
Southwest, I was barely obsessed
Nothing too much all bright

[Verse 3]
All I can remember, the beautiful air
I can't remember, why did you take me there?
Don't you try to betray me, yeah
You don't wanna betray me
I was barely obsessed, the way
I was barely obsessed with the way she undressed

Bright nothing too half-night
Yeah, it was all right, all bright
Now nothing too much just out of sight

[Verse 4]
Now nothing too much just out of sight
In the beautiful air

Oh, don't you wanna be frightened of the half-night
Beautiful air
On the road to the west, oh, I was barely obsessed
By the way she undressed in the moonlight
In the twilight of the half-night
It was alright, all bright

All bright
Well nothing too much
It was alright
Just out of sight

The last thing to do was to try to betray meEmbed
