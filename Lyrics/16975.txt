Ain’t No Woman (Like the One I’ve Got) Lyrics[Intro: The Four Tops]
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
Ain't no woman like the one I've got

[Verse 1: Levi Stubbs]
Every day the sun comes up around her
She can make the birds sing harmony
Every drop of rain is glad it found her
Heaven must have made her just for me
When she smiles, so warm and tender
A sight for sore eyes to see, hoo
[Chorus: The Four Tops, Lawrence Payton, Obie Benson & Duke Fakir]
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
(Oh no, they don't come better)
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
(She don't ask for things, no diamond rings)
Sewed together, like a hand in glove
(Like pages in a letter)
Ain't no woman like the one I love

[Verse 2: Levi Stubbs & The Four Tops]
She can build me up when it's down I'm goin' (I'm goin')
Put a little music in my day
Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin' (It keeps growin')
Bigger every minute that she stays away
I would kiss the ground she walks on
'Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey now, woo-hoo

[Chorus: The Four Tops, Lawrence Payton, Obie Benson & Duke Fakir]
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
(Well, I kiss the ground she walks on)
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
(She's a real good friend right to the end)
Sewed together like a hand in glove
(I'm a lonely man when she's gone)
People, ain't no woman like the one I love
You might also like[Interlude: Levi Stubbs]
Ooh, what a good, good thing I've got
She means, she means a lot

[Chorus: The Four Tops, Lawrence Payton, Obie Benson & Duke Fakir]
Ain't no woman like the I've got
(Oh no, they don't come better)
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
(She don't ask for things, no diamond rings)
Sewed together, like a hand in glove
(Like pages in a letter)
Ain't no woman like the one I love, people

[Outro: The Four Tops & Levi Stubbs]
Ain't no woman like the one I've got
(Well, I kiss the ground she walks on)
To make her happy doesn't take a lot
(And I'm a lonely man when my baby's gone)Embed
