Cool Enough Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got body, God body
Mind, body, can't stop it, ayy
You want it, you got it
Drippin' like water faucet
I'd do anything, bend any way
Bend any how for you
And you screwed me today, threw me away
Now you don't know how to say I
I feel so numb, stuck, feel like a dumb fuck
Demons get buck, buck around me
I got the nunchucks, we fight for duck, duck
You don't want real beef tings with me
[Pre-Chorus]
You switched sides on me (Ooh-ooh)
You, you, you, you
You switched sides on me

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody knows who the fuck you is
Handle biz like it's jizz, wipe it clean
But you think you're cool enough, cool enough
I guess you're just cool enough, cool enough
Nobody crosses me like you did
Can't believe, bend the dick prodigy
Bet you think you're cool enough, cool enough
Wow, guess you're just cool enough, huh?

[Verse 2]
You switch sides like a butterfly
Caterpillar kinda dick but I'm tryna fly
Everybody knows you're wrong when I'm really right
But you love to do me wrong, power trippin', why?
But I really feel like you and I
Could have fixed our things and then could fly
The way you had me fallin' in, evil grin
Fallin' in, sink or swim, wavy (Wavy)

[Pre-Chorus]
You switched sides on me (Ooh-ooh)
You, you, you, you
You switched sides on me
Found out you lied on me
Now it's bye, bye, bye, bye only
My nigga, you switched sides on me
You might also like[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody knows who the fuck you is
Handle biz like it's jizz, wipe it clean
But you think you're cool enough, cool enough
I guess you're just cool enough, cool enough
Nobody crosses me like you did
Can't believe, bend the dick prodigy
Bet you think you're cool enough, cool enough
Wow, guess you're just cool enough, huh? (Cool enough)

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Don't, don't, ooh (Ooh-ooh, ooh)Embed
