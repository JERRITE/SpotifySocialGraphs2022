Sink or Swim Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if the Devil was a lie?
What if God did not exist?
So with all due respect, tell me, what is death
If life is just a bitch?
I see the evil in their eyes
I hear the lies behind their grin
They wander in the dark, they do not have a heart
Don't let them take you in
Brace for impact
[Pre-Chorus]
You will pay the price for betraying me
You will pay the price
You will pay the price for betraying me
You will pay the price

[Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
Man overboard, man overboard

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in ghosts
Conducting from the grave?
We're nothing but pawns, so move to where they want
'Cause life is just a game
I have my hands around your throat
And a smile upon my face
Squeeze until you choke 'cause I will not let go
Until I feel okay
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You will pay the price for betraying me
You will pay the price for betrayâ€”

[Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
Man overboard, man overboard
[Bridge]
I bid farewell to you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve
And after all (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I've forgiven you for things that you have done, yeah
I bid farewell to you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (Deserve, deserve)
And after all (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I forgive you for things that you have done
[Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
Man overboard, man overboard (Man overboard)

[Outro]
Man overboard (Man overboard)
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard (Man overboard)
It's sink or swim, it's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard1Embed
