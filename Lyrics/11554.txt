Kissing Lessons Lyrics[Verse 1]
Rachel was a year older
When I was in the second grade
I thought she might know everything
I took her word like a golden ring
I asked her how to win my man
And she said, "I know just the thing"
Gave me lip gloss and a hair toss
And after school, a lesson in kissing

[Verse 2]
She called me by the name of a crush
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her baby or darling most the time
[Verse 3]
We'd take turns being seduced
Imagining the day it would come into use
Imagining thе day we'd start breaking hearts
And taking namеs

[Bridge]
She wanted a three-story house
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father
Children and their father
Three sons and a beautiful daughter (Oh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Rachel's family moved out of town
I don't remember when we stopped hanging out
But I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet
And wonder if she thinks of me as her first kissYou might also like2Embed
