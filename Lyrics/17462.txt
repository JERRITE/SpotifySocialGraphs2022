New Vibe Who Dis Lyrics[Chorus]
Bye bye, out of my mind
You say hello and I don't reply
Got my own friends
You got yours, you don't know me

Anymore, I'm on the way up
Look at the ground, I won't wait up
Not coming down from this (this, this, this, this)
Got a new vibe, who dis?
Got a new vibe, who dis?

R-I-P -- Didn't meant to get savage
2019, but you know the old adage
"Never judge a person by their worst picture"
Gotta look deeper, gotta find a finsta
Got my own fam, too bad you're not in it
I'm head of the table every night for dinner
You a little salty, better pass the pepper
Go ahead and @ me, but I got the paper

[Chorus]
Bye bye, out of my mind
You say hello and I don't reply
Got my own friends
You got yours, you don't know me

Anymore, I'm on the way up
Look at the ground, I won't wait up
Not coming down from this (this, this, this, this)
Got a new vibe, who dis?

[Post-Chorus]
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new, got a, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a got a got a got a
You might also like[Verse 2]
Got no chill, if you call you go to voicemail
Slide in my DM and I guarantee that you fail
Feelin so high I'm on another level
They say I'm so bad, call me the devil
Just like a vegetable we bout to turn up
Whole crowd bounce and I think I own this club
Sun is coming up but we're on a roll
Do it all again, talk about squad goals

[Chorus]
Bye bye, out of my mind
You say hello and I don't reply
Got my own friends
You got yours, you don't know me

Anymore, I'm on the way up
Look at the ground, I won't wait up
Not coming down from this (this, this, this, this)
Got a new vibe, who dis?

[Post-Chorus]
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new, got a, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a got a got a got a new vibe
Who dis?
Who dis?
Who dis?
Who dis? (A new vibe, who dis?)
Who dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis...

[Chorus]
Bye bye, out of my mind
You say hello and I don't reply
Got my own friends
You got yours, you don't know me

Anymore, I'm on the way up
Look at the ground, I won't wait up
Not coming down from this (this, this, this, this)
Got a new vibe, who dis?

[Post-Chorus]
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new, got a, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a new vibe, got a new vibe (who dis?)
Got a got a got a got a new vibe

Who dis?
Who dis?
Who dis?
Who dis? (A new vibe, who dis?)
Who dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis, dis...Embed
