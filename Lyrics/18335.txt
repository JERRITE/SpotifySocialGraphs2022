The Assignment Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
That's fire

[Verse 1]
I'm big fine, too confident (Yeah)
I don't need your compliment (Uh-uh)
Bad bitch, I'm dominant
Trunk bussin', got diamonds in it (Money)
She talkin', but she ain't tryin' it
He keep calling me crying, bitch (Yuh)
Damn, Tay, you killed this
I understood the assignment (Duh)
[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Rich)
I understood the assignment
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh (Duh)
I understood the assignment (Bitch, I'm done)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I-I understood the assignment (Bitch, we good)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Bitch, I understood the assignment (Duh)

[Verse 2]
All my bitches piped up (Yeah)
Damn, you fine like duh (Okay)
Keep that pussy locked up (Okay)
He a broke boy, he can't touch (Ew)
Damn, you fine like duh, like duh, like duh (Duh), ayy, yuh, yuh (Yuh)
Damn, you fine like duh, like duh, like duh, duh, bitch, you fine
Bitch, you fine, fine (Okay), he wanna be mine, mine (Duh)
I'm a cowgirl (Yee-haw), he gotta be prime time (Money)
She a side ho on the sideline (Mhm, oh, man)
She a sad ho (Oh, man), ain't got no time, time (I don't)
Roâ€” Rollie got me blinged up and I got my team up
Valentino kingdom, damn, Tay, you clean those (Money)
Switch shots like a free throw, jetski's for the weak ho
This ain't for no weak ho (Uh-huh), shoutout to my freak hoes

[Outro]
I did it, It's over
I murked it, it's over
I own that shit
Tay Money season is forever
I told you that shit
You bitches is seasonal
Tay motherfucking Money is forever, ho
These bitches do what I do and that's that
That's facts, we get straight in, we back, back
I got them racks, racks all up in my backpack
I'm with Trinidad and I'm fine, I'm going home, home1Embed
