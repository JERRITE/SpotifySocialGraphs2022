Forever My Father Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't have to be so scared
You don't have to go tonight
I just need to hold on tight
For one hell of a ride

[Verse 2]
And we lost it all just now
To the nights that left you out
So we'll let this go somehow
But you're gonna be proud
(So proud)
[Chorus]
And I just needed you to pick me up
Like you did when we were younger
When the lightning and the thunder
Had me clinging to your heart
For someone
To lift me up
When I'm down, when I'm forgotten
You'll forever be my father
And I'll be saving tears in jars for this one

[Verse 3]
How can I fit all these words
Into such a simple verse
It's the last time that we'll speak
So listen to me please

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
I just needed you to lift me up
(I just needed) To lift me up

[Chorus]
And I just needed you to lift me up
Like you did when we were younger
When the lightning and the thunder
Had me clinging to your heart
For someone
To lift me up
When I'm down, when I'm forgotten
You'll forever be my father
And I'll be saving tears in jars for this one
You might also like[Outro]
Did you know that you're my heart
And it hurts to be apart
And this cut it hurts so deep
So sing me to sleepEmbed
