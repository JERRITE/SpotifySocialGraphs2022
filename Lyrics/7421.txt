Losing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I walked up to you one day
And ripped your heart out?
How would you feel if I said to you
"That's how I feel you're treating me"
"That's how I feel that you're treating me"

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like I'm losing you
Oh how can that be true?
I know you want me too
[Verse 2]
And how would you feel if I walked up to someone else
And ripped their heart out?
How would you feel if I said to you
"That's how I feel"

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like I'm losing you
Oh how can that be true?
I know you want me too

Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh how can that be true?
I know you want me too

[Bridge]
How could you lie to me time and time again?
I'm getting tired of everything you say
But I want you anyway

[Chorus]
Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh how can that be true?
I know you want me too

Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh how can that be true?
I know you want me too
