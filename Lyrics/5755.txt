Girls & Boys Lyrics[Verse 1]
Streets like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the '90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for
[Chorus]
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

[Verse 2]
Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr sch√∂n
But we haven't been introduced

[Chorus]
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Looking for girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh39Embed
