Where Do We Go from Here? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like waking up from a fantasy
And all that's left is you and me
We're invincible in a violet sea
Dare to move, dare to believe

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
How do you fly with no wings?
How do you breathe without dreams?
Where do we go from here?
From here
From here
[Verse 2]
In the changing wind, it echoes deep
Wearing thin the heart beneath
There's no place to call our own
Like a drifting haze, we roam

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
How do you fly with no wings?
How do you breathe without dreams?
Where do we go from here?
From here
From here

[Outro]
From here
