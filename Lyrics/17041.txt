Day 1 â—‘ Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You'll always be my Day 1
Day 0 when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1
Thankful you're my

[Verse 1]
I got lucky finding you
I won big the day that I came across you
'Cause when you're with me, I don't feel blue
Not a day goes by that I would not redo
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants to love (Yeah, that's right)
It's easy when you try hard enough
Yeah, that's right

[Chorus]
You'll always be my Day 1
Day 0 when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1
I'm thankful you're my Day 1

[Verse 2]
When I first met you, it just felt right
It's like I met a copy of myself that night
I don't believe in fate as such
But we were meant to be together, that's my hunch

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants true love
It's out there if you look hard enough
Enough, enough

[Chorus]
You'll always be my Day 1
Day 0 when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1

Hour by hour, minute by minute
I got mad love for you and you know it
I would never leave you on your own
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
You'll always be my Day 1 (Day 1)
Day 0 when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1 (Thankful you're my Day 1)
You'll always be my Day 1
Day 0 when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my Day 1 (Day 1)

[Outro]
Day 1 (Day 1)
Day 1 (Day 1)
Thankful you're my Day 1 (Day 1)
Thankful you're my Day 1 (Day 1)16Embed
