Revelations Lyrics[Intro: Sample]
"People think that I'm lazy
People think that I'm this fool because
I gives a fuck about the government
I didn't graduate from high school
But I learned how it's done
So I'm gonna be number one
Thank you Jesus, for my mama
Thank you bitches, for my money—"

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
I must be outta my mind
Making niggas wake up to open up to the light
Smoking good dank, yeah, nigga this must be life
Oh, we making moves you niggas thought we was fine
Nah, a nigga go hard for my niggas 'till we all confident
Down liquor, fuck, livers all my niggas know
Two blunts, four strains in the middle dough
We getting knowledge from the motherfuckin' reefer smoke
Born to lead a generation through storm
In a time so hard while you niggas go soft
Change your dreams ma nigga, puff your weed ma nigga
Get high, not low
Hustle in the summer 'till the motherfuckin' winter
And my flow go hard like a motherfuckin' missile
You can catch me in the trap, with the hustlers and the killers
Putting on for my city like we entered the Olympics
Repping out for my gang, where we 'bout that love, we don’t bang
‘Less a heathen step out his lane
Then you know them hammers gon' rang, rang
Nah, fuck that nigga, get your brain up
And if you can’t get rhythm, get your paper
And if you can’t get both, nigga, wake up, gold chains
Purp puff, so I'm feeling like a Laker
Demons try to get a nigga but they never shaped us
They see winning our kids so they hate us
But we the realest motherfuckers, no makeup
Psychedelic life bearin' like a creator
Ain’t no debating, who is the greatest
It is up in your heart, nigga, go out create it
Get out the matrix, why you stuck in the dark, nigga?
[Hook: Sample]
"We kick crowns, kings, and Adidas"
"We kick crowns, kings, and Adidas"
"Get high, bitches, get high, niggas"
"We kick crowns, kings, and Adidas"
"This shit is fresh"

[Verse 2: AKTHESAVIOR]
All my life niggas told me that I ain’t shit
Funny how things flip, knowledge of the ancient
Ain’t shit if you ain’t fit
Bought a plane tick' to astral land and my motherfucking brain’s sick
Crane kick to the government, fuck ‘em man
Martial law they don’t care about a brother, man
Expanded brain, broke out the frame
Then I became a light bearer nearer to the sun
I’m staying, fuck you taking ‘bout?
I’m a fucking living god, find a truth deep inside
Mind body and soul float the most high up, I be a ghost
Comatose, Mary Jane we elope in the mists of the smoke
Elevate your mind, get awoke
Message in the vines, take notes
These are more than just quotes, this is real life over steel mic
Fuck a norm nigga, just do it if it feels right
Right? Can’t testify this life of mine, I’m so divine bitch
I’m smoking chronics, stoned like Onyx, never third-eyeless
Ancient ways, young ass niggas got knowledge for days
Extraterrestrial, no, not grey, but we do come in peace
What we got to say is that conscious way
With a little bit of ign'ant, word to my pigment
Rock jewels like Rocka motherfucker
But these words from the pyramids, truth I ain't hearin' it
Case stones lower level eat my dust up
The schools ain’t teaching shit, son
Better elevate out of this system
Feeling trapped now the hood carry straps
Watch your back, its Iraq, anyone could be the victim, nigga
