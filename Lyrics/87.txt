Life Worth Living Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put his hands on my face
The kinda touch that made me chase
Him down, like it's true love
So tear me up, tear me down, ooh
Like it was true, oh

With every word that he was sayin'
It got a grip, keep me stayin'
I'm like oh Lord
Pull me in then let me go
Should've known the first time you played with me
Like I was a devil
And I played with you like you were just a man
I wanna lay with you, but I'd never better
From your love, these are the days

[Chorus]
Take what you need, darling
I'm just here for you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (oh)
Give me your love and
Physical affection
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Give me the worst of you to hold
You to take me to the heavens
Give me the best of all your grace
You make life worth living
You make life worth living

[Verse 2]
Babe, I know you're not shy
It's not the first you got me high on expectations
You got a thing for letting me down
Not always around
When I want you to stay with me and make me feel better
There's not a day when I'm not thinkin' of you
So, do you think of me when times are feeling weathered?
It's your love and it's your game
You might also like[Chorus]
Take what you need, darling
I'm just here for you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (oh)
Give me your love and
Physical affection
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Give me the worst of you to hold
You to take me to the heavens
Give me the best of all your grace
You make life worth living
You make life worth living

[Bridge]
Am I highest when you're gone?
Give me a golden, guarded soul
But when I'm crazy and I'm lost
You calm me down, down

[Chorus]
Take what you need, darling
I'm just here for you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (oh)
Give me your love and
Physical affection
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Give me the worst of you to hold
You to take me to the heavens
Give me the best of all your grace
You make life worth living
You make life worth living6Embed
