Dark Star Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've looked a long time to find you
I drifted through the universe, just to lay beside you
Anywhere you want me to take you, I'll go, yeah
But there's things about me that you just don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?
[Chorus]
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart was born out of the fire
I lost love a thousand years ago
And still, I can't find her
Now I don't love like I used to, ohh
But I've got stories I could tell you,
If I want to, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

[Chorus]
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

[Chorus]
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
'Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh10Embed
