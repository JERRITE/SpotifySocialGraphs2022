Makes Me Feel This Way LyricsThere's something about you
I want to be near you
Believe me when I say
That you are the one who

Makes me feel this way
I just wanna play
Music all night long
I'm singing you my song

The way that you move me
The way that you touch me
Your lips and your kisses
I want them cause they always
Make me feel this way
I just wanna play
Music all night long
I'm singing you my song

Feeling good everyday now
I'm on top of the world now
Got a spring in my step babe
Just knowing that you're mine babe
Everybody's looking
Because you're so good-looking
Believe me when I say
That you are the one who

Makes me feel this way
I just wanna play
Music all night long
I'm singing you my song
Music all night long
I'm singing you my song
Music all night long
I'm singing you my song

The way that you move me
The way that you grove me
The way that you reach me
The way that you teach me
Believe me when I say
It's you that makes me wanna playYou might also likeEmbed
