Can’t You See Lyrics[Verse 1: Corbyn Besson]
Girls like you, they just don't understand
Didn't mean harm but you killed a man
Loving you never was in the plan
Stuck in your waves, I sink in your sand

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
Swear I saw it comin'
I'm a fool for wantin’
You don't wanna be rushed
You don't wanna be touched
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to love
Tried to give you my all, but it's not enough
[Chorus: Jack Avery]
Can't you see that I'm falling?
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you?
Show me where your heart is
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you?
Can't you see that I'm honest, and I want this?
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this for you
Can't you see that I'm falling?
I'm falling, falling for you

[Post-Chorus: All]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Falling, falling)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Falling, falling)

[Verse 2: Zach Herron]
And it's crazy the things I would do for us
But the stars don't align, they're not here for us
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to trust
Wish my feelings would turn 'round from love to lust

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
Swear I saw it comin'
I'm a fool for wantin’
You don't wanna be rushed
You don't wanna be touched
It's a shame girls like you don't know how to love
Tried to give you my all but it's not enough
You might also like[Chorus: Jack Avery]
Can't you see that I'm falling?
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you?
Show me where your heart is
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you?
Can't you see that I'm honest, and I want this?
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this, for you
Can't you see that I'm falling?
I'm falling, falling for you

[Interlude: Daniel Seavey]
In my dreams, in my hopes
In my mind, they remind me of you
Should've left when I could, can't get out
I don't know what to do

[Bridge: Daniel Seavey]
You can dig my grave, 'cause I can't be saved
Like a grain of sand lost in a tidal wave
In a broken place, no I can't be traced
Wish you handled my feelings in better ways

[Chorus: Jack Avery & Daniel Seavey]
Can't you see that I'm falling? (Falling for)
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you?
Show me where your heart is (Oh)
Can't you see that I'm falling, falling for you? (Ooh-hoo)
Can't you see that I'm honest, and I want this?
Can't believe that I'm falling, like this for you (Fallin')
Can't you see that I'm falling?
I'm falling, falling for you
[Post-Chorus: Jack Avery, All]
Falling for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh) (Falling, falling)
I'm falling for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Falling, falling)40Embed
