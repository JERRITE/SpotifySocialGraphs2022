Crazy AF Lyrics[Intro: Brady Tutton]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You crazy as fuck
And I think I'm in love

[Verse 1: Michael Conor]
Look, alright
I wake up in the morning
Lipstick written on the wall
"Baby, have a good day
But you know you better call" (Uh, yeah)
Everything just the way she left it
She took my things right off the dresser
Replaced the photo of my ex
That was hanging down the hall, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos]
She's off, I know
But I like her wrong
I lost control a long time ago

[Chorus: Brady Tutton, Drew Ramos]
And every time we play in the sheets
I wake up with her marks all on me
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy
The only kind of girl that's for me
She likes to mark her territory
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Brady Tutton]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You crazy as fuck
And I think I'm in love, haha

[Verse 2: Chance Perez & Sergio Calderon, Michael Conor]
Shows up when she wants
Won't call to say she's on her way
Checking through my phone
Every single time I step away, nah, yeah
And every time that she cook me breakfast
She always hit me with the checklist
"Where you going? Which girls gonna be there?
What time you coming home?"
Man, I don't know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos]
She's off, I know
But I like her wrong
I lost control a long time ago

[Chorus: Brady Tutton & Drew Ramos]
And every time we play in the sheets
I wake up with her marks all on me
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy
The only kind of girl that's for me
She likes to mark her territory
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy, yeah

[Verse 3: Michael Conor]
Uh, look
Now this was back before I even knew a thing
Besides, you were the type I seen up on the movie screen
And even though it's hard to tell her that you got plans
She got a body that'll make a preacher say, "Goddamn" (Goddamn)
Haha, yeah
But through it all, I still love her the same
'Cause you appreciate the sun when it comes after the rain
Take the puddles and just wash 'em away
Nah, I ain't making this up, girl, you crazy as fuck
But damn, I think I'm in love, ha
[Chorus: Brady Tutton, Drew Ramos]
And every time we play in the sheets (Play in the sheets)
I wake up with her marks all on me
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy (She kinda crazy, I think I love her)
The only kind of girl that's for me (Girl that's for me)
She likes to mark her territory
Call me crazy
But I love her crazy, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Brady Tutton & Drew Ramos]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (No other girl for me)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You crazy as fuck
And I think I'm in love, haha4Embed
