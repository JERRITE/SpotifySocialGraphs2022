Hills of Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
You found me in the pedestal light
Un-conquering the spaces between my mind
Decipher what could lay behind
The city, it calls to be mine
So little, the life in my hands
You take it for granted
With its wonders and all of its chances
I never could've imagined it

[Pre-Chorus]
With every other wish for the better
You know I can't stay the king forever
The city is a-calling, the water is a-rushing
Again to a burning door
But I head straight for
[Chorus]
You
With open arms for you
With open arms for you

[Post-Chorus]
We're driving in hills of firе
Can we make it out?
Oh, can we makе it out?
Shall we crash into your desires?
Can we make it out?
Oh, can we make it out?

[Verse 2]
You hold the horses for one last goodbye
The underlying was always a matter of time
Could I be what you had in mind?
But you turn and we're off in the sky
The world was never yours to untie
But shouldn't we, shouldn't we, shouldn't we still try?
Let it be revealed, let it be right
Not so little this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Suddenly every face I forget her
You know I can't stay the king forever
The city is a-calling, the sky is a-rushing
The ceiling, it burst in two
And I head straight for
You might also like[Chorus]
You
With open arms for you
With open arms for you

[Post-Chorus]
We're driving in hills of fire
Can we make it out?
Oh, can we make it out?
Shall we crash into your desires?
Can we make it out? (One, two, three, four)
Oh, can we make it out?

[Outro]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Can we make it out?
Oh, can we make it out?
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Can we make it out?
Oh, can we make it out?
Oh, can we make it out?1Embed
