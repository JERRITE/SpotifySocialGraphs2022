Good Ship Pablo Cruise LyricsThe good ship Pablo Cruise sailed through the straits of Rum Bay
And all of the crew was in search of the music that day
They landed on the beach where the cargo they found
Whole lotta different instruments just to mess around

Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise

They loaded up the cargo and they turned the ship around
And through the wind from on the beach, they hear delightful sound
All the brown-skinned ladies lined along the shore
(Oh, the ladies, man, lookin' good)
Turned that ship around again, do I have to say more?
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise

(Yeah, that's nice)

And all around the island, the people heard the sound
Soon the beach was full of life, dancing all around
They drank and sang and danced away 'cause time don't mean a thing
And as the sun went down on them, you could hear the people sing

Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
(Okay, play another one)

Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
Climb aboard the good ship Pablo Cruise
(Okay, one more, that's it)You might also likeEmbed
