​self sabotage Lyrics[Verse 1]
I tell you to leave when I want you to stay
I'm stuck in my ways, I can't win my own game
If it's meant to be, then I'll throw it away, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll hurt you for no reason, I won't call you back
And I'll break you into pieces so I don't get attached
Get so caught up in my feelings, floatin' 'til we crash
And we're runnin' out of gas, I was hopin' we could last, but
[Chorus]
I start to fall, then I cave
And I push you away
You could call it self-sabotage
I love to dig my own grave
Somethin' wrong with my brain
You could call it self-sabotage
It's a self-fulfillin' prophecy
I know I'm gonna fuck it up with you and me
Shit's never goin' my way
Now I'm drownin' in blame
You could call it self-sabotage

[Verse 2]
I'm hard to love, this girl is a gun
I'm killin' 'em softly, one by one
So fill up your lungs, yeah, you better run, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll hurt you for no reason, I won't call you back
And I'll break you into pieces so I don't get attached
Get so caught up in my feelings, floatin' 'til we crash
And we're runnin' out of gas, I was hopin' we could last, but

[Chorus]
I start to fall, then I cave
And I push you away
You could call it self-sabotage
I love to dig my own grave
Somethin' wrong with my brain
You could call it self-sabotage
It's a self-fulfillin' prophecy
I know I'm gonna fuck it up with you and me
Shit's never goin' my way
Now I'm drownin' in blame
You could call it self-sabotage

Hurt you for no reason, I won't call you back
And I'll break you into pieces so I don't get attached
Get so caught up in my feelings, floatin' 'til we crash
And we're runnin' out of gas, I was hopin' we could last, but

[Chorus]
I start to fall, then I cave
And I push you away
You could call it self-sabotage
I love to dig my own grave
Somethin' wrong with my brain
You could call it self-sabotage
It's a self-fulfillin' prophecy
I know I'm gonna fuck it up with you and me
Shit's never goin' my way
Now I'm drownin' in blame
You could call it self-sabotage3Embed
