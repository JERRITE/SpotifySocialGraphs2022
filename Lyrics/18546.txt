Boomerang Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't really care 'bout what they say
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
I'ma, I'ma come back
[Verse 1]
They can keep talking their talk but I'ma keep walking my walk
And I won't hear a sound
Yeah, they're just trying to see if they can get the best of me
Well, not this time around

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the phone like they're all alone
Hide behind the screen 'cause they're just so mean
But we don't play it like that, we don't even fight back
All of the boys, they just brush it off
Saying we're fake, yeah, no, we're not
Trying to throw us off track
But we know how to come back (hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
I don't really care 'bout what they say
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way (hey, hey, hey)
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
I'ma come back like a boomerang (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
I'ma, I'ma come back
You might also like[Verse 2]
Try to, try to make me stop but I'ma climb it to the top
Just look how far I've gone
Bigger, better, faster, stronger
Yeah, see I ain't just a talker
Catch me if you can, hey
Catch us if you can, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the phone like they're all alone
Hide behind the screen 'cause they're just so mean
But we don't play it like that, what?
We don't even fight back, uh-huh
All of the boys, they just brush it off
Saying we're fake, yeah, no, we're not
Trying to throw us off track, but we know how to come back
Hey, you!

[Chorus]
I don't really care 'bout what they say
I'ma come back like a boomerang, hey, hey!
Won't let the haters get their way
I'ma come back, back, back like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'ma
Try try to throw us off track, hey, hey, hey, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'ma, hey, hey, hey!
We know how to come back, ooh, whoa
I don't really care 'bout what they say
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Won't let the haters get their way
I'ma come back like a boomerang
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ah
I'ma come back, I'ma, I'ma come back
[Outro]
Bigger, better faster stronger
Yeah, see I ain't just a talker
Catch me if you can, hey
Catch us if you can, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!8Embed
