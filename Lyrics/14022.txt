In the Heat of the Morning Lyrics[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
The blazing sunset in your eyes
Will tantalise every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Se√±orita sways, dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like the ragged soldier catching butterflies

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
[Chorus: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow, I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, challenge the trees
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh, I'm so much in love
Like a little boy who races with the wind

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Miles Kane]
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow, I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow, I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morningYou might also likeEmbed
