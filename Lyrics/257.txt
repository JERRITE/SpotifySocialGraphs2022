Money Ain’t A Thing Lyrics[Intro]
(Zino Records, hahahaha)

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Ridin' with them tings
Ridin' through, dash on 'em, switchin' both lanes
Came from the bottom, now it's money ain't a thing
Pounds stackin' up till I'm snappin' rubber bands
Runnin' to the bag, yeah, catch me if you can
Feel like the flyest nigga up in motherland
We like Peter Pan, tell God can never land
Laugh fuckin' haters, I'ma do it all again
Free the gang and my family, all we do is win
[Verse 1: Nines]
Remember when me and Likkle T were broke (Remember those days)
Now I give all the drug dealers hope (I inspire niggas)
Break them off, they're always asking for more
Let's go, I sell bricks fam, you can't get a draw, let's go
Fam, your chain look glass like your jaw, uh
I gave out samples on tour (Trap star shit)
Now all these haters wanna bring it
Cah I just hopped a house with my trainers to live in
I'm a rabbit with the stick (Yeah)
If I'm mackin' your chick
She'll be gone when I spoil her like the back of my whip (Yeah)
Bitches come around, now he's actin' out of character
And I could tell them Cali packs came from Canada (Know the difference)
Fam, I'm still on the block, I ain't a pop star (Out here)
All the crackheads love me, I'm a rockstar
Can't park anywhere, I'm worried 'bout a tracker
I bring my youngens Wireless to rob your favourite rapper
It's Nines

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Ridin' with them tings
Ridin' through, dash on 'em, switchin' both lanes
Came from the bottom, now it's money ain't a thing
Pounds stackin' up till I'm snappin' rubber bands
Runnin' to the bag, yeah, catch me if you can
Feel like the flyest nigga up in motherland
We like Peter Pan, tell God can never land
Laugh fuckin' haters, I'ma do it all again
Free the gang and my family, all we do is win

Don't compare me to them dirty niggas (Nah)
I make more than crack dealers and I flip green (Yeah, yeah)
Of course I made mills before my thirties, nigga
I was wearin' Rollies at sixteen
Me and Midgy, we up, that's a quarter mill
Slipped up, now I gotta watch her take the morning pill
Lookin' like a footballer in these whips I drive (Yeah)
I was wearin' RM's and they was sixty-five
All these niggas here, when I was broke, they weren't around (Yeah)
I coulda been in Top Boy but I turned it down (Sully and them man)
Uh, my whole body lookin' froze (Sub-zero)
After my show, we got a lobby full of hoes, uh
I used to sell packs in the pouring rain (Out here)
When it comes to this trap shit, I'm hall of fame (Harlesden legend)
She see the stars in my roof now she miss me
Bitch, my new car's bulletproof, I come like 50

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Ridin' with them tings
Ridin' through, dash on 'em, switchin' both lanes
Came from the bottom, now it's money ain't a thing
Pounds stackin' up till I'm snappin' rubber bands
Runnin' to the bag, yeah, catch me if you can
Feel like the flyest nigga up in motherland
We like Peter Pan, tell God can never land
Laugh fuckin' haters, I'ma do it all again
Free the gang and my family, all we do is winEmbed
