Just So You Know Lyrics[Refrain]
Just so you know, just so you know
Just—
Girl, I got you whippin'
Got you so open, got you so open
I turn you on, I turn you on
Tell me now, baby, 'cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face

[Verse]
I turn you on like a light switch
Every time you get excited
Every time you wanna ride it
Baby, just ride it
Baby, no one is invited
Maybe your best friend invited
Okay, your girlfriend invited
I like it, I love it
She know that I am head honcho
Better get over here, baby, pronto
You said that you want that new condo
Girl, I better love it
She poppin' non-stop, where her top go?
She hop in the drop and we got ghost
If pronto, I hit like the lotto
Girl, I better love it
She comin' over and, baby, I like it
She pour up tequila and she get excited
She want me to beat it up and I ain't gon' fight it
This shit is gonna get lighted
I'm here with this chick when the night ends
She hang from the sofa
She cannot fight it
Got her rollin' that dope up
Just waitin' to light it
I turn you on
Tell me now, baby, 'cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face
[Refrain]
Just so you know, just so you know
Just—
Girl, I got you whippin'
Got you so open, got you so open
I turn you on (On, on), I turn you on
Tell me now, baby, 'cause I ain't got no time to play
Come over here and put that shit right in my face

[Chorus]
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you, just so you know

[Verse]
I turn you on like a light switch
Every time you get excited
Every time you wanna ride it
Baby, just ride it
Baby, no one is invited
Maybe your best friend invited
Okay, your girlfriend invited
I like it, I love it
She know that I am head honcho
Better get over here, baby, pronto
You said that you want that new condo
Girl, I better love it
She poppin' non-stop, where her top go?
She hop in the drop and we got ghost
If pronto, I hit like the lotto
Girl, I better love it
She comin' over and, baby, I like it
She pour up tequila and she get excited
She want me to beat it up and I ain't gon' fight it
This shit is gonna get lighted
I'm here with this chick when the night ends
