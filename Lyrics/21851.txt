To Make You Feel My Love Lyrics[Verse]
When the rain's blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
[Verse 3]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
It's no doubt in my mind where you belong

[Chorus]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea
Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free
But you ain't seen nothin' like me yet

[Chorus]
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my... loveYou might also like3Embed
