Pulses Lyrics[Intro: Nick Noonan]
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby, this is explosive
Uh, I wanna raise pulses
[Verse 1: Amy Noonan]
I'm coming for your rhythm, I'm here to wake you up
I wanna be your hero, I wanna shake the fluff
I be on that... beatin' in your chest
Check a stethoscope, run a few tests
Something you can measure doesn't make it better
Feeling weighed down, did you lose your go-getter?
You got a heart that's born with a beat
What's that now? You forget how to breathe?
I wanna get that thing runnin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Noonan]
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
Oh, I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure, I'ma make sure
I'ma make sure that you feel alive

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby, this is explosive
Uh, I wanna raise pulses

They run you through the system, they blowing you their smoke
They try to suffocate, but think before you choke
You control the... beatin' in your chest
You resuscitate now, cardiac arrest
World, you can have it, take a couple planets
Trade up your half for the whole pomegranate
You got a heart that's born with a beat
What's that now? You forget how to breathe?
I wanna get that thing running

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Noonan]
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
I wanna make your heart beat
I love it when it beats for me, yeah
Oh, I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure, I'ma make sure
I'ma make sure that you feel alive

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby, this is explosive
Uh, I wanna raise pulses
[Bridge: Nick Noonan]
Oh, I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure that you feel alive
I'ma make sure, I'ma make sure
I'ma make sure that you feel alive

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby, this is explosive, explosive
Uh, I wanna raise pulses
La chica with the most-est
Not in the mood for the average Josephs
Coming unglued, baby, this is explosive
Uh, I wanna raise pulses4Embed
