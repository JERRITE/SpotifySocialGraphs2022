I Cut My Own Hair LyricsI've made a thousand messes
I just keep growing out
I've never been much for your lessons and I'm not gonna start right now

You know what?
I don't care
So I cut
My own hair

I'm writing all your songs and
I'm writing all your books
I'm righting all your wrongs now but I'm sure it won't do any good
You know what?
I don't care
So I cut
My own hair

It's slipped up
So don't bother
You got cut
So don't bother
You're no fun
So don't bother
It's not love
So don't bother

You know what?
I don't care
So I cut
My own hairYou might also likeEmbed
