Eagles Fly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, 9 AM
I saw fire in the sky
I felt my heart pound in my chest
I heard an eagle cry

[Verse 2]
Now I'm alive, I can breathe the air
Feel the wind, smell the earth in the air
I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees
Hey
[Chorus]
Take me away
Come on and fly me away
Take me up so high
Where eagles fly

[Verse 3]
I often dream I sail through the sky
I've always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh, Lord, I could sing

[Chorus]
Hey, take me away
Come on, fly me away
Pick me up so high
Where eagles fly, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I'm alive, I breathe the air
Wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turn, I look, but there's no trace

[Chorus]
Take me away
Come on, fly me away
I wanna fly away
Pick me up so high
Where eagles fly
Oh yeah

Eagles fly, oh, take me away
Eagles fly, oh, take me away
Come on, let's fly away where eagles fly
I wanna fly away, ooh, where eagles flyEmbed
