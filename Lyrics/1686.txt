Doesn't it feel like this could be real life?
If we had somethin’ to prove
Life would be normal, dinner formal
I could be happy with you
Primitive passion, human reactions
Puttin' it all on the line
This could be real life, but why do I feel like
We would be wastin' our time?

[Pre-Chorus: SiR & Sabrina Claudio]
See, it’s the same thing, no rules
Same rhythm, new blues
Same love, but this time it really ain't love
No reason, no rhyme
No speakin' our mind
No war, that isn't what we came for
[Chorus: SiR]
I never wondered what this could be
I just fuck you and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me
I just fuck you and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just fuck you and leave, yeah
There ain't really nothin' to see
That’s why I love you

[Verse 2: Sabrina Claudio]
Couldn’t you picture us givin' into love?
Breakin’ down all of my walls
You would be faithful, honest, and grateful
Probably answer whenever I call
I couldn't handle being disloyal
Unintentionally break us apart
Nor could I measure the level of pressure
I'd be under, protectin' your heart

[Pre-Chorus: SiR & Sabrina Claudio]
See, it’s the same thing, new rules
Same rhythm, new blues
Same love, but this time it really ain't love
No reason, no rhyme
No speakin' our mind
No war, that isn't what we came for

I never wondered what this could be
I sit on it and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me
I sit on it and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just sit on it and leave
There ain't really nothin' to see
That's why I love you

[Bridge: SiR, Sabrina Claudio & Both]
We would be more if I could deal with the pain (But I can't)
Survive another tumble down lover's lane (We remain)
The brightest color in an ocean of grey
Ain't the same if I cared, ain't the same if you stayed
What we were doin' wouldn't make it okay (But how)
Could it be better when we're makin' a wave (No, I)
Don't want your heart if you can take it away
It's a better affair when there's nothing to say
Yeah

[Chorus: SiR, Sabrina Claudio & Both]
I never wondered what this could be (I never wondered what)
I just fuck you and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me (Oh, oh)
I just fuck you and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just fuck you and leave, yeah
There ain't really nothin' to see11Embed
