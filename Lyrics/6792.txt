Walk Upz (Freestyle) Lyrics(YMP Cash)

You better walk what you talk
We do walk ups
That nigga gettin' too jumpy, get chalked up
That hoe ain't nothing she think she done bossed up
(aye) i know some niggas who are rough
You know some niggas who talk tough
Throw dick in that bitch like a ball cup
Yo' shawty swinging her neck like a golf club
Pull up that 44 was under my pro club
Long live my brothers we smokin' on your kush
Chopper might buffer that bitch it is so buff
Act like a fruit now your ass getting rolled up
(aye) I roll up on hot shit, Huey and Riley grandad im gonna pop shit, if you on some opp shit, yo body get dropped make em jump out the cockpit
(ugh) and we do not scrap shit, a nigga want static im grabbin that Glock clip (ugh) I ain't even cappin'
I know everything but I don't tell the cops shit
Walk into Neimans and cop shit don't even shoplift, i tell my niggas I got it
Bitch take a look at my watch wrist, I meant my wrist watch
She shinin' to hard to watch it
(ugh) she shinin' too hard its thomas (ugh) she shinin' to hard it smile
(ugh) I pop a bar now lil' mama i dont know yo name i need to be reminded
Show me where your mind is, she bein' dishonest, not my bitch so I do not mind it
The strap hit like a meteor or a comet, you come see about it or just keep it in the comments
And we won't leave without it, we ain't missing no assignments, long nose on the barrel hit a nigga in his sinus
Shoot like Uganda, I feel like Umaga, my pistol Samoan, as big as your fathers
Scope on a sniper, I don't need binoculars, get hit from a far put my mask on like opera
Send mamacita to shoot up yo casa so yo mama see ya but don't know who got yaYou might also like3Embed
