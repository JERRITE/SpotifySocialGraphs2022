Dreaming (Magic Man Remix) LyricsI see the place that we belong together
Together, like we were something more
And it felt maybe we could last forever
Forever
But you led them to our hideout
They forced their way inside
Now they want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night
Right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send a message
Saying "Give it up, give it up!"
We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-oooh
Ah-aaah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Wait for the dust to settle down around us
Around us, and stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again
To breathe again
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath and calm down
'Cause you have been selected
You've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you got your nest and
You've got your nest and
So live it up, live it up!
We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-oooh
Ah-aaah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-oooh
Ah-aaah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Well, then give it up, give it up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
But you led them to our hideout
They forced their way inside
Now they want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night
Right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send a message
Saying "Give it up, give it up!"
We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-oooh
Ah-aaah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-oooh
Ah-aaah
Please God, tell me we're dreamingYou might also likeEmbed
