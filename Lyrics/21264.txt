Astra Wally LyricsAstra Wally he's a real mean cat
He gets around with caps in his hat
He looks at pain with a nod and a wink
Oh Astra Wally you're a super fun thing

Astra Wally...you super fun thing
Astra Wally...you super fun thing

Astra Wally he's a super cool
Oh when the time we we're goin' to school
He gets around in a Jag Mark 10
Go do a deal Wally, go kill a friend
Go do a deal Wally...kill another friend
Go do a deal Wally...kill another friend

Astra Wally ?? to see
He don't get shot, he go by O.D
The cops catch Wally take the wind from his sails
It ain't too funky comin' down in jail

It ain't funky comin' down

It ain't funky, it ain't funky
It ain't funky, it ain't funky mama

Astra Wally is a real mean cat
He gets around with cat's in his hat
He looks at pain with a nod and a wink
Oh Astra Wally you're a super fun thing
