Bloody Sneakers Lyrics[Chorus: Jared Anthony]
It's time we hit the highway
'Cause with you I'm getting lost
Protect our love at all cost
Another dead and it's all our loss
Red bottoms make 'em dance in bloody sneakers
Got the keys hop in Alicia
Dodging bullets like I dodged the reaper

[Verse 1: Jared Anthony]
I'm so sorry if I'm out of features baby
Had to go focus on me yeah
I used to take these pills just to sleep yeah
But now I'm eating crepes in Peri yuh
I think that you got options, very cautious
No more toxins love
I think that my mosh pit, I can't stop it
But if you fall false to my love
[Chorus: Jared Anthony]
It's time we hit the highway
'Cause with you I'm getting lost
Protect our love at all cost
Another dead and it's all our loss
Red bottoms make 'em dance in bloody sneakers
Got the keys hop in Alicia
Dodging bullets like I dodged the reaper

[Verse 2: Nate Good]
I hear you calling
Through the static on the speaker
When I drive
Got a feeling when I see ya
I could be the reason why
You look up insecurities
They're eating you alive
Girl it sucks, all we're running from
Is running out of time
Drop-dead gorgeous, a sorceress
Pop's dead, she said the voices
In your head could lead you to fortunes yeah
Drop back, there's no need to force it

[Chorus: Jared Anthony]
It's time we hit the highway
'Cause with you I'm getting lost
Protect our love at all cost
Another dead and it's all our loss
Red bottoms make 'em dance in bloody sneakers
Got the keys hop in Alicia
Got the keys and I'm on the highway (Woah)
'Cause with you I'm getting lost
Protect our love at all cost
Another dead and it's all our loss
Red bottoms make 'em dance in bloody sneakers
Got the keys hop in Alicia
Dodging bullets like I dodged the reaperYou might also like1Embed
