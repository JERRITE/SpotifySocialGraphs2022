Not Giving Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Duff]
I'm tryna open up your doors
I know that you've been here before
Girl it's you and me or nothing

[Verse 2: Brooklyn Wyatt]
You cry yourself to sleep at night
I promise you a better life
Relationships are based on loving

[Pre-Chorus: Rye Beaumont]
If I love you they say I should let you go, oh
I'll never let you fly away
[Chorus: Andy Fowler]
I can't deny that you've got my heart on lock
Baby you know I'm yours
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up on you
If there's one thing that I know for sure
Tomorrow I'll love you more
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up on you, on you
On you, on you, on you
Giving up, giving up on you

[Verse 3: Mikey Cobban]
With every look you see his face
He broke your heart, then asked for space
You've got my heart now take the key
I won't let you down girl

[Pre-Chorus: Rye Beaumont]
If I love you they say I should let you go, oh
I'll never let you fly away

[Chorus: Andy Fowler]
I can't deny that you've got my heart on lock
Baby you know I'm yours
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up on you
If there's one thing that I know for sure
Tomorrow I'll love you more
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up on you, on you
On you, on you, on you
Giving up, giving up on you
You might also like[Bridge: Rye Beaumont & Andy Fowler]
Eight billion people but all I see is you
Seven seas of distance but I would swim the blue
Can I take you back? Right back to the start
To a place you're happy, I'll never break your heart

[Outro: Andy Fowler, with Rye Beaumont, Jack Duff, Rye Beaumont]
I can't deny that you've got my heart on lock
Baby you know I'm yours
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up, giving up on you
(Oh, yeah)
If there's one thing that I know for sure
Tomorrow I'll love you more
I'm not giving up, giving up, giving up, giving up
On you, on you
(Oh, oh)
On you, no
On you
(You)
On you
(No)
