Eternity LyricsWhen the end begins
I know that I'll
See you again
Eternity, eternity yeah
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?

See you again

(Would you meet me there?)
There is no way back
I know our time's
Not over yet
Eternity, eternity yeah
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?

See you again
