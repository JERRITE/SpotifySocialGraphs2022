Nellie Lyrics[Verse 1]
Does she wander deep inside her slumber from dream to dream?
What does she dream?
You know you love her, but do you really know her?
I look in her face I know I’m somewhere in there
But, she’s somebody else. She’s somebody new
And I can’t help myself from going wandering with her from room to room
Today, tomorrow, today

[Chorus]
Oh Nellie, oh Nellie, oh Nellie, yeah
Oh Nellie, oh Nellie, oh Nellie, yeah
[Verse 2]
Does she wander deep inside her slumber from dream to dream?
What does she dream?
Oh to hold her, so happy just to know her
I got an old notebook, it’s filled with bits and baubles
I wanna tighten it up and put it in her room between the hyacinth
And the book of Aesop’s fables. I wanna go there soon
Today, tomorrow, today
