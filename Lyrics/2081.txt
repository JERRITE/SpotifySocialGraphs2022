TranslationsEspañolItalianoStarting Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
In and out of focus, moments that I keep
Something for the pain and something so I sleep
Won't you comfort me? Warm the air that I breathe
Visceral in doses, hidin' in the seams
Standin' on the sun and I don't feel a thing
Won't you comfort me? Take the fear I don't need

[Chorus]
I wake up every mornin' with the years ticking by
I'm missin' all these memories, maybe they were never mine
I feel the walls are closin', I'm runnin' out of time
I think I missed the gun at the starting line
[Verse 2]
Tell me, am I brokеn? I can never leavе
Bitin' on my tongue and checking if it bleeds
Oh, is it lost on me, all the things I believe?
Something like an omen I can never keep
Movin' on and on, so very bittersweet
Is it lost on me, all the things I don't need?

[Chorus]
I wake up every mornin' with the years ticking by
I'm missin' all these memories, maybe they were never mine
I feel the walls are closin', I'm runnin' out of time
I think I missed the gun at the starting line

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Take me alive, make me a liar, take me alive
Don't look away until it's gone, till it's gone
Take me alive, make me a liar, take me alive
Don't look away until it's gone, till it's gone

[Chorus]
I wake up every mornin', the years ticking by
I'm missin' all these memories, maybe they were never mine (Ah)
I feel the walls are closin', I'm runnin' out of time
I think I missed the gun at the starting line

[Outro]
Take me alive, make me a liar, take me alive
Don't look away until it's gone, till it's gone
Take me alive, make me a liar, take me alive
Don't look away until it's gone, till it's gone18Embed
