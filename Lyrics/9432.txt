Play the Game Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
You think that something's happening
And it's bigger than your life
But it's only what you're hearing
Will you still remember?
When the morning light has come
Will the songs be playing over and over
Till you do it all over again?

[Chorus]
Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right?
Is it worth the time?, is it worth the price?
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight?
Then play the game tonight
[Verse 2]
And when the curtains open
To the roaring of the crowd
You will feel it all around you
Then it finally happens
And it's all come true for you
And the songs are playing over and over
Till you do it all over again

[Chorus]
Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right?
Is it worth the time?, is it worth the price?
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight?
Then play the game tonight

[Bridge]
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right?
Is it worth the time?, is it worth the price?
Do you see yourself in the spotlight?

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right?
Is it worth the time?, is it worth the price?
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight?
