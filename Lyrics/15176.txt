Capsized Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now when you wake up
Night's falling someone is by your side
Pull it together, darling you're not alone

But when you break up
Sky's falling, no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

[Chorus]
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
Just keep your lamp on

[Verse 2]
Now he's a dyin' bed maker
He's a dyin' bed maker Jesus gonna make my...
It's a holy ghost, holy ghost religion
It's a holy ghost religion Jesus gonna make my...

[Chorus]
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

[Verse 1 (Reprise with variation)]
And when you wake up
Night's falling, someone is by your side
Pull it together, darling you're not alone

But when you break up
Sky's falling, no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

[Chorus]
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
