Listening to Sade Lyrics[Chorus: PLS STOP JAMES]
I ain't comin' all this way to see nobody else
All these memories been goin' while I'm by myself
I ain't too big to admit that I'ma need some help
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to Sade

[Verse 1: PLS STOP JAMES]
I gave up my whole week just to give you Valentine's
Spend each mom–µnt with you just to over-analyze
One month in, I start to see them baby mamma eyes
Girl, now I am traumatized, out here with some other guy
Take this to my grave, I don't think I'll be the same
Girl, lowkey, I feel you missin' that attention that you crave
Spent that weekend with your grandma, now you puttin' me through pain
Girl, why won't you let me love you? 'Cause I made a few mistakes?
And I make up what I'm missin' and one day you finna say
"Man, he might be what I wanted but know damn I got away
Man, I should've paid attention to that look up on his face
Should've caught him while he fallin', 'cause now he fallin' away"
[Chorus: PLS STOP JAMES]
I ain't comin' all this way to see nobody else
All these memories been goin' while I'm by myself
I ain't too big to admit that I'ma need some help
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to Sade

[Verse 2: Jez Dior]
Let me see what kind of lovin' you got shorty
Wanna feel your skin and listen to some Sade
I don't care if you're only [?] like party
Wanna eat you up like Mexican nopales
All these dudes, you be ghostin' 'em
Too bad I am not like most of 'em
You a drug, I need a dose of it
Back and forth like I'm playin' Djokovic
Smooth, so who's so in it?
Oh so, am I so? Get it
No cap, you just fit it
My windows stay tinted
Car all black, black
I see the light though
6am and I'm about to score like Fiko
AP on my wrist, yeah you see it, goin' psycho
That's what she like though
I think I might go
Yeah
You might also like[Chorus: PLS STOP JAMES]
I ain't comin' all this way to see nobody else
All these memories been goin' while I'm by myself
I ain't too big to admit that I'ma need some help
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to Sade
Sade, Sade
Let me love you while we listening to SadeEmbed
