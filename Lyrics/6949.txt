What a Lie Lyrics[Verse 1]
User, what a user
A blessing, learning lessons
A season for entertaining leechers
My poison was your peaches
Could've saved my time, should've taken my space
That's what needed my attention, not your fuckin' face
Wish I read between the lines you were readin' me
Such an actor, what you were after was the industry

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't believe I caught you that night
Saw the messages in plain sight
How you never thought to delete?
Like you wanted me to read them now
[Chorus]
And it blows my mind
Happened overnight
What a lie I fell for this time, ooh

[Verse 2]
User, what a loser
No one will ever know how much I put you on
All they'll ever know is how you a sing a song, but
What kind of a man makes you part of his marketing plan?
Ooh, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't believe I caught you that night
Saw the messages in plain sight
How you never thought to delete?
Like you wanted me to read them now

[Chorus]
And it blows my mind
Happened overnight (It happened)
What a lie I fell for this time, ooh
And it blows my mind
Happened overnight (It happened)
What a lie I fell for this time, ooh

Money, moved on
My love, you lost
You mad, so sad
Fuck you, I'm gone
I'll be away, this other day
Get out my way
Can't talk, go away
Look at my view
Of someone new
All that I do
It's without you
It's without you
It's without you
It's without you
It's withoutâ€”
It's without you
Without you
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And it blows my mind
Happened overnight (It happened)
What a lie I fell for this time
And it blows my mind
Happened overnight (Night)
What a lie I fell for this time, oohEmbed
