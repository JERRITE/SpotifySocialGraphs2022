Red Lights Lyrics[Verse 1: RINI]
Drivin' with my windows down tonight
On my way to you, yeah
I’m rollin' while I'm whippin’ in this ride
I'll be there real soon

[Pre-Chorus 1: RINI]
She said don't rush, the night's still young
Oh, we can take our time
I just hope that it's enough to make her mine
[Chorus: RINI]
I just can't wait to get there
I'm catchin' red lights every time
I stop, I lose my patience
Can I make you my lady now?

[Verse 2: RINI]
I want you in my arms now
Keep daydreamin’ of us
Dancin’ on the moon (The moon)
Forget about everything for now (For now)
Focus on me and you

[Pre-Chorus 2: RINI]
Her name a star (A star)
She lights my world like candles in the night
I just hope it last 'til morning sunrisе

[Chorus: RINI]
I just can’t wait to get there
I'm catchin' rеd lights every time
I stop, I lose my patience
Can I make you my lady now?

[Verse 3: Wale]
Look, what you gon' say? What you gon’ do?
What you really lose if she really, really lose you?
What you gon' pay? Bet she going through
The whole bank account that she got, if she lose you
I don't trust women, it's the thug in me
Tell the best woman not to really fuck with me
Just lust for me, just mess with me
Just touch me and leave, don't talk to me (Talk to me)
I get lost in the moment, I be gone in public
So close to the game, gave Wall a bucket
Gave Beal a "ooh" for my lil' boo
Belaire in the fridge, got the will to do it
Gotta real, real low profile
Goyard mask know I still don't smile (Smile)
Do it for the bag 'fore I do it for a bow
Red lights on, but it still won't stop
Gone, Folarin
You might also like[Chorus: RINI]
I just can't wait to get there (Ooh, yeah)
I'm catchin' red lights every time
I stop, I lose my patience
There's only one thing on my mind
The way you make me feel, yeah
Is something that's so hard to find
This feelin' drives me crazy
Can I make you my lady now?Embed
