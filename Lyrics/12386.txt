TranslationsTürkçeGoodbye, For Now Lyrics[Intro]
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe, maybe

[Verse 1]
Maybe we could meet again as strangers
Start over, get to know each other
Make another first impression
'Cause it turns out I don't know you that well
Maybe we could fall in love again
But, maybe this time, we'll end up as friends
But if we keep trying in this moment
I know it will surely be the end
[Chorus]
So, I'll say goodbye for now
I don't know for how long
But the time has come that we don't get along
So, goodbye for now

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of feeling like the bad guy
And you're tired of making me cry
We could try this at another time
But I think that we could both use some space
For a few weeks, months, maybe a year
I could work on myself, you focus on your career
It's kinda scary, the futures so unclear
But you're not the man I need you to be

[Chorus]
So, I'll say goodbye for now
I don't know for how long
But the time has come that we don't get along
So, goodbye for now

[Bridge]
We're so much the same but we're so damn different
Fought through the pain didn't make a difference
Drive me insane how you're so indifferent
And I don't wanna waste your time

Love's got nothing to do with this
Love's not enough to go through with this
Love alone won't make our problems go away
So I'm sorry but I've gotta say

[Chorus]
I gotta say goodbye for now
I don't know for how long
But the time has come that we don't get along
So, goodbye for now
But the time has come that we don't get alone
So, goodbye for now

[Outro]
So I'll say goodbye for3Embed
