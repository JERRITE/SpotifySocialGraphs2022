Father Forgive Me Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yup

[Verse 1]
Okay, okay, okay
Got marijuana all in my palms
Got honey mustard all on my jeans
Got Based God slappin' in my car
Whole block yellin' "Fuck KD"
Got a list full of all my wrongs
Tryina right 'em 'fore my god take me
Got a scraper and I'm ready, rolling hella fuckin' heavy
Through the city screaming, "Forgive me"
Got commas coming, you can bet on that
Used to run around, let my headphones slap
Used to hit them licks with all my friends and then
My big homie pawn that shit, then we split that cash
Used to sit in back, sending texts like, "Hey
Take a pic of that, send that shit my way"
Used to talk big game like, "Bitch, run my fade"
But I'm soft as fuck, you know my ass got laid
The fuck I let go, got beefs calling my mom
She give me them whoopings when I get her home
Like I didn't just get my ass beat at the park
But it's cool, swear it's cool, I get love, now I'm on that
She come to the shows and take shots with the fans
Got licked from the belt when got caught with the grams
Now I burn 'em with confidence all on my porch
You come home and I'm grown and I do it all for it
Singing
[Chorus]
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father, forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father, forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today

[Bridge]
If I die before I wake, if I go before you do
Pray to god my family's straight
I'll pass 'em down a house or two
My grandson know his papa was a fuckin' legend in these streets
They play me out apartment windows
Soundtrack every metro seat

[Verse 2]
Tapatio still on my popcorn
Ride around, still calling shotgun
Never really gave the homies gas money
But I'm whipping, now I'm screaming that I got us
'Cause the homies, they knew
I had something special, and I knew it, too
I tell 'em to give me some time when we all gon' be straight
Gon' be hoes at them shows, and a boat for the lake
Ah damn, oh god, now daddy say we warriors
We from the rez, we beat that cancer, beat addiction, fuck with us
We let too many dudes with no money talk, it was failin'
So, I'm silent when I move and the numbers speak for me now
I'm coming
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father, forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father, forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today

[Outro]
I'm coming home, make a place for me
Let the love inside, take the hate in me
Father, forgive me
Father, father for my ways
If yesterday was wrong, I'll write 'em down today4Embed
