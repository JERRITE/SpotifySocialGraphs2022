TranslationsPortuguêsBetween Us Lyrics[Verse 1: Jade]
When the curtains close and all of the lights go down
Safe to say I'll stay, I will always stick around
And I will fix your crown
And if you're knocked, I'm your rock
I won't stop, you will never be in doubt, in doubt

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
Like, damn, we got history
Shared every misery
Lived every victory
Yeah, we got synergy
If they hurt you, they hurting me
That's just the way it be
We walked through the fire
And as the flames got higher
It made us survivors
Yeah, it made us fighters, fighters
[Chorus: Perrie]
So here's my vow
Starting from herе and now
Nothing comes between us
Nothing comes bеtween us
I swear that we won't lose this thing we've found
'Cause love will never leave us
Nothing comes between us, between us

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie]
Us, us, us
(Nothing comes between us)
Us, us, us

[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne, Jade, Perrie]
Remember the day when we finally found our wings?
It changed our lives, gave us power to do anything (Anything)
And every time they break us down (Break us down)
Huh, we bounce back, every track, had your back
So you'll never be in doubt (Never be in), doubt

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie, Jade, Leigh-Anne]
Damn, we got history (Yeah)
And all these sweet melodies (Yeah)
Lived every victory
