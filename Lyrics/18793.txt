Blunt Force Trauma Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blunt Force Trauma
I'm picking it up
You bring it on down
I gotta get out tonight ’cause I'm sick of sticking around
You say it ain't cool
I say it’s all fine
You better go suck it up 'cause I had enough of your whine

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, what can I say?
You can't fight love, but we'll try anyway
Don't you know we're the king and queen of drama
You call it love, I call it Blunt Force Trauma
[Verse 2]
I'm making my mind
You make it undone
I make it back up again 'cause I’m all done having no fun
You say you don’t mind
I say you don't care
I gotta get out tonight ’cause this love ain't going nowhere
All the boundaries go like a domino
Gotta shake you off of my case
Like a shooting star
You take it to far
You need to get out of my space

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, what can I say?
You can't fight love, but we'll try anyway
Don’t you know we're the king and queen of drama
You call it love, I call it Blunt Force Trauma

[Bridge]
Our kinda love is a violent case
Our kinda love has a bitter sweet taste
Our kinda love is a kick in the face

[Verse 3]
So I'm picking it up
You bring it on down
I gotta get out tonight 'cause I'm sick of sticking around
You say you don't mind
I say it's all fine
You better go suck it up 'cause I had enough
And I had enough
And I had enough
And you had enough of my time
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, what can I say?
You can't fight love, but we'll try anyway
Yeah we know we're the king and queen of drama
You call it love, I call it Blunt Force Trauma
Oh yeah, whoo ahaha
Oh yeah
Blunt Force Trauma
