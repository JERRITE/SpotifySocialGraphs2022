Send In The Machines Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been feeling numb, losing all my sanity
I don't even know what I've got underneath
Open up my chest, my heart don't even beat
Sick and tired of people telling me just what I need

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be human anymore
Take my flesh and bone, leave it at the door
World's on fire and we don't even bleed
We're all numb so take a seat
Send in the machines
[Verse 2]
The doctors medicating all of our pain away
They program a smile across my ugly face
They say lifе's a dream so why am I awake?
It's like thеy gave us hearts just knowing they would break

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be human anymore
Take my flesh and bone, leave it at the door
World's on fire and we don't even bleed
We're all numb so take a seat
Send in the machines

[Bridge]
Send in, send in the machines, yeah
Send in, send in the machines, yeah
Send in, send in the machines
They're faster than they seem, they're coming for your dreams, yeah
Send in, send in the machines, yeah
Send in, send in the machines, yeah
Send in, send in the machines
They're faster than they seem, they're coming for your dreams, yeah

[Outro]
Send in the machines
I don't wanna be human anymore
I don't wanna be human anymoreYou might also like1Embed
