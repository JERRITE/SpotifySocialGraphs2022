Alone Lyrics[Chorus]
Woah, I'm so alone
It's like everybody left without me
Woah, I'm letting go
Feel the headlights crashing, my life flashing

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm so alone
It's like everybody left without me
Woah, I'm letting go
Feel the headlights crashing, my life flashing
[Verse]
I see you on my screen, are you just a fantasy?
Maybe you're not even there
Maybe you don't even care
As I stare at my phone
Thinking you could be the one
And I'm done waiting, hesitating

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, I'm so alone
It's like everybody left without me

[Chorus]
Woah, I'm so alone
It's like everybody left without me
Woah, I'm letting go
Feel the headlights crashing, my life flashingYou might also like2Embed
