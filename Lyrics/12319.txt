30/30-150 Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a dominant gene, live as I die
Never say forever 'cause forever's a lie
I can see right through you so I can ignore you
The story changes but the ending won't bore you
I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
They didn't listen so they threw you away
Now all you do is talk, I don't want to hear your bullshit
Is this what you want?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends
[Chorus]
They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all clearly alive
We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers
30/30-150 hates

[Verse 2]
In my own peculiar way I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don't know the when
You want to live in a one-sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now it's the grand facade
I don't want to be an angel
I just want to be God

[Chorus]
They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all clearly alive
We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers
30/30-150 hates
Hates

I am a fucking machine fueled by the past
A memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold
Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't want to have it all
I just want to have enough

[Pre-Chorus]
This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

[Chorus]
They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all clearly alive
We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers
