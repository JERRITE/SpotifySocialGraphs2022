Heart of Steel Lyrics[Verse 1]
A lone survivor wanders on
A warrior on the path of war
To save the only one he loves
Tormented soul against all odds

[Chorus]
In a mayhem of demons and fire
In the rage of the howling storm
One and all to the final trial
In the hope of a brand new dawn
For the heart, for the pride and for vengeance
In a nightmare of dark and screams
Holding on to the promise and their quest
Unified through the last ordeal
[Verse 2]
A hero walks alone no more
A gentle hand to break his fall
The ties of love will be his shield
His fate at last will be revealed

[Chorus]
In a mayhem of demons and fire
In the rage of the howling storm
One and all to the final trial
In the hope of a brand new dawn
For the heart, for the pride and for vengeance
In a nightmare of dark and screams
Holding on to the promise and their quest
Unified through the last ordeal
Unified in the fortune's wheel
Unified for a golden dream
With a heart of steel

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Here comes the land, here comes the time
Long live the man, forsake the child
A wounded soul to take back home
A higher cause to pledge his sword
You might also like[Chorus]
In a mayhem of demons and fire
In the rage of the howling storm
One and all to the final trial
In the hope of a brand new dawn
For the heart, for the pride and for vengeance
In a nightmare of dark and screams
Holding on to the promise and their quest
Unified through the last ordeal
In a mayhem of demons and fire
In the rage of the howling storm
One and all to the final trial
In the hope of a brand new dawn
For the heart, for the pride and for vengeance
In a nightmare of dark and screams
Holding on to the promise and their quest
Unified through the last ordeal
Unified in the fortune's wheel
Unified for a golden dream
With a heart of steelEmbed
