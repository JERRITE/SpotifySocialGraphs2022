I2I (Eye To Eye) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got myself a notion
It's one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion
By reachin' out for each other's hand
Maybe we'll discover
What we should've known all along
One way or another
Together's where we both belong

[Chorus]
If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eye
Eye to eye
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eye
[Verse 2]
If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us, yeah
And find a way to bring me to you

[Chorus]
If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eye
Eye to eye, yeah
Eye to eye, hey
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eye
Eye to eye
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eye

[Outro]
If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is the reason why
For the first time we're seeing it eye to eyeYou might also likeEmbed
