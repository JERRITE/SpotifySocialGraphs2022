Silver Heat Lyrics[Refrain]
Watching your reflection in the window screen
Walking long the pavement in the silver heat
Foot slaps the ground twice, over and over
A sound passes by your left shoulder

[Verse 1]
Frozen fingers
Sweaty palms
Transfer an image
Onto her heart
[Chorus]
You're on the street below my window
Calling me down
You've got your bare feet on the dashboard
I'm running out of solid ground
She keeps a picture in her left breast pocket
In case he comes back
Oh forget that boy, come on now drop it
I want to see you again
Aah

[Refrain]
Watching your reflection in the window screen
Walking 'long the pavement in the silver heat
Foot slaps the ground twice, over and over
A sound passes by your left shoulder

[Verse 2]
Sunken eyelids
Closed and wet
You've been crying
I told you to forget

[Chorus]
You're on the street below my window
Calling me down
You've got your bare feet on the dashboard
I'm running out of solid ground
She keeps a picture in her left breast pocket
In case he comes back
Oh forget that boy, come on now drop it
I want to see you again
Aah
You might also like[Chorus]
You're on the street below my window
Calling me down
You've got your bare feet on the dashboard
And I'm running out of solid ground
She keeps a picture in her left breast pocket
In case he comes back
Oh forget that boy, come on now drop it
I want to see you again

[Refrain]
Watching your reflection in the window screen
Watching your reflection in the window screen
Walking 'long the pavement in the silver heat
I want to see you again
AahEmbed
