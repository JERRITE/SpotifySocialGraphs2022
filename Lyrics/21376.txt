Easy Livinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is a thing I've never known before
It's called easy livin'
This is a place I've never seen before
And I've been forgiven

[Chorus]
Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've
Taken your place in my heart
[Verse 2]
Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find ya
Day after day on that windy road
I had walked behind ya

[Chorus]
Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've
Taken your place in my heart

[Bridge]
Waiting, watching
Wishing my whole life away
Dreaming, thinking
Ready for my happy day
And some easy livin'

[Verse 3]
Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find you
Day after day on that windy road
I had walked right behind you

[Chorus]
Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've
Taken your place in my heart
You might also like[Outro]
Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've
Taken your place in my heart1Embed
