Into Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sky turns to a different shade of blue
After the rain
My mind turns to a different point of view
After the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
I know
[Chorus]
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday

[Verse 2]
Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
After the rain
And all those doubts have drifted out of view
After the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
Oooh... my mind
I know

[Chorus]
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday

[Bridge]
La dee da...
La dee da...

Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday

[Outro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Into yesterday
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uhEmbed
