Far From Home (The Raven) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sending a raven
Black bird in the sky
Sending a signal that I'm here
Some sign of life
I'm sending a message
Of feathers and bone
Just let me know I'm not forgotten
Out here alone

[Pre-Chorus]
The air is cold
The night is long
I feel like I might fade into the dawn
Fade until I'm gone
[Chorus]
I'm so far from home
So far from home
Not where I belong
Not where I belong
I'm so far from home
So far from home

[Verse 2]
I'm sending a raven
With blood on its wings
Hoping it reaches you in time
And you know what it means
'Cause out here in the darkness
And out of the light
If you get to me too late
Just know that I tried

[Chorus]
I'm so far from home
So far from home
Not where I belong
Not where I belong
I'm so far from home
So far from home
So far
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
The air is cold
The night is long
I feel like I might fade into the dawn
Fade until I'm gone

[Chorus]
I'm so far from home
So far from home
Not where I belong
Not where I belong
I'm so far from home
So far from home
Not where I belong
Not where I belong

[Outro]
So far from home
Not where I belong
I'm so far from home6Embed
