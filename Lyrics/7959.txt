If There Is Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
These secrets are burning through my tongue
I tried to swallow them all
Like they're the breath in my lungs
"Just hold on," you begged of me
Sew my bones to my skin
I'm racing toward my end
I don't have to close my eyes to see what haunts me
My mortal agony
Taunting so endlessly
Tie me to the stake
I'm dreaming wide awake
[Pre-Chorus]
Have I lost my way?
Will I accept this is my fate? I am powerless
With my head in the clouds
But I'm not looking down

[Chorus]
I thought you had more faith in me
You watched me burn so shamelessly, I am powerless
To all these dying things I love, I am broken
I am broken

[Verse 2]
Innocence feels so far from me
If I could take this back
God, I'd take it back
You can't return the spoils of war you keep
There are no silver linings
Only a bullet through the heart
Yeah
(Only a bullet through the heart, through the heart)
If there is love (If there is love)
In all of us (In all of us)
I guess it's only for ourselves (Ourselves)

[Pre-Chorus]
Have I lost my way?
Will I accept this is my fate? I am powerless
With my head in the clouds
But I'm not looking down
You might also like[Chorus]
I thought you had more faith in me
You watched me burn so shamelessly, I am powerless
To all these dying things I love, I am broken
I am broken
So you can throw me to the flames
Just to burn for your mistakes
I have nothing left
Through the heart we were once the same
Through the heart we were once the same

[Bridge]
I could watch every well run dry
But that could never rinse this blood from your hands
'Cause through the heart we were once the same
But your pride dragged you
Into the fucking grave

[Outro]
If there is love in all of us
I guess it's only for ourselves
If there is love in all of us
I guess it's only for ourselvesEmbed
