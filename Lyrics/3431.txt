20 Years Later Lyrics[Intro]
Twenty years later, somewhere far across the ocean
Here I am, chillin' with the homies on some grown shit
Thank God that I made it this—
On some grown
Twenty years later, somewhere far across the ocean
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now it's twenty years later, somewhere far across the ocean
Here I am, chillin' with the homies on some grown shit
Thank God that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver, then I would've crashed the car (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the beach boy comin' through the city goin' hard
I got big money callin', I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart (Yeah, woah)
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart
[Verse 1]
I got rich hoes with me and they don’t know who you are
They say, "Yung Pinch, why you such a goddamn star?"
Poppin' bottles at the club, gettin' more drinks at the bar
These hoes showin' love, put the whole thing on they card, wait
What you mad for? I know bad hoes, on some boss shit
They get cash flow
Do your own thing, see how that goes
That’s what I did, yeah, that’s what I did

[Chorus]
Now it’s twenty years later, somewhere far across the ocean
Thank God that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver, then I would've crashed the car (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the beach boy comin' through the city goin' hard
I got big money callin', I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart (Yeah, woah)
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart

[Verse 2]
Used to be the homie, now we on our own shit
Don't know who you are now
Switched on who you roll with
Don't act like you know me, don't act like you know shit
Don't act like we friends now, boy, you on that ho shit
Hatin' on the low shit, talk the most shit
Say you wanna see me win, I know you don't, bitch
Remember they ain't like me, now they act just like me
Ran off with my old steez, tryna dress just like me
I see all that fuck shit, ain’t shit gettin' by me
Used to wanna fight me (Well, pussy boy, come try me)
I'm with all that fuck shit, actin' like you talk shit
New homies really with the shits and they gon' bust quick
No, I am not tough, bitch, I care about my safety
No, you can’t replace me, hell no, you can’t replace me
'Cause I want this forever, yeah, forever
I got all these bands in my hands might change the weather
Knew shit would get better, I just needed faith
Slide it back home, boy, you know I'm gon' be safe
Look at where I'm at now, this shit feel like fate, yeah
Look at where I'm at now, you can't pass the gate
You might also like[Chorus]
Now it's twenty years later, somewhere far across the ocean (Yeah, oh-woah)
Here I am, chillin' with the homies on some grown shit (Yeah, woah)
Thank God that I made it this far
If it wasn't for my driver, then I would've crashed the car(Yeah, oh-woah)
It's the beach boy comin' through the city goin' hard
I got big money callin', I'm just tryna play it smart
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart (Yeah, oh-woah)
Play it smart, I'm just tryna play it smart

[Outro]
Matics on the wave
Yeah, oh-woah5Embed
