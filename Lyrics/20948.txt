Demo1 Lyrics[Verse 1]

I just wanna own me an island like Maui (ooo)
Picked my fair share of that poison and now we move
Started from the depths of the gutter, oh how we grew
How many times rappers pree’d our session and how we move?

Numerous, paid our credit and now it’s due
Bonafide, heard them talking, I doubt it’s true
Used to pour a four of the lean with a Mountain Dew
Soon as we shipped the bad habits and schemed, the mountain grew
Organise then broaden minds, yeah that’s the onus
Grammy looks and fine dining, it’s all a bonus
If we never had leverage, they wouldn’t phone us
I go beast mode, see Godzilla that’s my patronus

They got high hopes and low skill, this shit audacious
Dream cribs with high ceilings, I need it spacious
Sh*tted on us, through the come up, like they was Jesus
When they fall off, Lord help 'em, it wasn’t gracious

When there’s suttin for' em, these n*ggas is buddy, buddy
All they care about? What you smoking and cuddy, cuddy
Check that Lucozade, that's bro's if it’s bloody muddy
I write novel-esque, want my spot? Gotta study, study

I don’t hide intentions, rumour has it that’s bad business
When I needed pops, all he needed mad Guinness
Need my n*ggas leg', street tales got a sad finish
There’s been cold nights, hot summers and bad dinners


[Verse 2]

In the summer by the stove
My bro was grinding, he just want a summer by the cove
I just love when we evolve
N*ggas tried to son me like they're stunna but I’m HOV
I was watching for them ones that I say love ya when they loathe
You might also likeProblems that I face, I couldn’t run instead of solve
Gotta suck it up, my DNA was blooded with resolve
Dreams and reality, we running from them both
Stunted when I planted seeds, now you stunting on my growth

I had dreams tryna be up on Dreamville
Lost a little drive, sticky patch like a lean spill
They ain't even heard 5 percent what I been killed
If music is a drug then n*gga I got the fiends thrill

Severed couple ties they gon' see that it’s their loss
Tryna reap rewards when they ain’t covered the bare costs
YFrozone, I cover booths inna bare frost
I told 'em move aside, this rap sh*t I’m the heir boss


[Verse 3]

That’s why they always love me on these beats
I’m like honey to these sweets
They gon' play me in the meetings and still love me in the streets
If I feature I can’t let a n*gga son me on these beats
For the fans only, but I’m never scummy with the tweets (ooo)

Machines tryna control us but yeah we still loading
Golden boy from a grey city like Phil Foden
God flow, from the Anglia but I’m still Odin
One eye on the prize, my report's still coding

Don’t mind I, I’m getting high like it’s Sinaloa
I’m still static my Illmatic is in my blower
I need mine coz father time, it ain’t getting slower
The game the same, but I can tell that your settings lower

I couldn’t tell you why n*ggas lie by the day
They gon' catch my sh*t late like I was live with delay
I’m James Harden, my teammates alright with the play
So ima shoot until the lights go off and die by my way

And I put myself up there with Biggie
It ain’t a biggie
I make a beat in 20 minutes while I wrap the ziggy
Can't always be the Steph or Klay, but I can play the Iggy
Kush smoker, wouldn’t see me ever flame a ciggy

I need my credit and my payment, please don’t take take the mickey
I make the beats 'coz when I’m searching I was way too picky
I used to stay up in the studio then fake a sickie
I'm infectious with the sauce, man you know I make it sticky (ooo)

(Yeah)Embed
