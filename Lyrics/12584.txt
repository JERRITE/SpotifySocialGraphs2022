I Saw You Close Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey now, is it the dawn or the end?
The hours we talked
You wished we'd stopped
Acting like it's nothing at all
In the first act, your gun on the wall
The kick back into your
Shoulder was always hard to ignore, hey

[Chorus]
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
[Verse 2]
Hey now, the slip, the doubt, the itch
You bow so long to live beyond
Now you walk in, humming your song
Mirror in the bathroom, nails getting long
Ah please, tell me I'm wrong
In the third act, it's gotta go off, hey

[Chorus]
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyesYou might also like1Embed
