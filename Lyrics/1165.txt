Young Money
Kissin' strangers

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Ayy, I'm just tryna make my way out through the concrete jungle, who walks with me?
Ayy, oh, yeah, tryna find connection in two-thousand somethin', ain't easy

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Woo-hoo, can't quit, take sips, wanna taste you
Make wish, use lips, kissin' strangers
[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I trust
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Open heart, open mind, never know who you'll find
Open heart, close your eyes, kissin' strangers
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Ayy, all misinformation open to interpretation, just keep searchin'
Me, hyperventilatin', blockin' up my circulation, no waitin'

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Woo-hoo, can't quit, take sips, wanna taste you (Yeah)
Make wish (Yeah), use lips (Oh), kissin' strangers

Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I trust
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I got a boy that I kinda like
This is a kiss-kiss, tongue-him-down kind of night
He got that mmm-mmm, hard, got that China white
He got that bomb, I think I'ma call him dynamite
I got a lot of sons, I could show you all the sonograms
Me? I'm Jem and these bitches is the holograms
Me? I win and these bitches just lose
They ship sink, but my ship, it just cruise
Anyway, I’m back with my baby gat, gimme piggyback
Drip-drip, where that kitty cat? Put it in his lap
Sip-sip on the tip-tip, lick on his lip-lip
I think he tryna hit young Nick' like a quick pick

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nicki Minaj, Joe Jonas]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers
Ooh (Ah), na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers (Hey)
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I trust
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers (Ah)
[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nicki Minaj]
Open heart, open mind, never know who you'll find
Open heart, close your eyes, kissin' strangers
Ooh (Ooh), na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 'til I find someone I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, kissin' strangers (Ooh)21Embed
