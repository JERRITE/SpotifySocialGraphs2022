Nothing Changed Lyrics[Intro: Quavo & Takeoff]
Yeah, yeah
Durel made the beat, I'ma rock with it
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, ooh

[Chorus: Quavo]
Don't nothin' change but the chains (Woah)
We on ya head like a bang (Bang)
All double R's, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (Stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (Gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (Ring)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign, foreign)
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Run it up, that's it (Run it up)
M&M's, whole tick (Whole tick)
Don't mind if I do it, I get it, I love my brothers, I split it (Split it)
Lil' nigga, mind ya business, cause I got somе guns, they hitting (Hitting)
Trap out the bando, just choppin' the chickеns
And now I'm on top of the city (City)
Designer mismatching, yeah, the money do backflips, yeah
I flip the mattress, (Flip it) I pivot my glasses, yeah
I upped the status, now she lookin' like an actress, yeah (Woo)
This a big ol' bag and we gon' fuck up Magic (Yeah)
And we got a hunnid round mag, (Shoot) to clear out the madness (Grah)
I'm the Huncho to my people and I cannot go out the saddest (No)
Don't need no money counter, cause I think my fingers count the fastest (Cash)
No, I'm not Bruce Wayne, but I keep the fire like a dragon (Fire)
Stackin' up loose change and I turned this shit into a mansion (Mansion)
Boarding in a new plane, one phone call when we landing (Landing)
Know where the crew came from the northside of the planet (Northside)
She see the new chain, she gon' jump right out of her panties (Jump out, out of her panties)
Before the trap turned golden, I was stacking in the pantry (Stacking the pantry)
Ain't nun Hollywood but the name, I gotta tell 'em that

[Chorus: Quavo]
Don't nothin' change but the chains (Woah)
We on ya head like a bang (Bang)
All double R's, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (Stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (Gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (Ring)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign, foreign)

Foreign exchange the chain (Chains)
Fame came with the change (Fame)
You get a stripe for a stain (Stripe)
You 'bout to crash out your lane (Skrrt)
The umbrella out of the Rolls Royce Cullinan
Know it came with the rain (Cullinan)
No letterman, I've been a veteran
Nigga do anything for a name (Anything)
When you start getting a lil' change, watch how your partners and everything change (Change)
And when you step foot in that field, make sure you're strapped and make sure you got aim (Grah)
My niggas, they shooting to live, I seen some niggas, they shooting for fame (Nah)
They don't know that this shit real, that's how you end up getting blown out 'ya brains (Brrt)
The money, the car, the chains, the fame, I'd give up everything (Why?)
To see my grandma, just to see my kinpica
The drugs inhale all the pain (No cap)
I get you knocked off of Earth, you play with my body, you play with my name (Play with it)
I wet 'em up like he surf, If he looking strange, I pop out his brain (Don't play with me)
I'm rockin' a watch with no diamonds in it, it cost me a ticket, it's plain
I put baguettes in the Patek, what time is it? And it cost me a Rolls, insane (Rolls)
I don't post pics with sticks and shit, that's how them boys get framed (Fool)
I been the same since a jit, lil' bitch, when they see me they say

[Chorus: Quavo & Takeoff]
Don't nothin' change but the chains (Takeoff,  woah)
We on ya head like a bang (Bang)
All double R's, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (Stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (Gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (Ring)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign)
Foreign exchange to change (Foreign, foreign)
