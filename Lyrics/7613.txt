Everytime tha Beat Drop Lyrics[Intro: Buddie & Jermaine Dupri]
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
Uh, uh, haha
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
So-So Def!

[Verse 1: Pimpin']
You know pimpin' make the beat drop, fuckin' with a laptop
I make 'em do it do it, as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out, like Nick, I like to wild out
I'ma stay in the game until I fall out
First, I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it (I pop wit it)
When they bring the mics, the crowd I rock wit it (I rock wit it)
I never hittin' licks, tryna get it quick
When the songs come on they, like that's my shit
[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh (Woo)
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop (Oh)
I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

[Verse 2: Monica]
I know you used to seein' Mo laid back
So for the most part, you think I'm like that (Dig this)
You about to get a glimpse of the fit
I'm givin' niggas on the floor, man
When I hit the door, man
'Cause I ain't one of these too boogie broads
Always in the club holding up the wall (Now dig this)
You about to get a taste of the way
That we do it down here in the A
Let me say

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out, damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh (Ooh), all the ladies in the club grab a dude (Grab a dude)
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

Now I ain't talkin' 'bout a little two step (Whatcha talkin' about?)
I'm talking bout some that'll make you sweat
And when I talk well I'm through talking
I'm about to do some move some let you see somethin'
When I say get gutta, it's enough said
Do the bounce like you over on Bank head
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin' you
Look 'em dead in the face and you say

[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is (Oh), when they play my shh (Oh)
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out, damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

[Verse 4: Jizzal Man]
I trick stats like candles and I blow that money (I blow that money)
I'm drunk off the goose so I throw that money (Throw that money)
I spendin' white T cash, yeah, that throwback money (That throwback money)
When I step off in this spot like I know that's money (I know that's money)
And my chain so styling, how colors diamonds you need, man?
I ball all week; you only ball on the weekends
Damn! And you ain't fresh azimiz
It's DFB, bitch, and I can, I can
[Chorus: Monica & Buddie]
I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh (No)
I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
I love to wild out, damn right, shake it all night, wild out
Hey, that's my jam, every time the beat drop
I said, ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude (Grab 'em, grab 'em)
And you work it real slow, you can do it (Do it)
Move it, 'til you make him lose it
Ro-ro-ro-rock, then bend my knees
Every time the beat drop
He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop
