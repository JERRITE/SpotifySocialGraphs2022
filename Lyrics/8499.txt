Riva (restart the game) - radio edit Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've tasted pain of loosing someone
Who broke her chains
Don't ever look back
At these wasted moments cause
Future ain't what it used to be
She is not to blame
You shook the tree
Feel what should fall
As you could see
Restart the game
You've tasted pain of loosing someone
Who broke her chains
Don't ever look back
At these wasted moments cause
Future ain't what it used to be
She is not to blame
You shook the tree
Feel what should fall
As you could see
Restart the game
[Bridge]
You can't stay for years
Crying all your tears
Move your freaking ass
Forget about the past
You are not out of mind
Down this road you'll find
Answers to your pain
Just walk to make it end

[Verse 2]
You've tasted pain of loosing someone
Who broke her chains
Don't ever look back
At these wasted moments cause
Future ain't what it used to be
She is not to blame
You shook the tree
Feel what should fall
As you could see
Restart the game
You've tasted pain of loosing someone
Who broke her chains
Don't ever look back
At these wasted moments cause
Future ain't what it used to be
She is not to blame
You shook the tree
Feel what should fall
As you could see
