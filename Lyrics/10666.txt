Ooh

[Chorus]
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)

[Verse 1]
Left up the lobby (Just left)
Hit up the party (Hit up the party)
Pull up to find me (Pull up to find me)
They like to call me, Johnny Tsunami
It's hard to stop me (It's hard to stop me)
I keep surviving (I keep surviving)
Just like karate (Let's go)
I'ma kick it to ya like you're right by me (Right by me, yeah)
And it gon' stay like that, never been no rat (No rat)
Had to throw up my trust in the air and it stayin' up there so it can't go splat (Like truck)
And I'm rockin' with a princess barbie doll on me, I don't need no brat (No way)
You can look but don't touch, don't throw it out, won't cap, don't play like that (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go killin' my vibe again (Vibe again)
Told you not to comе to my tribe again (Tribe again)
Why you keep switching environmеnts? (Environments)
We don't wanna start no violence (Violence)
Hope you don't take this personal (Personal)
Bet your own people don't show you love (Love)
They ain't even here to back you up (On no)
How you gon' let 'em gas you up?

[Chorus]
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
How you let 'em gas you up? (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
They had to gas you up (Gas you up)
Boy, you let 'em gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey

I remember when I tried to sell my weed (My weed)
Thinkin' 'bout it make me feel woosy ill (Woosy ill)
Wonder how the haters and the groupies feel (Groupies feel)
Most of my life is a movie reel (Movie reel)
Tryna swing it 'round like a Louisville (Just swing)
Fell in love with the percs and the sleeping pills (The percs)
Had me so high that it went downhill (Let's go)
Let me see it before it start to get worse (Get worse)
Then I started knowin' my worth (My worth)
Wanna see a lil heaven on earth (On earth)
Can I see a lil heaven on earth? (On earth)
Went to church then I got a new birth (New birth)
But they tryna get me to reverse (Reverse)
In the morning, why you thinkin' me first? (Me first)
Man, you really gettin' on my nerves (C'mon)

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go killin' my vibe again (Vibe again)
Told you not to come to my tribe again (Tribe again)
Why you keep switching environments? (Environments)
We don't wanna start no violence (Violence)
Hope you don't take this personal (Personal)
Bet your own people don't show you love (Love)
They ain't even here to back you up (On no)
How you gon' let 'em gas you up?
[Chorus]
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
How you let 'em gas you up? (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
They had to gas you up (Gas you up)
Boy, you let 'em gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey

[Break]
Now, I still ain't changed up by the way
Then I started knowin' my worth
Wanna see a lil heaven on earth
Can I see a lil heaven on earth?
Now forever and ever with me, feel what I'm sayin'?
Wanna see a lil heaven on earth
Light some air right now (Oh)
Eastside forever and ever, you get what I'm sayin'?
Long live Boom, long live Nick, long live Drake
One more time

[Chorus]
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
How you let 'em gas you up? (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
They had to gas you up (Gas you up)
Boy, you let 'em gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
Hey, gas you up (Gas you up)
