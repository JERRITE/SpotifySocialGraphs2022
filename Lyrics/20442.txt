Save Our Souls Lyrics[Chorus: Jake Hill]
Don't put your faith in me 'cause loving me is worthless
Don't try so hard to see the best in me, no purpose
And you can't save me, I'm a goner and it's making me sick
You don't deserve me, you're too perfect to be dealing with this
Just let me go back to my old ways, I'll be okay
I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Josh A]
Been so hard to keep it simple
Always in the middle of things I don't really want to be in
Life for me is sort of sinful, always act on impulse
Became someone I don't want to be now
I could drop ten racks but it wouldn't mean a thing
Make it right back, still gon' end up in a grave
Yeah, she told me she in love, I don't even know her name
I can hit her up but it won't erase the pain, nah
[Pre-Chorus: Josh A]
Don't put your faith in me
I don't wanna see you cry
Why do you wanna save me?
Why do you even try?

[Chorus: Jake Hill]
Don't put your faith in me 'cause loving me is worthless
Don't try so hard to see the best in me, no purpose
And you can't save me, I'm a goner and it's making me sick
You don't deserve me, you're too perfect to be dealing with this
Just let me go back to my old ways, I'll be okay
I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Jake Hill]
Tell me I'm only by myself in the vision I created
Put you to the side, know I hate to see you cry
But I'm running out of time and I know you can't relate
I know I deserve it all, don't wanna be the one you hate
So take my heart and throw it right back
You know I like that
You don't deserve that
These worthless words will bury me six feet under the dirt, nah

[Pre-Chorus: Josh A]
Don't put your faith in me
I don't wanna see you cry
Why do you wanna save me?
Why do you even try?
