Bath Salt Lyrics[Intro: Meechy Darko]
Ah, it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a zombie, hahaha

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
The highest high, I'm Ayatollah
Rubber on my dick, allergic to baby strollers
Blue dream, that amazing odor
Ant is a Pyrex, I'm the coke and the baking soda
Juice be the blue flame that create the whole thing
Rap game, crack game, apparently the same thing
If this was eighty-something, I'd be in shell toes
Gucci-link fat rings, ashy ass elbows
Saving every penny tryna get up out this hellhole
For my super thugs hustling up off the jail phone
Life's a battle, fool, you better have your weapon drawn
How could I be scared of death? Bitch, I'm already gone
Money on my mind, your bitch on my zipper
Breaking up pound after pound, THC on every finger
You gon' need a boost from God to get as high as me, nigga
Excuse me, I meant to say as high as we, nigga
[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Flatbush Zombie, A$AP Mobbing
Hit a killswitch and put an end to any problem
Flatbush Zombie, A$AP Mobbing
Hit a killswitch and put an end to any problem, bitch!

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Hash and weed, hash in a bong
Got weed by the ton, got blow by the load
If you wanna get throwed, A$AP Ant got the po-tion
Three fly ass bitches with weed
Double-cupped them double Ds
Hi-high nigga, hi-high living
Three young ass niggas running shit, no slipping
Gotta know the game, gotta know the lane
Gotta know the pain, no handouts, ain't shit easy
Dark shades, on my Eazy-E
Got bitches on my mini-me
And you niggas in the rap game, can't relate
I'm real pimping, no fornicating
Fuck what you heard, I'm going ape
Smoking Grape Ape, fuck your mixtape
That's a weed plate, Zombie style
A$AP, never mind these clowns
I love brain, Zombie style, never mind these clouds
You might also like[Interlude: A$AP Ant]
Juice, pass me the weed
Meech, where the acid at?
A$AP Ant in this bitch, uh

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
I-I'm a demon, triple-beaming, painting pictures
Raping Mona Lisa, blood sheets, creeping for the panties
With the collar dannys, killing bitches, sniffing panties
Willy Wonka candy semen, three niggas, one bitch, one clip
One brain dead girl off your mind, leave your brains on your moms
Razor blades dipped in bleach, tear your skin to piece
Dump the body in Tennessee, highway getaway
OJ Bronco, cap it, baby
Drive 'em off the bridge, look into my eyes, vivid tears
I see fear, y'all some fucking queers
Grow a fucking pair, I'm 'posed to be here
'Posed to be dead, overdosed on shrooms
Let's cruise, drive by on-site
Ride like a bike, for my Zombie homies kill tonight

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
F-F-F-Flatbush Zombie, A$AP Mobbing
Hit a killswitch and put an end to any problem
Flatbush Zombie, A$AP Mobbing
Hit a killswitch and put an end to any problem, bitch!
[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP niggas, we aliens, cold-blooded nigga, reptilian
A-a-acid, acid, Ambiens, only fuck a bitch if she lesbian
Trill niggas run the city, got the key on lock
Juice got the juice, nigga Meech gon' pop
Addie in the Caddy with the heat on cock
When a Mac go brrat cause the beef don't stop, niggas
My name is that pretty motherfucker
From the land of the lost of the gully and the gutta
See the Breds made a toast for the honey and the butter
Only die for two things, that's my money and my mother, motherfucker
Niggas know my name, did I stutter?
Niggas know me, man, I keep it one hunna
I'm a stunna, Hood by Air for the summer
Toast to the Gods and it cost nine hunna
So-so-so-so ru-run up if you wanna
MAC in the backpack, right by the MacBook
And I rep that Harlem
And my Zombie niggas straight out of Flatbush

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I'm 'bout to get our boost up
They gonna have to pay 900 for our tees Bari
Fuck all that, fuck all that $100 tee, $200 tee shit
Wanna look like me nigga
You gonna have to pay a stack on rack, nigga
Make a bitch catch a heart attack when they see this price tag, nigga
Toast to the Gods nigga, hahahah
I'ma come clean my nigga
I be that pretty motherfucker, hahahah131Embed
