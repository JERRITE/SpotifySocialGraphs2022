How 2 Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
All I ever do with you is fight, fight, fight
That's no way for us to live a life, life, life
Time we realised we're on the same sad side
Tonight I promise we don't start a riot

[Pre-Chorus]
I put away anxiety
I just stopped thinkin' about it
I just stopped thinkin' about it
So come and take a ride with me
There ain't no doubt about it
[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to dance
Dance, dance
Like no one ever taught you how to dance
Dance, dance
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to—

[Verse 2]
Gather up your thoughts and let them go, go, go
You gotta get out and lеt them know, know, know
Leave thе negativity outside stage door
Or you ain't gonna rock and roll no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I put away anxiety
I just stopped thinkin' about it
I just stopped thinkin' about it
So come and take a ride with me
There ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to dance
Dance, dance
Like no one ever taught you how to dance
Dance, oh, dance
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to dance

Just slide, there ain't no doubt about it
I just stopped thinkin' about it
Ah
There ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to dance
Dance, dance
Like no one ever taught you how to dance
Dance, oh, dance
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to dance
Dance, oh, oh
Like no one ever taught you how to dance
Dance, oh, oh
Tonight I'm gonna teach you how to danceEmbed
