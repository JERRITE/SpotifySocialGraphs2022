Sunroof (24kGoldn Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Nicky Youre]
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da

[Chorus: Nicky Youre]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
[Verse 1: Nicky Youre]
You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
You got me dancing in my bed, so let me show it
You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not
Wanna give myself to you

[Pre-Chorus: Nicky Youre]
Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind (You got me stuck on the thought of you)
I'm feeling like this might be my time to shine
With you, with you, with you

[Chorus: Nicky Youre]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favoritе tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on thе thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

[Post-Chorus: Nicky Youre & 24kGoldn]
I got my head out the sunroof
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah-ooh
You got me stuck on the thought of you
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah-ooh (Ayy, ayy)

Top down on the 405
Half hour late, we on L.A. time
Girl, come through if you still outside
You a VIP, you can skip that line
I'm right where you ought to be
Penthouse view, girl, you gots to see
From the 415 to 949
It's a long-ass drive, but I'll give you a ride 'cause we'll
Drop the top in my whip
Sit back and get comfortable
One hand on that wheel
Other hand on my baby boo
Can't believe that I'm here
Ain't it crazy what lovers do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Nicky Youre & 24kGoldn]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

[Post-Chorus: Nicky Youre & 24kGoldn]
I got my head out the sunroof
Oooh-woah, oooh-woah-oooh
You got me stuck on the thought of you
Oooh-woah, oooh-woah-oooh
[Outro: Nicky Youre]
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-la-da-di-daEmbed
