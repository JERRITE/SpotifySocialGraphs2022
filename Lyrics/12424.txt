Breaking Skin Lyrics[Verse 1: Elias Soriano]
I need more than just blood and air to survive
There's a hole so deep and cold
It will never see the light
Of day

[Pre-Chorus 1: Elias Soriano]
Until you feel the skin break

[Chorus 1: Elias Soriano & Rasheed Thomas]
Eyes are always fallin' on you (You)
But that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (Call)
Yeah, eyes are always fallin' on you (You)
And that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (Call)
[Verse 2: Elias Soriano]
I need more than just blood and air to survive
(How can I give you any more when there's nothin' left?)
There's a hole so deep and cold
It will never see the light
(How can I give you anymore when there's nothin'?)
Of day

[Pre-Chorus 2: Elias Soriano]
Until you feel the skin break

[Chorus 2: Elias Soriano & Rasheed Thomas]
Eyes are always fallin' on you (You)
But that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (Call)
Yeah, eyes are always fallin' on you (You)
And that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (Call)

[Bridge: Elias Soriano]
We're weaker than we care to admit
We scratch and itch
We're graveyard shifting
Biting and barking
Fueling and sparking that fire, that itch
And breaking the skin again

[Pre-Chorus 3: Elias Soriano]
Until you feel the skin break (Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes)

Eyes are always fallin' on you (Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes)
But that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (The skin, the skin, the skin)
(The skin) (Keeps callin')
Yeah, eyes are always fallin' on you (Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes, those eyes)
And that itch, it keeps callin', callin' (Again, again, again, again)

[Outro: Elias Soriano]
