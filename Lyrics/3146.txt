Cross My Heart Hope To Die LyricsChorus
Boy you really Trey... u Know u ain’t gone ride (yo let me out)...

You claim u real but That sh** really a disguise

Rip to my Brodie’s in the sky

I live for y’all... I cross my head and hope to die

Yeah I bag up chips not talking Frito-Lays
I keep them sticks if a hater wanna play

Got ni**as invested on me thats inside...

Won't let y’all down I cross my heart and hope to die

Verse 1 (HollyHood)

I ain’t gone play wit u ni**as, I can’t be chasing u h**s

A lot of u ni**as is pu**ies... Let me find out u getting exposed

You ain’t never made no runs ni**a, put money to tha side for my bond ni**a

Bitch I ain’t no dumb ni**a been on my shit since a young ni**a

Evеn when I had a job I always kept some plays

Rеup  first ..hit da road and go shopping in the A

It’s been a good day hope I ain’t gotta catch a case

Either Claiming self defense or like Tk and do da race

It’s like a storm every night... threw the struggle I'm Imma fight
You might also likeThey done gave my ni**a life

That pain a grown man cry...

Chourus
Will he snitch... he bet not... He crossed his heart and hoped to die

Boy u really trey... you know u ain’t gone ride (yo let me out)...

U claim u real but that sh*t really a disguise

Rip to my Brodie’s in the sky

I live for y’all... I cross my head and hope to die

Yeah I bag up chips not talking Frito-Lays

I keep them sticks if a hater wanna play

Got ni**as invested on me thats inside...

Won't let y’all down I cross my heart and hope to die

Verse 2 (Foogiano)

He say he a real one, I know that he lying
All them caps In his rhymes.... yeah I make a quarter mill all the time

Maybe cause I’m so slime... all them youngins round me boy they gone slide

U cross that line and ni**a I’ll take ya pride, like Tony Parker ni**a I keep a nine (Hoe)

And I got the loot, Ima savage ni**a I got the proof

These .223’s they gone knock off yo roof, these .308’s will knock ya ass out ya boots

And I really be cautious.. catch me hanging with bosses

I put u in a coffin, if u try me Hundred thousand I floss it (ice ice ice)

My bitch like me neat..... Hundred thousand on me

I ain’t talking bout my teeth, all these Benjis I can buy u some teeth

Try to cross me ni**a better watch yo feet, go watch them ni**as I’m the wolf they the sheep

Like Kemba ni**a I be walking the beat, he hating but he really want him a feature (Foo)

Chorus
Boy u really Trey... u Konw u ain’t gone ride (yo let me out)...

You claim u real but That sh** really a disguise

I keep them sticks if a hater wanna play

Got ni**as invested on me Thats inside...
