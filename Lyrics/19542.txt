Bye Haters Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my god!
Is that Rez?

[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
These haters think they know me
They lie and say we homies
They always acting like we are friends
But they all look so dumb
They as fake as people come
I'm so sick (Yeah) of playing pretend
(Aye, aye)
[Verse 1: Hi-Rez]
Say bye to my haters
I been on my grind so I'll have to catch you later
Sort of like a skater
I been chasing paper, just got paid, someone tell the waiter
(Aye) That we need another bottle
Every day feel like I hit the lotto
I ain't tripping or stressing about tomorrow
No more worries Hakuna Matato
I'm lion and a king
Got her smiling when I sing I been Fighting for my dreams
Like I'm Tyson in the ring
Hustling tryna get it
I was struggling for a minute
Girl you so fine I should give you a ticket

[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
These haters think they know me
They lie and say we homies
They always acting like we are friends
But they all look so dumb
They as fake as people come
I'm so sick of playing pretend
(Okay)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hey now, you're a rock star
I'm a roll one get blazed
Hey now, I always work hard so I'm going to shine when I get paid
Yeah I made it to the top but I came from the pavement
New whip new chick on the grave shift
And I love to play say my kush outrageous
I'm a get it when I want I ain't waiting
Let the smoke out the window every time I lane switch
Chrome heart bracelet
Got a bad chick and it look like she waste-less
Lot of game dangerous
Smiling in my face when I fall up in the place
You might also like[Chorus: Hi-Rez]
These haters think they know me

[Bridge: Hi-Rez]
You a hater

You a hater, whether rain or shine best believe I'm a still get mine (get mine)
No time for the haters, and that's not gone change, me and you we are not the same
Little homie You a hater no matter what you say, because the haters just still gone hate
