New Beginnings Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Damn you look good tonight)
I needed something
Someone to trust in, yeah
I needed something
To get me through this life
Never saw you coming
And now we're just running, yeah
You make me feel nothing
When we're driving through the night
And I've been looking all around at the places
You and I were seeing so many different faces
We're just cruising right on through this life with a playlist
And everything is right
Never really thought I would make it
Found someone who I don't think I'll ever replace and
I'm emptying my heart, so you can just take it
I'm living my best life
[Chorus]
And I feel so alive
With you by my side
We can make a life
I've got nothing to hide
Driving so fast
Every town passed
Never look back
We're good at that
'Cause I feel so alive
Damn, you look good tonight

[Verse 2]
We're driving through rain
Running through sun
And looking at plains
We're cruising through towns
Moving all around
But you stay the same
We like to run away
We're ditching all our pain and living for today
We're driving so fast
Wanna make it last, we'll do it our way
And I feel good at night
Full moon the only light
You make me feel like
I'm doing alright
I feel good inside
Maybe a little high
You make me feel like
Everything will be alright
You might also like[Chorus]
And I feel so alive
With you by my side
We can make a life
I've got nothing to hide
Driving so fast
Every town passed
Never look back
We're good at that
'Cause I feel so alive
Damn, you look good tonight
And I feel so alive
With you by my side
We can make a life
I've got nothing to hide
Driving so fast
Every town passed
Never look back
We're good at that
'Cause I feel so alive
Damn, you look good tonightEmbed
