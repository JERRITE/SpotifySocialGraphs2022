TranslationsPortuguÃªsIf Only Lyrics[Verse 1]
A million thoughts in my head
Should I let my heart keep listening?
'Cause up 'til now I've walked the line
Nothing lost but something missing

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't decide what's wrong, what's right
Which way should I go?

[Chorus]
If only I knew what my heart was telling me
Don't know what I'm feeling, is this just a dream?
Ah-oh, yeah
If only I could read the signs in front of me
I could find the way to who I'm meant to be
Ah-oh, if only
If only
If only
[Verse 2]
Every step, every word
With every hour I am falling in
To something new, something brave
To someone I, I have never been

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't decide what's wrong, what's right
Which way should I go?

[Chorus]
If only I knew what my heart was telling me
Don't know what I'm feeling, is this just a dream?
Ah-oh, yeah
If only I could read the signs in front of me
I could find the way to who I'm meant to be
Ah-oh, if only
Yeah

[Bridge]
Am I crazy?
Maybe we could happen, yeah
Will you still be with me when the magic's all run out?

[Chorus]
If only I knew what my heart was telling me
Don't know what I'm feeling, is this just a dream?
Ah-oh
If only I could read the signs in front of me
I could find the way to who I'm meant to be
Ah-oh
