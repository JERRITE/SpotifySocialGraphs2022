Summer In the City Lyrics[Intro: Noah]
It's Now United
RedOne
Let's get it started
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Any, Heyoon with Diarra, Any & Heyoon with Diarra, Lamar]
Hey! The city streets are burning up our feet
As we, as we runnin' wild, as we, as we runnin' wild
Hey! Just like the sun, we gonna blaze it up
Cali-California style, Cali-California style (Uh, ha-ha)
[Pre-Chorus: Lamar, Diarra with Lamar, Sabina with Lamar & Heyoon, Sabina & Diarra]
I know you feel it like I feel it, it's the right time
Wavy everywhere we go (Uh)
Out the sunroof we can catch a summer vibe
Here with me, it's always home (Uh)
Turn it up and keep it poppin' for the whole night
Going so hard vertigo
Just let it go and close ya eyes, we be alright
Eh, eh, eh (Yeah, yeah, ha-ha)

[Chorus: Any, Any & Heyoon with Sabina & Diarra, Heyoon & Sabina, Sabina & Lamar with Any, Heyoon & Diarra, (Lamar)]
Summer in the city, we be lookin' pretty
Goin' at it all night
Summer in the city, sing it to me, baby
Du-du-du-du
Summer in the city, we be lookin' pretty
Underneath the sunlight
Tell me what you want (Ah-ah)
I know what you want (Ah-ah)
Summer in the city, we be lookin' pretty
Goin' at it all night
Summer in the city, sing it to me, baby
Du-du-du-du
Summer in the city, we be lookin' pretty
Underneath the sunlight
Tell me what you want (Ah-ah) (Just tell me what you want girl, ha-ha)
I know what you want (Ah-ah) (I know what you want girl)

Promise, promise, don't forget all the, all the shh- we did (Uh, ha-ha)
