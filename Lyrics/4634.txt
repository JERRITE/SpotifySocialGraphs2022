Ayy, can you come to Henry's after you done? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby
Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby
Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby
(That's cool, bitch, you're mine, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Who want a shot, wanna die? (Yeah, yeah)
Lemme know, I got two on the hip and the knot, no diggity
Zay, you smooth like a R&B song
How you keep them hoes off you? Man, they killin' me
Numero uno, might kick shit like judo, judo
Givin' out hoes, not kudos, kudos
Pocket fat like Juno, you know
Yeah, I tell a bitch eat it like Doja Cat (Yeah)
You see the wrist whip it like Bouldercrest (Yeah)
I got a crib bigger than Budapest (Yeah)
And the shots ain't bringin' my soldier back (Yeah)
From the noose to the drop and the wop, no diggity
New to the top and the rock new Tiffany
Zay, you smooth like an R&B song
How you keep them hoes off you? Man, they killin' me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby
Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby
Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby
Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby
Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby
Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

It feel good since a nigga been back
But a nigga done changed, changed, changed, changed, changed
Weed couldn't settle my fire
Couldn't cover my pain, pain, pain, pain, pain (Ah, yeah)
Lane, lane, lane, lane, lane
Swang, swang, swang, swang, swang
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah ye-ah, ye-ah, yeah)
I see God when I be ridin' out
Boy, you always ridin' 'round with a target on
If a nigga follow me to the car garage, I'ma spark it up
That's a Mack with a MAC in a Tonka trunk
Like my uncle son, got some thump in here
Like a trumpet, huh, when it's crunk in here
When it's dump in here? I'ma spark it up (O-O-Okay)

What's on your mind, what's got you fired up? (Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby)
