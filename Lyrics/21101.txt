I Wanna Go Back Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you're sorry
And I promise to try to forgive
Tell me you still want me
And maybe I could be a little less sensitive
[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 2]
If you could acknowledge
That you left me here guarding the door
And hold me like you used to
Then maybe I could feel less insecure

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you did

[Verse 3]
Did you even bother
To understand how I might feel?
How do I make sense of
What feels like we're pretending
And what feels real?

[Chorus]
And I wanna go back to it
I wanna backtrack to it
And if there's a path to it
I'd have to forget what you didYou might also likeEmbed
