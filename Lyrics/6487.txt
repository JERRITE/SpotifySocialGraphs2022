Knock Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta say I changed the game
No one can forget my name
Because I carved it here forever
Steady on the highest stone
Like a king upon his throne
You can all bow down together

[Chorus]
When the world comes knockin'
I knock back
Think you've seen the greatest
I top that
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
When you retreat I'm singing
Can't stop the force I'm bringing
Maybe you should consider this a warning
Wake me up and the storm starts a' coming
If they slow down, I'll go harder
If they're walking, I'll start running
You don't get this crown for nothing
Yeah, it's me this crowd is loving

[Chorus]
When the world comes knockin'
I knock back
Think you've seen the greatest
I top that

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I knock back
I top that

[Outro]
When the world comes knockin'
I knock backYou might also likeEmbed
