Far Away Lyrics[Chorus: Kirk Knight]
I see you peeking from far away
I'll wait another day
Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'
I see you peeking from far away
I'll wait another day
Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Pussy so good, I pay another nigga's child support
So he ain't gotta be around no more
Pussy so good, I pay the mortgage and all her rent
Pussy so good I might just tattoo her name on my dick
Pussy so good, I might just fuck around buy her a ring
No I'm tripping, that's what happens when you gone off a tab
Some LSD, some S-E-X
My tongue on the mouth, my hand on the breast
Don't try to kiss me after head, I'm a man of respect
It's like you got a gold mine in between those legs
You ever had a gold smile, nigga give you head
Lick, lick, lick
She said me next
[Pre-Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Headed to the mental ward
When I say I'm gon' give it to her
Shorty cake just like a Cinnabon
Taste a piece, soak me up
Fuck her good, love or lust
Hit you later, see what's up
We could get it in

[Chorus: Kirk Knight]
I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
'Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'
I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Shawty fire, fuck around and let her live in my crib
I call her ex, tell him this is my bitch
Word to Kirk, yo it is what it is
Tat her name on my wrist
If I slice 'em, we both gonna die from this, uh
I'm suicidal when I'm not in your presence
You know you want it even more when it's not your possession
Time is of the essence
Give me some time
Make a little investment
Know you feel a little neglected

I need a bitch with elegance
A bitch with etiquette
A ride or die bitch
The one who I can get cheddar with
Is you down for whatever, would you hold a Beretta?
If it came down to some fed shit, would you tell em?
Look, time gon tell, but you might as well, uh
Heavenly sent, yeah, you fine as hell
Love the way she looking in that new Chanel
I might give her ten thousand to do her nails

[Pre-Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Headed to the mental ward
When I say I'm gon' give it to her
Shorty cake just like a Cinnabon
Taste a piece, soak me up
Fuck her good, love or lust
Hit you later, see what's up
We could get it in

[Chorus: Kirk Knight]
I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
'Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'
I see you geekin' from far away
I'll wait another day
Cause all them secrets you revealing
Nowadays got me fiendin'2Embed
