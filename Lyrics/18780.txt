In This River Lyrics[Verse 1: Zakk Wylde]
I've been around this world, yet I see no end
All shall fade to black again and again
This storm that's broken me, my only friend

[Chorus]
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
[Verse 2]
Withdrawn a step away just to find myself
The door is closed again, the only one left
This storm that's broken me, my only friend

[Chorus]
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming backYou might also like1Embed
