ReGeneration LyricsNo more bias, no more basic appliers
No more liars, no more normal, no more hiding outliers
No more, don't want guiders who be following trends
No more, power to folks, more common than Lonnie Lynn
Dime a dozen u are, u ain't stuntin, ya chain is all bloody
U pushed my queen to collagen, u want em all ugly
U want em all with the fattest ass & a small tummy
You want it all right, fuck peace, if War's money

Nah, shimmy shimmy ya'll, there's many very poor
With no pennies at all starving while we building plenty malls
Is THIS ...
Ever getting solved,  .. never nah
Until we can sever ties and build a mosque right next to a synagogue
Until then let's just head to mars, and go off ...
And I ain't coming back until the whole hood's whippin a Tesla car
Yes ...


Will I pull my gun or pull my dick out
Tune in live you kids don't wanna miss out

I tell em man don't want war, nah
Call off ya dogs, tell the Sarg don't get involved, i bark the orders, boi
Who the fuck wants what, do the math, and when it sums up
Now whats up, I don't just shine, i'm why the suns up


That explains why I don't crave for that light
Maybe I know the answer, & just afraid to be right
Maybe i am the cancer, & I'm taking the lives
Instead of saving em, & I do harm with my radiant vibes, wait

Maybe this light I shed ain't safe for no one, stay clear
Go on, move along, u don't know what's at stake here
I don't say prayers, i use my pre frontal cortex
& use thought, but that ain't helping my poor rep


Maybe i should change genders like Cait Jenner
And be the first chick with a dick rappin, I'm all set
Take a pic with some tits & my genitals & get more press
Now I’m famous huh... Mr/Mrs  Whorebless, (HELLO)
You might also likeYeh the newer testament's been spoken
I'll address this for the culture
Take this message and decode it, hold up

Be attentive, armageddons getting closer
Ain't no presidents to vote for
That could get us out this hole, that's been dug



U feeling hope, then u bugged, or sniffing coke in a club
Tryin'a be part of that scene, snortin that wur wur wur ...
Most of these folks are just lonely, decaying, opiates
Killing em slowly, 2 pills away from an OD

U want the lights and the glitz, the hype & the hits
The life of the rich, well, u might end up like Michael or Prince
That's the price for that shit, so why exist in a mindless trip
Where you'll get ...  sucked in by more filler than Kylie Lip's
Don't mind me SHIT, cause I'll be lit, with 90's kids
In a Partynextdoor with Kyrie's chick
96, million, IG clicks, later
Some slimy prick, will probly slide in and sign me quick



Really?...  it's all connected, it's all connected
This shit’s depressing, all these lames I ain't try to be friends with
Don't it start & end with talent, the way that you get in?

Hell no ..  look around this is all connected

Even lupe got a cosign from Ye
Ye got cosigned by Jay
Hov cosigned J Cole
Who cosigned Kendrick  who later got cosigned by Dre
Before that well ...
He also got a cosign from Drake

We all know Drake got cosigned by Wayne
Who cosigned Nicki, Minaj,  50 cent cosigned Game
Em cosigned fif, look who cosigned them
Its Dre again,  ..... is u linking the chain of events

Is this even making some sense, what u need to get rich
Ladies hit iggy azalea and ask for  a Tip
Lately this shit’s in hysteria, pass me a spliff
And i don't even smoke, it'll relax me a bit

I might dabble a bit, and dab with the kids
Fuck it, i might not, i might pass & just plan out a trip
Defy my doctor, find a shaman, take ayahuasca, find a mantra
That tries
To dichotomize ... divide & conquer


Oh ... u don't like me, cause you ain't like me
But we ain't gotta be shaped with the same psyche
I grind like slaves that make Nike's
I relate
Cause I can't even come close to pay for what's made by me
I got my bae by me, she ain't got a Kim K body
But she got the brains of a Twain & Gandhi
She reads, she ain't on the gram stunting like a skeeze
Baby girl's like what some of u should be

Fuck it now i'm free
And u don't like it, nah, i get it now
U don't like that i don't let u down, or ever sweat ya crown
U want me on that wall, u need me on that wall
I know u wanna Pimp C me, try and lean me on that wall

Godspeed,  you hope Bun B see's this as a diss
It’s that deep, u want me sleeping with the fish
Want me bleeding til I'm stiff
Wish i was ceasing to exist, a myth, peeking thru a glitch
Stripped, deep in the abyss
There's a reason this is dense
Before I leave this I'll cement
My name, & leave it with a dent
None can fix so be content
Fuck this shit, let's be direct
Ya all puppets, ya all dumbin it down
I'm numb to it here
I baked  humble pie, start shoving it down
Yum
Eat it now ... & stop with the crying
I'm not to be tried, like Pac when he popped them cops with a 9
I got this
So ahead of my time while jotting this rhyme
I checked the response of this song, and read comments online
I got this
God's artist, got my chakras aligned

A faraday cage, blockin their shock doctrine design
I got this
I fuckin love this and thats all that matters here
I quit, coveting dumb shit, now this substance has appeared


If i'm up there to my peers, that's a plus but I don't care
I'm just trying to find a balance like slug of atmosphere
Adjusting, you can't imagine how much fun we're having here
Watch out, smart went crazy, little man, say hey there

To the angel face, with evil eyes, they try to demonize
Read the fine ... print you'll see that the limit's been redefined
I'm winning, the hope & fire, stoked inside this
Could get Kobe, so inspired that he won't retire
Note this, writers, i open minds up
Don't quote, just ponder
I've closed in, show me the golden rhymers
It goes Lamar, Em, Ye, Hova, Nas, And maybe Cole ...
And i just snuck in that picture like a PhotobomberEmbed
