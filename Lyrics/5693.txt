Drop of Smoke Lyrics[Chorus: Hudson Taylor]
Get me out of this room now
Get me out of this world
A drop of smoke is too much now
A plume of rain is a curse
I'd never move to the city
I'd never move to the past no
I'd never call something pretty
'Cause looks they don't always last

And I'd kill to get away
I'll die to make my own way
And I'd lose to celebrate
I'll win to see the good days
And I'll never stop the fighting
So bring to me your worst
I'll never stop believing
That I could rule the world one day
Whoever knocks on my window
Whoever is ruining my hope
I wouldn't laugh in achievement
Like what I dream is a joke
And I'd kill to get away
I'll die to make my own way
And I'd lose to celebrate
I'll win to see the good days
And I'll never stop the fighting
So bring to me your worst
I'll never stop believing
That I could rule the world one day
One day

Gone, gone you're going gone
Down, down you're going down
Gone, gone you're going gone away
Gone, gone you're going gone
Down, down you're going down
Gone, gone you're going gone away
Gone, gone you're going gone
Down, down you're going down
Gone, gone you're going gone away
Gone, gone you're going gone
Down, down you're going down
Gone, gone you're going gone away
You might also likeAnd I'll never stop the fighting
So bring to me your worst
I'll never stop believing
That I could rule the world one day
And I'll never stop the fighting
So bring to me your worst
I'll never stop believing
That I could rule the world one dayEmbed
