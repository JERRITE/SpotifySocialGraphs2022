Wondrous Place Lyrics[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
I found a place full of charms
A magic world in my baby's arms
Her soft embrace like satin and lace
A wondrous place

[Verse 2: Miles Kane]
What a spot in a storm
To cuddle up and stay nice and warm
Away from harm in my baby's arms
A wondrous place
[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
Man, I'm nowhere
When I'm anywhere else
But I don't care
Everything's right when she holds me tight

[Chorus: Miles Kane]
Her tender hands on my face
I'm in heaven in her embrace
I wanna stay and never go away
A wondrous place

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
Man, I'm nowhere
When I'm anywhere else
But I don't care
Everything's right when she holds me tight

[Chorus: Miles Kane]
Her tender hands on my face
I'm in heaven in her embrace
I wanna stay and never go away
A wondrous place

[Outro: Miles Kane]
A wondrous place
