Lover Undiscovered LyricsShe wakes up a lover undiscovered
Brightens up the grey skies today
Look at her, how could I forgive her
For making me give myself away

And when she comes to me
It's like a song on the sea of time

She calls out my name, it echoes in the light
Chasing away the shadows of the night
And when she's gone, there will never be another
Lover undiscovered
The time has come for me to tell her story
Of how her sweet love dances all around
She's laughing, tells me not to worry
If the darkness falls upon this house

And when her head hangs down
It's like the Sun touching the tides

She calls out my name, it echoes in the light
Chasing away the shadows of the night
And when she's gone, there will never be another
Lover undiscovered

And when October comes
She paints the Moon on a paper sky

She calls out my name, it echoes in the light
Chasing away the shadows of the night
And when she's gone, there will never be another
Lover undiscovered
Lover undiscovered
