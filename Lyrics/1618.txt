Only Us Lyrics[Intro: Ryan Trey]
Baby
Wanna know

[Chorus: Ryan Trey]
Wanna know somethin', baby? Ayy, yeah
I think I really love you
I've been tryna throw somethin', baby
Nah, girl, I'm really tryna fuck you
It's only us in this bitch (Only us)
Only us in this bitch (Only us)
But girl, it's only us in this bitch
Only us, in this
[Verse 1: Ryan Trey]
Thousand dollars tennis shoes, cop whatever just for you
You want me now, I want you too, I put that on my soul
Treat you like that Bentley coupe, where you at? I'll fly to you
I'll make sure it's just me and you, I'll never let you go
Thousand dollars on these jeans, you could take it all from me
You throw it back unconsciously, I feel it my bones
All these hoes gon' fall in line, I'ma give you all of mine
Let's make some time, don't waste no timе, I'll never let you go
Pop it, baby, pop it feel on top whеn I be underneath
We been stayin' lowkey, but they know just what you done to me
Every time I slide, I don't do twos, I gotta shoot the three
We don't fight, but I'll go Cassius Clay, you get in me in the sheets
Even when I touchdown, I land and call your phone
Tell your girls you're busy, I'm right here up the road
Babe, you know I'm certified, this money ain't a joke
You say I ain't dropped my hoes, I never said I won't

[Chorus: Ryan Trey]
Wanna know somethin', baby? Ayy, yeah
I think I really love you
I've been tryna throw somethin', baby
Nah, girl, I'm really tryna fuck you
It's only us in this bitch
Only us in this bitch (Only us)
But girl, it's only us in this bitch
Only us, in this

When we out it's only us, treat me like your OnlyFans
Watch you like my favorite show, poppin' like some rubberbands
That nigga that you entertainin', nah, he ain't seein' me
Bet you run laps through the mall, get you C and C
Strippers at the B&B, say she from the DMV
I come from the gated capitol, my name big as Meech
On this trail by the beach, offshore Audemars
Jewelry in the Cullinan, now you dancin' with the stars
Tell me that you moving 'round a lot, I shouldn't take it far
Rebellious type of nigga, never listen, know I'm breakin' laws
Breakin' hearts, big money, quick to break you off
You got haters on you, baby, need to shake 'em off
Love the thong, but take 'em off
Whole meal, I'ma eat her up
We go out, you bring a friend
We in a two-seater stuffed
You been workin' hard, need to live, come see what it is
Just pick up the phone when I call, tell me how you feel

[Bridge: Ryan Trey]
And I know you outside
And I know she lowkey wild, dawg
I'm on the fence, you know me, baby
'Cause it's always like the time's off, off
Baby, take these clothes off, ah-off
Wish I'd turned the time off, what's going on?
Think I wanna know more 'bout you, baby, uh
[Chorus: Ryan Trey]
Wanna know somethin', baby? Ayy, yeah
I think I really love you
I've been tryna throw somethin', baby
Nah, girl, I'm really tryna fuck you
It's only us in this bitch
Only us in this bitch (Only us)
But girl, it's only us in this bitch
Only us, in this

[Bridge: Ryan Trey]
And I know you outside
And I know she lowkey wild, dawg
I'm on the fence, you know me, baby
'Cause it's always like the time's off, off
Baby, take these clothes off, ah-off
Wish I'd turned the time off, what's going on?
Think I wanna know more 'bout you, baby, uhEmbed
