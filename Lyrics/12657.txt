Joyriding Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not sure what they said
But if it's true I'll bet
Just one more thing I'll regret
I hate my weaknesses
They made me who I am

[Chorus]
"Yeah, it's cool, I'll be okay"
I felt your pain wash over me
Dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Hate the look that's on your face
[Verse 2]
These things inside my head
They never make much sense
I wouldn't hold my breath
I hope I die before they save my soul

[Chorus]
"Yeah, it's cool, I'll be okay"
I felt your pain wash over me
Dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Hate the look that's on your face

[Bridge]
Don't hang up
'Cause I don't have anyone left here
Don't give up
Don't hang on to anything I've said
I hate my weaknesses
They made me who I am
It makes no difference
I'm insignificant

[Chorus]
"Yeah, it's cool, I'll be okay"
I felt your pain wash over me
Dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Hate the look that's on your face
You might also like"Yeah, it's cool, I'll be okay"
I felt your pain wash over me
Dry your eyes and hide my shakes
Hate the look that's on your face

[Outro]
