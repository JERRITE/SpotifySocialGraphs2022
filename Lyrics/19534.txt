OH IS THAT RIGHT? Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, ayy
I run this shit, ayy, yeah

[Chorus]
She said she do what she like
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Three on me just for the night
This is a game
I win everything, look at the lane
Swerving ahead of you tryna stay sane
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I keep on bagging, I'm bragging but broke
I'ma go rap about shit that I know
So I'm telling y'all why the fuck I been low, yeah
My ex and I don't get along, and that's crazy
'Cause we made a baby, it's so complicated
'Cause we both know no one on Earth here can change me
Used to pray, but that felt forced, so I quit doin' it
My parents religious, and I am a hooligan, ayy
Running around like I run the game
Out of thе country, assume
That I'm with some company, too, this is the movе, yeah
Feelings accustomed to women like you
I've been to Paris, so pass me the doobie
I'm up in France, but I swear it's the moon, yeah
I'm bumpin' Cudi in Cleveland, it's true
If I say somethin' is happening watch it come through
The light in the view, ayy

[Chorus]
She said she do what she like
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Three on me just for the night
This is a game
I win everything, look at the lane
Swerving ahead of you tryna stay sane, ayy
She said she do what she like
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right? Yeah
Three on me just for the night
This is a game
I win everything, look at the lane
Swerving ahead of you tryna stay sane, ayy

Bitch, I'm delusion, been here but new to you, ayy
Tell me what losing is, look like you know it well, yeah
I'm in the mountains just making a classic
It is so random, but lyrics attract
And I swear it ain't me, but it happens, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She said she do what she like
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right?
Oh is that right? Yeah
Three on me just for the night
This is a game
I win everything, look at the lane
Swerving ahead of you tryna stay sane, ayy

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm delusion, been here but new to you, ayy
Tell me what losing is, look like you know it well, yeah
I'm in the mountains just making a classic
It is so random, but lyrics attract
And I swear it ain't me, but it happens, yeah, yeahEmbed
