The Love I Give Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know sometimes
Sometimes we cry
I think about love in a lot of ways
And if it didn't hurt, would it feel the same?
Oh, what a life
What a beautiful life it is
I'm trying to keep hold of the love you gave
And give a little back in a better way

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see blue skies
The colours look amazing
Reminds me of the day we met
You know I'd never change it
Never change it
[Chorus]
No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I live, I live for you
No, leavе you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The lovе I give, I give to you

[Verse 2]
Darling, there's a dark side to every street
Sometimes in the strangers that we meet
I gotta keep a hold of the love you gave
And give a little back in a better way

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see blue skies
The colours look amazing
Reminds me of the day we met
You know I'd never change it
Never change it

[Chorus]
No leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I live, I live for you
No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I give, I give to you
