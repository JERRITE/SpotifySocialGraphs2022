​don’t worry, you will Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can make you happy for a while
Smile for a little
Pretending like my heart ain't broke
You think I'm charming for a minute
Funny for a second
Until I turn into a joke

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to stay positive
Not an easy way to live
Step inside of my brain
We can take it nice and slow
At the pace you wanna go
Laugh right through the pain
[Chorus]
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
"I don't wanna find a reason to doubt you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
I'm a freak, I'm a fraud
I'm a child, I'm flawed
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"

[Verse 2]
Oh, you say you really love me
Right up until you leave
There's nothing I can do to help
The conversation will get ugly
A dream into a chore
You'll say you need to find yourself

[Refrain]
Trying to stay positive
Not an easy way to live
Laugh right through the pain

[Chorus]
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
"I don't wanna find a reason to doubt you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
I'm a freak, I'm a fraud
I'm a child, I'm flawed
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
You might also like[Chorus]
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
"I don't wanna find a reason to doubt you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"
I'm a freak, I'm a fraud
I'm a child, I'm flawed
She said, "I can't find a thing I don't like about you"
And I'm like, "don't worry, you will"4Embed
