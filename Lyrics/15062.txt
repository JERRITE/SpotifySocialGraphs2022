Rape This Day Lyrics[Pre-Verse 1]
You're the only one I ever told
That I will rape this day
Got a barking dog
And a smile to tell
And I will hate this day
Sporting the name brands
Clothes make the man
And I will rape this day
Guess a heart won't break
That ain't pumping Kool-aid
[Verse 1]
I got a fighting chance
You know you promised me the last dance
A micro naught in time
This fat 24 is all mine
Nothing but moans and blood
And so my blood counts my loss
You cannot eat just one
A diaphragm revelation
Just want to get some disease
And get your stamping heart the hell outta here

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
Rape this day

[Pre-Verse 2]
This is the real mouth
Sew it up and fly south
And I will rape this day
I'll blow with you on the ground
Or leave it 'til the leaves turn brown

[Verse 2]
And I will pinch and tear
And pull and kick you right there
I'll proud and jerk and stretch
Into a pretty bruise, a cat scratch
You might also likePut a rake on your neck
But who would cry or complain?
Compared to the pain
Of your sorry white vein

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this dayEmbed
