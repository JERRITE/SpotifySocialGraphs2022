Made in Hell LyricsFrom memories of '68 when "The Wizard" shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the Midlands sound unfurled
The Bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to feel

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But over time it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
In Henry's and in Mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word

I took the scream around the world, from London to L.A
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo, blew Godzilla away
Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy 'cause they never get their fill

Of hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal Gods will return

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's Route 666

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hellYou might also likeEmbed
