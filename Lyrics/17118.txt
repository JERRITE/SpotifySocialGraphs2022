Easter Egg Hunt Lyrics[Intro]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith
Back on that bullshit, you know what I'm saying?
Ha-ha
Motherfucking block party, nigga
It's Hood (Pablo Juan)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I be fresh like I jumped out the grave (I jumped out the)
My bitch bad, she don't know how to behave
My VVS diamonds, they looking like glaze (Ice, ice)
Got chains on my neck, so they think I'm a slave (They think I'm a slave)
My bitch be killing these niggas like AIDS
I stay on the paper route, go and get paid
I'm rolling with honor like I got good grades (Yeah)
Can't fuck on that pussy unless she shaved
Huh, trap nigga got me some racks, now what? (Now what?)
Slapping that ass from the back when I fuck
Swerving the foreign, I need some good luck (Skrrt)
My niggas, they banging, they throw that shit up (Throw that shit up)
Trap that shit out, call the plug and re-up (Trap it out)
Still fuck twelve, we gon' do what we want (Fuck twelve)
Lift up her legs when I hit from the front (Lift 'em up)
Put 'em in the dirt like Easter egg hunt (Boom, boom)
[Verse]
Stepping on niggas, Eastside stomp (Stepper, ha)
Candler Road, nigga, that where I'm from (Candler road)
Bitch, I be rocking that Yves Saint Laurent (Bitch, Saint Laurent)
Plug in the valley got all kind of Runtz (Runtz)
Bitch so bad, I don't know what she want (What you want?)
Fresher than nigga that dressed up for prom (Ha)
Three different bitches, fuck them one at a time
VVS diamonds, I put them in prong
Say you want beef, we won't do it over song
I knock 'em out the park, I'm getting 'em gone
I'm geeked on the Perc', I fuck too long
The work all white but the Rolly two-tone
Like a porcupine with the Louboutins on
Why you do 'em like that? I'm deadass wrong
No hair dryer, her head got blown
Gotta look up to me, I'm flyer than drone

[Chorus]
I be fresh like I jumped out the grave (I jumped out the)
My bitch bad, she don't know how to behave
My VVS diamonds, they looking like glaze (Ice, ice)
Got chains on my neck, so they think I'm a slave (They think I'm a slave)
My bitch be killing these niggas like AIDS
I stay on the paper route, go and get paid
I'm rolling with honor like I got good grades (Yeah)
Can't fuck on that pussy unless she shaved
Huh, trap nigga got me some racks, now what? (Now what?)
Slapping that ass from the back when I fuck
Swerving the foreign, I need some good luck (Skrrt)
My niggas, they banging, they throw that shit up (Throw that shit up)
Trap that shit out, call the plug and re-up (Trap it out)
Still fuck twelve, we gon' do what we want (Fuck twelve)
Lift up her legs when I hit from the front (Lift 'em up)
Put 'em in the dirt like Easter egg hunt (Boom)You might also likeEmbed
