​huge mood Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you say nothing's wrong
But when I see your back
Don't need the clothes off
To read your pain
You tend not to notice
What I'm trying to convey
I don't like the know-it-all appearance
Sorry, coming through
Not here to interfere
I'm here to be your man
Someone who understands
Yeah, we all need time to be alone
But not until we get cray-yeah-yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Jaded, I feel so damn jaded when I'm with you
I feel my heart beating harder when I'm next to you
My love, my love
Please don't wrestle the pain
My love, my love
Get ahold of your mind
My love, my love, my love, my love
Take my hand and hold your freedom

[Chorus]
You can be whatever you wanna be
You got the world in your hands
Girl, I'm your number one fan
You know I'll never leave
When will you believe in me? (Oh, oh)
We don't have to be sacred
There's no need to be savin'
All we got is love, got is love, God is love
Babe, we don't have to be sacred
There's no need to be savin'
All we got is love, got is love, God is love, ooh

[Bridge]
When you feel like you're in the right place
Will you finally see?
There's not a thing to be afraid of
My love, oh-ooh, my love, oh-ooh
Take my hand and hold your freedom
You might also like[Chorus]
You can be whatever you wanna be (You wanna be)
You got the world in your hands
Girl, I'm your number one fan
You know I'll never leave
When will you believe in me? (Oh, oh)
We don't have to be sacred
There's no need to be savin'
All we got is love, got is love, God is love
Babe, we don't have to be sacred
There's no need to be savin'
All we got is love, got is love, God is love

[Outro]
Ooh, all we got is love (Ooh)1Embed
