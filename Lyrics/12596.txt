Mr. Radioactive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's so obvious that we don't make a lot of sense, no
You're a star and I'm a mess who can't wake up without his Xanax
Sleeping on my stomach, tryna calm my spins
Got drunk off broken promises
So I took the day off and called in sick
I'm contagious, so

[Chorus]
Back away from the asshole
Ejected from magic castle
I don't know why, I don't know when
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Back away from the asshole
Before we lose half Manhattan
I don't know why, I don't know when
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
[Verse 2]
Go ahead, strap the saddle on
I'm down to ride off into the sunset
Up the cameras and catch me
While I'm cornered like an animal, so

[Chorus]
Back away from the asshole
Ejected from magic castle
I don't know why, I don't know when
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Mr. Radioactive strikes again

[Bridge]
If you give me what I want, nobody gets hurt
Don't try to get smart, you'll make things worse
When dealing with desperate men
There's only one option

[Chorus]
Back away from the asshole
Ejected from magic castle
I don't know why, I don't know when
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Back away from the asshole
Before we lose half Manhattan
I don't know why, I don't know when
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Mr. Radioactive strikes again
Mr. Radioactive strikes againYou might also likeEmbed
