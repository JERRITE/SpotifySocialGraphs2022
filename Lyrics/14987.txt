Spinning in Daffodils Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once, out in the rain
I was able to strangle my shadow
Then shackle the chain (Chain)

[Verse 2]
What?
What will you do?
Is it safe to play God in the garden and king of the zoo? (Zoo)

[Verse 3]
Holes
Well they need to be filled
Positions available
Yet some are quite hard to get out of, or in (In)
[Chorus]
Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

[Instrumental Solo]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

[Verse 4]
Cold
Alone and alive
You're afraid but that's not what I asked
Wanna go for a ride?
Sharpen your teeth my darlings
Sharpen your minds
Take a finger if the hand feeds you
Shit, take one scalp at a time (Get 'em, or else)
Oh, yeah-yeah

[Verse 5]
Fail, as big as the whale
Like a canine that chases the bone
That's tied to it's tail
You might also like[Verse 6]
I wish I was a beautiful balloon
I could rise up above it all
And fade out of view (Fade)
Gracefully fade, fade out of view
What have you turned me into?

[Chorus]
Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

[Instrumental Solo]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

[Verse 7]
What have you gone and done, my love?
Incinerated in the morning sun

[Instrumental Solo]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
[Beat Switch]

[Instrumental Solo]

[Bridge]
I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
Yeah-yeah
