Qatar Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ay, ay
Yeah

[Verse]
They don't understand my lingo
I done got chips linke Bingo
They thought I would drop a single
Or just another pop jingle
It's Big Chiddy, nigga, get with me
Once I get on these beats I might just get swizzy
$1,300 but each leg cost $650
You gon' need a mop, dawg, my shit drippy
Might pour up a little [?] to get trippy
They jump ship but learn how to stay afloat quickly
If you talking money, then get with me
She try to fuck for position but it gets tricky
I can't let a bitch trick me
Walked in at 6:00, I made a hit by 6:50
"How much you spent on that watch?" That's a quick 50
Peanut butter seeds, I call that whip Jiffy
It's [?]
Cars drive theyselves, now thеy shit is autonomous
Had a few scares like thе last time that Canibus
In this hotel for a week and it's kinda plush, your time is up
Just know the plan is smart
I could talk a good game, nigga, Shannon Sharpe
They tell lies to cover it up, I'm not a fan of talk
Deep water, to know me is to understand a shark
I'm a dog, I just bite, I don't plan to bark
I came up, remember watching 106 & Park
Now I'm a rockstar, I could pick guitars
They can see me from afar, I'm a distant star
And for the World Cup I might just hit Qatar
[?], how did I get this far?
[?] picked me up, he told me, "Pick a car"
He just pull strings like he flick guitarsYou might also likeEmbed
