New Classic (Live) Lyrics*Crowd cheering*

[Verse 1: Joey]
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
That you're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes
It's the way you make me feel
There's finally something real
Words are hard to find
But I'm gon' get it right this time
Just come and take my hand
Take away my fear, make me strong enough
So can I dance with you?
It's how I speak the truth
It's just classic when we met
Now you made me new
[Spoken: Joey, Dominique, Mary]
All right guys, hold on a minute. I want this to be perfect. It's not gonna be perfect until I have someone special standing here right next to me
*Crowd cheering*
Mary you out there?
Mary, did he say Mary?
Yeah, yeah that's what I'm talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Mary Santiago. Ooo, I guess I better get out of your way
Alright let's see, was it a little boy band move like this?
Ooo, okay, uh, that was cute. What was it?
Oh, that was you
*Crowd ohhhs*
Uh, that's not really how it goes. You need some help with that move?
Like you could've done it any better?
*Crowd ohhhs*
Sweetheart, I invented that move
*Crowd cheers*
Prove it, let's see you keep it real
Thank you, oh I'm keeping it real
*Music begins to play*
You remember this?
*Mary laughs*

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Joey, with Mary]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young, taking on the world
From the driver's seat
(Spoken)
Come on, I can't do this without you
(Sung)
You look so classic, fantastic
When you own that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

Trying to do it right and no rehearsal is your life
And you're doing this crazy dance
Cause you're making these crazy plans
Trust this is not a test
You put in work to do your best
It's a classic take on a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They'll know your name

[Chorus: Joey, Mary, Both]
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young, and trying everything
Just to touch your dreams
From the driver's seat
You're the new classic
Fantastic
Now you own the floor
Bring the beat back once more
And let me see you do that
You're the new classic, you're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young, you take the chance to believe in me
You're the new classic, fantastic
Now you own this floor
Bring the beat back once more
And watch us while we do thatEmbed
