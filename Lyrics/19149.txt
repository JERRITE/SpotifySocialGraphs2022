Rich Boy, I don't know what these niggas think

Coming down like snow in the wintertime
I don't know about you, but I'm getting mine
D-I-P, never cold, nigga, hell yeah
Zone 4, gon' pull up in the ATL
Getting money, already know what it is
Huh, don't stop, bitch, what the business is
Get more ass than a La-Z-Boy sofa
Keep my toaster warm in my holster
See, you got your lil' jewelry, but I'm chunked out
All that hating, playboy, get you stomped out

[Verse 2]
Nah, I don't wear tight shirts with the cufflinks
See them big VS stones, make your eyes blink
Say I talk slow and I rhyme funny
But I ain't thinking 'bout nothing but the big money
Big cake, big shrimp on a big plate
Nigga so iced out like a snowflake
Don't hate, big crib with the big lake
Say she wanna taste some of that milkshake
Put your money where your ass at and run that
Just getting started, nigga, we done done that
What you know about them folks that was shooting it off?
While y'all was lying, running, and moving your mouth
Homeboy, we ain't going for the okie-doke
'Cause we-a pop it off quick with the gunsmoke
See what I tote? Keep it in my lap
If these hollow points hit you, nigga, it's a wrap
