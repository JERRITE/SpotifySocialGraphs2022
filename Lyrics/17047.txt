Genius UK Biweekly Update #3 LyricsüìÖ Date: April 1 - April 15:

Hey all! It's April Fools, and I have absolutely no prank to play on anyone, but that doesn't stop me from dropping this update. Music's been coming like Pompey fans towards Wembley Stadium to watch the Checkatrade Trophy final (go watch the highlights), so let's get into it!NewsThis isn't necessarily related to UK music, but I have to say this - RIP Nipsey Hussle. On top of being a great rapper, he was also generally just a good person, and he was taken way too soon. RIP a legend.

Moving on from that slightly saddening subject to something different, Hertfordshire rock band The Zombies have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, 25 years after their debut release! Their journey began in April 1961 when the original five met up in a pub to go and rehearse. Now their name is among some of the most influential rockers in the world, like Elvis Presley, James Brown and Fats Domino, to name a few.

Meanwhile, Little Simz, who dropped her Album of the Year contender GREY Area earlier this year, is coming for the throne, as she said to BBC Music:I'm not gonna lie, I'm really happy it's been getting all the love it GREY Area has [...] I feel like my talent has been suppressed in some sort of way. I've got all these odds against me, but when it comes down to it, I am actually very good at what I do.
