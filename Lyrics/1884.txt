Mad at Me. Lyrics[Intro]
What's up? How you feelin' 'bout it?
What's up? Got some shade about it
What's up? You mad about it
Can't be mad at me

[Verse 1]
You know the problem is you seemin' too invested in it
You gettin' hung up, what's up? Why you questionin' it?
You lookin' like this talkin' turnin' you on
Way I'm fuckin' you up, like you love it
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm up on my Aries tip, bet you heard something 'bout it
Fire pit, you keep dancin' around me
So legit, put a copy right on it
You're lost without it, I don't doubt it

[Chorus]
I've been on my hot shit lately, can't be mad at me
You been on some fuck shit lately, keep that distance, please
Yeah, so if you're thinkin' there's a problem, we can settle it
Say you don't care, but truth is you just can't get with it
I've been on my hot shit lately, can't be mad at me

[Verse 2]
Used to be so down, down, down, down, down
Hard to get through you, but let me have a go at it
You out here lookin' like you can't get enough
Way I'm fuckin' you up, like you want it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm up on my Aries tip, bet you heard something 'bout it
Fire pit, you keep dancin' around me
So legit, put a copy right on it
You're lost without it, I don't doubt it

[Chorus]
I've been on my hot shit lately, can't be mad at me (Mmm, ah)
You been on some fuck shit lately, keep that distance, please
Yeah, so if you thinking there's a problem, we can settle it
Say you don't care, but truth is you just can't get with it
I've been on my hot shit lately, can't be mad at me (Oh, mad)
