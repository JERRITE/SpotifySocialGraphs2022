Heaven For Thugs (Letter to Wap) Lyrics[Intro: Plies & NoCap]
Wish I could bring my nigga back for one day
Take him by the daycare to see his son play
And go to show him how his baby mama done went a stray (Ayy)
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away (I'm just— I'm just thinkin' 'bout my nigga Wap, man)
Wish I could bring my nigga back for one day (Like, like, like)
Take him by the daycare to see his son play (Two, three weeks ago I had a show in Mississippi)
And go to show him how his baby mama done went a stray (And after the show)
And how the fuck niggas claimed they loved him walked away (I ended up bumpin' back to him at the gas station and shit)
God give me my nigga for twenty-four hours (And I ain't Goddamn—)
So we can ride and laugh at these pussy ass cowards (I ain't have no drink, and I had to hit the road)
Hit the liquor store, park, and just talk for hours (And, this bitch had like a linе of cloaks on though)
Show him half the niggas die when thеy lose they power
It was his last line of cloaks, he thought it was from 'ak
I had to tell that bitch I used to think that shit was there too
That nigga— That nigga gave me that last line, long gone
Yeah, yeah
Fuck all that shit, but, he just a nigga who gon' give you his last anyway
You know what I'm sayin'? Like—
[Chorus]
(Say I wonder)
If it's a Heaven for thugs? And I wonder
If it's a Heaven for thugs? And I wonder
Is it a Heaven for thugs?
And I wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?
And, wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?
And I wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?

[Post-Chorus]
Damn, Wap, why you did that to me?
You did the same thing Lil E did to me (My nigga, my hustler)
Damn, Wap, why you did that to me?
You did the same thing Lil E did to me (My thug, brother)

[Verse 1]
I take off these Cuban links, and throw 'em in the ocean
'Cause these diamonds don't mean nothin' when pain floatin'
Don't tell Fred about them shootouts when he ask how it's goin'
Even though my days still rough, and my tears still blood
Would've thought we did it all, but it feel like all ain't enough (My brother, my thug, my brother)

[Bridge]
No more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more
I guess that I won't see you, no more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

We always said before them niggas take us, we'll let the drugs do it (We always said that nigga, I swear to God)
We always said before them niggas take us, we'll let the judge do it
I told the kids I graduated since they say I'm a influence (You know the courts be tryna paint a bad picture of a nigga, and shit)
Mind takin' trips that I'm not plannin'
My nigga, what about Miami?
You left yo' nigga out here stranded
You left yo' brother out here stranded
Right beside your face, them candles lit
Tryna get comfortable with feelin' like this
I'm askin' questions, like, "Do happiness exist?" (You don't know what you did to us dog, I promise you)
Oh, oh-oh
Askin' questions, like, "Do happiness exist?" (We got kids out here, they got a mama, she just lost her child, nigga)
Remember we slept in the same cell together, yeah
Remember we used to dodge 12 together, yeah
Say what they want, you steppin' on whatever, yeah
Temporary livin', and we die forever, yeah
Die forever, we gon' die forever
We gon' die forever, we gon' die forever
We gon' die forever, we gon' die forever (You know niggas can say what they wanna say, nigga, know Wap standed on business, nigga)
I'm out here, I'm holdin' my heat, while you protectin' the Jeep
That Lambo' you passenger seat, you vent how you happy for me
I pulled fifty racks out on you, you pulled thirty racks out on me
And then, we hit the mall, you would try to pay for everything
To get you back, pay everything (Fuck this money, nigga)
Come roll with me one more time (Fu-, Fuck this fame, nigga)
Come roll with me one more (I want my nigga back, fuck these platinum plaques, nigga)
Come roll with me one more time (Come roll with me)
Come roll with me one more
And, I heard that the good die young
Well, I don't see me gettin' old
I heard that the good die young
Well, I don't see me gettin' old
I heard that the good die young
Well, I don't see me gettin' old
(I heard all birds fly home, just another empty soul)
Look at your daughter, I see you, I know them kids miss you
Told you keep yo' gun, Didn't know it'd be the pills to kill you
These past dreams been so real, like I can still feel you
"Ayy, Cap, I'm with you, bitch, I'm ridin'," I can still hear you
"How the fuck the game gon' get fly without you? Nigga," I can still hear you
"Shit ain't gon' add up no more," I can still hear you
"Remember them long nights on that block, thug," I can still hear you
How you leave this world without us?
[Chorus]
(Say I wonder)
If it's a Heaven for thugs? And I wonder
If it's a Heaven for thugs? And I wonder
Is it a Heaven for thugs?
And I wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?
And, wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?
And I wonder, is it a Heaven for thugs?

[Post-Chorus]
Damn, Wap, why you did that to me?
You did the same thing Lil E did to me (My nigga, my hustler)
Damn, Wap, why you did that to me?
You did the same thing Lil E did to me (My thug, brother)Embed
