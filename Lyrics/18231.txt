Little Saint Nick Lyrics[Intro: Joshua Bassett & Matt Cornett, Matt Cornett]
Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Matt Cornett]
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' on his sled
[Chorus: Matt Cornett, Joshua Bassett]
It's the little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)

[Verse 2: Joshua Bassett]
Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four-speed stick
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

[Chorus: Joshua Bassett, Matt Cornett]
It's thе little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)
It's thе little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)

[Bridge: Both]
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

[Verse 3: Matt Cornett, Joshua Bassett]
And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise
You might also like[Chorus: Joshua Bassett, Matt Cornett]
It's the little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (The little Saint Nick)

[Outro: Joshua Bassett & Matt Cornett, Matt Cornett]
Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint NickEmbed
