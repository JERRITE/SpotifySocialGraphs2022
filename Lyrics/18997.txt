Hammerhead Lyrics[Intro]
Ow

[Verse 1]
I am the one, camouflage and guns
Risk my life to keep my people from harm
Authority vested in me
I sacrifice with my brothers in arms

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
Come on, do it, here we go!
[Chorus 1]
(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Stay the course, reasonable force
I believe I serve a greater good
Smoke and dust, enemies are crushed
Nothing left where a man once stood

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
But, I'm just doing what I'm told

[Chorus 2]
(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it begins and where it'll end, nobody knows

[Bridge]
Hey, go!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
In my head, in my head

[Verse 3]
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil for thou art with me
Locked and loaded, gonna find my truth
Now, I'm busting through, all hell breaks loose, and-a
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can all hide behind your desks now
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can cry, "Teacher, come help me!"
(Woo-hoo!) Through you all, my aim is true
My

[Outro]
(Woo-hoo!)
(Woo-hoo!) My aim is true
(Woo-hoo!)
My aim is true2Embed
