Born to Perish Lyrics[Verse 1]
We are natural born sinners, our life is full of temptation
We suppress our evil instincts with divine education

[Pre-Chorus]
Phantoms and ghosts
Are our declared lords, gods and hosts
Creatures of fable
Can't manipulate the mortality table

[Chorus]
Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy
[Verse 2]
Supreme leaders and demigods
Our divine beings in control
Wield our agenda to oppress our rise
To avoid their downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
Phantoms and ghosts
Are our declared lords, gods and hosts
Creatures of fable
Can't manipulate the mortality table

[Chorus]
Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy

[Bridge]
We live in diversity and in doubt
No matter how obscure, day in and day out
We act against our common senses
We need to break down all those fences
In this twisted world of fake leaders
We face too many inhuman breeders
The own mind is a gift against all odds
Provoke the twilight of the gods

Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish
We suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish
We deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish
We are all going to hell
Born to perish
Or purgatory

[Outro]
Born to perish
Born to perish
Born to perishEmbed
