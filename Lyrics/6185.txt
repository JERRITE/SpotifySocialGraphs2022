TranslationsEnglishFran√ßaisDeath of Me Lyrics[Intro]
This love, this love
This love, this love
This love, this

[Verse 1]
This love looks like a loaded gun
A noose around my neck or a sweet poison
If it gets in the wrong hands, then we're fucked
'Cause heaven knows what you do to me
You could chain me up or set me free
And you could suffocate or let me breathe, yeah
Baby, you could be the death of me
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be, you could be
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be the death of me
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me

[Verse 2]
One man's hell is another's God
It's all about perspective, a parallax
You're a cold-blooded killer only after dark
But I don't mind (Woo)
'Cause I'm a sucker, I'll do 'bout anything
Just to get those hands on me, yeah
Keep me hanging on so desperately
Baby, you could be the death of me

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be, you could be
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be the death of me
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me

Let you chain me up or set me free
You could suffocate or let me breathe, babe
You could be the death of me (Woo)
Heaven knows what you do to me, yeah
Let you chain me up or set me free (Woo)
You could suffocate or let me breathe, babe
You could be the death of me

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be the death of me
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me
Maybe I'm crazy, I know you're danger
Baby, you could be the death of me
I'm falling, fading, and seeing angels
Baby, you could be the death of me6Embed
