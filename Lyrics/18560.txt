Best I Never Had (EP Version) LyricsI knew you once, you never knew me then
Afraid to ever say, I wanted to be friends
And now the years have passed, you're far away
And suddenly I feel I'm not the same

The walls are breaking down
I think I'm crackin' up, I look around
Now everything's too much

And the world is spinnin' much too fast
Well, I can hardly catch my breath
And I just hope that this will last
The world is slippin' from my grasp
I'm looking 'round to find the girl I left behind
You were the best I never had

Remember when I saw you in the hall
You passed right by my stare, not noticing at all
If I'd had the guts, I'd catch your glance
But I am just the boy without a chance

The walls are breaking down
I think I'm crackin' up, I look around
Now everything's too much

And the world is spinnin' much too fast
Well, I can hardly catch my breath
And I just hope that this will last

The world is slippin' from my grasp
I'm looking 'round to find, the girl I left behind
You were the best I never had
You're the best I never had

And the world is spinnin' much too fast
Well, I can hardly catch my breath
And I just hope that this will last
You might also likeThe world is slippin' from my grasp
I'm looking 'round to find, the girl I left behind
You were the best I never had
You're the best I never had

You're the best I never had
I'm looking 'round to find, the girl I left behind
You were the best I never hadEmbed
