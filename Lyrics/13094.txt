​this is heaven & id die for it LyricsPretty boys, yeah they’re up to no good
Test it out, it’s well understood
Beneath the palms when the lights start to leave
You started laughing when you looked at me

“art is dead” read the personal ad
Keep getting stoned & you’ll never be sad
Looking for coke in a state of bliss
This is heaven & i’d die for it

Slumped down, he’s down for the count
Drunk kids fucking in the backseats of cars
You started sobbing on the way to the bar
Slumped down with your head on your knees
Look in the mirror at you looking at me

So test me out, see what love really means
I heard you’re vicious but you heard i’m a freak
The body aches when you tell it to quit
But this is heaven & i’d die for it

Slumped down, he’s down for the count

(i think it used to bring me down
But now i’m laughing out loud)You might also like2Embed
