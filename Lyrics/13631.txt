How You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody's perfect, I'll never try (No)
But I promise I'm worth it if you just open up your eyes (Eyes)
I don't need a second chance
I need a friend
Someone who's gon' stand by me right there till the end
If you want the best of my heart, you've just gotta see the good in me

[Chorus]
'Cause I could be the rain in your desert sky
I could be the fire in your darkest night
I could be your curse or your angel
It's all in how you love me
I could be your sun when it's cold outside
I could be your rock when there's nowhere to hide
I could be your curse or your angel
It's all in how you love me
It's how you love me
[Verse 2]
You get what you give, that's the simple truth
So, just lend me your hand and I'll give you someone to hold onto
I don't need a second chance
I need a friend
Someone who's gon' stand by me right there till the end
If you want the best of my heart, you've just gotta see the good in me

[Chorus]
'Cause I could be the rain in your desert sky
I could be the fire in your darkest night
I could be your curse or your angel
It's all in how you love me
I could be your sun when it's cold outside
I could be your rock when there's nowhere to hide
I could be your curse or your angel
It's all in how you love me
It's how you love me
It's how you love me
It's how you love me

[Outro]
Oh, you know I could be the rain in your desert sky
I could be the fire in your darkest night
I could be your curse or your angel
It's all in how you love me
It's all in how you love meYou might also like2Embed
