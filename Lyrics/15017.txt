Take Me Back Then LyricsNothing's wrong
I'm just wastin'
All the time that I've tasted
Take me back on a time trip
Won't you take me
Just take me, take me back then

Won't you take me back, then
Won't you take me back, then
Why don't you take me
Nothing's wrong
I'm just wastin'
All the time that I've tasted
Take me back on a time trip
Won't you take me
Just take me, take me back then

Won't you take me back, then
Won't you take me back, then
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me

Nothing's wrong
I'm just wasted
I'm the one who's tastin'
All the time that I'm faced with
Won't you take me
Just take me, take me back then

Won't you take me back, then
Won't you take me back, then
Won't you take me back, then
Won't you take me back, then

Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
