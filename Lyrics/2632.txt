TranslationsPortuguÃªsTold You So Lyrics[Verse 1]
For all I know
The best is over and the worst is yet to come
Is it enough
To keep on hopin' when the rest have given up?

[Pre-Chorus]
And they go

[Chorus]
"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me so
"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me
[Post-Chorus]
Say, they say they told me
Say, they say they told me
Well, you say, you say you told me

[Verse 2]
I know you like
When I admit that I was wrong and you were right
At least I try
To keep my cool when I am thrown into a fire

[Pre-Chorus]
And they go

[Chorus]
"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me so
"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me

[Post-Chorus]
Say, they say they told me
Say, they say they told me
Well, you say, you say you told me

[Bridge]
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me so
"I hate to say 'I told you so'"
But they love to say they told me

[Post-Chorus]
(Throw me into the fire, throw me in)
Say, they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire, throw me in)
Say, they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire, throw me in)
Well, you say, you say you told me
(Say they told me, say they told me)
