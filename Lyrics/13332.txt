Mr. Badman Lyrics[Chorus]
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
I'm the king and the queen and I don't quit
Turn to fool if you coming in a big whip
Got the cuties in the coup and we do not slip
Believe me, we not talk without a reason
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown

[Verse]
Never go down for nothing
I'm taking the crown and running
I got the clout, you bluffing
Yeah, I got the clout, you looking
When I drop a bar, you buzzing
Got you feelin' just like you cumming
I selling that shit, you crushin'
I'm packin' the heat, you crying
Homie, you don't know me, glow it, glow it
But I been 'round
If you don't wanna kamikaze
Come and show me how you bend down (Oh, oh)
[Refrain]
And we be sitting in the two seat
Got the lights, engine running
Ooh, baby, you like that
Psycho girl got you gunning
If I'm gon' do that
I'ma do like it's nothing
I don't see no custom
Then you start but they comin'

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't want it, no, I don't want it, I don't want it
Now if you want it, I'll let you touch it, oh, you crushin'
Homie, you don't know me, glow it, glow it
But I been 'round
I know you want it

[Chorus]
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
I'm the king and the queen and I don't quit
Turn to fool if you coming in a big whip
Got the cuties in the coup and we do not slip
Believe me, mi nah big talk without a reason
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown
Ayy, Mr. Badman, gimme that crown (Oh, oh)
You might also like[Refrain]
And we be sitting in the two seat
Got the lights, engine running
Ooh, baby, you like that
Psycho girl got you gunning
If I'm gon' do that
I'ma do like it's nothing
I don't see no custom
Then you start but they comin'

Father, please, forgive me for my pride
Mercy, Mother Mary when we ride
