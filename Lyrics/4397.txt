PYS Lyrics[Intro]
(You goin' with me, Freddie)

[Chorus]
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes (Light up, nigga)
Ride clean, smoke your dope (Light up, nigga)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues (Light up, nigga)
Evidence that I'm chargin' hoes (Light up, bitch)
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes (You already know this)
Ride clean, smoke your dope
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
My pretty boy smile don't joke
[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch
Pretty boy smile, nigga breakin' your ho
Pretty boy smile, teeth white like the blow
Presidential wrist, Whitе House full of dope
Freddiе jumpin' off, I got the dog for the low
Freddie jumpin' off, I got the norf for the low
Smokin' the informant, he involved with the po'
Nigga, ten toes down, never call on the flow
Let them other niggas cap while we gon' ball on the low
Pimpin' your slut, shoot in them guts
Shoot on her face, she gon' lick that shit up
Dipped in gold, back on them Vogues
Want a shot of dick? Then I'm chargin', ho
ATF and DEA I'm dodgin', ho
Still get my Frito Lay regardless ho
Caught up with the work, I ain't call that ho
Lawyer told me they ain't have enough to charge that ho
Pimpin' your slut, that pussy bussin'
Workin' for daddy, two bricks in her luggage
Coke in the carry-on, back in '06
She was whippin' for new Apple Bottoms and Dereon
Mama said, "Don't sell no crack on the telephone"
Tell the police I'm never home
'Cause a nigga dipped in gold, back on them Vogues
Want a shot of dick? Then I'm chargin', ho

Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope (What you mean?)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
Evidence that I'm chargin' hoes (Light up, nigga)
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes (Light up, nigga)
Ride clean, smoke your dope (Light up, bitch)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues

DJ Paul, bitch

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Whippin' in an all-black Cadillac
Pills up, hoes down, nigga, four flats
Tryna get money out of me? Fuck that
I'm on the same shit, I'm tryna put you on a track
Hard out here for a pimp? No mo'
Will I ever be broke again? Nigga, that's a "No" (No)
Watch that syrup pour in slow-mo
But my drug of choice is that goddamn blow
I'm a pimp, I'm a mack, lookin' for the dollas
Need Trues and Vogues help me pull these models
Had her snatched by the kit, washin' the Impala
Kept a TEC-9, kept Tony in the dolla
Memphis Ten' nigga, mane, we been on some pimp shit
Been on some robbin', been with the bullshit
Come around here with the goods, we gon' pull shit
Nigga stay strapped, gotta keep me a tool kit
[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Keepin' me a tool kit, a full clip
Gary nigga, we be with the bullshit (Yeah)
P. Diddy with the brick, I remix
Insane rabbit gang and Three 6 (Yeah)
Get my ho to set him up, a free brick
Told a nigga never trust a freak bitch
I'ma break her off because I keep these bitches off my nuts
It only take a couple bucks to put you niggas in the dust
And I'ma pimp your slut

[Chorus]
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope (What you mean?)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
Evidence that I'm chargin' hoes (Light up, nigga)
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes (Light up, nigga)
Ride clean, smoke your dope (Light up, bitch)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
My pretty boy smile don't—
Bitch
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
Evidence that I'm chargin' hoes (Hell, man)
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope (Hahaha)
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
My pretty boy smile don't joke (Freddie)2Embed
