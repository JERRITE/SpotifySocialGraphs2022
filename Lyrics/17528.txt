Perfection LyricsOli eh oh
Oli eh oh
Hana dul
Jie guem nal bwa
Nae ga mal ha jana
Set net
Yeogri ro wa
Na wa chum chu ja
Take a look at me
Flawless is me
I'm more than just, pretty

Let's do this trick
I'm in the mix
On top of the matrix

Everything is mine
Everything I buy
Is forever mine
Is forever mine
I hear plastic is fantastic
I am fierce cause, I'm plastic
I am perfection in every single day (Wonjean)
I am perfection in each and every way (Wonjean)
I am perfection no matter what they say (Wonjean)
I am perfection, yeah, I am perfection

Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
I am perfection yeah, I am perfection

Nu ga al at get nee
Ne inseng ee lul jul
Nu ga al at get nee
Nae ga star dell gee
Those who did me wrong
They leaching at my skin

World be ready for
The Queen

Everything is mine
Everything I buy
Is forever mine
Is forever mine

Who wants to live forever?
I want to live for fame and fortune
Be the online, Mona-Lisa
Pure like the air, crystal clear

I am perfection in every single day (Wonjean)
I am perfection in each and every way (Wonjean)
I am perfection no matter what they say (Wonjean)
I am perfection, yeah, I am perfection
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
I am perfection yeah, I am perfection

Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection (I am perfection)
Pa pa perfection (I am perfection)
Pa pa perfection, pa pa perfection
