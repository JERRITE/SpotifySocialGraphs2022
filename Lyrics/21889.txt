Let Me Be The One Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody told me you were leaving, I didn't know
Somebody told me you're unhappy, but it doesn't show
Somebody told me that you don't want me no more, no
So your walkin' out the door
Nobody told me you've been crying every night
Nobody told me you were dying
But didn't want to fight
Nobody told me that you fell out of love for me
So I'm setting you free
[Chorus]
Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses
We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you, I love you one last time
And goodbye

[Verse 2]
Somebody told me you still love me, I don't know why
Nobody told me that you only, needed time to fly
Somebody told me that you want to come back
When our love is real again

[Chorus]
Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses
We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you, I love you one last time
And goodbye
You might also like[Bridge]
Just turn around and walk away
We don't have to live like this no, no
But if you love me still then stay
Don't keep me waiting for that final kiss
We could work together through this test
Or we could work through it apart
I just need to get this of my chest
That you will always have my heart
Let me be the one

[Chorus]
Let me be the one to break it up
So you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find a set up where
Someone wins and someone loses
We just have to say our love was true
But has now become a lie
So I'm tellin' you, I love you one last time
And goodbye

[Outro]
Let me be the one, ohh, ooh, ooh-ooh1Embed
