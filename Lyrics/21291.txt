Back And Forth Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now you've slipped away
And found a place to stay
Who do I congratulate?
But I'm happy for you
Where are you today?
I sense that you're afraid
And I don't know what to do

I miss you, but what does it change?
This confusion feels the same
Forget you and let you leave?
But I'm still thinkin' it through
It's been the conflict between us
That's kept me from sinking before
[Pre-Chorus]
You drove me crazy and I let you
Come do it some more
Put the past to bed, we've done it before

[Chorus]
Now we're back and forth again
Can we help this pointless thing?
Swinging like a hinge
To the place we always meet

[Verse 2]
There's nothing to say
Except, "loneliness is strange"
'Cause you wear the face
That I never can leave
And I know you're gonna call
'Cause you know just where I'll be
Once you come and find me here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be happy for me
So happy to be
Not alone anymore
We've done it before
You might also like[Chorus]
Now we're back and forth again
Can we help this pointless thing?
Swinging like a hinge
To the place we always meet

[Bridge]
It's such a shame how little things
Can change your mind
Don't just sit there filing your nails
And passing the time
I can't let you bottle it up
And take it too far
Carrying all of that weight is the hardest part

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Now we're back and forth again
Can we help this pointless thing?
Swinging like a hinge
To the place we always meet
Back and forth again
Back and forth again
Back and forth again
Back and forth againEmbed
