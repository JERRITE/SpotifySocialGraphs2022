Me & U (Bad Boy Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Diddy, Cassie]
Uh
Now y'all know we had to do a remix, right
Report to the dance floor, this is the remix
NextSelection
Hey yo, Ryan you a fool for this one man
I know y'all feel it's gettin' hot out there
Bad Boy
Next Selection, Bad Boy is the empire

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Been a minute, back up in it
'Bout to lean on it, the thuggin' they love it
When I do my thing on it, the ring leader
The head, heart's, whatchu' want
These dude's couldn't save half of what I flaunt
I'm a terror, N-Y forever, been around the world
I'm New York where ever, I shut it down
Like the gate's was closed, he's the who's-who's
Of what he on, now he know, 'Iller to Illinois
The Bad Boys, keep a couple of toys
And I'm back to Phil'A-Roy, so much swag
He's a style aroma's, the game of pick-up
Whatever I'm done with
Step ahead and I'm sittin' on paper
I'm old dude, with street cred' of a gangsta
So how you want it, you could get it, 'cause I got it
I ride around, with your life in my pocket
(Cassie, talk to em!)

[Verse 2: Cassie & Diddy]
You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call (This is the remix)
I know that I shouldn't have had you waiting at all
(This is the remix, her name is Cassie)
I've been so busy, but I've been thinking 'bout
What I wanna doâ€“
(Ay, yo yo, take it back to the top, take it back from the top right now
Ayo, Cassie start all over)

[*DJ Scratching*]

You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't have had you waiting at all
I've been so busy, but I've been thinking 'bout
What I wanna do with you

[Pre-Chorus: Cassie]
I know them other guys, they been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do

[Verse 4: Yung Joc]
(Cassie, let me talk to you for a second baby)
Lil mama, when you do it, you do it so well
If you kiss, promise I won't tell
When you make daddy wanna rock your bell
Turn off the lights, let my ship set sail
Yell my name, we can take it to the floor
Like to explore, baby go and let it go
The best you ever had, yeah I already know
So tell them other suckers, "Baby go and hit the door"
And you know I'm for game, baby I been there done that
Young J-O-C, yeah he's that one cat
Let's go and grind, and he make that money stack
Play by play baby just like it runnin' back
Take three call baby come go, with me
We can vacate somewhere, overseas
Just me and you, yeah it's how it's supposed to be
Kick ya' shoes off, baby keep close to me

[Bridge: Cassie & Diddy]
(Ayo Cassie, take it to the bridge)
Baby I'll love you all the way down, uh (This is the remix)
Get you right where you like it, I promise you'll like it, I swear!
Just relax and let me make (Yeah) that move (It's our secret babe)
We'll keep it between me and you (As we proceed)

[Chorus: Cassie & Diddy]
It's me and you, now (Oh yeah yeah!)
