​all my ghosts Lyrics[Intro]
(The fuck?)

[Refrain]
You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

[Verse 1]
We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night
[Chorus]
All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridin’ shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm
Mmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

[Chorus]
Oh, all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh, did you stand there while wе were takin’ shots of brandy?
They know all of my habits, but thеy don't know about you
I hope that's true

[Bridge]
I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
When all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear
You might also like[Refrain]
You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

[Chorus]
And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watchin' as I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I hope that's true

[Outro]
(Fuck yeah, hahahaha, fuck yeah, hahahaha)Embed
