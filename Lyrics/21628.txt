Arms of a Woman Lyrics[Chorus]
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
Most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
But when she wakes me
She takes me back home

[Verse]
Now, most days
I spend like a child
Who's afraid of ghosts in the night
I know there ain't nothing out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights
[Chorus]
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
Most of my days a I spend alone
A thousand miles
The place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me back home

[Verse]
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me back home

[Chorus]
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
Most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me
Yeah, when she wakes me
She takes me back home
When she wakes me
She takes me back homeYou might also likeEmbed
