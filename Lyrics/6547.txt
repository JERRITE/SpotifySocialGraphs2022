Can’t Take Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, you think you're smart
You try to tear me apart
While you hide in the dark
Hate on me all that you want

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, you think you're cool
Calling everyone fools
Oh, the joke's on you
But you don't even have a clue
[Pre-Chorus]
So tie me in a noose
You know I like the abuse

[Chorus]
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now
Can't take me down, can't take me down
You know they love mе now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now
Call me pеtty, call me vicious
I don't give a shit
So you've had your fun
Now to hell with it
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, you think you're God
You're just another fraud
So what? I have my flaws
I won, so you take a loss

[Verse 4]
Oh, to hell with you
And all the shit you spew
Hope you enjoy the view
Honey, you're already screwed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So tie me in a noose
You know I like the abuse

[Chorus]
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now
Can't take me down, can't take me down
You know they love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now
Call me petty, call me vicious
I don't give a shit
So you've had your fun
Now to hell with it
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now

[Bridge]
You think you know me, but you don't know me
You think you own me, enjoy your misery
You think you know me, but you don't know me
Enjoy your misery

[Chorus]
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now, yeah
Can't take me down, can't take me down
You know they love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing now
Call me petty, call me vicious
I don't give a shit
So you've had your fun
Now to hell with it
Can't take me down, can't take me down
'Cause they all love me now
Yeah, guess who's laughing nowEmbed
