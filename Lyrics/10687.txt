They Not Ready Lyrics[Intro]
Hit-Boy

[Chorus]
They not ready
They not
No, I do not think the masses are ready
Dreez, boy, shit, it's massive already (Uh-huh)
Bentley parked right in the front, you can't miss me (You can't)
Only 'cause I grabbed the Bentley keys accidentally (Oops)
Not only did she run it up, she ran it up quickly
I think it's time to put these wack bitches out their misery (They did)
[Verse 1]
B-I-G D-R-E-E-Z
They been sleep, night quill, Z-Z-Z (Woo)
Top down on sunset, blowing AC, me and HB (Skrrt)
Y'all talk that small talk, you small ball we major league (Bitch, I'm ballin'), yeah
They know not to play with me
Face on Maybelline but in the booth it end fatally
And my accountant just sent the ''Okay'' to me
I give a fuck what you say to me
Ball hard, we play for keeps
You got a group of yes-men, can't be the G.O.A.T. paying for sheep
I'm a legend, throw me all my flowers like a newlywed (Uh-huh)
Try to keep it humble, I like being boujee better (Facts)
Fans waiting to see my show like we just dropped a movie trailer (Christ)
Know I was notorious when we was rocking Coogi sweaters (Big Driz)
Drop at least a hunnid virgils when I walk in Vuitton (A check)
Walk in Magic with a blunt so long it look like a wand
I got so many presidents I could make Joe Biden resign
God took his time, when he made me, I'm a custom design (Perfect)

[Chorus]
They not ready (Nah)
They not
No, I do not think the masses are ready (They not)
Dreez, boy, shit, it's massive already (Big Driz)
Bentley parked right in the front, you can't miss me (Uh-huh)
Only 'cause I grabbed the Bentley keys accidentally (Skrrt, skrrt)
Not only did she run it up, she ran it up quickly (Run it up)
I think it's time to put these wack bitches out their misery (Out, they miss me)

That's shots fired, no Glock .9 (It's my time)
Female rapper, I'm top five and I'm not five (who want smoke)
Rapper's ain't showing no numbers like a blocked line (What the fuck)
Treat the game just like it's my nigga, that mean the top mine (It's mine, nigga)
I'm a walking move, boy, a trendsetter
On hoes' necks' like benchpressing
These bitches cap like big letters (Big), who
Face and bars are ten or better
My shoe size only thirty-nine but niggas know I'm a big stepper (I'm stepping on shit)
Guess my lil five seconds of fame, gon' last forever (Ha)
Triple-six, clean bitch confidence, and plus I'm clever (I'll make)
I'll make it rain so hard Rihanna can't even bring you an umbrella
Even if I gave the cheat code bitches wouldn't be on my level (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
They not ready
They not
No, I do not think the masses are ready
Dreez, boy, shit, it's massive already
Bentley parked right in the front, you can't miss me
Only 'cause I grabbed the Bentley keys accidentally
Not only did she run it up, she ran it up quickly
I think it's time to these wack bitches out their misery1Embed
