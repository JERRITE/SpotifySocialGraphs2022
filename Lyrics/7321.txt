Best Friend’s Ass Lyrics[Intro]
That bouncer was so hot
But, honestly, that's not an excuse to be fucking rude
Literally
"What promoter are you with?"
As if I even need a fucking promoter to get into this club
No, like, literally, you don't deserve that
Ugh, why isn't my phone charging? Do you need to pee?
Yeah, I have to pee
Alright, let's go
[Verse 1]
Walk in VIP, don't need no drink tickets, buddy
I got money, milk and honey
All my bitches actin' funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, uh, they poppin' bottles like, uh
They on my body like, uh
They got the tab and they call me bad

[Chorus]
But all I see is fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass

[Post-Chorus]
Fu-fu–

Fu-fu-fuckboys
Fucking rude

Emptyin' they pockets like it's gonna make moves
They say, "Ooh, I like your shoes
Oh you fuck with Jimmy Choo?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, they poppin' bottles like, uh
They on my body like, uh
They got the tab and they call me bad

[Chorus]
But all I see is fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's (Ass)

[Post-Chorus]

[Interlude]
Should I have another one?
Yeah, you deserve it
We woke up, like, before noon every day this week
#girlsonthegrind
Ugh, I love you, do you wanna leave?
There's another party on the west side
Yaaaas!
Is anyone in there?
Alright, let's go

[Verse 3]
Lights on, gotta leave here now
They're clearin' out the room
I don't care, let's get some food
Fuck that, we're goin' to the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Like, uh, we poppin', sippin' like, uh
And now we trippin' like fuck
I feel super, call a Uber

[Chorus 2]
But it turns out he's a fuckboy
So I told him step up on the gas
'Cause I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's ass
Fu-fu-fuckboys everywhere tryna make a pass
But I can't stop lookin' at my best friend's (Ass)

[Outro]
Fu-fu–
Should I go home with the broker dude or the chef guy?
The chef
Ty Dolla makes me kinda horny
No, do the chef
He just followed me on Instagram, that's kinda cute
Aw, you think he'll make you breakfast?
Delete that off of your story, you can see me in the background
No, no, you look so cute
What are you looking at?3Embed
