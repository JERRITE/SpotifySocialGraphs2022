Law of Attraction Lyrics[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm
(JAE5)

[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
You keep talkin', I've been silent
Now, what's the point of words when you can't read between
The lines you crossed, I'm sick of fightin', yeah
You keep trying, that don't mean a thing
[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
And now I don't mind sayin' how I feel or I think about you
And I don't mind sayin' how I feel, I'm good without you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra & Dave]
But you could have been all that I want, that I need (Could have been)
All (Yeah-yeah) that I want (Yeah-yeah), that I need (Could have been)
We could have been, we could have been
We could have been (Look)

[Verse 2: Dave]
I don't want no distractions
I'ma speak with my actions, check this
I put your name on a necklace
That's a chain reaction
Don't judge me for adaptin'
She studyin' law of attraction
Doin' her own taxes
Too complex for a caption
It's better I hurt you than somebody else, fuck with me
I put you in a truck with me, you're stuck with me
Can't take back all the shit that you've done with me
You're gonna break a bone, you fall out of love with me (Man)
I need a bulletproof vest
For all of the shots that you're drinking for me
Answer the phone, make it simple for me
Girl, I know that you're thinkin' of me, D

And now I don't mind sayin' how I feel or how I think about you
And I don't mind sayin' how I feel, I'm good without you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
But you could have been all that I want, that I need (Could have been)
All (Yeah-yeah) that I want (Yeah-yeah) that I need (Could have been)
We could have been, we could have been
We could have been

[Verse 3: Dave]
Yeah, when I met you, I found afinity
So I won't stop 'til you found stability
Santan, banking's our ability
But I'm still learning accountability
I'd rather lie with you than lie to you
X5, got a sex drive, I drive to you
Wanna go central? Cool
Don't know what to pick, I'll decide for you
And put a Louis bag on the side for you, rich love
She a wicked woman, I need witch love
Dress up, go out, take pics, love
Don't wanna talk over a text
I could see how you're over your ex
Could that be me? Pray I never find out
"Sorry" don't slap the same second time 'round
I ain't perfect but I'll say that I'm real
If it's real, say how you feel
[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
We could have been
We could have been
We could have been1Embed
