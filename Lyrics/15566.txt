Itâ€™s Just Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
It used to be fun
It used to be cool
The cameras were life
And the soundtrack was me and you
I built me a castle on an anchor of sand
I once made an angel and held it by the hand

[Pre-Chorus]
And my life's been a party
But when the party's over
There's nothin' left but the mess now
[Chorus]
It's just me
Standin' alone in this flashy town
It's just me
Hatin' myself, wishin' that someone would stick around
In this melancholy life

[Verse 2]
I listen to these songs
They remind me of the good times
They remind me of the [?]
We used to laugh together
It was fun to have a dream
It's hard to finally wake up, and find nothing's as it seems
(Nothing's quite what it seems)

[Pre-Chorus]
And my life's been a party
But when the party's over
There's nothin' left but the mess now

[Chorus]
It's just me
Standin' alone in this flashy town
It's just me
Hatin' myself, wishin' that someone would stick around
And it's just me, I need a friend
Someone that I can't just push away
It's just me, oh, yeah (Come on, yeah, uh)
You might also like[Bridge]
I know that once in your lifetime
The Lord above will shine and make it right
Pop songs are so full of questions
Sing along and look for directions
Today is all we got, though
Yesterday is gone, oh

[Chorus]
It's just me
Standin' alone in this flashy town
It's just me
Hatin' myself, wishin' that someone would stick around
And it's just me, I need a friend
Someone that I can't just push away
It's just me, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Outro]
(It's just me)
(It's just me)Embed
