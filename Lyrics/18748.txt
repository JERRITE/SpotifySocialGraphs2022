M-16 Lyrics[Verse 1]
The awe of love pulled out of the roots
Just rolling thunder we found
Pregnant with the tears of shame
But never let 'em out

[Pre-Chorus]
We shoot 'em down
We shoot 'em down (Down)
We shoot 'em down, down, down, down
[Chorus]
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Vendetta burns inside
Wiped out their lives for eyes unseen
Mercy chilled to the freezing point to the war

[Verse 2]
Blind religion, clouded minds
Called by the name of war
Two thirty-two, body penetration
Before you hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
We shoot 'em down
We shoot 'em down (Down)
We shoot 'em down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Vendetta burns inside
Wiped out their lives for eyes unseen
Mercy chilled to the freezing point
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Vendetta burns inside
Wiped out their lives for eyes unseen
Mercy chilled to the freezing point to the war
You might also like[Verse 3]
You are imploring to my aid
Machine gun fire scorn
Life corroded from inside
Remains in silent force

[Pre-Chorus]
We shoot 'em down
We shoot 'em down (Down)
We shoot 'em down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Vendetta burns inside
Wiped out their lives for eyes unseen
Mercy chilled to the freezing point
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Vendetta burns inside
Wiped out their lives for eyes unseen
Mercy chilled to the freezing point

[Outro]
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Free-fire zone with my M-16
Mercy chilled to the freezing point to the war1Embed
