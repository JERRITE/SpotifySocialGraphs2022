Man’s World (Empress Of Remix) [feat. Pabllo Vittar] Lyrics[Intro]
La mujer piensa, la mujer puede, la mujer es tan capaz como el hombre

[Verse 1: MARINA]
Cheeks are rosy like a Boucher cherub
I'm a strawberry soda, raise my lashes to heaven
Stars in my hair running like a waterfall
Clouds in the whites of our eyes, we saw it all
Burnt me at the stake, you thought I was a witch
Centuries ago, now you just call me a bitch
[Chorus: MARINA]
Mother nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore

[Verse 2: Pabllo Vittar]
Marilyn's bungalow, it's number seven
In the pink palacе where men madе her legend
Owned by a sheik who killed thousands of gay men
I guess that's why he bought the campest hotel in LA then

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]
Mother nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore

[Post-Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]
If you have a mother, daughter, or a friend
Maybe it is time, time you comprehend
The world that you live in ain't the same one as theirs
So don't punish me for not being a man

[Bridge: MARINA]
Spring appears when the time is right
Women are violets coming to light
Don't underestimate the making of life
The planet has a funny way of stopping a fight
You might also like[Chorus: MARINA]
Mother nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore

[Post-Chorus: MARINA & Pabllo Vittar]
If you have a mother, daughter, or a friend
Maybe it is time, time you comprehend
The world that you live in ain't the same one as theirs
So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man

[Outro: MARINA]
So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man
'Cause I'm not a man
Que el sexo no sea lo que nos haga débiles, el sexo tiene que ser lo que nos haga fuertes2Embed
