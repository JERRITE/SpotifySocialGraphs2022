Vacuum Boy Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, uh-hmm

[Chorus]
They call me Vacuum Boy 'cause I'm so empty
I try to fill myself with whatever I can see
They call me Vacuum Boy, I suck at everything
I wanna feel fulfilled but it seems that I can't be
I'm empty

[Verse 1]
I used to have friends
Where did they go?
Now I'm all alone at this radio show
I'ma be that sad fucking 80-year old
Cane in my hand looking mad 'cause my gravy is cold
[Refrain]
I'm losing my head, where has it went?
I'm missing my heart, give me it back
It's getting so hard to give it a chance
Love ain't for everybody
I'm losing my head, where has it went?
I'm missing my heart, give me it back
I'm trying so hard to give it a chance
But I can't find anybody

[Chorus]
They call me Vacuum Boy 'cause I'm so empty
I try to fill myself with whatever I can see
They call me Vacuum Boy, I suck at everything
I wanna feel fulfilled but it seems that I can't be
I'm empty

[Verse 2]
I used to smile more
I used to sing music and vibe
Now I'm used to getting used and use this music to cry
Am I stupid?
Why'd I choose to fucking tell you goodbye?
I held you at night and now I'm holding on by a line
Am I out my mind?
I lost my train of thought
Sittin' on this plane to yet another place you're not
Hoppin' on the bus to play another show
My fans are screaming down below
But all I hear is your voice in my thoughts
God! Man, fuck this shit

They call me Vacuum Boy 'cause I'm so empty
I try to fill myself with whatever I can see
They call me Vacuum Boy, I suck at everything
I wanna feel fulfilled but it seems that I can't be
I'm empty

[Refrain]
I'm losing my head, where has it went?
I'm missing my heart, give me it back
It's getting so hard to give it a chance
Love ain't for everybody
I'm losing my head, where has it went?
I'm missing my heart, give me it back
I'm trying so hard to give it a chance
But I can't find anybody

[Chorus]
They call me Vacuum Boy 'cause I'm so empty
I try to fill myself with whatever I can see
They call me Vacuum Boy, I suck at everything
I wanna feel fulfilled but it seems that I can't be
I'm empty3Embed
