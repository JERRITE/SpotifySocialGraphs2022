Horse Called War Lyrics[Verse 1]
If the end be a comin'
I soon be a bummin'
All you Jesus freaks I hope you're wrong
I've got so much left to live for
All these religions without God's supervision
All you Jesus freaks you kill yourselves
All in the name of the Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna meet your maker
Soon he be comin' to town
You hear the horse a comin'
Mercy on your soul when you're found
[Chorus]
Been out ridin'
Ridin' a horse called war
Ain't no denyin'
You can't bury a horse called war

[Verse 2]
All of this hatin'
Just social masturbatin'
All you Jesus freaks we need you now
What the hell are you waiting for
Through all the pollution
Ain't seen no solution
For you Jesus freaks that ride the horse called war

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna meet your maker
Soon he be comin' to town
You hear the horse a comin'
Mercy on your soul when you're found

[Chorus]
Been out ridin'
Ridin' a horse called war
Ain't no denyin'
You can't bury a horse called war
You can't bury, thats right
You might also like[Solo]

[Bridge]
Everyone's talkin'
But nobody's walkin'
We keep feedin'
It keeps eatin'
We'll be down, down, down on the killin' floor

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna meet your maker
Soon he be comin' to town
You hear the horse a comin'
Mercy, Lord, on your soul when you're found

[Chorus]
Been out ridin'
Ridin' a horse called war
Ain't no denyin'
You can't bury a horse called war
Been out ridin'
Ridin' a horse called war
Ain't no denyin'
You can't bury child, yeah thats right
Comin', he's comin', yeahEmbed
