Broken Trust Lyrics[Chorus: Mishaal]
Girl, how'll I love you? I can't love myself
Each day I wake I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you? I can't love myself
Each day I wake I wish I'm someone else

[Verse: SadBoyProlific]
Uh, I swear these days I can't even hold conversations
Gave you my trust, when everyone said you'd break it
I got lost in the sadness, in ways of hatred
Now I'm battling myself and I don't know if I'ma make it
Weight of the world on my back but I'm still standing
We never seem to see the things we take for granted
Since six, I was wishing I was on a different planet
We say we're depressed, they say we don't understand it
Funny 'cause I've known I was different for a while
Especially when they tell us the norm is to go and smile
I bet you that your angriest is me just being mild
What's a beast to society was something that's just wild
And what's someone my age these days besides a fucking child
My confidence just left my chest to single fucking file
I'm screaming at the mirror with my blood all on the tile
When we're at our lowest we forget that death is final
Most of us, but these days it's like I don't
You'll be dead too, keep copying your idols
The shit I spit isn't some meaningless recital
It's the truth, then I'll spit it 'til the day that I slit my throat
Circles growing smaller I'm startin' to see the signs
I got no regrets for those I had to leave behind
They held their hand out while the other had a knife
You can only get stabbed by the people right by your side
I wake up roll another blunt, and smoke it 'til the roach is done
Hoping that this dope fills my lungs, so I don't go feel the gun
Yeah, they think we kill ourselves for fun
Keep laughing 'cause I'm fuckin' done
[Chorus:  Mishaal]
Girl, how'll I love you? I can't love myself
Each day I wake I wish I'm someone else
Girl, how'll I love you? I can't love myself
Each day I wake I wish I'm someone elseYou might also like7Embed
