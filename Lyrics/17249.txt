Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishin' I could hold you now...
When you were here for me, I was not there for you
I was too blind, couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do

[Bridge: Faydee, Costi]
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
