Dirty AF1s Lyrics[Verse 1]
You took your smile back to New York
But you left your toothbrush
And I hope you bought a new one but I'd love you toothless
I used to sing while in the shower, now I don't
'Cause you're not there to sing along
While you put your makeup on
You took your smile back to New York
But you left your toothbrush

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd love you just the same
But I'm worried words lose weight
Does it hit you just as hard from three thousand miles away?
From three thousand miles away, from three
[Chorus]
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my nice shoes on so strangers can't tell
That I miss your dirty Air Force 1s
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my favourite shirt on so strangers don't know
That it looks way better on you

[Verse 2]
Took my heart to California, now it doesn't work right
Yeah, it beats and, yeah, it bleeds, but damn, it hurts every night
You're not lonely just because you are alone
But ever since we said goodbye, well, I just happen to be both
I took my heart to California, now it's broken

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love you just the same
But I'm worried words lose weight
Does it hit you just as hard from three thousand miles away?
From three thousand miles away, from three

[Chorus]
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my nice shoes on so strangers can't tell
That I miss your dirty Air Force 1s
I used to like to go out before I met you
Now I just go out to forget you
Put my favorite shirt on so strangers don't know
That it looks way better on youYou might also like4Embed
