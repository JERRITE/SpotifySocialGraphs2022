Lovelovelove Lyrics[백예린 "Lovelovelove" 가사]

[Verse 1]
If I ever have to leave
Where would I go?
Should I really have to leave?
Where do you think I should be?
You know I always wanna be
Somewhere or anywhere that near by you
I wanna make this love clearly
Make it more longer, make it more stronger
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wish we’ll be together
When life makes us apart
And tears us apart

[Chorus]
You’re the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind
Pounding in my heart
You’re everything in my head
You’re the dreams I’ve always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path
My love

[Verse 2]
I know you always try so hard
Whenever or where we are, you’re near by me
I know we always love so deep
Made it for long time, let’s make it last longer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wish we’ll be together
When life makes us apart
And tears us apart
You might also like[Chorus]
You’re the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind
Pounding in my heart
You’re everything in my head
You’re the dreams I’ve always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path
My love

[Bridge]
Too many ups and downs
We had been through together
Above love
You are more than my everything
To me, oh, you are

[Chorus]
You’re the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind
Pounding in my heart
You’re everything in my head
You’re the dreams I’ve always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path
My love
You’re the poet in my heart
The changes in my mind
Pounding in my heart
You’re everything in my head
You’re the dreams I’ve always wished
A chance to be better
Flowers in my path
My loveEmbed
