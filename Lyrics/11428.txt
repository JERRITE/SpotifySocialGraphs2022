Dark End of the Street LyricsAt the dark end of the street
That's where we will always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to right our wrong

You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
But our love keeps comin' on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
Someday they may come along and find us alone somewhere

You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

And when the daylight cover rolls around
And if by chance we're both taken in and taken downtown
But if we should meet before then, then just walk on by
Oh, sweet baby, please don't you cry

Cuz tonight we'll share the same dream
At the dark end of the street
You and me
You and me
You and me
