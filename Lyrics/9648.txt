Damaged (Global Factory radio edit) Lyrics(Shannon)
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound
Tell me are, are, are, are you
Are you patient, understanding?
Cause I might need some time
To clear the hole in my heart, and I…

(Group)
I've tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me
(D. Woods)
Baby, this situation is
Driving me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady
But the one before you left me so

(Aundrea and Group)
Damaged (damaged), damaged (damaged)
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged (damaged)
So damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before

(Aundrea)
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound
Tell me are, are, are, are you
Are you patient, understanding
Cause I might need some time
To clear the hold on my heart and I

You tried to gain my trust
Talking is not enough
Actions speak louder than words
You gotta show me something
My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again
