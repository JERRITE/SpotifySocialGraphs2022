Why iii Love The Moon. Lyrics[Intro: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about what it seems to be
You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every night up out my window
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every single night I look outside
It's right there for me
And my mind
And that's why I love the moon, yeah
Because people can consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night
[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds
So be careful where you look for love, ohh
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds us all
So be careful where you look for love-ove
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh

[Verse 2: Sheriff PJ]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, that's why I let the moon shine
('Cause through the time I've been confused on how to move on)
I'm stuck in between what wasn't and what could be the truth, ha
(Still up tryna escape the demons in my room, yo)
You see it's no change droppin' we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody else feel pain when they brainwash us?
And watch us every time we make exchanges (We slaves)
Locked in a box, we use our mind just to escape all the same shit
I'm tired of the pain
Love is blind to the flame
That's why I look up, never hide behind sky's when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin' through denyin' the pain
That's why I look for ways find whatever lies in the rain
'Cause shit change
I don't blame my father for lampin' I believe that helped
Went from tryna grow as your son to tryna grow as myself
So understand it when I'm stranded, takin' chances
Know I need that fall
Flat on my back, you just relax and kick your seat back, uh
'Cause when you think
That's when you let time run and escape what your mind loving
That's what you think
So what you think?
If love was easy to find, we wouldn't need it to complete our lives
So
