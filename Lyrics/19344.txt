Wish Youâ€™d Make Me Cry Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I'm getting bored, I start some drama
And when I'm too fucked up, you let me yell
When I chew you out, you're so unbothered
I'm tryna stir it up, I need your help

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's only natural
But can we pretend to be cruel?

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my own medicine
I wish you'd make me cry
[Verse 2]
I get angry and I try to call it off
But you don't play along, you keep it fair
You keep saying you just want good karma (Good karma, karma)
But she's a bitch like me who doesn't care (Care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's only natural
But can we pretend to be cruel?

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my own medicine
I wish you'd make me cry

[Post-Chorus]
I wish you'd make me cry

[Bridge]
Can we just forget that we're in love real quick
And tell me all 'bout how you want me to change?
Don't you hate it when I hate on all your newest kicks?
And when I never say I'm wrong
Or how I get when we're alone
And I am always on my phone
I wish that you would tell me off
You might also like[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wish you'd make me cry
Sometimes, I wish that we could fight
Tell me, don't you hate it? Perfect's overrated
Tell the nice guy to give me a taste of my own medicine
I wish you'd make me cry

[Post-Chorus]
Make me cry
Make me cry
Make me cry
I wish you'd make me cry4Embed
