Risk Takers Lyrics[Intro]
You don't know what it took
You don't know what it took

[Chorus]
Left hand can't do much but I can cook with it here
Not like that other shit you had, I can't even fuck with this here
Hundred bands on a chain, tell 'em look at this here
We took the risk, nigga, you don't know what it took to get here
Can't hit the block without the shine, what it took to get here
Stand down hard times, what it took to get here
Lotta pain, a lot of crying, what it took to get here
And I'm all out my mind, just to get here
[Verse]
Window shopping for a chain tell 'em look at this here
Egg beater on a counter, tеll 'em cook with this here
Too much monеy in a bank for me to trip with this here
And these scars on me show you what it took to get here
Sacrificing all my time, like a Patek I'm worth it
I spend that lil' shit on shoes, what they asking for verses
If I fuck up on my rap then I'm back rehearsing
If that wound still open, then it's back to surgery
Out here leaking, red flag bleeding
I'm on demon time, I'm the faeces
Shark in that water, Willie Beamen
He a lame, he can't get a pair of [?]
If you knew what it took, you would bleed black
Shot that nigga homie, gotta leave bad
Adam Silver with the play, got the league back
Fucking with the homie gotta leave black
Run it up 'til the bank call, yuh, yuh
Stuff it in 'til the safe full, yuh, yuh
Dead men in my pocket and they white
I'm great with that right and you know my

[Chorus]
Left hand can't do much but I can cook with it here
Not like that other shit you had, I can't even fuck with this here
Hundred bands on a chain, tell 'em look at this here
We took the risk, nigga, you don't know what it took to get here
Can't hit the block without the shine, what it took to get here
Stand down hard times, what it took to get here
Lotta pain, a lot of crying, what it took to get here
And I'm all out my mind, just to get here
