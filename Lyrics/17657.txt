Walk Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
A cold and lonely winters day
Around me only rain surrounded by the silence
Can't find my way back, back to where I came from
To that summer day when you just walked away

You took me to the lakeside
That's where we'd meet
Hanging by the orchards
Sleeping under trees
We ran into the water
My hands are on your waist
You were so much harder
I was there to stay
But you just walked away

[Chorus]
You just walked away
You just walked away
Yeah you just walked away

[Verse 2]
Trying to hold on to the dream
I'm painting all the scenes in which I still believe
I found my way back, back to where we came from
To that summer day when you just walked away

I'll take you to the lakeside
That's where we will meet
Hanging by the orchards
We'll sleep under the trees

We'll go into the water
My hands are on your waist
You're still so much harder
I'm still here to stay
So don't you walk away
You might also like[Bridge]
So don't you walk away
You're still so much harder
I'm still here to stay
So don't you walk away

[Chorus]
So don't you walk away
So don't you walk away
So don't you walk away
So don't you walk away
You're still so much harder

I'm still here to stay
So don't you walk awayEmbed
