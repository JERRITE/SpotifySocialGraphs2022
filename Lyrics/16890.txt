Mixtape LyricsWe've always been all over the map
Kinda messed up lovers
But we found a common ground
Playing twister under the covers

We don't have much to say
No, we ain't much for talkin'
But we've got a secret that keeps
More than the front porch rocking

We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
We can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repeat, repeat
We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
Wе can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repеat, repeat
Oh oh oh

(Who's that knocking?)

Well our neighbors, they get mad every single time we do it
'Cause they know I'm tapping more than just my feet to the music
Lately we're operating smoother than a surgeon
So tonight we might just have to play the extended version

We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
We can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repeat, repeat

We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
We can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repeat, repeat
Oh oh oh

(Don't stop it now)
You might also likeI wanna sex you up
Let's talk about sex, baby
Sexual healing
I'm bringing sexy back
And coming up next
Sex and candy

We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
We can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repeat, repeat

We're a mixtape
Every song has sex in the title
We can't turn it off so I turn it on
Repeat, repeat, repeat

Yeah
Whoa
Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat

We're all over the map, baby
Kinda messed up lovers, to be honest

Alright, play it againEmbed
