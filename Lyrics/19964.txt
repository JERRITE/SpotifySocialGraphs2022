Fall (Everything)
Fall (Everything)
Fall (Everything)
It’s dissolving
Fall (Everything)
Fall (Everything)
Fall (Everything)
It’s all falling

[Verse 1: SUGA, j-hope]
My life’s ruined all because of you
I’m so done with it, I don’t want you anymore
I just can’t do it, I don’t give a shit
So please, your excuse won’t even work
You can’t do this to me
Everything you said, it’s just to cover your fault
Just cover up the truth and rip me off
You spear me, make me go nuts, I hate it all
Take it all back with you, I hate you so bad
[Pre-Chorus: V, SUGA, RM]
But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Please get out of my life, huh
I’m sorry (You’re my)
I love you (You’re my)
Forgive me (Shit)

[Chorus: Jimin]
I need you, girl
Why do I love you and try to forget you
When I know you don't care?
I need you, girl
Why do I need you when I know it hurts me?

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, RM, RM & Jimin]
I need you, girl (You’re beautiful)
I need you, girl (You’re so cold)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)

[Verse 2: RM, V, V & Jung Kook]
It goes round and round, why do I keep coming back?
I go down and down, it feels like I’m a fool
Nothing can help me
It’s my heart, my mind and my soul, but they don't listen to me
Oh well, I’m just talking to myself again (Talking to myself again)
I’m just talking to myself again (Talking to myself again)
But you don't say anything, please, I’ll do my best
The sky is blue again (It's blue again)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
Maybe it's because the sky is blue, and the sun is shiny
My tears stick out
Why am I so into you, why you?
Why can’t I leave you?

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
I need you, girl
Why do I love you and try to forget you
When I know you don't care?
I need you, girl
Why do I need you when I know it hurts me?

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, RM, RM & Jung Kook]
I need you, girl (You’re beautiful)
I need you, girl (You’re so cold)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)

[Bridge: Jin, V, Jung Kook, Jimin & Jung Kook]
Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn’t love, oh
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can’t ever go back to you, oh-oh
[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin]
I need you, girl (Oh)
Why do I love you and try to forget you (Oh, baby)
When I know you don't care?
I need you girl (Why?)
Why do I need you when I know it hurts me?

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, RM, RM & Jung Kook]
I need you, girl (You’re beautiful)
I need you, girl (You’re so cold)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)
I need you, girl (I need you, girl)7Embed
