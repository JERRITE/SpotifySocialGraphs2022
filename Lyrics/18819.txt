Filth Upon Filth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sudden restrain
Plotting to escape
Rotting stench
Corrosion remains
I’ll never be this way again
Can I make amends?

[Pre-Chorus]
Filled inside with the doubt
Of my mind’s eye
[Chorus]
Filth upon filth
Persistence deceit
Filth upon filth
Consistent destiny

[Verse 2]
Suffocate
Strangle the past
Existing far beyond your own intention
Just to witness your demise
Blind to the reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
Filled inside with the doubt
Of my mind’s eye

[Chorus]
Filth upon filth
Persistence decеit
Filth upon filth
Consistent destiny

[Bridge]
I taste thе blood in my throat
All your hate gives me hope
Time expires, slow speed
Much like dreams’ insanity
