Fickle Game Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want to be older
I want to be stronger
I don't want to fall at the start
I want to be quicker
I want to get closer
I don't want to feel worlds apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I'm fast enough to get in trouble and not fast enough to get away
And I'm old enough to know I'll end up dying and not young enough to forget again
[Chorus]
It's all a fickle game
Life's a fickle game we play

[Verse 2]
I want to be older
I want to be stronger
I don't want to fall at the start
I want to be quicker
I want to get closer
I don't want to be worlds apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I'm fast enough to get in trouble and not fast enough to get away
And I'm old enough to know I'll end up dying and not young enough to forget again

[Chorus]
It's all a fickle game
Life's a fickle game we play

[Interlude]
It's a fickle game

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I'm fast enough to get in trouble and not fast enough to get away
I'm old enough to know I'll end up dying and not young enough to forget again
[Outro/Chorus]
I'm sick of fickle games
Life's a fickle game we play1Embed
