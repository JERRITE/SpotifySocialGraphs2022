TranslationsDeutschIrrelevant Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think it might rain today
Ash on the ground
Took all the heat we could take
And then burnt it down
Now it's a real parade
We're all welcome now
As long as you feel afraid
That's what's it about

[Pre-Chorus]
You can call me irrelevant, insignificant
You can try to make me small
I'll be your heretic, you fuckin' hypocrite
I won't think of you at all
Sticks and stones and all that shit
Does Jesus love the ignorant?
I like to think he'd gladly take us all
[Chorus]
The kids are not alright
None of us are right
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight
'Cause I still feel alive
The kids are not alright  (Not alright)
None of us are right (None of us are right)
I'm tirеd, but I won't sleep tonight
'Cause I still feel alive

[Verse 2]
I can't tell thе difference
Between fight or flight
I guess I'm indifferent
Since I don't have the right
I stay under covers now
I'm afraid to go out
I'll wait for tornadoes
To come take me out

[Pre-Chorus]
You can say that I'm ignorant, insignificant
But I've been here all along
I'll be your heretic, you fuckin' hypocrite
You can't ever catch us all
Sticks and stones and all that shit
Does Jesus know I'm innocent?
I'd like to think he'd gladly take us all
You might also like[Chorus]
The kids are not alright, no (Not alright)
None of us are right (None of us are right)
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight
'Cause I still feel alive
The kids are not alright (The kids are not alright)
None of us are right (None of us are right)
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight
'Cause I still feel alive
Oh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Girls just wanna have rights
So why do we have to fight? (Oh)
Girls just wanna have rights
So why do we have to fight? (Oh)
Girls just wanna have rights
So why do we have to fight? (Whoa, yeah)
Girls just wanna have rights (Oh-oh, yeah)
So why do we still have to fight? (Oh)

[Chorus]
The kids are not alright, no
'Cause none of us are right
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight
'Cause I still feel alive
These kids are not alright
None of us are right
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight
I still feel alive
[Outro]
You can call me irrelevant, insignificant
I won't call on you at all3Embed
