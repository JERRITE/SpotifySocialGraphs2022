Nutcase Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I had one wish and one wish only
I'd bottle up home and I'd drink it when I'm lonely
Solo every night 'til six in the morning
If this is paradise I wish somebody warned me
Only see my brother every two or three months now
Had a lot in common back then there ain't much now
Can't refer to my friends as my friends
'Cause if I was really one I would check up on them
I like to think that they proud of me
And that they understand what this shit is taking out of me
I'm hangin' on by a thread
Think I got it all together but I am
[Chorus]
Still a nutcase, still a psycho
Tellin' mama any day I might blow up
Stayin' up late, where did time go?
Still ain't caught a break but I'm like, "So what?"
Will my luck change? Fuck if I know
If I hear another "no" I might throw up
I'm a nutcase, I'm a psycho I'm a psycho
But any day I might blow up!
Any any day now, any day, any day
Any day now
Any any day now, any day, any day

[Verse 2]
If I used that wish, but then I got an extra
I'd clip my memories then make a "best of"
Watch my family before it got messed up
Seeing them together would be better than the best drugs
Told myself when I make it I'll fix that
Deep down I know I won't get it back
I don't want no money as funny as it sounds
If that was gonna fix it it'd done it by now
I like to think I'm a sacrifice
Just a little longer 'fore I get to live a happy life
I'm hangin' on by a thread
Think I got it all together but I am
You might also like[Chorus]
Still a nutcase, still a psycho
Tellin' mama any day I might blow up
Stayin' up late, where did time go?
Still ain't caught a break but I'm like, "So what?"
Will my luck change? Fuck if I know
If I hear another "no" I might throw up
I'm a nutcase, I'm a psycho I'm a psycho
But any day I might blow up!
Any any day now, any day, any day
Any day now
Any any day now, any day, any day
Any day, any day, any day
I might blow up!
Any day, any day, any day
I might blow up!4Embed
