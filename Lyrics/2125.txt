More Than a Band Lyrics[Verse 1: Naomi Scott & Adam Hicks]
I can't pretend
To know how you feel
But know that I'm here
Know that I'm real
Say what you want
Or don't talk at all
Not gonna let you fall

[Chorus: Naomi Scott]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are small
But you can cry on them too
Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band
Yeah
[Verse 2: Hayley Kiyoko, Blake Michael, & All]
You used to brave the world
All on your own
Now we won't let you go
Go it alone
Be who you wanna be
Always stand tall
Not gonna let you fall

[Chorus: All]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too
Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band

[Bridge: Bridgit Mendler]
I never knew
You could take me so far
I've always wanted the hope that you are
The ones I need

[Chorus: All]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too
Cry on them too
Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band
You might also like[Outro: Bridgit Mendler]
Reach for my hand
'Cause it's held out for you
My shoulders are strong
But you can cry on them too
Everything changes
But one thing is true
Understand
We'll always be more than a band2Embed
