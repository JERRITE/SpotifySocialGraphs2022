Northern Towns LyricsMake it so the handsome way of what never was
Turns to overcast what has become
Do away with that which makes a moment so discrete
We hesitate, ashamed to really laugh or really weep

Maybe a man is worth the weight of what his eyes have seen
Maybe there's a branch of wonder left here to believe
There are places with horizons above a level ground
A man's as much as the love he leaves behind in northern towns

Make it so what makes us mindful without reprimand
Falls behind the eyes of every man
If the story of our lives becomes our sufferings penned and left
Begin to recount every time you ever really wept
Maybe a man is worth the weight of what his eyes have seen
Maybe there's a branch of wonder left here to believe
There are places with horizons above a level ground
A man's as much as the love he leaves behind in northern townsYou might also likeEmbed
