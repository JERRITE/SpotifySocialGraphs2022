Miss Cigarette Lyrics[Intro]
Rizzle Kicks
Die-ie-ie-ie
Disillusion

[Verse 1: Jordan]
Hmm yeah, I love it when my lips are on her
There’s a spark in our relationship, I plant a kiss upon her
I fuck around too much and there’s a risk that I’m a goner
So I’ve got her on hand, like a badge of honour
The downside is, she’s never there when I’m lacking dollar
So I’ve got to try and go through a day without acting bothered
In the hope she’d leave me alone because I’m better off her
But I see that butt, and I just accept the offer
[Verse 2: Harley]
So many people say why are you with her
And I’m like she’s a damn good kisser
She feeds my addiction
She leaks something different
The smoke from our last meeting has risen
Keep her away from all of the other boys
Cause you know she’s every single cutters choice
Always there when the cold nights are lurking
Gotta keep hold of my golden virgin

[Chorus: Jordan & Harley]
I think she’s good for me
Thats why I wouldn't leave
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be
She’s there when I’m in need
But she isn’t cheap
The last time I saw her
Broski I couldn’t breathe
And they say she’s bad for me
And they say she’s bad for me
I don’t think she’s bad for me
But it’s a bit of a disillusion

[Verse 3: Jordan]
She’s got a mate called Benson
But he’s a bit of a waste guy
Always chats about silver and gold
But I don’t reckon he’s Sway (right?)
Plus his mate like’s to come out at break time
Tries to act bad but I’ve smoked him like 8 times
And if I take ya the wrong places then I face a fine
If I don't take in what she says it's a waste of time
In fact she doesn’t lie
She tells me that she’s bad for me
Even when I patch things up, I don’t think that I had to leave
You might also like[Verse 4: Harley]
I said I had to leave
I had to get away
Cause frankly when I’m not around her I’ve seen better days
Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case
But when I’m chilling she’s always in my mind
I do have doubts but those doubts just get lost inside
I should respond in time but then I found out
The last boy she kissed coughed and died

[Chorus]
I think she’s good for me
Thats why I wouldn't leave
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be
She’s there when I’m in need
But she isn’t cheap
The last time I saw her
Broski I couldn’t breathe
And they say she’s bad for me
And they say she’s bad for me
I don’t think she’s bad for me
But it’s a bit of a disillusion

[Verse 4: Jordan & Harley]
M-I-S-S C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be
M-I-S-S C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be
Can you please leave my vicinity
Can you please leave my vicinity
Actually wait nah I’ll have another kiss
Ah shit I’m in love with this chick
What this its straight robbery
She’s always there when I’m by myself and I can’t remain solitary
Babe honestly
It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty
You went from my pal to my lover
Now I see you outside with thousands of others
But you’re on my mind right now
So it's obvious I’m down for another little fling
Gotta confess this
[Chorus]
I think she’s good for me
Thats why I wouldn't leave
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be
She’s there when I’m in need
But she isn’t cheap
The last time I saw her
Broski I couldn’t breathe
And they say she’s bad for me
And they say she’s bad for me
I don’t think she’s bad for me
But it’s a bit of a disillusion2Embed
