Just Vibe Lyrics[Intro]
Danny, I see you
Wyt

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe (Vibe)
Stickin' this dick in her side (Side)
She ain't got no ass but got thighs (Uh)
Hop in the coupe and let's ride (Ride)
I put Chanel on her eyes (Uh)
Two karat ring for surprise (Yeah)
Maybach backseat that recline ('Cline)
Roll up some Cookie, get high (High)
I can't even lie, I'm feelin' your vibe
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl, you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibe
[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I can get what I want and I want you
We got good vibes when we come through
I got karats and lettuce like vegetables
Stick it in her mouth like it was edible
Summertime come, I'ma cut off the roof
I put hundreds on the pillow like she lost a tooth
Double C on my shoe, that cost a deuce
Yeah, turn your ho to a masseuse
I got rich, I came up from the poverty
Different color gold like Neapolitan
She got an ass like she half hippopotamus
Spendin' money, I got a whole lot of it
Two bad bitches right on the side of me
I ain't a player, she said that you gotta be
She robbin', I lay it down like a robbery
I run my money up, is you proud of me?

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe (Vibe)
Stickin' this dick in her side (Side)
She ain't got no ass but got thighs (Uh)
Hop in the coupe and let's ride (Ride)
I put Chanel on her eyes (Uh)
Two karat ring for surprise (Yeah)
Maybach backseat that recline ('Cline)
Roll up some Cookie, get high (High)
I can't even lie, I'm feelin' your vibe
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl, you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibe

Fuck a bitch every day, I don't get tired
Racks in, I might throw some nut in her eye
Amiri jeans helped me find me size
Drip or drown, nigga, I hope you don't dive
In the city and I'm still havin' vibes
My bitch is a mistress, I don't want a bride
If it's for pussy, I don't wanna buy it
Like the kid at the pool, bae, I just wanna slide
Ice in the face so it's hard to tell time
Instead of just hoes I been callin' 'em vibes
They came to the Gunna, wake up to massage
She blowin' up my phone, this bitch harder to dodge
Got her pregnant, had to buy her a Dodge
Rent a million, this is not a facade
I stick it in like I charge an iPod
Dick in her back, fucked her in the garage

[Chorus: Gunna & Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I dig her vibe (Vibe)
Stickin' this dick in her side (Side)
She ain't got no ass but got thighs (Uh)
Hop in the coupe and let's ride (Ride)
I put Chanel on her eyes (Uh)
Two karat ring for surprise (Yeah)
Maybach backseat that recline ('Cline)
Roll up some Cookie, get high (High)
I can't even lie, I'm feelin' your vibe
Yeah, I wanna dig in her thighs
She fuck with a winner, that pussy a prize
We shoppin', everything she want, I'm buyin'
Damn girl, you fine
She look like she walk down the runway
I need a runway, we be flyin'
Take a vacation with bad bitches
Ain't no relationship, we just vibeEmbed
