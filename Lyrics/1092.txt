TranslationsEspañolOpposite Of Loving Me (Stripped) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can only be so sorry
And you can only try so hard
But tears will always leave you drowning
And cuts will always leave you scarred

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time
The only one on my mind
I guess you've been
Been living some other life
[Chorus]
’Cause I don't remember
Saying, "Let's fight every night
Let’s never get it right, only bad times"
No, I don't remember
When I met your mom and dad
Saying this will never last for a lifetime
Oh, I don't remember
Us never taking hands
Making temporary plans with you
No, I don't remember
Saying everything needs to be
The opposite of loving me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The opposite of loving me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no
The opposite of loving me

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna not think about you
I'm tryna not want you back
But love isn't a switch you can turn on
That you can turn off just like that

[Pre-Chorus]
The only one that's on my mind
I guess you’ve been
Been living some other life
You might also like[Chorus]
’Cause I don't remember
Saying, "Let’s fight every night
Let's never get it right, only bad times"
No, I don't remember
When I met your mom and dad
Saying this will never last for a lifetime
Oh, I don't remember
Us never taking hands
Making temporary plans with you
No, I don’t remember
Saying everything needs to be
The opposite of loving me

[Bridge]
Don't know what it was, everything's become
The opposite of loving me
Don't know what it was, everything's become
The opposite of loving me
Don't know what it was, everything's become
The opposite of loving me
Don't know what it was, everything's become
The opposite of loving me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't remember
Saying, "Let's fight every night
Let's never get it right, only bad times"
No, I don't remember
When I met your mom and dad
Saying this will never last for a lifetime
Oh, I don't remember
Us never taking hands
Making temporary plans with you
No, I don't remember
Saying everything needs to be
The opposite of loving me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The opposite of loving me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no
The opposite of loving me2Embed
