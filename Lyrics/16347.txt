The Big Guns Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you praise him, then you thank him
'Til you reach the by-and-by
And I've won hundreds at the track
But I'm not bettin' on the afterlife

[Verse 2]
Then you kiss his lips
He forgives you for it
He forgives you for all you've done
But not me
I'm still angry
[Chorus]
What have I done?
Why am I always missing with
The big guns?

[Verse 3]
First, I'll build a sword
Get some words to explain
It's a plan, brother, at least
And I'll pretend that everybody here wants peace
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me
'Cause we're tired and lonely and we're bloody

[Chorus]
What have we done?
Why are we still runnin'
From our own failing bodies?
The big guns
The big guns

[Bridge]
Sing mercy, sing mercy, sing mercy on me
Let's pretend that everybody here wants peace

[Chorus]
What have we done?
Why are we still chasing our own tails and running
From the big guns?
The big guns
