I been tripping all week off the narcotics
Take off on Pluto, got some hoes beside me (Nyoom)
Sipping Hi-Tech, moving like a zombie
That boy say he looking for me, come and find me
Pull up with Trippie and we tweaking (Tweak)
VVS's on me blinging (Bling)
Smoking dope with the demons
Dress according to the seasons
Pop a Perc' then I leave this Earth, I ain't coming back
I'm making plays in the field like a running back
Louis V tennis shoes, I'm trapping on avenues (Avenues)
Alexander McQueen my protégé (Protégé)
I'm sipping on lean not on lemonade
I pop me a xan then I levitate (Levitate)
You can't live how I live
Cause I wake up every day with pints in my fridge

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Lil Tracy]
Ayy, all my life I been limitless, nigga never had a limit, huh
Yeah, rollin' around in the 'Rari, you still in the Civic
