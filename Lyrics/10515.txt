Imagining Lyrics[Intro/Hook]
Dont stop imagining
The day that you do is the day that you die
X2

[Verse]
I heard you had a hard time rememberin'
The longest road trip we ever did
And the medicine ain't gonna slow it down or make it better
When we talk i'll probably hear the last sentence that you said again
And again and again until I well up
I'm tryin' to be the man and keep my head and chin held up
But me and Steven going through it
We don't even speak about it
And we know that's your influence
I feel guilty I'm pursuing different paths so far away
We never used to talk but now hello is hard to say
When you got back from absence I felt things start to change
I let it breed as memories start to fade
Man, this shit is hard for me to deal with
I haven't wrapped my head around, not sure if I feel shit
But this empty heart is not me, we can't stop the loss of thoughts
But there is one thing you taught me and thats...
[Hook]
Dont stop imagining
The day that you do is the day that you die

[Verse]
And I was home when those tests came
We sat around the kitchen table
While we felt our chest cave
I died a bit inside, when Ry won that chess game...
That chess game, man I'm just sayin' ...im not angry
Nah wait, im angry as fuck
But im not angry at you, man, im angry at luck
Im angry that me and family and you had to be stuck
Watching the man that you were blow like granules of dust
But you raised acouple fighters
With fire in our eyes
We will be by your side til the (day that you die)
You taught me to question everything
You know I never lie
So was that day in june 09 really the (day that you died)
If your presence makes no sense when you close your eyes and reopen 'em
A clean slate every time your focus in broken then
Maybe you're a shell of your former self
And I'm hoping that your soul has flown home
And you feel no pain's how I cope with it, dad
Im glad you treat mom better now
Its the least you could do
After all the years you let her down
Take no offense im only talkin'
We can't stop the loss of thoughts
But there is one thing you taught me and its...

Dont stop imagining

[Verse]
We share a love of rock n roll
Baseball and bob clemente
Get to know him all you can
Thats what all my friends say
But they dont understand the end game
How can we heal?
Theres too many things you won't be comprehending
Your line of thought's too hard to grasp
Im glad you've taken to arts and crafts
If only we'd have started farther back
Theres so much I wish I could to say
I beg your pardon dad, man5Embed
