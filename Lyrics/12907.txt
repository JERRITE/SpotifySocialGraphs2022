You Want The Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Those summer nights, summer nights
I need to think of my life, my life
When the sun's in love with the sky
Yea, yea, yea
African violet and neon blue suits my eyes

[Chorus]
You want the sun
You want the sun, don't you?

[Verse 2]
I'm in love, I'm in love
But I need to know that we're good, oh
You been shaking in the ground wherever I been
So far, so far, baby
But this time, this love is rock, love is rock
You need to be flying

[Chorus]

[Outro]
