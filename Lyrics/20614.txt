Everything Beautiful Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the night falls, it's your hand in mine on the sidewalk
You're just an angel, yeah
Tryna find chaos, I'm the devil wantin' peace
I may never take a day off
Two lovers lost in the world, never lost one another
So high, so high, my blood runs cold
My love runs deep and when it all unfolds
As long as you're in my front seat

[Chorus]
I'll just keep my middle finger and my head high
It's so hard to see the Heaven through my red eyes
But as long as you're here by my bedside
I can still see the reason I'm here
And everything beautiful in this world
[Verse 2]
When the time calls, I'll lead you to bed with the lights off
I see your halo, yeah
You found me on the way down, I'm disguised as what you wish for
When you see it, it's too late now
Two lovers left the world behind, never left one another
So high, so high, my eyes so red
My heart so blue and when it's time to go
As long as I'm your go-to

[Chorus]
I'll just keep my middle finger and my head high
It's so hard to see Heaven through my red eyes
But as long as you're here by my bedside
I can still see the reason I'm here
And everything beautiful

[Bridge]
You're all that I need
More than enough by my side, high-speed
As long as I can love and be loved here
By the reason I breathe
As long as you're here with me

[Chorus]
I could keep my middle finger and my head high
It's so hard to see the Heaven through my red eyes
But as long as you're here by my bedside
I can still see the reason I'm here
And everything beautiful to me, yeah
