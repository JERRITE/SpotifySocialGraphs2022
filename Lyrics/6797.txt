LICC HOE$ Lyrics[Intro:]
Free Heist
187 shit
Ayy, haha

[Verse:]
And I'm all in your house
My wrist in the bowl like I'm playing with Klaus
I need an accountant don't got time to count
Then I pick up that ounce
I got to get this shit 'fore my bro get out
I got to go flip it remake that amount
Foenem got SK's and AR's they give you a scar
It's gon' see you up out of here
I dump a few clips in that cavalier
Jersey is finna be red like a Buccaneer
It ain't no fucking just suck in here 'till she tear up she is not getting none from here
I cannot afford to get stuck in here
I'm pulling out and won't fuck for another year
We the ones that pull up with the cuetes, or whip out the blade like an ese
Putting that lead on his ass like an essay
He wanna start some shit pussy boy press play
I'm coming with beef like a taco
My dick el grande, so this shit ain't Paco
He catch a concussion like Flacko
If he out bust then I Dash like I'm Roscoe
I'm lighting that wood on a payday
Watch for your mans if I catch him it's mayday
Got that baseball bat it's a melee, see you on freeway
Shooting shit both ways
Nigga want war I'm like okay
I catch that case then I go beat it like O.J
I cover shit up like it's Olay
We found out you rat it's a wrap like Chipotle
Yeah I'm all in the sauce and ain't Molly
That bitch wanna fuck with the boss do that often
I'm off that wood and I've fallen but I keep that medicine
So I ain't coughing, bitch, ay
Bruh 'lil shawty be caked up
Talking 'bout dope, but she dope with no makeup
Taking your face when you wake up
Brought the wood with me I still got to bake up
Nigga I'm smoking no sober
Don't know no probation don't fuck with the popers
I'm moving with shells you can find me all over
I take the pain I cut my vein 'till it's over
I am the Garcia Roller I roll up a wood take that bitch to the solar
I live with the wood like an ogre
She come over give me straight face like its poker
The popo is on me, don't answer no questions
I'm toting that 38, that Smith and Wesson
I really get groovy, just give me a second
These niggas too goofy, I'm shooting like Stephen
Choppa so big that I call that bitch Precious
Whenever I press it, it will get depressing
I got that thang but I will not suppress it
I give you some wings and you will get to heaven
Try me at 6 you won't make it to 7
The cops they gon' be on the case 'till 11
It take two hours to get the detectives, but by that time
Rigor Mortis it done set in
Body decay and get put into bedding
War with two K's now I feel like I'm Tekken
God for that shit boy I feel like a reverend
All black with this paper and I got a message
Then I'm all in your presence
That hoe got you out making runs with no effort
But I'm in the tum like that bitch just got pregnant
Fuck where you from nigga what is you repping
Like what you done been in like what work you put in?
You ain't been put on fuck nigga get put off
12 is behind me I can't take my foot off
Shit finna kick off like we playing football
Your hoe is gon' run off when I take my hood off
Said he gon' take me whenever he see me
Saw me in public 'lil buddy just took off
187 we pull off, whole team be eating together like cook-offs
I can't play no games nigga thinking I'm Rudolf
Pull up *graa* knock your whole roof off
[Outro:]
Ayy, yah
