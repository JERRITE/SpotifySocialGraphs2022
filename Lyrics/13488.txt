Mad About Bars - S4-E1 LyricsPart 1

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
M1OnTheBeat
I need you lot to understand one thing
If you wanna talk about one of the originators in this ting
You're looking at them right now
But I think some of you lot have forgotten
So let's remind you
Smoke Boys
Sleeks, Deepee, Swift
Smokey settings
Jheez
[Verse 1: Sleeks]
Fell in love with the trap
Elastic bands and cash, misch and mash, this and that
A thousand grams just come and it's already gone, that's no cap
Said you got all this P but you're tryna buy a iPhone X on Snap
Everything I rap is facts
Just sent out the morning text, just had the sim card cracked
Call me the Green Giant, sitting with all these packs
And I just done a morning round, now I'm sitting with all these racks

[Verse 2: Deepee]
I feel like Cain
I feel like Cain, I'm Abel and I got 'caine in 8 balls
I ain't got shame, that's shameful, brick I might break, big breakthrough
And I been great, been made to, ucky was great and it made me feel great too
Been a father and these niggas ungrateful, I just do greatness, I don't do lateness
Big bells put a boy down for braveness, I just need acres, I don't need neighbours
They just need favours, whole lot of favours, T vacuum with a whole lot of flavours
In the hoopty then my nigga upgraded
Big not man, I'm major, cookie, act like that's my fragrance

[Verse 3: Swift]
With gangdem doing up trips, them man love doing up lips
I put packs in cling, soon put them man in a rizz
Manbag with things and things, that's pack or skiddy, pap, pap or ching
Peng gyal wanna link big Swift but only if I can bring the thing
Used to be more than pissed when the jeans got ripped, now we buy them ripped
Used to have bruck down whips, bruck down kicks, now look at the drip
Whippin' excursion in the kitch', dashed in 3, I just got back 6
Risk, riff, gave it a mix like 6
You might also like[Verse 4: Deepee]
Pocket was bruck and I got that fix, them lies that you lie just fibs
I just chop that, drop that and let that fizz, ain't no middle man couldn't let man drink
Phone going off, they can't let man think
Mums home in a sec, it stinks
Bros got his neck on sync, big bulbs in the neck, it blinks

[Verse 5: Sleeks]
If this was New Jack City, I'm Nino
And I ain't picking up weights when you hear me talking kilos
And the engine stays in sport, broke niggas drive on eco
When the pack gets low, call up plug and bound for the reload

[Verse 6: Swift]
Touch bro, mans stepping, talking loads, ain't repping
Back then it was smokey settings, shellings, kweffings, a million wettings
Bro said that she's a trophy cah she helped you bring the skeng in
Tell them Smokey only, she was like "I swear you're Section"


Part 2

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
Ah right
N1 got the sauce baby
That was just gear one
Sykes I see you
Let's do this again
Sykes, Sykes
Smokey Boys, we see the internet talking
But I think you lot need to understand, these mans ain't playing no game this year
Listen to this
[Verse 1: Swift]
Little man wanna go country, he gotta do more than 1 week
Got the Humpty for a monkey, that's lovely jubbly
Bro said that car looks funny, it might be nuttin' or it might be undies
Duppy for bruv or cuzzy, that's family and that's on mumzy
Do road with bro, that's Bimmer and Benz's, man doing up country
I really don't know how I get these peng tings and mans so ugly
Should've taught man to press it, dead it, umm umm, I just want ucky
And it's getting man smoked like Benson, blem him, then go link mummy
They said they do road but umm I don't know, I don't believe their verses
Can't trust a soul, mans so-so nervous, had it in community service
Put slugs in turners, no gloves, still work it
I know plugs and workers, big-big money earners

[Verse 2: Sleeks]
Rap, stack, course we're trying
Said you got bands in the trap, got no cash, someone's lying
Said she wanna do my plaits, hold this wap until it's frying
Man fly them whole but some of them bricks they get divided
From young been running from Trident
Came up from the corner, now we just shut down Wireless
I remember going OT with Travis Scott and Kylie
Tryna get the bank rolls piling, bruck down whips with mileage
Now when I look back at the throwbacks, me and KK just smile it off
From a Q to a half to a whole block
T house, setting up phone shop
Them boy there got no guwop
They already said smoking kills
Still crush buds in the rizla, broccoli buds, no pills
Open the box like no spill

[Verse 3: Deepee]
Smoke in the flesh, live in the p-lace, I need a fresh, I need a clean slate
Had an arrest, I need a beat case, bus-i-ness man, put buds in the briefcase
Fuck all the long, done all the delay, you can get a brick on prepay
Drought but the price too high though, drag you out your wheels and sell it on eBay
Shell it on Gumtree, mum said I'm handsome, lifestyle ugly
Trust me, said it weren't us when she heard us on radio but she said must be
Sweets like Kinder but they come Kit Kat chunky
In and out of town in one week, OT Saturday, shelling on Sunday
Ay, caramba, see the undies, big pumpy, make you jumpy
Make you bungee, make you sizzle up like Kalonji, trap like dungrees
Know the feds want all the mandem on the landing for the fuckery
I hustle hard, no GoFundMe, I'm a jungle boy in Jumanji

[Outro: Kenny Allstar]

The nicest way to kick off a new season
