Erase You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe love is like tattoos, it stays with you
I tell myself that I've moved on, but I don't move
But why does it feel like it doesn't matter what I do?

[Chorus]
So if I could, I'd forget it all
Go back in time and rewind my fall for you
But I can't, you're written in my scars
And when it falls apart, I know I can't
Erase you from my heart, ooh
Erase you from my heart, ooh
Erase you from my heart
[Drop]
Erase you from my heart
Erase you from my heart
My heart, from my heart

[Verse 2]
There's always something left unsaid in our goodbyes
There's always tears I didn't shed, that I can't cry
But why does it feel like I'm never really over you?

[Chorus]
So if I could, I'd forget it all
Go back in time and rewind my fall for you
But I can't, you're written in my scars
And when it falls apart, I know I can't
Erase you from my heart, ooh
Erase you from my heart, ooh
Erase you from my heart

[Drop]
Erase you from my heart
Erase you from my heartYou might also like1Embed
