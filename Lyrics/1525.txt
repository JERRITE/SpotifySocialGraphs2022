Talking 2 You Lyrics[Chorus: Brandon]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the girls that we're talkin' about
So come on
Know I'm talkin' to you
Come on
All the girls standin' in the crowd (H Money!)

[Verse 1: Brandon]
Girl, I ain't a geezer (Nah)
Let me make you a believer
Take you overseas, out in Paris
You gon' need a bag and a visa
Goin' back and forth, don't ease up
You can rock the boat, Aaliyah
I'm trying to slide in the crib and get it again
[Pre-Chorus: Nick & All]
All the girls standin' in the crowd won't you shout!
If you're feelin' sexy, let me hear you scream and shout!
Oh, I just wanna hear you say my name when you shout!
When his eyes go away, you should stay

[Chorus: Zion]
So I can makе you shout, shout, let it all out (Let it all out)
Thesе are the girls that we're talkin' about
So come on
You know I'm talkin' to you
Come on
All the girls standin' in the crowd, you should shout
I'ma make you shout, shout, let it all out (Let it all out)
These are the girls we been dreamin' about
Come on (Come on)
You know I'm talkin' to you
Come on
All the girls standin' in the crowd, you should shout

[Verse 2: Edwin]
Your friends shouldn't envy, 'cause girl I got plenty
Come take a shot like you're shootin' from ten feet
I am the goal like I'm two-three
I don't wanna play no games (No)
Maybe you should come my way
You know I've been waitin' all day
I'ma need it right away
