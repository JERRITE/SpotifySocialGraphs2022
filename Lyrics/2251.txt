Your Side of the Bed (Steve Reece Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hope you never hear this
You probably can't deal with it
Hope your family's still doing great
I'm missing every Sunday
Friends probably hate me
Wish you'd never met me
Forget a happy ending

[Pre-Chorus]
Since you left it's one, two, three
Now he's coming in close to me
I can't sleep, 'cause he's where you're supposed to be and
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all of the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side
Now I'm up all night
[Chorus]
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed

[Verse 2]
Nights with your old friends
Think that you've got em'
Everyone say that you're better off
No, you don't believe em'
Staying at the bar till' 2
Then you stumble home all alone
While I take my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause since you left it's one, two, three
Now he's coming in close to me
I can't sleep, 'cause he's where you're supposed to be and
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all of the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side
Now I'm up all night

[Chorus]
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
You might also like[Bridge]
One, two, three
Whoa
I can't sleep
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side
Now I'm up all night

[Outro]
I got me someone else insteadEmbed
