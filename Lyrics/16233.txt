Raven’s Pie Lyrics[Intro: Raven-Symoné & Anthony Alabi]
Hey Coach Spitz...Pie?
Ooh, I love pie, I love apple, cherry, sweet potato
I bet you do, huh

[Verse 1: Raven-Symoné & Anthony Alabi]
Keep looking at this pie, I bet you want a piece
Give me one good reason why my baby ain't the lead
Ok, your baby can't act
What?
He can't shoot, and he sure can't rap
Well if you really want a slice, I bet you'll get past that
[Bridge: Raven-Symoné]
'Cause you ain't never had something so good
Hot and fresh out of the oven
Honey, you ain't getting none

[Chorus: Raven-Symoné]
I said hey, you'll testify if you want a piece of this pie
I said hey, you better make it right, if you want a piece of this pie
You better let my baby shine, or you get no key-lime
I said hey, you'll testify if you want a piece of this pie

[Verse 3: Raven-Symoné & Anthony Alabi]
Now, if he's not the lead, what part can he play?
Uh, I could give him front row seats?
No pie!
How about something behind the scenes?
No pie!
Just a little piece?
No pie!
Pretty, pretty please?
No pie!
I got it, he can play a tree!
Hmm, you don't want no pie!

[Bridge: Raven-Symoné]
You ain't never never had something so good
Hot and fresh out the oven
Honey, you ain't getting none!
I said hey!

Sweet potato, cherry, lemon, Apple strudel
Each one is delicious, but there's nothing for you though

[Chorus: Raven-Symoné]
I said hey, testify, if you want a piece of this pie
I said hey, you better make it right, if you want a piece of this pie
You better let my baby shine, or you get no key-lime
I said hey, testify if you want a piece of this pie

[Outro: Anthony Alabi & Raven-Symoné]
I got it, he can play Ref number one!
Any lines?
He's got a whistle
No pie!
How many times does he blow it?
It's for showin', not blowin'
No pie!
Alright, one, okay, two gut-wrenching whistles!
Now you get  a piece, now you get a piece
Now you get a piece of this pieEmbed
