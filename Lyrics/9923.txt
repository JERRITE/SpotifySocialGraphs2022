Poppin Shit Lyrics[Intro]
(Pipe that shit up, TNT)
(Why they mad?)

[Chorus: Jazlyn MyChelle]
Poppin' shit, Balenciaga, mmm, yeah
I'm the shit, I'm the topic, mmm, yeah
Long hair like Rapunzel, make sure my heart never fades
Singin' to the thunder, mmm

[Verse: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Singin' to the thunder, stayin' strong through the rain
Switched up for that bag, but can't get mad 'cause I won't change
Four-door matte black Jag' as I smash through the lanes
Huh, I know that shit sad, but I fall back 'cause all it lame
Poppin' shit, lovin' how you look in all that Dior
Millions, blow it, what she want, I get it for her
Diamonds hittin', they on galore, took off, hit this bitch, oh, Lord
I'm the shit, I know they know it, pop your shit, I'm all here for it
Take off, I'm thrashin', I'm aggin', I'm in it, I'm in this bitch, I know Lil' Top
My only girl, you know my ma
You know my hustle'll never stop, you know my grind'll never flop
See all these foreigns that's at my house
That hatin' shit, I make it stop, whip out that bag like, "Close your mouth"
[Chorus: Jazlyn MyChelle & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Poppin' shit, Balenciaga, mmm, yeah
I'm the shit, I'm the topic, mmm, yeah
Long hair like Rapunzel, make sure my heart never fades
Singin' to the thunder, mmm
Poppin' shit, Bentayga, mmm, yeah
I'm the shit, I'm the topic, mmm, yeah
Long hair like Rapunzel, make sure my heart never fades
Singin' to the thunder, mmmYou might also like1Embed
