Chasing Shadows Lyrics360, 5 left, I’m counting it to the day
I’m thinking if I did everything I said, or if the year got the best of me
One thing about time, it waits for nobody, you told me, isn’t that what they say
Been batting ‘gainst it and getting nowhere, just racin’ got nothing to say to nobody
Little lady you better get in line, now I’m talking this to myself
Better get in on down with the program, don’t sell your lot for an old broke dream they been sellin’ ya
Free fallin like Tom Petty, waitin’ on this rodeo to haul
I break my own rules, steal my way home, and guard the still there like a beast

We race the globe
The shakers and the fools
We trouble you know
You’ll find us where we fall, we chasing shadows
And I can’t have it, have it any other way
And I can’t have it, have it any other way
I’m not gon’ have it, have it any other way
And I can’t have it, have it any other way
Always knew I’d be international
No fear of flying
Limousines, big people, their parties
But I’m on an island
Watching through a window
The flashing light on the bed
Neon sign goes red
“You Are Here” it says
Well, at least someone knows where I am

Maybe I will get it wrong, no patience for myself
Selling years of ideas ‘til I’m old, a living on the shelf
I won’t follow I’m taking the long way, my standards hold me up
Why they eating they idols up now why they eating they idols up, damnit
I give ‘em my heart in words will they remember me
I’ll leave ‘em alone and time’ll want to smother what I say
I round another year and wonder did I go someplace
I’m bucking this one down, this one right here won’t walk away

We race the globe
The shakers and the fools
We trouble you know
You’ll find us were we fall, we chasing shadows
And I can’t have it, have it any other way
And I can’t have it, have it any other way
I’m not gon’ have it, have it any other way
And I can’t have it, have it any other way

No fear of flying

But I’m on an island
Watching through a window
The flashing light on the bed
Neon sign goes red
“You Are Here” it says
