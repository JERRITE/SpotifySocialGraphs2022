Novacaine Lyrics[Verse 1]
With dirt on your knees
And blood in your teeth
You want life to lead you to believe in something
But it's coming
Ah, ah, the numbing
So we dive on into the deeper end
For a blissful kiss from Judas' lips
But it's coming
Oh yeah, the numbing
[Chorus 1]
Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing

[Verse 2]
Analyzed and diagnosed
Overexposed to the undertow
You'll never know it's coming
Ah, ah, the numbing
So you meditate or medicate
To maintain or to get away
But it's coming
Oh yeah the numbing

[Chorus 1]
Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing

[Chorus 2]
Super novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
Living in a dream

[Chorus 1]
Super Novacaine
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing
Sleepwalking
(You're dead as dead can be)
You won't feel a thing1Embed
