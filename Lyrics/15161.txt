Wannabe in LA LyricsI came to L.A. to be rock and roll
Along the way I had to sell my soul
I made some good friends that make me say
I really wannabe in L.A

I took the time to get to Beverly
Laid some rocket tape roll on the 180
Alain and Natasha always make me say
I really wannabe in L.A

( I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)
( I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)
( I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)
I take the city in the dead of night
I'm burning gas until I feel all right
The sunset honeys always make me say
I really wannabe in L.A

I came to L.A. to be rock and roll
Along the way I had to sell my soul
I made some good friends that make me say
I really wannabe in L.AYou might also like2Embed
