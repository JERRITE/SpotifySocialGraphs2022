Come On Over (Turn Me On) LyricsLike a thief crawling through the night
Like a drunk brawling in a fight
How should I know what is right from wrong
Come on over, turn me on

Sunday best, you're my favourite suit
You make the team, you're no substitute
I know baby, I'm your favourite son, listen up babe
Come on over, turn me on

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
How we lay awake all night?
Is it any wonder
Hoping someday soon I see the light
Tell me baby, tell me pretty lies
See the spider been out catching flies
When you leave me I know it won't be long
Before you come on over, turn me on

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
How we lay awake all night?
Is it any wonder
Hoping someday soon I see the light

Like a blind man driving at the wheel
Like a hound dog scratching out a meal
You and I both know where you belong
Come on over, turn me onYou might also likeEmbed
