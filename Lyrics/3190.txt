Magic Spellz Lyrics[Verse 1: Monoxide]
What I feel lately is 50 shades of hate me
And I can't seem to break free
I don't like what I'm feelin' maybe
My self-medicating
At the point of breaking
I'm not sure if you're relating
I just need to feel like I'm the one worth saving

[Chorus: Madrox]
You lift me up in times when I wanna die
Intoxicated by your magic spells you weave all the time
You bring me down every time I feel alive
I'm trying, I'm living, I'm dying this minute
[Verse 2: Madrox]
You bring me up and take me down
Life smacks the face, I hold my ground
Another day to sing this song aloud
I wonder can they hear me screaming?

[Verse 3: Jared Gomes]
Switch it now, change the day
And take whatever comes my way, I gotta say
That this magical spell is Heaven or Hell when it plays
It can lighten or darken up your day,  push it away

[Chorus: Madrox]
You lift me up in times when I wanna die
Intoxicated by your magic spells you weave all the time
You bring me down every time I feel alive
I'm trying, I'm living, I'm dying this minute

[Interlude]
I try to live but they want me to cease to be
I'm shedding skin, cutting teeth, and becoming me

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Finger pointed, shaming, everybody blaming
What if I leave escaping, this I know, it'll be here waiting
Anticipating my downfall on the daily
But you give all that you gave me
And it saved me, and it saved me (And it saved me)
You might also like[Chorus: Madrox]
You lift me up in times when I wanna die
Intoxicated by your magic spells you weave all the time
You bring me down every time I feel alive
I'm trying, I'm living, I'm dying this minute
You lift me up in times when I wanna die
Intoxicated by your magic spells you weave all the time
You bring me down every time I feel alive
I'm trying, I'm living, I'm dying this minute1Embed
