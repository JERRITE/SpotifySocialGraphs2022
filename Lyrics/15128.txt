Man of Golden Words Lyrics[verse 1]
Wanna show you something like the joy inside my heart
Seems I've been living in the temple of the dog
Where would I live if I were a man of golden words?
And would I live at all?

[Chorus]
Words and music, my only tools
Communication

[verse 2]
And on her arrival, I will set free the birds
It's a pretty time of year when the mountains sing out loud
Tell me, Mr. Golden Words, how's about the world?
Tell me can you tell me at all, yeah
[Chorus]
Words and music, my only tools
Communication

[bridge]
Let's fall in love with music
The driving force of our livings
The only international language
Divine glory, the expression
The knees bow, the tongue confesses
The lord of lords, the king of kings
The king of kings, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Words and music, my only tools
Communication
Words and music, my only tools
