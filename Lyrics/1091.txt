TranslationsEspañolBefore I Lose My Mind (Stripped) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look at the state I'm in
I couldn’t say where I've been
Lord knows that it ain't felt like home
When you’re drinkin' the days away
They all kind of feel the same
It's a truth that I've had to face alone

[Chorus]
I don't know what
I've been running from, running from
Or what I thought I would find
All I know is
You're the only one, only one
I need you tonight
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
[Verse 2]
Your friends stuck around my eyes
How have I been so blind?
Don't tell me that I’m too late this time
So much I couldn’t see
With words that I didn't speak
What do I have to do to make you mine?

[Chorus]
Oh, I don’t know what
I've been running from, running from
Or what I thought I would find
All I know is
You're the only one, only one
I need you tonight
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know what
I’ve been running from, running from
Or what I thought I would find, oh
All I know is
That you're the only one, the only one
I need you tonight
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
Before I lose my mind
You might also like[Outro]
I don't know what
I've been running from, running from
I need you tonight2Embed
