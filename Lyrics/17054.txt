The Problem Song Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, this is my favourite song

[Verse 1]
I am not my name
I am not my job, I am not my fate
I am not my lover
But I love her
I am not okay, smiling through the pain
Life's a give and take
But we love like no other
Yeah, I love her
[Chorus]
Yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we need fixin'
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of patience
I put paper to pen and therapy said
"Maybe we can start again"
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know that we can fix them

[Verse 2]
So what we've got our problems
And sometimes, we hit rock bottom
'Til we cuss and cry and cuddle
It ain't perfect, but I love it, yeah
'Cause when I fall down, you're lifting me up (You're lifting me up)
Glass half empty, you're fillin' me up (Fillin' me up)
Can't feel high if you ain't been low
So I need to know that you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, guys, come get a look at this

[Chorus]
Yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we need fixin'
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of patience
I put paper to pen and therapy said
"Maybe we can start again"
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know that we can fix them
You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems
Yeah, we got, yeah, we got problems

[Chorus]
'Cause yeah, we got some problems
Baby, we're surviving
I know it's been a long road
And you're runnin' out of pavement
And baby, I put paper to pen and therapy said
"Maybe we can start again"
Yeah, we got problems, baby
But I know we can fix them

[Outro]
'Cause when I fall down, lifting me up
Glass half full, but she's filling me up
You can't get high if you ain't been high
Babe, I need to know that you know thatEmbed
