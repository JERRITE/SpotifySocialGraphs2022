Sound of Rain Lyrics[Chorus 1]
He think I don't want to tear it up
We came all night long, won't you let it up?
He think I won't want to tear it up
We lit on our own, won't you let it up?

[Chorus 2]
Let's go, nobody givin', addressing me
So nobody dress can effeminate me
Let's go, nobody taking a joke like me
So nobody dress can effeminate me
[Chorus 1]
He think I don't want to tear it up
We came all night long, won't you let it up?
He think I won't want to tear it up
We lit on our own, won't you let it up?

[Chorus 2]
Let's go, nobody givin', addressing me
So nobody dress can effeminate me
Let's go, nobody taking a joke like me
So nobody dress can effeminate me
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa)

[Outro]
Swangin' on them
Swangin' on them, swangin' on them, swangin' on them days
Swangin' on them days, swangin' on them days
Swangin' on them, swangin' on them, swangin' on my ways
Your girl, she go hard in the baste
Swangin' on them, swangin' on them, swangin' on my ways
Swangin' on my ways
Swangin' on my ways
I've been thinking like, "Ayy, yo"
And I've been thinking like, "Ayy, yo"
(Sound of rain helps me let go of the pain)
And I've been thinking like, "Ayy, yo"
(Sound of rain helps me let go of the pain)You might also like8Embed
