Follow My Feet Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a fork in the road in front of me
At the crossroads of identity
The Devil is standing to the left
He says "Either way, they both lead to death"

[Chorus]
And the high road's steady and steep
And the low road's easy and deep
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet
[Verse 2]
I have a friend who lies and steals and cheats
Always taking more than he can eat
He says "To get what I want, I would probably kill
If I don't take it, somebody else will"

[Chorus]
And the high road's steady and steep
And the low road's easy and deep
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet

[Bridge 1]
There is no time
Falling behind
Plant harmony
Or burn the tree

[Verse 3]
I have a friend who loves humanity
Braves bullets in war-torn countries
He traded a life of wealth to help the poor and ill
He says "If I don't do it, nobody will"

[Chorus]
And the high road's steady and steep
And the low road's easy and deep
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet
Guess I'll follow, follow, follow my feet

I don't know where
I don't know where
Where my path will lead, but I'll follow my feet and
Hopefully they'll keep me on the ground and I'll keep walking to the sound

[Outro]
Follow, follow, follow my feet
Follow, follow, follow your feet3Embed
