Gotta Do Something Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my friends got good-paying jobs
New families and dogs
House payments on a spot with a river view
I'm stuck fighting with my landlord
Asking me to pay more
This just ain't the look I want

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time
The pressure's on high
Show us what you got
The pity party's over now
[Chorus]
Well, you gotta do something
Wasting your life, just rolling the dice
Well, you gotta do something
Won't be young forever
Gotta get yourself together, you know

[Verse 2]
Borderline burnt out
Washed up, washed out
Feeling like I spent all my energy
Old age knocking at my doorway
Telling me to get paid
Tеlling me to knock it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you stand with me?

[Chorus]
Well, you gotta do somеthing
Wasting your life, just rolling the dice
Well, you gotta do something
Won't be young forever
Gotta get yourself together, you know

[Bridge]
I'm feeling lost, I'm feeling forsaken
Going to bed, going to bed achin'
I must be wrong, I must be mistaken
That's just the risk living at the heart of it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Won't be young forever
Gotta get yourself together

[Chorus]
Well, you gotta do something
Wasting your life, just rolling the dice
Well, you gotta do something
Won't be young forever
Gotta get yourself together, you know1Embed
