Sheâ€™s Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lovers having short careers
I wonder if they harbour fears
Of quickly gaining way too much
And slowly, slowly losing touch
Lovers having short careers
It's like they never use their ears
To listen to their beating chests
They pound like elevated nests

[Chorus]
In the wind (It's just water)
And the rain (It's just water)
It's just water (It's just water)
In the wind (It's just water)
And the rain (It's just water)
She's mine (It's just water)
[Verse 2]
Lovers hide amongst their peers
Their hearts leak blood like dropping tears
They beat themselves into a state
Confused and lost without a mate
Lovers hide amongst their peers
Yeah, the boos start drowning out the cheers
'Cause when you're fuckin' with your fate
You can't take "No" on the first date

[Chorus]
In the wind (It's just water)
And the rain (It's just water)
And it's just water (It's just water)
In the wind (It's just water)
And the rain (It's just water)
She's mine (It's just water)

[Outro]
It's just water
Taste it
I promise
It's just water
It's just water
Taste it
I promise
It's just water
It's just water
Taste it (It's just water)
I promise (It's just water)
It's just water
It's just water
Taste it (It's just water)
I promise (It's just water)
It's just waterYou might also likeEmbed
