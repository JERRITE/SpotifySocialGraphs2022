Missing the Mark Lyrics[Verse 1]
You came close biting your tongue
So don't look back the silence is done

[Chorus]
Just like a lighter, you need a spark
Sorry you're stuck here, here in the dark
You're comfort in giving in, always forgiving him
For missing the mark

[Verse 2]
And don't act tough, say what you need to
'Cause once upon a time you will find
It was you I believe in
[Chorus]
Just like a lighter, you need a spark
Sorry you're stuck here, here in the dark
You're comfort in giving in, always forgiving him
For missing the mark

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Just like a lighter, you need a spark
Sorry you're stuck here, here in the dark
You're comfort in giving in, always forgiving him
