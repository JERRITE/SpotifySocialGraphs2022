Favorite Liar Lyrics[Intro]
I remember going
Out to see the big rocks
Went without you knowing
Hope youâ€™re not too mad
I go a lot, I go a lot

[Verse 1]
I remember weekends
'fore we got too cool for them
And I remember thinking
Maybe we could just pretend tonight
For just tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna wake up feeling tired
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna lay there for a while

[Chorus]
But that don't change that you're a
Liar, a liar!
Hold yourself up higher and higher
I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar

[Verse 2]
I remember weekends
Fighting over everything
I can almost taste it
The bloody lip you left me with that night
Kiss me one last time

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna show you what it's like
I wanna be the one to show you what you're missing every night
Oh every night
You might also like[Chorus]
Too bad that you're a
Liar, a liar!
Hold yourself up higher and higher
I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar

[Bridge x2]
I've got room to grow
I know I'm missing home
But you think I'm alone
And I think you should know
That I've got pretty girls
Yeah, I've got pretty girls taking me home

[Pre-Chorus - Revised]
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna lay there for a while
I wanna wake up with you
I wanna wake up feel alive

[Chorus - Revised]
It's just too bad that you're a
Liar, a liar!
Cast me into your fire, your fire
'Cause I will never be less than what you want
I've got good news I'm heading off
To start a fire, a fire
Liar, a liar!
Hold yourself up higher and higher
I'm not buying the things you wanna say
I've heard 'em all now anyway
You're such a liar
My favorite liar
[Outro]
I remember waking up in Colorado
You said that it was raining
I tried to hide away, but you said no
You made me love the rain2Embed
