Intoxicated (Radio Edit) LyricsIntro:
Hi, what can I get you tonight?
Yeah, can I get a gimlet with extra vodka
Right on the way!
Here's your drink sir
Damn this drinks strong
But I like it...

Verse 1:
Speaker blasting all night long, the club got me up
Girls tryin' get my number
Ain't ever done somethin' like this before
So let's get this started
Pre-Chorus:
Hold up, I gotta take another drink
Don't mean no harm, this night on fleek

Chorus:
Feeling so drawn out, feel it go down in my mind
In my mind, in my mind. Going crazier every day
Still, I try, still, I try, still, I try to make you think that I'm not going crazy

Verse 2:
Another Gin & Tonic passed my way
Dang, how couldn't I drink it?
Bartender thinkin' I'm crazy
Hey, I'm not dеad yet!

She saying I'm not right
Girl, I'll prove you wrong
Givе me another shot
And I'll be up till tomorrow
Man ain't gonna back down now!

Pre-Chorus:
Hold up, I gotta take another drink
Don't mean no harm, this night on fleek

Chorus:
Feeling so drawn out, feel it go down in my mind
In my mind, in my mind. Going crazier every day
Still, I try, still, I try, still, I try to make you think I'm not going crazy

They all pick me up
I'm not ready the next night
Been drinking too much
But damn, I feel good (and I don't give two)

Chorus/Ending:
Feeling so drawn out, feel it go down in my mind
In my mind, in my mind. Going crazier every day
Still, I try, still, I try, still, I try to make you think I'm not going crazy
Feeling so drawn out, feel it go down in my mind
In my mind, in my mind. Going crazier every day
Still, I try, still, I try, still, I try to make you think I'm not going crazyEmbed
