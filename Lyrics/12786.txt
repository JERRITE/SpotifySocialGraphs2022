Change for You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Twenty-two and oh lord, I'm seeing red
I bought a gun last night 'cause god, I'm afraid of death

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I never say no
Never stay home
Never wanna stop
But I don't wanna go
(Mmm)
[Chorus]
Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away
(Mmm)
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you

[Verse 2]
Too late for me to come around
Oh, and I'm so fucked up
And everybody's bringing me down
Oh, is it all about me?
All the money
All about always wanting more
(Mmm)
Always want more, more

[Chorus]
Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away
(Oh)
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you

Out of sorts and oh lord
We're turning blue
But we found a strange way
Of saying the same thing
With nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh and we never say no
Never stay home
Never wanna stop
But we don't wanna go
(Mmm)

[Chorus]
Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away
(Oh)
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for youEmbed
