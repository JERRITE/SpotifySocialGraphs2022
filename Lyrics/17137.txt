Trickin Ass Nigga Lyrics[Intro: Blac Youngsta & Moneybagg Yo]
Let's go (I got Hitman on the beat)
This a hit, fool, no cap (Okay)
Blac Youngsta on the track
Bagg too, Bagg too, yeah, yeah
Okay, you know I’m back on that bullshit, right?
Bitch, come on (Go)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Trickin'-ass nigga, that's somethin’ I would never be (Nah)
I won't buy you nothin' you can't afford yourself fuckin' with me (No, ma'am)
Bitch, I'm status which means just to be in my presence is a fee (Goddamn)
Booty tatted, she call me daddy like I'm old enough to be (Go H.A.M.)
2020 Urus for my bitch, now she got Lambo pussy
Turn up on ’em, told her make ’em madder 'cause I know they lookin’ (Now)
You can see it from the back (Back)
Thought I saw her puddy cat (Tweetie)
Don't call her a ho, she just a product of her habitat
Askin' for somethin' and don’t belong to me, bitch, it's over with (It's ovеr with)
Runnin' 'round mentionin' what we doin', so she blowеd it (Blowed it)
I fuck with Apple, he walked straight up in the door and poured two lines (Clean)
I had left that bitch last week, why I look up and she still cryin'? (Huh?)
Got nothin' for no bitch but mine, if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'
[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Trickin'-ass nigga (Whore), he up to no good
He said he gon' make her problems go away, take her out the hood
He said he gon' pull down on me 'bout that bitch, I wish he would
I said I'm gon' bust my fire just like I did back in the hood (Gang gang)
Trickin'-ass nigga (Whore), yeah, your pockets full
Can't be standin' in the shake zone not throwin' money, that ain't good
He said he gon' pull down on you, throw them racks, but he don't do it
I said I'm gon' pull down on you, give you dick like Tiger Woods (Whore)

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
I said I still be in the club throwin' gang signs (Gang gang)
You live in your house, ho, I'm gon' live in mines (My shit)
You want me to rush, ho, I'm gon' take my time (Woo)
Rolex on my wrist, but I can't tell the time
She gon' deepthroat (Deep)
Ass and her waist match her face, she a freak ho (Freak)
You know all my bitches, they do anything for a B-roll (Streets)
You know all my niggas, they do anything for a C-note (Creep)
I don't care if you know long as the streets know (You a)

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
Trickin'-ass nigga (Gang gang), he up to no good
He said he gon' make her problems go away, take her out the hood
He said he gon' pull down on me 'bout that bitch, I wish he would
I said I'm gon' bust my fire just like I did back in the hood (Gang gang)
Trickin'-ass nigga (Gang gang), yeah, your pockets full
Can't be standin' in the shake zone not throwin' money, that ain't good
He said he gon' pull down on you, throw them racks, but he don't do it
I said I'm gon' pull down on you, give you dick like Tiger Woods (Whore)
