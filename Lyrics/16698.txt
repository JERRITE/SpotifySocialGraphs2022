Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) Lyrics[Verse 1: Rose Stone]
When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, what will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?
Here's what she said to me

[Chorus]
Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Well well well
Que Sera, Que Sera, Que Sera
[Verse 2: Rose Stone]
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover, what will I be?
Will I be rich day after day? (Sing, Rose)
Here's how my lover said

[Chorus]
Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
Oh oh, the future's not ours to see
Que Sera, Que Sera, Que Sera

Que Sera, Sera
Whatever will be, will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera, Que Sera, Que Sera

[Verse 3: Rose Stone]
Now I have children (well) of my own
They asked their mother, What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?
I tell them... (well, well, well, well)

[Chorus]
Que Sera, Sera
Que Sera, Sera
