Drop An Album Lyrics[Intro]
Where we at?
Blockworks
Concrete Evidence, 227

[Verse 1]
Bojack off the Richter, got the whole ghetto earthquakin'
Call my cousin Clifford, tryna find out what them birds takin'
Took a Merton Hanks and stomped on it, did the Kirk Franklin
That was me out there on Hell Block and Curtis, curb-crankin'
Sometimes I wish a nigga was makin' this shit up
Still that same nigga, left the hood blanketed in dust
Heated thermal when it's not warm, formal dress attire
Keep them kernels of the popcorn, Orville Redenbacher
Beef еternal with my demons, I do more than еxorcise 'em
Watch how you run up on this foreign 'fore you catch a hot one
On Brick Mile, I got the title, we be stockpilin'
Clips as round as a vinyl, don't make me drop a album
Shoutout to Theodore and Simon, shit, but I was Alvin
Pressin' on consignment, I could never be McDonald's Calvin
These niggas Ronald McDonald, I'm more Donald Goines
Gatherin' pennies for my thoughts from all the phrases I done coined
It's Blocks
[Interlude: Sample]
Everyone I saw swore they knew me, once upon—
Everyone I saw swore they knew me, once upon— ([?])
Everyone I saw swore they knew me, once upon a song
Main—

[Verse 2]
Pots and pans, rocks in hand
Lil' niggas choppin' grams
Due to his gang relationships, why his time got enhanced
Poppin' xans, rockin' Vans; never stood a fighting chance
Kidnapped the gang, held it for ransom, now he got demands
Every time we saw the cops, we ran
Heard them shots, we scram
Had 'em bangin' needles, coppin' yams, turned them knots to bands
Niggas wasn't with us takin' trips when we shot them jams
Allie keep tellin' me same shit that J-Roc been sayin'
How I get picked out the lineup? He never got a glance
Heard that nigga told on lil' bro, can't even rock with fam
All I rock is Cartiers, got bitches thinkin' I'm from France
I'm from Belvedere, but my bludda, 'e from Nottingham
Hoppin' out the Lamb, hard to tell the difference from opps and fans
Niggas never stuck to the script, must've forgot the plan
Body slam a brick in Flint water, fresh out of the can
Disrespect the gang, we gon' send 'em to the promised land
What else?
