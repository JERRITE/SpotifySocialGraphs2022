​i’m sorry if i hurt u sometimes Lyrics[Verse 1]
You made sure that I was caught in your hair
Got tied up in your issues, I tried to repair
I only make it easy 'cause I really care
And you're always so stressed out, I wanna be there
But nothing's ever going the way that you planned
I'm beginning to believe that's out of my hands
And there's a type of people who'll never be happy
And I'm starting to think that you fit in there nicely

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna wait
Wanna mess it up this late
'Cause I don't think we'll get it back
I wake up еvery day
Second guessing what wе've made
'Cause I just want my life back
[Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I hurt you sometimes
Crossed the line before the bridge and now it's burning slow
Never got to be what we had in mind
Tried so hard to see the good but I just wanna go
Yeah, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
You're not hard to love, you're just not meant to be mine

[Verse 2]
I was really stubborn, so unprepared
We always fit so nicely so I wouldn't dare
Admit I wasn't happy 'cause I really care
And you're always so stressed out, I wanna be there

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna wait
Wanna mess it up this late
'Cause I don't think we'll get it back
I wake up every day
Second guessing what we've made
'Cause I just want my life back

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I hurt you sometimes
Crossed the line before the bridge and now it's burning slow
Never got to be what we had in mind
Tried so hard to see the good but I just wanna go
Yeah, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
You're not hard to love, you're just not meant to be mine
You might also like[Bridge]
Had myself convinced that you were the one
Spent four years falling harder and I finally got up
We had nothing else in common but we wanna be loved
And it wasn't enough

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I hurt you sometimes
Crossed the line before the bridge and now it's burning slow
Never got to be what we had in mind
Tried so hard to see the good but I just wanna go
Yeah, I'm sorry if I hurt you sometimes
Crossed the line before the bridge and now it's burning slow
Never got to be what we had in mind
Tried so hard to see the good but I just wanna go
Yeah, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
You're not hard to love, you're just not meant to be mine
Yeah, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
You're not hard to love, you're just not meant to be mineEmbed
