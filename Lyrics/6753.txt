Akina Speed Star Lyrics[Intro]
"When you first push in the clutch
That's the moment
That's when you really notice it
Just how different it feels"
Huh?
Unreal!
Whoa!
It's like having gold!
"Told you you'd be impressed, didn't I?"
"No, it goes way beyond that
This blows me away
How'd you manage to get a hold of something like this?
I just can't believe you got this for the 86!
That's amazing!"
"Yeah, me either
I haven't felt this excited in a while..."
[Verse: Xavier Wulf]
You can leave it up to me to never fail or cease to switch it up
I'm still smoking plenty blunts
Some say it's too many blunts
Don't catch me out here eatin' lunchs then after that gon' see me hunt
Pull up S13 and pop my hood and let my trunk thump
Ridin' through the hood I bump the thump from trunk will shake you up
Pull up to the party sparked
Your girl see me and save a spot
She know, I know what I want
She wondering if she the one
But I ain't gon' start nothing
My energy is for the hustle
She say she can deal with that
But she still want it from the back
I might slide that wacky pack like Sonic then be out of that
Pull up smoking jumpin' jacks
The smell of that would lay you back
She drink just like Lahey but I'm Ricky when I smoke a sack
Pull off with them handles man
2 40 slide up to the pack
K-A no SR, you bitch
Watch how I make these niggas mad
He pull off he looking sad
Switch back to me I fill my glass
Clowns canâ€™t get down with us, no rappers can come damage us
He come with that tricky shit
We quick and first to handle it
I can't give a fuck for shit
It's Hollowsquad or nothing you bitch
Who nigga

"It almost seems to good to waste on a kid like Takami, doesn't it?"
"Well... when are you gonna put it in there?"
"We'll see, a better engine isn't automatically gonna make the car a better machine"18Embed
