Promise This Lyrics[Intro]
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Plumerai les ailes

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And you came in, turned the lights on
And created what it's came to be
Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please, spread your wings, cover me and
[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake, oh
Promise this, take your time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

[Post-Chorus]
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Déployer les ailes
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Alouette-uette-uette
Plumerai les ailes

[Verse 2]
Though I'm walking through the shadows
You are with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now, time for sleeping
But before that, would you restore me?
Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please, spread your wings (Your wings, yeah), cover me and

[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake, oh (If I die)
Promise this, take your time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

[Bridge]
By a thread, we're hanging on (Hanging on)
And I hope you don't let go (Don't let go)
If you ever leave me, know I wanna go with you

[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake, oh (Promise this, yeah)
Promise this, take your time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips
