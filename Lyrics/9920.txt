Danny Devito Lyrics[Intro]
Don't snort a line, smoke a kilo, after that cash like casino
And this a wrap like burrito, It's rest in peace, Don 'Vito
Bitch I'm—

[Chorus]
Ayy!
Stick to the back on the low, I move
Sick with the raps, but no achoo
Who want smoke with the whole damn crew?
I do, I do, I do, I do
Wrist don’t crack, but it's froze like ooh
Comin' for yo neck like, "Pew pew pew"
Who want smoke with the whole damn crew?
I do, I do, I do, I do
[Refrain]
No such thing as friends, I promise that they don't exist (They don't exist)
I got shooters lurkin', choppa might blow you a kiss (Might blow a kiss)
Yellow shorts on me, I'm lookin' like I took a piss (Like I took a piss)
How I pull up and shorty still wanna have my kids? (Have my fuckin' kids!)

[Verse 1]
I just might fuck around and get abducted
Yo bitch, she a thot, and she look like a Muppet
My dick, she could suck it, got bread like a muffin
I'm back on my bullshit, to me, it is nothing
Rap game, Mike Tyson
All it took was one hit
Shorty like how I'm stuntin'
She gon' suck on my dick yeah

[Refrain]
No such thing as friends, I promise that they don't exist (They don't exist)
I got shooters lurkin', choppa might blow you a kiss (Might blow a kiss)
Yellow shorts on me, I'm lookin' like I took a piss (Like I took a piss)
How I pull up and shorty still wanna have my kids? (Have my fuckin' kids!)

[Verse 3]
I’m too drunk to walk, I'll drive
Where my funds, bitch? It's on sight
Fuck that ho, now she my wife
I'm doin' blow like every night (Yeah!)
I’m too drunk to walk, I'll drive
Where my funds, bitch? It's on sight
Fuck that ho, now she my wife
I'm doin' blow like every night (BITCH!)

Stick to the back on the low, I move
Sick with the raps, but no achoo
Who want smoke with the whole damn crew?
I do, I do, I do, I do
Wrist don’t crack, but it's froze like ooh
Comin' for yo neck like, "Pew pew pew"
Who want smoke with the whole damn crew?
I do, I do, I do, I do

[Bridge: Danny DeVito]
I occupy my mind, immersing myself in the culture, taking in the cuisine
But mostly doing cocaine!

[Verse 3]
I feel like Danny DeVito, but still look good in a speedo
Pull up like, "Que pasa mijo?" She suck my dick like a Cheeto
Don’t snort a line, snort a kilo, after that cash like casino
And this a wrap like burrito, It’s rest in piece Don Vito
Bitch, I'm top ten like WatchMojo
Hating on me, you a bozo (Bozo)
Don’t want no smoke like the ozone (Ozone)
Iced out feeling like Frozone
Bitch, I'm top ten like WatchMojo
Hating on me, you a bozo (Bozo)
Don’t want no smoke like the ozone (Ozone)
Iced out feeling like Frozone
Bitch, I'm top ten like WatchMojo
Hating on me, you a bozo (Bozo)
Don’t want no smoke like the ozone (Ozone)
Iced out feeling like Frozone
Bitch, I'm—1Embed
