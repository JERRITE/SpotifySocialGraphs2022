Who Said Anything (About Falling in Love)? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know why you love me like you do
It's not like I'm special, special like you
Open your eyes, she's just been reading lines
But she's ever so convincing, want to believe her this time

[Chorus]
Who said anything about falling in love?
Lost my mind when I surrendered
Everything to find you're in love
This is my mistake
'Cause who said anything about falling in love?
In love, in love
[Verse 2]
Someone like you was made to be enjoyed (Made to be enjoyed)
But it won't be by me and that leaves me terrified
I'm coming to terms, I know it didn't mean a thing to you, didn't mean a thing but it
Meant quite a lot to me, meant too much I can see (I can see)

[Chorus]
Who said anything about falling in love?
Lost my mind when I surrendered
Everything to find you're in love
This is my mistake
'Cause who said anything about falling in love?
In love, in love

[Bridge]
I know, I know
That you're just being kind, but it's giving me a false hope
I know, I know
That I only need a little, just a little bit of false hope
I know, I know
That I'm only seeing what I, what I want

[Chorus]
Who said anything about falling in love?
Lost my mind when I surrendered
Everything to find you're in love
This is my mistake
'Cause who said anything about falling in love?
Lost my mind when I surrendered
Everything to find you're in love
This is my mistake
'Cause who said anything about falling in love?
Lost my mind when I surrendered
Everything to find you're in love
This is my mistake

Who said anything about falling in love? (In love, in love?)
This is my mistake
Who said anything about falling in love?Embed
