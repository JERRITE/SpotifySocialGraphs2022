80/20 Lyrics[Verse 1: Chloe]
I'm going crazy when I see you walking past, look at that
Looking, looking like a snack, look at that
And you, you stare me down, love my fair wicked eyes
And you tell me what to do, when I can't keep my eyes off you

[Pre-Chorus: Chloe with Halle]
He's conventional, you're mystical
I'm criminal, but it's spiritual
I cannot fight off a burning desire
That's what I getting for playing with fire
The fire
[Chorus: Halle]
I got that eighty-twenty, know I got that eighty-twenty
I get that eighty from my baby, and it's good for me
But I want that twenty-twenty, thinking 'bout that twenty-twenty
I get that eighty from my baby, do it, do it for me (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Chloe]
When you fight it, all that temptation
'Cause I'm so excited, but so indecisive, nah
Wanna dive in, with no hesitation
I got limitations, wish I could taste it now

[Pre-Chorus: Chloe]
He's conventional, you're mystical (Oh, oh)
I'm criminal, but it's spiritual (Oh, oh)
I cannot fight off a burning desire (Oh, oh)
That's what I getting for playing with fire
With fire

[Chorus: Halle]
I got that eighty-twenty, know I got that eighty-twenty
I get that eighty from my baby, and it's good for me
But I want that twenty-twenty, thinking 'bout that twenty-twenty
I get that eighty from my baby, do it, do it for me (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus: Halle]
Oh, oh (Fire)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Fire)
Oh, oh, oh (Fire)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Fire, yeah)
