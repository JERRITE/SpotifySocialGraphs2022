TranslationsTiếng ViệtTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsItalianoDeutschLonely People Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm an island, I'm alone, but I'm alive
Candy apple, I went home without a prize
They're all laughing, keep on laughing, so am I
I'm an island, I'm alone, but I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Crying doesn't make you charming
Only thing I'm not is sorry
Dancing at a pity party, at a pity party
[Chorus]
Guess we're all lonely people
Guess we're all lonely people
Romeo has no sequel
Guess we're all lonely people

[Verse 2]
All that love is, is a means to an end
I'm always finding broken hearts instead
All that love is, is a means to an end
Romeo and Juliet are dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Crying doesn't make you charming
Only thing I'm not is sorry
Dancing at a pity party, at a pity party

[Chorus]
Guess we're all lonely people
Guess we're all lonely people
Romeo has no sequel
Guess we're all lonely people
Guess we're all lonely people
Guess we're all lonely people
Romeo has no sequel
Guess we're all lonely people
