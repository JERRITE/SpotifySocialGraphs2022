These Boots Are Made For Walking Lyrics[Intro]
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'

[Verse 1]
You keep saying you've got something for me
Something you call love but confess
You've been messin' where you shouldn't've been a'messin'
And now someone else is getting all your best

[Pre-Chorus]
These boots are made for walking and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[Chorus]
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin')
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin')
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin', start walkin', start walkin')

[Verse 2]
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, uh
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain't have time to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
These boots are made for walking and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Chorus]
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin')
You ready, boots?
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin')
Start walkin'
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin' (Start walkin', start walkin')
