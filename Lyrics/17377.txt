Ok Ok Ok Lyrics[Intro: Lil Durk]
808 my crew
Yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Put this shit on and I fuck it up, ayy
I put you on, you can't fuck it up, ayy
I’m on the run if I catch me a case
That bitch broke, I spit in her face
One pair of jeans cost me 2K
Go the solo lane 'cause I don't go on no dates
Bring me the pills and I land in the A
All of my diamonds gon’ jump out the face
Back to the street shit, street shit, ayy
Headshot, sneak diss, sneak diss, ayy
That four-five got a kick, okay?
Want Chanel? Suck dick, okay?
You in Chiraq but you be in the way
I catch niggas tryna ride my wave
Know a nigga left, but he wished he stayed
30K for a show, I hit that stage
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Bitch I don't pay for no lashes, ayy
Bitch gotta wait on her taxes, ayy
X pills, we don't like acid, ayy
That's okay
[Verse 2: Booka600]
Bitch wanna lay up, she get slayed
Amiri jeans hang off my waist
Walk in on a bitch, lil' bitch, she bae
Snort a lil' coke, lil' bitch, she brave
Glock with a switch, it touch your fade
Last bitch gave me head was laced
So she can't tell me she late
Twenty on a chain, that shit look brazy

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Ayy
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay

[Verse 3: King Von]
Give her Plan B, I planned it, uh
Pull up right now, no panics, uh
Opps say, "King Von, can’t stand him," what?
Body count so ugly, still handsome, uh
Don’t bop my chain, we dancin', uh
Won’t talk, my niggas be blastin', uh
Walked in, spent twenty in fashion, what?
How the fuck I make it in rappin'? Uh
Don't know you, boy, you cappin’, uh
The opps outside, they lackin', what?
Steve, where you at? I need traffic, huh
50K stuffed in my mattress, uh
Ever see a nigga do a backflip? Uh
Don't want to, duck when this MAC spit, uh
Semis and glizzys (Huh?)
19 with the fifties (What? Huh?)
Hellcat with the hemis (Huh? Huh?)
Ain't go to sleep, we at Denny's, uh
I got a problem, don't tempt me (What?)
Won't stop 'til the Glock is empty, ayy
