Lovinâ€™ Each Day Lyrics[Intro]
Ah c'mon yeah
Ah c'mon yeah

[Chorus]
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Please baby
I need you here

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm on a mission
To cure my condition
'Cause without your kissin'
My heart's just a prison
So I'm hopin' and wishin'
That girl I'm forgiven
Say yeah - yeah yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you leave me
I'm sad
The moment you're returning
I'm glad
So let's not go forgetting what we had
'Cause it's bad, so damn bad

[Chorus]
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh, baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please, baby, I need you here

[Verse 2]
If I've hurt your feelings
Then, baby, we're even
'Cause I've been greivin'
Since you said you're leavin'
But now you're by my side
Let's not fight
'Cause you're right

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I lose you
I'm lost
The more you versus me girl
There's just us
'Cause anything without you's just a bust
Baby trust, you're a must (yeah yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh, baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please, baby, I need you here

[Bridge]
So don't go throwing our love away
It's here to stay
I'm telling you
There's nothing that can stop us anyway
Our love's an ocean
Let's get it in motion

[Chorus]
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh, baby, I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please, baby, I need you here
I need you here
I need you here
I need you here
I need you here
'Cause we're lovin' and we're givin'
And we're hopin' and we're dreamin'
Lovin' and we're givin'
And we're hopin' and we're dreamin'
Oh, baby, I need you hereEmbed
