Champagne Showers Lyrics[Chorus: LMFAO & Natalia Kills]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
(Are you ready for it?)
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop-pop-pop-pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour
(Let the party rock!)
[Verse 1: Redfoo w/ Natalia Kills]
Put your hands up
Everybody just dance up
We came to party rock
So flash your titties like Mardi Gras (Ha!)
They call me Redfoo
I walk in the club with a bottle or two
Shake it, spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & Natalia Kills]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Won't forget- no!

[Chorus: LMFAO & Natalia Kills]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
(Are you ready for it?)
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop-pop-pop-pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour
Let the party rock!

Boom!
Guess who stepped in the room
SkyBlu, Redfoo and Goon
He's a party rocker from night 'til noon
And it's about to be a champagne monsoon
Baby girl, you look legit
Come to my table and take a sip
Open wide cause we're spraying it
Fifty six bottles ain't paid for shit

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & Natalia Kills]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Won't forget- no!

[Chorus: LMFAO & Natalia Kills]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
(Are you ready for it?)
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop-pop-pop-pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour
[Bridge 2: Redfoo]
Party people
Now I want you to grab your bottles
Put them up in the air
Now shake, shake, shake that bottle and make it [pop]

[Outro: Natalia Kills]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Oh

Oh
