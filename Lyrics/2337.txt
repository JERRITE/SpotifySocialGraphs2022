​all ur fault LyricsGirl, this is all your fault
How did we get here?
I wish that we could talk, yeah
But you just disappear
Girl, this is all your fault
I never should have stayed
I thought that you would change
But you just ran away
Tell me how that feels

Girl, this is all your fault
Girl, this is all your fault
I thought you would change, I was wrong
People never change, just move on
But we both made mistakes
Been learning from our ways
And you just can't relate
Give it up
All I heard is that you've been picking up
Damn, I used to be so into you
Someone tell me what the difference was
Maybe I just didn't give еnough
Maybe you just didn't give a fuck
How was I evеr that into you?

Girl, this is all your fault
How did we get here?
I wish that we could talk, yeah
But you just disappear
Girl, this is all your fault
I never should have stayed
I thought that you would change
But you just ran away
Tell me how that feels

Girl, this is all your fault
Girl, this is all your fault
Girl, this is all your fault
