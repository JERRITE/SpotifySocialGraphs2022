Wild Game Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can feel you're blue
What's on your mind is so see-through
Should I stay? Oh, let me know (Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
It's up to you, you're in control (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Got a couple friends around (Oh, yeah, oh yeah)
Let's play a wild game, let's play a wild game
Got a couple friends around (Around)
Let's play it my way, let's play it my way
[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Heartbeats racing
Got a little nasty
I think I like how you taste (Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
I think I like how you taste (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Got a couple friends around (Oh, yeah, oh yeah)
Let's play a wild game, let's play a wild game
Got a couple friends around (Around)
Let's play it my way, let's play it my way
Got a couple friends around (Oh, yeah)
Let's play a wild game, let's play a wild game
Got a couple friends around (Around)
Let's play it my way, let's play it my way

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Got a couple friends around (Around)
Let's play a wild game, let's play a wild game
Got a couple friends around (Around)
Let's play a wild game, let's play a wild game
