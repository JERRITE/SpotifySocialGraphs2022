Gave It to ‘Em Lyrics[Intro: Styles P]
I don't even wanna fuckin' talk to these niggas (Yeah)
Let's just show 'em (Yeah)
You know? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I see dead rappers to dead the night
To get it a Cyphe
Ghost shit, that's why I never write
Buy time, not get a refund nigga (No refunds)
You could make a movie, and not get a rerun nigga
You could make a scene, and I make a buck
My stilo is to treat 'em like a kilo, cut 'em or tape 'em up
I ain't the killer type, I'm the villa type
Black Tuxedo in the Porsche, that's vanilla white
I can't even pillow fight, guns in the pillow case
Trying to count the old bills, the shit got the lil' face (Yeah)
Start with a lil' weight, start with a couple rounds
Did the shit once, I could do it a couple times
Aww man, my nigga look at me now (Look at me)
It's a show, not year when they booking me now (You know)
Wolf King, fuck around get you put in the ground (Fuck around)
We the best out, it's no need for looking around (L-O-X)
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Two hundred on the dashboard, so I gave it to 'em
Then he had the nerve to ask for it, so I gave it to 'em
You ain't gotta talk behind his back, you should say it to 'em
Then he try to pull up where I'm at, so I gave it to 'em
They wanted the L-O-X shit, so I gave it to 'em (LOX)
Strippers wanted money in the club, so I gave it to 'em
Homie wanted fifty from the plug, so I gave it to 'em (Ayo, talk that shit 'Kiss)
All my niggas needed was some love, so I gave it to 'em

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Big man with the muscles acting hard, put the razor to 'em
Silverback, brains on the wall, I gorilla glue 'em (Uh)
Cross anyone of my niggas, I don't care how you do 'em (LOX)
Send his cold body bag home, I don't care how you flew 'em (Woo)
Brother, cousin, use to work with 'em, I don't care how you knew 'em (Nah)
Send my main bitch to go fuck 'em, I don't care how she screw 'em (Woo)
Plant based, vegan, or beef I don't care how you chew 'em (Get it)
LOX got too many fuckin hits, it's hard to brew 'em
Been underrated, but the streets they gotta Suu Woop 'em
I'm like 'Thank you cuz" (Thank you cuz), just because (Ayy)
Fame and money bring jealousy, that's what it does
Niggas lie on IG, just to get a buzz
Son want his college paid off, so I gave to 'em
Sent my nigga money in jail, it just made it to 'em
Cross me, suck my dick, if you related to 'em (Haha)
And when I'm dead and gone, just be glad you knew 'em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
His first time seeing some profit, it was amazing to 'em (Amazing)
Nah he want one of my watches, so I gave it to 'em (Gave it, take that)
You just keep the gun in your pocket, that's good behavior to 'em (Uh)
He ain't even gotta repay me, that's just a favor to 'em (Woo)
Reason that they worship the God, I'm like a savior to 'em (Haha)
Sometimes I give it to em harsh, at least I gave it to 'em (Yeah)
Told my man they in the air, then they made it to 'em (Touchdown)
Dance with devil one time, now I'm related to 'em
From the dirt, to the muddy water, yeah I made it through 'em (Yeah)
Couple flicks, couple money orders, so I gave it to 'em (LOX)
Mom dukes, wifey, and my daughters, try to cater to 'em (Uh)
Soon as them things cross the border, yeah I gave it to 'em
You already know, cop and go, that's how Jada do 'em (You know)
Look him in his eye, be a man about it, say it to him
Then again, you'll probably do it how a hater do 'em (Yeah)
Silencer is ten years, I put the potato to 'em (Woo)
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Two hundred on the dashboard, so I gave it to 'em (What? What?)
Then he had the nerve to ask for it, so I gave it to 'em

Then he try to pull up where I'm at, so I gave it to 'em
They wanted the L-O-X shit, so I gave it to 'em
Strippers wanted money in the club, so I gave it to 'em
Homie wanted fifty from the plug, so I gave it to 'em

So I gave it to 'em

You should say it to 'em
So I gave it to 'em (Yeah)Embed
