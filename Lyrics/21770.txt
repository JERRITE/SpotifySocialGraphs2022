Midnight Lorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
I walk down the road looking for my tribunal
Like Tom and Huck stumbling down the aisle of their own funeral
Please goddess of the road, get me on my way
You see my love just left me so I’m on my own
And my heart’s banged up looking for a foster home
The highway moon is getting me dizzy
I see a mirage of medusa
A top of an Appaloosa
What I wouldn’t do to be with you and your caboosa
Whispering to Mr. Beck now who’s the real loser
[Chorus]
Here come again the midnight Lorry
I think I might be moving along
There’s a lot of places I got to get to
I know you’re out there but I never even met you
Take me to the land of no worry and then I‘ll just keep playing this song
Mr. Driver I hear the music playin’ and I see the lights
Will you throw me a ride?

[Verse 2]
A pretty young thing ushers me back to the rear
I haven’t been many places and I definitely haven’t been here
To think I was just a lonely soul in the cold with my thumb out
Now I’m rolling a smoke and being told to stick my tongue out
We bounced and blared and so did the Lorry
She teased my hair and held me close with a story
Of ragtag visions as the moonlight poured in
Second star to the right and straight on til’ morning

[Chorus]
Here come again the midnight Lorry
I think I might be moving along
There’s a lot of places I got to get to
I know you’re out there but I never even met you
Take me to the land of no worry and then I‘ll just keep playing this song
Mr. Driver I hear the music playin’ and I see the lights
Will you throw me a ride?
You might also like[Bridge]
Looking at her face was like looking at the sun
She said you can’t ask of everybody what you don’t ask of one
Either way, we got today and that’s all we may be allowed
I know that if we hold it together
There’s real love we can bring about

[Chorus]
Here come again the midnight Lorry
I think I might be moving along
There’s a lot of places I got to get to
I know you’re out there but I never even met you
Take me to the land of no worry and then I’ll just keep playing this song
Mr. Driver I hear the music playing and I see the lights
Will you throw me a ride?

[Interlude]
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes

[Chorus]
Here come again the midnight Lorry
I think I might be moving along
There’s a lot of places I got to get to
I know you’re out there but I never even met you
Take me to the land of no worry and then I’ll just keep playing this song
Mr. Driver I hear the music playing and I see the lights
Will you throw me a ride?
[Outro]
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes
Here comes
Here comesEmbed
