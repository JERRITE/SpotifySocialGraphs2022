Out Of This Town Lyrics[Intro]
All I know, that's for sure
Is that I don't know at all
Throw your phone on the floor
You only need it when I call

[Verse 1]
I'm always throwing down for the whole squad
Never going my back to my old job
Flying in a jet, going off to Mars
Trying to see the world through different cars
And sweat tears, different years
I knew I was made for this
Tonight I just take a sip
I guess this is what famous is
[Chorus]
I've been on my last, I've been down for the count
I've been climbing to the top, I've been all the way down
Just put your hands on my hands, let's get out of this crowd
I wanna dance, wanna dance, my way out of this town (all I know)
I've been on my last, I've been down for the count
I've been climbing to the top, I've been all the way down
Just put your hands on my hands, let's get out of this crowd
I wanna dance, wanna dance, my way out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through

[Drop]
Get your, get your hands up!
Let's go

[Bridge]
All I know
That I don't know
If you want me
Girl it don't show
Push up on me
On the dance floor
You don't love me
Grab my hand tho
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been on my last, I've been down for the count
I've been climbing to the top, I've been all the way down
Just put your hands on my hands, let's get out of this crowd
I wanna dance, wanna dance, my way out of this town (all I know)
I've been on my last, I've been down for the count
I've been climbing to the top, I've been all the way down
Just put your hands on my hands, let's get out of this crowd
I wanna dance, wanna dance, my way out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through
I've been on one, I've been on two
Hands in the air, when I come through

[Drop]
Get your, get your hands up!
Let's go1Embed
