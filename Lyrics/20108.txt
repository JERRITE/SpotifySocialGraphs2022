Autumn Collection Lyrics[Chorus 1]
I slide on through
I'm always floatin'
I glide on through
I'm always floatin'
Poor boy, you come through, I'll always be
Floating on, don't want this
Rich boy, chin check, I'll always be
Acting out, on my shit

[Verse 1]
If it's just for one night
Would you call me back?
Up in a bitch, her eyes rolling back
Shakin' her legs and I’m calling that
Caught me all by surprise, start to feel attached
Numbin' the veins and I’m new to that
Calling my bluff and my lips all chapped, that's that
And I'm all right
Hand me the leaf and I'll pulverize
Feel my lungs so tight
Sweat on my brow and I’m cold as ice
And I don’t play nice, till the price is right
Forget what they taught you, I'll teach you right
Now change your fucking name
I'll bet you'll fade
[Chorus 2]
I slide on through
I'm always floatin'
I glide on through
I'm always floatin'
It’s been so long
My life's been gone
What games you playing?
I float on, sailin'

[Verse 2]
It's been the same, you're just a name
A butterfly gliding, will cut you with pace
Order a star, sip on a heart
Walk out the door and I leave with my mask
Cover my pain with thunder and rain
Your vengeance is coming but I'll never change
It's been done and said, just leave me the red
Drinkin' the pain and forget what you said

[Chorus 3]
I slide on through
I'm always floatin'
I glide on through
I'm always floatin'
I slide on through
I'm always floatin'
I glide on through
I'm always floatin'You might also like18Embed
