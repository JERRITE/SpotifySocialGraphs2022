Back in My Arms Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, I can't control this
Heighten my emotions
You can make me feel brand new
Distance hard to cope with
Find someone to smoke with
'Cause nothing really feels like you

[Pre-Chorus]
All we have is on the phone
All we have is all I know
When you hang up, don't let go
Don't let go
[Chorus]
This the kind of love they say is wrong
This what I been waiting for so long
Feel you on my body when you're gone
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms like
Back when we were laying on your floor
Hoping no one opens up the door
Feel you on my body wanting more
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms

[Verse 2]
Saw you in that red dress
Doing so much damage
Fuck me up, no, I don't mind (Don't mind)
You're something that I can't forget
Like inhaling a cigarette
Hit me and it's so divine

[Pre-Chorus]
All we have is on the phone
All we have is all I know
When you hang up, don't let go
Baby, no

[Chorus]
This the kind of love they say is wrong
This what I been waiting for so long
Feel you on my body when you're gone
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms like
Back when we were laying on your floor (On the floor)
Hoping no one opens up the door (The door)
Feel you on my body wanting more (And I'm wanting more)
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms
You might also like[Bridge]
When you're back in my arms (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you're back in my arms (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
When you're back in my arms (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you're back in my arms
All we have is on the phone
When you hang up, don't let go

[Chorus]
This the kind of love they say is wrong
This what I been waiting for so long
Feel you on my body when you're gone
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms
Back when we were laying on your floor
Hoping no one opens up the door (Ooh)
Feel you on my body wanting more
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms (Yeah, yeah)
This the kind of love they say is wrong
(When you're back in my arms)
This what I been waiting for so long
(When you're back in my arms)
Feel you on my body when you're gone
(When you're back in my arms)
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms like
Back when we were laying on your floor
(When you're back in my arms)
Hoping no one opens up the door
(When you're back in my arms, yeah)
Feel you on my body wanting more
(When you're back in my arms)
We go back to the start when you're back in my arms (Arms)1Embed
