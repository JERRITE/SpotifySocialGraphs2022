It’s a Wonderful Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now tell me have you ever died before?
Have you ever realized your life was no more?
Have you ever looked down from up high in the sky
And watched your loved ones cry as they all bid you goodbye?
Well, I have
I’ve died in numerous ways
Hell, I die every other time I step on a stage
I’ve died in my dreams, killed by things bigger than me
I’ve died a million times, but never literally
And so I don’t know what resides on the other side
After we die, and know what? Nobody else does either
Despite no lack of answers from our world’s religions
With their ideas based in ancient fantasy fiction
I know we’re born then we grow then we’re old then we’re bored
Then we fight to the death and we die by the sword
Our world turns black, but a bright light calls
And we move into it as our final curtain falls
Hey hey hey, everybody, we’re all gonna die
So raise your glasses high 'cause we’re all gonna die
There’s nothing to fear, baby, no reason to cry
Just live the hell out of your life and never stop to ask why
I’m asking for ashes, I’m all dust or bust
There’s not a single theory about the afterlife I can trust
Like what if they’re right, and there really is a heaven
With all angels and virgins and clouds, seven seven seven
And ever at peace, and everyone’s so goddamn nice
And for this everything in my life was sacrificed
Forever and ever, for a life without sin?
Well, fuck that and fuck heaven, now I’ll never get in
Hell is the alternative, the religious version and
An eternal life of Satanic subservience
Submerged in a fiery lake of brimstone, no
I know I’m evil, but I’d never, no I’d never wanna go
But if they’re right, and I do go when my life ends
At the very least I’ll know that in hell I’ll have friends
Maybe the big guy and I’ll learn to get along
Perhaps Old Scratch will even like this song
[Chorus]
Hey hey hey, everybody, we’re all gonna die
You in the back there, you’re gonna die
Throw your hands up in the front ‘cause you’re gonna die
Everybody outside walking by’s gonna die

[Verse 2]
It’s useless to resist the cold chill of death’s trappings
The reaper comes violent or silently while you’re napping
I might even die while I’m on the mic rapping
When the breath has left the flesh, we all know what happens
Our bodies grow stiff and cold like mold in a kitchen
Our corpses spend quality time alone with morticians
Poked, prodded, embalmed and who knows what else
Then we’re painted till we barely even look like ourselves
Displayed in a casket, gasped at by those who weep
Driven to a cemetery, buried six feet deep
Or placed into an oven where our bodies are burned
Reduced to nothing but ashes which are gathered in urns
Sometimes scattered rather than stashed in a drawer
Often left unclaimed like all the Does in a morgue
Unless you’re a twin or half a suicide pact
You’re born alone, you’ll die alone, that’s a fact
We all are slowly dying from the time of our birth
When the heart stops beating, we return to the earth
But first join in a chorus for the void is before us
Before our final performance as corpses with rigor mortis
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey hey hey, everybody, we’re all gonna die
So raise your glasses high ‘cause we’re all gonna die
There’s nothing to fear, baby, no reason to cry
Just live the hell out of your life and never stop to ask why
Hey hey hey, everybody, we’re all gonna die
So raise your glasses high ‘cause we’re all gonna die
There’s nothing to fear, baby, no reason to cry
Just live the hell out of your life and never stop to ask whyEmbed
