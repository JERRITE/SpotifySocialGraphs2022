Coochie Anthem Lyrics[Intro: Yung Gravy]
Gravy
Get coochie
Ayy

[Verse 1: Yung Gravy]
Fuck on a bitch and I lay up (Lay up)
Sent one text, that's a lay up (Lay up)
Tell these muhfuckers to pay up
Takin' your cash, I'm the mayor (I'm the mayor)
Slidin' through cheeks, I'm a slayer
Ballin' like a Laker
Cook it up, cook it up, Gravy the baker
Get paper, bye, bitch, later, ayy
Everything catered, thick ass bitch is my waiter
[Pre-Chorus: Yung Gravy]
It's the only thing I dream about, vivid like a movie

Gettin' to the paper and the bread and gettin' to the

Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie

[Verse 2: Yung Gravy]
Mister butter, he back in the house
Pussy be chasin' me, think I'm a mouse
Feel like Jerry and Tom's your spouse
Stayin' on my toes, then she gon' pounce
Now she won't leave me alone
She a goddamn dog, I'm a goddamn bone
Need to get one of them little dog cones
You know those cone things dogs be wearin'
Get up off my cohones
Six figure check, not countin' the bonus
Big bread, can't keep focus
Smellin' like a bakery and I ain't even notice

Gettin' to the paper and the bread and the mothafuckin'

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie
