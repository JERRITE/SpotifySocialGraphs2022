TranslationsPortuguêsWhat It Feels Like Lyrics[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, the only reason I survive 'cause a nigga is special, first
You get successful, then it get stressful, thirst
Niggas gon' test you, see what your texture's worth
Diamonds and pipes, one of 'em pressure bursts
Street nigga, still I get checks, in spurts
I'm for peace, but before I get pressed, I murk
Better days pray for but expectin' worse
At this level, bullshit, I'm just less concernеd
Cruisin' in the 6, lookin' at the proceeds of rap music on my wrist
Drop another mixtapе, my shit boomin' out this bitch
Young Malcolm, I'm the leader of the movement out this bitch, look
And this is what it feels like (Feels like)
Reach a level, make you question, "Is it real life?"
All the weed good, all the pussy real tight
And the only rule, keep your dollar bills right
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Scorpion bricks, way before Aubrey's double disc
.40 on my lap, clap, sound like 40 did the mix
Filtered bass, sift coke like a Michelin star chef
Chef kiss to my wrist, I go dummy with my left
IRS on my dick try to audit all my checks, too late
You know they hate when you become more than they expect
You let them crackers storm your Capitol, put they feet up on your desk
And yet you talkin' tough to me, I lost all my little respect
I'm sellin' weed in the open, bringin' folks home from the feds
I know that payback's gon' be mean, I'm savin' all my little bread
Pray for me, y'all, one day I'ma have to pay for these thoughts
Real niggas is extinct, it ain't safe for me, my dawg
They killin' niggas in they own hoods, that make sense to you at all?
You burnt your bridge to the other side, you know you can't swim across
Y'all know niggas can't swim, they fried Mike after he died
Y'all know niggas can't win, you never land, all jokes aside
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton got mur—, hol' up
Assassinated, just to clarify further
What y'all gave birth is the chairman mixed with Jeff Fort
Big stepper on that jet with my legs crossed (Uh, uh)
Black stones on my neck, y'all can't kill Christ (Uh)
Black messiah is what I feel like (Woo)
Shit ain't gonna stop 'cause y'all spilled blood
We gon' turn up even more since y'all kill cuz'

And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)

[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like, as it fuckin' should)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like, feels so fuckin' good)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like, feels so fuckin' good)
And this is what it feels like (Feels like, feels like)
