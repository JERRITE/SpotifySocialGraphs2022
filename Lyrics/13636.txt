Followers Lyrics[Intro]
What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
Oh no!

[Verse 1]
Maybe you will see the world in a different light of day
Maybe you will feel no stress when you don't care what people say
No pressure what to post
Living life how it's supposed
Feeling good, no need to pose (eehh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I saw a pretty girl with my own eyes, not through a screen
And she was more than 2D, if you know what I mean
I started thinkin' with my own mind, not through machines
And ever since I made that change, thе world is smilin' at me

[Refrain]
It feel like...
(Woo) Oooohh
Oooohh
It feel like...
Oooohh
Ey, еy, ey!

[Chorus]
What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
Oh no!

[Verse 2]
All the places we could go
When we're not stuck in a zone (zone)
How are we free when we let algorithms take control? (whoa)
Tell me how are we supposed to vibe? (vibe)
When your life is your device
Let me give you some advice...
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Go see a pretty girl with your own eyes, not through a screen
'Cuz it's more clear than HD, with no glass in between
I started thinkin' with my own mind, not through machines
And ever since I made that change, the world is smilin' at me

[Refrain]
It feel like...
Ey! Oooohh
It feel like...
Ey! Oooohh
It feel like...
Go, go, go
Oooohh
It feel like...
Oooohh

[Verse 3]
All these comments in my brain is kinda stupid (stupid, stupid, stupid)
Sometimes I get why people lose it (I get it)
I wonder if they couldn't show it, would they even do it? (Would you even do it?)
Ha ha, I guess we're about to find out now!

[Chorus]
What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone? (Do you?)
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
When your followers gone...
[Bridge]
What you gonna do man? (Oooohh)
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
When your followers gone? (Oooohh)
You got no likes!
Oooohh
No DMs!
It's not going down!
Oooohh
Ha, ha, ha, ha (Oooohh)
Oooohh
Oooohh
Ey, ey! (Oooohh)

[Outro]
What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
When your followers gone...4Embed
