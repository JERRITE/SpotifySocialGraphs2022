Stone Love Lyrics[Verse]
Stone love with the number one sound
A four four in the background
A platinum selector of the time
Don't watch my size in this hall
While my back's against the wall
Take a ride, competition take a ride
Pull it operator try the other side
Thought it was over, so far from done
As they dance into the sun
[Chorus]
Some bring up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while my speakers erupt
The sound's sweeter in an echo chamber
Don't you know that they are the danger
Three bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
The best could only come from the Don Wesley
Close my eyes while I take a ride

[Verse]
Fold the bag in a yard style
Don't worry bout that you see it's all natural
Police chasing this bandilero
Runnin' down the road with my thick pay roll
One stop was my music shop
When I heard this guitar screamin'

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Some bring up new style holding trophy cups
Rory select while my speakers erupt
The sound's sweeter in an echo chamber
Don't you know that they are the danger
Three bottles of Cristal and it's agreed
The best could only come from the Don Wesley
Close my eyes and take a ride
You might also like[Outro]
Take a ride, everybody take a ride
Take a ride, everybody take a ride
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride( stone love with the number one sound)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love with the number one sound)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)
Take a ride, everybody take a ride (stone love, stone love, stone)Embed
