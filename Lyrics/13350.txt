Gold Satin Dreamer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Light bleeds in through the curtain lace
Sleep on the couch, where the flowers stay
And never bloom but only fade in the sun
I fill the bath, while I dream of the lake
I can smell the blood purged from raw steak
By the barbecue on a summer day
In the sun

[Pre Chorus]
But I find you here
In the blue light of the TV
And I feel you in the wind
Through the backscreen at night
With the kitchen tile cold on my cheek (Oh)
I Love you, baby
[Chorus]
Gold satin dreamer, gold satin heart
Gold satin dreamer
Waiting for it to get dark
I wait for it to get dark

[Verse 2]
All of those dreams left out in the sun
They run like syrup and clot like blood
Disfigured beyond recognition
In the sun

[Pre Chorus]
Colors fade from my memory and even though
Other faces I forget
Yours is carved out of stone
Tryna take you out of me is like
Trying to get smoke out of wood
Love you baby

[Chorus]
Gold satin dreamer, gold satin heart
Gold satin dreamer
Waiting for it to get dark (for it to get dark)
I wait for it to get darkYou might also likeEmbed
