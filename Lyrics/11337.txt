The shape iâ€™m in - 2000 - remaster LyricsGo out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Has anybody seen my lady
This livin' alone would drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I'm gonna go down by the water
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be lookin' for my maker
And I hear that that's where she's been?
Oh, out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I've just spent 60 days in the jail house
For the crime of having no dough, no no
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go
Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you're tryin' to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm inYou might also likeEmbed
