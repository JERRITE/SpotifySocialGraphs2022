That’s So Raven (Theme Song) Lyrics[Verse 1: Raven-Symoné & Orlando Brown]
If you could gaze into the future
You might think life would be a breeze (Life is a breeze)
Seeing trouble from a distance, yeah (Go Rae)
But it's not that easy (Oh no)
(Take 'em to the bridge now)

[Bridge]
I try to save the situation
Then I end up misbehaving
[Verse 2: Orlando Brown]
Hey, now, what ya say, now? 'Bout to put it down
Yeah, come on and ride with Rae now
And the future looks great now
And everything's gonna change, now
Let's rock

[Chorus: Raven-Symoné
Here we go
That's So Raven
It's the future I can see
That's So Raven
It's so mysterious to me
That's So Raven
It's the future I can see
That's So Raven
It's so mysterious to me, yeah
Yep, that's meYou might also like4Embed
