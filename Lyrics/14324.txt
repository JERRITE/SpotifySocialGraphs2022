Think Too Much, Feel Too Little Lyrics[Verse]
It started out all good
Saw you dancing across the room
Took a second glance
Took a breath
Took a chance and

[Chorus]
We get it we get it it's over
And I don't wanna go home
We get it we get it it's over
I go back to being alone
(alone alone alone)
[Verse]
Started out all good
Saw you dancing across the room
Took a second glance
Took a breath
Took a chance and

[Chorus]
We get it we get it it's over
And I don't wanna go home
We get it we get it it's over
I go back to being alone

(alone alone alone)

[Verse]
Everybody's got their own
Little things going on
Does it matter what you say?
You won't get underwayYou might also like2Embed
