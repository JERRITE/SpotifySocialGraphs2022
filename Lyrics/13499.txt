More Than I Want To Lyrics[Verse 1]
We swore that it was over on a pier in Santa Monica
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
At first it felt like closure, but there's no movin' on from us
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't forget you, I just don't know how
I know what we said, but where are you now?

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you more than I want to
I want you, I want you, I'll never know why
I hate that I called you, I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you more than I want to tonight
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I hate that I called you, I know that it's wrong to
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I want you, I want you more than I want to

[Drop]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
More than I want to tonight

[Verse 2]
I'll be starin' out the window, waitin' for your car again
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
I know that we both know we'll be takin' it too far again
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
It just might kill me, the watchin' you leave
But it's worth one more night of you here with me

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you more than I want to
I want you, I want you, I'll never know why
I hate that I called you, I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you more than I want to tonight

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I want you, I want you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
More than I want to
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I hate that I called you, I know that it's wrong to
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I want you, I want you more than I want to

[Drop]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
More than I want to

[Outro]
I hate that I called you, I know that it's wrong to
But I want you, I want you more than I want to tonightEmbed
