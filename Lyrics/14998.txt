Gravedancer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, slowly sinking‚ headed for disaster
Filling our lungs while we're circling the drain
Over and over
Around and around we go
Standing at the precipice of calamity
Just one step from the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
In the end it makes no difference
In the end it makes no difference
'Cause we're all hypnotized by the siren's call
[Chorus]
Then the song begins to play
As we dance around the grave
As we dance around the grave

[Verse 2]
Slowly sinking‚ headed for disaster
A sacrifice of self-destruction
Around and around again
To celebrate the end

[Chorus]
Then the song begins to play
As we dance around the grave
Knowing we will never change
We keep on dancing 'round the grave
Around and around the grave

[Outro]
Around and around and around again
To celebrate the end
I'll dance around this grave
Until it calls my nameYou might also likeEmbed
