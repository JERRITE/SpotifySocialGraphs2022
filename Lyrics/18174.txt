The Night You Left Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time stood still
When the door closed I told you to go
Waited 'til you got down the road
And that's when I broke

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hyperventilating in the bathroom
Like how the hell am I supposed to live without you?

[Chorus]
I don't remember the day that we met
But I'm still reliving the night that you left
When I shattered to pieces
Broke, but not bleeding
The worst kind of pain's buried
Too deep to see it
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, if that's how it ends
I don't wanna, I don't wanna love again
Oh, if that's how it ends
I don't wanna, I don't wanna love again

[Verse 2]
Don't know what we had between us
And I'm not religious but
I felt something higher up
But why would it give us an ending so vicious

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I make a living off our story
Maybe you work nine to five
I hate the way you're able to ignore me
I'm digging up wounds just to write

[Chorus]
I don't remember the day that we met
But I'm still reliving the night that you left
When I shattered to pieces
Broke, but not bleeding
The worst kind of pain's buried too deep to see it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, if that's how it ends
I don't wanna, I don't wanna love again
Oh, if that's how it ends
I don't wanna, I don't wanna love again
You might also like[Outro]
Trust me I know I made mistakes
But I ain't never loved someone that way
I just had so much to say
And you just fucking walked away
Oh, if that's how it ends
I don't wanna, I don't wanna love again
(Time stood still
When the door closed and I told you to go)Embed
