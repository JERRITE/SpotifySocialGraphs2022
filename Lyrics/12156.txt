This Dark Day LyricsI'm flushing the pills
I've lost all my will
This has been haunting me way to long
And I can't rewind
I'm the suffering kind
I've been abusing way to long
I'm breaking
Suffocating

I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done
Now I'm trapped in the wake
Of all my mistakes
I've been under for way to long
I sit and I shake
My heart starts to race
The poison lingers in my veins
I'm fading
Suffocating

I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done

You said I'd never change
You said I'd never had the strength
To break away

But now I've changed
It's time to turn the page
And walk away

It's time to walk away, it's time to away...
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done
You might also likeI'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done

Now that this dark day is doneEmbed
