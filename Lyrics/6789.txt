A.D.H.D., Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service
Mike G, you can't do this to ’em, man!
A-A-Astro, got it running

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm a boss, I don't need no co-sign
I took his main bitch, I hit that ho two times
You don’t know Frosty, you need to get new lines
Yeah, you swag jackin', boy, get you some new rhymes
Pass her off she, only good for my dick
Ty roll up with thirty's, got that in the clip
I'm not a gangster, still roll with the stick
Ten-thousand for a show, then I dip
She left her name, number, I might give her a call
Soon as I need her, got dick in her jaws
No cuffin' baby, thought I told you that's law
Country thotties, like my name Tim McGraw
I got no label, do numbers myself
You signing for 50, put up on the shelf
Don't call my phone, you ain't getting no help
Frost Gang, we winnin’, we movin’ in stealth
Fuck it, ayy!
I hit that hoe from the side
He talkin' that tough shit but he ain’t gon' slide
You say that you down but you not gon' ride
You say you get money, I know that you lie
Fuck that hoe twice, on god I'ma ditch her
Bitch I’m the shit, ten bands for a picture
I told her I love her, she know I won't kiss her
Bitch I'm big homie, stop calling me mister
Yeah, ayy, still push that big body benz
That kinda hoe called then fucked all her friends
This vitamin D, fuck nothing but tens
You wanna be me but can't take no wins
Rappers they only be thugs on the net
Before I got verified, I had a check
Might fuck on Teanna, her pussy so wet
I copped me some Bape, said fuck a patek
Yeezy buster cannot bust me
I told lil' Beandon, I got it, just trust me
Play with me wrong, DC gon' get ugly
Can't keep hoes at round, cause they get too fussy
Came from the south, move west to LA
Still at your necks, do this shit all day
He did a verse, that boy still gon' pay
Said, “Frosty, I'm blowing, I ain't come to play”You might also like1Embed
