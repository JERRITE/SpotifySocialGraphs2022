Got It In You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Holding back the flood
In this skyscraper town
You give all that sweat and blood
Now you think you're gonna drown
You can’t tell that you're bigger
Than the sea that you're sinking in
And you don’t know what you got
But you got it at your fingertips

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got it in you
Ooh, you got it in you
[Chorus]
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire is burning out
But I still see you shining through
You got it in you

[Verse 2]
Not everything you hear should sound like the truth
'Cause nobody else's words can define you
Maybe you don't see it
But you're quicker than the world can spin
You should know what you got
'Cause you got it at your fingertips

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got it in you
Ooh, you got it in you

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire is burning out
But I still see you shining through
You got it in you
You might also like[Chorus]
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire is burning out
But I still see you shining through
You got it in you

[Outro]
You got it in you
You got it in you8Embed
