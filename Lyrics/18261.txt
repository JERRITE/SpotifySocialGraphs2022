GT DRILL Lyrics[Intro]
Kitty gang
Uh, yeah
Kitty
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I don't like my man chatty
Pull up with gang and they all baddies
I don't beef online, I don't do tweets, I send the addy
Your man wanna lick on me, he said this pum-pum taste like candy
Hit it from the back, he grab that ass with the plan B came in handy
Fuck him on the weekend, I don't keep him, and thats worth a scissor
I don't claim that, you just fucked that man, he's not my mister
Your man see me, he choose up, talks up ting my pussy bruiser
I'm a GT girl, but I'm half Chinese, and I still won't fuck no noodle
[Chorus]
Shake it baby (shake it)
You wanna beat it (beat it)
You gotta eat it (you gotta eat it)
Just give me a reason (ayy)
Shake it baby (shake it)
You wanna fuck me (wanna fuck)
Just give me somе money (gimme some monеy)
You might just get lucky
Shake it baby (shake it)
You wanna beat it (beat it)
You gotta eat it (you gotta eat it)
Just give me a reason (ayy)
Shake it baby (shake it)
You wanna fuck me (wanna fuck)
Just give me some money (gimme some money)
You might just get lucky

[Verse 2]
Eat it, daddy gon' beat it

Flip it, reverse it, throw that ass in a circle
