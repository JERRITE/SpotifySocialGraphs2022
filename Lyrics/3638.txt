Christmas Tree Lyrics[방탄소년단의 뷔 "Christmas Tree" 가사]

[Verse 1]
In this moment I see you
It always comes around as I believed
When the rain stops you shine on me
Your light's the only thing that keeps the cold out
Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They're singing like Christmas trees for us
[Chorus]
So, I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

[Post-Chorus]
It's such a strange thing to do
Sometimes I don't understand you
But it always brings me back
To where you are

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
혹시 아니
너에겐 나만 아는 모습이 있어
한여름밤 오는 첫눈같이
믿기지 않는 기적 같은 놀라운 순간 넌
언젠가 또
불어온 바람에
마음이 날아다녀도
기다릴게
You might also like[Chorus]
So, I'll tеll you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gеts tangled up inside
And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
Tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
Tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are25Embed
