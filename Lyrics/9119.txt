Kickstart My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I get high, I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's a drug for me
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart
Always got the cops coming after me
Custom built bike doing 103
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, are you ready girls?
Ooh, are you ready now?
[Chorus]
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
Baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Ooh, yeah
Baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Skydive naked from an aeroplane
Or a lady with a body from outer space
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart
Say I got trouble, trouble in my eyes
I'm just looking for another good time
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, are you ready girls?
Yeah, are you ready now, now, now?

[Chorus]
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
Baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah
Baby

Kickstart my heart
When we started this band, all we needed
Needed was a laugh
Years gone by, I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged or hitting the stage
Adrenaline rushing through my veins
And I'd say we're still kicking ass
I say, ooh-ah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this to rock

[Chorus]
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
B-b-b-b-b-b-baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah
Baby
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah
Baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
[Outro]
