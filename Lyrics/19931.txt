â€‹fall for u Lyrics[Chorus]
Every single time I fall for you again
You need to break the chains and let me go away
All this pain that I've been through
You will never wanna be me
Every time I see you I feel frozen

[Verse]
You don't need to lie to yourself
Every time I wanna die I say it on a song
Every time I feel down I just think of you all the time
But now I can't 'cause you're gone
[Chorus]
Every single time I fall for you again
You need to break the chains and let me go away
All this pain that I've been through
You will never wanna be me
Every time I see you I feel frozenYou might also likeEmbed
