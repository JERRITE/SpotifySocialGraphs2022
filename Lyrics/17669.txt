Dove (Iâ€™ll Be Loving You) - T&F vs Moltosugo Club Mix LyricsWhy can't he give her his love, no more again?
Tears on her face and the dove, she cries, she knows...
She won't be able to fly away from him
She looks at red roses in spring
Now she won't be able to sing
The song of love

I'll open up my heart
I'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see
And then she questions the sun
Oh Why, Why Me?
The Sun doesn't answer
Oh God, can you help me?
The answer is easy my love
You built your own jail
You've always been part of the sky
So Why you keep staying by his side, away from me?

I'll open up my heart
I'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see

I'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see

She's a white dove and angel in disguise
She fell in love with the man...
But this man won't give back her love
So this is her cry
So this is her cry...
So this is her cry...

I'll open up my heart
I'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see
You might also likeI'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see

I'll be loving you forever and ever
I'll be part of you in the way I do
Come into my life so I can see...Embed
