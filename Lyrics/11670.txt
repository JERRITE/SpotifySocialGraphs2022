Let It All Out (10:05) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you love something, but you had enough
When you hold someone, but you're losing touch
You're rubbing salt deep in the cut
Oh, I-I-I
Every move you make is apocalypse
And you feel your fate at your fingertips
Oh, this is my last line defense
Oh, I-I-I

[Chorus]
Let it all out
(Oh, oh)
Let it all out
(Oh, oh)
Let it all out
[Verse 2]
I'm a thousand miles from my front door
And I can't recall what I came here for
My skin is thick, but I can't take much more
Oh, I-I-I

[Chorus]
Let it all out (Oh)
Let it all out (Oh)
Let it all out

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, let it all out
Let it all out
Yeah, let it all out

[Bridge]
Oh, I've been waitin'
For something to change, but
I can't escape this
Waterfall of doubt
All my blood, sweat, and tears
For twenty-some years
All bottled up and broken
Let it all out
Oh, I've been waitin'
For something to change, but
I can't escape this
Waterfall of doubt
All my blood, sweat, and tears
For twenty-some years
All bottled up and broken
Let it all out
Let it all out
Let it all out
Let it all out
Let it all out

Jesus, are you listenin'?
If you have a plan, can you fill me in?
Oh, Jesus if you're listening
I-I-I-I5Embed
