One Wish Lyrics[Intro]
MoraBeats

[Chorus]
If you had one wish
Tell me which bredrin you'd bring back
The demons are back
Angels fly when we leave our flats
Catfish gang don't believe in Snap
Three got shot 'cah they fiend for the vag
Search and destroy, they can't tweak on gang
Three last year, definition of S.A.D
If you had one wish
Tell me which bredrin you'd bring back
The demons are back
Angels fly when we leave our flats
Catfish gang don't believe in Snap
Three got shot 'cah they fiend for the vag
Search and destroy, they can't tweak on gang
Three last year, definition of S.a.D
[Verse]
They ain't slid back since Stompz turned casket
These bells are alarmin'
Point blank and you missed your target
They go shooting range and their drills are garbage
He was in the 6 when bro got fried
But he weren't involved when his oh boss died
These newplates get bowled or striked
The shotty got chopped, it was oversized
Your boy got chopped, nearly stole his eye
Three got dropped, we made soldiers fly
S.A.D, we been smoking guys
Rexx got burnt, he got over-fried
S got splashed, he got over-knifed
Thumpz got slashed, he got over-diced
Stegz got slapped, Bandz got slapped, Rexx got slapped and turned poltergeist
I ain't gotta talk on the drills we done but when man's in Wandsworth, you know the vibe
Two dot-dots and a stolen bike
Me and Graveyard nearly stole man's life
On numerous occasions countless bootings and shavings, it's blatant
Double tap when I slap this gauge ting
Or it's ching-chao when I swing this stainless
We cause the Lambeth tension
I can't say what we've done to their bredrins
But I basically have
If you know then you know, just fill in the blanks
Opp block tour me, Scribz, and Lam
Three waps up and a couple of shanks (Just in case)
But I got faith that these tools won't jam
Dinger that whip, plates doing mileage
Who's that cycling? Jump out bine him
Perfect timing, Snap said "Five mins" then he held bineage
They want me to rap, I want to close eyelids
Juggling both, pretty exciting
Free CRose, freedom's priceless
But I scored four out of five on license
Wind the window down from the backseat
One eye closed and you know the rest
Hold my breath, lock my arms, aim for chest
Headie's a bonus, but I ain't got vision like ST or bronem
Four door truck lights off just strolling
You won't hear "Ricky" before the smoking
Forensic puttin' up tents on grasses
No plasters are gonna fix dem wounds
And there's no way we can let this die down
Blackz got fried and half his goons
I find it funny lot of man don't like man
But move like my right hand when man's in the room
Move, bridges get burnt like opps in zoots
They wanna know about 3/9
It's called multiple times, they're the ones that died
I wear this mask for your pride
Opps know who it is there ain't a reason to hide
Trident keep taking my guys, talking 'bout "He got shot, he got knifed"
Two AM's, man buss that life
Now I'm off license I'm tryna make 1 fly
S.a.D most wanted members
Most of their bloods been shed from our section
We never put arms on Glendon
But all of their fencing and bootings are endless
Not a chance that they're winning don't stretch it
Beg man look at the size of the pendant
Beg man look at the size of the pendant
You might also like[Chorus]
If you had one wish
Tell me which bredrin you'd bring back
The demons are back
Angels fly when we leave our flats
Catfish gang don't believe in Snap
Three got shot 'cah they fiend for the vag
Search and destroy, they can't tweak on gang
Three last year, definition of S.a.D
If you had one wish
Tell me which bredrin you'd bring back
The demons are back
Angels fly when we leave our flats
Catfish gang don't believe in Snap
Three got shot 'cah they fiend for the vag
Search and destroy, they can't tweak on gang
Three last year, definition of S.a.D
