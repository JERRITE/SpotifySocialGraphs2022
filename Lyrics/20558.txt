Catch My Love Lyrics[Intro]
Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love

[Verse]
Heard you been looking for my love
Say I'm the one that you want
But are you good at keeping up?
Show me you got stamina
Close your eyes and count to ten
My rhythm's picking up again
So come and let the games begin
Check the rules I try to win
[Chorus]
Can you
Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love
You can run, You can hide
But can you, catch my love, catch my love

[Drop]
Catch my love, love

[Verse]
Heard you been looking for my love
Say I'm the one that you want
But are you good at keeping up?
Show me you got stamina
Close your eyes and count to 10
My rhythm's picking up again
So come and let thе games begin
Check thе rules I try to win

[Chorus]
Can you
Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love
You can run, You can hide
But can you, catch my love, catch my love
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Catch my love
Baby, can you catch my love?
Baby, can you catch my love?
Catch my love, loveEmbed
