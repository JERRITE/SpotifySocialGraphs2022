With My Face on the Floor Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I'm down with my face on the floor
Yes, I got what I asked for and more
Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floor

[Verse 2]
Now I'm standing with back to the wall
Waiting, praying the ceiling don't fall
Well, I once thought that I knew it all
Now I'm standing with back to the wall
[Bridge]
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll drop you a line" (drop you a line)
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll see you sometime"

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll drop you a line" (drop you a line)
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll see you sometime"

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm down with my face on the floor
Yes, I got what I asked for and more
Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floor

[Outro]
Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floorYou might also likeEmbed
