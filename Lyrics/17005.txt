Leave My Heart Alone LyricsDunbar-Gangwer

Should I believe your lies
You don't know how bad I want to
You've got such honest eyes
Aw but girl I know what's with you
Certain friends of mine
Came around to let it be known
Something funny's going on
So girl
Leave my heart alone
Leave my heart alone
It's been played with way too long
So girl, leave my heart alone

Thought that you needed my love
That's how I wanted it to be
But you were just putting me on
Eyes in love can never see
Even though the feeling is there
It would only end in despair
'Cause I know that you don't really care
So girl

Leave my heart alone
Leave my heart alone
It's been played with way too long
So girl, leave my heart alone

(Solo)

Even though the feeling is there
It would only end in despair
'Cause I know that you don't really care
So girl
You might also likeLeave my heart alone
Leave my heart alone
It's been played with way too long
So girl, leave my heart alone

Leave my heart alone
Leave my heart alone
It's been played with way too long
So girl, leave my heart aloneEmbed
