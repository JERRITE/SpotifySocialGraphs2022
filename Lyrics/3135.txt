Shooting Gallery Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll tell you how I woke up on the line
Now, sister, I almost saw the light
Look, my hands are tied
I'll see you in another hallway
Some other time

[Verse 2]
And I don't understand this big parade
It's a five star decoration day
Look, my hands are stained
I was washing them in the water
Where the water fell away
[Verse 3]
I'll tell you how I woke up on the line
Saw every soul in heaven passing by
Look, my hands are tied
I will see you in another station
Some other timeYou might also likeEmbed
