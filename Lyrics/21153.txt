Misery Loves Its Company LyricsListen close, as the rain falls down to the ground

It's true
We are, we are destined to fail
It's true
We are, we are destined to fail

There is a problem here, with our society
The absence of my tears is my sobriety
I have a growing fear, and you're not helping me
Am I the only one who realizes it's true?
Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!

You're persecuting me, showing hypocrisy
I have a remedy for your insecurity
It's all the same sadly, nobody works for free
Am I the only one who realizes it's true?

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!

Let your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see
Misery loves its company

When I dream, I see dawn turn
Into dusk, into dusk!

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!
You might also likeLet your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see
Misery loves its company

It's true
We are, we are destined to fail
It's true
We are, we are destined to fail1Embed
