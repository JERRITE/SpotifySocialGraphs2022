Hotel Ceiling Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can see it coming round full circle my friend
On the TV they said they had reported you dead
It was my fault cause I could've sworn that you said
It was easy to find another for your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
How does it feel to leave me this way
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say
I've been wonderin' now
[Chorus]
I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

[Verse 2]
When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do
Just being alone, no
Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know is
I'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold
I know I shouldn't have let you go

[Chorus]
I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now
