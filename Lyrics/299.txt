Late Night Drive Lyrics[Intro]
They should've treated you better
Girl they should've treated you better
They didn't show you enough love, now you just want more
Now you just want more
They didn't show you enough love, love

[Verse 1]
I know what you want, girl
You ain't even gotta tell, you know I got it
You feel like you deserve to be loved
Your exes did you wrong, that's why you stayed alone
But your lonely days are gone, I came out here to save you
It's the night of your life
Girl put on your prettiest dress
It's the night of your life
Girl you gon' forget your stress
(I wonder..)
How could they have treated you that way
You the kind of girl a nigga dream about, yeah
You ain't even got flaws I could look at you all day
(you've been lied to..)
Let me tell you things
Things that you never thought you would need to know
You're beautiful and sexy but them niggas never told you
Girl I guess they didn't know
Let me take you for a ride
Let me ease your mind
And if them niggas ever call you again
Girl tell them you'll be alright
[Chorus]
They should've treated you better
Girl they should've treated you better
They didn't show you enough love, now you just want more
Now you just want more
They didn't show you enough love, now you just want more girl
They should've treated you better
Girl they should've treated you better
They didn't show you enough love, now you just want more
Now you just want more
They didn't show you enough love, now you just want more girl

[Verse 2]
Girl you did everything right but it didn't work
I'm trying to give you the best cause you've already been through the worst
Let me take away your pain
Take a hit and take my hand
You haven't had fun in a while
Shawty Imma make you feel so alive
Don't worry about a thing
And girl just let me take you where you wanna go
Top back, windows down, volume up, ridin' slow
Imma take you for a ride, imma ease your mind
Them niggas ain't gonna call you again
Girl tell them everything is alright now

(Gone, gone, your lonely days are gone..)
You need someone that's down for you
You need someone that's down for you

Girl, let's take a late night drive, yeah
Girl, let's take a late night drive, yeah4Embed
