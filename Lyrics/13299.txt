Drinking Song LyricsThere's a light at the end that I know
Where culprits on carpets make sense of it all
And the sky is all indigo
And the young ones just want to go home

And the edge of the world makes it seem
That everyone gone is still singing the same song
And I can believe in these things:
That everyone's singing along
The good and the bad and the gone
And there's a light at the end of a dock
Sending green little postcards to a city I love so much
And the water makes sense of her laugh
And wrinkles the backs of my hands

There's a light at the end where I smoke
And your name puffs in colors with people I know
The song that was stuck in her head
Becomes all the words you forget
And everyone is singing along
The good and the bad and the goneYou might also like2Embed
