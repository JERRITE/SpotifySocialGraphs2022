We Run The Night (Teddy Cream Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Havana Brown]
We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 1: Havana Brown]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where it starts, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, ahhh
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart
[Chorus: Havana Brown]
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run–
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em

[Verse 2: Hooligan Hefs]
Yeah, don't need to say much, trust me they know (They know)
We turns heads and bring out phones (We do)
They wanna know me, just like Jax Jones
'Cause my wrist game freezing subzero (Uh)
Still got what you need if you wanna take flight
We made summertime look snow white (We did)
She come with you, but we see them eyes
'Cause she knows how gang get down on this side (She fights)
Her phone didn't die, she with the boys from the western
Everywhere we step, we're making an entrance
I got the whole club lit and they reppen
I got good girls throwing up 67 (Six)
Don't step on my toes, that's Dolce Gabbana
The devil wears Gucci, don't know about Prada
Shake some ass and save all the drama
Go run and tell 'em that it's Hefs and Havana (Gang)

We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 3: Havana Brown]
Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keep pulling me in (In)
Taking me so high up, up
A place that I've never been, ahhh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain

[Chorus: Havana Brown]
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run–
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!Embed
