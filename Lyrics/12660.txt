All I Want is Nothing Lyrics[Intro]
Check, check, check

[Chorus]
All I want is you
All I want is you

[Verse 1]
I think back to the heart attack
When our world seemed so brand new
I wasted time with a crooked spine
When I really should have spent my time with you
[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is nothing
All I want is what I can't have
All I want is nothing

If I can't have just one more second
Of your undivided attention

[Chorus]
All I want is you
All I want is you

[Verse 2]
All I have are memories
Of how you felt lying next to me
All we are is a memory
I used to have a best friend
Now just one more enemy

[Pre-Chorus]
All I want is nothing
All I want is what I can't have
All I want is nothing

[Bridge]
If I can't have just one more second of a time
When I was yours and you were mine
And all I want is everything we never had before
I still want more
You might also like[Chorus]
All I want is you
All I want is you

[Outro]
(I want you)
To want me, I want you
To want me and never leave

(I want you)
I want you to want me
I want you to never leave

I want you7Embed
