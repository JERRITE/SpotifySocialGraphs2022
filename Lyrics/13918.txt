Kill The Director Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've met someone that makes me feel seasick
Oh, what a skill to have, oh, what a skill
To have so many skills that make her distinctive
But they're not mine to have, no, they're not mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whenever she looks, I read the nearest paper
Though I don't care about the soaps;
No, I don't care about the soaps...
Though I'm acting like I'm in an EastEnders episode!

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If this is a rom-com, kill the director!
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If this is a rom-com, kill the director, please!

[Verse 2]
Carrots help us see much better in the dark
Don't talk to girls; they'll break your heart
And this is my head and this is my spout
But they work together; they can't figure anything out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So with the angst of a teenage band
Here's another song about a gender I'll never understand

Here's another song about a gender I'll never understand...

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If this is a rom-com, kill the director!
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If this is a rom-com, kill the director!
You might also like(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If this is a rom-com, kill the director, please!

[Outro]
This is no Bridget Jones
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Kill the director!)
This is no Bridget Jones
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Kill the director!)
This is no (Kill!) Bridget Jones (Kill!)
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Kill the director!)
This is no (Kill!) Bridget Jones (Kill!)
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Well, double kill the director)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) This is no Bridget Jones
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Kill the director!)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) This is no Bridget Jones
This is no Bridget, Bridget (Kill the director!)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) This is no Bridget Jones
This is no Bridget, Bridget Jones...7Embed
