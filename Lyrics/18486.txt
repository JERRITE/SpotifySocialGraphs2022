Faster Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]
A green light, unkind
No where to go on a one track mind
It's a break down at the wrong time
I'm catching up but I'm still behind

[Pre-Chorus]
We did it right, we did it right for some time
But I looked up and you were gone
We did it right, we did it right for some time
I couldn't give you what you want
[Chorus]
Cause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
Get it, get it, go until you get it right
And I hope you find it

Cause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
But you just got to kiss me one more time
So just kiss me goodbye

[Verse 2]
A red light, wrong way
I'm just a game that you like to play
It's a hot start to your cold ways
You got bored then you walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
You did it right, you did it right for some time
But I looked up and you were gone
You did it right, you did it right for some time
I couldn't give you what you want

[Chorus]
Cause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
Get it, get it, go until you get it right
And I hope you find it
You might also likeCause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
But you just got to kiss me one more time
So just kiss me goodbye

[Bridge]
So now you're moving on (you're moving on)
With no regrets (with no regrets)
But I'm still hanging on (still hanging on)
To every word you said (to every word you said)

[Chorus]
But you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
Get it, get it, go until you get it right
But you'll never find it, no

Cause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
Get it, get it, go until you get it right
And I hope you find it

Cause you just want to take a faster ride
Lower lows, higher highs
But you just got to kiss me one more time
So just kiss me goodbye
So just kiss me goodbyeEmbed
