Mas Tequila LyricsOne, two, three
All right now, here we go
Now we're gonna tell you a little story here
About the way we like to party
Take you on a trip
Hit it, whoo
That's right, uh

I'm goin' way down south where the big blue agave grow
Takin' a weekend trip down to Baja, Mexico
Where you can drink the water, but don't you eat the ice
Take your vitamin "T" with salt 'n lemon slice
I say (One shot, hey) Mas tequila
(Two shots, hey hey) Que veneno
(Three shots, hey) y Arriba
(Hey, hey, hey) Mas tequila, whoo

She did a mean macarena to the funky cold medina
Behind a body shot and three margaritas
She'll drink it straight from the bottle, terra cotta jug
From a boda bag, coppin' a major buzz

I say (One shot, hey) Mas tequila
(Two shots, hey hey) Que veneno
(Three shots, hey) y Arriba
(Hey, hey, hey) Mas tequila

Uno mas, bartender, whoo
Give me one more, mas tequila

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Yeah, you can drink the water, but don't you eat the ice
Take your vitamin "T" with salt 'n lemon slice

I say (One shot, hey) Mas tequila
(Two shots, hey hey) Que veneno
(Three shots, hey) y Arriba
(Hey, hey, hey) Mas tequila
You might also like(One shot, hey) More tequila!
(Two shots, hey hey) Que veneno
(Three shots...Hey!) Ay yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Mas tequila

No mas, no masEmbed
