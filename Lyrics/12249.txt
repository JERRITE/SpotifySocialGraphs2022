Finding Myself LyricsThey caught me with a thang had to a little time in the cell
I started redefining myself, I think im finding myself
You know nothing that this pain that i felt
Type of nigga wouldn't slide for yourself

[Verse 1:Mozzy]
I been trappin all my life
Tryna purchase the whole thang
The people know i came a long way
Lost shootas along the way
My auntie say I need to pray
Lord knows she believe in them better days
We just tryna maintain
You probably went thru the same thang
I needed love thats why a nigga gang bang
And you know its 4th or nothing
I ain't clutchin the torch for nothing
On the turf smoking ports with my youngin
Hold down the circumference
You ain't talkin guala then its nonsense
Me and mines we embrace conflict
Drop you with this hot shit
Theres a round house on the chop stick
He caught a body for me so we locked in
[Hook X2]
They caught me with a thang had to a little time in the cell
I started redefining myself, I think im finding myself
You know nothing that this pain that i felt
Type of nigga wouldn't slide for yourself


[Verse 2:Mozzy]
Uh huh.. Yeah the streets talkin
And it sound like we the main topic
They into poppin niggas up, Bruh my gang poppin
You can purchase from bruh we got the same product
Shit we all we got ahk thats what the game taught us
They only option get slid on or do the slidin
If it ain't one up top ahk you must be new to slidin
Its a number gang, I know you couldn't do the time
Yeah its a number game, i know you couldn't do the time
Call them from jail my family like what chu do this time ?
Before i send my brother to jail Id rather do his time
Attempted murder that mean he ain't do it right
We on the slom what chu niggas tryna do about it?
