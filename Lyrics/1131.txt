Finesse Lyrics[Intro]
That's funky
Oh, I dig this
Yir, right
[?] my shit
*laughter*
Yo

[1st Verse]
A pitbull in the pit, pitted agaisn't one of y'all fruits
So when I bite, it's right through to your pit
I'm a knife in your pit, raging bull on no bullpit
We ain't the same, miss me with your bullshit
4 clips, my movie packed with materiel
Eating y'all for breakfast, nigga I'm so cereal
Word to Al Gore and South Park
I'm a south paw, that'll leave ya body south parked
That means I'm stopping this drive, when I hope in my ride
Popping up, like a cop in disguise
Surprise poppin a nine
Popping his eyes, poppin his pops
And then guy's I'm don ameche
Only three times as pompous with lines
5 bags of crack, ain't as dope as my word shit
This shit comes natural, no need to rehearse this
Perfect
I could do this blindfolded on a typewriter
Turning white girl's faces reder than a five-rider
[Hook]
Got an issue, then get it off your chest, Ho
Otherwise, I suggest that you let go
Everybody says I'm so disrespectful
I agree, but I do it with finesse, though
-2x-

[2nd verse]
Look
I drop text with Finesse hoes
On my Kindle
Stick their letter up with the grip
I'm off to my next show
I show face, then shut down the whole place
Get paid, I'm eating, but only what's on your plate
Ingest, flipped bread, invest in my interest
Keep acting bulletproof, till I put em' in vests
My intent is to invent, something to kill you
Cause I don't fuck with you fam, this ain't incest
Burn some incense, as I'm burning the sour
Say it again, I'm burning y'all
And y'all niggas' sour
I'm ill, and you can't take it out of context
It's not up for debate, and nigga, there's no contest
My conquest is for nothing less than surpremecy
On an island eating peanut-butter and celery
Yeah
Rita Ora rubbing   my back, I'm sippin' a smoothie
In other words: I'm out to live life as a movie
You might also like[Hook]
Got an issue, then get it off your chest, Ho
Otherwise, I suggest that you let go
Everybody says I'm so disrespectful
I agree, but I do it with finesse, though
-2x-
(I'm cooking, look, look.)

[3rd verse]
Yo
Young nigga on a power trip
Making sure it ain't sweet for you niggas
With some sour spits
Dishing that rock, that leaves kryptonians powerless
As soon I step foot in this bitch,  I fucking deflower it
An illy spitter, forever knows as a witty nigga
Cause these other kats, are on some pussy shit like kitty litter
Boy I'm raw, all my opposes are corn hoes
Bars fucking shocking, like Blanca doing porno
Born so sick, doctors couldn't find a cure for me
So I evolved, and made songs from impurities
[?] versus me
Murdering a burglary
The blind showed the deaf
The deaf said they've heard of me
Urgentcy
Hip-hop's awaiting my arrival
For its revival, I'm one unrivaled
Psycho, trahshing all these others rappers who recycle
The same bullshit, now I'll break it out its cycle
I'm ghost
[Hook]
Got an issue, then get it off your chest, Ho
Otherwise, I suggest that you let go
Everybody says I'm so disrespectful
I agree, but I do it with finesse, though
Got an issue, then get it off your chest, Ho
Otherwise, I suggest that you let go
Everybody says I'm so disrespectful
I agree, but.. I got finesse, fuck you1Embed
