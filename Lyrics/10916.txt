Orpheus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come by the fire, lay down your head
My love, I see you're growing tired
So set the bad day by the bed
And rest a while, your eyes can close
You don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing
I know you miss the world, the one you knew
The one where everything made sense
Because you didn't know the truth, that's how it works
’Til the bottom drops out and we learn
We're all just hunters seeking solid ground
[Chorus]
Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos
Though I know it's blinding there's a way out
Say out loud, we will not give up on love now
No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We'll say we did not give up on love today

[Verse 2]
I'll show you good, restore your faith
I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place
Convince you, love, don’t breathe it in
You were written in the stars that we are swimming in
And it has no name, no guarantee
It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see
But that’s enough, if the bottom drops out
I hope my love was someone else's solid ground

[Chorus]
Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos
Though I know it's blinding there’s a way out
Say out loud, we will not give up on love now
No fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We'll say we did not give up on love today
We'll say we did not give up on love todayYou might also like4Embed
