Kangaroo Court Lyrics[Verse 1]
There’s a dark part of town
Where the girls get down
And I cannot wait for a chance to go
Wait for a chance to go
I’ve got my bad luck shoes and every excuse
To dance these blues away
Ain’t coming home
I ain’t coming home

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
[Verse 2]
In a dusty room I come to assume
That I’ve been doomed
To lose my mind tonight
Too weak to fight
So I try to save face and I rest my case
The judge pulls me aside, says, “C’est la vie
Let your darker side come out to feed”

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court

[Bridge]
“All rise...
I can't do sexy”

[Verse 3]
I commit the crime of wasting time
Always trying to rhyme
Yes, I am guilty
But don’t misunderstand me
I admit defeat then I move my feet
My history will never be repeated
I won’t ever be repeated

Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Sit up, sit up, sit up
It’s a kangaroo court
A kangaroo court27Embed
