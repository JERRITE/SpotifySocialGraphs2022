One More Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me we'll be alright whatever I might do
I may disappoint you 'cause I'm the one who always messes up everything
Being with me is like walking on a tightrope
So bring all of your rope, I think that I was born with broken wings

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I had to start a fire
Just tell me now, where to go
It's getting even higher
[Chorus]
If I promise you that I won't fuck up
From now on I'll be better forever
And I promise you that I will stay focused
Only you in my bed, like I once said
But only if you stay and help me find a way
But if I promise you that I won't fuck up
For now, I will be better forever
At least for one more day

[Verse 2]
Every time that I try pretending I'm a good girl
Like I'm in a fake world, maybe I just don't have what it takes

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I had to start a fire
Just tell me now, where to go
It's getting even higher

[Chorus]
If I promise you that I won't fuck up
From now on I'll be better forever
And I promise you that I will stay focused
Only you in my bed, like I once said
But only if you stay and help me find a way
But if I promise you that I won't fuck up
For now, I will be better forever
At least for one more day
You might also like[Bridge]
Would you mind hanging on a little longer?
And I will be just a little bit stronger

[Chorus]
If I promise you that I won't fuck up
From now on I'll be better forever
And I promise you that I will stay focused
Only you in my bed, like I once said
But only if you stay and help me find a way
But if I promise you that I won't fuck up
For now, I will be better forever
At least for one more day
At least for one more dayEmbed
