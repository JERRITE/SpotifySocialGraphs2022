Wasnâ€™t Born to Follow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain

[Verse 2]
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one knows the names of
[Verse 3]
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
'Til I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters

[Verse 4]
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I will want to dive beneath
The white cascading waters
She may beg, she may plead
She may argue with her logic

[Verse 6]
And mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
In the end she will surely know
I wasn't born to followYou might also like2Embed
