Cest La Vie Lyrics[Verse 1: Kezura]
I ain't never had much
Yeah, I never had a dolla'
So the dream was all I had
Livin' all alone, one mom, no dad
Two brothers in a pack
No bed, no [?]
When I had some [?], more like racks
But they always have my back, huh?
I love my mom so much
She's the only real reason I live, no cap
When the shit got hard and we got more scars
We were livin' on the edge of the map
Destined to fall, but I really want to jump
'Cause I thought it would get better for my mom at last
And I always got a heart, but I hardly got lovе
And they wonder why I'm always so sad, woah
'Cause I got lovе now, but the [?] without him
My soul has descended to ash, woah
[Hook: Kezura]
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
I'm gone, I'm gone, woah
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Heh, like what can you do?
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
I'm gone, I'm gone, yuh
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
Like what can you do?

[Bridge: Kezura]
Like what would you do?
What would you do?
Nigga, that's it
Uh

[Verse 2: Kezura]
What would you do if your life was in shambles and all of your family can't understand you?
A weird little loser at school, they can't stand you
Abuse on the daily is all that they hand you
And home was so damaged, these problems be solvin'
The bitch of a man putting hands on yo' mama
You trying to help, but he beat you regardless of prayer, li'l child
"You need to be stronger"

[Interlude: Kezura]
"You need to be stronger" (Uh)
"Like, man the fuck up" ("Man the fuck up")
"Stop being a little bitch" ("Man up")
"Be stronger"

She needed a soldier, but you just a folder
He hit like a boulder
One shot and it's over
You're only eight
Where the fuck is your shoulder?
You needed some holdin' when nobody hold you
Hidin' your tears and it start hittin' both of you
What are you supposed to do?
"You're so emotional"
"Hide your emotions and all of the things that you're goin' through"
Look, and keep your composure
Know shit won't get better
But please keep yo' head up
It's more than you think
Keep doin' chores and sweepin' the floor
'Cause he'll beat ya mama for dish in the sink
That was my life for a while
I've been tryna forget about all of these terrible things
But as of late, my eyes are achin'
There's so much pain these thoughts gon' bring, woah

[Hook: Kezura]
C'est la vie, c'est la vie (C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
I'm gone, I'm gone
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
What can you do?
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
I'm gone, I'm gone, woah
C'est la vie, c'est la vie (Lalala)
What can you do?
[Outro: Kezura]
C'est la vie, c'est la vie
[?] that's just life, woah
Uh, yeahEmbed
