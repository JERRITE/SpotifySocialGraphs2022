Whoâ€™s To Blame Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you we're the ones to blame
I wanna tell you that they're all the same
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

I wanna tell you they're the ones to frame
A million people and they're all the same
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
[Chorus]
But who knows
Oh, where it goes
Or what they do
Even though it's for you

[Verse 2]
I wanna tell you that I love the shame
That broken days are a part of the game
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

I wanna see how you can change your name
And throw it all for glory and fame
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
But she knows
Where I go
And what I do
And that's alright for you

[Verse 3 / Outro]
I wanna tell you we're the ones to blame
I wanna tell you that we're all the same
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah...You might also like1Embed
