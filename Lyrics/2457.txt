Telling the World Lyrics[Intro]
Mmmm
Oh, yeah
Ooh

[Verse]
Every part in my heart, I'm giving out
Every song on my lips, I'm singing out
Any fear in my soul, I'm letting go
And anyone who asks, I'll let 'em know
[Pre-Chorus]
She's the one, she's the one, I say it loud
She's the one, she's the one, I say it proud
Ring a bell, ring a bell for the whole crowd
Ring a bell, ring a bell

[Chorus]
I'm telling the world
That I've found the girl
The one I can live for
The one who deserves

[Verse]
Every part in my heart, I'm giving out
Every song on my lips, I'm singing out
Any fear in my soul, I'm letting go
And anyone who asks, I'll let 'em know

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the one, she's the one, I say it loud
She's the one, she's the one, I say it proud
Ring a bell, ring a bell for the whole crowd
Ring a bell, ring a bell

[Chorus]
I'm telling the world
That I've found the girl
The one I can live for
The one who deserves
To give all the light
A reason to fly
The one I can live for
A reason for life

The one who deserves
To give all the light
A reason to fly
The one I can live for
A reason for life
