I Want You Around (6LACK Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
It's not that I don't want you here (Yeah, yeah)
It's somethin' 'bout the way you stare into my eyes
I know that I don't make things clear (No)
I fall for you every time I try to resist you

[Refrain: Snoh Aalegra]
We can get away
Palm trees, beach views
Ordinary day
All I wanna hear is Innervisions on replay
And sit right next to you, you
I try not to show how I feel about you
Thinkin' we should wait, but we don't really want to
I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you
[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I don't wanna kiss you yet
I just wanna feel you
Feel you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I want you around (Around)
Around
I want you around (Around)
Around ('Round, 'round, 'round)
I want you around
Around
I want you around
Around, around, 'round, 'round

[Post-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I want you around

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
I want you to be around for this here, this year
Next year, every year, you've been here for every tear
You complete me even though I'm whole on my own
I had you on ice like the snow when it's gone
Look, you should slide my way, be easy on the brakes
Black ice, never catch me slippin' bae
I buy the extraordinary stay, in the A or in LA
Put that Snoh and Stevie Wonder on replay, replay
And we can get away, ridin' down PCH
Like it's back in the day and now the record on replay
I'm by your side like Sade, two lovers in the Bentley coupe, coupe
And I try not to show but eyes can't hide how I'm feelin' on the low
I just wanna two step until we can't no mo'
Gettin' older sittin' next to you, you (You, ooh, woo)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I don't wanna kiss you
Yeah, I just wanna feel you
Feel you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I want you around (Around)
Around
I want you around (Around)
Around ('Round, 'round)
I want you around (Know that I want you, yeah, yeah)
Around
I want you around (I want you around, yeah, yeah)
Around, around, 'round, 'round

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
I want you around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Oh, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round
Want you around6Embed
