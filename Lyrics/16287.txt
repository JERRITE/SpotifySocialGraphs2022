Ooh Boy Lyrics[Chorus]
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

[Verse 1]
Some of the sun shines Saturday's, you better watch out, girl
'Cause I'm on my way to put a piece of my love inside your heart
In other words, I'm looking for a real love
I want you walking by my window
And I don't even know your name
Well, my heart skips a beat, yeah-yeah, I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart, here it comes again
[Chorus]
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
Yes I do
Here I go again, here I go again, tell me what you need
Tell me what you want, tell it to my heart, girl
I swear I'll be a good man, and gonna do the best I can
There's a lot going around town
They say you love a girl like me and you would put her down
I hope with all my heart that it's not true
'Cause boy, I'd love to share my heart with you

[Chorus]
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, boy (Ooh, boy)
Never, never, never, never, ooh, boy (Ooh, boy), ooh-ooh
Ooh, boy, never, never, never, never, ooh, boy, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Some of the sun shines Saturday's, you better watch out, girl
'Cause I'm on my way to put a piece of my love in your heart
In other words, I'm looking for a real love

[Chorus]
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, boy (Ooh, boy), never, never, never, never, ooh, boy
(Ooh, boy), ooh-ooh, ooh, boy
Never, never, never, ooh, boy, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh, boy, I love you so, never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way tooEmbed
