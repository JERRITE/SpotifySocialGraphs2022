See Through Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know how to keep me waiting
You know there’s a call that you missed
You know that I get impatient
Cause I know you saw that shit

[Verse 2]
You got me on the back burn baby
You got me staying up all night
You got me in a situation
But you gotta know this isn’t right
[Pre-Chorus]
Got me out here, got me thinking what I would do
Got me in my head, got me wishing I was with you
Got me wishing I was with you

[Chorus]
I’ll be outside I been cooped up
Bloodshot eyes need a ride will you pick up
Couldn’t get it right and you’re sleeping on me now
Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow
Rebound feeling like a re-run
Everything that we’ve done
Funny how it all played out
You’re good at looking at me like I’m see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now

[Verse 3]
How do I get your attention
How does it feel to always have mine
How do I address this tension
How you’re looking through me every time

[Pre-Chorus]
Got me out here, got me thinking what I would do
Got me in my head, got me wishing I was with you
God, I’m wishing I was with you
You might also like[Chorus]
I’ll be outside I been cooped up
Bloodshot eyes need a ride will you pick up
Couldn’t get it right and you’re sleeping on me now
Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow
Rebound feeling like a re-run
Everything that we’ve done
Funny how it all played out
You’re good at looking at me like I’m see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now

[Chorus]
I’ll be outside I been cooped up
Bloodshot eyes need a ride will you pick up
Couldn’t get it right and you’re sleeping on me now
Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow
Rebound feeling like a re-run
Everything that we’ve done
Funny how it all played out
You’re good at looking at me like I’m see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now

[Outro]
Shoulda learned by now
I Shoulda learned by now
Shoulda learned by now
I Shoulda learned by now
You're good at looking at me like I'm see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now
Shoulda learned by now
I shoulda learned by now
Shoulda learned by now
I shoulda learned by now
You're good at looking at me like I'm see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now2Embed
