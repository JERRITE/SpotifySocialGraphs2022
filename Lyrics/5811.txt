Flying On the Ground Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a lonely soul on an empty sea
Behind a setting sun, I bet you can't find me
I'm flying on the ground
Yeah, I'm upside down
'Cause I got so high

[Verse 2]
I walk in single file on an open road
My head is in the clouds, got a heart of gold
I'm flying on the ground
Yeah, I'm upside down
'Cause I got so high
[Chorus]
You never do what you're told
You're coming out of the cold
And we'll say a prayer for everyone that we know
As the years go by, I'll wipe the tear from your eye
All we need is love and a placе we call home

[Chorus]
You nevеr do what you're told
I'm coming out of the cold
We'll say a prayer for everyone that we know
As the years go by, I'll dry the tears from your eye
All we need is love and a place we call home
You never do what you're told
I'm coming out of the cold
And we'll say a prayer for everyone that we know
As the years go by, I'll wipe the tears from your eye
All we need is love and a place we call home

[Verse 3]
Like a lonely soul on an empty sea
Behind a setting sun, I bet you can't find me
I'm flying on the ground
Yeah, I'm upside down
'Cause I got so high

I'm flying on the ground
Yeah, I'm upside down
'Cause I got so high3Embed
