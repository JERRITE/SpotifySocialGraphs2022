Are You OK? Lyrics[Intro]
Eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the darkness, losing my way home
Why are you so heartless? I can't be alone
I don't even know where I should go
I can't be without you, I can't be without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without you
[Chorus]
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without you
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without you

[Verse 2]
Wish you could see me falling, shadows in my eyes
Don't you hear me calling? Echoes in the sky
I don't even know where I should go
I can't be without you, I can't be without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without you

[Chorus]
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without you
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
I wanna feel you night and day, night and day
I'm calling you like eh-oh-eh, eh-oh-eh
'Cause I can't be without you, I can't be without youYou might also likeEmbed
