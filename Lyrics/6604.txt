My Little Box LyricsSilent in my sanity
I live safe inside my cell
In the darkness that surrounds me
I see my own special hell
Comfort in my suffering
Feeling warm inside this pain
Four walls coming down on me
Come on down again

I let you in, and you come onto me
You're so fucking brave
A chewed out lighted candle
Fell in my cold and empty cave
Somewhere in your world
They tell you "this is what the people need"
Don't bring all that shit in on me
And leave me here to bleed
Cradle falls
(Hail the ships around me saves lives)
(Hail the ships around me saves lives)
(Hail the ships around me saves lives)
Unholy walls

Cradle falls, unholy walls
Cradle falls

Silent in my sanity
I live safe inside my cell
In the darkness that surrounds me
I see my own special hell
Comfort in my suffering
Feeling warm inside this pain
Four walls coming down on me
Come on down again

You woke me out of my secret grave
You let your pretty world in

Cradle falls
(Sorry that it had to 've been this way)
(But you took me out of my skin)
Unholy walls
(You woke it out of my secret grave)
(You let your pretty world in)
Fall...

Did you dream it'd be so small?
My little box was perfect
'Til you destroyed it all
My sanctity of sorrow gone
Forever in it's place
The sacchrine sweet of you
Is all that's left to taste

Feeling claustrophobic
Now my world is closing in
Subtle retribution
Where I am and where I've been
I'll take you to a place
You never knew could be
Curled up, in my little box

Cradle fallsEmbed
