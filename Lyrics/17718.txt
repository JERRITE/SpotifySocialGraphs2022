Bow

[Verse 1: Suspect]
I'm the one they blame for a lot of their pain
I'm a rassclart beast and I can't be tamed
Grim Reaper, how you think I got that name?
Man tape estates, man don't play games (No)
When gang got a drop but got there late
They dropped Culprit, so I can't complain
They all wan' know why I open heads
My zombie don't want nuttin' but brains
Bring out the dots and bruck off the back
'Cah I might just call this shotgun Shane
This 10 or 11 gripped thе .12 gauge
Don't slip on the back road, get front pagеd (Bow)
Don't need a salon to get man wigged
Just give him a shave and watch him fade
Free Armed Response, free Risky, free T.Scam, free Smokeyy, free Broadday
[Verse 2: PR SAD]
Reckless was a minor setback
The killers home, all now they ain't get back
Music made them forget that
Two points elsewhere, you ain't no "get-back"
You ain't bring waps in gardens
Regularly use it, we take them marchin'
Reignited this beef, the verbal charge it
They done couple things, now 4's in a casket
Get side by side or it's up and under
We rip flesh, we ain't worry about jumpers
He wanna risk so we hit him with a bumper
See him fly high, no point looking under
Spin this coupe, slow down, who's smoking?
I didn't do it like Reckz in motion
I hopped out the car while the whip was rollin'
Hop that fence on my breath and smoked him

[Verse 3: DoRoad]
Why you frontin'? You ain't no fucking gunman, cuz'
Niggas can't say that 'bout me 'cause they seen or heard how I bun man, bun man
Skid 'round tryna get a pump, 'cah I made man jump when I hit him with the humpty dump
This six shot one will turn into a sticky one if I seen him, he's guaranteed Runtz, punk
I ain't no eediat, step 'round there and just beat it
But I'mma step 'round there and just beat it
I squeeze it when I see a man (Boy)
Then I'mma dash off when I got him
Peewee, my blood, man I love him, I got him
We got bad habits, we've got in common
Catch an opp then we pop him
You might also like[Verse 4: R6]
I got locked in a box, he got put in a box
It's a reckless world, Reckless got hit with the ancient dots (Bow)
Shotty come way too rusty, grease that down with WD-40 (Grease it)
Don't move your guns outside, we caught Reckless in a mash with 40 (40)
Size twelve boots, I got me a gym bag, me and my team are sporty (sporty)
And the way that I got down Dayz, the scars on him was way too naughty (Eurgh)
.44 chunky stones, we done Kloose like twice
Squeakz got fried, they put him on loan (They put him on sub)

[Verse 5: Ksav]
They say I don't rap in a Irish accent
Well, fuck you, I'm already on top (Don't care)
Who trap boy like Trapboy
Before I'll invest in jewels, I'll invest in a Glock (Bow)
Gang's on top, grind don't stop
Rapping or robbing, anyting for the guap
Bando settings, I'm chilling with fiends
And them man know that you can't beef us

[Verse 6: Offica]
He love to flex online like Balotelli
But he saw us and shat himself
Oh my, he left his gyal, doesn't matter
She's a jezebel (Jezzy)
And I heard that the pum pum smell
That why I don't go for a Rose's girl
But I'll still take her, not to beat
I'll ching you down while she gives me a twirl
[Verse 7: BT]
My bro DD fell in love with his tools
Fill up the car, let's glide on these fools (Let's go)
Bro jump in the ped and drive it, vroom, vroom (Ska, ska)
Bro roll-on man, bun man like a zoot
I'm addicted to smoke, ain't nothing like Snoop
My darg come tapped, he a young Ice Cube
I got sweets, tryna M2 yutes
Call it M&Ms get a sweety a two

[Verse 8: Dbo]
Beefin' with me, man I hope you're ready
Don't play with your mental health
'Cause the mash will leave you with more than a headache
And mans got a stick like Tiger Woods
Leave a hole in one like Headie (Woi, woi)
Aight, aye, steady, steady
Can't talk 'bout the things that we've done
'Cause mans on TV, now it gets techy

[Verse 9: Suspect]
On the ride no talk, just adlibs
Bare, skrrt-skrrt, ching-ching, bow-bow (Bow)
Dot dot's same size as Lil' Bow Wow
Stuff two cannons in, I'm tryna wild out (Find out)
Find out where you hang, gang gonna ride out
2 G's in my blunt, I'm getting high now, high now
Headshots, we don't sky 'round
Chest shot make a nigga lie down (Lie down)
Everything real that a nigga write down
Big stainless steel make a nigga pipe down
This war is too real can never die down
If it ain’t NB then I'm throwing 5s down
I'm S-Pect better respect
Might get your head wet
Tryna come and G check
Tryna pick which bro had a colourful set
Turn blue purple when I see red (Suwoop)

[Verse 10: Bas]
Ice cubes in a nice cold glass
And a Carta Blanca Bacardi white rum
And I’ve been out and about with
About ten more birds than I just did last week
Money walks into me bank like dogs at a picnic party
I've been bringin' in the bacon, darling
Yeah, yeah, how come nobody's got flows like this then?

[Verse 11: Pete]
Good question, I don't know
See, I ain't got a clue when I move so-so
No way, we don't play no games
Get crossed when your circles loose like tic-tac-toe
None of them work like Pete & Bas
Got a bigger net worth than Peter Jones
Run up in his house and I kicked off the door
When the family's out and he's home on his own

[Verse 12: PS]
Step in my Forces or my Jordans (Stepper)
Man get pierced like Morgan
Do it this mornin' (Yeah), now they're all mournin'
Coulda put more in, but it got borin' (Yeah, bu-bu-bu-bu)
Tizzy T, I put my all in
Opp block tourin', I'm like a foreign (Skrr)
Four door (Skrrt), four in, coulda put more in
But we just wanted to bang, we're whorin'

[Verse 13: Kwengface]
Still tryna do a man hashtag critically (Du-du-du)
Peng brown ting called Tiffany
All on me and her bracelet looks Tiffany (Oi, come here)
She gave me slop top in the drop top, nearly had an epiphany (Woo)
This black hand ting is Russian (Bap), the shined out kicks from Italy
The other side lit? I disagree

[Verse 14: PS]
I know the opp boys all sick of me (HSQ)
Can't lie, I can't even blame them (Hitsquad baby)
Pepper that beef, like, tickle me (Brrap, brrap)
I just come run and cause mayhem (Bap, bap)
I gotta skeng in the AM
Or when it's late tryna catch me a paigon (Bap, bap)
Ask me if dem man ride, it's blatant
I just say no, Ronald Reagan

[Verse 15: Kwengface]
Me and P like Freddy and Jason (Gang)
Two man, two anglos, man shave it (Woo)
In the two-point-two with two of my bruce
Three hours just lookin' for paigons (Where they at?)
Wave it, man shave it
Do it with flair put your face in the papers (Oi, oi)
Us man just done us a drill
Nostalgic, ain't done it in ages (Bap, bap)
