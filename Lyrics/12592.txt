Agora Lyrics[Verse 1: Yung $carecrow]
I be that schizo' motherfucker
Walking with a shovel
Keep the bodies covered
Lurking with my brothers
Killers by the hundred
Bleed out my fucking eyes
$carecrow the glorified
Fuckboys get mortified
Bitches get traumatized
Can't you see in my eyes
My heart's been paralyzed
Never apologize
God's been disqualified
Demons have colonized
My soul's been compromised
59 homicides
59 mommas cry
[Verse 2: Yung Mutt]
Just got a motherfucking hand full of cash, ho
Spend it all already on a hand full of hash, ho
Hope the weed will last, yo
Half an O' already smoked
Turning ghost, I'm burning O's
Chokin' and coughin', I do this shit often
Enough of the talkin' and pull out the weapon
We'll see how it goes
Bitch get to steppin', she sinkin' in snow
She bend the knee and now her whole throat feeling closed
$now leopard seekin' clothes
Throwing bones, these clothes ain't glowing, bitch, they need to keep you froze

[Verse 3: Crackhead Jynn]
Nigga, it's me and my people (People)
When my hitters that's a free throw (Free throw)
It's the Crackhead, rolling up napkins, have to talk all my shit, I'm a beast though (Beast though)
Started off tucking them pounds, they tucking the rounds, I'm not with the fucking around (Fuckin' around)
Pull out the chopper
If you start walking with them I'ma start cutting shit down
I'ma re-up in a couple of weeks and be rich with the squad like a couple of g's
Fuck with my niggas we coming for keeps
Had to pull out the fader, they fucked up the streets (Fucked up the streets)
I ain't the nigga who stuck on the streets
If you ready the die don't say nothin' to me (Nothin' to me)
I'ma bust out the track and then bust out the trap
I just put in that work for a fuck-load of green (Fuck-load of green)
Gas in the bag, never stuck on no E
I'm just living out life, feeling good as can be
If you see what I saw and you lived round my parts you'd be starving like Marvin or bustin, the heat (Bustin' the heat)
I'm just that nigga, you couldn't compete
Got that grass in the bag like it's wood in the tree
If you asking for action then we'll let you have it
You niggas afraid and you wouldn't want beef
How bout your bae when I wooded her deep
Has your bitch on her knees yelling "Put it on me"
Made her pack up her bags and said "Get the fuck out" 'cause her ass hella fat when she put on them jeans
I don't want static and you don't want heat
Pull the burner out that bag and it's hooked to your bean
Hood on the head and I'm bout to run up on this nigga who dead just for looking at me
I be so nutty, my wrist be so floody
My ice it be drippin', just fucked up the scene
Sipping on sprite like that stuff is for cheap and my tummy is numb that's a cup of some lean (Cup of some lean)
I be just chilling with me and my villains
You snitchin', you rats, give a fuck 'bout some cheese
I'm ready to harvest, the hardest and me
I'm just cooling it down like a cup of some tea (Cup of some tea)
And I'm out
You might also like[Beat Switch]

[Verse 4: Yung Dori]
Say I never make money, say I never go (Go)
Wanna make money, always fucking bitches at the show (Shows)
You a fake now
Sipping lean with Drake now (Drake)
Hidden fucking corpses in the motherfucking base now
Man, I'm bossing all you bitches, keepin' all of you opps livid
All I wish is for three bitches that can give me all their digits, woah
Sipping lean in the cup with the bitches looking rough
Looking tough to the bitches that looking for all the drugs

[Verse 5: Crackhead Jynn]
Now it's different decision
I put my dick in the center
And if you listen to Jynn
My niggas wishing you with it
It's like a simple predicament
If you with it we finish it
If you dip in the middle
We put a brick to your head and then
You a rodent you been a rat in the mist of it all
Even folding you benefit get the rest to get caught
If you told them you with it then get the business and ball
Get the business and ball
Like, damn how the fuck do you do that
You just another motherfucker in a durag
And you can tell me I'm a hustler from New Jack
Cause you get shot up in the gut, I thought you knew that, nigga
Imma prove that
If you two step
Brother we can do that
Get the crew bang nigga
Where the roots
Like where the tools at
Hit 'em with pool sticks
Like I'm gonna move back
Crackhead
[Outro: ?]
