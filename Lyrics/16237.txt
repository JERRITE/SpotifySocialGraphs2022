This Is My Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Ooh-ooh) Here we go, found my position, let's hit the road (Ooh-ooh)
Came alone, now my people here with me, I'm in my zone (Ooh-ooh)
Been around the block a time or two
I tell you where to go, I tell you how to move (Ooh-ooh)
I got longitudes and latitudes
Keep it movin', that's my attitude (Ooh-ooh)
Lookin' back, I know they probably doubt me
Now the city on my back, I wear it proudly (Ooh-ooh)
I'm a hero in the makin', huh
If I'm dreamin' you can't wake me (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I think I'm destined to win it
They playin' games, I ain't in it (Yeah, yeah)
I took the message and sent it
Feel likе I was born for this minute

[Chorus]
This is my time
I'm seizin' thе moment 'cause I gotta go 'fore the time's gone (Gone, gone)
Ain't scared of the dark 'cause I'm bringing the light when the night's long
I shine on
See it comin', I don't need a sign (Yeah, yeah)
This the moment, I'ma make it mine (Yeah, yeah)
This is my time (This is my time, yeah)
My time, my time now (This is my time, this is my time, yeah)
My time, my time (This is my time)

[Verse 2]
Shoulda known from the beginnin'
I was put on Earth to win it (Ooh-ooh)
What a tangled web we live in
Anyway you try to spin it (Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah)
Hero's lookin' at me in the mirror
Couldn't tell but now I see it clear (Ooh-ooh)
Got the confidence to make the moments matter even after all the interference (Ooh-ooh)

I think I'm destined to win it
They playin' games, I ain't in it (Yeah, yeah)
I took the message and sent it
Feel like I was born for this minute

[Chorus]
This is my time
I'm seizin' the moment 'cause I gotta go 'fore the time's gone (Gone, gone)
Ain't scared of the dark 'cause I'm bringing the light when the night's long (Long)
I shine on
See it comin', I don't need a sign (Yeah, yeah)
This the moment, I'ma make it mine (Get it, get it)
This is my time (This is my time, yeah)
My time, my time now (This is my time, this is my time, yeah)
My time, my time (This is my time)Embed
