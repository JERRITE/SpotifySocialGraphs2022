Better Version Lyrics[Verse 1]
I made the perfect you in my head
'Cause physically, you are the blueprint
But internally, goddamn, you’re a mess
So to stay with you, I had to imagine

[Pre-Chorus]
That he is perfect
Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it
[Chorus]
God, I love him
And when I'm with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can’t wait to see him again
My God, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again

[Verse 2]
More frequent visits would've been nice
But I don't want you knowing that there's somebody new
Sometimes, the guilt will clog up my mind
But is it cheating if I love a better version of you?

[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause he is perfect
Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it

[Chorus]
God, I love him
And when I’m with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can’t wait to see him again
My God, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can’t wait to see him again
You might also like[Outro]
My God, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again5Embed
