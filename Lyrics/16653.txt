Mommy, What’s A Funkadelic? Lyrics[Intro: Eddie Hazel]
If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions
(Hey baby, hey...had something last night...man, it was strange...it taste so good...it was some good stuff)
Do it again

Hey baby
What's your thang?
What say we touch each other?
Mess around and get our thing goin' on
[Chorus: Eddie Hazel]
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah!

[Verse 1: Eddie Hazel]
By the way, my name is Funk
I am not of your world
Hold still, baby, I won't do you no harm
I think I'll be good to you

Like I said, I won't do you no harm
I am Funkadelic
Dedicated to the feeling of good
And baby, I'm good at being good
Let me play with your emotions
For nothing is good unless you play with it

Yeah
Fly on...Fly on, baby
So...nasty!
I didn't make the rules
I follow them
And what's so nasty about funky music?
Heh, heh, feels good to me!
Lord!

Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba ba
Ba-ba ba ba bomp bomp buh buh buh buh bah! (x4)

[Verse 2: Eddie Hazel]
Whoa! Yeah!
Wait a minute
Do you feel that?
Lord...Lord, baby
Fly on...Fly on, baby
Let me kiss your mind

Let me slide a yard of tongue down your throat
There's nothing wrong with that
Merely a kiss
Why is everyone afraid to say:
Kiss me baby! (make it?)

Whoa, yeah
Kiss me baby!
Kiss me
I like it like that
I like it like that
Owww!
Play with it, baby
Play with it
Play with your emotions
Go ahead, brother
Release all of those feelings

[Outro: Eddie Hazel]
I recall, when I left a little town in North Carolina, I tried to escape this music. I said it was for the old country folks. I went to New York, got slick, got my hair made (heh-heh- heh-heh), I was cool. I was cool. But I had no groove, no groove. I had no groove
But now, fly on baby…Dig…
Can you feel that baby?
It’s called Funkadelic music. It will blow your funky mindEmbed
