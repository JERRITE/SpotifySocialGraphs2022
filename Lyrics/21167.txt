Whatâ€™s The Dillio? LyricsThere this little girl and i think shes so fine
And i'm not giving up until she is mine
See i wanna be her boy and i want her to be my girl because
Since i've met her i been in another world

(Pre Chorus)
She was just my friend and now i want more
Theres something special to her she's not just another whore
I said

(Chorus)
Whats the DDD Dillio Dillio
Whats the DDD Deal Deal . . . (4X)
See everybody else has gotten involved
And thats not the way this should have evolved
I should of just told you how i felt
But when i'm around you my words just melt
(Pre Chorus)

(Chorus) . . . (2X)You might also likeEmbed
