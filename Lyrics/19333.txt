Passive Aggressive Lyrics[Intro]
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together

[Verse 1]
'Cause there's a man on my arm
And your name's crossed on my heart
Forever
You are your actions, relations
And I don't have the patience
Or temper
[Pre-Chorus]
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together

[Chorus]
Are you still
Passive-aggressive?
'Cause when you see me attractive
You'rе reactive

[Verse 2]
It took a week or two
Getting ovеr you
But I love myself too much
To waste good years on bad love
And you've been falling hard these days
But it's not my job to save you
You got me singing

[Pre-Chorus]
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, are you still
Passive-aggressive?
'Cause when you see me attractive
You're reactive
(Don't hate on me, you brought this on yourself)
Are you still
Passive-aggressive?
(Don't hate on me, you brought this on yourself)
'Cause when you see me attractive
You're reactive
(Don't hate on me, you brought this on yourself)

[Bridge]
(I never loved you anyway)
La-di-da-da, la-di-da-da
La-di-da-da, la-di-da-da
(I never loved you anyway)
(Don't hate on me, you brought this on yourself)
La-di-da-da, la-di-da-da
La-di-da-da, la-di-da-da
(I never loved you anyway)


[Outro]
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together
Hallelujah, baby
We're no longer together1Embed
