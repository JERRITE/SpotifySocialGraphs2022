What Am I Gonna Do Lyrics[Intro]
All these years I been wanting you in my life
And now I finally I have you
I'ma do everything in my strength to keep you near
I care about you
I just wanna make you smile, hah
Let's go

[Verse 1]
All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
You wasn't looking for a man
You made it clear (clear to me)
And now I'm ever so glad that I have you near
[Pre-Chorus]
Here in my life just you and I
We can do whatever we want to
I'm living my life with you by my side
One day I'ma make you my wife, baby

[Chorus]
I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I'm gonna do?
I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I'm gonna do?

[Verse 2]
I'll do whatever puts a smile on my baby's face
Girl, you're my best friend and you can never be replaced
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do (Do for you)
You are one of my favorite dreams and I'm so glad that it came true

[Pre-Chorus]
Here in my life just you and I
We can go anywhere we want to
I'm living my life with you by my side
One day I'ma make you my wife, yes, I am

[Chorus]
I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I'm gonna do?
I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I'm gonna do?

Ooh, you got the best of me
Break it down
Ohh, ohh
