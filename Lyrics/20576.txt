Turn Me On Lyrics[Intro]
Doctor Love

[Verse 1]
Living life all wrong
'Cause I thought I knew what love was
But my heart, it was made of stone
I was out there seeking after hours for money, looks and power
But all that glows ain't always gold

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing
[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

[Post-Chorus]
Doctor Love
Doctor Love
Doctor Love

[Verse 2]
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
I can never dim the lights again

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Doctor Love

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

[Post-Chorus]
Doctor Love
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love, you know just what I needed)
