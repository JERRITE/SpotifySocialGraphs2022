T.C.B. Or T.Y.A. Lyrics[Intro]
Heeeeeey, hey!
Ugh, come on!
Huh!

[Verse 1]
People let me tell ya
What my woman told me today
She said "Baby, I still love ya
Love ya in the same old way
But you got to take care of business, like you're supposed to do
Or I ain't got no other choice, I got to replace you"
[Pre Chorus]
You better listen to me baby
Hear what I say
If you can't T.C.B
You got to T.Y.A.!

[Chorus]
Hey, hey! Ugh!
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)
Got to, got to get it
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)
Hear what I say

[Verse 2]
She done tellin' me about her friend whose name is Mary Jane
She said that her husband buys her everything
I tried to make her to see the place
Where money wasn't where it's at
She said "If you ain't got none, huh, think you betta get your hat"

[Pre Chorus]
Ow!
People, listen to me
Hear what I say
If you can't T.C.B
You got to T.Y.A.!

[Verse 3]
There was a time
A woman would stand by her man
It didn't matter much what shape his pocket was in
But now them days are gone if you ain't got no dough
All you're gonna hear is a sister say "No, no, no!"

Ugh!
Come on, I'm gonna tell y'all like it is

[Verse 4]
People let me tell ya
What my woman told me today
She said "Baby, I still love ya
Love ya in the same old way
But you got to take care of business, like you're supposed to do
Or I ain't got no other choice, I got to replace you"

[Pre Chorus]
You better listen to me baby
Hear what I say
If you can't T.C.B
You got to T.Y.A.!
[Chorus]
Hey, hey! Ugh!
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)
You got to tear it on down
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)
You got to turn yourself around
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)
(T.C.B. or T.Y.A)Embed
