Pushinâ€™ Forward Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mother, mother found me on her step
Gracious mother held me to her breast until the day I started pushin'
Too late to cry, she turned away, I started pushin'
I saw no future in this lack

[Chorus]
I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
[Verse 2]
Baby brother clinging to her hair
Gracious mother pleading, "Not another soul to bare"
He started pushin'
All my kings have fallen down
I started pushin'
Fallen heroes feed the ground

[Chorus]
I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

[Bridge]
Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown

[Outro]
Ah, I was pushin'
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward backYou might also like1Embed
