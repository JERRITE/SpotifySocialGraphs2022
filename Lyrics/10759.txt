Carry Anne Lyrics[Intro]
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now

[Verse 1]
If they don't pay your bills, pay them no mind
Move on to the friend, if he wasting time
He calling again? Then bitch hit decline
'Cause when they forget then you must remind
Such a big deal, ahead of its time
I keep it on chill, a hint of that lime
I'm in the field, most of the time
Lordette of the ghetto, they must have a shrine
Hallelujah, what it do? Yeah
If you want it gotta bust a move, yeah
If they offer one, tell 'em two, yeah
Baby, make 'em play by your rules, yeah
I'm cunt
Straight like that, with a lil' bit of stunt
Cartier frames help me see what I want
Red dirt and concrete mixed in a blunt
If you got a problem we can take it out front

[Pre-Chorus]
(This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now)
Uh
(This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now)

[Verse 2]
A good thing all up in his face
But I ain't got no time to waste
The only thing that keep me safe, is my safe
The bank is the only thing I'll ever chase
A love I never can replace
Speaking of, I'ma need you to pay me like you paying him
I put that word on my Timb, I just bent one of my rims
So you know I need them ends
Plus these babies need Pampers
Mo' hunnids for the dancers
And if she give you a shot then you better romance her
Straight shooter, I'm the answer, ho, pull up
Diamonds all up in my grill and my just un clou
Complimenting my bubble goose
I came up on that sunnydale and that jungle juice
You do not want me running loose, nah
[Pre-Chorus]
(This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now
This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now)

[Verse 3]
24 karats all up in my hydro
Mention my name, all the real girls know
I'm like an exclusive sneaker
Coming through the speaker
They line up to come see the show, a natural born killa
But I'ma need Spike to direct my Thriller
Girl, 47 aka Carry Anne
VA to BK, baby, we back again
Love to the baby mommas in Tallahassee
On they paper route and they keep it classy
My Detroit girls that keep it playa
Love to the grannies, aunties, Southern mayors, gettin' shit done
Shake it, bake it, rake it but I don't break it
Stack it all up and let nobody take it
Call 'em on the bullshit, nobody fake it
Say what you gotta say, fuck how they gon' take it

[Outro]

This my pussy, I can do what I want
Mm, I'm a big girl now)
