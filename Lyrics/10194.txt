TranslationsPortuguêsThe Walls Are Way Too Thin Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard you talking till the morning
Heavy whispers from the next room
You say it's never your intention
And I'm just in a bad mood
There was a possible connection on the table for a second
Then she made such an entrance
Can't stand all this tension
Can you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we cross paths by the bathroom
But I'd just rather be out of the picture
And I'll do my upmost to talk to you
But I just wanna be out—
I just wanna be out of the picture
[Chorus]
And, no, I'm not just gonna lay here and bite my tongue
I only wanna be here when she's gone
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin
Oh, I get down, I get down when she gets you high
I'm bored, I'm ignored, I'm being out of my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin
The walls are way too thin

[Verse 2]
You're blowing smoke rings in the corridors, I feel so cold
How come it rains inside?
The house is full, but I'm alone
With all the shit that still needs fixing, out of my control
It takes a hold of me
It takes a hold of me

[Pre-Chorus]
The same old sad songs I cling to
'Cause I just wanna be out—
I just wanna be out of the picture

[Chorus]
And, no, I'm not just gonna lay here and bite my tongue
I only wanna be here when she's gone
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin
Oh, I get down, I get down when she gets you high
I'm bored, I'm ignored, I'm being out of my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin
The walls are way too thin

And, no, I'm not just gonna lay here and bite my tongue
I only wanna be here when she's gone
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin

[Chorus]
Oh, I get down, I get down when she gets you high
I'm bored, I'm ignored, I'm being out of my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh, the walls are way too thin
The walls are way too thin

[Outro]
(Oh, I get down)
The walls are way too thin5Embed
