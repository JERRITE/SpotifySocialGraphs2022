Deadwood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't believe that I'm home all alone
Doesn't stop me from wanting to see you
Why the hell won't you pick up the phone? Hello?
Don't know which way is up anymore
No excuses and nothing to cling to
Oh, you're shaking me right to the core

[Chorus]
Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it around
[Verse 2]
All my friends say "I told you so"
They ain't making me feel any better
Buttons up and it's on with the show
Got me aching inside of my skin
No excuses and nothing to cling to
You gon' pay for the state that I'm in

[Chorus]
Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it around

[Bridge]
But you gon' see a wiser me
And I won't break down easily
Hell nah!

[Chorus]
Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it around
Just wanna let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn it around

Don't you go
Don't you go1Embed
