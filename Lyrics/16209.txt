Step Mom Lyrics[Verse 1]
We broke up
It was messy and I'm so embarrassed
Let it get the best of me, I wasn't thinkin' clearly
Uh, now I'll be the bigger person
And I won't lash out even though it really hurts
Another lesson learned, I'm movin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't call you in the middle of the night
Won't show up to your house without an invite
I won't beg you for a second chance
'Cause I got a man now with a good health plan
[Chorus]
I'm gonna steal your dad
Be the best he ever had
Send your mom home cryin' 'cause hе couldn't keep his promise
And he traded in his ring to givе me everything I wanted
Oh, I know we have a past
I think we should start from scratch
'Cause I'm with him now, but it could've been us
If you never did me wrong
I wouldn't be your stepmom

[Verse 2]
Told your dad I want a studio in your bedroom
It's lookin' comfortable and I'm lookin'
To take more from you (To take more from you)
I, I'm in it for the long haul
And I'll admit it, I've been unconventional
Some may say it's borderline insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't call me in the middle of the night
Don't show up to our house without an invite
Me and your father have been talkin' and
We think it's time you get off our phone plan

[Chorus]
I'm gonna steal your dad
Be the best he ever had
Send your mom home cryin' 'cause he couldn't keep his promise
And he traded in his ring to give me everything I wanted
Oh, I know we have a past
I think we should start from scratch
'Cause I'm with him now, but it could've been us
If you never did me wrong
I wouldn't be your stepmom

Is this how you saw my weddin'?
As another guest attendin'?
I don't wanna see you objectin'
When you're the one who fucked our endin'
Is this how you saw my weddin'?
As another guest attendin'?
I don't wanna see you objectin'
When you're the one who fucked our endin'

[Chorus]
I'm gonna steal your dad
Be the best he ever had
Send your mom home cryin' 'cause he couldn't keep his promise
And he traded in his ring to give me everything I wanted
Oh, I know we have a past
I think we should start from scratch (I think we should start from scratch)
'Cause I'm with him now, but it could've been us
If you never did me wrong
I wouldn't be your stepmomEmbed
