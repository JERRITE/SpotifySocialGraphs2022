A Love of Your Own LyricsThe sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
The longer it takes, the better you come to know
A love of your own

Don't you be afraid to give your heart
Never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid, walk right on in
The door is standing open, you know I'm always hoping
Oh, hoping
The sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
As far as you go, you're never too far behind
A love of your own

Don't you be afraid to shoot the moon
You never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid to change your tune
The offer's always open, you know I'm always hoping
You know I'm always hoping for

A love of my own to shelter me from the cold
A love of my own, oh
A love of my own, the traffic will always pale
A love of my own, oh yes, it will
A love of my own, you're never too far behind
A love of your own, you never know
Try it, try it

A love of my own to shelter me from the cold
A love of my own, it's not real
A love of my own, traffic will always pale
A love of my own
A love of my own, I'm never too far behind
A love of your own, keep on looking 'til you find
A love of your own, a love of your own
A love of your own, ah
Never know 'til you try it
A love of your own
A love of your own
Love of your own
You got to keep looking 'til you find
A love of your ownYou might also likeEmbed
