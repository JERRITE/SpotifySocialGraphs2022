Valley Girl (Flux Pavilion Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Frank Zappa]
Valley girl, she's a valley girl

[Spoken: Moon Zappa]
I am, like, in love with this guy
He's, like, a football player
He's the big man on campus
Yeah, he's got, like, a GQ haircut
He is, like, completely cute, I mean, we're talking dead attractive
I, like, saw him at the Galleria last weekend
And, like, he's really preppy, he wants to change his name to Kip, I am sure
So, like, I'm sitting there, and he goes "Are you into S&M?"
I'm like

[Breakdown 2: Moon Zappa, (Frank Zappa)]
I, like, want one of those, like, really cute Jeeps with, like, the, the convertible top
And, like, I would, like, drive it everywhere
It would be so hot, and, uh, radical, and intense
Like, well, I don't know
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like
(Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Valley girl, she's a valley girl)
Oh my god!

Valley girl, she's a valley girl)

[Spoken: Moon Zappa]
Oh my god, do you see that guy over there?
Is he, like, a babe, or what?
Oh no, no, he probably thinks I'm a beastie too
Well, I'm not, like, really ugly or anything, it's just, like, I don't know
I'm just kind of, like, shy about this bit, I'm sure
Do you slam dance, by any chance?
No? Oh well, you do you
Right, like, do you like go-go?
Uh huh, of course, I'm sure, what do you think?
