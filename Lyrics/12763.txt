Weâ€™ll Be a Dream Lyrics[Verse 1: Travis Clark]
Do you remember the nights
We'd stay up just laughing
Smiling for hours
At anything
Remember the nights
We drove around crazy in love

[Chorus: Travis Clark]
When the lights go out
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream
[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Do you remember the nights
We made our way dreaming
Hoping of being
Someone big
We were so young then
We were too crazy
In love

[Chorus: Travis Clark & Demi Lovato]
When the lights go out
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream

[Bridge: Travis Clark & Demi Lovato]
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa

[Chorus: Both]
When the lights go out
We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be

We'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream1Embed
