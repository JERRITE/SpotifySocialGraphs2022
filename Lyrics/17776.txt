French the Kid x Fumez the Engineer - Plugged In Part 1 Lyrics[Intro]
Swidom, killdom, yeah
Mason
It's French The Kid
Plugged in, shout out Fumez the Engineer
Real side of Essex, trust me
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Four boys in the ride 'cause I'm out on the glide with the guys and I'm feelin' good
Then I’m out in the club with a wap and a slug and a car if we need, we should
Yeah, I swear life's short when you wear that hood
Caught on a slide anywhere you could
Gang dancin' with the stolen goods
When he backed his shank at mine and stood
And G, I'm out an about with the boys and I ride with the toy from Jimmy and John
I back beef, don't chat, that's long
Back the shooter to Caribbean songs
Best señorita, viens Carolina, bébé, j'te vois, j't'emmène sur la ville
Fuck with the kid, my boys are all gangsters
C'est la mafioso, frère, c'est mon style
Look, I don't envy you, but my bro can tell that you envy me
Yeah, I got bad B’s try fill my jeans
Can't fuck them 'cah they don't say "Please"
They don't care about girls, I just need my G’s
I got girls on my T-I-P, no V-I-D when I show my P’s
Hit the lick then breathe
Just ask French if you need them waps
I don't care about shh, I don't use them things
And G, I don't gang bang, but I play with the toys, that's tizz or gym
I got approached by a hater once
He spoke down to me, so I filled him in
When I was young, had a thing for the guns
All the girls inside never liked my trim
[Chorus]
Toute ma clique, animale, tu sais qu'on aime la guerre
On aime le biff comme un cannibale
Tu sais qu'on aime la (Woo)
I grab mash from the travellers, woah, woah
Little pussy, come and fuck with us, yeah
Toute ma clique, animale, tu sais qu'on aime la guerre
On aime le biff comme un cannibale
Tu sais qu'on aime la (Woo)
I grab mash from the travellers, woah, woah
Little pussy, come and fuck with us, yeah

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't say I'm legal cuz, but guess I get paid from illegal stuff
I get waved, don't need no buzz
And I hunt on my prey like an eagle does
Look, I don't care how you feel, but there ain't no deal 'til the job gets done
I'm the chosen one, G, I walk through locks with a loaded gun
My bro grips in the race, serious links got sticks in the rave
This one girl tried liftin' my weight
Told her, "Come back", get dicked in a Wraith
Got more bad for singing my song
Take one back to vibin' on gone
Back when time is movin' so long
They know me as French, to you it's the don
Two hands up when I step in the room
Got boys on the left and the right with the shooter
G, I'm sat in the club right now
Got the girls all around with the black Sambuca
Pics with me, it's mad to see
I never really changed for the fame like Luther
Back then, I was out with a shooter
But now in the bar, gettin' drinks with a hooter
Scrap that, you don't know me cuz', you don't know my life, you don't know my pain
Essex Prince on the mic' from the block to the sights, got the ties with big boy names
I can't feel my face, got a baddie in the back, she don't wanna get trained
She just wanna give brain
Nah, I'm messin', I just wanna get paid
You might also like[Chorus]
Toute ma clique, animale, tu sais qu'on aime la guerre
On aime le biff comme un cannibale
Tu sais qu'on aime la (Woo)
I grab mash from the travellers, woah, woah
Little pussy, come and fuck with us, yeah
