TranslationsFran√ßaisP.S. Fuck You Cunt Lyrics[Chorus: Fat Nick]
All of these Perkies don't save me
All of these Xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Ho, don't you save me
P.S. I love you, P.S. I hate you
Please, don't you save me
All of these Perkies don't save me
All of these Xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Ho, don't you save me
P.S. I love you, P.S. I hate you
Please, don't you save me
[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Emotionless, I'm standing here
It's Damian, I take your hand
We don't regret the sins we made
I overdose to cover pain
She left me here and slit my heart
I can't see light, I turn to dark
These rope burns be my beauty marks
And ain't shit sweet, my life is tart
Please don't love me, don't get close
I can't show you this side of me
I'm burnin' up, I'm next to death, they want me for eternity
All this frenzy clothing money cover up my true feelings
On the verge of suicide, my knot at throat, oh, Mom, don't cry
My VVS' shinin', Margiela shoes I'm tryin'
Bitch, I'm hot as fuck, I just want more money piling
Some milligrams, I'm wylin'
Ten toes down, I'm grounded
Perkies wash away some pain and got my brain cells fryin'
Drip, watch me come
You a crumb, I'm rich and young
Skrrting off, fast as fuck
You a hater, broke as fuck
I just need me all this
You can't get me all this
Look what you created
Take a shot, I hope you don't miss
You might also like[Chorus: Fat Nick]
All of these Perkies don't save me
All of these Xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Ho, don't you save me
P.S. I love you, P.S. I hate you
Please, don't you save me
All of these Perkies don't save me
All of these Xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Ho, don't you save me
P.S. I love you, P.S. I hate you
Please, don't you save me

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I just wanna close my eyes and never wake up tonight (Close my eyes and never wake up tonight)
I just wanna make you mine, gettin' high in the candlelight (Make you mine, gettin' high in the candlelight)
Baby, I just poured an eight in that two-liter Sprite, fuck it, I'll be fine (Fuck it, I'll be fine)
I just dropped a couple green pills in my Sprite, baby, I'll be fine
And fuck it, if I die, it was by your side
Hold me closer, I can't be your man
I don't think you understand
It's obvious to me I wasn't in the plan
Never sober, I can't be your man
I don't think you understand
It's obvious to me, you want my rubber bands
