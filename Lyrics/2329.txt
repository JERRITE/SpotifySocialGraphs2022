​next door Lyrics[Verse 1: ASTN]
I was looking outside
When she caught my eye
A pretty thing moving things
In the house right next to mine
Wonder what it's like
To be next to you (To you, you-you)
Oh, are you busy tonight?
Can I give you a hand with the move?

[Pre-Chorus: ASTN]
Wonder if I'm her type
Know that it's her first night
Wanna play it cool but I
Can't wait too long
Crop top with your green eyes
What's under those Levi's?
We ain't gotta sleep tonight
If that's what you want
[Chorus: ASTN]
Ooh, I think that I
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl next door
Never been so in love with a girl like this before
She's got no idea how I'm really feeling
I'm in lovе, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl nеxt door
With the girl next door
With the girl next door
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl next door (Next door)
With the girl next door (Next door)
With the girl next door (Next door)
Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl next door (Door)

[Verse 2: Amelia Moore]
I was just outside
When I saw this guy
6'3" white tee with the Nikes
Ooh, he's just my type
Boy, won't you just come on over (Over)
Both of your hands on my shoulders (Shoulders)
Put on the TV, act like we're watching
Nobody's watching, you can come closer
Skip all the talking, yeah
(Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Amelia Moore]
I can see you staring through the window (Window)
We should go ahead and skip the intro (Skip the intro)
We can start it slow and see where things go (See where things go)
I might be going crazy 'cause I think I
You might also like[Chorus: Amelia Moore]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the boy next door
Never been so in love with a boy like this before
He's got no idea how I'm really feeling
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the boy next door
With the boy next door
With the boy next door (Yes, I am)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the boy next door (Next door)
With the boy next door (Next door)
With the boy next door (Next door)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the boy next door

[Bridge: Amelia Moore, ASTN, Amelia Moore & ASTN]
I can see you staring through the window
Can we go ahead and skip the intro?
Cut the tension with a knife
Know want to take a bite
Take it slow and see where things go
Oh-oh, I'm

[Chorus: ASTN, Amelia Moore, ASTN & Amelia Moore]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl next door
Boy next door
With the girl next door (Yeah)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the boy next door (Baby, next door)
With the girl next door (Next door)
With the boy next door (Next door)
Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the girl next doorEmbed
