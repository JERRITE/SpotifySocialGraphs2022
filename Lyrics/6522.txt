I’m Coming For It Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Tinnesz & GREYLEE]
I've been pushin' up against the ceilin'
Tensions in my blood and I can feel it
They try to keep me down
But they can't stop me now

[Verse 2: Sam Tinnesz & GREYLEE]
Eyes are straight ahead, I'm on the frontline
Livin' on the edge until it's all mine
This is my time
[Chorus: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
I'm comin' for it
Walkin' through the fire
I'm comin' for it
And now it's do or die
From the ashes, hungry for the madness
Goin' in 'til the whole world knows
I'm comin' for it

[Verse 3: Sam Tinnesz, GREYLEE & Both]
Fightin' for the top of every mountain
Hear the battle drum, my heart is poundin'
Give it all I've got

[Chorus: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
I'm comin' for it
Walkin' through the fire
I'm comin' for it
And now it's do or die
From the ashes, hungry for the madnеss
Goin' in 'til the whole world knows
I'm comin' for it

[Post-Chorus: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
You might also like[Bridge: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
I won't sleep until the flamеs are finished burnin'
Fightin' for my life because I know I have to earn it
I would still win the war at my weakest
Put it all on the line 'cause you know

[Pre-Chorus: GREYLEE]
I'm coming for it
Oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm coming for it
Yeah, yeah, uh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
You know I'm comin' for it

[Chorus: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
I'm comin' for it
Walkin' through the fire
I'm comin' for it
And now it's do or die
From the ashes, hungry for the madness
Goin' in 'til the whole world knows
I'm comin' for it

[Post-Chorus: GREYLEE & Sam Tinnesz]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm comin' for itEmbed
