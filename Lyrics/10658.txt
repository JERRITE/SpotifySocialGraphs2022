Gwapamole Lyrics[Chorus:]
I be getting gwapamole
Chilling like my Rollie
Balling like Ginóbili
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole
I be getting gwapamole
Chilly like my Rollie
Hit a hundred thousand
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole
[Verse 1:]
Getting the bag on the regular
Bitch, I'm a star, I ain't regular
I'll chop up the weight then I smuggle it
All on my block, yeah, they smother me
I fly in the sky, now I'm sonning them
All in my heels 'cause I'm running shit
Giving them hits after hits
Like it's Mayweather up in the studio
Winning again and again and again and again
I'm big body like I'm Precious
Hardbody like I'm flexing
Lit mami, she a blessing
Keep on finessin' at life
Shout out to all of my slimes
That's bossed up, never washed up
That ain't with no 9 to 5

[Chorus:]
I be getting gwapamole
Chilling like my Rollie
Balling like Ginóbili
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole
I be getting gwapamole
Chilly like my Rollie
Hit a hundred thousand
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole

Tell ya label I don't need a deal
They better come hard like a quarterback
Tell 'em I got my own team, man
And they can do all of that
I ain't talkin' itty bitty silly really petty funny advance money
Talking big bucks that'll make any rainy day seem sunny
'Cause bitches that race to the bag
I'm cutting 'em off like a tag
I pop lock, never dab
I criss cross with a jab
I'm souped up and they mad
My whole life got 'em sad
I'm really on another level
Bitch, I'm Michael Jackson, tell 'em who's bad

[Chorus:]
I be getting gwapamole
Chilling like my Rollie
Balling like Ginóbili
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole
I be getting gwapamole
Chilly like my Rollie
Hit a hundred thousand
Now they acting like they know me
Getting Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Gwapa-Mole
Mole, Mole, Mole3Embed
