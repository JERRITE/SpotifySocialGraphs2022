1UL Lyrics[Intro]
As if I could ever be the one you love

[Verse 1]
I’m here whenever you want
’Cause it feels so good, I can’t get enough
You know you’re all that I want
But it hurts me when you say I’m the one

[Pre-Chorus]
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
One you love
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love

[Chorus]
One you love
So
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love

[Verse 2]
I lie alone in my bed
And I wonder if I’ll see you again
I know I’m playing pretend
But the visions of you won’t leave my head

[Pre-Chorus]
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
One you love
You might also likeSo touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love

[Chorus]
The one you love
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love
As if I could ever be the one you love
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love

[Bridge]
I lie alone in my bed
And I wonder if I’ll see you again
I know I’m playing pretend
But the visions of you won’t leave my head
[Pre-Chorus]
So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one…

[Chorus]
As if I could ever be, ever be the one you love
As if I could ever be the one you love
So touch my body
That’s what you want
But don’t touch my heart
As if I could ever be the one you love1Embed
