Dream Warriors Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lie awake and dread the lonely nights
I'm not alone
I wonder if these heavy eyes
Can face the unknown
When I close my eyes, I realize
You'll come my way
I'm standin' in the night alone
Forever together

[Chorus]
We're the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
[Verse 2]
I feel the touch comin' over me
I can't explain
I hear the voices callin' out
Callin' my name
It's the same desire to feel the fire
That's comin' your way
I'm standin' in the night alone
Forever together

[Chorus]
We're the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
We're the dream warriors
(Dream warriors)
Ain't gonna dream no more
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Sweet revenge, the bitter end
This time
Break the spell of illusion
Bound together waiting for you
You might also like[Chorus]
Dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
We're the dream warriors
(Dream warriors)
Ain't gonna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
(Dream warriors)
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone

[Outro]
(Dream warriors)
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
(Dream warriors)
Forever
(Dream warriors)
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
(Dream warriors)
