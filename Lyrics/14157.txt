Lake Superior Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a stretch of sand, sweet northern breeze
Manitowoc put Avery on the beach
Your alibi, will never do
When the whole town's got it out for you
Judge Fox, the Great Lake stain
Got Superior wanting to pull its own drain
To abandon the shore, where the poor get whipped
And the fat get fatter and the rich stay rich
Where the mice of men are chained and bruised
Where to stand accused is to admit you lose
[Chorus]
I wanna know people outdoor
Ain't gonna go out and act insane
Insane
My baby girl, out in a world
All alone burns a hole in my brain
My brain
I wanna know people outdoor
Ain't gonna go out and act insane
Insane
My baby boy, pride and joy
He's gonna go out and do the same
Just saying

[Verse 2]
In the hall of harm disgraceful sounds
Manitowoc knows how to gavel pound
They crack it right and shoot on site
Do you know where your baby is tonite?
The red tide is back again
Old Superior's new McCarthy clan
Back on the shore, where the poor get whipped
And the fat get fatter and the rich stay rich
Where the mice of men are chained and bruised
Where to stand accused is to admit you lose
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna know people outdoor
Ain't gonna go out and act insane
Insane
My baby girl, out in a world
All alone burns a hole in my brain
My brain
I wanna know people outdoor
Ain't gonna go out and act insane
Insane
My baby boy, pride and joy
He's gonna go out and do the same
Just saying3Embed
