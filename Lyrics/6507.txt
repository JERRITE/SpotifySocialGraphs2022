Loser Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Tinnesz]
I'm getting really sick of the pretend
This plastic fruit just fits right in
Peer pressure giving me the spins
Gorilla suit but I'm a chimp
I'm way too old for this
Keeping up with the social masochist
You don't even know what anxious is
I know it's hard to imagine

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz]
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when'd you get so cool
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don't need a spot in your crew
There's a party up inside of my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don't mind, if you don't mind
I'd rather be a loser
Yeah, I'd rather be a loser
[Verse 2: Bryce Fox]
I just wanna keep to myself
Don't need a trophy up on that shelf
I don't need the wine with the cheese plate
Hell, I can feed myself
With a pool full of pills on the real
Not the one to act like everything's great
Hollywood cosplay everything fake
I know that life gets petty
But it's not so heavy
When I put that L to my face

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz]
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when'd you get so cool
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don't need a spot in your crew
There's a party up inside of my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don't mind, if you don't mind
I'd rather be a loser
Yeah, I'd rather be a loser
You might also like[Bridge: Bryce Fox & Same Tinnesz]
Give me some space
You can have the
Rest of the cake
Gotta get this off my
Chest, need a break
But why does it bother you?
But why does it bother you?
But why does it bother you?

[Chorus: Sam Tinnesz  & Bryce Fox
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when'd you get so cool
I'd rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don't need a spot in your crew
There's a party up inside of my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don't mind, if you don't mind
I'd rather be a loser
I'd rather be a loser

[Outro: Bruce Fox, Sam Tinnesz]
I'd rather be a loser
I'd rather be a loser
I'd rather be a loser
Loser
I'd rather be a loserEmbed
