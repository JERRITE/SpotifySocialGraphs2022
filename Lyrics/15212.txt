4 Da Trap Lyrics[Chorus]
I remember those days I ain't have no racks (Yeah)
I remember those days I ain't have no stacks
You want respect, go get you a stat
Three dicks on me, ya ho know where one at
I'm double down 'cause I ain't goin' like that
My niggas got dirty birds and they shoot with that MAC
Made a check off a voice for my niggas in the trap (Yeah)

[Verse]
These niggas late and they tryna ride my wave
Got me a check, now these hoes wanna get saved
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'ma go get the money, I don't know about you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my niggas bang red but I love the blue (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Hammer on me and these niggas, they be nails
Quickdraw shit, that Glick slow his heart down like a snail (Yeah)
All yo potnas pussy, if y'all get caught, y'all gon' tell
I could never rat, I would rather go to Hell
I can't sleep, don't got no heart just like my Glick (Like my Glick)
Came up from nothin', I turned them rags into them riches
Them racks is on me, I remember them days they was my wishes
Came a long way, I had to stay down, I was ambitious
[Chorus]
I remember those days I ain't have no racks (Yeah)
I remember those days I ain't have no stacks
You want respect, go get you a stat
Three dicks on me, ya ho know where one at
I'm double down 'cause I ain't goin' like that
My niggas got dirty birds and they shoot with that MAC
Made a check off a voice for my niggas in the trap (Yeah)
