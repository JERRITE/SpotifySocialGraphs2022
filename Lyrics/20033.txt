Solitude LyricsI could write novels
Or build houses
Untwine my tongue
And learn a new language
Could grow my hair long to the floor
If and only if i’m not monitored

Solitude, sweet solitude
Strip every layer until i’m nude
Solitude, sweet solitude
I’ll never tell them the truth
I’m taking time to learn how to walk again
Swallowing books whole and learning how to talk again
Oh no~~ i’m not worried about making friends
In the end they’re not the ones sitting in my skin

Withdraw the curtains
And lock the door
I will work myself to the core
Laying silent, jaded on thе floor
Indecision bleeding from every porе

Solitude, sweet solitude
Strip every layer until i’m nude
Solitude, sweet solitude
I’ll never tell them the truth

*chorus*

[my thoughts possess me with a dose of coercion
Won’t take a breath until i’m fully converted
I have changed and for that i’m certain
I know i must resurrect a clearer person]
