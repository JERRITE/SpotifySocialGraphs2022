All Night Alone (Chris Lake Edit) Lyrics[Intro]
I never felt so good
Because the light is blue
My body is supercar
And I can course you too
The beat is dope, I feel
I had a trip for real
The music is super loud
I dance all night alone

I never felt so good
My body is supercar
The beat is dope, I feel
The music is super loud
[Drop]
I never felt so good
Because the light is blue
My body is supercar
And I can course you too
The beat is dope, I feel
I had a trip for real
The music is super loud
I dance all night alone

I never felt so good
Because the light is blue
My body is supercar
And I can course you too
The beat is dope, I feel
I had a trip for real
The music is super loud
I dance all night alone

[Breakdown]
I never felt so good
My body is supercar
The beat is dope, I feel
The music is super loud
I haven't felt so good
My body is supercar
The beat is dope, I feel
The music is super loud

I never felt so good
Because the light is blue
My body is supercar
And I can course you too
The beat is dope, I feel
I had a trip for real
The music is super loud
I dance all night alone

I never felt so good
Because the light is blue
My body is supercar
And I can course you too
The beat is dope, I feel
I had a trip for real
The music is super loud
I dance all night aloneEmbed
