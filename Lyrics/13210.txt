Breakfast With Lou Lyrics[Chorus]
Same bleach, same steeze
Same old blue jeans
I wanna have breakfast with Lou
Same face, same plate
Same old good taste
I wanna have breakfast with Lou

[Verse 1]
See the sunrise light his lonesome face
He takes a walk down to his favorite place
He nods to the waitress
Another Sunday, honey hello
And when the city gets loud
He comes to cool it down with me
[Chorus]
Same lips, same kicks
Same old leather zip
I wanna have breakfast with Lou
Same look, same walk
Same old slick talk
I wanna have breakfast with Lou

[Verse 2]
We sit down at the velvet booth in the back
Lou orders his pancakes double stacked
He starts the talking, he's telling me
All about his paradise
He's got a rock'n'roll heart
And he'd tore it apart for me

[Chorus]
Same freaks, same creeps
Same old dirty streets
I wanna have breakfast with Lou
Same dreams, same steeze
Tell me what it all means
I wanna have breakfast with Lou

[Bridge]
He speaks low when it's loud around
And takes advantage of that quiet sound
I keep on wondering what he's thinking about
And while he's talking to me
And at the end of the seat
Puts on his GGT
Takes a look at me and leaves

Dark shades, black suede
Just another perfect day
I wanna have breakfast with Lou
White light, white heat
Coney Island, back beat
I wanna have breakfast with LouEmbed
