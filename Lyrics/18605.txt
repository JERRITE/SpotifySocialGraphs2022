TranslationsPortuguÃªsKiss Me Again Lyrics[Intro]
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
I cannot complain today
Because I'm around you
And I could not look the other way
Because I love you

[Verse 1]
And it's hard to admit
But deep in my cold heart
There's a voice that screams out
And it's screaming
[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again

[Verse 2]
Blissful ignorance
Let me sink into it for once
Like a child
Let me feel like a child

[Verse 3]
And it's hard not to be ashamed
But deep in my stone heart
There's a voice that screams out
And it's screaming

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again
