Iâ€™m in Miami Bitch Lyrics[Verse 1: Redfoo]
When I step on the scene (Scene)
Y'all know me (Me)
'Cause I walk with a limp
Like a old school pimp, a real OG
I'm rocking Vans (Vans)
I'm in the sand (Sand)
I've a got a Red Bull and vodka up in my hand

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & SkyBlu]
Hey, you lookin' kind of cute (Ayy)
In that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this is what I want to do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini, girl
[Chorus: Redfoo & SkyBlu]
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
Everybody on smash (Smash)
Hands in the air (Air)
I'm feelin' on the ass (Ass)
Like a nigga don't care (Like a nigga don't care)
I've got a plan, what's your cell?
We playing naked Twister back at my hotel

[Pre-Chorus: Redfoo & SkyBlu]
Hey, you lookin' kind of cute (Ayy)
In that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this is what I want to do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini, girl

[Chorus: Redfoo & SkyBlu]
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch
Drink all day (Uh)
Play all night (Ayy)
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch

It's mornin' time (Shh) and the girls still there
They lying naked with some asses in the air

But I say I'll be back gotta get some more Coronas
