It Takes Two To Tango Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm the vision from all your nightmares
I’m the source of all your screams
I torture and I paralyze
I crush of all your dreams
I’m the baddest around I assure you
The destroyer of your world
So you think you can escape me?
Think again, my little girl

[Hook]
It takes two to tango, so let me count you in
You're on your feet so dance along, come join my world of sin
[Verse 2]
You treat me with indignation
But the truth is so thinly veiled
The might I possess, it allures you
The greed in you prevails
The power you’ve always dreamt of
It could be yours one day
You swear it won’t consume you?
Think again, my protégé

[Hook]
It takes two to tango, so let me count you in
You know the steps so dance along, come join my world of sin

[Verse 3]
To you, I’m a compulsion
You’re spellbound by my smile
Give up control to me now
I’ll possess you for a while
You lust for domination
I torment you and you fawn
You think you want the truth now?
Think again, my little pawn

[Hook]
It takes two to tango, so let me count you in
You hear the beat so dance along, come join my world of sin
You might also like[Verse 4]
I seep into each recess
Devour each shred of hope
I linger for eternity
You bind me, I cut the rope
I’ve got tendrils in this planet
Drive me back, I’ll reappear
You think you can contain me?
Think again, my brother dear

[Hook]
It takes two to tango, so let me count you in
It’s in your blood so dance along, come join my world of sin1Embed
