​​everything sucks (feat. GRACEY) Lyrics[Verse 1: vaultboy]
Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is great, no, really
I haven't thought about my ex today
Oh, wait, fuck, I just did
But I went outside for the first time
In a few days and it felt nice
And I might try doing exercise
Haha, not really

[Chorus: vaultboy]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
[Verse 2: GRACEY]
Everything sucks, just joking
But if I were to tell you that I really ain't coping
Do you think you could give me some advice?
Something I ain't already tried, that'll make me feel alright?
I've been going like, outside when my phone dies
Get some fresh air, see them bright blue skies
But I still can't get him out of my mind
That's normal, right?

[Chorus: vaultboy & GRACEY]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
