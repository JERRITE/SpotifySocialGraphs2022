Brainstorm Lyrics[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Rolling weed while I'm drivin' nigga
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm cool with the new me
Some niggas told me they wish I'd go back to the old me
But don't even know me
'Cause I be on some rich nigga shit
Guess they comfortable with the broke me
I blow by the O.Z
But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jackin'
Now you muthafuckas owe me
Some people ask why I be low-key
Guess I'm too real for me to act like I'm your homie
A lot of niggas try to get involved when they see you make it on your own
Hear they songs, but they not as real
'Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give
And we ain't talkin' if it's not about a dollar bill, uh
[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so many things runnin' through my mind
Just drink and smoke, while the flow unwinds

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Amazed how I get so much paper
I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater
Gettin' my lemonade squeezed fresh
No 'frigerator touchin' my shit
Private island, waiter, chef, maid, butler
Riding jet skis all day
Come home the bed already made for us
Niggas who's winnin' like this they got a name for us
Fucking champions 'cause we run the game, Forrest

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got so many things running through my mind (Let me hear it)
Just drink and smoke, while the flow unwinds

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
I mean why'd you do that?
Is it, like, how does that fall in line with your whole ideology of being a Taylor?
Umm, you know, Taylors do what they want to do
That's, that's, that's the ideology about it
And just like, for me, personally, it's like, umm
I prided myself on, like, doing things that were different
And kinda like unacceptable and weird, you know what I'm sayin'?
So when I start seeing things become the norm
I kinda stray away from thatYou might also like13Embed
