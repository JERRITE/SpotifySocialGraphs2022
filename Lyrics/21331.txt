Live and Let Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say "Live and let live"
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)
[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

[Verse 2]
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)You might also like4Embed
