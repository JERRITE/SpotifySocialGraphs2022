Chitty Bang Lyrics[Verse 1: Erika Costell]
Baby, tell what you in it for
You a 10 messin' with a 4
She kick you when you down, only stress you out
I know I can give you more
You just tryna chill and meditate
But she be fuckin' up your feng shui
Gettin' in your head, makin' you a mess
You don't need the deadweight

[Pre-Chorus: Erika Costell]
Guys like you, don't need drama
Don't need girls who honestly just suck
[Chorus: Erika Costell]
Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, chitty, chitty, boom
I'mma fix you up like this shit brand new
Like a different man when I'm done with you
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, chitty, chitty, boom
I'mma get alone alone up in my room
Like a different man when I'm done with you
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

[Refrain: Erika Costell]
Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Chitty, chitty, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[Verse 2: Jake Paul]
Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, chitty, chitty, boo
Flat stomach, green eyes, she a 10.2
And I splash in that body, emulate Shamu (splash)
And I'm tryna change her last name to "Jake Paul's Boo" (ayy)
She the type of girl that can hang with the crew (yeah)
She the type of girl to back it up on you (she do)
She the type of girl, no makeup, still cute (she still cute)
Ayy, girl, ayy girl, lemme get with you
