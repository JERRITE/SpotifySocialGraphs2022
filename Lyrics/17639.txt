Tragic Lyrics[Verse 1: Amber Van Day]
Look what you did
I've had enough
Lying to yourself
Sayin’ 'I don't love’
You went and hid
You're acting tough
Telling everyone that I fucked you up

[Pre-Chorus: Amber Van Day]
But I can't handle these games
I know you better
Say you will but won't change
And you cry, know it's all fake
You should know better
I see through your whole thing
[Chorus: Amber Van Day]
Sad for yourself
It's my fault, my love
Think that you're tragic
Think you're tragic
Not what I felt, swear to God, my love
You been so dramatic
Think you’re tragic
(Think you’re tragic)

Sad for yourself
It's my fault, my love
Think that you’re tragic
Think you're tragic
Not what I felt, swear to God, my love
You've been so dramatic
Think you're tragic

[Verse 2: Amber Van Day]
Let’s take it back
When we were kids
You remember how I was feeling it
Know as a fact
I'd never ditch you
And I never did, and I never will
And I can never heal you, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Amber Van Day]
But I can't handle these games
I know you better
Say you will but won't change
And you cry, know it's all fake
You should know better
I see through your whole thing

[Chorus: Amber Van Day]
Sad for yourself
It's my fault, my love
Think that you're tragic
Think you're tragic
Not what I felt, swear to God, my love
You've been so dramatic
Think you're tragic
(Think you're tragic)

Sad for yourself
It's my fault, my love
Think that you're tragic
Think you're tragic
Not what I felt, swear to God, my love
You've been so dramatic
Think you're tragicEmbed
