Caught By My Shadow LyricsYou and I got burned in paradise
High heels on our knees
One by one that's what we do for fun
Playing hide and seek

High rise living side by side
How thirsty can you be?
Cold as hell laughter could do you well
Fighting in the street

Have you been in a house so big
Where rooms don't exist
Where some rooms don't exist?
Two wrongs don't make a right
Three rights make a left
Sing to me, livin' in fantasy
Find a place to rest

Saw her eyes blue as the naked skies
You were on TV
Who where you what could I make you do
What was left to see

Have you been in a house so big
Where rooms don't exist
Where some rooms don't exist?

High rise living side by side
How thirsty can you be?
Cold as hell laughter could do you well
Fighting in the street

Saw her eyes blue as the naked skies
You were on TV
Who were you what could I make you do
Fighting industry
Fighting in the streetYou might also like4Embed
