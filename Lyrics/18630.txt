More than meets the eye LyricsSo here's the story bout a girl and boy who ever were so passionate
Never showed embarrasment there never was comparrison
Compared to their relationship, cause they went so well together
But sometimes they couldn't make their mind up like the melbourne weather
But they were perfect, yeah they were the best team
Chilling in the bed sheets with lip stick on his left cheek
From the kisses she was giving him man they're goofy
Cuddling and snuggling as they would wach their movies
One day she would get a text, then send back an sms, back
He leaned over but she wouldn't let him see the messages
He didn't really care he didn't really take notice
Till she stood up and she said she had to go quick
"was it something i've done? please stay and talk to me"
But she ignored the plee and said that she was forced to leave
He said just "stay here? i promise i can make it right"
She shook her head and left she didn't even say good bye
CHORUS
There's more than meet's the eye, you're never gonna learn to forgive, to forget, to love again
If you can't see there's more than meets the eye, take a step back and look in the reflection
There's more, than meets, the eye

VERSE TWO

He tried to message her, he tried calling
No matter he did, she just ignored him
He turned paranoid, he started losing it
His heart was bruised and oozin man he was confused as shit
He went to her house, hoping he could chat to her
He'd do anything just hoping to hear back from her
He walked up the stairs, straight into her room to see
Her quickly turn off her computer screen
So he started yelling out stuff like "i dont need this"
I can't even look at you, i know that you're cheating
I did everything you ever wanted, i can't believe you
You're so see through, man i don't need you
He said this sucks, now i give up
Worst mistake of all was falling in love
He said, "so whos the guy, i just really need an answer"
She whiped away a tear and said "im sorry, i have cancer"

VERSE 3

His whole world turned upside down
She's facing death shes on the front line now
But she forgave him cause he loved her with all his heart
But at that moments when his world began to fall apart
He knew that shortly that she'd be facing heavens gates
So just to make her smile he started talking bout a wedding date
Cause hes in love with her, and shes in love with him
It doesn't phase him that she has a couple months to live
He said i want to make it clear to you
From now, till the very end, i promise that i'm here for you
She cried a thousand tears untill she had no more left
He whispered that he loved her as he kissed her on the forehead



CHORUS
There's more than meet's the eye, you're never gonna learn to forgive, to forget, to love again
If you can't see there's more than meets the eye, take a step back and look in the reflection
There's more, than meets, the eyeEmbed
