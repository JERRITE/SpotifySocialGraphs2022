Federal Emergency Management Agency Lyrics[Verse 1]
2026 devoid of life no one to protect us
Memories are far for astral ancestors connect us
Control centers are spaceships they scan the tissues for face lift
Making sure it's amazingly vacant, half living being half machine
The process of biotech it's seen in your spleen in green ????
Lightyears the Alpha Centauri to the silver screen
Been implanted the chip, we listen for the silent scream
??? they like to run test on your teeth
Below the speed of light longer or they'll rip at the seams
Drama to nebula I'll fly to deserts competitor
My poison immune is so deep it don't even register
Plant mutation enslaved anthropological grave
Now we chained my oldest memory dead in Hebrew cave
Slow gravity inside of dominal cavities
Colder than the Nucleus overthrowing the galaxy
North of Tibet  ?ancient valleys? is where the cannibals rest
Molecular units frozen at best with lasers on their necks
Self illuminating I feel the fingers inside my chest
If I die quickly I won't remember my final breath
[Verse 2]
????? are brought to the lead of this suctioning
Seperated from my blood to observe if we keep functioning
Fresh drug replenish our skull with fresh blood
Detect rays in rectums we furnish the next bug
Happy torture clinic they teach you to smile
There is coffins acidic hard to walk and think with all these ??????
Stone wedges oozing fire, meet the great messiah
Never talk with his mouth open just surrounded by fire
This ain't America I'm far from home in a strange place
Glass windows with strange face planetary Melinda gates
Reptilians population exploded
Digital shapeshift watch the eye when it's closing
Grandpa Bush and Hitler they took this brain frozen
Partnered up on Mercedes they built ovens and trained soldiers
Mircoplant to feed us the colonization of Venus
Interex planetary destroying the last semen

[Verse 3]
We need the earh free of this plague just a planet of ???
Surgical E.T fake amputees prolesions
Selective memory units, tubes and nerve switches
2018 that's the ?third? with the bird sickness
I paint pictures while they move us to the prison planes
Federal emergency when they lead us into prison trains
Walk upright and keep his magic in a crows beak
They taught us how to crawl with a chip, we taught em how to love
Technological drugs turning humans to slugs
We breathing methane me and my eses back in the 80s
Missing persons, thieves be taking a thousand a day like babies
Coming down from the stars like Moses in'scription
Exodus 19:16 it was written
Sounds of black trumpets Gods epiphany is forbidden
Unearthly trance, Assyrian tablets lost in the frequencies
Become a ???? ???? lost children of the PleiadesYou might also like1Embed
