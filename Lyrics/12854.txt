Hey Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, I can feel my instincts here for you
Hey now, by my bed for you
Hey now, hey now

[Hook]
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now
[Verse 2]
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, leave it to the wayside like you do
For you, imagination calling mirrors for you
Hey now, hey now

[Hook]
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now, hey now, now
Hey now, now, hey now, nowYou might also like20Embed
