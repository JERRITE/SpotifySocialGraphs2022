Maisie LyricsTell me again how it felt when you left
You said "it wasn’t easy"
Well I hope that’s true cos it was killing me
I’ve had to see everything I’ve ever wanted
Walk away just like that
So how the hell do you expect me to feel now

It’s like I forgot how to breathe
These frail eyes used to see
What I thought was the best of me
And I couldn’t tell you just how much I wanted this
And it hurts just to think about you with him
Oh couldn’t you tell that this is our soundtrack
Like your voice it’s been embedded in my head
And I’ve tried so damn hard to compromise
But I’ll always be the deer in your headlights

Let me tell you just how it felt when you left
I couldn’t believe it
I was annihilated and so destroyed
I’m so pathetic
You took everything away from me
Cos girl you were everything to me

Never had the chance to say how much I wanted this
And it hurts just to think about you with him
Oh couldn’t you tell that this is our soundtrack
To the movie that you’re playing in my head
And I’ve tried so damn hard to compromise
But I’ll always be the deer in your headlights

Cos I’m the fault in all our stars
And it’s my fault we drifted apart
And I thought that you could be
My autumn cos summer almost killed me
You might also likeI wish I could tell you just how much I wanted this
And it hurts just to think about you with him
Oh couldn’t you tell that this is our soundtrack
That I’ve been singing to you in my head
And I’ve tried so damn hard to compromise
But I’ll always be the deer in your headlights

If I could live in Groundhog day
I’d relive the first and the last time
That I spent with you

(I’ve been writing songs to get over you
And I’m not quite sure just how to tell you how I felt when
I thought I had you right where I wanted you)Embed
