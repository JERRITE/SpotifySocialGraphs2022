All My Friends Are Falling In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I took you out at the start of the week
We went for dinner with people like us
I wanted you to think I could be chic
But we went home on the back of the bus

[Verse 2]
I said then maybe you're not on my page
But don’t you worry, you've got to an age
Where you can't do this shit anymore
And then I promised you I’d never felt like this before
[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love

[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love

[Verse 3]
I hear that when people know, then they know
And that you can't even put into words
But then sometimes, you should go with the flow
Because it's ain't always like how you've heard

[Verse 4]
I got too comfortable back at your room
And said "I think that I love you" too soon
You took the do not disturb off the door
And then you looked at me and said you'd heard it all before

[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love
You might also like[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love

[Bridge]
I know that if I was to set you free
You'd let them take you away from me
I know that if I was to set you free
You'd let them take you away from me
I know that if I was to set you free
You’d let them take you away from me
I am an island when you leave me be
Won’t let them take you, take you, take you, take you
Take you away from me
Won't let them take you away from me

[Breakdown]
More and more
All of my friends, yes, all my friends
Are falling in love

[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love
[Chorus]
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling, falling
All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are falling in love

[Outro]
Won’t let them take you away from me
Won't let them take you away from me
Won't let them take you away from me3Embed
