Rumor Mill Lyrics[Verse 1: Tay Jardine, Jordan Eckes]
Here we go again, it’s like you’re
Calling all the shots before I shoot them
And I hate that
Every time I turn my back I wonder what you’ll
Say to make me sound like someone different
It’s not worth it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Tay Jardine]
We’ve been picking up the pieces, leaving all the dust behind
Sick of all the pressure, you’re just wasting time
[Chorus: Tay Jardine]
And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like
To be a shadow of myself
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath
Your made up version of me

[Verse 2: Jordan Eckes, Tay Jardine]
There you go again believing that the truth is what you’re reading
Talk some shit I haven’t heard before
If you’ve got something to say
Don’t wanna talk about it
If you need someone to blame
Go on and cry about it
I measure life in minutes
But these critics think they’ve got me figured out

[Pre-Chorus: Tay Jardine]
We’ve been picking up the pieces, leaving all the dust behind
(We left what wasn’t ours behind)
Sick of all the pressure, you’re just wasting time

[Chorus: Tay Jardine]
And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like
To be a shadow of myself
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath
Your made up version of me
You might also like[Bridge: Tay Jardine]
I’ve lost the strength to keep my grip on the reality
That every thought from day to day is fading from my memory
But I will never let this grow out of my control
And watch your step so you don’t
Fall into this hole you dug alone
This hole you dug alone

[Chorus: Tay Jardine]
And I don’t ever wanna know what it feels like
To be a shadow of myself
And I don’t ever wanna come back down from this feeling
What makes you think that you know what’s better for me?
And I don’t think you wanna see what’s underneath
Your made up version of me

[Outro: Tay Jardine]
Your made up version of me, meEmbed
