Zoo Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a zoo girl
Straight out the Wild Wild East
I’m good, bad, I'm the ugly
I'm a do-gal
Make a dream come true
Wrap an arm round you like a bangal
Keep it hot, keep it humble
Hums to the jungle
Causing a rumble
See me in the rubble of a Hubble telescope
Bringing scope to these heavens (brrrr!)
In my own space
My own fucking race
An alien bringing unity in your face
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your wife
Tell me about your trouble and strife
Tell me why you cry, tell me why you lie
Things you’vе tried and how you stay fly
I'll be therе, not cold like ice
I done already paid that price
[Hook]
Zoo girl
Zoo girl
Zoo girl
Zoo girl
I'ma start a revolution

[Chorus]
I'm humble in the jungle
But I'm wild at heart
When you see me you're in trouble
Gonna light that spot
I'm humble in the jungle
But I'm wild at heart
When you see me you’re in trouble
Gonna light that spot

[Verse 2]
This time I’m gonna have way more bite
Put a voice to the mic, make a beat real tight
I still got fight, I still got vision
I still got sight, my brain's still bright
Running on full or running on a track
Running like a tiger, I’m bringing stuff back
Earn that credit when thing go brat
I'm that bitch and that's that fact
If you want the sauce then I got it on tap
Don't be messing with my blessing when I got it like that
A mind full of traps that’s set for the packs
Clearer than snakes that's hidden in the hatch
Wild Wild East, North, South and West
If you need a rider than ya looking at the best (best, best, best)

Zoo girl
Zoo girl
Zoo girl
Zoo girl

[Chorus]
I'm humble in the jungle
But I'm wild at heart
When you see me you're in trouble
Gonna light that spot
I'm humble in the jungle
But I'm wild at heart
When you see me you're in trouble
Gonna light that spot

[Bridge]

If you did the same enakku enna
Akkala patti kathaikalai
