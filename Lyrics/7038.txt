Just So You Won’t Be Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who am I without your love?
Will I be enough?
Look what you did to my worth, mm
Diamonds they don’t shine so bright
When they’re cast aside
Look what you’ve done to my worth, oh

[Chorus]
‘Cause you’ve got
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone
Bad intentions, with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone
[Post-Chorus]
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone

[Verse 2]
Maybe I’m just as bad as you
And that’s why I can’t seem to let go
‘Cause I kind of like it
Or am I losing sight of me?
Makes me wonder why we mеt
How can two souls like ours connect
Then еasily devastate and dismantle everything we made

[Chorus]
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone
Bad intentions, with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone

[Post-Chorus]
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be alone
Bad intentions with my emotions, oh
Faking affection, just so you won’t be aloneYou might also like1Embed
