Lilo Lyrics[Verse 1]
I needed someone to depend upon
I was alone, I was emotional
Searching for the right emoticon
To expand my mental lexicon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then Gemma told me that she met someone
It was the person I'd been counting on
It felt good, it felt transitional
A feeling I'd been waiting on
[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

[Verse 2]
I saw myself an intellectual
I thought that I was capable
Every move was just habitual
And life was just a ritual

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then Gemma told me that she met somebody
Nobody else could take me from myself
I wasn't searching for it anymore
The feeling I'd been waiting for

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride

Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–

[Chorus]
You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride10Embed
