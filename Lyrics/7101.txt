Smith & Westin Lyrics[Intro: Masego]
Sheriff, sheriff
Someone get the sheriff
They're at it again
And I think one of them wields a weapon

[Chorus: Masego]
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Oh, ayy-oh-ah, ayy-oh-ee
Ayy-oh-oh
[Verse 1: Masego]
Shoot my tongue if you want, lil' mama
I can't talk, say nothin', lil' mama
Love is war if you want, lil' mama
Bust them shot then bring that drama
You wanna fight in public
You got a knife, well, I ain't bluffing
So meet in the middle of town
Where the saloon doors swing left and right
True, right, we gon' fight (Fight)

[Chorus: Masego]
Say hello to the
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Oh, ayy-oh-ah, ayy-oh-ee
Ayy-oh-oh
Say hello to the
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Smith & Wesson, Smith & Wesson
Oh, ayy-oh-ah, ayy-oh-ee

[Verse 2: TeaMarrr]
Nigga, please
I'ma leave you in sorrow
Could it be, I'm like kissing Kate Barlow
Ride out, I'ma get my revenge
Your hideout, buss in, gon' let me in
So meet me in the middle of town
Or wherever the fuck this needs to go down
We gon' fight

She gon' cheat on her own and gon' lose her life
Gon' push me to the edge
Shoot me in the heart, shoot me in the head
So meet me in the middle of town
Where the saloon doors swing left and right
We gon' fight (Fight)
Say h-
Boy, don't make me kick you in your nutsack
I break your saxophone and tell 'em there's no come back (No come)
You wanna cheat, I got receipts from Bunny Ranches (Mm-hmm)
Don't make me squad up with your exes ridin' bareback
No I'm not cappin', watch me kickin' the door with my .44
We not finna argue anymore, I brought the silencer, woah, oh

Sheriff, oh dear (Oh dear)
Oh my stars and garters (Oh my)
He made that choppa sing, that choppa sing
Brr, gat, brr, gat (Sheriff)
Brr, gat (Sheriff), brr, gat (Sheriff)
Gon' push me to the edge
Shoot me in the heart, shoot me in the head
Gon' push me to the edge
Shoot me in the heart, shoot me in the headEmbed
