30,000 Feet Lyrics[Verse 1]
14A, window seat, tennis shoes and faded jeans
Nervous as he tells me it's his first time on a plane
We took off and headed east; I was thumbing through the magazines
He felt like talking and offered me his name
So I asked him how he was
And he smiled and said, "well son."

[Chorus 1]
I've been better, I've been worse
I've chased after pretty girls
Seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side
It seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet
Life's been good to me
[Verse 2]
I've been out a month or so, another night, another show
One hundred different cities, they all just seem the same
He asked me what it must be like, singing songs under the lights
Well, it's got its moments, just the same as anything
I miss my town, I miss my wife
But I'm up here with you tonight

[Chorus 2]
I said I've been better, I've been worse
I have loved a pretty girl
I've seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side
It seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet
Life's been good to me
Good to me

[Bridge]
Sometimes we can get lost living in the here and now
Sometimes it takes the sky to see what's on the ground

[Chorus 2]
I've been better, I've been worse
I've chased after pretty girls
I've seen a couple places that I never thought I'd see
I've walked into harder times, I've walked out the other side
It seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet
Life's been good to me
Good to meYou might also like1Embed
