Can You Afford to Lose Me? Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were my home planet
You were my stars, my holy place
Hmm, but you took me for granted
Right from the start, now didn't you, babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I–
Wish you the best of luck in finding
Someone else who’s strong enough
And I–
This is the only time
I can't be keeping you from fucking up
[Chorus]
So, go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
But once you’re gone, you can't come back
Can you afford to lose me?

[Post-Chorus]
And if you've still got that fire
Then prove it to me

[Verse 2]
I was your life support machine
Didn't you realize it was always me? (Always me)
I was always there to pick up the pieces
When you were a full-blown catastrophe (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I–
Gave you the closest thing you ever had to love
So sober up
And this time (Time)
This is the final time I'll draw the line
I've suffered long enough
You might also like[Chorus]
So, go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
'Cause once you’re gone, you can’t come back
Can you afford to lose me?

[Post-Chorus]
And if you've still got that fire
Then prove it to me, hm

[Bridge]
Can you sleep without me?
Can you breathe without me?
Don’t you need somebody?
Can you? (I need somebody)
Hmm, I wanna know, can you?
Can you sleep without me? (Ooh)
Can you breathe without me? (Can you afford to?)
Don't you need somebody?
Hmm, I wanna know, can you?

[Outro]
Go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
Once you're gone, you can’t come back
Can you afford to lose me?Embed
