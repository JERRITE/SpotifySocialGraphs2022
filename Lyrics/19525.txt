Wonderinâ€™ Why Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Uh huh, uh huh

[Chorus]
Wonderin' why she caught me by the eye
Movin' and pursuin' while she with another man
I'll never let it go
I hope nobody knows
I'ma keep my mouth closed
[Verse 1]
Her favorite past-time is that fast kind
But I got to slow it down, she still recovering from last time
Somehow, we ended up, sun up, with that shine
Bad movie style, it'll never end
My day consists of skirt chasin' women, get baked, go swimming, pushin' the limits
And I'ma go hard until the ground I'm in it (I'm in it)
Get faded, but this'll never fade away
Our game won't have to wait today, despite the clouds, no rain delay

[Chorus]
Wonderin' why she caught me by the eye
Movin' and pursuin' while she with another man
I'll never let it go
I hope nobody knows
I'ma keep my mouth closed

[Verse 2]
She pushed me, I fell right back upon my bed
She's bumpin' with my beat 'cause her heads pressed against my chest
She likes the way I taste, say I'm a good kisser
Took every word right outta her mouth and rolled it up in a swisher

[Verse 3]
We could bend the rules, I could teach ya things
You might regret it but I can do it better than him
Detaching strings, I make her laugh and think
I should probably listen to the words he's singin'
'Cause you should leave him tonight
You bring your girls, I got my guys
And we could stay at my place
It's right down that way
Yeah

Feel her body move slow, tellin' me she won't go
It's another episode (It's another episode)
Steppin' out in the cold in the middle of the road
And I'm far from sober (And I'm far from sober)
Feel her body move slow, tellin' me she won't go
It's another episode (It's another episode)
Steppin' out in the cold in the middle of the road
And I'm far from sober (And I'm far from sober)

[Outro]
That's me playin' guitar, by the way
For all you lil' guys saying we sampling shit
Come on, man
This what she need
