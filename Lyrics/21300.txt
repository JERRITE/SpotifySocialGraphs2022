Everyone’s A Winner Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everyone's a winner
Everyone is free
Everyone's a winner
Except the father and son
Looking down on what I've done
Stepping out on the stage
All the people that I've played
Everyone that I love
Slipping through my fingers
Everyone's a winner
And everyone is free
[Verse 2]
And everything is sacred
Except the church on the hill
And my jagged little pills
Except the clock on the towеr
Above the corridors of power
Excеpt the words on the page
Of your morning paper
Everything is sacred
And every word is true

[Verse 3]
Everything's forever
Except the dog in the chair
In the bedroom that we shared
Except the friends who must choose
Which one of us they wish to lose
Except the bags in the hallway
When the last thing you say is
"Everything's forever
And no one ever leaves"
And everyone's a winner
Except for you and meYou might also like1Embed
