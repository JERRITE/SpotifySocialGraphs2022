I JUST REMEMBERED I HATE YOU Lyrics[Chorus]
I just remembered I hate you
A little too late too
'Cause it's three AM and you're in my bed
I tried my best to erase you
Now you're over at my place and I just remembered I hate you

[Verse 1]
Been here a million times, might take a million more
'Cause you try to change my mind and I try my best to ignore it
But you know exactly what to say and you hit me up when it gets late
When I'm alone, I'm wide awake wishing I had somebody
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's gеt to the part when you're in my apartmеnt
And I'm falling apart in the dark 'cause

[Chorus]
I just remembered I hate you
A little too late too
'Cause it's three AM and you're in my bed
I tried my best to erase you
Now you're over at my place and I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I)

[Verse 2]
I woke up hungover
Did you really come over?
Left while I was sleep and we don't talk about it sober
My head hurts, so I pour myself a drink
Turns into three or four or five, that's when I start to think

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get to the part when you're in my apartment
And I'm falling apart in the dark 'cause

[Chorus]
I just remembered I hate you
A little too late too
'Cause it's three AM and you're in my bed
I tried my best to erase you
Now you're over at my place and I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I)

How could I forget?
Must've lost my head
Should've called your friend instead
How could I forget?
Must've lost my head
Now you're in my bed

[Chorus]
And I just remembered I hate you
A little too late too
'Cause it's three AM and you're in my bed
I tried my best to erase you
Now you're over at my place and I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I)
I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I hate you)
I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I hate you)
I tried my best to erase you
Now you're over at my place and I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I hate)
I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I hate)
I just remembered I hate you (I just remembered I hate you)1Embed
