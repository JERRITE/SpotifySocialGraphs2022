Weâ€™ve Got Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see

[Pre-Chorus]
Why should we worry?
No one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
[Chorus]
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

[Verse 2]
Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searchin' even after today

[Pre-Chorus]
So there it is girl
I've said it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?

[Chorus]
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

I know it's late
I know you're weary (Weary)
Oh, I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely (Lonely)
Both of us lonely (Lonely)

[Chorus]
We've got tonight (We've got tonight)
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light (Turn out the light)
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?
Oh, we've got tonight (We've got tonight)
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light (Turn out the light)
Come take my hand now
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Why don't you stay?Embed
