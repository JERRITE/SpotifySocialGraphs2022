TranslationsEspañol​i hate me too Lyrics[Intro: guccifer]
Notmorgn

[Verse 1]
I'm sad and I'm stressing, but I'm still out here flexing
Mixed emotions, fucked up from the potion
Should I just leave or try to fight it?
Should I bleed out just so you can find me? Just so you can find me
You got a new man, but, bitch, I got 'em diamonds
They're bending fucking light, man
I got a loose grip on life, will you save me tonight?
I got a tight grip on the knife; on the side of my mind, I am taking your life
You said you worry 'bout me, I worry 'bout me too
I wish you were a noose, grab my neck and call a truce
[Chorus]
You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
I don't really fuck with life, I'm just in it for a few
You left me? I wouldn't date me too
I'm a lonely piece of shit, but the money coming soon
You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
You left me? I wouldn't date me too
You left me? I wouldn't date me too

[Verse 2]
Gold in my nose, couple hoes give me dome
Never catch those feels again, I let my guard down at 'em both
Feel your head on my chest
It's been a while, but I still don't know your bed from my neck
Bitch I wanna die tonight
I'm looking at the sky tonight, yeah
(We got things in common
Oh, no, no, no)

[Chorus]
You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
I don't really fuck with life, I'm just in it for a few
You left me? I wouldn't date me too
I'm a lonely piece of shit, but the money coming soon
(You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
You hate me? Well, bitch, I hate me too
You left me? I wouldn't date me too
You left me? I wouldn't date me too)You might also like12Embed
