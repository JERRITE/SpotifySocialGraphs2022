Techniques and Tactics (Original Mix) Lyrics[Intro: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
“665 ways to die. Choose one!”
”Wicked Clowns!”

[Verse 1: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
A mother fuckin’ nine iron, bitch (Fore!)
I said a nine iron, bitch (Way!)
Your brain’s oozed right out the crack in your skull
Where I crack that shit (I smack that shit)
A god damn rattlesnake bite (Sweet!)
Venomous rattlesnake bite (Woo!)
Pit dug in my basement full of ‘em bitches
I do murder right (Yeah!)
A fuckin’ roman candle (Ha!)
Bitch boy, a roman candle (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Light it with a zippo, shove that shit down your throat
Flammable (Flammable)
A hammer and nail
Ordinary hammer and nail (Get ‘em!)
Tie you up in a chair, nail that windpipe shut
You thinkin’ stale! (Ha ha ha!)
[Chorus]
My killin’ techniques and tactics
Keep fillin’ up caskets
You’re mine (You’re mine)
All mine (All mine)
Still chillin’ zipped up in plastic
And kept up as ashes
It’s time (It’s time)
Your time (Your time)

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
A toilet, you bitch (Yeah!)
Yeah, ho, a toilet, you bitch (Get down!)
Load that shit up all week, never flush (Get down!)
Drown your head in that shit
A fuckin’ shopping cart (Huh?)
A Kroger shopping cart
Smoke this much meth, ‘cause I can ‘en beat you
With a Goddamn shopping cart! (Shopping cart)
A Mr. Socko puppet (Ha ha!)
A Mr. Socko puppet (Yeah!)
Southwest strangle you dead in a Mandible Paw
With a one-handed grip (Come on!)
King Kong, mother fucker!
King Kong, mother fucker!
By the time I’m done havin’ fun
You’ll beg for King Kong, mother fucker!
You might also like[Chorus]
My killin’ techniques and tactics
Keep fillin’ up caskets
You’re mine (You’re mine)
All mine (All mine)
Still chillin’ zipped up in plastic
And kept up as ashes
It’s time (It’s time)
Your time (Your time)

[Post-Chorus]
You can’t fight it, be delighted
That you’re bitin' it ever so wickedly
“Mother fucker! You got killed and stabbed!”
My killin’ techniques and tactics
Keep fillin’ up caskets
You’re mine (You’re mine)

[Verse 3: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fire hose, splish splash
Fire hose, splish splash
I won't let that shit blast
'Til it's all the way up that bitch ass
A Desert Eagle 45
Chrome Desert Eagle 45
Beat you brain dead vegetable
With the handle of a chrome Desert Eagle 45
Crazy rapist with AIDS
Crazy gay rapist with AIDS
Pants ya, leave ya tied to a dumpster
In the alley of a gay crackhead hood for days
Catalog order shotgun shells
Catalog order shotgun shells
Wack Majik Ninja catalog in your ears
Are two shotgun barrells
[Chorus]
My killin’ techniques and tactics
Keep fillin’ up caskets
You’re mine (You’re mine)
All mine (All mine)
Still chillin’ zipped up in plastic
And kept up as ashes
It’s time (It’s time)
Your time (Your time)

[Post-Chorus]
You can’t fight it, be delighted
That you’re bitin' it ever so wickedly
“Mother fucker! You got killed and stabbed!”
My killin’ techniques and tactics
Keep fillin’ up caskets
You’re mine (You’re mine)Embed
