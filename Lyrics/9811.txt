North Memphis Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, it's on for the 1-9-9-9
Project Pat in this ho
Putting this ghetto bump in ya speaker
Hypnotize done made it
You know the business ho

[Verse]
Breaking down some reefer, rolling up a sweet-ah
Riding through the street-ah, chiefing like a heat-ah
Reefer got me -nizzoid, object of them blue boys
Searching my vehicle, breath smell of liquor
Mayne it's Project Pattah, player from the sizzouth
Always pack the gat-ahh, gold teeth in my mizzouth
Hustle for the cheddar, tryna make it better
You respect the man or you gets a bloody sweater
Down wit' Paul and Juicy, Hypnotize the label
Ho, go get off my nutsack, and leggo my Eggo
Chopping up a key-ah, riding on twenty-ahs
Don't you wanna be a playa just like me-ah?
Hanging out with killers, creeping on ah come up
Like the ones before me, dog, I'm tryna blow up
I don't give a fizzuck, mane I want that cizz-ap
From yo' baby mama, North Memphis on the mizzap
[Chorus]
North Memphis, North Memphis
Where dem killas hang
North Memphis, North Memphis
Where that work at
North Memphis, North Memphis
Where dem killas hang
North Memphis, North Memphis
Where that work at
North Memphis, North Memphis
North Memphis, North Memphis
North Memphis, North MemphisYou might also likeEmbed
