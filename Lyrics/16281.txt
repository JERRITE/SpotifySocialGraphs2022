Thankful Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I’m just thankful for everything that the Lord has provided for me, even though I have been through a few rough periods in my life
And of course, there will be days where I forget to be thankful
But I need to remind myself and to be reminded that God put me on this earth for a valid reason

[Verse]
Thank you Lord that this year I released a tape
After thinking by doing it again I’d be caught in the bait
Of talking bout girls and drinks and rowdy stuff you do with mates
Fans who want me to rap bout this stuff again they sit and wait
But I can’t go back cos the Lord has changed my heart
I gotta constantly strive to replicate Jesus’ art
But when I fail to do so, I should be thinkin’ smart
By asking for forgiveness and implementing a new start

Fans always askin’ me to perform Life Confession 2
But that version of me now is merely not true
I’m thinkin’ bout deleting it from Soundcloud very soon
But this may mean I’ll lose some fans who stuck with me like sticky spoons

This year I’m very thankful that I did Newstep
By doing it I felt like it was very good prep
For undergrad so now I fully know what to expect
When I do my degree, I hope to take off like a jet

I chose Communication, IT and Vis Com
As my preferences but Com’s likely to be the bomb
Hope to smash it like a gong, insert my skills like CD-ROM
I wanna pass and feel strong, rest in peace to King Von, yeah

Update from LC5, I don’t have my license yet
Failed my test twice so it’s clear from that I lost the bet
That I would get it when I turned 18 I felt upset
When it happened but now I stand back up and reset

However there has been some days where I feel depressed
Cos I don’t have my P’s as I failed my driver’s test
And I just turned 19, and still get round on bus and cab
Or asking mates for lifts if for that I can go and grab
You might also likeAnd I worry that because of this, I might not get a job
For a very long time, and over this I tend to sob
I always wish I could’ve remained at the car wash
But that job just wasn’t to be so I had to give it a squash

But I still wanna be thankful even after going through
These rough times, I wanna stand tall like I’m Vander Blue
Although I don’t have a clue, what the future’s gonna do
I just gotta stay true, to God and he will come through

And I just truly thank God for all the good things that he’s brought
All the times I felt like naught, now those battles have been fought
Even though I will still suffer He will come and bring that colour
To my life when I feel down, feeling like I’m bout’ to frown, yeah

Aye, I’m thankful for the life He’s given me
Living in Australia’s a blessing like a shady tree
But I still pray for those who suffer worse than broken knees
Who ultimately need more necessities and prayers than me, yeah

[Outro]
Okay, here we are, 25th of July
It's the 22nd but I'll just say it's the 25th
Got an ant crawling along the surface
With some particle, don't know what that is
It's a great part of natureEmbed
