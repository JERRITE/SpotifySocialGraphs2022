Hellcats & Trackhawks Lyrics[Verse: Lil Durk]
I remember claiming Dipset (Let's get it)
I had some bitches on my line, I told them bitches get they lips wet (Bitch, get your lips wet)
Lock that door, where them bows at? (Let's get it)
Search for his gun, where his pole at? (Where his pole at?)
We on his ass, where his shows at? (Where his shows at?)
He get away, we on his ass, where he parole at? (Where hе parole at?)
I be hatin' when thеse rappers call these rappers brothers (Brothers)
Only The Family in my eyes, bitch, we got each other (Yeah)
I popped a Perc' and drunk a gallon, man, that hurt my stomach (Man, what?)
Doin' the dash inside the Lamb', that shit had make me vomit (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck from the back, I pull her hair, she screamin' while she cummin' (She cummin')
Got foenem' G-locks, they be clutchin' every time they servin' (Gang)
With all that rah-rah, like you like that, come around, you nervous (On gang)
Sneaky talkin' like you like that, now you actin' turtle (On gang)
Yeah, you ain't like that, you ain't catch a murder
Opps be threatenin' me in my DM, we ain't never worried (We ain't never worried)
Bleed, free Lil Steve, yeah, I call him Curry (Curry)
He be to himself but he'll catch a murder (Catch a murder)
I'm smokin' weed, I don't fuck with dirty (Fuck with dirty)
Can't trust a E, 'cause these bitches dirty ('Cause these bitches dirty)
I feel like Gleesh when I clutch my .30 (Uh)
Get out the streets, bitch, you touchin' thirty (Touchin', uh)
Dski been trappin', he just touched a thirty (Touched a—, uh)
Rich O be cappin' but you know that's brodie (Yeah)
Uh, ayy, Booka put the switch on for me broski (Broski)

I just had a threesome with two thick bitches (Let's get it)
They just suckin' dick 'cause I don't lick bitches (Gang, woo, gang)

Shot in his shit so when he spit, you know he twitch with it
Hellcats and Trackhawks (Let's get it)
They got Timmy on the turn up, finna blast-off (Go)
He wouldn't got caught for that body, took his mask off (Take his mask off)
She a ungrateful lil' bitch, I take her ass off (Take her ass off)
Give me them titties back, bitch
They call my phone like, "Get them glizzys back", bitch
Tell your favorite rapper we ain't feelin' that, bitch
Tell your favorite trapper we ain't hearin' that (Let's get it)
