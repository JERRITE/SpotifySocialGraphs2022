Light from Your Lighthouse Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the sky is filled up
With stones and heavy rain
And trouble starts sliding
Across the way

It's hard for me to see
Which road I've gotta take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind
[Chorus]
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Yeah, let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

[Verse 2]
And when the light is filled up
With storms and heavy rain
And trouble comes sliding
Across my mind

It's hard for me to see
Which road I'm gonna take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind

[Chorus]
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Yeah, let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
You might also like[Chorus]
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on (shine)
Let it shine on (shine)
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

Let it shine on (shine)
Let it shine on (shine)
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on (shine)
Let it shine on (shine)
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on meEmbed
