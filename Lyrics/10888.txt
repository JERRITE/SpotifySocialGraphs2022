Still Have You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shake your head, say "It's mad," you always do
Hold me down, tell me how it's not true
These wings could lift us both, but you don't think so
You are all I wanted, so

[Chorus]
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?
If I tried to hit the brakes, would you see right through?
This ain't the fair-weather love like I'm used to, no
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?
[Verse 2]
Honey-glazed eyes are gazing into mine
Hold me down, say we'll never die
These wings could lift us both, but you don't think so
This is all I wanted to know

[Chorus]
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?
If I tried to hit the brakes, would you see right through?
This ain't the fair-weather love like I'm used to, no
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?
Still have you

[Bridge]
'Cause I feel it turning, the skies are falling
And I need you to need me more than I need you
'Cause I needed answers, you gave me questions
Say there's nothing that you wouldnâ€™t do

[Chorus]
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?
If I tried to hit the breaks, would you see right through?
Is this the fair-weather love like I used to know?
If I threw it all away, would I still have you?

[Outro]
Still have you
Still have you
Would I still have you?
Would I still have you?
Would I still have you?You might also likeEmbed
