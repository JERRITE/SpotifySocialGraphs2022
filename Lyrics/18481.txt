Navigate Me LyricsLeave a message after the sound of the beep

[Verse 1]
I'm creepin' your way and these sheets aren't stoppin' me

And I'm gonna start from your waist up through your navel
And we're approaching such a place

[Pre-Chorus]

This is where emotion flares
This is where we both prepare
[Chorus]
Navigate me through your body
Navigate me
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me through your body

[Verse 2]
I'm creepin' your way and these sheets aren't stoppin' me
Thats right it's quite simply
These sheets aren't stoppin' me

And a mind on a mission

I'm creepin' your way
I'm creepin' your

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You might also likeCause a mind on a mission
With enough ammunition
And the proper position
Is a mind that you just set free

I love the way you talk on top me
So navigate me

[Chorus]

I'm creepin' your way
I'm creepin' your way1Embed
