Where U Goin’ Tonight? Lyrics[Verse 1]
She don't like the rain
She don't like things crashing down
She won't make a play
I bet that I could show you how
Saw her burning on the street (Burning on the street)
The smoke's my testimony (Smoke's my testimony)
Just don't stand so close to me, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
Unless tonight, you'll be my only, my only

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing she got her own way to make things go
All of the things I tried to keep low
Feeling like I been changing
So whatcha doing being a stranger?
Singing I got a ticket, but I can't go
I need a place I can call my home, my home
[Chorus]
Tell me, where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin' tonight)
I'll meet you therе if that's alright (Meet you there tonight, only if that's alright)
Wherе you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin tonight)
Could I be the one to do the things that you like?
Oh
Where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin' tonight)
I'll meet you there if that's alright (Meet you there tonight, only if that's alright)
Where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin tonight)
Could I be the one to do the things that you like?
Oh

[Verse 2]
Burnt all my bridges, hey
But at least I'm staying warm, oh
I been working on forgiveness (Working on forgiveness)
Said I don't think it's catching on (Working on forgiveness)

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing she got her own way to make things go (She got her own way)
All of the things I tried to keep low
Feeling like I been changing
So whatcha doing being a stranger?
Singing I got a ticket, but I can't go
I need a place I can call my home, my home

Tell me, where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin' tonight)
I'll meet you there if that's alright (Meet you there tonight, only if that's alright)
Where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin tonight)
Could I be the one to do the things that you like?
Oh
Where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin' tonight)
I'll meet you there if that's alright (Meet you there tonight, only if that's alright)
Where you goin' tonight? (Where you goin' tonight, where you goin tonight)
Could I be the one to do the things that you like?
