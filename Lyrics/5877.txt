Stars And Boulevards LyricsWait dear, a white horse is walking down my street here
Your words are creeping at my feet
I fear, sunrise will come too soon and you'll disappear
Into the haze of this city and go south

Look out, they're coming after us with big guns
They're only gonna tell you all the bad things I've done
Even if the words they say aren't true, they've won
Now I'm left here dying in the sun

Oh...seems like I'm always on my own
Seems like I'm never coming home
Seems like I'm always on my own
All the stars and boulevards aren't close enough for you
Late nights, won't do me justice
Cause when I drink I just get so damn depressed
And it's, it's not like I ain't trying to get over you
It's just hard to look at all the seasons, pass me over too

And I said
Oh...seems like I'm always on my own
Seems like I'm never coming home
Seems like I'm always on my own
All the stars and boulevards ain't close enough for you

One last phone call from you, it wouldn't hurt much
Just like to hear your voice and pretend to touch
Any inch of you that hasn't said it all or read it all or sung
My life away

And I said
Oh...seems like I'm always on my own
Seems like I'm never coming home
Seems like I'm always on my own
All the stars and boulevards ain't close enough for you
Oh...seems like I'm always on my own
Seems like I'm never coming home
Seems like I'm always on my own
