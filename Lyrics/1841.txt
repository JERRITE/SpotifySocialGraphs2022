A.D.I.D.A.S (All Day I) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see your face when I
Close my eyes
When you’re away I write stories about ya
In my mind
‘Cause this love is one of a kind
All day I

[Chorus]
All day I
Dream about sexing you (Oooh baby)
All day I
Dream about sexing you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
When your lips touch mine
It only confirms what I already knew
I found true love in you
See one time I tried to love
I had my heart broken
I swore that I’d never love again see
But you changed my mind

[Chorus]
All day I
Dream about sexing you (Oooh baby)
All day I
Dream about sexing you

[Bridge]
See the way you make me feel
I just can’t describe it
And I just can’t deny it oh baby
And I know that you want it
Don’t know why you fight it
Oh baby all

[Chorus]
All day I
Dream about sexing you (Oooh baby)
All day I
Dream about sexing you
All day I
Dream about sexing you (Oooh baby)
All day I
Dream about sexing you

Kissing all on your body
All day long I’ve been feening5Embed
