Photosynthesis Lyrics[Intro: Jean Deaux]
Got it, I got it, oh
Say what you're looking for, 'cause I got it, yeah, ayy
I got it, I got it, oh
I got it, yeah

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine
[Verse 1: Saba]
Ayy, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, on the West Side
Still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now
'Cause the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high off of life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine
You might also like[Post-Hook: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)
All the things you adore
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Runnin' through my city like a tour bus
Hopin' one day I can have a tour bus
I can see the planets from my window sill
And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, bet that they'll show up real tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get it in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine
[Post-Chorus: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the things you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

[Outro: Billy Williams]
I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'
Yours truly, Billy Williams25Embed
