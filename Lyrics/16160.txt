The One That Got Away (The Voice Performance) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
You used to steal your parents’ liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don’t have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
I can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa-oh
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
Oh, In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one (The one)
The one that got away
One, one
One, the one that got awayYou might also likeEmbed
