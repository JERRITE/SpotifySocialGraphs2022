â€‹facade Lyrics[Intro: atlas]
Put up a facade
Put up a facade and you saw right
Put up a facade
Put up a facade and you saw right

[Chorus: atlas]
Put up a facade and you saw right through it
Told me I was worthless but I already knew it
I don't care how I die as long as I do it
Don't care how I die as long as I do it
Put up a facade and you saw right through it
Told me I was worthless but I already knew it
I don't care how I die as long as I do it
Please close your eyes, I don't wanna put you through it
At all
[Verse: atlas]
Hair in my eyes, I can't see straight
Drugs in my veins makes me knees shake
Baby, won't you hold my hand while I limp through the hall
Feeling trapped in my mind, need an escape
Every day is just a mess of depressive episodes
Panic in my room over never letting go
Singing songs you've never heard about that seven-letter word
This anxiety gon' place me in the wreckage in the snow

[Bridge: atlas]
I'm tired, so tired all the time
This stress on my back's been severing my spine
No, I'm never doing fine

[Chorus: atlas]
Put up a facade and you saw right through it
Told me I was worthless but I already knew it
I don't care how I die as long as I do it
Don't care how I die as long as I do it
Put up a facade and you saw right through it
Told me I was worthless but I already knew it
I don't care how I die as long as I do it
Please close your eyes, I don't wanna put you through it
