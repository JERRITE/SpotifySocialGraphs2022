Another Park, Another Sunday Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in my room, I'm starin' out my window
And I wonder where you've gone
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin'
It seems to call your name again, where have you gone

[Verse 2]
City streets and lonely highways, I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I'm just tryin' to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into
It's true, I'm lost without you
[Chorus]
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away

[Verse 3]
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky
But I need myself a place to go and hide
I keep it to myself, I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to do

[Chorus]
Another park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to doYou might also likeEmbed
