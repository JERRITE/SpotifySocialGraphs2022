â€‹not a lot, just forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Through your eyes I see
A smile you bring to me
To your joy I tether

[Chorus]
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined sewn together
Like the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever
[Verse 2]
My dog barks wildly
To protect my infancy
From my ex-believer
And I try to calm the wolf
To remind her I am both
Still she tears at my sweater

[Chorus]
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined, sewn together
As the wren sheds her feather
Not a lot, just forever

[Verse 3]
And your dearest fantasy
Is to grow a baby in me
I could be a good mother
And I wanna be your wife
So I hold you to my knife
And I steal your letter

[Chorus]
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwine some together
As the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever

So I bash around the house
And the poison stains my mouth
She comes, I let her
And we share a paradise
And I roll them once or twice
Can't get much better

[Chorus]
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined sewn together
As the rock bears the weather
Not a lot, just forever
Not a lot, just forever
Intertwined, sewn together
As the wren bares her feathers
Not a lot, just forever3Embed
