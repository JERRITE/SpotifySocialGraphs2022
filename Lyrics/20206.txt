TranslationsРусскийEspañol​lonewolf Lyrics[Intro]
お前はもう死んでいる
なに!?

[Chorus]
Better off dead, everything you said
Running through my head, I'm on my own again
Lost another friend, crashed another Benz
This is how it ends, I’m on my own again

[Refrain]
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I'm on my own again
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I'm on my own again
I’m lonely
[Verse]
Now these people actin' like they motherfucking know me
I was in the dirt, didn't hear you saying “homie”
New me going crazy, don't you talk about the old me
Everyone at school started watching from the nosebleeds
Got these enemies, so I do what mama told me, just lemme breathe
Kill myself, yeah, you all tempt me
Rest of you pussies pretending whenever you flexin'
Devil told me to play 21 questions
So Club 27 new member is gettin'
Join it with my Smith and Wesson
Oblivion is what lurks inside the barrel, I'm guessin'
Susceptible to your suggestion
I stress that I live like a no one, but die like a legend

[Chorus]
Better off dead, everything you said
Running through my head, I’m on my own again
Lost another friend, crashed another Benz
This is how it ends, I’m on my own again

[Refrain]
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I'm on my own again
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I’m on my own again
I'm lonely

Shattered skulls with the engine going
From the sky it falls, let it keep on snowing
There's no way of knowing, but the blood keeps flowing
Found you in my dream, see you in the morning
[Transition]
Ничего я не знаю, ничего
Чё ты плачешь?
Почему на меня ты смотришь?
Почему на меня ты смотришь?

[Chorus]
Better off dead, everything you said
Running through my head, I'm on my own again
Lost another friend, crashed another Benz
This is how it ends, I’m on my own again

[Refrain]
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I'm on my own again
On my own again, on my own again
On my own again, I'm on my own again
I'm lonely14Embed
