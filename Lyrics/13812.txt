What It Is Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pretty soon you have to deal
With the truth behind the way you feel
And I'd rather never know
I would do anything, anything
Not to bring who I am to meet me
This useless suffering
Ugly part of me is screwing me
As it feeds me

[Chorus]
But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is
[Verse 2]
Pretty soon you'll have to face
You're a virus called the human race
And Iâ€™d rather never know
I have done everything, everything
Not to feel what it is I'm feeling
This basement devil is kicking the ass
Of my angel on the ceiling

[Chorus]
But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

[Bridge]
Don't push me, don't kill me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't play games, don't mess with
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't ask me, don't tell me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't push me, don't kill me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't run from where you come from
'Cause it is what it is
And I, I

But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is6Embed
