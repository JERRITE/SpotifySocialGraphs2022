A Toast and A Spirit Lyrics[Verse 1]
I ran into a burning room
I didn't know what else to do
I heard you calling me
Heard you calling me, yeah

You pulled me in and locked the door
I fell to my knees and on the floor
Okay, you had me there
Yeah you knew that I care
[Chorus]
Well now I'm a little lost in my thoughts
Can't even imagine the things going through your heart

[Verse 2]
Yeah, a toast and a spirit on an autumn night
Sitting on the steps underneath the dim porch light
And you know
That's not the way that you'd expect it to go

Who'd have ever thought
Who'd have ever have thought
This would ever matter, and it'd ever come down to this
You were the one I wanted to be with

[Chorus]
Yeah but now I'm a little lost in my thoughts
Can't even imagine the things going through your heart

And now you're a little lost in the dark
Well I just wanna know everything going through your heart

[Bridge]
Love, don't lead me where you're going
I can't take it
Love, don't lead me back into those places
I said love, don't lead me where you're going
I can't take it
Love, don't lead me back into those places
I said love, don't lead me back into those places
I know better, won't fall back on you
You might also like[Chorus]
Well now I'm a little lost in my thoughts
Just wishing I could stay to see you out of the dark
But you know there's no telling where you're gonna go
And you know, you know, you know2Embed
