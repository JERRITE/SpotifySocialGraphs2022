Doin Too Much Lyrics[Intro]
Siri play Kash Doll, "Doin Too Much"
Ha, ha
Good job, 1st
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
She like, Kash
Bitch, you doing too much
I'm like shut up ho
Ho you ain't doing enough
Oh, you fucking mad
That's too fucking bad
Since you fucking asked
I like doing too much
[Verse 1]
Look
20 inch heels, like I'm Lady Gaga
Might get Chanel tatted right here on my cha-cha
Big ass titties like I'm Dolly Parton
Living La Vida Loca, like I'm Ricky Martin
Pussy pink, Tesla, I ain't gotta park it
Can't fuck a NBA nigga, if he ain't starting
Huh, period, they like she can't be serious
They see that plane interior, they wanna know who Lear it is

[Chorus]
She like, Kash (Uh)
Bitch, you doing too much (Yeah)
I'm like shut up ho (Ho)
Ho you ain't doing enough (Yeah)
Oh, you fucking mad
That's too fucking bad
Since you fucking asked
I like doing too much

[Verse 2]
I'm obsessed with myself
Bitch, I make love to myself
I put this money over niggas, I'm in love with my wealth
Wear these ghetto ass nails like I'm Flo Jo
Work his balls while I throw it back in slow mo
I just bought a hunnid acres, I might build a mall
My ceilings disappear, I make that bitch dissolve
Got a white billionaire, nigga named Paul
He told me that he love me I ain't got no flaws
You might also like[Chorus]
She like, Kash
Bitch, you doing too much (What?)
I'm like shut up ho (Ho)
Ho you ain't doing enough (Yeah)
Oh, you fucking mad (Yeah)
That's too fucking bad (Aah)
Since you fucking asked (Yeah)
I like doing too much

[Bridge]
Can't pronounce the label you ain't fluent enough
Only want me to turn down 'cause you ain't doin' enough
I count up all these hunnids while I'm doin' too much
Bitch, bitch, pipe down, you ain't doin' enough

[Chorus]
She like, Kash (Bitch)
Bitch, you doing too much (What?)
I'm like shut up ho (Ho)
Ho you ain't doing enough (That's right)
Oh, you fucking mad (Ha)
That's too fucking bad (Aah)
Since you fucking asked (Ha, ha, ha)
I like doing too much (Bitch)
[Outro]
Look (Bitch, pipe down)
Bitch, you need to let that jealousy ball off your muthafuckin' shoulder 'cause guess who gon' be doin' too much?  (Bitch, pipe down)
Me, bitch that's who
And guess who ain't doin' enough?  (Bitch, pipe down)
You bitch, that's who, ha, ha
You ain't doin' enough2Embed
