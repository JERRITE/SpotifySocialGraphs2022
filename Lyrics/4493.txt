BAD FRUIT* Lyrics[Verse 1: Jean Dawson]
I'm just a little volcano in the nighttime
I can see the world burn under my fingertips
I'm just an apple, I'll fall when I turn ripe
Hit the floor hard, I was never picked

[Verse 2: Jean Dawson]
I'm just a little tornado in the sunshine
Click your heels, run on golden bricks
I'm just a little moon runnin' from the sunrise
Make the waves crash, hide behind my only friend
[Bridge: Jean Dawson]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt & Jean Dawson]
I read every sign, on some real shit
But I still trip, over every line
On some real shit, it took a long time for me just to feel this (Oh)
Workin' overtime, fakin' like we're fine
Showing diligence
Actin' like you hard, but you still a bitch (Still a bitch)
Messin' with my mind, what the pills did (Fire)
Niggas press my line, hit the kill-switch (Yeah)
Niggas dyin' in the summertime, but I never trip
It wasn't one of mine, I'm heaven sent
In my mother's eyes, everything I did (Oh)
Kinda undefined, real deal, real spill
Fallin' off the vine when I was a little kid
Livin' off of Vine and Sunset
Some said it wasn't my time
I ain't done yet

I'm a lil' volcano, give me space (Space)
With my hand out the window, ride the wave2Embed
