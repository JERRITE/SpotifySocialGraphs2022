Livin' on the edge (Edge)
Ain't nowhere to run (Where to run)
I don't ever run (Run)
I just road run (Road run)
Goofy little bit' (Little bit')
Good for nothin' slut (Nothin' slut)
She a gentle baby (Baby)
Say I'm just too rough (Too rough)
I gave you a locket (Locket)
Know I got the keys (Got the keys)
Red sink in yellow (In yellow)
But I love the pink (Love that pink)
This mornin' quit the juice (Quit that juice)
I'm right back on the drink (On that drink)
She blow just like a flute (Flute)
And I just think it's kinky (Think it's kinky)
Came from God's rib (God's rib)
Still be raisin' Hell (Raisin' hell)
I know life's a beach (Life's a bitch)
So I bring them shells (Bring the shells)
And these niggas bitches (Bitch)

And I can't go back no more like I got expelled (Uh, uh-uh)
Fuck being broke, slaying hoes to spare myself (Bitches)
But I can't have no jit, hard enough to see myself
