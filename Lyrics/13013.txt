Breaking the Angle Against the Tide Lyrics[Verse 1: Craft Spells]
It’s hard to come around when you feel dead inside all the time
Fear can only leave you feeling heartless inside
So break the angle right between the tide
And call it mine
You’ve wasted too much of my time
Serpentine

[Verse 2: Craft Spells]
In a haunted haze i find it more inclined to stay inside
Finding the comfort in the hurt i can’t put aside
So i break the angle right between the tide
And call it mine
You’ve wasted too much of my time
