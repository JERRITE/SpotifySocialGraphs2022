Peterâ€™s Denial Lyrics[MAID BY THE FIRE]
I think I've seen you somewhere, I remember
You were with that man they took away
I recognize your face

[PETER]
You've got the wrong man, lady, I don't know him
And I wasn't where he was tonight - never near the place

[SOLDIER]
That's strange, for I'm sure I saw you with him
You were right by his side, and yet you denied -
[PETER]
I tell you, I was never, ever with him

[OLD MAN]
But I saw you too - it looked just like you

[PETER]
I don't know him!

[MARY]
Peter - don't you know what you have said?
You've gone and cut him dead

[PETER]
I had to do it, don't you see?
Or else they'd go for me

[MARY]
That's what he told us you would do -
I wonder how he knew ...You might also likeEmbed
