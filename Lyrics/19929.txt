TranslationsTürkçePillowcase Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna come to your party
But I want the invitation
I don't need to hear you say you're sorry
But I need the validation
I really like the feel of being lonely
But I'm desperate for attention
Trust me when I tell you not to touch me
But I'm craving your affection

[Pre-Chorus]
Our chemistry's irrefutable
And I'll love you 'til you die
I'll come to your funeral
But I won't promise to cry
[Chorus]
Spilling teardrops on my pillowcase
My mascara always goes to waste (Always goes to)
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip on my pillow, my pillow case
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip (Drip), drip (Drip)

[Verse 2]
Doctors tell me medicate my heartbreak
But I love to keep it macabre
Tellin' God my problems, solve 'em, answer my prayers
He answered, but the answer was "Nah"

[Pre-Chorus]
Our chemistry's irrefutable
And I'll love you 'til you die
I'll come to your funeral
But I won't promise to cry

[Chorus]
Spilling teardrops on my pillowcase
My mascara always goes to waste (Always goes to)
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip on my pillow, my pillowcase
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip (Drip), drip (Drip)

A reflection on my windowpane
Shows the nightmare (Retsnom)
Call me by my name
What have I?
What have I?
What have-

[Chorus]
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip on my pillow (my pillow) case (Pillowcase)
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip (Drip), drip (Drip)
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip on my pillow (my pillow) case
Drip on my pillowcase
Drip (Drip), drip (Drip)8Embed
