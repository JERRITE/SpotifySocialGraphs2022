Toot That (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
(Damn, Sarge, you made that?)

[Chorus: Erica Banks]
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer (You a dancer)
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome (Ooh)

Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
[Verse 1: Erica Banks]
I told him get back, back up 'less you got them racks up
Ain't no competition, tell them other bitches catch up
Throw it in rotation, make that nigga get up on it, bitch
Do it like you nasty, do it like you own it, bitch
Thick ass, got a lil' junk to it (Junk to it)
Big booty, got a lil' bump to it (Bump to it)
Throw it back quick, he'll run to it (Uh)
Got a lot of ones, he'll run through it, ayy (Okay)
Dump it on the dick like this, uh (Like this)
Dump it on the dick like that, ayy (Like that)
Teasеd how you want, get pleased how you want (Uh)
Drop it down and throw it right back, ayy (Hah)

[Chorus: Erica Banks & DreamDoll]
Ridе on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer (You a dancer)

[Verse 2: DreamDoll]
Big booty got a lil' weight to it
When you see it, better wave to it
I don't do subs, so you better put a name to it
My head so good, get a straw, 'cause I probably get a grape through it
What the fuck a broke nigga thinkin'?
No moolah, no linkin'
Make shit grow, no shrinkin'
Pussy been wet, nigga, let that sink in
Make you wanna call this woman up
Tell that ho good luck
She gon' fuck him like she like him, I'ma fuck him like a slut
Don't you ask me 'bout no prices, every week, they goin' up
He keep askin' how I like it, I said, "Nigga, in my butt" (Dream)
