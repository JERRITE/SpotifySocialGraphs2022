Mystery to Myself Lyrics[Verse]
I don't know why I feel dead inside
I've tried to believe in myself
To love myself
But the truth I know is I can't love who I don't know
And I'm a mystery to myself

[Chorus]
Me on my own, out of control
Everything I touch turns to stone
Me on my own, living a lie
'Cause everything in my life
[Post-Chorus]
Can we talk about it later?
No, I need to buckle down
Need to do it now
Now change my situation
Can we do it, do it later?
No, I need to do it now
Do it, do it now
To change the situation

[Verse]
I don't know why I feel dead inside
I've tried to believe in myself
To love myself
But the truth that I know is I can't lovе who I don't know
And I'm a mystery to myself

[Chorus]
Me on my own, out of control
Evеrything I touch turns to stone
Me on my own, living a lie
'Cause everything in my life

[Post-Chorus]
Can we talk about it later?
No, I need to buckle down
Need to do it now
Now change my situation
Can we do it, do it later?
No, I need to do it now
Do it, do it now
To change the situation
