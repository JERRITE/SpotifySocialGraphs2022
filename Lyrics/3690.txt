Translations한국어Pentagon (Korea) - Dr. 베베 (Dr. BeBe) [English Translation] Lyrics[Intro]
Eh, eh
Love, fall (Eh)
Hurt, and crazy (Eh)

[Verse 1]
Shh! Yeah, that's right
Playing with my heart with your pretty eyes
Gratatata already, catch me
Playing hard to get, baby, your gestures drive me crazy
[Post-Verse]
Please don't fade away, don't leave me
Night that moon falls apart, broken heart
Days after leaving me behind
You'll move on and forget me just like that
Even though I'm in pain

[Pre-Chorus]
What should I do? Oh my, I'm in pain
You are the only one who can heal me
Please come back to me

[Chorus]
Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

[Refrain]
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe

Infinite dreams like the universe I think I heard you calling
But it's not true
Why do I feel severely in pain?
I need you, so please heal me, doctor
We adore and fight, love and hatred, go crazy and so on

[Pre-Chorus]
What should I do? Oh my, I'm in pain
You are the only one who can heal me
Please come back to me

[Chorus]
Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

[Refrain]
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe
[Bridge]
(Please, with me)
Clouds like a picture, calling of a blue dream
(Stay with me)
Melody for you who is hiding in the dark
Yo, don't make an excuse
Yeah, because of the wind
My nostalgia for you is getting stronger and I go crazy
Oh, I awake when you call my name (awake)

[Chorus]
Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

[Refrain]
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe1Embed
