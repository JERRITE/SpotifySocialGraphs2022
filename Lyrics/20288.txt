Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix) LyricsLeave the past behind, just walk away
When it's over, and the heart break
And the cracks begin to show

And the cracks begin to show

Leave the past behind, just walk away
When it's over, and the heart break
And the cracks begin to show
Begin to show [x7]
Leave the past behind
Begin to show [x6]

Leave the past behind, walk away
When it's over, and the heart break
And the cracks begin to show

Leave the past behind, just walk away
When it's over, and the heartbreak
And the cracks begin to show

And the cracks begin to show

Leave the past behind, just walk away
When it's over, and the heart break
And the cracks begin to show
Begin to show [x7]

Leave the past behind
Begin to show [x6]

Leave the past behind, just walk away
When it's over, and the heart break
And the cracks begin to showYou might also likeEmbed
