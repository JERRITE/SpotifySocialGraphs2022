Hope They Love You Lyrics[Chorus]
I hope somebody loves you they way you loved me
I hope they don't call and then you can't sleep
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
I hope that they burn a hole in your heart
I hope that it hurts and you fall apart
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you

[Verse 1]
Man, how's it been six weeks
Guess the waiting didn't fix me
I guess I'll wait six more
Don't know what I'm waiting for
Man, I feel so empty
And I'll move on when you let me
Man, I feel so selfish sometimes
[Pre-Chorus]
I drove to your place at midnight on the I-95
If you wanna let me go thеn goodbye

[Chorus]
I hope somebody lovеs you they way you loved me
I hope they don't call and then you can't sleep
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
I hope that they burn a hole in your heart
I hope that it hurts and you fall apart
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you

[Verse 2]
It's better if we don't speak
I'd rather be lonely
Then looking for answers
I'm taking my chances
I've seen enough of your face
To know we'll never be straight
So hit me when you're older sometime

[Pre-Chorus]
I drove to your place at midnight on the I-95
If you wanna let me go then goodbye

[Chorus]
I hope somebody loves you they way you loved me
I hope they don't call and then you can't sleep
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
I hope that they burn a hole in your heart
I hope that it hurts and you fall apart
I hope that they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, they lo-lo-lo-lo-love you
I hope somebody loves youYou might also likeEmbed
