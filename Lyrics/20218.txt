​feed me to the wolves Lyrics[Chorus]
Feed me to the wolves, leave me on my own
Tell me that you love me even though I know you don’t
Another empty road, love is just a joke
Tell me that you're comin' even though you'll never show
Tell me that you care even though you're never there
The feelings and attraction always seem to disappear
Everything was fake, please just get the fuck away
Don't think that I can do this, I can't take another day, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why everybody always actin' like they know me?
Girl, you broke my heart and left me fuckin' lonely
I be chillin' in my room, I got the lights out
Sun shinin', so I gotta close my blinds now
Why did you do this, why did you leave me alone?
Chilled by myself and I smoked all my dope
So bad for me, hold it in till I choke
Stuck in your ways and can't seem to let go
Can't seem to let go, yeah
Can't seem to let go, yeah
And tell me you changed
But it's still just the same and I still feel the pain
[Bridge]
It's still just the same, no
No, you never change, yeah
It still feels the same, yeah
Because you never change, yeah

[Chorus]
Feed me to the wolves, leave me on my own
Tell me that you love me even though I know you don’t
Another empty road, love is just a joke
Tell me that you're comin' even though you'll never show
Tell me that you care even though you're never there
The feelings and attraction always seem to disappear
Everything was fake, please just get the fuck away
Don't think that I can do this, I can't take another day, yeah

[Verse 2]
I give what I got, but you don't give a fuck
I'm so done with this shit, in my mind, I just run
And the things that you did, it just turned me so numb
I don't feel a thing and I think that I'm done
All the times you would tell me that I should just quit
I would just keep it going, it is what it is
Wanna write music, but there's just a block
I feel so alone, know you don't give a fuck
You don’t give a fuck, please don't say that you do
I chill by myself, I might cry in the booth
I think of the times it was just me and you
I think of the times it was just me and you
You might also like[Refrain]
Just me and you, yeah, yeah
It was just me and you, yeah
And now I'm all alone, yeah, yeah
And now I'm all alone, yeah

[Verse 3]
So I guess this the end, you were my only friend
I don't know how to cope, think I need to be alone
'Cause you don't think of me, but I always think of you
You tell me that you love me but I know it isn't true
Baby, I'ma go, think that this is done
Cancel every plan and I'll just avoid the sun
This ain't meant to be, baby, that is just the truth
You don't feel a thing, please don't tell me that you doEmbed
