So What Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody plays the fool
There's no point in wondering why people do what they do
It's alright to be confused
But don't lose sight of the truth
Girl, it's him, it's not you

[Chorus]
So what if he don't call when he's supposed to
So what if he don't care
So what if when you cry, he don't hold you
You don't need him to be there
So what if when you're mad he says you're crazy
You just make him insecure
No, you didn't lose the girl you used to be
You just let yourself get a little hurt
[Post-Chorus / Drop]
But so what
So what
So what
It happens to the best of us
So what
So what
So what
It happens to thе best of us

[Verse 2]
And you don't have to be ashamеd
For giving everything you got when they don't know what they have
Sometimes jumping ain't so safe
But when the parachute don't open, girl, don't feel so bad

[Chorus]
'Cause, so what if he don't call when he's supposed to
So what if he don't care
So what if when you cry, he don't hold you
You don't need him to be there
Oh, oh, oh
So what if when you're mad he says you're crazy
You just make him insecure
No, you didn't lose the girl you used to be
You just let yourself get a little hurt

But so what
So what
So what
It happens to the best of us
So what
So what
So what
It happens to the best of us1Embed
