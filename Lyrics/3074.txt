SWEAT (Remix) LyricsVERSE 1 (TYPE 1 DIABOLIC)
Fill your lungs, get that air and fill your lungs
Push it good, flow with blood, sir then you’ll feel the flood
Hit the brakes, hear it thud, sir then you kick the crud
Fresh new start, call it art, clean slate free the dove
Gain some speed, gas it up, just remember spread the love
Need some help, got the love, you already got the love
Fill the needs, skip the drugs, sir then you’ll feel the love
What is love? When you see past the ceilings up above

HOOK (TYPE 1 DIABOLIC)
Better yet, when you’re set, solely focused on what’s next
You’re a vet, you’re the best, when you make your body sweat
Better yet, when you’re set, solely focused on what’s next
You’re a vet, you’re the best, when you make you’re body sweat
