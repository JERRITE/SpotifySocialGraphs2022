Only One King Lyrics[Verse 1]
As a boy, always knew I'd
One day have the courage to be king
Time flew and I grew up
Now I'm ready for the promise that it brings
You only wanted me to screw up
But that's something that you're never gonna see
Everything that you hoped for
It was only in a dream
Now I go on a roll on the road
And I know that I'm never breaking down
I control all the flow in my soul
Pull the sword out the stone in the ground
She always said it'd be someday
Seeing castles in the clouds
And one way or another
When I step in the room, everybody better bow
[Pre-Chorus]
So be careful how you talk to me

[Chorus]
'Cause there's only one king
And there's only one crown
And there ain't enough room for us both on the throne
It's about to go down
So you better start running
So you better start running
So you better start running
Because I'm coming right now
'Cause I'm coming right now

[Verse 2]
Huddled masses talk in whispers
Situation's getting tenser
You should probably pay attention
Boy you know I'm born to win it
Ever since I had the vision
When I speak, my people listen
We could start a new tradition
All the children, men and women
Gather 'round to burn it down
We gon' start the kingdom from scratch
Far too many may take advantage
But it ain't gonna happen like that
Time and time again I wake up and
Enemies might attack, but
All that matters in my opinion
Is that the dynasty lasts
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So be careful how you talk to me

[Chorus]
'Cause there's only one king
And there's only one crown
And there ain't enough room for us both on the throne
It's about to go down
So you better start running
So you better start running
So you better start running
Because I'm coming right now
'Cause I'm coming right now

[Bridge]
There's only one king
And there's only one crown
And there's only one king
And it's looking like me
So you better start running
So you better start running
So you better start running
So you better start
So you better start

[Chorus]
'Cause there's only one king
And there's only one crown
And there ain't enough room for us both on the throne
It's about to go down
So you better start running
So you better start running
So you better start running
Because I'm coming right now
'Cause I'm coming right now
[Outro]
I'm coming right now
I'm coming right now
I'm coming right, coming right
'Cause I'm coming right now1Embed
