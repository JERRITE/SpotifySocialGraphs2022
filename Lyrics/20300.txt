Cash in your weekend treasures (Treasures, treasures)
For a suit and tie, a second wife
Now I'm not saying that you could've done better (Better, better)
Just remember that I, I've seen that fire alight

[Chorus]
Tell me, do you, tell me, do you still remember feelin' young?
Tell me the truth, tell me, do you still remember feelin' young
And strong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people?
Just for tonight, look inside and spark that memory of you
Strong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people
[Post-Chorus]
Fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless

[Verse 2]
Now if happiness is always measured
By the life you design, that car on the drive
Then you should feel better than ever
But you know as well as I, it's all lies

[Chorus]
Tell me, do you, tell me, do you still remember feelin' young?
Tell me the truth, tell me, do you still remember feelin' young
And strong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people?
Just for tonight, look inside and spark that memory of you
Strong enough to get it wrong in front of all these people

[Post-Chorus]
Fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless
Fearless, fearless

[Outro]
