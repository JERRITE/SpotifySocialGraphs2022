Yeah, you and I fell in too deep
Love, hate, no in between
Too little, too late for us, oh-oh
Those dimples on your face
Don't work the same these days
It's clear we've both had enough, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: HRVY]
You think it's my heart you're holding
You still think you're all that I need, yeah yeah yeah
I know we're fire and ocean, yeah
You ain't got nothing on me
[Chorus: HRVY]
I don't need your love
If you're waiting for a comeback, hold on
I don't need your love
If you think I'm gonna come back. I won't

[Post-Chorus: All]
I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it
I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it

[Verse 2: Renjun, Chenle]
찰나의 반짝임
이제는 바래진
추억은 먼지 같아, oh-oh
걷잡을 수 없이
우리의 시간은
이제는 끝이 났어, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jisung, Renjun]
기억은 더 흐려지지
널 보던 내 눈빛까지, yeah yeah yeah
바람이 머물지 않듯, yeah
그대로 널 지나쳐

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it
I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it

[Bridge: Jeno, Jaemin]
Ring ring, ring ring
부재중 전화 또 부재중 전화
12시 12시 반 2시 또 2시 반
스트레스 받아
미치겠어 제발 너 땜에
잠을 못 자
지금 도대체 뭔 생각으로
이러는 거야 no, don’t say it
네가 아니라도 지금 내 옆엔
기댈 데가 많아
I don't want to go back
[Chorus: Renjun, HRVY, Chenle]
I don't need your love
If you're waiting for a comeback, hold on
I don't need your love
아마 그런 일은 없을 거야

[Post-Chorus: All]
I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it
I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
Don't need it

[Outro: HRVY, Renjun, Chenle]

Don't need it

Don't need it
Don't need it, need it, no
