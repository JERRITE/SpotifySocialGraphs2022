My Angel (Never Leave You) Lyrics[Intro]
Damn, you know, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be
You can't run from love
This is how I found my baby again
Bobby

[Verse 1]
When I first met you I had these deep feelings
I knew that you could be the one
Then back in grade school cause then on the school bus
We were young but just having fun
Must have been destiny
Now that we're older and we've found each other again
I've learned a lesson that love will find you if you just let it in
[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, God put us together
Forever, my angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
My angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming
Cause this love we have is so real
Cause when I saw you again
I didn't really know how you would really feel
Every time that we make love, it feels like the very first time
I've learned a lesson that love will find you, because it's so divine

[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, God put us together
Forever, my angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
My angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you

Never leave you, I'll die for you (I'll die for you)
Never leave you, never leave you (I'll die for you)
I live for you baby (yes I do yeah)
Never leave you
Never leave you, I'll die for you (I'll give my life for ya)
Never leave you, never leave you (I'll die for you)
Never leave you, never leave you

[Verse 3]
You're my better half
All I needed was you to come back in my life
I love you more than I've ever loved before, you I'll sacrifice
I'll go and sing if you ever leave
Right now you're all that I know
We become one, I feel what you feel
I'll protect you, I will protect you baby (oh, yeah, yeah)
I'll never leave you

[Chorus]
I'll never leave you, God put us together
Forever, my angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
My angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
Forever, my angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
My angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
Forever, my angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for you
Never leave you, God put us together
My angel
Never leave you, you're my best friend
And it's to the end, I'll die for youEmbed
