Yoko Oh No LyricsCan’t believe that it’s over
Nothing makes sense anyway
I know
Let's go!

Yoko
Oh no
Oi Oi Oi Oi

Yoko
Oh no
Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi
Like a bee you leave the sting
Got me disconnected from everything
Like a bruise you crawl inside of me
You really fucked me up this time and I let you

These are the things that should stay
Stay in my head
These are the things that should stay
Stay in my head

Like a bee you leave the sting
Got me disconnected
You really fucked me up this time
And I let you

You really fucked me up this time and I let you
You really fucked me up this time and I let you

Like a bee you leave the sting
Got me disconnected
You really fucked me up this time
And I let you
These are the things that should stay
Stay in my head
These are the things that should stay
Stay in my headYou might also likeEmbed
