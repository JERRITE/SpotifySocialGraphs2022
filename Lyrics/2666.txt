Sound Reasons Lyrics[YL]
Uh huh, it's Triple R shit baby

[Starker]
Yeah, make this money, take this money
Ain't no way you could take this from me
Take that honey, shake that money
Make that- yeah

[Verse 1: Starker]
Yeah yo I'm Harlem shakin' like 2003
Smokin' the rarest of drugs up on the balcony
The blow'll have her ready to fuck
You know my bitches rolling poison ivy
I'm makin' terrible decisions with the boys behind me
My uncle had the whole community before the 90s
You call me grimy, you just pussy, yo I order Chinese
You could find me in my 700 bubble coat
I love to smoke aesthetic butter like I bubble coke I'm on some other shit
From the city back to Cooper projects
You do the knowledge, give me praise and pay the ruler homage
Tommy Bahama, '97 maxes shoes is shinin'
Ya'll niggas rhymin' 'bout promethazine and rude designers
If you my dude yo that's my nigga, yeah we fam forever
400 dollars for the teddy sittin' on the sweater
Get it together my hustle was like the movie Fresh n' that's movin weight like fuckin' sloppy chicks that's heavy settin' who sellin' weapons?
I need Ruben blades and Mack 11's
She threw it back like Moschino son
She threw it back like Moschino son
You know I does it dirty I'm 730 with a pretty bitch that's fuckin' early
Elizabeth Hurley the god
[Verse 2: Mid R Kay]
I rock imported goods similar to what I smoke
She ask me if I got protection like extorted hoods
Music is a drug, please don't snort the hook
This a art, that's a bidness don't distort the books
Westin on the 10th floor fuck a mentor
This the shit I'm in for and we OPEN 24
Send me more liters Don Julio tequila
You a temporary trend like a fresh antiqua
And I'm everlast Cassius Clay gloves
You can never last, you a fake thug
Know I'm sincere chillin' in my new gear
Tired of playin' background this the frontier
What this sound like, nothin's why I'm a pioneer
'Bout time you retire call it Paul Pierce (Hang it up)
Fly women ridin' in that lift line, fuck lines yo [?] online
Fall into line, spring summer's mine
Fall in line bitch, I'm the realest, all time

[Hook: Starker]
Take this money (take this money)
Make this money (make this money)
Take that honey, make that yeah
Make this money (make this money)
Take this money (take this money)
Take that honey, make that yeah

My tongue sharper than a large razor
I want paper, Remy no chaser more rhymes than Walt Frazier
I spit flavor that ya'll could savor
True players, the game is in my nature
Check the DNA my people lost I need to wait
Shorty need some sweet lovin' like Anita Bake'
Pump the brakes, breakfast with the steak in it
I couldn't shed a single tear at my aunt's wake
Does it make me foul? You could me hate me now
I lit the cigarette to think before I'm blazin' out
Peace, peace my pops had the blue jeep
It's young Y on point like the 2,3
Strange details, insane females
She got me tight sayin' that she only eat kale
Took a E-pill, couldn't keep her feet still
Explicit photos that were sent to my Gmail, save 'em
Beats I be lacin' like some new kicks
Got niggas wonderin' like yo "Y who produced this?"
I need to see yo' fuckin' hands touch the roof shit
Yo who's this Y? Aye yo this beat that OPEN 24
Send me four, life's the illest metaphor
Forevermore, niggas talkin' to me like we met before
Shouts to 2Dope, big ups to the editor
In 2016 we in it for the big faces
I'm old school like Adidas with the thick laces
And almost famous like Penny Lane it's all happenin'
Deserve platinum between the block transactions, mad traffic
The radio is all static, bad habits are hard to shake like reputations
No ventilation keep the sour smoke penetratin'
