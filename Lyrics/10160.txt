Nanaâ€™s House Lyrics[Verse 1]
A kiss goodbye, ten to five
Outside of your Nana's house
I'm driving back starry-eyed
Butterfly blues
I count the ways, in seven days
You spun me and I don't know how, but
I'm all alive, I'm all ablaze
I'm all about you

[Pre-Chorus]
We did some beautiful, magical, terrible things tonight
And now it's all over, I know that I've gotta be home
We did some beautiful, magical, terrible things, alright
I'll never forget them, I'll never forget that
[Chorus]
No, I don't know how the whole world changed
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, Annabella, eh
No, I'm dying when I call your name
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterday
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Easy come, easy go
It's one long revolving door
They wander in and wander out
Leaving no trace
The northern line, you caught my eye
I felt like we'd met before
Shake it up, wake you up, leave a sweet taste

[Pre-Chorus]
We did some beautiful, magical, terrible things tonight
And now it's all over, I know that I've gotta be home
We did some beautiful, magical, terrible things, alright
I'll never forget them, I'll never forget that

No, I don't know how the whole world changed
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, Annabella, eh
No, I'm dying when I call your name
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterday

[Bridge]
Annabella, I'm glad I met you
And I'm never gonna forget you
Annabella, I'm glad I met you
And I'm never gonna forget you
Annabella, I'm glad I met you
And I'm never gonna forget you
Annabella, I'm glad I met you
And I'm never gonna forget you

[Chorus]
No, I don't know how the whole world changed
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, Annabella, eh
No, I'm dying when I call your name
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterday
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterday
Annabella, I'm glad I met you
And I'm never gonna forget you
Oh, Annabella, eh
Oh, thanks for yesterdayEmbed
