Gelati Lyrics[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Richard Mille gave my wrist frostbite
Standin' in the traphouse, trappin' in all white (All white)
Blue ball Ferarri, we ain't chop at the red light
Drop on my seat, know I ride with my ID
I can make a famous give shoutouts for IG
Bitch and the boobies tryna go, go for papi
We low-low for body, get smoked like Gelati (Gelati)
Dope out the dollar, we throw the narcotics
Dancin' erotic, got dope in her body
Bought the Bentayga, couldn't do the lil' Mazi (Skrrt, skrrt)
My bitch look like Megan, don't do nothin' but swallow
I call her lil' Kim, drink nut out the bottle
I'm like, "Bitch, go fuck for a dollar" (I'm like—)
I'm too rich, Valentino my collar (I'm like—)
Thick bitch can't take dick, she holler (I'm like—)
Got tricked by the jeweler, she way too hollered
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They checkin' my ink, say they love my graffiti
Gave me two million, I bought me a Visa
Rockin' a mink in Ibiza, I'm watchin' for Peter
I gave the subpoena demeanor
Italy, literally, they can't get rid of me
Millin' in Rome, I roam to Sicily
Try to go big at me, big, is you kiddin' me?
I'm the head niggaty in the vicinity
Blast on my enemies, shit on the industry
Try me, I get you knocked off like the Kennedys
Gorilla like Willie B., cool like a sinner be, shat on this industry, fucked up my image
Negative energy impact my synergy, now I can't buy it unless it's a ticket
12 pulled me over, I tore up the ticket
Niggas be hoes, they whorin' to kick it
Niggas be dissin' and snitchin' and givin' descriptions, then wake up with crickets and fishes
You gon' be found by a fisherman, act like you Gilligan, Gucci, you know I'm a villain
I beat you up mentally, figuratively, physically, I'm tension like insulin, niggas be bitches
I find it sickenin', show 'em no sympathy, no time for friends, I cut off his hands (His hands)

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
Richard Mille gave my wrist frostbite
Standin' in the traphouse, trappin' in all white (All white)
Blue ball Ferarri, we ain't chop at the red light
Drop on my seat, know I ride with my ID
I can make a famous give shoutouts for IG
Bitch and the boobies tryna go, go for papi
We low-low for body, get smoked like Gelati (Gelati)
Dope out the dollar, we throw the narcotics
Dancin' erotic, got dope in her body
Bought the Bentayga, couldn't do the lil' Mazi (Skrrt, skrrt)
My bitch look like Megan, don't do nothin' but swallow
I call her lil' Kim, drink nut out the bottle
I'm like, "Bitch, go fuck for a dollar" (I'm like—)
I'm too rich, Valentino my collar (I'm like—)
Thick bitch can't take dick, she holler (I'm like—)
Got tricked by the jeweler, she way too hollered

Look, went around the corner, might order me a mink (Brr)
Diamonds set ghost, fifteen hundred for a teeth
If the table been full, how the fuck you gon' eat?
Chains VS1, car CTS-V
If you keep it P, then there's money in the street (Ms)
Worth like a couple Ms, they'll murder for you me
I was in the Lamb' truck with a thirty on the seat (Pff)
Two bands for Chanel, that's a 'bow on my feet
She a real freak, she'll slap it on the cheeks (Hey)
She a down bitch, she'll set you up for free
Take it to the wrong hood, they'll find you in the trees
Half a bird on me now, I don't work at Hattie B's (Uh)
Spend a bag now, turn my bitch Patek pink
Add a condo on the collar, Gucci shipped from overseas
Cuban turned my neck froze, diamonds super low degrees (Bling)
Call me Money Making Walk 'cause I make this shit with ease
All VVS stones, boy, we come from EBT (Yeah)
I ain't go to BET (No), I was posted in the streets
With a diamond AP, havin' Richard Mille dreams
'Member Bugle Boy jeans, now it's 'Miri with Supreme
It don't take much for my clique to get seen
Old head from the island said I'm doin' my ting
Spent sixteen just to buy my ring
I don't shoot no ball, I don't play for no team
BigWalk like Kareem
[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
