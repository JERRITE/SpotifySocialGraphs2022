Hit The Scene Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, huh? Huh?
Yeah, yeah, huh? Hahaha
Yeah, yeah, huh? Yeah

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Gucci shoes on my feet, when I hit the scene, I'm drippin’
We killin' everybody, bitch, I can't leave a witness
Shootin’ at that nigga mama, we gon' spare the children
I just copped a brand new llama, shoot it 'til it's empty
Pow, pow, on the scene, shoot the opps 'til they drop, drop
24 shots hit his ass with a shot clock
Couple blunts in rotation, bitch, this is a hotbox
Ridin' round with hot Glocks, tryna pop a nigga top
[Verse 1: White $osa]
Only want big dollars, no assist, can't take no dimes (No dimes)
Know these bitches love me, they get wet just from my rhymes (Wet, wet)
Fuck me for my icy watch, lil' hoe, get off my top (Get off my top)
Been killin’ all these rappers, that’s just one too many crimes, uh
Slide in the space coupe, NASA, woah, ice on her neck on Alaska, froze
All in your girlfriend camera roll, feelin' too fly like Dasah, woah
They wanna see me down (Down), lil’ bitch I won't go down (I can't)
Now I'm on the road out of town, they hate that I’m up right now
Lil' groupie be callin' me dumb, go ape in the booth like I'm Kong
Can't chase me a bitch, I want funds, that shit too bad for my lungs
Ravioli my sauce, and Ralph, that's my hoodie, if they ain't got money they can't even book me
Y'all bitches be blowin' not even that boujee, I just want the top, let the gang have your coochie

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Gucci shoes on my feet, when I hit the scene, I'm drippin'
We killin' everybody, bitch, I can't leave a witness
Shootin' at that nigga mama, we gon' spare the children
I just copped a brand new llama, shoot it 'til it's empty
Pow, pow, on the scene, shoot the opps 'til they drop, drop
24 shots hit his ass with a shot clock
Couple blunts in rotation, bitch, this is a hotbox
Ridin' round with hot Glocks, tryna pop a nigga top

[Verse 2: NLE Choppa]
Clutchin' my tool, I'm ready to clash out, just like 2K, make a nigga lag out
All of that talkin', you showin' your ass now, hittin' your pockets, I'm runnin' your stash now
Scammin' and rappin', we want all the fetty, countin' up green, it's comin' like lettuce
Big gas on the low, we pull up and sell it, my mouth on zip, you know that I'm jealous
Steppin' to me, he must be on drugs, as soon as I see him, hit him with a slug
Don't fuck with no hoes, I can't show no love, do dirt on my own with me and my glove
Whoop a nigga ass, he was talkin' too tough, up the Glock, 50 round, I'ma leave a nigga stuck
You know I'm untouchable, I can't be touched, try to rob me, better try your luck
Glizzy got a beam and the bitch got a penis, hit him with the heat like he livin' in Phoenix
I'm out of this world, I'm livin' on Venus, I pour up the 4s, I love to be leanin'
Up the Glock on who? I'ma hit a nigga 4 times, Glock 23, leave a nigga with no mind
Finessin' the city, I feel like I'm 2 Chainz, shoot him in the back, leave him with no spine
How you gon' rob a robber? Burberry collar
Hollow tips hit a nigga, make a nigga holler
Condom on my dick, baby, I don't need no toddler
You know I'm Jamaican, I'm hangin' with them shottas
