Push Comes to Shove Lyrics[Intro]
Does it seem cold in here to you? Ah man
What's there to do tonight? Anything?
Give me another cigarette over here
Is there anything left in that bottle?
Yeah, give it here man, over here
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Some people live apart;
They break your heart so damn easy
And then one night in stunning victory
She decides and you agree, she's leaving
[Refrain]
Will you ever be the same?
Will you ever be the same?

[Chorus]
That's when push comes to shove
I believe it was inevitable
That's when push comes to shove
Could this be the one that got away?

[Verse 2]
I get the message, guess I knew it all along
Says "You're a stranger here in paradise, you fool"
Seems like forty days and forty nights
Since someone used my first name
Including you

[Refrain]
Will you ever be the same?
Is this the one that got away?

[Guitar Solo]
Push, shove
Push, shove
Push, shove
Push, shove
Push, shove
Push, shove

Now I'm ahead of the game
Driving me insane
Ah, it was a small change
Ooh, I'm just a pushover
Over and overEmbed
