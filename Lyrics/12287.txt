Comfortable Liar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Broad is this sea
The salt enters the wound
My take on you is simple

[Pre-Chorus]
So heal your fear
To heal your fear

[Verse 2]
Time spent waiting off shore
The calm before the storm
My take from you is simple
[Pre-Chorus]
So heal your fear
To heal your fear

[Chorus]
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're such a comfortable liar
You're so calm

[Outro]
'Cause I said wrong
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar
You comfortable liar!
