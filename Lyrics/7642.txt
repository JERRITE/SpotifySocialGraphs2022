CAN’T TOUCH THIS Lyrics[Intro]
(Who made this shit, Pharaoh?)
BIA, BIA
(IRocc on the beat)

[Chorus]
No stylist, I don't do repeats (Frrrttt)
I got money, bitch, I'm knee-deep (Cash)
All hunnids, drippin' in CC (Sheesh)
Might pop that pussy like FreakNik (FreakNik)
No mileage, boy, you can't touch this
No bodies, boy, you ain't fuck shit (You ain't fuck shit)
I'm on islands, whippin' them Porshes
Run shit, and your nigga endorse it (Ayy)
No stylist, I don't do repeats (Ayy)
I got money, bitch, I'm knee-deep (Cash)
All hunnids, drippin' in CC (Woo)
Might pop that pussy like FreakNik (Woo)
No mileage, boy, you can't touch this (Can't touch this)
No bodies, boy, you ain't fuck shit (You ain't fuck shit)
I'm on islands, whippin' them Porshes (Skrr)
Run shit, and your nigga endorse it (Sheesh)
[Verse 1]
Ah, can't touch this (Oh)
My bitches, we be on that fuck shit
Heard a nigga that's hatin', disgustin' (Ew)
Only thing I burn is that clutch, bitch (Skrr)
Like, uh, roof missin', ooh
Glizzy on me, so don't push it, ooh
He just wanna pay for my pussy
I gotta keep from eatin' my goodies (Ah)
Freek-A-Leek, ride slow 'til their knees are weak (Knees are weak)
Wrist rocky, you see the peaks
Diamonds lookin' like Easter week (Frrrttt, cash)

Hot, hot
BIA, BIA

No bodies, boy, you ain't fuck shit (You ain't fuck shit)

And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
Spendin' his money, so I make a little more (Cash)
I can tell by your dress, we ain’t at the same stores
It's a button you press to lift up the door
Tints on fire, so you know I'm a whore (Oh)
Icy, big purr, Pooh Shiesty
Gucci bags don't excite me (Excite me)
Only broke bitches don't like me
Got no time to waste 'cause it's pricey (Cash)
