Seven Days in the Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a friend, her name is Laura
We took a holiday, seven sweet days in Majorca
We took a plane, flew to southern Spain
To see the ocean waves blue
We sat and watched the moon as crickets sang back cover tunes
Way back in May

[Pre-Chorus]
Seven days in the sun
Yeah
[Chorus]
She's my heaven
She's a spark, yeah yeah
Feels like heaven
So light me up

[Verse 2]
She's got this friend, his name is Paula
He likes to cross dress every Friday night in clothes from Prada
We took a train, left behind the rain
To see the summer sunset glow
But now she's not around, I'm hanging on with broken hands
Way above the clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
Seven days in the sun
Seven days in the sun
Sun

[Chorus]
She's my heaven
She's a spark, yeah yeah
Feels like heaven
So light me up

[Post-Chorus]
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You reallyâ€”

Staring through the crowd
It's pulling me underground
And who's gonna dig me out?

[Bridge 2]
We used to take a walk on velvet sands across the beach
We used to build a fire and stare into the rising heat
You used to set me free, lift me from the concrete sea
Seven days in the sun

[Chorus]
She's my heaven
She's a spark, yeah yeah
Feels like heaven
So light me up

[Post-Chorus]
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You really light me up
You blow my mindEmbed
