As We Lay Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back
The hands of time

Yes, we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away
[Verse 2]
It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face
A new day brings reality that
We must go our separate ways

What a lovely night we had (yeah yeah)
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we'd cause
As we slept the night away

[Chorus]
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay (Mhm, hey hey)
As we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
(Oh no, no no no, no no no, no)

[Verse 3]
It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye, baby
You're leaving me
I know you got to hurry home to face your wife (Whoa-oh-oh)
You might also likeI would never want to hurt her, no
She would never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

[Bridge]
I would never, never want to hurt her, no no
She'd never understand
You belonged to me for just one night
As we slept the night away

[Chorus]
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay (Mhm, oh oh)
As we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
(Oh no, hey)

[Outro]
We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second
In the minute
In the hour
Hey hey, hey, as we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
It's morning
(It's morning)
It's morning
(It's morning, ooh ooh)
It's morning
It's morning
It's morning1Embed
