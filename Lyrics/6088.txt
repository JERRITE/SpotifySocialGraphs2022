Puerto Rico Lyrics[Chorus: IDK]
Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine, sometimes Miami
When it rains, it pours like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close the door, bed or floor
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you

[Verse 1: IDK]
Mm, she wanna ride that thing to the top of the pole
Throw a couple dollars, make her get it and go
From the front, from the back, from the side, do it face-to-face
Understand I'm a free agent but I'm yours today (Uh-huh)
Single like dollar like radio play (Uh-huh)
For the rate of your head, I promise I'll stay (Uh-huh)
Gotta switch up the station like ànda-dale (Uh-huh)
Single like uno, no dos or no tres
[Pre-Chorus]
She a five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip
Five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip

[Chorus: IDK]
Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine, sometimes Miami
When it rains, it pours like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close the door, bed or floor
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you

[Bridge: IDK]
You know what, you know what
You know, you know
We like to party, party, party
You know what, you know what
You know what, you know what
We like to party, party, party
We like to party, party, party, party, party
You know what

[Verse 2: Lucky Daye]
Only rolling with a slider
I'ma pull up, you should roll up, get the lighter
Put it on me nice and slow
Mixing drinks up with tequila, she a fighter, I light her fire
Anything goes, two at a time, they finding twins, they Geminis
And they keep switchin' sides, mm, not surprised (Okay)
She already know that her problem's always tellin' lies
We over-analyze, I see it in her eyes, I know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
She a five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip
Five-star bitch, when she ask, I don't trip

[Chorus: IDK]
Girl, you're just like Puerto Rico
Sunshine, sometimes Miami
When it rains, it pours like London
Ooh, your looks can be deceiving, thought I knew ya
Close the door, bed or floor
I just want more, I can't get enough of you
What I got in store, it's all of yours
I just want more, I can't get enough of you2Embed
