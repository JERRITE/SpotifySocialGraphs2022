Thick and Thin Lyrics[Verse 1]
Late night, your eyes fell to the floor
I'm trying to make sense
But you're losing your patience
Hands talk, won't stop, we go to war
In the heat of the moment
You think that we're broken

[Pre-Chorus]
I could see my whole life with you baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
'Cause you're
[Chorus]
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love if you can leave me for
Something so innocent?
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
(Oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Can't sleep, can't eat
My mind's a mess
What are you thinking?
You were happy last weekend
All the good times
How'd you forget?
I was your best friend, yeah
Remember when you said

[Pre-Chorus]
You could see your whole life with me baby
Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
'Cause you're

[Chorus]
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more
But was it really love if you can leave me for
Something so innocent?
Is this the end?
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)

Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything
Said you'd be there for me through everything
Said that you'd have my back with anything

[Chorus]
Now you're out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more (Love no more)
But was it really love if you can leave me for (Leave me for)
Something so innocent?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)
Out the door, just one mistake
You say you're not in love no more (Oh-ooh)
But was it really love if you can leave me for (Oh-ooh)
Something so innocent?
Is this the end? (Oh-ooh)
Thought you'd be there through thick and thin (Oh-ooh)

[Outro]
Said you'd be there for me through everything (Thick and thin)
Said that you'd have my back with anything (Thick and thin)
Said you'd be there for me through everything (Thick and thin)
Said that you'd have my back with anything (Thick and thin)18Embed
