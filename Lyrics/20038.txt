Dyinâ€™ Slowly Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Late night feelin' like a killa'
When my heart start thumpin' then you might get a rise from it
Humans still fuckin' with my feelings
But it's okay I'ma kill 'em so don't you be surprised
And I'm still dyin' slowly
Let the bullets hit the minds and the souls fly away
Get away, don't act like you know me
Niggas acting like dogs with the 9's and the K's
Late night feelin' like a killa'
When my heart start thumpin' then you might get a rise from it
Humans still fuckin' with my feelings
But it's okay I'ma kill 'em so don't you be surprised
And I'm still dyin' slowly
Let the bullets hit the minds and the souls fly away
Get away, don't act like you know me
Niggas acting like dogs with the 9's and the K's
[Verse]
Kill everyday, die everyday
Sacrifice lambs for the goat of our days
Satan still sippin' on the tears of the young
And the old still here but they cry everyday
Smilin' whenever there's torture
I be prayin' against evil forces
Think I'm loosin' my brain, if you ask me I'm sane, if I tweak then that's highly unfortunate
Pray to God I don't go down that course, yeah
Never show your hand but it's okay 'cause I'm the dealer
Adjective flame and the noun Godzilla
Don't play bout mines fuck with me and I'ma kill ya
I'ma send 7 shots from 16 niggas
I'ma send extra to make sure we did 'em
Came wit' the flow that still splittin' yo ceilin'
Angels are knockin' the monsters are kickin'
Back against the wall and don't like this feelin'
Up-up the ante, still fallin' still slippin'
Far from the finish, but I'm closin' distance
Stuck in the world with the Muslims and Christians
My blood, not my blood and white people crippin'
Blow the whistle, they ain't fair
They be wastin', all this time to spear
I'ma put the truth all in the air
While these people talk about my hair
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'm late night feelin' like a killa'
When my heart start thumpin' then you might get a rise from it
Humans still fuckin' with my feelings
But it's okay I'ma kill 'em so don't you be surprised
And I'm still dyin' slowly
Let the bullets hit the minds and the souls fly away
Get away, don't act like you know me
Niggas acting like dogs with the 9's and the K's2Embed
