Retrovertigo Lyrics[Verse]
Before you advertise
All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights
To your blight
Time-machine
While I'm dulled by excess
And a cynic at best
My art imitates crime
[Pre-Chorus]
Paid for by
The allies
So invest

[Chorus]
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning
But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo

[Bridge]
A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed

[Pre-Chorus]
Sell the rights
To your plight
And you'll eat
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual
