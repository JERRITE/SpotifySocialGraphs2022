Permanent Red Lyrics[Verse 1]
Norms get severed and storms get weathered
I let fake shit fly like porcelain feathers
That means I don't so keep copacetic
You do drugs 'cause it's cool, you just cope for aesthetic
I've been battling demons like a deacon in church
And I'll be gone off the deep end 'til I'm deep in the dirt
There is a sumo tsunami inside of my soul
I think I tried every vice tryna clog up that hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it swirl, let it swirl, let it swirl in my head
Too my rage for my agе, I see permanent red
Lеt it swirl, let it swirl, let it swirl in my mind
Keep it spinnin', keep it spinnin', I swear that I'm fine
[Chorus]
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl

[Verse 2]
Smoothie of my moods, they blend in together
Treat the trauma with the trance, I don't mention it ever
That means look out 'cause I'm manic I may
Play you like a puppet just because I'm havin' a day
I've been tickin' and tockin' like a grandfather clock
And I'll be sick until I am just a phantom, I'm lost
There is a vicious volcano inside of my soul
I think I tried every vice tryna clog up that hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it swirl, let it swirl, let it swirl in my head
Too my rage for my age, I see permanent red
Let it swirl, let it swirl, let it swirl in my mind
Keep it spinnin', keep it spinnin', I swear that I'm fine

[Chorus]
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl
Just let it swirl

Too much rage for my age, I see permanent red
Too much rage for my age, I see permanent red
Too much rage for my age, I see permanent red
Too much rage for my age, I see...
Just let it swirlEmbed
