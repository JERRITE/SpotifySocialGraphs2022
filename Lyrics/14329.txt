Please Be Kind Lyrics[Verse]
A fly with no wings goes across the floor
I get the hearing of sugar it just needs more
I wanna send love letters in the middle of the night
But I can’t sleep with all this light

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like it was, i really like it
In the morning too, I got a feeling
I wanna stay where the water's warm
[Chorus]
You’re on my mind
So, darling please be kind
Yeah, you're on my mind
So, darling please be kind

[Verse]
I should've known before we started
Would you do anything if you knew it would lead you brokenhearted?

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the pieces are on the floor
I really like it
I put them back together 'cause I need more
I got a feeling

[Chorus]
You’re on my mind
So, darling please be kind
Yeah, you're on my mind
So, darling please be kind

You’re on my mind
So, darling please be kind
Yeah, you're on my mind
So, darling please be kind
You might also likeYou’re on my mind
So, darling please be kind
Yeah, you're on my mind
So, darling please be kind
