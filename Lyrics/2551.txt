Last Time Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walk in the room, I'm a man on a mission
You're standing there and I feel that connection
I break the ice and I ask what your name is
Then I recall that we already did this

Somehow I missed it

[Chorus]
Keep on moving like you did last summer
When the grass was greener and your hair was longer
If you become familiar with another in town
Don't forget about the fun that we had last time around
[Verse 2]
You walk around with a new man, new plan
You think it's over but I'm just getting started
I try to call but you don't ever answer
I'd let you go but you're all that I'm after

Can't you remember?

[Chorus]
Keep on moving like you did last summer
When the grass was greener and your hair was longer
If you become familiar with another in town
Don't forget about the fun that we had last time around

[Instrumental Bridge]
That feels good

[Chorus]
So keep on moving like you did last summer
When the grass was greener and your hair was longer
If you become familiar with another in town
Don't forget about the fun that we had last time around

Keep on moving like you did last summer
(Last time around)
When the grass was greener and your hair was longer
(Don't forget about it, baby)
If you become familiar with another in town
(Last time around)
Don't forget about the fun that we had last time around
