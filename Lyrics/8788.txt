New Sensations Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I'm seeing something that wasn't there before
Feels like I'm walking through an open door
This is a new sensation that you can’t control
We're in a simulation but you’ll never know
Something in my head catching on my breath (Oh woah)
I swear it wasn’t there before
Moving through the air, tangled in her hair
I can taste it on the tip of my tongue, oh woah, oh

[Chorus]
If we only knew we've been chasing highs that take you where you wanna go, go, go
Looking at your eyes as they're rolling back
The feeling will change you, don’t let it escape you
No, no, no
Verse 2
This is a new sensation and you're not alone
Moving through our bodies, waking up the soul
A serotonin drag like something that you'd have
To give out in your own regard
Happiness is there in an atmosphere
When you tune out all the noise in the room

[Chorus]
If we only knew we've been chasing highs that take you where you wanna go, go, go
Looking at your eyes as they're rolling back
The feeling will change you, don't let it escape you

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
(Woah, oh woah) Yeah

[Bridge]
When you're standing all alone
Looking towards the heavens, love
Tracing over the midnight sky, we are one

[Chorus]
If we only knew we've been chasing highs that take you where you wanna go, go, go
Looking at your eyes as they're rolling back
The feeling will change you (The feeling will change you)
Don't let it escape you (Don't let it escape you)

Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah (If we only knew, ooh)
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
Woah, oh woah, a new sensation
If we only knewEmbed
