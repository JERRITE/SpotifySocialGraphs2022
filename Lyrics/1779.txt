TranslationsРусскийNorth Face Lyrics[Chorus]
I used to work at the North Face
Wasting my time just doing nothing
You're on my mind when I'm lonely
Maybe you'll find me in your own way
Searching for you (Searching for you)
Looking for you (Looking for you)
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Praying for you (Praying for you)

[Verse 1]
She likes my face, she brings me joy
She ditched them niggas, don't kiss them boys
I find a way, I make a ploy
I need that figure, yeah, she need this toy
Comes all the way, from Illinois
I've never been, but, I'll learn some more
Her fantasies, my perfect story
Swear she's the one, but, I'm still employed
[Chorus]
At the North Face
Wasting my time just doing nothing
You're on my mind when I'm lonely
Maybe you'll find me in your own way
Searching for you (Searching for you)
Looking for you (Looking for you)
Waiting for you, oh (Waiting for you)
Praying for you (Praying for you)

[Verse 2]
It started with one, and now I'm in love
With every girl that walks inside
I thought I had won, but I'm out of luck
And I walk alone, I love this life
I can't wait to leave, I can't wait to go
This place ain't for me, I know it's time
Look up at the sun, I know I've begun
A whole different world, another lifeYou might also like8Embed
