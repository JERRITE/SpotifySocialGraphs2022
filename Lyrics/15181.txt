Something You Can’t See Lyrics[Verse 1]
Right time to do me wrong
It's coming on, it's feeling strong
I'll be here 'til you're gone, not fucking around
For an unlucky man I got some big demands
Still dunno if I should, but maybe I can

[Chorus]
My imagination gets the best of me
Just a little adulation, something you can't see
[Verse 2]
And when I feel your touch
Lord knows I think too much
It's all I've ever done, I'm better alone
If I could trade my fear or make it disappear
Would I be standing here, a silent alarm?

[Chorus]
My imagination gets the best of me
Just a little adulation, something you can't see
My imagination, so take the rest of me
It's just a little adulation, something you can't see

[Bridge]
Few strange things change my pain
And turn my love to everything
That feels alright
Few strange things change my pain
And turn my love to everything
That feels alright

[Chorus]
Oh, my imagination gets the best of me
Just a little adulation something you can't see
It's my imagination, so take the rest of me
An exaggeration, something you can't seeYou might also like1Embed
