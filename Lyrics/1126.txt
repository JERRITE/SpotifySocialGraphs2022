TranslationsTürkçeSeeing Blind Lyrics[Verse 1: Niall Horan &  Niall Horan and Maren Morris]
I have seen, seen it all in paper dreams
Watched it unfold on the screen
But I never understood
I have heard, have heard you speak a million words
Now you're talkin' to me first
I never thought you would

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
[Verse 2: Maren Morris, Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
I was young, my heart was always on the run
But you make lovin' fun
I never knew it could be
Hey, I see you from a different point of view
Feels too good to be true
I found my missin' piece

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no

[Bridge: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my
When I look into your eyes
It's a sight I can't describe
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, I must be seein' blindYou might also like23Embed
