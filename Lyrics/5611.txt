So Close to Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wouldn't you like to know
Just how I'm doing, it's been too long
This place feels just the same
Old and forgotten, this frozen sand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the fire burns with great desire
As the stories start to flow
And we'll be drinking through memories
And laughing with enemies we made back when we were so young
[Chorus]
As I'm so close to magic, so close to home
Yeah I'm so close to magic, so close to home
[Verse 2]
So won't you take the time
Try to remember, it's only me
It's not hard for me to see
Just how forgotten these days can be

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
