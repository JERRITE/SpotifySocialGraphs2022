My Underworld Lyrics[Verse 1, Jenna McDougall]
What do you ache for
I ache for wonder
Still I wait 'til that place calls
To take me under

But I beg for your mercy, fear it's safer here than below
As I'm losing control I steer my ship into the unknown

[Chorus, Jenna McDougall]
Now we sail into deep blue storm clouds
Overhead now, strangely I feel at peace as I dive into
My underworld, world
I dive into my underworld, world
[Verse 2, Corey Taylor]
Down in these depths
I'm adding up the numbers
Of all I've suffered in past lives
Tied down in the darkness
Finally I begin to learn what I've returned tonight
Time has come to begin again, leave something else behind

[Chorus, Jenna McDougall]
Now we sail into deep blue storm clouds
Overhead now, strangely I feel at peace as I dive into
My underworld, world
I dive into my underworld, world

[Bridge, Jenna McDougall, (Corey Taylor)]
I remember I know this place (I know this place)
So why separate the light from dark? (why separate)
You can't have two without one
We try, but we can't deny (one we try, we can't deny)
What's of the heart

This is where I shed the skin of old beliefs
And I surface as a better me
(Spring blooms after depths of winter)
Spring blooms after depths of winter
So I release and retrieve my courage from my sleeve
You might also like[Chorus, Jenna McDougall and Corey Taylor]
So these deep blue storm clouds
Hold my head now, strangely I feel at peace

[Outro, Jenna McDougall]
As I dive into
My underworld, world
I dive into my underworld, world
I dive into my underworld2Embed
