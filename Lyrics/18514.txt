TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsRoses/Lotus/Violet/Iris Lyrics[Verse 1: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & boygenius]
I have seen your body
And I have seen your beauty
They are separate things
Pretty, pretty, pretty things
But I am in a garden
Tending to my own
So what do I care
And what do you care if I grow?
If I grow
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, boygenius]
Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses
(Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses)
Show no concern for colors of a violet
Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus
(Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus)
Hopes it won't spark envy in your irises

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams & boygenius]
Think of all the wilted women
Who crane their necks to reach a window
Ripping all their petals off just 'cause
"He loves me now, he loves me not"
I myself was a wilted woman
Drowsy in a dark room
Forgot my roots
Now watch me bloom

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, boygenius, Both]
Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses
(Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses)
Show no concern for colors of a violet
Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus
(Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus)
Hopes it won't spark envy in your irises
(Irises)

And I will not compare
Other beauty to mine
And I will not become
A thorn in my own side
And I will not return
To where I once was
Well, I can break through the earth
Come out soft and wild

[Chorus: Hayley Williams, boygenius, Both]
Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses
(Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses)
Show no concern for colors of a violet
Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus
(Lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus, lotus)
Hopes it won't spark envy in your irises

[Outro: boygenius]
(Roses, roses, roses, roses)
(Roses, roses, roses, roses)
(Roses, roses, roses, roses)
(Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses)13Embed
