Pencil Full Of Lead Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a sheet for my bed
And a pillow for my head
I've got a pencil full of lead
And some water for my throat
I've got buttons for my coat
And sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before
I got money in the meter
And a two bar heater
Oh now it's getting hotter
Oh it's only getting sweeter
I've legs on my chair
And a head full of hair
Pot and a pan
And shoes on my feet
I've got a shelf full of books
And most of my teeth
Two pairs of socks
And a door with a lock
I've got food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothin's gonna bring me down

Oh no, woah
And nothin's, no nothin's, nothin's gonna bring me down

[Verse 2]
I've got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I've got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
I'm out and about
So I'm in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
Food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothin's gonna bring me down
And nothin's, nothin's gonna bring me down

[Hook]
Best of all
I've got my baby
Best of all
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and she's all mine
And nothin's gonna bring me down
You might also likeWooo, hoo, hoo

[Hook]
Best of all
I've got my baby
Best of all
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and she's all mine
And nothin's gonna bring me down
She's mighty fine and she's all mine
And nothin's gonna bring me down
She's mighty fine and she's all mine
And nothin's gonna bring me down
Not today... no, no1Embed
