Leave the World Behind (Radio Edit) LyricsLeave the world behind you

Leave the world behind you

People can you hear me?
There is a message that I'm sending out
I've got the answers to all your problems
And tonight I'll be singing it loud
Just surrender yourself to the rhythm
Put your hands up in the sky
Feel the energy deep inside your system
And leave this world behind
Leave the world behind you

Leave the world behind you

Yeah

And leave this world behind

Leave the world behind you

Leave the world behind you

And leave this world behindYou might also likeEmbed
