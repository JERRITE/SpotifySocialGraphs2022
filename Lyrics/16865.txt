Get On Up Lyrics[Intro: K-Ci, Jodeci]
Said it sounds so good to me
You gotta get on up (Get on up)
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (You gotta get on up now)
Say it again, Jodeci (Get on up)
Ooh ho oh oh oh, gotta get on up (You gotta get on up now)
Wait a minute, let me tell you, ha

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Everybody grab somebody
Turn this mutha into a party
Fellas, take your lady's hand
Ladies, go and choose your man
There's no need to be afraid
Friday night, let's all get paid
Positive is the attitude
Negative is not the mood
[Chorus: Jodeci, K-Ci JoJo]
Get on up
(No, no, you gotta get on up)
You gotta get on up now
(Let's say it again, you gotta get on up)
Get on up
(And you can't sit down)
You gotta get on up now
(And you can't sit down)

[Verse 2: JoJo]
Now that everybody's movin'
Everybody in here is groovin'
Everything is alright
The atmosphere is so nice
The DJ is doin' his duty
All the ladies shakin' their booty
And the night is still young
And the party's just begun

[Chorus: Jodeci, JoJo, K-Ci]
Get on up (No, no, you gotta get on up)
And you can't sit down, no, no
You gotta get on up now
And you can't sit down
Get on up (Just get on up)
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now (Hey, oh, oh oh)
Get on up (Just get on up)
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
(You can't sit down for the ladies)
And you can't sit down
Get on up (Everybody just pump your fist)
And you can't sit down
You gotta get on up now
(Oh, ho, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Jodeci, K-Ci, JoJo]
