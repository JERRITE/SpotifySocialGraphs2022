Drinkin’ & Drivin’ Lyrics[Intro: Esham]
Drinkin' and drivn' what'd you say
Drinkin' and drivin' all day
Drinkin' and drivin' where's my keys
Drinkin' and drivin' please

[Verse 1: Esham]
Zoom, zoom, zoom, jumped in the car
I ain't even know that I was goin' that far
I ain't even know that I was goin that fast
Until the red and blue lights got behind my ass
Boys in blue, what the fuck I'm gonna do
Oh shit, damn, I got the brew
Should I try to guzzle it?
Plus I been smokin' purple kush, and they gon' smell the evidence
[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm in the 1977 [?]
All metal, with a lot of power
And I'm mashin' that mother fucker as fast as I can
Down the sidewalk, for innocent women and men
I'm a serial murderer, all in one night
I know the blood on the hood and windshield ain't right
And it's way past my third defense, I'm gunnin' it
Goin' to jail, goin' to Hell for the fun of it

[Verse 3: Esham & Violent J]
Are you serious? (Shit) Fuck the fast and the furious
Swervin' in and outta lanes, dangerously delirious
The girls be like there he is, pushin' that Cordoba
Get your ass out the street before you get ran over
Give me them keys, J Ain't no way
I'm headed down the off ramp, wrong side of the freeway
But friends don't let friends, well then I don't know you then
'Cause I'm with these three bitches and a bottle of Hen
I see the lights behind me, remind me of the stage
I'ma do the best I can to try to land the front page
What if somebody get hurt? Then my mission complete
I'm tryin' to burn up in the fire with my head in the street
I'm all the way livin', mother fuckers against drunk drivin'
Man, mother fucker, my nerves is bad
When the cops pulled me over, asked me why'd I do it
I say don't fuck with me, go fuck with Martha Stewart

When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I ran into a school bus and it burst to flames
But it was parked and empty all the same
I tried to kill myself, I feel guilty from wealth
And the muffler that I drag ain't stealth
Hitchhikers recognize the grill and they run
I'm tryin' to kill someone, I'm tryin' to spill some run
We took a flight to Australia and rented a car
And got drunk and drove it through a titty bar

[Verse 5: Esham & Violent J]
I was in that same titty bar, gettin' a lap dance
This car crashed through the wall, Hennessy spilled on my pants
Before the police had a chance to come inside
I looked at 'em both and said, "Y'all wanna ride?"
Became the best of friends, we murder pedestrians
We get drunk drinkin' drivin', the rest begins
And we wanted by the police and FBI
It don't matter when in your head the death be right
DWI, DWLS
Still pushin' brand new cars, baby, what can you tell us
It should be illegal for the liquor store to sell us this shit
Every week, we in the same shit, fellas
[Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope & Esham]
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')
When they threw me outta the bar (I was drunk)
They threw me into my car (Thinkin')
Somebody 'bout to get bad news tomorrow (Drinkin' and drivin')Embed
