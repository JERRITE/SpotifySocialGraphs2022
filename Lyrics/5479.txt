C’mon People (We’re Making It Now) LyricsSometimes I feel like I can't go on
Nothing in life is turning me on
But I still see clearly, when I see you smiling
You know nothing seems to fit
I couldn't see my way through the shit
When every single second of my waking day
Was thinking of you
Was thinking of you
You never know
That I am alive
And I am alive
I wanna grow
There are many things I can do
Now that I've fallen in love with you
Take my hand, girl, understand me
You can come, too
Come on people, we're making it now (yeah yeah yeah)
Come on people, we're making it now (yeah yeah yeah)
But today I worked it out
You know it's something I can shout about
Someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking
Whenever you go Whenever you go I'm here alone
Where are the things Where are the things That we both know
There are so many things I can do
Just like falling in love with you
Take my hand, now, understand me
You can come here too
Come on people, we're making it now (yeah yeah yeah)
Come on people, we're making it now (yeah yeah yeah)You might also likeEmbed
