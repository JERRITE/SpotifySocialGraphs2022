Do It Like a Dude Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey (J-J-J-J-Jessie J)

[Verse 1]
Stomp stomp, I've arrived
Drop the beat, nasty face, why you looking at me?
Flying, flying, flying, flying through the sky
In my spaceship, I'm an alien tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty sucker
You think I can't get hurt like you, you motherfucker?
[Chorus]
I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like the mandem, mandem, hey
We can do it like the mandem, sugar, sugar, sugar
We can do it like the mandem, mandem, hey
We can do it like the mandem, sugar, sugar, sugar
[Verse 2]
Bang bang (Hey), pour me a beer
No pretty drinks, I'm a guy out here
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling money like a pimp
My B-I-T-C-Hes on my dick, like this
[Pre-Chorus]
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty sucker
You think I can't get hurt like you, you motherfucker?
[Chorus]
I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like the mandem, mandem, hey
We can do it like the mandem, sugar, sugar, sugar
We can do it like the mandem, mandem, hey
We can do it like the mandem, sugar, sugar, sugar
