Bustinâ€™ Out (On Funk) LyricsWell alright you squares it's time you smoked
Fire up this funk and let's have a toke
It'll make you dance and some of everything
Everybody get high, sing

Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
We're bustin' out of this L seven square
Freaks like you and I could never funk from there
We're bustin' out, everybody come along
We're gonna dance on the funk and make love on this song
We're bustin' out and if everyone agrees
Put your hands in the air and sing along with me

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all

Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out

We're bustin' out of this serious joint
It was too square for me, do you get my poin?
We're bustin' out and we're free from the square
We done braided our hair, we don't mind if you stare
We're bustin' out and we don't give a damn
If you don't like our funk then take your stuff and scram

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all
We're bustin' out on the funk

We're bustin out, we couldn't wait
L seven just the letter too damn straight
Now that we're free to communicate

And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out
And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
Bustin' outEmbed
