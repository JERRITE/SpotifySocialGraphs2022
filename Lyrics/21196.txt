Love Is (original version, 1985) Lyrics[Verse 1]
[John Leyden:]
Sometimes I discover
That love isn't other than breaking your heart

[Claire Johnston:]
And a chance 'cause when people who love
One another find love
Only love
Is the hardest part
[John Leyden:] And when tears fall
[Claire Johnston and John Leyden:] And two hearts call
[John Leyden:] And your loneliness
[Claire Johnston and John Leyden:] Leaves you hurtful
[Claire Johnston:]
People who love one another find love
Only love is the hardest part

[Chorus]
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part

[Verse 2]
[John Leyden:]
Someday we'll recover
From all of the things that have torn us apart

[Claire Johnston:]
And a time comes when people
Who thought they were lonely find love
Only love is the hardest part

[John Leyden:] When the moonlight
[Claire Johnston and John Leyden:] Makes your tears bright
[John Leyden:] And the sad refrain
[Claire Johnston and John Leyden:] Says it's midnight
[Claire Johnston:]
People who love one another find love
Only love is the hardest part
You might also like[Chorus]
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part

Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part

Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest part

Love is, love is the hardest part
Love is, love is the hardest partEmbed
