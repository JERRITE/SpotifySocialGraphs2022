Go Krazy Lyrics[Intro]
Who made this beat?
Toodope
Ayy, Marc, what it do?

[Chorus: Yung Mal & King Von]
I close my eyes at night, see the devil
We like the Purge on them niggas, can't let up
We take that gang shit to a new level
I bet that chopper gon' chop, propellor
These niggas run to the cop, they tell 'em
Huh, I guess they don't know no better
Where I come from, we don't talk to a feather
Solid, never gon' leave my brothers
What? I go crazy, huh
Bitch tryna have my baby, uh-uh
New P-80, uh
Bitch sound like an M-80, uh, uh
See, I'm a player, uh
But bitch ain't doin' no playin', uh
And he was lackin'
We hopped out and we just sprayed him, uh, uh
[Verse 1: Yung Mal]
Pull up a hundred deep just like the Navy
Nigga, you pussy, don't try to write an affadavit
Von gon' shoot at your head, not your navel
When it comes down to that smoke, we vape it
I put that baby to sleep like a cradle
I had to stay down, my mama wasn't stable
T-Mobile, I called a hit off the Razr
Backwood fat as a bitch or potato
I get 'em smashed fast, mashed potato
That 'Vette so fast, hit the gas, I'm shakin'
Stop gettin' booked and we go back to takin'
Ain't nothin' nice in my hood, if you pussy, can't make it
Stick to the code, we never gon' break it
Nigga had a sack, went broke, started hatin'
Still trap out that bitch and it's vacant
Stay with that 7.62, American native
Run with that pack and go straight to Decatur
New Glock silver and black like a Raider
These niggas pussy, wear makeup
No birthday, bitch, I got that cake up
Run up that cash, we fuck these hoes later
I ain't been in no gym and my weight up
I done got rich, whole gang on the news

[Chorus: Yung Mal & King Von]
I close my eyes at night, see the devil
We like the Purge on them niggas, can't let up
We take that gang shit to a new level
I bet that chopper gon' chop, propellor
These niggas run to the cop, they tell 'em
Huh, I guess they don't know no better
Where I come from, we don't talk to a feather
Solid, never gon' leave my brothers
What? I go crazy, huh
Bitch tryna have my baby, uh-uh
New P-80, uh
Bitch sound like an M-80, uh, uh
See, I'm a player, uh
But bitch ain't doin' no playin', uh
And he was lackin'
We hopped out and we just sprayed him, uh, uh

I got a callin', huh
I done got used to ballin', huh
Why is you stallin'? Uh
Too rich, bitch, I can't raw it, uh
Oh, you done lost it, uh
This bitch must be from Halsted, huh
And I'm exhausted
12 chased me, almost caught me (They almost caught me, nigga)
I got the gun with the beams, ooh
I left him dead on the scene, ooh
I would shoot niggas for free
Now my niggas shooting for me, uh
They testing my drop when I pee
I'm checking my Glock when I sleep
Versace my shoes, they sneaks, uh
Calvin my drawers, they clean, uh
Blood on his shirt, it's pink, uh
Tooka in the air, it stink, uh
I'm on tour with Meek, uh
I can't do shit for free

[Chorus: Yung Mal & King Von]
I close my eyes at night, see the devil
We like the Purge on them niggas, can't let up
We take that gang shit to a new level
I bet that chopper gon' chop, propellor
These niggas run to the cop, they tell 'em
Huh, I guess they don't know no better
Where I come from, we don't talk to a feather
Solid, never gon' leave my brothers
What? I go crazy, huh
Bitch tryna have my baby, uh-uh
New P-80, uh
Bitch sound like an M-80, uh, uh
See, I'm a player, uh
But bitch ain't doin' no playin', uh
And he was lackin'
We hopped out and we just sprayed him, uhEmbed
