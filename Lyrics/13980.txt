Old Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walking outside labyrinthian
Over cracks along under the trees
I know this town grounded in a compass
Cardinal landing in the dogwood
I keep going over it over and over
My steps iterate my shame
How come every outcome's such a comedown?
Lately afternoon with the shades drawn down

[Pre-Chorus]
I kept saying I just wanted to see you
Saying, "What's wrong with that?"
Needles shaking outlines in a compass
Every outcome's such a comedown
[Chorus]
I knew it when I saw it
So, I did just what I wanted
So, I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it

[Verse 2]
I saw your boyfriend at the Port Authority
That's a sort of fucked up place
Well so I averted my stride on a quick one
He's coming back from going over to your place, huh?
I feel like I could forget about it
I feel like I could mellow out
I don't feel undone in a big way
There's nothing really bad to be upset about

[Pre-Chorus]
But when I thought I was getting better
I woke up on the ground
An appointment or a disappointment
A setback, oh, another comedown

[Chorus]
As if I needed a reminder
Oh, I do only what I wanna
So, I go through with this

Walking out in the nighttime springtime
Needling my way home
I saw Leah on the bus a few months ago
I saw some old friends at her funeral
My steps keep splitting my grief
Through these solipsistic moods
I should call my parents when I think of them
Should tell my friends when I love them

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have gone out a bit more
When you guys were still in town
I got too caught up in my own shit
That's how every outcome's such a comedown

[Chorus]
And I knew it when I saw it
Oh, I did just what I wanted
So, I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it (And I saw it)10Embed
