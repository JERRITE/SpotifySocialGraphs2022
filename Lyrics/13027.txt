â€‹Chinatown Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
Get in my backseat, honeypie
And I'll wear your sadness like it's mine
'Cause it's just good to feel what's been missing
Yeah, it's bad when it's good to always be missing

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
But a girl like you
Could rip me out of my head
Black tears on your cheek
I want them in my bed
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
Because I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow
With a girl like you
My Chinatown baby
Sittin' on the front stoop
Crying out the crazy
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
Because I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow with you, baby
[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that big red light
And take the sadness out of Saturday night
'Cause that's just good to have what was missing
We were bad to be bad, to always be missing

[Chorus: Bruce Springsteen and Jack Antonoff]
But a girl like you
Could rip me out of my head
Black tears on your cheek
I want them in my bed
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow
With a girl like you
You're my Chinatown baby
Sittin' on your front stoop
Crying out the crazy
I'll take you out of the city
Honey, right into the shadow
Because I wanna find tomorrow
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow with you, baby

[Bridge: Bruce Springsteen and Jack Antonoff]
I wanna run
I wanna run
I love to chase every feeling
I wanna run
I wanna run
I wanna run
'Cause I wanna find tomorrow with you, baby
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We don't have to break every dream we've ever known
Running down the hallway
Running up the long road
We don't have to chase everything we've ever made
Running down the hallway (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Running up the long road (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We don't have to break every dream we've ever known16Embed
