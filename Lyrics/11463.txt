Ooh las vegas - 2007 remastered version LyricsOoh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta me
The first time I lose I drink whiskey
And the second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'Cause I think I'm gonna win
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta me
The Queen of spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is a which
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta me
Spend all night with the dealer
Just tryin' to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Just tryin' to get out of bed
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck outta meYou might also likeEmbed
