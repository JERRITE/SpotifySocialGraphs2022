Can I See You Tonight? Lyrics[Chorus]
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?

[Verse 1]
Girl, I really like your style
I really, really like your vibe
Can I see you tonight?
I wanna be in your arms all night
I said, I wanna be in your arms all night
[Chorus]
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?

[Bridge]
Can I see you?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

[Verse 2]
I want to be your friend
I wanna be more than that
I wanna sit next to you every night
I wanna wake up with you by my side
Every day and every night
Will you love me tomorrow?

[Outro]
