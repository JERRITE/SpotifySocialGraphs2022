Light That Fire LyricsWe go the hustler, you’ve got to hustle
There ain’t no time for sleep
Just keep on movin’, do what you’re doin’
You’ve always played for keeps

Ain’t backin’ down no, we goin’ big
Ain’t stoppin’ now, we get after it

Get after it (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
Light that fire (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
Light that fire
Hey! Hey!

For my survival, take down my rival
No I ain’t gonna stop
If I am beaten, I’m not defeated
I fight back to the top
Ain’t backin’ down no, we goin’ big
Ain’t stoppin’ now, we get after it

Get after it (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
Light that fire (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
Light that fire

Put it all out on the line
Give it your all every time
Put it all out on the line
Give it your all every time

Get after it (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
Light that fire (Hey!)
Get after it (Hey!)
