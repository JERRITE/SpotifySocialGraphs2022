Me Without U Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy
(No me without you)

[Verse 1]
Used to be in balance
Without you, I'm shakin'
Not used to that
To feel like that
Didn't know I needed you
But when my heart was aching
Not used to that
[Pre-Chorus]
But there was something missing
Didn't have a clue
I was playing off-beat
Out of tune

[Chorus]
There's no me without you
No me without you
Are you feel- are you feelin' it too?
No me without you

[Verse 2]
You should be so incomplete
Like puzzles without pieces
I didn't see
What we could be
Finally, I understand that you're just what I needed
'Cause now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
That there was something missing
Didn't have a clue
I was singing off-key
Out of tune
You might also like[Chorus]
There's no me without you
No me without you
Are you feel- are you feeling it too?
No me without you

[Bridge]
I didn't know I was lonely
Until you would hold me
Show me love I never knew
I'm no me without you
No me without you
(No me without you)
(No me without you)
I didn't know I was lonely
Until you would hold me
Show me love I never knew
There's no me without you

[Chorus]
No me without you
Are you feel- are you feeling it too?
No me without you
I didn't know I was lonely
Until you would hold me
Show me love I never knew
I'm no me without you
No me without you
[Outro]
No me without youEmbed
