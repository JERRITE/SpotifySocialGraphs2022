The Analyst LyricsI was hopin you'd be open
To controllin my emotions
Just to focus and let you hold em
Deeply seeded, my god has sewn em
I may own em, but i'm copin
With this power to help you notice
That this hour is totally soaked in
A downward kind of motion
I didn't mean to leave you frozen
But the louder my emotions get
The more sound I get to open with
And now I'm getting roped into
Expressin' my connection to these lessons
That sprout from everything sent to me from memory
Lettin' me ponder on the thoughts of crossed plots and soft spots
Im lost on this earth, since birth nothing hurt except the words
That disturbed this turbulent world and it's people
I'm seein' no one is equal, nothing's not evil
Bald eagles reaping oil with the blood of teens
Lookin like they love our screams
Hookin' in their claws like a disease
Cancerous, it manifests this damage left
Sleepin stressed. we're a mess/
Escapin death in measurements of breaths...
Vengeance...
Justice...
Independence...
Loneliness...
Acceptance...
Remembrance...
What is this?...
What is really positive?
How do you determine it?
Circumstantial evidence
Or the actions on the surface? It's
Crazy how this world just is
People that it's furnished with
The knowledge that we're earnin with
Every little step taken
Worded like a furnace and
Every little thing's burnin'
Its all in the head and how you choose to turn it
Servicin' your worthlessness
Nothin' but the earth to kiss
Wormin' through and cursin' it
As if you are significant
Realizing nothing is
Just being the analyst
Dancing through your head to help
Spark a couple questions in
Heaven, individual
Effects are just residual
Hell is self ridicule
On topics too true to fool
You have broken your own rules
Killed yourself with your own tools
Drowned yourself in your blood pools
Lost yourself in your renewal
You will end yourself soon
Home alone stoned
Knowin you won't
Become anything
Except doomed
You might also likePoundin fist
To ground. it is
So loud that its
Resoundin' in
The minds of the
Surroundin kids
Whose mouths have met
The ground you hit
Down with this
Astounding shit
That clouds your brain
And power trips
Rowdiness
The sound of it
Without the lip
And mothership
Fuckin with the normal shit
I was getting bored with it
Can't take any more of it
Ready for the war within?
Torn like an abhorrent stitch
Industrial rhymes you wish you bit
Rap and rock correctly mixed
I hope that you will get the gist
Im not here to take your bitch
Im not here to diss your whip
Im not here to take a hit
Im just here to make a twist
In minuscule minds
That perpetuate the pride
And if you want me to die
Then believe me, thats fine
You may see me with some chicks
You may see me light a spliff
You may see me ridin swift
But my career won't ride on it
Endless in relentlessness
Observant in this etiquette
Pick apart what's meant with this
And know that trends are second
To the rest of everything you noticed
See this is my way of copin' 
Helpin' me to find my focus
Dyin to revive my flow in
Heavy beats. Won't let it go and
My head's only slightly broken
Tryin to just rhyme and fix it
Every time it's back together
I just know there's somethin missin'
Knowledge that will keep me weathered
My mind will supply the talk
Feedin you some food for thought
You can bet its freshly caught
Off the hook and in the pot
Careful because it is hot
Either this or it will rot
Activate your brain, distraught
This insanity I drop
Will make it okay
Make it stop
Don't know why I came to you
It is all the same to you
No need to maintain my mood
I just cannot make a move
Without seein' danger loom
Every fucking way I'm steppin'
I see everything as weapons
Endin' this in painful doom
All I really like to do
Is shake the room
By makin' music go boomEmbed
