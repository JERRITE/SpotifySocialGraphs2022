Yes, Anastasia (Live) [Auditorium Theatre, 15/04/05] Lyrics[Intro]
"Hey everybody, how's it going? Wow... all the way up there! You know, I couldn't be you right now. Because if I were up there, I would be scared that I would fall. Please, don't fall."
Please, don't fall
'Cause I couldn't bear the thought of your bones and your blood
Please, don't fall
I love a red dress, but not tonight
It doesn't go with my peach lavender attire
I need you right where you are
I need you right where you are
Just for a little while
So I ask you if you're feeling suicidal
Could you wait until Sarah Mclachlan plays here in a couple of years?
[Interlude]

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd been through this in 1919
Counting the tears of ten thousand men
And gathered them all, but my feet are slipping
There's something we left on the windowsill
There's something we left, yes

[Chorus]
We'll see how brave you are
Oh yes, we'll see how fast you'll be running, yeah
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia

[Verse 2]
Thought she deserved no less than she'd give
Well happy birthday, her blood's on my hands
Kind of a shame cause I did like that dress
It's funny the things that you find in the rain
The things that you find, yes

[Bridge]
In the mall and in the date mines
In the knots still in her hair
On the bus, I'm on my way down, on my way down
All the girls seem to be there
You might also like[Chorus]
We'll see how brave you are
Oh yes, we'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Oh yes, we'll see how fast you'll be running, yeah
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see, see
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running now
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia

[Outro]
Come along now, little darling
Come along now with me
Come along now, little darling
We'll see how brave you areEmbed
