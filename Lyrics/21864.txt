Letter to my mother LyricsFlowers in a thorn bush and water under the bridge


Our days together are getting colder, even though my heart burns for your love, even though i'm the reason for your pain, but if i were to lose you I would go insane, because you my mother, and i care, you're the reason i've made it this far, why i made it to 16 and three years away from 18, you are the reason for my success and i'm the reason for your stress, because i strive to be the best, but i'm really a damn mess, you made me to be much more, but instead i give you less, i try my best to be the best, the son you could be proud of, but i'm the kid you're frown upon, i lie in far that you will lose all trust in me, but now i dug a hole so deep, its like  i'm trapped in this unfaithful ditch, and i know my life is mistake because my name is jones , but deep down i'm a phillip, and i hope this relationship we have does not fall, but build up..........
