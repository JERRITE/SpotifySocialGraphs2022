Erryday Lyrics[Intro]
T-Raww
Do this shit e'ryday

[Chorus]
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
[Verse 1]
Mozart with the Mulsanne
Most hated with the most chains
I'm polar bear on my ice game
You pointing fingers, someone to blame
I'm sick of shit, nigga, tired of liars
So high, feel like dying
No reparations, no check for slavery
My current location somewhere in Vegas
Man, I hope I make it, hope I make it
God's plan, not even you can save me
King Musa baby, I'm a Musa baby
I need baby like a more baby
Need décor baby, my house amazin'
Went so low like a temptation
Shit gettin' rough, gotta be abrasive
Signs of things, gotta keep a banger
Fuck that, when your end's low, can't trust nobody
My back against the wall, and I don't fuck with nobody
Know somebody caught a body and he haunted, I don't want that
Count your blessings, stop complainin'
Be precision with your aimin', 'cause I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday

Wish you knew somebody, wish you knew that keep it quiet
Ain't new to this island, if you knew me you be silent
Every day that's a new bitch in my face, what you say
Pop that Rollie in my case and my space like NASA sponsor
Pussy monster, chop that nonsense, it get violent 'round my way
It's poppin', better make your mind up, start that engine, need you start us
I'm typically not normal, I ain't atheist, so believe in me
All about my currency, dollar signs and king-ery (T-Raww)
The new Messiah, follow me into your freedom
I can lead you, swear of allegiance
No more pain and grievin'
Suffer long from dreamin'
When I know what's up with me and Wiz Khalifa
But me and Wiz Khalifa smokin' reefer
Then I'm flyin' private to a feature 'cause

[Hook]
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday
I'm making money nigga e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
She making promises e'ryday, e'ryday, e'ryday
I'm sipping somethin' smoking mary jane, mary jane, e'ryday
Kilos of gold on e'ryday, e'ryday, it's payday12Embed
