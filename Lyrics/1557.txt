True Colours Lyrics[Intro: M Huncho]
Baby, we've both grown
Baby, we’ve both grown (Mhh, baby, we've both grown)
Baby, we've both grown
(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey!)

[Chorus: M Huncho]
Baby, we’ve both grown, yeah (Baby, we've both grown)
I'm so used to being alone, yeah (Bein' alone)
Smoke a J' now watch the throne yeah (Watch my throne)
From the top, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone
Your true colours have been shown (Have been shown)
You took my heart as a loan (As a loan)
You took my heart as a loan
I’m alone, I’m alone
[Verse 1: M Huncho]
Two pyrex bowls up on the stove (whip, whip, whip, whip)
My brothers whippin' it with both (whip, whip, whip, whip)
Spend some time just on my own
Needed a little growth (growth)
Baby, we’ve both grown (grown)
Why you acting different with me? You're tryna control ('trol)
I'm in the studio I can’t be playin' Romeo
She's fuckin' with my head, an' I'm just sippin' out of foam
I'm grindin' just till' late, while she's just sitting down at home (down at home)
While shes sittin' down at home I'm in my thoughts (I'm in my thoughts)
Is it her or is it me? Can't be my fault (it ain't my fault)
An' I lie sometimes, but it can't be my fault (it ain't my fault)
An' I lie sometimes, but it can't be my fault

[Chorus: M Huncho]
Baby, we've both grown, yeah (Baby, we've both grown)
I'm so used to being alone, yeah (Bein' alone)
Smoke a J' now watch the throne yeah (Watch my throne)
From the top, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone
Your true colours have been shown (Have been shown)
You took my heart as a loan (As a loan)
You took my heart as a loan
I'm alone, I'm alone

[Verse 2: M Huncho]
I gave it my all and you took it (Took it)
She went through my brain, understood it ('Stood it)
I got a call for a booking, now I'm too busy for her and she know it (yeah, she know it)
When I'm back baby, you better throw it, throw it back on me
I love a call baby yeah
I gotta' leave, she's throwing tantrums saying I ain't shit (I ain't shit)
Can't be fucking with my mansion, she ain't shit (she ain't shit)
My priorities already set straight (yeah, they're straight)
Life is sweet but with her, it's like a cake (like a cake)
I'm elusive and exclusive, can't be fake (can't be fake)
I drive alone and think a lot to set it straight (set it straight)
I've been on rows, going hard up in the plane (Wacka flame)
Yeah I still got the Wacka-Flocka flame (flame, flame, flame, flame)

Baby, we've both grown, yeah (Baby, we've both grown)
I'm so used to being alone, yeah (Bein' alone)
Smoke a J' now watch the throne yeah (Smoke a J then watch my throne)
From the top, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone
Your true colours have been shown (Have been shown)
You took my heart as a loan (As a loan)
You took my heart as a loan
I'm alone, I'm alone2Embed
