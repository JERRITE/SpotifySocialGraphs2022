Break away (piano version) Lyrics"Break Away"
Piano Version
This loneliness is wearing me down
I swear I had it all figured out
When she's kissing me I'm missing your mouth
Reminiscing on the love I had found

Cause she's got your eyes but they don't quite shine
Like the way yours always do
You've been trapped inside of this one track mind
Cause I lost it all in you
And when you finally rest your head tonight
Are you wishing I'm right by your side?

If I could break away
Could you say all the things you want to say?
Oh darling, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need
And if I can follow through
You'll find me standing right in front of you
So tell me, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need, can you save me?

This loneliness will tear me apart
I'm wishing myself back to the start
Cause when I'm holding her feel your heart
And I hope it beats till it leads me back to where you are

Cause she's just not you and he's just not me
Like two strangers in the dark
You've been trapped inside of a story line
Where the pages lost their spark

And when you finally rest your head tonight
Are you wishing I'm right by your side?

If I could break away
Could you say all the things you want to say?
Oh darling, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need
And if I can follow through
You'll find me standing right in front of you
So tell me, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need, can you save me?You might also likeEmbed
