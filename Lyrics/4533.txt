Lovers Anonymous Lyrics[Intro: DOM KENNEDY]
(What up, Uce?) Yeah
Wanna say what's going on
To all my people locked down, keep your head up

[Verse 1: DOM KENNEDY]
I follow the laws of Picasso ever since a snotnose
Double G's on my shirt, my tires skrrt
Subtract that lame, my name you insert
Black leather pants, she dressed exotic
Had the world in my hands, didn't realize it
Found my way to her heart and she fell hostage (Uh)
Trapped in bondage, lover's anonymous
I don't recall your name, to be honest
Was it the DoubleTree or the Four Seasons?
Fairly recеnt, did we order deep-dish?
Did we talk about lifе and how it's all deceiving?
How I started with nothing and I bought the Bimmer? (Bitch)
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I'm so glad that you came now
So keep it up, baby, keep it up, baby
I'm so glad that you came now
You're the one I want, I can't get enough, I
Your soft touch made me wanna see your body
Look you in the eyes and I can tell you like it
You know the boy love when you wear designer
Play around with me, it be hard to find you

[Verse 2: DOM KENNEDY]
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?
You want a Jaguar, shopping sprees for fun?
Big Chanel bags, sunglasses from ads? (Uh-huh)
The large-faced watch? Baby, you know I can
But I'm to another city as soon as the bus come
I gotta pick up dubs, I'll call, you pick up, love
My rap is like five stars, what Punisher once was
The Bronx where it's from, my name weigh a ton
The spirit game remains in every slum
The cars is for fun, we only give 'em ninety-one
I pray that we see great days under the sun
Blue, red and green, you see me, I'm papered up (Bitch)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I'm so glad that you came now
So keep it up, baby, keep it up, baby
I'm so glad that you came now
You're the one I want, I can't get enough, I
Your soft touch made me wanna see your body
Look you in the eyes and I can tell you like it
You know the boy love when you wear designer
Play around with me, it be hard to find you
You might also like[Verse 3: Don Toliver]
I can check you in
I can hit it right here, make you say my name
I can show you how I live, how I kick it out here
You can't play around my head, you know I been what I been
Oh, you love to judge knowing I did what I did
Jealousy in you, I guess it fit the bill
Honestly speaking, I'm tryna keep it real
Sit back and chill (Back and chill), let's cut a deal, oh-oh

[Outro: Don Toliver]
Oh-ohEmbed
