Breaking My Bones Lyrics[Intro]
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars to come down
All of the stars to come down
(Send it)

[Verse 1]
Foxglove to the heartbeat
Online with a clean sheet
Been overloved, lost my touch, punch out and repeat
Short game in the long run
Got spread like a shotgun
Say, "I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine," I'm singing
[Pre-Chorus]
Give it away, give 'em a taste
Yeah, you got nothing to lose
Pick up the pace, put on a face
It's all about you, yeah
It's all about you

[Chorus]
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars to come down
All of the stars to come down
And we fashion our souls
For the likes of a ghost
Want all of the stars to come down
Yeah, all of the stars to come down

[Verse 2]
Let's talk
Happiness or vanity
Where do you find your clarity?
How do you get off? Who do you call God?
Nevermind, just stare at me
Let it kill you then tell all your friends
Pretty people make the pages of the DSM
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Give it away, give 'em a taste
Yeah, you got nothing to lose
Pick up the pace, put on a face
It's all about you, yeah
It's all about you

[Chorus]
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars to come down
All of the stars to come down
And we fashion our souls
For the likes of a ghost
Want all of the stars to come down
Yeah, all of the stars to come down

[Bridge]
Come by, come back, come down, down
Come by, come back, come down, down
Come by, come back, come down, down
Come by, come back, come down, down
I've been breaking my bones
(Come by, come back, come down, down)
I've been breaking my bones
(Come by, come back, come down, down)
[Outro]
I've been breaking my bones
Following ghosts
For all of the stars to come down
All of the stars to come down2Embed
