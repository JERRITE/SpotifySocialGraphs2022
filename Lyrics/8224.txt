Once Again Lyrics[Intro: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
Yeah, ayy, bitch
What's up with that motherfucking mouth?
On God, look
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
Usually do a white Benz, but this black one
Got a bad bitch with a fat one
She like bitches more than me
So on Fridays, we do captions
She like Uzis, not MAC-10's
She like Mac Dre, I like Andre
I'ma ball hard like DeAndre
Need a paycheck like Beyoncé
Not tryna be your fiancé
My sister's boyfriend lightskinned, his name Keyonte
Told him if he hurt her, I'ma hurt him, on my papa (That's on pops)
Pull up to his mama house with that big chopper (Brrah)
[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, forty racks to put that jet in the air (Let's get it)
I'm like fuck it, let me go up on the Snap since I'm here (Turn up)
Put that on my daddy grave, ain't no man that I fear (No)
I ain't talking, when I say, "Clap at his hair" (Go get it)
Niggas showing their true colors, get my Clorox (Get my bleach)
Your favorite rapper chain always in and out the pawn shop (He fucked up)
Fat nigga, make a nigga bitch cook some pork chops
I used to hear shots, now I ain't gotta keep my doors locked (We in the 'burbs with it)
With they baby mama only time they acting tough (Boy, you a bitch)
Heard I had a shootout, ain't nobody died, wasn't us
Can't reach, say you want about them Glock 9's (Baow)
Even if it's slippery, can't let an opp slide (Never)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
In a foreign, yeah, that shit with the frog eyes
Bad bitch, on the 'net she be doggin' guys
I'ma dog that bitch like some leftovers
In a big boy house, call the chef over, bro whip a Range Rover, huh
Look like a lick to say the least
Fifteen thousand on a fleece, blue and red like police
Got a bad bitch with a ten year old son, damn
Nigga half a nigga age, buy a PlayStation
Put him to the side, fuck his mama in the back
Bend her over, hold her mouth
Told her, "Take it like a real bitch," then she went south
Sucking dick like a pro (Like a pro)
Swallow nut like a taste tester on a GoPro (On a GoPro)

Bitch, bought the crib, fuck the bank 'cause I don't want no markings (We gon' cash out)
Yachty still got the money from that one endorsement (That's some M's)
Hellcat, red key, that's too many horses (Uh)
In the club with all Franklins, throwing George's (Catch 'em)
Walking through the airport, hoping they don't call the dogs (Got the bag)
Froze than a bitch, I'm just hoping that I thaw (Ice)
I'm beefing with your mans, here go fifty, take his head off (All twenties)
Bankroll so fucking sloppy, I can't spread it all (Wait, wait, wait)
Who that creeping in the car? They windows down (Who is that?)
That might be bro, he 'posed to pull up with some loud (Ah, he good)
They started shooting, tell them kids go in the house (Bah, bah)
They heard the AR, make them niggas turn around, gang

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Fuck his bitch in a pretty ass nightgown
She get drunk off the Tito's, believe that
Fuck that bitch from the back, grab her weave tracks
Why these bitches want Boat? Mind your beeswax
Make your bitch taste my kids just like D, facts
Put a crease in her back like some work slacks
Pussy wet, got me feeling like a merman
AR's, AK's like the Taliban
Tell a friend, niggas getting money like the Wheel of Fortune
Used to ride around crackin' cards
With no AC, man, that shit was really scorching
Send my bitch, talkin' bout you don't replace the teeth with the Porsche
Now she badder than some old milk
[Verse 6: Tee Grizzley]
Niggas talkin' 'bout what they 'bout to do, ayy (Talking 'bout what they finna do)
Boy we already in motion, ayy (Boy, that ball already rolling)
Fuck with us, we crack that melon, ayy (Fuck with us, we crack that head)
We ain’t aiming at abdomens, ayy (We ain't aiming at your body)
Try me if you feeling heroic, I'm strapped like a Trojan
You know I ain't sparing shit when I start striking, no bowling
He say, "Grizzley, you don't fuck with me," get out your emotions
Blocko'll tell you, 'fore we really got to this shit, we spoke it, nigga
Now them prices is the lowest, ayy (Prices is the lowest)
But them show prices the highest, ayy (Show prices the highest)
Man, my heart probably the darkest, bitch (Heart probably the coldest)
But our ice probably the brightest, nigga1Embed
