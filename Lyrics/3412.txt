OH MY LORD Lyrics[Chorus: Arizona Zervas]
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord"
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord"

[Verse 1: Arizona Zervas]
Should we whip the Benz or the Bimmer? Yeah
VVS chains on freezer, yeah
Shorty live in Beverly like Weezer, yeah
And if she take me home I'ma please her, yeah (Yeah)
Let's go take a ride in the Wraith (In the Wraith)
They be talkin' crazy but wе fine either way (Eithеr way)
I don't give a damn, I'm just tryna get the cake
24/7 with my brothers and we all gettin' paid
Keep it 1K and it's never gon' change
Take you on a date, have you mine in a day
You just say the words and you know I'm on the way
On the way
[Chorus: Arizona Zervas & 24kGoldn]
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord"
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord" (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
Beep beep in the back of the Jeep
I got a shorty that I'm tryna take home, ayy
She peeped, I'm a dog off the leash
Don't be surprised you find me lookin' for a bone
Saint Laurent, it's a Don in your presence (In your presence)
Bust it down, yeah, the crown kinda heavy (Kinda heavy)
In the town, gettin' wild, actin' reckless
If you call, I'll be there in a second
'Cause the wheels on the whip come in stainless (Come in stainless)
And the life that we live kinda dangerous (Kinda dangerous)
Plus that ass that you got hella famous
So let me take you home

[Chorus: Arizona Zervas]
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord"
Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like, "Oh my Lord"
