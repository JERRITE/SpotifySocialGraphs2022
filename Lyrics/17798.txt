Sniper Gang Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky
Gang, gang, gang
Grrt, bah
(Young Troy, you a genius)
Bah, bah, bah

[Verse]
When I get to swerving on 'em, spinning the curb up on 'em
Sending Suburbans on 'em and we lurking on 'em
Ain't no funeral service for 'em (Boom, boom, boom)
I'm on a mission for 'em, Sniper Gang got the vision on 'em (Sniper da blicky da blicky)
Never snitching, go to prison for 'em (Nah)
Hundred round drum, thirty clip is on 'em, blood dripping on 'em
Pussy nigga went against the gang, you know that's a violation (Gang, gang, gang)
Penalty is death, take his last breath
Bullets burning like I'm frying bacon, niggas dying waiting
Never mind the hating, I'm a General, nigga (Blicky da blicky)
I'm about to put an end to you niggas
Niggas fucked your baby mama, spent up all your money
All you did was tell on them niggas? (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
You was with this gang banging (What?), you was tryna be like 22 (Right)
I'm responsible for all you niggas (Blicky da blicky)
I'm the realest nigga, tell the truth (Bah, bah, bah)
And I know I might alarm you, nobody thinks you a Don, Q
Thirty round knocking off a limb, maybe leg, head, plus an arm too
I could look into your eyes, know you never been on a mission
Some niggas be bitch and never really listen
Get put in a ditch and now his mama missing
Might put out that hit and now we gotta get him
We caught us a lick and now we gotta wet him (Blicky da blicky da blicky)
This shit ain't no diss, ain't no Tory Lanez
I pull out that blick and leave no remains
You don't want these Blicky niggas parked inside of Highbridge, look what I did (Blicky da blicky da what?)
Got the ladder hanging out the stick (Come here)
Looking like a high bridge (Where you goin'?)
You could die, kid (Stop runnin')
Fuck Real Ryte, y'all can suck a dick and get killed too
Y'all know damn well who got y'all mans hit
Even Kooda blood'll get spilled too (Pussy)
(Spin the block, nigga, y'all know what it is)
Killing niggas and I rap about it like I'm Melly, nigga (Right)
Ain't no shit that you could tell me, nigga (Right)
Murder on my mind, is you ready, nigga? I'm a deadly nigga
Can't compare my shit to none of these bitch niggas
Not JayDee, not D Sav, and especially not that snitch niggaYou might also like3Embed
