Behind the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sitting in the dark, looking at the TV
8 p.m. news, see 'em all complaining
Watching people hurt, who they’re betraying
Is it as bad as what they say?

[Pre-Chorus]
There is more, so much more than this
There is more that we miss

[Verse 2]
Gotta shine the light a little bit brighter
Open up your heart a little bit deeper
Open up your eyes a little bit wider
We can set our sights a little bit higher
[Pre-Chorus]
We are more, more than this
There is more that we miss

[Chorus]
Just look for the light way behind the moon
'Cause we see the dark side we hide on the inside
Just look for the light way behind the moon
You know we can find it before we're divided

[Verse 3]
Open up your mind, breaking down the borders
Open up your heart, gonna pay it forward
See us as we are, open up the wide view
Get the right news, it might surprise you

[Pre-Chorus]
There are more, more of us (More of us)
There are more we can trust

[Chorus]
Just look for the light way behind the moon
’Cause we see the dark side we hide on the inside
Just look for the light way behind the moon
You know we can find it before we're divided
More

There are more of us
There are more of us
You are one of us

There are more of us
There are more of us
There are more of us
You are one of us

There are more of us
There are more of us
There are more of us
You are one of us

There behind the moon
There behind the moon
There behind the moon

[Chorus]
Just look for the light way behind the moon
'Cause we see the dark side we hide on the inside
Just look for the light way behind the moon
You know we can find it before we're dividedEmbed
