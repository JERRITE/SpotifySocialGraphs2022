MF TRIMM Lyrics[Intro]
(Vibin' out right on the West)

[Chorus]
Vibin' out right on the West
I can't stop 'em from snatchin' necks
Fifty shots gon' touch his chest
C8, no V8, sunset burn tires, I'm ridin' in a 'Vette
Every day, it's a different fit
That forty fit and I came from shit (Top chef)
I'm with Keed, yeah, that pope
Know YSL players, hide your ho
Yeah, it's a habit, 1K on a coat
Go do some numbers and bring in the load
Bitch would've thought I was a swiper the way I use this Visa
Boy, don't lurk like RiRi, work, work, work, yeah, with that Nina (That motherfucker trim)
[Verse 1]
Fuck it, pop a pill, thirty, what it is (That motherfucker trim)
Find out where he live, that Diamondback get kills (That motherfucker trim)
Shooters smokin' morе than zip, Hellcat way past Kim (That motherfucker trim)
Thеse niggas ain't havin' foundation and they don't even know 'bout the dip (That motherfucker trim)
I want no Xans
Fuck it, I want no friends
I just pass these hoes to my brothers, ain't no cuffin' (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Vibin' out right on the West
I can't stop 'em from snatchin' necks
Fifty shots gon' touch his chest
C8, no V8, sunset burn tires, I'm ridin' in a 'Vette
Every day, it's a different fit
That forty fit and I came from shit (Top chef)
I'm with Keed, yeah, that pope
Know YSL players, hide your ho
Yeah, it's a habit, 1K on a coat
Go do some numbers and bring in the load
Bitch would've thought I was a swiper the way I use this Visa
Boy, don't lurk like RiRi, work, work, work, yeah, with that Nina (Big trim)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no simp, boy, you trim
Real big dog, I ain't missing no meals
She bank on a shawty 'cause we get 'em killed
[?][1:27] baby, I'm not [?]
The way I pop out with this shit on, man, this shit too easy (Too easy)
Can't even cap, fuck with that boy, but his help, I'll never need it (No kizzy)
I hit her pussy, then I get her out of here just like her name was Wheezy (Like Wheezy)
They say Armani straight sewn on my pockets, man, this shit too easy (On God)
She wan' massage for a crocodile Birkin, baby girl, come please me (Swear)
Bands for shopping, I hit up Alonzo, he got me away from Neiman (Where you at?)
