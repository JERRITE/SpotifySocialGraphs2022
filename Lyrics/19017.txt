Merciless Death LyricsYou fall before us, shattered in vain
You thrash about us, screaming in pain
Tortured and flaming when you're on your knees
You fucking whores, it's us you must please

We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless death

[Instrumental Break]
Stand up and bang, 'til you fall to the floor
The sound is so deafening, it can't be ignored
The place is burning, your mind's destroyed
Devastated and helpless, you're left here to die

We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless death

[Instrumental Break]

The angel has landed and judgement has come
Your death has arrived, faster than some
The darkness descending upon heaven's gates
Your soul is now promised and you know that we'll wait

We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless deathYou might also likeEmbed
