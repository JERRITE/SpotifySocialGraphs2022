TranslationsDeutschCover Me in Sunshine Lyrics[Verse 1: P!nk]
I've been dreaming, friendly faces
I've got so much time to kill
Just imagine people laughing
I know some day we will
And even if it's far away
Get me through another day

[Chorus: P!nk & Willow Sage Hart]
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine
[Verse 2: P!nk]
From a distance all these mountains
Are just some tiny hills
Wildflowers, they keep living
While they're just standing still
I've been missing yesterday
But what if there's a better place?

[Chorus: P!nk & Willow Sage Hart]
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine

[Bridge: P!nk]
La la la la
La la la la

[Chorus: Willow Sage Hart]
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
