Exceptional Lyrics[Intro]
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got their thing
Something different we all bring
Don't you let 'em clip your wings
You got it, you got it
We're on fire and we blaze in extraordinary ways
365 days
We got it, we got it
[Pre-Chorus]
You can dream it, you can be it
If you can feel it, you can believe it

[Chorus]
'Cause I am, you are, we are exceptional, exceptional
Yeah, I am, you are, we are exceptional, exceptional
"E" to the "X" to the "C-E-P" to the "T" to the "I" to the "O-N-A-L"
From the "E" to the "X" to the "C-E-P" to the "T" to the "I" to the "O-N-A-L"
'Cause I am, you are, we are exceptional, exceptional

[Interlude]
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
C'mon, you got it!

[Verse 2]
Got you checkin' out my swag
Hey, conformity's a drag
It's the essence, not the tag
You got it, you got it
Everybody's got their own kind of crazy
That's what makes you so amazing
I got you, and I know you got me too

[Pre-Chorus]
You can dream it, you can be it
If you can feel it, you can believe it

'Cause I am, you are, we are exceptional, exceptional

[Bridge]
Don't hide your individuality
You are who you wanna be
Don't let anything hold you back
Go ahead and dream it out loud (Dream it out loud)
Be brave, be  proud
It's your turn this time around

[Chorus]
'Cause I am, you are, we are exceptional, exceptional
