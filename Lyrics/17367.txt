Vaccine (Falling Star) Lyrics[Chorus]
Tryna stay focused, I keep drinking this lean
Killers behind me as I’m chasing my dreams, oh Lord
Tryna heal up, a nigga feel like Tyreek
But it’s been too long, realize they permanent scars
Raindrops, they say keep enemies close but I can’t hang with opps
I’m the real definition of a falling star
Walking on tears, running on blood
Don’t take too much, love is a drug

[Verse]
Ayy, walking light, feel like the feds been watching ’cause I just beat the county
Spec too hot, that’s my main lil’ runt, I don’t even hang around him
And we barely miss, it ain’t no rebounds
I was broke, couldn’t drive to school, so I went bustdown
I go put on Palm Angels, I don’t need no handouts
Shawty say she love mе, it’s irrelevant like Bow Wow
Thinking ’bout my futurе like Ciara but I’m higher than a Seahawk
It wasn’t no weight on Slim’s casket ’cause my nigga was ashes
It’s hard for me to sleep at night
We go buy switches for them Glocks, it make it automatic, all I gotta do is squeeze it now
[Chorus]
Tryna stay focused, I keep drinking this lean
Killers behind me as I’m chasing my dreams, oh Lord
Tryna heal up, a nigga feel like Tyreek
But it’s been too long, realize they permanent scars
Raindrops, they say keep enemies close but I can’t hang with opps
I’m the real definition of a falling star
Walking on tears, running on blood
Don’t take too much, love is a drugYou might also like3Embed
