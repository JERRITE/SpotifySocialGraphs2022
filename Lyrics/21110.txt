Iâ€™d do anything LyricsSo, 'ow's it go then Dodger? It's all "bowin'" and "'ats off"...
And "Don't let your petticoats go dangling in the mud
My darling."
Oh, "And I'll go last."
No, I'll go last
If you insist
I'll do anything
For you dear anything
For you mean everything to me
I know that
I'll go anywhere
For your smile, anywhere --
For your smile, ev'rywhere --
I'd see
Would you climb a hill?
Anything!
Wear a daffodil?
Anything!
Leave me all your will?
Anything!
Even fight my Bill?
What? Fisticuffs?
I'd risk everything
For one kiss -- everything
Yes, I'd do anything...
Anything?!
Anything for you!!
'Ere now, Oliver, you just copy
Dodger and I'll help you out with the words, alright?
So it's "I'll do anything"
I'll do anything
For you dear
For you dear, anything
For you mean
For you mean everything to me
Ah, that's lovely
I know that
I'd go anywhere
For your smile, anywhere --
For your smile, everywhere
I'd see
Would you lace my shoe?
Anything!
Paint your face bright blue?
Anything!
Catch a kangaroo?
Anything!
Go to Timbuktu?
And back again!
I'd risk ev'rything
For one kiss -- everything --
Yes, I'd do anything
Anything?!
Anything for you!!
Dance, Nancy
Oh, alright, Dodge. C'mon boys!
Would you rob a shop?
Anything!
Would you risk the "drop"?
Anything!
Tho' your eyes go, 'pop'
Anything!
When you come down 'plop'
Hang ev'rything!
We'd risk life and limb
To keep you in the swim
Yes, we'd do anything...
Anything?!
Anything for youYou might also likeEmbed
