Addict of Magic Lyrics[Intro]
Sing that song will ya?

[Verse 1]
When you leave, I forget how to breathe
I cold sweat and lucid dream through the night
It's messed up 'cause I'm sure I'd hold up the drug store
Just for the high in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not violent, but I'd tear this place apart
Just for a hit of your heroin heart
[Chorus]
Every inch of my body
Every part of my heart
Every corner of my mind
Wants you here when you're not
Because I get withdrawals when
I can't kiss your lips
So come over here, darling
'Cause I can't resist
I'm an addict of magic
And I need my fix (I need my—)

[Verse 2]
I'd sеll my possessions
Lie through my confessions
Brеak up this whole fuckin' band
Yeah, rehab can't save me
And AA just takes me twelve steps away from your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not violent, but I'd break into a car
Just for a hit of your heroin heart

[Chorus]
Every inch of my body
Every part of my heart
Every corner of my mind
Wants you here when you're not
Because I get withdrawals when
I can't kiss your lips
So come over here, darling
'Cause I can't resist
I'm an addict of magic
And I need my fix
You might also like[Bridge]
And I know love as drugs is a worn out metaphor
But we’re all longing for the pure

[Chorus]
Every inch of my body
Every part of my heart (Every part of my heart)
Every corner of my mind
Wants you here when you're not
Because I get withdrawals when
I can't kiss your lips
So come over here, darling
'Cause I can't resist
I'm an addict of magic
And I need my fix

[Outro]
I'm an addict of magic
And I need my fixEmbed
