Angels On My Wrist Lyrics[Chorus]
Angels on my wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist
In the closet watch me dip dip dip dip dip dip dip
I hit the gram now watch me [?]
Angels on my wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist
In the closet watch me dip dip dip dip dip dip dip
I hit the gram now watch me [?]

[Verse 1]
Way too many demons in my system had to flush em out
If I see you talking' down on gang you better shut you mouth
Everybody wanna know what this about
I ain't got no answers I don't got no time to listen now
[Refrain]
I got bag in my pocket
Got a bag on the way
Got a bag in every money yeah bitch I'm getting paid
I got bag in my pocket
Got a bag on the way
Got a bag in every money yeah bitch I'm getting paid
Yeah

[Interlude]
This is a certified Smrtdeath classic
Let's go emos

[Chorus]
Angels on my wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist
In the closet watch me dip dip dip dip dip dip dip
I hit the gram now watch me [?]
Angels on my wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist
In the closet watch me dip dip dip dip dip dip dip
I hit the gram now watch me [?]

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up dead
Like I don't even know where I am
Said I am an angel
Why it so painful just to get what I need in my hand
In the dam livin' like sand
Watch me slip away throw my body off the carousel
Now watch with ricochet bitch
You might also like[Refrain]
I got bag in my pocket
Got a bag on the way
Got a bag in every money yeah bitch I'm getting paid
I got bag in my pocket
Got a bag on the way
Got a bag in every money yeah bitch I'm getting paidEmbed
