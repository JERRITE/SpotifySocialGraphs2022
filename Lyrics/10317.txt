Keep You Close Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh you have no mercy
You’ve lost your sense of selflessness
I am uncertain
Of where we are and who will know

[Chorus]
There’s too many
Too many ways
To keep you close
But I can’t find one
[Verse 2]
Controversy
Is everything they can talk about
I don’t, I don’t even pay attention
I listen, I listen to all of the clues
So I'll get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh you have no mercy
You’ve lost your sense
Of selflessness

[Chorus]
There’s too many
Too many ways
To keep you close
But I can’t find the timeYou might also likeEmbed
