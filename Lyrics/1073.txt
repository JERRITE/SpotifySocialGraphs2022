Be Your Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't kiss you like he did
Bet you wish I had his lips
But I don't, no, I don't
And I can't hold you quite the same
Guess my arms don't seem as safe
When it's cold, when it's cold

[Chorus]
You got me feelin' like I don't deserve you
And I'm tryin' to deal with this pain
But it kills me 'cause I know you still love him
So now you gotta let go of someone
'Cause while you're holding on to what you had
You're not giving me a chance
To ever really be your man
[Verse 2]
You say you're fine, you're moving on
Say that I'm the only one
But I know, yes, I know
That I'm in his shadow all the time
'Cause he still creeps up on your mind
Like a ghost, like a ghost

[Chorus]
You got me feelin' like I don't deserve you
And I'm tryin' to deal with this pain
But it kills me 'cause I know you still love him
So now you gotta let go of someone
'Cause while you're holding on to what you had
You're not giving me a chance
To ever really be your man

[Bridge]
But if you let me, I could set your world on fire
Give you somethin' better than you've ever had
And if you let me in, girl we'd have everythin'
But it's like your heart is stuck in the past

[Chorus]
And it kills me 'cause I know you still love him
So now you gotta let go of someone
'Cause while you're holding on to what you had
You're not giving me a chance
To ever really be your man
You might also likeIt kills me 'cause I know you still love him
So now you gotta let go of someone
'Cause while you're holding on to what you had
You're not giving me a chance
While you're holding on to what you had
You're not giving me a chance
To ever really be your man
I'll never really be
I'll never really be
I'll never really be your man1Embed
