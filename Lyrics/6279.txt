Woman Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I fell apart
Broke from my swollen heart
Born in a simple time
Raised with a simple mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You, you may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
[Chorus]
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman) (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman, woman)

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You, you may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman

[Verse 2]
Last night I fell apart
Choked on my drunken heart

[Chorus]
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman) (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman, woman)

Who's that (woman woman)?
There's that (woman woman)
Be my (woman woman)
Won't you see me in the dark?
Who's that (woman woman)?
There's that (woman woman)
Be my (woman woman)
Won't you see me in the dark?

[Chorus]
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman) (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman woman, woman woman)

You may be a natural woman
You, you may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman9Embed
