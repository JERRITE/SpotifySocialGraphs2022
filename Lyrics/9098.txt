Resurrected LyricsAddicted to everything, oil, money, alcohol, drugs, status, power, sex, and privilege

Everyday I stretch my neck
Falling into black water
Try and dodge the swatter
I don’t want to bother
Unplug and cut the chord
I always think about my father
I’m about to leave the building
Constant mental power drilling
I let go and it starts spilling
I’ve been somewhere else before this
Now beset with disconnections
Someday I’ll be resurrected
Into someone unaffected

Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty? Here's something you can buy
To escape from my problems and my life

Pain everyday
I’d take the train along my blue vein
Or take a trip to my brains drained state
Misunderstood
I thought everything would speak for itself
Out of power to unravel to the masses
I thought everything would speak for itself

Just to get you through the day
And back into your bed again
So many people got a big head
For a life that guarantees death
Can’t infect another insect
Squished on the asphalt
It’s not earth that I’m living on
Some kinda man made spawn
Human so I’ve got the sickness
These worthless, my addiction's witness
You might also likeI’ve been somewhere else before this
Now beset with disconnections
Someday I’ll be resurrected
Into someone unaffectedEmbed
