Four Letters Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been down this road before
The minute that we get closer, I get colder
Got an angel in my sight
But it's these demons deep inside, they can't hold you

[Pre-Chorus]
And all my friends keep on wondering why I haven't tried
(I ask myself that question over again)
It's like your love keeps on counting down
Am I running out?
Wish my heart could talk but it's all in my head
[Chorus]
If I had five more words I'd say "I wish you were mine"
But it's these four letters that hold me back every time
It might take three more drinks I'll tеll you what's on my mind
But if I'm too late my heart breaks for this onе thing
You and I

[Verse 2]
I know you'd take my stubborn heart
And you would heal all of these scars
If I let you in
If I keep on holding back
You'd be the best I never had and that haunts me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all yours friends keep on wondering why I haven't tried
(I ask myself that question over again)
I know your love keeps on counting down
Am I running out?
Wish my heart could talk but it's all in my head

[Chorus]
If I had five more words I'd say "I wish you were mine"
But it's these four letters that hold me back every time
It might take three more drinks I'll tell you what's on my mind
But if I'm too late my heart breaks for this one thing
You and I
You might also like[Bridge]
Your eyes, your look
Your skin, your love
It gets too much
(And I don't know if I'll be good enough)
Your eyes, your look
Your skin, your love
It gets too much
And I don't know if I'll be good enough

[Chorus]
Five more words I'd say "I wish you were mine"
But it's these four letters that hold me back every time (Hold me back)
It might take three more drinks I'll tell you what's on my mind
But if I'm too late my heart breaks for this one thing
You and I

[Outro]
You and I
Oh-oh yeah
You and IEmbed
