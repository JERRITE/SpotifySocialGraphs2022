Inspector Mills Lyrics[Intro]
*phone ringing*
Hello?

[Verse 1]
Inspector Mills, I'd like to tell you 'bout a girl I saw
At a party just the other night in Beverly Hills
Inspector Mills, I hope you find her, and it don't take long
Watch my feelings for her growing strong
In a war of wills, Inspector Mills
[Chorus 1]
I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I didn't see her walking out of the door
If I had taken my time, she'd be standing here still
Inspector Mills

[Verse 2]
I recall once in my life I've felt this way before
But I let her go and closed the door and walk away
Inspector Mills, I can't attempt to show the hurt in me
And just how much I need the company
Search the valleys and the hills, you gotta find her, Mr. Mills

[Chorus 2]
I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I was blinded by the look in her eyes
If I had taken my time, she'd be sitting here still
Inspector Mills

[Bridge]
Ooh, someday soon
I might be in love with you

[Verse 5]
Inspector Mills, I guess you've taken quite a look around
Guess I felt the need among the crowd, she's gone for good
Inspector Mills, is it any crime for a fool like me?
Try to use your time 'cause I wanna see
You just send me the bill, Inspector Mills, Inspector Mills
You might also like[Chorus 3]
I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I didn't see her walking out of the door
If I had taken my time she'd be lying here still
Inspector Mills, Inspector

[Chorus 4]
I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I was blinded by the look in her eyes
If I had have just followed through
Then I wouldn't be calling you1Embed
