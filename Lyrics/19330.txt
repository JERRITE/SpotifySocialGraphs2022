Letter to My Ex Lyrics[Chorus: Ar'mon And Trey]
We could have a house, a house on the lake
But you couldn't wait
But who could you blame?
Cuz you don't love yourself
(I made my mistakes)
You still didn't stay
The time for yourself
You had me replaced
But who can I blame?
Rained on my own parade
I know you was down for me baby
Cause I took advantage of you baby
Talking to Vicky and fucking on Nicki
But you was allowing it baby
Sleeping on you I was lazy
Did that shit on the daily
Now you done dipped, the table done flipped
And I'm tryna handle it baby
[Verse 1: Chris Sails]
All your family looked down on me
Look at me now
Forget getting rich when I'm old nigga I want it now
You had everybody thinking we goals
When the camera off its shit that they don't know
I was unhappy girl
I just didn't let it show
Said you want to hurt me girl, I know
Talking to a new nigga, how you cope
Must have been talking to him on the low
Cuz you moved on too fast
It's my fault that we ain't last
Should I called her phone, fuck that
Cuz now I'm about my bag
Want me to chase you that shit dead
Your friends all in your head
Tryna tell you that I ain't shit
But we both know what it is

[Chorus: Ar'mon And Trey]
We could have a house, a house on the lake
But you couldn't wait
But who could you blame?
Cuz you don't love yourself
(I made my mistakes)
You still didn't stay
The time for yourself
You had me replaced
But who can I blame?
Rained on my own parade
I know you was down for me baby
Cause I took advantage of you baby
Talking to Vicky and fucking on Nicki
But you was allowing it baby
Sleeping on you I was lazy
Did that shit on the daily
Now you done dipped, the table done flipped
And I'm tryna handle it baby

Fuck it, I admit it that I wanted love
You would turn me off with all that shit you done
Two sides of a story but they only heard one
They only heard one
Girl know your own worth
How you gone love me and you ain't love you first
Our relationship was fake
That shit was bad for my health
Here you go blaming me for all that shit that I did
Said I wanted something new and shit
That's what I did
You was my rib, nahh you was my Eve
Yeah I did stupid shit that you won't believe
But who was there when you ain't have nothing to eat
Who was there to put your ass back on your feet
Now you talking to a new nigga, it ain't me
Nah nah it ain't me
Nah nah it ain't me

[Chorus: Ar'mon And Trey]
With your new bae
We could have a house
A house on the lake
But you couldn't wait
(But who could you blame?)
But who could you blame?
(But you don't love yourself)
You don't love yourself
I made my mistakes
You didn't stay
The time for yourself
You had me replaced
But who could I blame
Rained on my own parade
I know you was down for me baby
Cause I took advantage of you baby
Talking to Vicky and fucking on Nicki
But you was allowing it baby
Sleeping on you I was lazy
Did that shit on the daily
Now you done dipped, the table done flipped
And I'm tryna handle it baby13Embed
