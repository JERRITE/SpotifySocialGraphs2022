Do My Own Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I spent my whole life trying to fit into a lane
But I'm so over it
I watched my friends fall out of love and go insane
Bid on life and lose the game
I saw them quit

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanna be like that
A suit and tie copycat
I never was into that
[Chorus]
Hey-yo, nanana
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing
Hey-yo, na-na-na
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing

[Verse 2]
I spent so long with my head buried in the sand
My future needs a rewrite
So I'll send a postcard from wherever I may land
I ain't got no master plan and that's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanna be like that
A suit and tie copycat
I never was into that

[Chorus]
Hey-yo, na-na-na
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing
Hey-yo, na-na-na
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing

I'ma do my own thing
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing

[Bridge]
Time won't get the best of me
I see the world so different
You do you, you do you and I'll do me
March into my own parade
My heart don't beat any other way
You do you, you do you and I'll do me, me, me, me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing

[Chorus]
Hey-yo, na-na-na
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing
Hey-yo, na-na-na
I said hey-yo, I'm all good
I'ma do my own thing
(I'ma, I'ma) I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do me
I'ma do my own thing3Embed
