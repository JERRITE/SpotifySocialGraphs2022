Off She Goes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where, where do you go
When the light leaves your eyes
And you're just out of reach
Like a tree-bound kite?

What's on your mind
As you're staring behind?
And I'm on my own in your arms tonight

Ooh
Na, na, na, na, off she goes
[Verse 2]
Where, where do you go
When the tears leave your eyes?
When you feel that burn
I know words can't describe
Where do you go?
Remember when you told me?
Remember when you told me?

[Chorus]
When you can't believe in yourself
All you hear is anyone else
And if you'd just believe in yourself
We can tune out everyone else

That's all right
Oh, that's all right
All right

[Post-Chorus]
Feel the earth underneath
Snatch a star, you can reach
Feel the earth leave your feet
We can glide, don't need streets
You might also like[Chorus]
When you can't believe in yourself
All you hear is anyone else
And if you'd just believe in yourself
We can tune out everyone else

That's alright
Ooh
Na, na, na, na, off she goes

Oh, that's alright
Ooh
Na, na, na, na, off she goes

[Post-Chorus]
Feel the earth underneath
Snatch a star you can reach
Feel the earth leave your feet
We can glide, don't need streets, yeah

Ooh
Na na na na, off she goes

[Chorus]
When you can't believe in yourself
All you hear is anyone else
And if you'd just believe in yourself
We can tune out everyone else, yeah
When you can't believe in yourself
All you hear is anyone else
And if you'd just believe in yourself
We can tune out everyone else

That's alright
Ooh
Na, na, na, na, off she goes
That's all right, oh

[Outro]
Where, where do you go
When the light leaves your eyes?
When you're just out of reach
Like a tree-bound kite

What's on your mind
As you're staring behind?
And I'm on my own in your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm on my own in your arms tonight1Embed
