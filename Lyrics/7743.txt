I Look Anyway Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was walking down the wrong road
Blinded by the street lights
Drinking with the wrong girls
Acting like a monster
Staying out all night

I was fighting all the wrong wars
Reading all the wrong signs
Driving past your front door
I know it's the long way
I'm hoping I'll see your light
Now all I want is you
But the one thing I can't have is you

[Chorus]
Now you've left for someone new
I missed the boat and I lost you
There is nothing I can do
There are no words to explain
I search a picture of your face
And although it causes so much pain
I look anyway
I look anyway
I just can't look away
Though it causes so much pain
I look anyway

[Verse 2]
You're pulling on my heartstrings
You kill me on the inside
Even though it's my choice
I just want the wrong girl
How can I look away?

Now all I want is you
But the one thing I can't have is you
You might also like[Chorus]
Now you've left for someone new
I missed the boat and I lost you
And there is nothing I can do
There are no words to explain
I search a picture of your face
And although it causes so much pain
I look anyway
I look anyway
I just can't look away, yeah
And though it causes so much pain
I look anyway

[Bridge]
I want you so bad but I can't go back
Can't go back to the things we had
I want you so bad but I can't go back
Can't go back to the things we had

[Chorus]
Now you've left for someone new
I've missed the boat and I lost you
And there is nothing I can do, oh oh oh
There are no words to explain
I search a picture of your face
And though it causes so much pain
I look anyway
I look anyway
I just can't look away
I say I'll never look again
And though it causes so much pain
I look anyway
[Outro]
I want you so bad but I can't go back
I can't go back to the things we had
I want you so bad but I can't go back
I can't go back to the things we hadEmbed
