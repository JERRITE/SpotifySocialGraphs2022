I’m a Sucker for a Liar in a Red Dress Lyrics[Verse 1]
She used to be a good girl
Now she's a fucking nightmare
I always see her face
Everywhere I go
Might be a little crazy
But I ain't what she made me
Everything she does
Yeah, it kills me slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think I'll make it out alive
See the devil living in those eyes
She's the only thing that gets me high
So high, so high
And her words are
Spiderwebs inside my head
And I know that
She might kill me slow, but

[Chorus]
I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her eyes come alive in the sunset
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her lips have sex with a cigarette
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm in love with the madness)
(I'm in love with the madness)

[Verse 2]
I used to be a bad boy
Now I'm just a sad boy
Crawling on the ground
For a taste of her
My heart is in her hands
And I feel like half a man
She cuts me down to size
But I like the hurt
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think I'll make it out alive
See the devil living in those eyes
She's the only thing that gets me high
So high

[Chorus]
I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her eyes come alive in the sunset
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her lips have sex with a cigarette
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm in love with the madness)
(I'm in love with the madness)

[Bridge]
And her words are
Spiderwebs inside my head
And I know that
She might kill me slow, but
[Chorus]
I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her eyes come alive in the sunset
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

I'm a sucker for a liar in a red dress
Her lips have sex with a cigarette
She knows I can't help myself
I'm in love with the madness

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm in love with the madness)
(I'm in love with the madness)2Embed
