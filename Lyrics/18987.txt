The American Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you fly in from Birmingham
You'll get the last gate
If you blew in from Boston
No, you sure won't have to wait

[Chorus]
And I'm learnin' a little more every day
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way
[Verse 2]
I've noticed I don't get much help
When they see my blue jeans
Some slick with a suit walks up
"Oh, can I help you, please?"

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm learnin' as I gain a little age
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way

[Verse 3]
Some high society lady says
"Is your horse outside?"
"No, ma'am he's between my legs
But you're too fat to ride!"

[Chorus]
And you're learnin' a little more about my ways
And what I think about your dollar
And your white collar
And your good old American way

[Verse 4]
If you don't like my Nudie boots
I'm sorry about that
Don't make fun of my hat too
Or you might get knocked flat
You might also like[Chorus]
And you'll learn some more if you ever pass down our way
Aww, 'bout the folks without the dollars
And without white collars
Hell, they are the American wayEmbed
