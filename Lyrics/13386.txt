BABYDOLL (Speed) Lyrics[Intro]
Call me Babydoll

[Verse 1]
Darling, I'm fallin'
Fucked up over you
Bite me, bruise me
Leave me like you do
Darling, I'm callin'
Lay me in my tomb
(In my tomb)
[Chorus]
Call me Babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home

[Verse 2]
Oh father, forgive me
For all my sins
When I meet your eyes
The devil, he wins
Blinded by your lies
But I play pretend
(Play pretend)

[Chorus]
Call me Babydoll
Come break down thеse walls
Don't leave mе alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a home

[Bridge]
Wrapped around your finger
Wish your tongue would linger
I need your warmth
Just to stay high
Now, you're holding me down
I scream but make no sound
Nothing to hold
My hands are tied
You might also like[Chorus]
Call me Babydoll
Come break down these walls
Don't leave me alone
Call me Babydoll
Too cold, it's withdrawal
This house ain't a homeEmbed
