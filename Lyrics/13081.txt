On Fye Lyrics[Verse 1: Zzzahara]
I’m on fire for the first time
I’m on fire, it’s been a long time
And my new girl, she brings out my shine
And I’m sipping on this red wine
For the first time, it all seems alright
I ain’t hurting, I’m not in pain
It feels uncommon, but I will take it
I will take it and make it mine

[Verse 2: Eyedress]
It’s been awhile
Since I've seen you cry
For the first time
I feel alright
Don’t let me go
I’m not going through this again
I love you so
Just tell me what you want
If there’s a problem
Then I’ll take it
And I’ll take it
And make it right
If this is what it takes to be with you
I’ll do anything for you
Anything for you
You came to me as a surprise
She met me at the right timе
She’s so good for my mind
Good for my mind
Good for my mindYou might also like3Embed
