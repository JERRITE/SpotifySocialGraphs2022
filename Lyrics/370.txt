Let the blessings flow
Let the blessings flow, oh
Right to my soul
My thirsty soul
Let the blessings flow

[Verse: Vory & DJ Khaled]
Said I'm grateful for not anything but everything
Every loss I had to take, I took it on the chin
We still on the hot ten
And I knew one day that we would win again
Been preyed on my downfall by many men
Oh, Lord, I thank you for not giving in
Must I tell ’em once again?
All I do is win
You either win with us or watch us win
That's why I'm grateful, oh, for anything and everything
That’s why I'm grateful, oh, for anything and everything
Oh, Lord, I'm grateful, oh, for anything and everything
Oh, oh
That's why I'm grateful, oh, Lord
So that's why I'm grateful, oh, Lord
Behind every loss, it came with many rings
Even though the hatred came with many things
'Cause I can’t go for anything
Even though my plate full, I can’t complain, I'm grateful
Even though my plate full, I can’t complain, it's everything that I prayed for
Oh, Lord, I'm grateful
Oh, Lord, I'm grateful
Oh, Lord, I’m grateful
[Chorus: Nancy Grandquist]
Let the blessings flow
Let the blessings flow, oh
Right to my soul
My thirsty soulYou might also likeEmbed
