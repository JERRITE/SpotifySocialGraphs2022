TranslationsPortuguêsComa Lyrics[Intro: Playa Fly & YUNG MUTT]
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
(Ayy, Yuuung Mutt!)
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
(Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah)
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
[Verse 1: YUNG MUTT]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the fuck was that ugly ass boy I saw?
Yung Mutt, what a dumbfuck, dirty like a dump truck
Such a fucking bum, hauntin' sluts guts
I'm disgusted, I'm busted up
What the fuck did I just put up my nose?
I'm buggin' out, knees buckle
I'm duckin' out, I'm in trouble
Now I can see the clouds, lights out
Now I lay myself to sleep, now that I can rest in peace
No questioning my misery, my deathwish granted blissful sleep
My body turns to worms for the birds to eat
Internal decay for eternity

[Hook: Playa Fly]
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard

[Verse 2: $CRIM]
I can't lie, lately, I been on the fucking edge
Pistol gripped up on my lap
Xanax, heroin, bunch of meds
Fantasizin' about death, just need one in my temple
Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead and now I'm dead
Descendin' through hell, nothing but burnin' flesh smells
I scream, and scream, and scream
And hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me, that was my old life
Antichrist, he has empowered me

Mmm, mmm, good—
Mmm, mmm, good—
