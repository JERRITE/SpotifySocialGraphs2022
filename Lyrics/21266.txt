Never Too Late (To Get Some Pussy Tonight) Lyrics[Verse 1]
1 AM on a Saturday night
Looking for some gash, preferably tight
Open up the Tinder, I got no matches
But there's plenty of fish in the sea with plenty of snatches

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a tasty little beaver I'm gonna get on
Gonna be fucking before the dawn

[Chorus]
Cause it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
No, it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
It's never too late to get some pussy tonight
[Verse 2]
Sunday morning is coming in hot
Met a girl with a missing leg and I bought hеr a shot
She asked me to talk to hеr stump and I wasn't shy
But she ended up leaving the bar with another guy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Gonna find a girl with both her legs
Steel Panther's gonna fertilize her eggs

[Chorus]
Cause it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
No, it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late to get some pussy tonight

[Bridge]
Don't give up you still have time
To find some ugly hookers and some cocaine lines

[Verse 3]
Flying on x, sun's about to rise
Thinking bout getting a handy from one of the guys
Or heating up some apple pie, maybe that's my date
Then I remembered some words of wisdom from Stix', it's never too late

Now Spyder's on the bass cause, Lexxi's is gone
But it doesn't mean we can't still fuck his mom

[Chorus]
Cause it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
No, it's never too late to get some pussy tonight
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late
It's never too late to get some pussy tonight

[Outro]
Gotta get it tonight
Gotta get some pussy tonight
Gotta get some pussy tonight
Gotta get some pussy tonightEmbed
