Woah

Woah
Woah
Woah
[BARNUM]
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for

[CROWD]
Woah

[BARNUM]
Been searchin' in the dark, your sweat soakin' through the floor

[CROWD]
Woah

[BARNUM]
And buried in your bones there's an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealin' your mind
And all that was real is left behind

Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feelin' takin' over

[ODDITIES]
Oh

[BARNUM]
It's fire, it's freedom, it's floodin' open
You might also like[ODDITIES]
Oh

[BARNUM]
It's a preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion

[ODDITIES]
Oh

[BARNUM]
There's somethin' breakin' at the brick of every wall that's holdin'

[ODDITIES]
Oh

[BARNUM]
All that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

[BARNUM & ODDITIES]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you

[ODDITIES & CROWD]
Oh! This is the greatest show!
[BARNUM]
We light it up, we won't come down

[BARNUM & ODDITIES]
And the sun can't stop us now

[BARNUM]
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you

[ODDITIES & CROWD]
Oh! This is the greatest show!

[ODDITIES]
Woah

[BARNUM]
Colossal we come these renegades in the ring

[ODDITIES]
Woah

[BARNUM]
Where the lost get found and we crown 'em the circus kings

[BARNUM & ODDITIES]
Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blindin', outshinin' anything that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're callin' and you wanna go

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night

[ODDITIES]
Impossible comes true

[BARNUM]
Intoxicatin' you

[ODDITIES & CROWD]
Oh! This is the greatest show!
