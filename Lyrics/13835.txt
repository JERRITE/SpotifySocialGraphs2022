Far Out Lyrics[Intro]
You ready, Q?
Let's do it
Give 'em like two bars, how many you want? Two bars?
Yeah, two bars is cool
Cool, let's go

[Verse 1]
It doesn't seem like it could be
Anybody else but truly me
And I'm only better when I dream, yeah
I wish I had more secrets
How could it be?
Oh, how could it be?
And how could it be?
And how could it be, be, be, be?
[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to listen
How could it be different now? Wouldn't know the difference
Even if I'm trying, I feel like I'm not living
Even if you hold me down, are you fucking with me?
'Cause I'm going far out
And I'm going far out, oh, and I
And I'm going far out
And I'm going

[Verse 3]
I hope that this makes its way
I hope that I don't ride in vain
Oh, I try to vindicate so it weighs lesser
So if it turns up again, I don't feel this way, oh, no
And I try not to say what I'm really meaning
'Cause I don't want the chaos if I hurt your feelings
Oh, please don't say I'm cold, yeah
I got good intentions, babe, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm far out
Far out, oh, and I, and I
I'm so far out

[Verse 4]
I hope that this makes it way
I hope I never ride in vain
So if it turns up again
I will never ever feel this way again
Oh, no
