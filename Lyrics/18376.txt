Wifey Lyrics[Intro]
Ahh, turn the clicker off for me... there ya go
Uh-huh
Da-da-da-da

[Hook]
Aye, speak to me kindly
I'm the type of girl you call "Wifey"
Yeah (yeah)
I ain't no side piece
I'm the one you takin' home to Momsies
C'mon (c'mon)
Ah, speak to me kindly (speak to me kindly)
I'm the type of girl you call "Wifey"
Yeah (yeah)
I'm such a dime piece (I'm such a dime piece)
Bag me, and I'll never leave yo' side, B
[Verse 1]
You know I'm gifted when it comes to havin' loyalty
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But don't get it twisted, I don't take no shit from nobody
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know it's so hard to commit with all these chicks around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You act so different with yo' boys, and throw yo' dick around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Too late to return the ring
And if you can't hang now, you can rock a fling
How come everyday I slay from the crack of dawn
But you act so dumb, like your brain is off?
So, don't yawn. Bitch wrong
This broad is on
You better get strong
If "nah", move along now...
Somebody better gonna right your wrong
I could sing it for ya all day long

[Verse 2]
It seems like everybody's lookin' for eternal bliss
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what you find when you unbutton my Versace dress
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't be a pussy and come at me with commitment shit
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd die for you, act like you know what time it is
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

These hips are a work of art
And if you don't see that, death do us part
Now, I ain't even gonna flex, 'cause I am the best
No Becky in distress, I'm a dragon in a dress
I don't get no rest (aye), everyday I'm blessed (uh)
Workin' my finesse (uh), Tiffany on my neck (yea)
It's a boo thing, not a new thing
You betta' get it right if you talkin' to me
Must'a had a mind, smart enough to choose me
Your boys say it's fine, you're supposed to use me
You don't wanna fuck around hard enough to lose me
So, whenever I'm around, would you please salute me?
(Please salute me, please salute me)

[Outro]
I could be yo' wife all yo' life
I could be yo' Wifey
(Aye, aye, aye)
Betta' roll a strike and hold on to me tightly
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
Or I'll break your heart, he will not take it lightly
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
No, the revenge of the Wifey
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

I need a man who's gonna propose to me on a mountain
That's gonna bring me flowers every Wednesday, and who's gonna call me when he's outta' town...6Embed
