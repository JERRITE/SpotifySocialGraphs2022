Are World LyricsAnd it starts

[Verse 1: Misterelle]
When all I had was fifty-cents they laughed, all of them, in my face
So I'm 50 Cent, I'll laugh all the way to the bank
I remember being 15, racking my brain
Waiting to blow like a 15 second grenade
Cousins had AR-15's, weaponry bayed
Point-blank, talking M-16's pressed at your braid
17 with inf beams where we were raised
To all my niggas who'd shift keys, capital raised
Capital AK's, half of them ain't aim
Screaming fuck the police, if they catch us give fake names
Teller, you sat on your ass while I made change
So sit down on your five-dollar ass 'fore I make change
Girl played hard-to-get, knew I'd have her by 8th grade
Though every since my arrival, no more asking if they came
Hand on the bible, they weren't "ratchet" as they'd claim
Hand on a rifle, scare your pastor then say praise
Stabbed in the spinal then it's back to the chain gang
Pop! quiz? test them, bet they pass it with straight A's
And the places where they live, will remind you of "They Live"
The day lives on but tomorrow, I'd say's slain
[Hook: Misterelle]
In a world where they label you a fuck-up in
When the worlds just a big place to fuck up in
And with that said, lets get fucked up then
And with that said, lets get fucked up then
Are you paying for this bitch? then shut the fuck up then
And find a Holiday Inn where we can fuck up in
Are World
Are World
Are World
Bup Bup Bup Bup Bup Bup
Are World
Bup Bup Bup Bup Bup Bup

[Verse 2: Misterelle]
Stop your blood clot crying
And I'll stop chopping onions in my HSN appliance
I'm Vega when I'm slicing and you're playing with M. Bison
On MK Deadly Alliance
Give them the loud shh, bet it make them niggas quiet
As a baby pacifying
Or witnessing and killing and I'm paying for your silence
Disciplining children, or librarians when filing
Shishing them to listen, meditation to a psychic
Or a display of pantomiming
Ain't saying that it's minding
But take it to the tomb, donating them to science
So I'm taking them to school
Laying in my drool, I'm laying never lying
You take up the assignments, I'll just take up for the righteous
Colour me whatever, just don't paint me a maroon
Or label me the Fool like People Under the Stairs
As I ollie down your stairs, don't hate on how I'm grinding
Firestations and the hydrens, the pavement and the pool
Trappers throw pebbles, this is David and Goliath
But I rather not peddle, I'm think "grind, Relle"
I'm skating while you're biking, rebels say that I'm a riot
Aviators and the pilots are saying I'm the fliest
Dictators and the tyrants are saying that I rule
And mimic statues, 'til they make one in my likeness
In my Spike Lee Joint, 40 acres and mule
