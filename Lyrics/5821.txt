Shake Up Christmas Lyrics[Intro]
Ho, ho, ho
Shake up the happiness, wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time

[Verse 1]
There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, Ho, Ho
Ho, Ho, Ho
It's Christmas time

[Verse 2]
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:
"I got dreams, and I got love
I got my feet on the ground, and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me"

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

[Bridge]
I know you're out there, I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where your boots have been
I'm gonna show them, so they will know then
Their love will grow and they believe again

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time (Ho, ho, ho)
Shake it up, shake up the happiness (Ho, ho, ho)
Wake it up, wake up the happiness (Ho, ho, ho)
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time (Ho, ho, ho)
Shake it up, shake up the happiness (Ho, ho, ho)
Wake it up, wake up the happiness (Ho, ho, ho)
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
[Outro]
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time1Embed
