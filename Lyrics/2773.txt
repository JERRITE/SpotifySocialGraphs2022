Down This Road Lyrics(I'ma bust 'til I fall to the dust
My engine will keep-)

[Verse 1: Fatt Tarr]
I think about my life and my mind and my time about the same
If I don’t give ’em all I got then with the rain they’ll change
I know I been paintin’ pictures that's richer than all this wicker
After all of that I learned blood is thicker than beer and liquor
If you don’t slow down life’ll catch ya like a pitcher
Ninety-five mile per hour fast ball you better hit’er
Never quitter, I’m a winner get my frickin’ chicken dinner
I’m gon’ kick it ‘til the end
Until my bones n’ shins are splinters
I’m a victor, not a victim, tell that son of a bitch to come get him some
Homegrown by nature, I don’t give a damn about what you’ve done
Rollin’ stone, this ranger been run off the road and in plenty mud
I'ma come back with the dual smoke stacks
12 pack in the back and that's just because
I'ma bust ‘til I fall to the dust
My engine gon’ keep a'runnin' 'til it's stuck and full of rust
My family and C-Hubb the only ones that I trust
Don't like it, it's not a must, we’re doin' this shit for us
[Chorus: C-Hubb]
'Cause there ain't no way to know if I’m gonna make it
It’s a once in a lifetime chance, and I’m gonna take it
I’ve been travelin’ down this road for so long
Just a'searchin' for my soul and the strength to go on
But I'ma keep on keepin’ on
I'ma keep on keepin’ on

[Verse 2: C-Hubb]
First of all, if you’re listening
Then I wanna say Thank You, greatly
‘Cause my mind has been goin’ each and every direction lately
It’s amazing how crazy this shit gets, so I been hazy
Workin’ my hardest tryin’ to be the South’s Slim Shady
'Cause I been focusin' on music in my free time
Me n' Tarr plan to make a livin' off of these rhymes
But I'm workin' my ass off at a factory and I'm mad at me
'Cause I know that I’ve got talent when it comes to music that someone has to see
So gradually I’m practicing and mastering the skills I use
Next time when I get up in the booth
I got the best rhymes and I still tell the truth
And the truth is
If I don’t make it doin’ music I don’t know what the hell to do
This is my life, that’s why I write the things I’m tellin' you
I speak my heart and soul and all our fans got a heart of gold
Y'all are the reason that we're here no matter what y'all are told
So, I’m simply gonna end this with a “Thank You.”
And I’ll be reppin' Tiller Gang 'til I can’t move

(No, there ain't no way to know)
If I’m gonna make it but I only got one shot so boe I gotta take it
(No, there ain't no way to know)
It’s a damn long road but I got a strong soul
I'ma let the story unfold
And I'm gonna keep on keepin' on
The pages turnin' until their gone
If I make it, I’ll take it, n' if I do
Then I’m thanking everyone involved
I’m thanking everyone involved
It takes everyone of y'all
Damn it, I believe in my team and my dreams
It’s all I need to succeed, so I'm keepin' on!

[Chorus: C-Hubb]
'Cause there ain't no way to know if I'm gonna make it
It's a once in a lifetime chance, and I'm gonna take it
I’ve been travelin’ down this road for so long
Just a'searchin’ for my soul and the strength to go on
But I'ma keep on keepin’ on
I'ma keep on keepin’ on4Embed
