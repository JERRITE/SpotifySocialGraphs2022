Vesperâ€™s Goodbye LyricsAll of you
Shaped me into what I am
Carried out the bigger man
Do you have a master plan? Oh, no

Somewhere I
Let all my defenses down
Never thought to turn around
And you did not make a sound

See it turning red
Like a bullet through the chest
Lay me down to rest
It's a lover's final breath
And I found out
Nothing comes without a cost
And life was just a game we lost
Do you have a better thought? Oh

Now you're gone
And nothing's ever felt so wrong
A moment seems to last so long
Do you have a fear so strong?

See it turning red
Like a bullet through the chest
Lay me down to rest
It's a lover's final breath

Now I die
And kiss your tender lips goodbye
Pray to God who hears my cryYou might also like1Embed
