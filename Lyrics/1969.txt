Take a Hint Lyrics[Intro: Victoria Justice]
(La la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la-la-la-la)
(La la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la-la-la-la)

[Verse 1: Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gillies & Both]
Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like?
I can always see 'em coming, from the left or from the right
I don't want to be a priss, I'm just tryna be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the—
Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot
You think that we should hook up, but I think that we should not
You had me at "Hello", then you opened up your mouth
And that is when it started going south, oh!
[Chorus: Victoria Justice & Elizabeth Gillies]
Get your hands off my hips, or I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my— (Hey!)
Take a hint, take a hint
No,​ you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint

[Verse 2: Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gillies & Both]
I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top
You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was "Stop"
And if I had a dime for every name that you just dropped
You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht, oh!

[Chorus: Victoria Justice & Elizabeth Gillies]
Get your hands off my hips, or I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my— (Hey!)
Take a hint, take a hint
No,​ you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint

[Bridge: Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gillies & Both]
What about "No" don't you get?
So go and tell your friends
I'm not really interested
It's about time that you're leavin'
I'm gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and you'll be gone

(Two) Or I'll punch you in the—
(Three) Stop your staring at my— (Hey!)
Take a hint, take a hint
I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
Take a hint, take a hint, whoa
Get your hands off my hips, or I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my— (Hey!)
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint23Embed
