The First Cut Is the Deepest Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's takin' almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
[Verse 2]
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
'Cause I'm sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, I'll try to love again
But baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest

[Outro]
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I knowYou might also like3Embed
