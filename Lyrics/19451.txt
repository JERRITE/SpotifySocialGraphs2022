2 birds Lyrics[Intro]
I know you ain't forget my number
I know you ain't fucking with my brother
Well I guess now he's not my brother
Well I guess now I cannot love you
And then you moved away in the summer

[Verse 1]
I say, one-two, meet me outside
Three-four, girls in my ride
I'm not sure if I got room for you, for you (Okay)
Do you fuck with me still?
Not sure that I give a fuck
But I do know I can't give one tonight, tonight (For real)
I'm back on my bullshit
New phone, who's this?
I'm back doing what I wanna do now
I'm back running 'round with the crew now
[Chorus]
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
I poured you that shit you like
You love that, you love that
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
We don't need to complicate it (We don't)
We love that, we love that

[Verse 2]
We love that, we loving that, uh
That strong gas, we puffing that, uh
I draw you a little bubble bath
Ooh you like it like that, yeah I love to make it splash, yeah
She all that, she all that (She all that)
She call but I can't call back (I won't)
Yeah, got a couple bad bitches, might share it tonight
Share it tonight (Hey)

[Chorus]
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
I poured you that shit you like
We love that, we love that
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
We don't need to complicate it
We love that, we love that
You might also like[Bridge]
Ooh, she from Kansas
I can't stand it, God damn it (Can't stand this shit)
A different planet
That ass right there, another planet
God damn it (God damn it), can't stand it (Woo)
But I can't sit 'cause I be standing tall
I be going hard, I be doing it all (Yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Chorus]
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
I poured you that shit you like
We love that, we love that
I ain't saying that I miss you babe
I'm just saying I'm glad you made it
We don't need to complicate it
We love that (Ayy)

[Post-Chorus]
I told you that I'd be fine
I told you I just need time
Got her face outta my head
And the whole thing off of my chest
Said one two meet me outside
Three, four girls in my ride
Got a couple bad bitches, might share it tonight
Share it tonight (Hey)
[Outro]
I know you ain't forget my number
I know you ain't fucking with my brother
Well I guess now he's not my brother
I guess now I cannot love you
And then you moved away in the summer2Embed
