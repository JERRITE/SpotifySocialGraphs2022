Darling Be Home Soon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come and talk of all the things we did today
Hear and laugh about our funny little ways
While we have a few minutes to breathe
And I know that it's time you must leave

[Chorus]
But darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to
[Verse 2]
And now a quarter of my life is almost past
I think I've come to see myself at last
And I see that the time spent confused
Was the time that I spent without you
And I feel myself in bloom

[Chorus]
So darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So darling, my darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

[Verse 3]
Go and beat your crazy head against the sky
Try and see beyond the houses and your eyes
It's okay to shoot the moon
You might also like[Chorus]
Darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to1Embed
