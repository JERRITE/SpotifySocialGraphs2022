Cold Sweats! Lyrics[Intro]
Don't make me call my shooter, he tote whole Tecs
(That boy JDolla go crazy)
I know she wan' fuck by how the ho text
(Lambda, Lambda)

[Chorus]
Don't make me call my shooter, he tote whole Tecs (He tote whole Tecs)
I know she wan' fuck by how the ho text (By the ho texts)
I done ran it up and got 'em more wet (Got 'em more wet)
I ran out of drugs, now I got cold sweats (NowI got cold sweats, ah)
They asked where I'm from, put on the whole Tex' (Put on the whole Tex')
I don't wanna fuck, I want that ho neck (Want the ho neck, ahh)
You don't want no smoke, you know we carry blicks (Carry blicks)
My blood'll walk you down and he from Stop 6 (Stop 6)
[Interlude]
Huh-ahh, huh
Mm-hmm, ha

[Verse]
I don't wanna fuck, I want that ho neck (That ho neck)
Caught that nigga, tried to run, he couldn't make four steps (Couldn't make four steps)
I know she wan' be with me, all she said she want is me
Her home-girl wanted to intervene, I sent her ass straight to gang
You just popped a codeine three and I just popped a pink and blue
This bitch say she tired of me and she said, "I ain't seein' you" (Seein' you)
I just caught 'em one-by-one and now that up the score by two (Up by two)
They gon' come in on-by-one, but I'ma fuck 'em two-by-two (Two-by-two)

[Chorus]
Don't make me call my shooter, he tote whole Tecs (He tote whole Tecs)
I know she wan' fuck by how the ho text (By the ho texts)
I done ran it up and got 'em more wet (Got 'em more wet)
I ran out of drugs, now I got cold sweats (NowI got cold sweats, ah)
They asked where I'm from, put on the whole Tex' (Put on the whole Tex')
I don't wanna fuck, I want that ho neck (Want the ho neck, ahh)
You don't want no smoke, you know we carry blicks (Carry blicks)
My blood'll walk you down and he from Stop 6 (Stop 6)

[Outro]
