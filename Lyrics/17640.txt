Pump It Up (Dastic Remix) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
It’s not so long ago, that this sound hit the nation
Every Saturday night, on your favorite radio
The party’s jumping and the vibe feels so strong
Throw your hands in the air, lift your head up high
You know you've got to sing along

[Chorus]
Ah don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
[Drop]
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s not so long ago, that this sound hit the nation (You’ve got to pump it up)
Every Saturday night, on your favorite radio (Got to pump it up)
The party’s jumping and the vibe feels so strong (You’ve got to pump it up)
Throw your hands in the air, lift your head up high
You know you've got to sing along

[Chorus]
Ah don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it up

[Drop]
You’ve got to pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
Don’t you know, pump it up
You’ve got to pump it upYou might also likeEmbed
