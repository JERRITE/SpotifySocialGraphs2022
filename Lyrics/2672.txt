Love No More Lyrics[Intro]
Love no more, no more, no more, oh
Love no more, no more, no more

[Verse 1]
Say it ain't so
Why you acting like I don't know?
Things between us getting cutthroat
It ain't adding up
Think I had enough, enough
[Pre-Chorus]
I could see through you
You did everything you said you wouldn't do
You're praying I don't find somebody new
I'm trying but I can't help it, can't help it

[Chorus]
I don't want your love no more (No more, no more, no more)
It's not what I'm looking for (Oh)
I don't want your love (Oh)
If you can't be the one I want
Can't help it
I don't want your love no more (No more, no more, no more)
It's not what I'm looking for (Oh)
I don't want your love no more (Oh)
If you can't be the one I want
Baby, I'm gone

[Post-Chorus]
Love no more, no more, no more, oh
Love no more, no more, no—
I don't want your love no more, no more, no more, oh
Love no more
Can't help it

[Verse 2]
Say it ain't so
I believed you were my angel
Now you're dancing with the devil
It ain't adding up
Think I had enough, enough

I could see through you (Through you)
You did everything you said you wouldn't do (Do)
You're praying I don't find somebody new (Ah)
I'm trying but I can't help it, can't help it

[Chorus]
I don't want your love no more (No more, no more, no more)
It's not what I'm looking for (Oh)
I don't want your love (Oh)
If you can't be the one I want
Can't help it
I don't want your love no more (Yeah)
It's not what I'm looking for (Oh)
I don't want your love no more (Oh)
If you can't be the one I want
Baby, I'm gone

[Post-Chorus]
Love no more, no more, no more, oh
Love no more, no more, no—
I don't want your love no more, no more, no more, oh
Love no more
Can't help it
I don't want your2Embed
