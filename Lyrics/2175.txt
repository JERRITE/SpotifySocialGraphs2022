Say OK Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, woah-oh-woah

[Verse 1]
You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit na√Øve with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
I feel sparks

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna be into you if you're not lookin' for true love
Oh, woah
No, I don't wanna start seein' you if I can't be your only one
So, tell me
[Chorus]
When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

[Post-Chorus]
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay (Say okay)

[Verse 2]
When you call, I don't know if I should pick up the phone every time (Time)
I'm not like all my friends, who keep callin' up the boys
I'm so shy (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna be into you if you don't treat me the right way
See, I can only start seein' you if you can make my heart feel safe
Feel safe

[Chorus]
When it's not alright (Not alright)
When it's not okay (Not okay)
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Don't run away

[Bridge]
Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away, so
Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me close and say

[Chorus]
When it's not alright (Not alright)
When it's not okay (Not okay)
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

[Post-Chorus]
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay (Say okay)
Don't run away (Yeah, yeah) (Say okay)
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say okay?
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say okay?3Embed
