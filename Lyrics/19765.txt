WiFi Password Incorrect Lyrics[Intro: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Well it is good to be back with my brothers, my family
Hustle my way through this life
Keep on handin' me cash, now I got all these bands on me
Bag full of weed, keep on stranding me, try understanding me
Smoke half an O, now I look like a manatee, uh
Hoes keep on fanning me, yeah, they know $now like it cold
Like a cup full of ice, keep on pourin' that tangerine
Hop on my dick like a trampoline
Plan on me kicking you out, here's some money for gasoline
Bitch thought I love her, but that was a fantasy, I was just practicin'
Managing vanity, causing insanity
Look at my gun like you reading a magazine
Blow off your head, now the back of it look like a galaxy
Suffer from apathy, still never catching me, uh
[Bridge: $LICK $LOTH]
Flex, $ui, flex (G–)

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
G*59, $uicide
Just a junkie who won't die
Fight or flight, bet I might
Shoot a fuckboy face tonight
These hoes be throwing pussy, but I couldn't fuck her if I tried
Just pass her to my cousin, let him bust that fuckin' bitch's spine, hoe
Just made five racks in a week, still on the floor tryna sleep
*59 be rolling so deep, criminals just tryna eat
How the fuck is you saying we fronting?
Pentagrams is what I trust in
If I got the heron, then I'm ducking
Sippin' lean tryna act like you druggin'

[Verse 3: Black Smurf]
Haha, awaken to bitches and drugs
Two hunnid a buzz, I’m fallin' and unconscious
I rarely remember what was before, like fuck
She’s covered in ashes and mud
Shooting the fuck up with her and I’m not really in the type of mood to talk
Sit there—it lessens
I’m faded the blunt
Got her mad 'cause I don’t play when she’s playing to off
Smoke back to back 'til the bitch give out
She sucks 'til her jaws and knees give out
1-800-HUSTLE, you can reach me now
[?] making my groupie shout
Eating on Ramen, I sat on the couch
Mercedes 4 door I’m counting pounds
Delete minus signs on the [?] now
Ain’t no interruption—the time is nowYou might also like7Embed
