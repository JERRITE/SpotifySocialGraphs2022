White Lies Lyrics[Refrain]
I'm pickin' up really sketch vibes
My woman's been tellin' me lies
About other men
About where she's been hangin'

[Verse 1]
Suspicious thoughts in my mind
Been brewin' up over time
"He's just a friend,"
When to me he's a stranger
[Pre-Chorus]
I can hold no evidence
But I can't think emotionless
And somethin' in your choice of dress
Tonight can lead to just one guess

[Chorus]
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen

[Verse 2]
It's been keepin' me up every night
Most of the time
I toss and turn in bed and I try
Not to explode when you arrive
Sneakin' through the door
Like it ain't 5
Like this house ain't mine

[Refrain]
Yes I been pickin' up really sketch vibes
And I keep lookin' over at your side
Wonderin' where you been
Thinkin' that he ain't a friend
Knowin' that thoughts are a sin
And so I'll say it again
You might also like[Chorus]
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen

[Refrain]
I'm pickin' up really sketch vibes
My woman's been tellin' me lies
About other men
About where she's been hangin'

[Chorus]
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen
White lies you try
Can't blind my eyes
You got your red dress on and you want to play
Like I can't know things that I've never seen20Embed
