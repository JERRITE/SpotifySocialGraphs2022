Girl Who Does Both Lyrics[Verse 1]
21st century modern
A contemporary girl
They don't come around often
But I want one and she's her
She could be on the west end
In a sequins dress of gold
Going out with your best friends
Well, at the pub, she can hold her own

[Pre-Chorus]
Some girls like to paint the town
But some girls stay at home
I want a girl who does both
[Chorus]
Sophisticated type
You know what you like
We'll go there every night
I'm just along for the ride
For such a dirty mind
You clean up pretty nice (Nice)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm nеver going back, never going back
Nеver going back, back
'Cause ordinary love, ordinary love
Could only be half that

[Verse 2]
I want a trivia genius
Who knows everything I don't
She got plenty of secrets
With answers I will only know

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, some lads like to shop around
But this one here is sold
I want a girl who does both

[Chorus]
Sophisticated type
You know what you like
We'll go there every night
I'm just along for the ride
For such a dirty mind
You clean up pretty nice, nice, nice
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I'm never going back, never going back
Never going back, back
'Cause ordinary love, ordinary love
Could only be half that

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Some girls like to paint the town
But some girls stay at home
I've got a girl who does bothEmbed
