Strange Religion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you stay here next to me?
We'll just keep driving
Because of you I see a light
The Buick's a Century
A '73 like you
Some strange religion

[Verse 2]
I get my hands on some money, mama
And it's shot in a night
Stared down the past and just scarred my eyes
Now I know there's no easy ride
She's been the kind who would take it in stride
Some jack of diamonds kicked her heart around
Did they know they were walking on holy ground?
[Bridge 1]
I almost called it a day so many times
Didn't know what it felt like to be alive
Until you been a friend to me
Like nobody else could be

[Verse 3]
Keep my hands on the wheel now, mama
I'm gonna honestly try
She looked past the scars and the burned-out eyes
And could see I'm no easy ride
She's just the kind who might get you to buy
Some strange religion

[Bridge 2]
These jacks of diamonds kicked her heart around
Should have known they were walking on holy ground
And this life might eventually just be the end of me
And I'll still be with you

[Coda]
Can you get in next to me?
I just keep driving
Because of you I've been alive
And this Buick's a Century
A '73 like you
Some strange religion
The Buick's a Century
A '73 like you
Some strange religionYou might also like1Embed
