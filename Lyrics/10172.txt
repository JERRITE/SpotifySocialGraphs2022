Jericho Beach Lyrics[Verse 1]
I grew up when TV changed
Jesus saves and runs away
Carson got his fifteen minutes
For being friends with the kid who did it
And I have dreams where
I'm still trying to park at Jericho Beach

[Pre-Chorus]
I got out and ran away
Nobody came, nobody
[Chorus]
After all this waiting, seismic renovation
Gutted out the whole thing, but kept the presentation
So I figured I could probably do the same

[Verse 2]
You pick me up, it's far away
You need me for the carpool lane
I'm obsessed with what you're saying
"Take me out tonight" is playing
And I can't believe you
And you won't convince me either way

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be yours until we're dead
You said it first, you said it

[Chorus]
After all this waiting, I was gonna save it
I was only practice, you were gonna waste it
So I figured I should wake up and walk home

[Bridge]
But the pavement is a portal
Then I'm sixteen, and I don't know
How to handle being mortal
Being rivals on the ride home
Staying somewhere that you don't know
But I'm still trying
And I'm still trying
And I'm still trying
You might also like[Outro]
I thought you wanted me this way (And I'm still trying)
And I'm still trying
I thought you wanted me this way
(I thought you wanted me this way)
I thought you wanted me this way
(I thought you wanted me this way)
I thought you wanted me this way
I thought you wanted me this way
I thought you wanted me this wayEmbed
