Die Happy Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time

[Verse 1]
I met a girl, she had expensive perfume
Was a waste of money, didn't smell so lovely like you
And now you're on my steps up late night
Chain smoking Pall Malls while I philosophize

[Pre-Chorus]
Glass sky, killin' time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind
[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

[Verse 2]
And I've been burned, yeah, and I've burned myself
Saw no point in falling just to burn somebody else
But now your dreams are catching my eye
Maybe we could stay up and pretend for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
Glass sky, killing time
You leaned upon my shoulder
And my thoughts dried, didn't mind

[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Die happy, die happy
You might also like[Bridge]
And in the darkness, we leave our bodies
Leave our bodies, so alive

[Chorus]
So alive, I felt like I could die happy for a moment
Happy 'cause you stole my spare time
Yeah, I could die now that I've been floating
High upon the smoke in your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Die happy, die happy
Die happy, die happy1Embed
