Have You Ever? Lyrics[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You do anything, to make them understand
Have you ever had someone, steal your heart away
You give anything, to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start?!
[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever), (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd just about anything, to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one, you've given your heart to
Only to find that one, won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait, for the day when they will care!

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
(Makes you wanna break down and cry)
Have you, have you ever needed something (So, so bad)
(So bad you can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't, come out right, (Oh)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever ever, (Oh)

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand, how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
'Cause, baby, I can't sleep

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you, have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
(Brakes your bones inside)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right! (Oh)

Have you ever
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (Just can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? (Don't come out right)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever
Oh, have you ever?11Embed
