[Verse 1]
When I first laid eyes on you
When I heard your heartbeat too
Oh I never knew, I could witness an angel so beautiful
From the very moment you arrived I felt something new inside
I developed a love that was so unconditional

[Chorus]
And I promise to give you everything that I have
There's not a dream in this world you can't accomplish or grasp
I will cross any ocean before I let you land
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go

[Verse 2]
I'll never let nobody hurt you
Give you the world 'cause you deserve it
Teach you how to treat a woman
Let you know you're gonna be something great
I want for you to shine so bright
Know you can do anything through Christ
I see that there is a star inside you
I'm so glad you're in my life

[Chorus]
And I promise to give you everything that I have
There's not a dream in this world you can't accomplish or grasp
I will cross any ocean before I let you land
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go

Hold on to my hand
Never let it go
Ooh ooh, yeah
Son hold on to my hand
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hold on to my hand, never let it go
Just hold on to mama's hand and never let it go (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hold on to my hand (woah oh, oh, oh, oh)
Son hold on to my hand, never let it go, woah, oh, oh, oh
