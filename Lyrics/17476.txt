Best Part Missing Lyrics[Verse 1]
One day you promised to me that
You'd stay forever till the end
But honestly I can't stand the way
You're playing games with me and my feelings
I'm not sure if that's what I needed
But it's cool 'cause we all make mistakes
Yeah I was just hoping that you'd ever change your mind

[Chorus]
I wouldn't have let you go
If you would've let me know
That you could've been my everything
But you put love on hold
I hope that it's not too late
At least it is not for me
Whatever it takes I'll pave the way
For you to walk right home
The bеst part I'm missing is you
Yeah, you're the bеst part I'm missing
[Drop]
You're the best part I'm missing
You're the best part I'm missing

[Verse 2]
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle
This blind space, it leaves me no result
I can't change the way I've been missing you

[Bridge]
So I'm gonna pray to find a way again
There's so much at stake but don't you hold it in
I want to know what it feels like
The time with you and I

[Chorus]
I wouldn't have let you go
If you would've let me know
That you could've been my everything
But you put love on hold
I hope that it's not too late
At least it is not for me
Whatever it takes I'll pave the way
For you to walk right home
The best part I'm missing is you
Yeah, you're the best part I'm missing

You're the best part I'm missing
You're the best part I'm missingEmbed
