Peace Sign LyricsOh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh ohh

[Verse 1]
Well, it's strange my head is rememberin'
How the airplane flying overhead
Looks so effortless, but I cannot guess
Why it lingers in my mind
Evening after this, I'm a crying mess
And to be stronger now, my only wish
So I can finally have the bravery
So I can reach on up to the sky
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This cruel fate engraving
It's carved into the stone
Hoping it reveals itself all to me and then I will
Know just where to go
This moment, this moment
I know that I can breathe
Hanging on a feeling... believe in
My only meaning!

[Chorus]
I hear a voice a' calling, telling me to risk it
Asking if I have been going the distance
Singing with a passion that I cannot deny
My eyes are swollen with the tears that I've been crying
But, to the rest of the world, ever-smiling
Singing for the courage that I'm dying to show!

With my peace sign up when I say goodbye
Write a story of a hero!

[Verse 2]
I didn't want to say I protected you
And you were never weak, I'm number two
You were stronger than I have ever been
And you mean more to me than you know
I have changed myself since the day I yelled
About how you go on by yourself
So if you have to laugh, I should tell you that
I'm afraid that I'm all alone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm kicking, I'm biting
Impossible to breathe
Going down below the depths of my troubled head
And I can feel my stomach heave
I see it, I need it
It calms the blood that beats
If only I could touch it, enough that
It's mine for keeping

[Chorus]
I hear a voice a' calling, telling me to risk it
Asking if I have been going the distance
Singing with a passion that I cannot deny
My eyes are swollen with the tears that I've been crying
But, to the rest of the world, ever-smiling
Singing for the courage that I'm dying to show!

With my peace sign up when I say goodbye
Write a story of a hero!

[Bridge]
Those days gettin' rowdy, gettin' bloody, I was
All scraped, gettin' worn and gettin' dirty, now I
Hear you talkin' and it all is coming back
I see it in my mind - my memories revived
I could apologize for sleeping in a chrysalis and
With every passing night, I wish that I was leaving it and
I swear that I'll be back again!

Oh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh ohh
Oh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh
Oh, woah, ohh

[Chorus]
I hear a voice a' calling, telling me to risk it
Asking if I have been going the distance
Singing with a passion that I cannot deny
My eyes are swollen with the tears that I've been crying
But, to the rest of the world, ever-smiling
Singing for the courage that I'm dying to show!

With my peace sign up when I say goodbye
Write a story of a hero!
With my peace sign up when I say goodbye
Write a story of a hero!4Embed
