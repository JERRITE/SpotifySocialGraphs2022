TranslationsChina Anne McClain - Night Is Young (Tradução em Português)Night Is Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why you standin' over there
Actin' like you just don't care
We can make our own kinda  music

We might come from different worlds
Might not be your kinda girl
But I just wanna let go and lose it

[Pre-Chorus]
We are lost and found
So let's go turn the beat around
And maybe find a brand new sound
Let's turn it up right now (now, now)
[Chorus 1]
Because the night is young (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And it's just begun (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Let's get it started, get it started
And go 'til the sun comes up
The night is young (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
The night is yoou-ou-ou-oung
The night is young

[Verse 2]
Dance together, dance alone
Let it out or let it show
Changin' colors under the strobe light

I just wanna have some fun
Let my worries come undone
Right here, right now it's feelin' so right

[Pre-Chorus]
We are lost and found
So let's go turn the beat around
And maybe find a brand new sound
Let's turn it up right now (now, now)

[Chorus 1]
Because the night is young (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And it's just begun (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Let's get it started, get it started
And go 'til the sun comes up
The night is young (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
The night is yoou-ou-ou-oung
The night is young
You might also like[Bridge]
And I wish that it would never end
I wish this song could play and play
Be who you want to be and then
Just let the rhythm take away

[Chorus + Breakdown]
Because the night is young
And it's just begun
Let's get it started, get it started
And go 'til the sun comes up

[Chorus 2]
Because the night is young (ooh, the night is young, ye-yeah)
And it's just begun (it's just begun)
Let's get it started, get it started
And go 'til the sun comes up
The night is young (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
The night is yoou-ou-ou-oung
The night is young
