Love at First Sight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one of those days, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

[Pre-Chorus]
And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

[Verse 2]
Was tired of running out of luck
Thinking 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

[Pre-Chorus]
And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

[Bridge]
Everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight, love at first sight
Love, ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

[Outro]
It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love7Embed
