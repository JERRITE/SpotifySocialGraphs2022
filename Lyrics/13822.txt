I was a fool to love
I was a fool to love you

Hey lonely
Sorry, but I'm leaving you, my friend
You don't own me
On back and teasing me again
Again, again, yeah yeah yeah, -gain
Again, again, again, yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
And I begged ya
Hide from me this pleasure over pain
But who loved ya?
Insisting but, it rains on me again
Again, again, yeah yeah yeah, -gain
Again, again, again

[Chorus]
I was a fool to love you (I was a fool to love)
