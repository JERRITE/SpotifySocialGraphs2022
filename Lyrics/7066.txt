Unconditional (Sonny Fodera Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sat in your car in my driveway
Where did we lose the time?
We were just living for Fridays
When I could call you mine
When I could only see blue
You taught me to swim
And when you didn't have to
You took me in

[Pre-Chorus]
If we can make it, make it
Make it all possible
Then we can take it, take it
Take it and have it all
[Chorus]
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional

[Verse 2]
I'd leave yours only wanting more
And count the pavement stones
You cut me a key for the front door
So I could call it home
When I could only see blue
You taught me to swim, yeah
And when you didn't have to
You took me in

[Pre-Chorus]
If we can make it, make it
Make it all possible
Then we can take it, take it
Take it and have it all
You might also like[Chorus]
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional

[Outro]
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditional
This is unconditionalEmbed
