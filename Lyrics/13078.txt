Romantic Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
She’s a killer
Looking at ya
She’s my type
Very nice to meet ya

She’s a killer
One look is all it takes
She’s a killer
And she took my breath away

Romantic lover
There is no other
She is my lover

I need her
I gotta see her
Pullin up on you girl

She’s a killer
I love her features
A perfect picture
Very nice to meet ya
