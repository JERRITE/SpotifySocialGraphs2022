Player of Games Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby
Would you still love me
Out on Europa
Or will you forget? La, la, la, la
Baby
How can I compare
To the adventure out there?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sail away
To the cold expanse of space
Even love
Couldn't keep you in your place
But can't you love me
Like that?
Can't you need me
Like that?
[Chorus]
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay
But he has to be the best
Player of games
If I loved you any less
I'd make you stay
Player of games
Player of games

[Post-Chorus]
Player of games
Player of games
Player of gamеs
Player of games

[Verse 2]
I'm in love
With thе greatest gamer
But he'll always love the game
More than he loves me (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sail away
To the cold expanse of space (Ah)
Even love
Couldn't keep you in your place
But can't you love me
Like that?
Can't you need me
Like that?
You might also like[Chorus]
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay
But he has to be the best
Player of games
If I loved him any less
I'd make him stay
Player of games
Player of games

[Post-Chorus]
Player of games
