How am I supposed to feel
When you're telling me that nothing in my life is real?
When you throw your words and hide behind a plastic shield
I just sit and smile

[Verse 2]
Writing my own fairytales
Building forts between the sofa and the windowsill
Dreaming of the day I'm tall enough to save myself
But I was just a child
[Pre-Chorus]
What it takes to recognize
Emotions that I try to hide
The more I keep them all inside
The more they bury me alive

[Chorus]
All my life, I've felt out of place
All my life, I've been saving face
Well, all these minor feelings
Are majorly breaking me down (Breaking me down)
All my life, you took me for a fool
All my life, you told me what to do
All these minor feelings
Are majorly getting to me nowYou might also likeEmbed
