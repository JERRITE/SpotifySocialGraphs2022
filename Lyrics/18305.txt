Again Lyrics[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Yo, yo
And when me say, me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Run go tell your bredrin, me say run go tell your friend
We are the remedy, I wheel up the ting
Me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Understand I know you like it (Hear them call out)
Pull it up and rewind it
[Verse 1: Ms Banks]
Aye, yo, they ain't ever badder than me
You ain't ever met a realer killer MC
Name hold weight, that's a hundred MT
Lick off a shot and leave the clip empty
How you mean? How you mean?
You ain't messing with the team
Bruddas loving off my ting, they see me in their dreams
Busting out the jeans, get it popping like the seam
Laser beam, laser beam
You ain't messing with the team

[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Yo, yo
And when me say, me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Run go tell your bredrin, me say run go tell your friend
We are the remedy, I wheel up the ting
Me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Understand I know you like it (Hear them call out)
Pull it up and rewind it

[Bridge]
(Soundboy)
Let it go, let it go
Let it go

Boom
Every time they see me when I step into the room
Pulling out the camera, see the flash and do the zoom
You know it's a madness when I'm mashing up the tune
Blud I'll spin your favourite rapper, man I'll send him to the moon
Long long time, good to see you, see you soon
Still a rapper, still a actor, been a trapper, been a goon
Diss me by the morning, they won't live to see the noon
Va-va-voom, va-va-voom

[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Yo, yo
And when me say, me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Run go tell your bredrin, me say run go tell your friend
We are the remedy, I wheel up the ting
Me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Understand I know you like it (Hear them call out)
Pull it up and rewind it

[Verse 3: Ms Dynamite]
See me, me, me, me, see the eat, gyal all come
See me, me, me, me, [?]
So calm down, you don't really want no [?]
And you don't wanna take this ting too far now
[Hook: Ms Dynamite]
Yo, yo
And when me say, me say again
Long long time, me no come-a-come again
Every time me touch up on the riddim, problem
Run go tell your bredrin, me say run go tell your friend
We are the remedy, I wheel up the tingEmbed
