Messy bitch who lives for drama

[Verse 1]
I love robbery and fraud, I'm a shoplifting God
Bitch, I'm never gonna teach you every scam that I got
Watch your purse around me 'cause I'll snatch it up like that
Use your EBT card for a taco and some snacks (Mmm)
I used to fuck for money but I found something better
When I steal credit cards, shit, nothing makes me wetter
I sell bundles out my trunk with the counterfeit shoes
I got Bucci, I got Louis V and even Jimmy Poo
I'm in your Instagram comments just looking for a victim
Make them hit me on my DMs, bitch, that's when I get 'em
Gift card flipping turn a hundred to a thousand
And you never know what hit you
'Til you spoke with your accountant (Uh)

Ooh-ooh, you don't wanna come for me
No, ma'am, you don't wanna come for me

[Verse 2]
I got pepper spray for you hoes who wanna message me
'Talmbout "Hey Prada, when you gonna wire money to me?"
Girl, bye, only person spending money is me
Girl, get your own gigs, stop coming for mine
I'm a self-made thousandaire, never did time
You gotta have a attitude, bitch, you can't be no dork
You gotta start talking, stop walking
Like them city boys from New York
Get a new name and cover your tracks
And if ya niggas in it too, bitch, cover their backs
You need new IDs, new cars every week
If the cops ask questions just shh, don't speak
