Pay No Mind (feat. Passion Pit) [Yasutaka Nakata ‘CAPSULE’ Remix] Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was dancing, she was smiling
Roses blooming in her cheeks
In a quiet kind of litany
She accepted some defeat
And then she twirled into the arms
Of disgrace, and then repelled
Now, she's fallen to her knees
But you couldn't ever tell

[Pre-Chorus]
And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her, "I don't know!"
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and breathe
[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind

[Verse 2]
Let it burn, as if we'd bothered
We'll make sound based off their eyes
As she closes, just to open
As the sirens whirling by
And now she's off to tell her secret
To a friend somewhere in town
And her friend just takes a moment
And asks why I'm not around
Darling, this is something
I should have told you long ago
I just want you to feel safe
I just want to make you glow
Oh, how you glowed when we were young
And with nothing on our minds
But each other, one another
And we had nothing then but time

[Pre-Chorus]
And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her, "I don't know!"
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and breathe
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind

[Bridge]
Some days you hear it (don't listen, honey)
Some days you don't (don't listen, oh no)
Sometimes you feel it (it's not worth it, honey)
Sometimes you won't
Just calm yourself, and breathe

[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mindEmbed
