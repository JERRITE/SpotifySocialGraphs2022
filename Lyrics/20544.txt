Feel Good (Itâ€™s Alright) Lyrics[Verse 1: Karen Harding]
You are my addiction
I will love you with precision
Every night, every night
Cause whenever you are here
All my worries disappear
I don't know why, I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus: Karen Harding]
You give me something I can't explain
When you touch my body, mind goes insane
Baby you do it every time
And I can't get you out my mind
I guess it's not much more I really need to say
[Chorus: Karen Harding]
You make me feel good, like a melody
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, you're my medicine
You make me feel good, it's alright

[Verse 2: Karen Harding]
You are my addiction
I will love you with precision
Every night, every night
Oh, you got my heart and soul
And I am half, you make me whole
So glad you're mine, so glad you're mine

[Pre-Chorus: Karen Harding]
You give me something I can't explain
When you touch my body, mind goes insane
Baby you do it every time
And I can't get you out my mind
I guess it's not much more I really need to say

[Chorus: Karen Harding]
You make me feel good, like a melody
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, you're my medicine
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, like a melody
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, you're my medicine
You make me feel good, it's alright

Who knows how to make me feel good

[Chorus: Karen Harding]
You make me feel good, like a melody
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, you're my medicine
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, like a melody
You make me feel good, it's alright
You make me feel good, you're my medicine
You make me feel good, it's alright1Embed
