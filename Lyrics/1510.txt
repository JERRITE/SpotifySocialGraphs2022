Call Me a Quitter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe, maybe
Maybe I'm a little too comfortable
I dropped, I dropped
I might've dropped the ball and then let it roll
(Five, four, three, two)

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three
Another glass of wine where she don't speak
Five, six, seven
Even though it's nice, it's hardly heaven
[Chorus]
I could love her just a little bit better
(Love her just a little bit)
'Cause if I don't, someone's gonna come along and get her
(Gon' come along)
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody can call me, call me a quitter
(I'm not a quitter, quitter)
I should love her just a little bit better
A little bit better

[Verse 2]
I know, I know
She's becoming part of the furniture
And if I take a seat back and ask myself
If I am doing enough, then I'm probably not (Three, two)

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three
Another glass of wine where she don't speak
Five, six, seven
Even though it's nice, it's hardly heaven

[Chorus]
I could love her just a little bit better
(Love her just a little bit)
'Cause if I don't, someone's gonna come along and get her
(Someone just a little)
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody can call me, call me a quitter
(Call me a quitter, quitter)
I should love her just a little bit better
A little bit better

La-la, la-la-la-la-la (I'm not a quitter)
La-la, la-la-la-la-la (Don't call me a quitter)
La-la, la-la-la-la-la (I'm not a quitter)
La-la, la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody can call me, call me a quitter
(Call me a quitter, quitter, quitter)
I should love her just a little bit better
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody can call me, call me a quitter
(Call me a quitter, a quitter)
Oh, I should love her just a little bit better, a little bit betterEmbed
