Right Here With You Lyrics[Verse 1: Jon Steingard]
Chaos all around
Feel You reaching out
Your hand touches mine
And the hand of time stops
Feels like letting go
Losing my control
Breathing in and out
Getting closer now
I keep falling deeper
I keep falling deeper
[Chorus: Jon Steingard & MDSN]
Right here, right here with You
Forever's a moment
Right here, right here with You
Is taking me over
I keep falling deeper
Your love keeps taking me higher

[Verse 2: Jon Steingard, & MDSN Both]
All my fears dissolve
Come take what You want
All these walls are down
Getting closer now
I keep falling deeper
Yeah, I keep falling deeper

[Chorus: Jon Steingard & MDSN]
Right here, right here with You
Forever's a moment
Right here, right here with You
Is taking me over
I keep falling deeper
Your love keeps taking me higher

[Bridge: Jon Steingard]
And I know
You're right beside me wherever I go (oh, whoa)
And I know
You're right beside me wherever I go (oh, whoa)
Oh-whoa-oa
Oh-whoa-oa
Oh-whoa-oa
Oh-whoa-oa

Right here, right here with You
Touching the heavens
Right here, right here with You
Here in the presence
I keep falling deeper
Your love keeps taking me higher

[Refrain: Jon Steingard & MDSN]
Oh-whoa-oa
Your love keeps taking me higher
(Your love keeps taking me higher!)
Your love keeps taking me higher1Embed
