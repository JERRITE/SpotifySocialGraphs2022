TranslationsPortuguÃªsSlip Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't hold back, I want to break free
God is singing through your body
And I'm carried by the sound
Every drum, every single beat
They were born from your body
And I'm carried by the sound

[Chorus]
Oh, ooh, love
They'll never break the shape we take
Oh, ooh
Baby, let all them voices slip away
[Verse 2]
Don't look back, I want to break free
If you'll never see 'em coming
You'll never have to hide
Take my hand, take my everything
If we only got a moment
Give it to me now

[Chorus]
Oh, ooh, love
They'll never break the shape we take
Oh, ooh
Baby, let all them voices slip away

[Breakdown]
No caressing, no caressing
No caressing, no caressing
No caressing, no caressing
No caressing, no caressing, no

[Chorus]
Oh, ooh, love
They'll never break the shape we take
Oh, ooh, no, love
They'll never break the shape we take
Oh, ooh, love, love
They'll never break the shape we take
Oh, ooh
Baby, let all them voices slip awayYou might also like12Embed
