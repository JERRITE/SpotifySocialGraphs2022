Swan Dive Lyrics[Intro]
Skressing
Neilaworld
Sick of rapping about this, yeah
But whatchu know about this, yeah
Maybe I'll get rich, yeah
Maybe my head splits, yeah
And I don't even know you, yeah
Act like I owe you, yeah
But I done told you, yeah
Swan dive roll through, yeah
[Verse 1]
Don't know where I'm going
Rot in my core
Your hate means nothing I hate myself more
What is this for?
I can't take you to the top cause you were not with me when I slept on the floor
So I'll-

[Chorus]
Swan dive, hurricane washing my pain away
Swan dive, king to reign made a blade renegade
Swan dive, Ponyboy staying gold never change
Swan dive, full of hope, do and don't, stay the same

[Verse 2]
You're right
I lied
I know that I can't erase my sins
I'm fine, inside, so why can't I seem to let you in?
Why can't I seem to let you in?
Never really loved the man I been
Never really kept my word but I'll run away
Things caged and kept from you

[Chorus]
Swan dive, hurricane washing my pain away
Swan dive, king to reign made a blade renegade
Swan dive, Ponyboy staying gold never change
Swan dive, full of hope, do and don't, stay the same

Sick of rapping about this, yeah
But whatchu know about this, yeah
