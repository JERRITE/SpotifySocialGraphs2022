Scooby Doo Theme Song Lyrics[Chorus]
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We got some work to do now
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now

[Verse]
Come on Scooby Doo, I see you
Pretending you got a sliver
But you're not fooling me, 'cause I can see
The way you shake and shiver
[Bridge]
You know we got a mystery to solve
So, Scooby Doo, be ready for your act
Don't hold back
And, Scooby Doo, if you come through
You're gonna have yourself a Scooby snack
That's a fact

[Chorus]
Scooby Dooby Doo, here are you
You're ready and you're willing
If we can count on you, Scooby Doo
I know we'll catch that villainYou might also likeEmbed
