Polymorphing Lyrics[Chorus]
There's something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, kid, kid

[Verse 1]
I could not be more forgiving
Cutting Lucy, fancy living
Sticky-shifting, polymorphing
Sound the guns when we're together
Shake a rainstick at the weather
Take the day off, I surrender
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darling
If this heart was a card, would you deal it?
If this life was a pulse, would you feel it?
If this love was a wound, would you heal it?
(Or just make it better)

[Chorus]
There's something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, tonight
Something better than what you're asking for
Kid, kid, kid, kid

[Verse 2]
Fill 'er up with serotonin
Pyrotechnic, oxytocin
I'm overdosing, polymorphing
Innocence within a warzone
Undercover, in the ozone
Bungee jumping, on the upswing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darling
If this heart was a card, would you deal it?
If this life was a pulse, would you feel it?
If this love was a wound, would you heal it?
You might also like[Chorus]
There's something better than what you're
Something better than what you're
Better than, better than, night
Kid, kid, kid, kid
There's something better than what you're
Something better than what you're
Better than, better than, night
Kid, kid, kid, kid

[Bridge]
Hi, hi!
Polymorphing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, darling
If this heart was a card, would you deal it?
If this life was a pulse, would you feel it?
If this love was a wound, would you heal it?
Or just make it better or something

[Chorus]
There's something better than what you're
I do better than what you're
I do better than what you're
There's something better than what you're
I do better than what you're
Night
There's something better than what you're
I do better than what you're
Night
Kid, kid, kid, kid
[Outro]
