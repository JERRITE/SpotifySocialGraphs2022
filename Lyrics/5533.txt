Dare You To Doubt Me Lyrics[Chorus]
I dare you to doubt me
Say it can't be done
I ain't gonna stop
Till the air's left my lungs
Say I don't belong here
Tell me that I'm wrong
And you're gonna see
I dare you to doubt me

[Verse 1]
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me
[Verse 2]
Take the pain and turn it into fire
Standing on the hurt you gon' be reaching even higher
Living every moment like you're dying with dеsire
Gotta go through hell beforе you're hearing Heaven's choirs, so

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to always do my best, yes
In anything and everything you know I'm obsessed
This my life, I know that I am blessed
God put me in the room, I'll do the rest, yes

[Chorus]
I dare you to doubt me
Say it can't be done
I ain't gonna stop
Till the air's left my lungs
Say I don't belong here
Tell me that I'm wrong
And you're gonna see
I dare you to doubt me

[Verse 1]
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me

If you can see it, then you can be it
I know if you speak it, believe it, then you'll receive it
There are lonely roads we go down following a feeling
But if it's not worth fighting for, then it's got no meaning
All I know is I try with everything I've got, yeah
Wearing all the scars from all the battles that I fought
You know that I, I, I'm dangerous when I'm down
But never ever count me out

[Chorus]
I dare you to doubt me
Say it can't be done
I ain't gonna stop
Till the air's left my lungs
Say I don't belong here
Tell me that I'm wrong
And you're gonna see
I dare you to doubt me

[Post-Chorus]
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me
[Verse 4]
I know I'm strong 'cause I've been weak
Was at war with myself, won the battle and I found peace
You can take the L 'cause the W is all me
And now you can't take your eyes off me (Get off me)
I know I'm not perfect, I fuck up, I tell lies (Tell lies)
Yeah, I make mistakes, but Lord knows that I try (I try)
Yeah, see me when I stumble, I fall, I get back up, stand tall
Stone by stone, brick by brick, I'm climbing up that wall till I

[Outro]
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me (I'm never gonna stop, no)
Till I'm at the top, at the top, at the top, yeah
Never gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop me (Never gonna stop, never gonna stop me)
(Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop)
I dare you to doubt meEmbed
