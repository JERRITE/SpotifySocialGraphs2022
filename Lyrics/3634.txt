TranslationsTürkçePandora’s Box Lyrics[Verse 1]
You almost turned me psycho
I almost lost my mind
I didn't know the depth yet
Of someone so unkind
Someone who was special
In every other way (Mm-mm)
You damaged what we had
But for her, it's just another day

[Chorus]
You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth, we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost
[Verse 2]
I've escaped many vices
Like drugs and alcohol
But I can never escape
The war inside my skull
You know that lovе's a gift
But it can also be a curse (Mm-mm)
Always the optimist
Dеaling with somebody else's can of worms

[Chorus]
You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth, we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost

[Bridge]
Yeah, I thought it would get better
I kept my hope alive
But I don't wanna be the bearer
Of pain just so we can survive
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth, we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost

[Outro]
I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost9Embed
