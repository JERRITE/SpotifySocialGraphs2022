Greatest Day LyricsToday this could be the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Letâ€™s make a new start
The future is ours to find
Can you see it? Can you see it in my eyes?
Can you feel it now? Can you hold it in your arms tonight?
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (Tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh, stay close to me (Hold on)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close me

Oh, hold your head high (Hold on)
Arms open wide
Yeah, the world starts to come alive
When you stay close to me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oh, and the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
Oh, oh, oh
Stay close to me (And the world comes alive)
Hold on
Stay close to me (And the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (Hold on)
Oh (Stay close to me), and the world comes alive
(Stay close to me) and the world comes alive
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me
Oh, oh, ohYou might also likeEmbed
