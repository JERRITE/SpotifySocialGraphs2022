Broken Heels (Single Mix) Lyrics[Intro]
He-he-hey, he-he-hey
RedOne, you know I can do it better than you
I can do it even better in broken heels

[Chorus]
He-he-hey, he-he-hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels

[Verse 1]
I roll my sleeves up (Up), wrap my hair up (Up)
There's no sign on the road, so I never stop
Can you catch me? Yeah, yеah, yeah
You'll never catch mе, ay, ay, ay
I'm fresh out the box (Box), fast like a fox (Fox)
Boss in my shoes, tick tock, 12 o'clock
You better watch me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sit back and watch me, ay, ay, ay
[Pre-Chorus]
You go hard, yes, you do
But when I go it's a magic show
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I get it when I want it and I get it right

[Chorus]
He-he-hey, he-he-hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken heels
He-he-hey (He-hey), he-he-hey
All the ladies tell the fellas we can do what they can do
We can do it even better in broken, broken heels

[Verse 2]
When you step it up (Up), I'm twenty levels up (Up)
I took the escalator, elevator to the top
How you like me? Yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta like me, ay, ay, ay
Oh, you know we rock (Rock), we control the block (Block)
Whatever's going down, ladies take the biggest cut
We bring the party, yeah, yeah, yeah
We bought the party, ay, ay, ay

[Pre-Chorus]
You go hard, yes, you do
But when I go it's a magic show
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I get it when I want it and I get it right

Anything you can do, I can do better (He-hey)
Boy, I can do it in broken heels
Anything you can do, we can do better
Boy, I can do it in broken, broken heels
