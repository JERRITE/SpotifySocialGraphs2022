Higher Than Before Lyrics[Verse 1: Josh]
We collided out of nowhere
An explosion out the blue
Now there’s a brand new kind of emotion, me and you
Like an arrow in the darkness
At the mercy of the moon
I couldn’t turn back now even if I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus: Josh]
I think that this could be the brightest that we’ve ever burnt before
You lift me up and take me higher than I’ve ever been
This is a brand new kind of emotion, me and you
I couldn’t turn back now even if I wanted to
[Chorus: Josh]
You're taking me higher than before
You're taking me higher than before

[Verse 2: Josh]
It's like I’m breathing under water
Living daydreams like they're true
It’s like you’ve opened every door and I’m walking through
It's like a steam train, on a fast bend
We’ve been waiting around in this permanent queue
I couldn’t turn back now even if I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus: Josh, Mali-Koa & Both]
I think that (Ooh-ooh) this could be the brightest that we’ve ever burnt before
You lift (Ooh-ooh) me up and take me higher than I’ve ever been
This is a brand new kind of emotion, me and you
I couldn’t turn back now even if I wanted to

[Chorus: Josh with Mali-Koa]
You're taking me higher than before
You're taking me higher than before
You're taking me higher than before
(I think that this could be the brightest that we’ve ever burnt before)
You're taking me higher than before
(Oh)

If this is it, if this is us
I’d do anything to keep us fallin' apart
I see the light, can you hear my heart?
(Can you hear my heart, oh?)
We’re moving like a shooting star, and now I’m sure
It’s like I never knew a life before
We take control, now you’re all I know
And now I know I’ll never get so low

[Chorus: Josh, Mali-Koa & Both]
You're taking me higher than before
(I think that this could be the brightest that we’ve ever burnt before)
You're taking me higher than before
(You lift me up and take me higher than I’ve ever been)
You're taking me higher than before
(You're taking me higher, me higher)Embed
