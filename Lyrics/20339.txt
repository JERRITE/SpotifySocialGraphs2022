Shell Shock Lyrics[Verse 1]
I dive a little deeper
Deeper than I ever did
Bone dry, I didn't need ya
But I never said I wasn't in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high to fade away
But further than we've ever been
There's two sides to every face
So show me what I'm looking in
[Chorus]
Hits like a gunshot (Gunshot, gunshot)
Blood runs wild, but my head's held high
Did you hear my heart drop? (Heart drop, heart drop)
I know you did, but you kept your pride
You got me shell-shocked (Shell-shocked, shell-shocked)
Alarms ring off, am I losing time?
Wanna quit but I can't stop (Can't stop, can't stop)
I know you did, and it took your pride

[Build]
I know you did but you kept, kept, kept

[Drop]
I know you did, but you kept your pride

[Verse 2]
You taste a little sweeter
But you left me with a bitterness
I climb a little steeper
To slide into the thick of it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high to fade away
But further than we've ever been
These scars, they always stay
And always pull us back again
You might also like[Chorus]
Hits like a gunshot (Gunshot, gunshot)
Blood runs wild, but my head's held high
Did you hear my heart drop? (Heart drop, heart drop)
I know you did, but you kept your pride
You got me shell-shocked (Shell-shocked, shell-shocked)
Alarms ring off, am I losing time?
Wanna quit but I can't stop (Can't stop, can't stop)
I know you did, and it took your pride

[Build]
I know you did but you kept, kept, kept

[Drop]
I know you did, but you kept your pride1Embed
