Band
Yeah,  yeah

Let the band play

[Chorus: Key Glock & Young Dolph]
Yeah, bitch, I paid the price to rock this ice, uh (Yeah, bitch)
Tell  me, what you niggas know 'bout sacrifice? Uh (Yeah, bitch)
Tell  me, what you niggas know 'bout sacrifice? Yeah
I pray every night 'cause I live one hell of a life, uh
One  hell of a life (Yeah)
Two shows back to back, one hell of a night (Two)
I pick up the check, and then I'm right back on a flight (Gone)
My dawg still on lockdown and he just sent me a kite (Free him)
Okay,  one hell of a life, uh-huh (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Grew up watching my big cousin 'nem cooking up white (White)
Feds did a sweep and the whole neighborhood got indicted (Damn)
Got an old school but it look like a new coupe inside it (Yeah)
No, I'm not from New York, but I'm a motherfuckin' giant (Hey, hey)
Went from havin' nothin' (Uh), to in Dubai shoppin' (Uh)
She got fake tits, she love to walk around topless (Uh)
Independence Day, we pull up and get it popping (Popping)
No time for cheap talking (Uh)

[Verse 2: Key Glock]
No time for cheap talking (Uh-uh)
You know my teeth flawless
Baby, I'ma keep balling (Yeah)
And if you see me driving in it, best believe I bought it, uh (Yeah)
I'm going crazy with this paper, they like, "Key retarded" (Crazy)
Don't become my target (Yeah)
'Cause I'll spark it (Fire)
I came a long way, yesterday, I was robbin'
Robbin' everything, should've changed my name to Robert
Don't go against the grain, I'll put your brains on your collar (Fire)

[Chorus: Key Glock & Young Dolph]
Yeah, bitch, I paid the price to rock this ice, uh (Bitch)
Tell me, what you niggas know 'bout sacrifice? (Bitch)
Yeah, I was up them late mornings and them early nights, uh (Yeah)
Tryna get it right and tryin' not to lose my life (Yeah)
Yeah, bitch, I paid the price to rock this ice, uh (Yeah, bitch)
Tell me, what you niggas know 'bout sacrifice? Uh (Yeah, bitch)
Tell me, what you niggas know 'bout sacrifice? Yeah
I pray every night 'cause I live one hell of a life, uh
One hell of a life (Yeah)
Two shows back to back, one hell of a night (Two)
I pick up the check, and then I'm right back on a flight (Gone)
My dawg still on lockdown and he just sent me a kite (Free him)
Okay, one hell of a life, uh-huh (One hell of a life, yeah)You might also like5Embed
