Iâ€™ll Carry You LyricsHow does it feel
To know that you are loved so much
How does it feel to be accepted
So completely
How does it feel to know that you
Mean everything to someone
How does it feel to know that
You're exactly what i wanted

How does it feel
To know that you are loved
I love you more than you can see
This is everything you are to meYou might also likeEmbed
