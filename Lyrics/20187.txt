I’ll live forever LyricsI lost a friend may 18th, 2012
I lost my mind, spent the whole night in a cell
I jumped a fence and broke my knee on the ground
I saw the end and felt the blood flowing down
I dug a hole in the backyard meant for you
Placed a bet on my own heart: i can’t lose
Oh i can’t lose, oh i can’t lose
My lies feel more like the truth
Can’t get more human than you

[Chorus]
Oh i’ll live forever (x9)
Are you my enemy?
Feel like a friend to me
You have a tendency to waste my timе
Is it a youthful lust?
Is it a truthful love?
Is it me, you or us?
I can’t decidе

Fucking up the love
I wish i could be dead for you, my love
There’s something about
There’s nothing allowed
It’s cold to the touch but i can’t get enough

Sunny day, sunny day
We on the beach, runaway
Lots of sharks
Life is art
Lots of blood (in my heart)

[Chorus]
Oh i’ll live forever (x9)You might also likeEmbed
