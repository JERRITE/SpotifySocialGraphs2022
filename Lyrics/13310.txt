Fill in the Blank Lyrics[Intro]
(What's up, guys?)
(You are now listening to, uh, Car Seat Headrest)

[Verse 1]
I'm so sick of, fill in the blank
Accomplish more, accomplish nothing
If I were split in two, I would just take my fists
So I can beat up the rest of me

[Chorus]
You have no right to be depressed
You haven't tried hard enough to like it
Haven't seen enough of this world yet
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Well, stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain
They're just trying to let some air in
But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it
[Verse 2]
I've known for a long time
I'm not getting what I want out of people
It took me a long time
To figure out I don't know what I want
You'll ask, "Why?", and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask, "For how long?", and there will be no answer
Then you'll ask, "What can I do?", and there will be no answer
And eventually, you will shut up

[Chorus]
You have no right to be depressed
You haven't tried hard enough to like it
Haven't seen enough of this world yet
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Well, stop your whining, try again
No one wants to cause you pain
They're just trying to let some air in
But you hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it

[Bridge]
I get signs
From the cops
Saying, "Stay the fuck down"
I get signs
From the audience
Saying, "Stay the fuck down"
I get signs
From God
Saying, "Stay the fuck down"
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I've got a right to be depressed
(You've got no right to be depressed)
I've given every inch I had to fight it
(You haven't tried hard enough to like it)
I have seen too much of this world, yes
(Haven't seen enough of this world yet)
But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
And I will never see the light
(So stop your whining, try again)
That I've seen shining in your eyes
(No one wants to cause you pain)
You just want to see me naked
(They're just trying to let some air in, but you)
So I'll hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold it
(Hold your breath, you hold your breath, you hold it)
Hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold my breath
I hold my breath, I hold my breath, I hold my breath20Embed
