TranslationsDeutschLose Your Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need to learn
When this thing called love
When it's a mirror, baby
Can you see all those parts of me
Broken across the world?
I need to find some kind of peace of mind
It's a demon, baby
When it comes like my oldest friend
Have you got a friend in the night?
[Chorus]
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

[Verse 2]
There's a place, I see it in your head
Full of evil, baby
Can you see all those parts of me
Broken across the world?

[Chorus]
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
You say you miss me now
What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead
What a way to go to bed
With those thoughts inside your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to go to bed

[Outro]
What a way to lose your head
What a way to lose your head
What a way to go to bed
What a way to get ahead3Embed
