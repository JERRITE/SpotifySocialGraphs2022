I.O.U. One Galaxy LyricsStars are out tonight
And you're the brightest one shining in my sky
It's like every wish I ever made came true
The day I woke up lying next to you

Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours
We could hang out every night
And watch the sun go down
As long as we could watch it rise again
Gave me a valentine
It's these little things that stand the test of time
I've saved the tickets from the shows that we've been to
And a thousand other memories of you

Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours

Gave you this I.O.U. today
It said, "Good for one galaxy"
Once I build my rocket to the stars
We'll fly away, just you and meYou might also likeEmbed
