â€Œechoes in my mind Lyrics[Verse 1: Wiccaphase]
Cry for me, die for me, I know you will
Ease my sorrow I, can't stop what I'm feeling I
Call out your name, touch you by your legs, and I
Know your body song, never been so down this long
Hurt me like it's what I want, I'll be so cruel for you
Wrapped up in your arms again, I do what I have to do
It's all for you
Find me in the night, girl I saw you looking right so
Lead me down the path marked red, I'm in your head again
Lead me down the path marked red, I'm in your head again
[Verse 2: Spooky Black]
Hold me down, baby, I'm beside myself
I need you, listen I plead to
Anything you blame on me I take it in full
All I want is you now, all I see is where you stood, oh
Baby, make your way out of my head and slip
Back into my bed back into my bed
If only you could see me now
Won't you come and see me now
All this time I waste where we used to go
Don't you see my darling, this is pitiful
I need you more than ever now
Oh, where did I go wrong with us I found you
Here I felt, your lust I believed it to be true
I believed it to be trueYou might also like17Embed
