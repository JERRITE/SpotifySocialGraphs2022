Blitz Lyrics[Verse 1]
Getting bored of Walls 2
I should find a new minigame
October 2013, saw the game and I thought
Oh my God, the fuck is this?
So many OP kits
But I guess I'll play a game

[Verse 2]
Horse tamers, every game
Dominating winter all day long
Everybody's kit's the same
Because it is so damn strong
But hey, I can survive
I get better ping here than to the Hive
Teams and hackers everywhere
But nobody plays Blitz, to be fair
[Chorus]
So I’ll keep on playing
And get Horsetamer VI
My horse is fast but stupid
And I will call it Brick
Toxicologist gets added
With a level V stone sword
Keep going with a single dream that
One day I'll be leaderboards
Gonna join another map
But I know it's all in vain
Trying to earn some coins
But it's not worth the pain
Got a long list of level 7s
No high level kits I've gained
Keep getting Rogue'd in deathmatch
That's just the game

[Verse 3]
Hypixel gets a new host
I will miss you, 30 ping
Now it's on the East Coast
But now I only want one thing
To get the YouTube rank
What the fuck, it's 30K subs?
And I join the Elite team

Screaming, crying, horse users
As we nerf their kit to bits
Don’t worry, toxic's next
We'll completely revamp Blitz
Make it a whole new game
While I try and rise to fame
I’ll make for myself a name
When I'm done here, this game will never be the same

[Chorus]
So I release my first montage
Become a rising star
People blame my hit detection
Because of my 5 bar
But it was the first of many, and I buy armorer X
People blame thorns constantly but
I still make one again
I name it Unexpected
Later I release Life
My personal favorite
Flawlesses left and right
But Blitz has some new problems
And this one's pretty dumb
Only one map ever fills up
Why is it Caelum?
[Bridge]
Remove Caelum and replace it with v2
But it's still half the things people queue
So many teams, the forums explode
So we release an update: team mode

[Chorus]
That was my last move
And I leave the Elite Team
People ask me why but
I must follow my dreams
So I guess that marks the end of
My whole nine month regime
But I'm telling you the game is
Better off than it seems
So that was Blitz
It’s been over a year
Nowadays there's nothing
But lots of diamond gear
There's five scouts in each round
It’s getting quite insane
I keep getting janitored but
That's just the game37Embed
