Tati [Travis Barker Remix] Lyrics[Chorus: Gavin Haley]
There's this girl called Tati
I love the way she move in the nighttime, yeah
There's this girl from the valley
I feel like this could last for a lifetime yeah

[Verse 1: Gavin Haley]
Know you got all that you could have them, but you want me
You don't need a fallback, always get a call back, that's all G
So you got a tough side, grew up on a South Side, that's alright
Cause you got a soft side, lemme watch the sunrise from your eyes
[Verse 2: Gavin Haley]
Tati get it if she want to, ah ah
Punch that ticket, it's a nice mood, oh oh
3 am, I always come through, oh oh
She can get it if she want to, oh, say say

[Chorus: Gavin Haley]
Therе's this girl called Tati
I love the way shе move in the nighttime, yeah
There's this girl from the valley
I feel like this could last for a lifetime, yeah

There's this girl called Tati, yeah
I love the way she move in the nighttime, yeah
There's this girl from the valley
I feel like this could last for a lifetime, yeah

[Verse 3: Yung Pinch]
I had met her at the wrong time
She was chillin with the wrong guy
So I had to take her
Left the city on a joy ride
Had to show her round the North Side
Took her from Topanga
And now she in my Benzo
Hanging out the window
Singing in the breeze to Nirvana
Baby a real Primadonna
She know everybody want her
But she like "who me"
Knowin damn well she a diva
A video vixen
It's a pleasure to meet ya
She said "oo-ee"
Winking her eyes at me ya
Ain't gone lie, I need ya
Think I might have to keep ya, girl
