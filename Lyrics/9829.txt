I Gotta Habit Lyrics[Intro]
We 'bout to go in on this one (Mafia)
Travel the waters
You know what I mean?
It's like, we all got that special person we love, you know?
A lil' ride or die, you know?
Let me tell you 'bout mine

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing like a ride or die bitch
She come through and throw the fifty up
Love to fuck, she even roll the piffy up
Who that in the spiffy truck?
Son with the blicky tucked
Federales tried to hit me up, but
My bitch, she nice behind the wheel
I be popping out the window, I'm nicer with the steel
One thing a nigga could say is the heists, they be real
She gon' shoot a nigga dead like she licensed to kill
She always tell her friends about me, the piping is real
Let me control the tempo, baby, 'cause I'm nice with the peel, chill
Uh, I want you on your belly quick
Max is the good side, I'm on my Biggavelli shit
Riding to the party, her thighs touching the shotty
My eyes touching her body, got her high off Bacardi
Uh, bitch had the nerve to take a piss in the lobby
Now she talking 'bout catching a body (What the fuck?)
[Chorus]
'Cause I want you ('Cause I want you, want you, baby)
I gotta have you (Gotta have that thing)
And I need you (And I need you, need you, baby)
It's just like I got a habit
I want you (I want you, I got that fix)
I gotta have you (Need that thing, baby)
And I need you (And I need you, uh)
It's just like I got a habit

[Verse 2]
Now, my baby know I got it under control
Never would she crack under pressure or would she fold (Nope)
She ain't with that bullshit, my baby girl, she bold
Say a prayer for you, give you long kisses goodnight, then fill you with some holes
Riding in the Rolls, cruising in the third lane
This my first time around, I'm doing it for Byrd Gang
We them niggas hitting them switches, we cook the drugs in the kitchens
We getting ritches, I got love for my bitches
Got Black girls, Puerto Rican, even got 'em Chinese
Ecuadorian, white, even got 'em Guyanese
Y'all know how to find me, Lenox Ave, 7th Ave
Say what's up to my mother, I never had a better dad
Say what's up to my brother and love to the women
That's holding my nigga down while he sitting in prison
You don't know how a nigga living (You don't know)
Let's not talk about the past, let's just forget it (Let's just forget it, baby)
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I want you ('Cause I want you, want you, baby)
I gotta have you (Gotta have that thing)
And I need you (And I need you, need you, baby)
It's just like I got a habit
I want you (I want you, I got that fix)
I gotta have you (Need that thing, baby)
And I need you (And I need you, uh)
It's just like I got a habit

[Bridge]
The closer I get (Mafia)
The better you make me
The closer I get
The better you make me
The closer I get (Don't be like that, baby)
The better you make me
The closer I get
The better you make me feel

[Verse 3]
She telling me money don't make the man, you ain't gotta pretend to me
Before you was my lover, first, baby, you was a friend to me (Yeah)
I'm the kid, bitch, imagine my worth
Been clubbing, fucking bitches, all of that shit is work
Had to get up on them titties, started grabbing the shirt
I'ma lay you down, put you on your back, and then work
Make her wet it up, put it in, tap 'til it squirt
I be popping more bottles than the package at work
All my bitches, throw your hands in the sky
Let's get it poppin', get high
And for your nigga, just be ready to ride
I hit the road, kiss my baby goodbye
That's when she hit me with that look in her eye
She said
[Chorus]
'Cause I want you ('Cause I want you, want you, baby)
I gotta have you (Gotta have that thing)
And I need you (And I need you, need you, baby)
It's just like I got a habit
I want you (I want you, I got that fix)
I gotta have you (Need that thing, baby)
And I need you (And I need you, uh)
It's just like I got a habit

[Outro]
