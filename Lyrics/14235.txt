Donâ€™t Watch Me Dancing LyricsMargarida has a strange appeal
Sways between suitors on a broken heel
Of course, her desires they always mistook
She'd rather been scarred than be scarred with love

In conversation she often contend
Costumes built customs that involve dead ends
She found her courage in a change of scene
This Sunday-social would be short its queen

All her best years spent distracted
By these tired reenactments
With the right steps
She will try her chances
Somewhere else
There he is, a step outside her view
Reciting the words he hoped she might pursue
Night upon night a faithful light at shore
If he'd only convince his legs across the floor

Please don't watch me dancing
Oh no
Don't watch me dancing

Something changes when she glances
Enough to teach you what romance is
With the right steps they could try their chances
Somewhere else


Please don't watch me dancing
Don't watch me dancing
Please don't watch me dancing
Don't watch me dancing
