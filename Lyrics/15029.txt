Mojo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Those haunting rhymes are keeping the time
But they'll never get through to me
It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it
My party, there's no one but me in the corner
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?
[Chorus]
Now roll it up and smoke it again
Now line me up and snort it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again
[Verse 2]
Keep haunting me, taunting me
But they'll never get through to me
It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it
My party, there's blood on the ceiling, the carpet
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

[Chorus]
Now roll it up and smoke it again
It's bottoms up and drink it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again

[Verse 3]
I'm readin' the signs, makes me wonder
Why they're getting through to me?
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?
Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I?

[Chorus]
Now roll it up and smoke it again
It's bottoms up and drink it again
Now fix it up and shoot it again
I can't believe I did it again

[Outro]
Oops, I did it againYou might also like3Embed
