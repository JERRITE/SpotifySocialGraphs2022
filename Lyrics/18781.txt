House of Doom LyricsTake all that you can
Take it all
I know you'll do it again
Rape, rape me again
I'll take the fall
I know you'll do it again

Oh, I know the truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
No one gets out alive
Oh, won't you step inside
No one gets out alive
You lie and you lie again
You've got your plans
And you sure ain't no friend
Oh, there ain't no turning back
They say you reap what you sow
Hell, if that ain't a fact

Oh, I know the truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
No one gets out alive
Oh, won't you step inside
No one gets out alive

Oh, I know the truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
No one gets out alive
Oh, won't you step inside
No one gets out aliveYou might also likeEmbed
