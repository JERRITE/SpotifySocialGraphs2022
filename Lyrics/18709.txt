Iâ€™m Broken Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
While loved ones mourn the day
The absence of our faces
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at me now
[Chorus 1]
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken

[Verse 2]
One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood
Too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
Venereal mother embrace the loss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at you now

[Chorus 2]
You're broken
Inherit your life
You're broken

[Pre-Chorus 3]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at us now

[Chorus 1]
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at me now

[Outro]
I'm broken, broken
I'm broken, broken
I'm broken, broken
I'm broke5Embed
