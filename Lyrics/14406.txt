The Epidemiologist LyricsThe best laid plans can oft go to fockery
Run down B&Bs can turn into luxury
A wish that is wasted still can be granted
Hope that is doped still can be planted
I search and I search
I lurch headlong into atrocities
With an exponential known only to epidemiologists

Little pink Kenzo's little blue benzos
Hip Hop, Be-Bop, old blues and punk rocker
Heads that are shrunken still can be clever
Ships that are sunken still can hold treasure
I search and I search
I lurch headlong into atrocities
With a velocity known only to a very fеw astronauts
Few are, few arе very few astronauts
I search and I search
I lurch headlong into such atrocities
With an exponential known only to epidemiology
Dashiell Hammett
Émile Ajar
Peter Lorre and Humphrey Bogart

Panic in the streets and panic in Needle park
Oh yes I search and I search
And I lurch, I lurch headlong into atrocity
With an exponential known only to very few
Epidemiologists
