Crown Royal Lyrics[Verse]
Your hands on my hips pull me right back to you
I catch that thrust, give it right back to you
You're in so deep, I'm breathing for you
You grab my braids, arch my back high for you
Your diesel engine, I'm squirting mad oil on
Down on the floor till my speaker starts to boil
I flip shit, quick slip, hip dip, and I'm twisted
In your hands and your lips and your tongue tricks
And you're so thick, and you're so thick
And you're so...
[Chorus]
Crown Royal on ice
Crown Royal on ice (On Ice)
Crown Royal on ice
Crown Royal on ice (On Ice)

[Verse]
Your hands on my hips pull me right back to you
I catch that thrust, give it right back to you
You're in so deep, I'm breathing for you
You grab my braids, arch my back high for you
Your diesel engine, I'm squirting mad oil on
Down on the floor till my speaker starts to boil
I flip shit, quick slip, hip dip, and I'm twisted
In your hands and your lips and your tongue tricks
And you're so thick, and you're so thick
And you're so...

[Chorus]
Crown Royal on ice (Oh...)
Crown Royal on ice (Oh...)
Crown Royal on ice (Oh...)
Crown Royal on ice (Mmm...got you on ice, baby)You might also like2Embed
