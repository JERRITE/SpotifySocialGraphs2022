Used To You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah
It really doesn't make sense, we just met, you tested my heart
Know that you could be the one to heal or tear it apart
I don't know who you are, honestly I see you setting the bar
Smart girl and me a wannabe star
And I've been questioning love and if I'll ever connect
Wait for your text to never come, it's onto the next
What should I expect? You deserve a ring and a cheque
I'm a broke fucking rapper who complains 'bout his ex
And with that ass and with that rack, girl, you know that they want it
You really never had to work 'cause it's easy to flaunt it
You got a finger in the middle and I'm wrapped up on it
You're wanting more than blackin' out and wakin' up in your vomit
And if I (if I), if I had the chance to show you
Show you how it feels with someone who wants to get to know you
Show you how it feels when you forget about the old you
Show you that you're worth it, something no one's ever told you
Girl, you're worth that shit
Yo, all your girls are in the club yellin', "Twerk that shit"
You're in the back seat yellin', "Pass the purp back quick"
See, you would never choose me over your purse bag, shit
So every night is the same
A little black dress and make-up just to cover the pain
A girl in a world of people never using their brain
Every night you're asking why you went and did it again
And again nothing to gain in a room full of empty
Fake love, some drugs and a bottle that's empty
And that's around the time that you met me
A body to tempt me, I probably shouldn't touch, but you let me
You'll probably forget me 'cause to you I'm just one more pawn
What is love when the time is wrong?
You wanna do it, left the hall lights on
In your palm was a young icon, now you're gone, but
[Hook]
I could get used to you, I could probably get used to you
I could get used to you, used to you, used to you, yeah
We could waste all our time
Anything to keep you off my mind
If I lose myself tonight, myself tonight with you

[Verse 2]
I know you're feeling like no one will ever relate
You had a best friend, your best friend turned fake
You're used to having nothing more to spend in your bank
No gas in the tank, you think about your ex when you drink
See we know I don't know your story, so I'm never to judge
I know that you got feelings you swept under the rug
Your dad loved to drink, you think it runs in your blood
Your mom and dad couldn't make it, so you gave up on love
Never seen what it was, never had nobody to ask
So you gave it to any guy who was there chasing that ass
The facts are the facts, I've been never one to look back
But everything I see in you is everything that I lack
I lack knowing what you mean when you say, "Livin' it up"
I lack knowing if there ever could have ever been us
I lack dealing with my pain, I'm using you as a crutch
Like why the fuck I'd write a song about a one-night crush
A temporary connection, perfect is only perception
Could be a curse or a blessing, I guess I'm learning my lesson
I guess I'm tryin' to find some love inside a one-night session
Numb the pain with affection, but see you're turning me on
You left the hall lights on
In your palm was a young icon, now you're gone, but
You might also like[Hook]
I could get used to you, I could probably get used to you
I could get used to you, used to you, used to you, yeah
We could waste all our time
Anything to keep you off my mind
If I lose myself tonight, myself tonight with you

[Verse 3]
You see I seem to always do this, I focus on you
A pretty girl that I met out around a quarter to two
I got this hole in my chest, I try to fill it with you
I'm spillin' the truth, I just wanna forget for a few
And if you would really listen, this is more than a lyric
I'm hopin' you hear it, I open my spirit and let you in
I'm battlin' sin, wonder if I ever will win
To you I'm just another guy referrin' to me as him and him
Him and him like we're one and the same
But I promise you, not one of you is sharing my brain
And I know if you could feel a thing, you're feeling my pain
Almost rapping for four minutes, what the fuck am I sayin'?
This whole song is a bluff
Paint a picture of a girl from a bar like a slut
Like she drank too much, like she let me touch
But you don't hear me talk about me, man, that shit's too tough
We're at the same bar, the same club, looking for some fake love
Focused on attention, attention is just a fake drug
I focus on a girl, so I don't focus on my pay stub
I focus on the fact that my sis almost didn't wake up
We make up a generation and chasin' nothin' is vapor
Her picture up on your phone, you're like: "Homie how would you rate her?"
Her data is what you favor, decidin' if you would date her
I'm sick of being a waiter while destined for something greater
That's real
[Hook x2]
I could get used to you, I could probably get used to you
I could get used to you, used to you, used to you, yeah
We could waste all our time
Anything to keep you off my mind
If I lose myself tonight, myself tonight with you21Embed
