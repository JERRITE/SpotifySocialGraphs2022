This and That LyricsI really don’t understand how
You got me questionin my purpose
I coulda made u a man
But maybe you didn’t deserve it
You jus gon scroll thru the gram
Instead of cherishin our moments
You jus can’t do what I ask
And you dont even last
When you know that I want it
But you know that
And you just hold back
Why you be on that
You say you love me
Then you just fall back
What you call that
A silly ass nigga
Goofy ass nigga
Boy you all that
Love and loyalty
Consistency. I need all that
So If you can't pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby just be done wit me
If you won’t pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby just be done wit me
Cuz I gotta put you on standby
I ain’t tryna tell you again bebe
You needa act right
I don’t need opinions
I don’t need you’re advice
Worried bout who up in my dm’s
When I don’t even read them cuz
I’m wit you
But you know that
You just hold back
You say you love me
But you just hurt me
Then you fall back
Silly ass nigga
Goofy ass nigga
Boy you all that
Love and loyalty
Consistency. I need all that
So If you can't pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby just be done wit me
If you won’t pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby jus be done wit me
I Need someone loyal
Can’t keep waiting for ya

I Need someone loyal
And if you ain’t let me go

So If you can't pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby just be done wit me
If you won’t pop a gun for me
Then maybe you’re not the one for me
If you’re more focused on
What that girl doin or
This girl and that girl
Then baby jus be done wit meYou might also likeEmbed
