TranslationsMØ - Blur (Remix) ft. Foster The People (Traducción al Español)Blur (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: MØ]
Under the bad, bad moon tonight
Or baby is it just me?
Or is it something in the air we breathe?
'Cause I'm feeling dizzy, dizzy, ah
How was the party? Was it treating you right?
I wish that I could be there but I'm
Under the bad, bad moon tonight
Baby, can you help me?

[Chorus: MØ]
Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Too much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad signs
I wanna tell you everything will be fine
But I’m afraid that it's a waste of your time
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur
[Post-Chorus]
Hey!
Oh
Oh
Hey!
Oh

[Verse 2: Mark Foster]
I've had these weird thoughts for a while
Can't shake 'em when I'm so low
They're combative and post-traumatic
All I know is when I'm stressin' out I smoke more
I hit my friend up on the phone
The only calm inside a war zone
Under the bad, bad moon tonight
I just need to come clean

[Chorus: MØ & Mark Foster]
Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Too much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad signs
I wanna tell you everything will be fine
But I’m afraid that it's a waste of your time
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur

Hey!
Woo!
Hey!
Trapped in a blur
Hey!
Trapped in a blur
Oh
Oh
Hey!
Oh
Woah

[Outro: MØ]
Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur2Embed
