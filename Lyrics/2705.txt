Perfect Melody Lyrics[Intro: Julian Perretta]
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum

[Verse 1: Julian Perretta]
Still don't know why I did that to you
I know now that I did you wrong
You were something I wasn't used to
All I did, I did because
[Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody

[Post-Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum

[Verse 2: Julian Perretta]
I don't know how you do this to me (Oh yeah)
All I know that it's all my fault, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (Oh yeah)
I don't know who the hell I've been fooling
Without you, I only fall apart
You might also like[Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody

[Post-Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum

[Bridge: Julian Perretta]
I'm falling to pieces without you
I'm caught in my feelings about you
Falling to pieces without you
Over and over again
[Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Every time I close my eyes
You were right there with me
It's like I can taste the wine
Feel the sand on my feet
Take me back to paradise
Play our own symphony
We were tripping through the night
With that perfect melody

[Post-Chorus: Julian Perretta]
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum
Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum, da
Ratata, ratata
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pum

[Outro: Julian Perretta]
Papa, papa, pa, pa-rum
Papa, pa, rum, pum-pumEmbed
