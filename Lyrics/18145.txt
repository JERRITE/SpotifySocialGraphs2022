Pink Ferrari Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I'm tired everyday
It's always take shots, go to the same spots on replay
Yeah, I need a fire, do you feel the same?
No one would chase us, they can replace us
What do you say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's early and we're just two kids
But let me tell you somethin' 'bout the life we'll live
It'll go like this
[Chorus]
We'll get the black-tinted windows on a pink Ferrari
Drive real fast past paparazzi
'Cause we won't need LA anymore, anymore
We'll feel so loved, we won't need no parties
I'll be Clyde and you'll be Bonnie
And we'll just run away for more, for more

[Verse 2]
We'll leave in a hurry, just pack a few things
Yeah, we'll quit our day jobs and we can just get lost and leave everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's early and we're just two kids
But let me tell you somethin' 'bout the life we'll live
It'll go like this (One, two, one, two, three, yeah)

[Chorus]
We'll get the black-tinted windows on a pink Ferrari
Drive real fast past paparazzi
'Cause we won't need LA anymore, anymore
We'll feel so loved, we won't need no parties
I'll be Clyde and you'll be Bonnie
And we'll just run away for more, for more

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Yeah)

We'll feel so loved, we won't need no parties
I'll be Clyde and you'll be Bonnie
And we'll just run away for more, for more2Embed
