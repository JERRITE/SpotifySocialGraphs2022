Water On The Moon Lyrics(Chorus)
Water on the moon yeah
I found you
Hope to see you soon yeah
Let it let it
Let it let it

Spendin’ time lookin’ feelin’ so free and feeling alright feeling alright
Gotta divide up my mind between what I think is quite enough getting quitter as we reach the top
Fast to keep what’s ours goddamn calls lookin’ right catchin’ and all my flights lifted
I’m tight like jeans they fitted its getting hard to work the farm
I mean no harm
I come in peace
The generation
The sign it come peace up eat up speak up if you got something to say its your day to shine. Getting lined sitting by the fire rip down the flier take hits to get higher
Yeah
We go hard just to start it off right. Send the water we got it all night
We go hard just to start it off right. (I’m on fire and I'm alright)
Send the water we got it all night (I’m on fire and I'm alright)
Yeah
(Chorus)
Water on the moon yeah
I found you
Hope to see you soon yeah
Let it let it
Let it let it

Ever since I left that sickness behind I knew I’d find something that would make it just right
Long days warm nights. Up in my home I’m left checking obsessive over my phone
There’s something else I’ve found
Just sort it out with time
