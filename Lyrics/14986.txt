Bandoliers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, it's too late
I got hit by the closing door
And as I watch myself reflect
On the wrong side of...

[Verse 2]
My, you've changed
You turned a corner I'll never go
I admit I feel a bit deceived
You're expecting I'd follow
[Pre-Chorus]
Bandoliers
To fight me dear
Nobody caused the rift
We've just grown apart now

[Chorus]
So prepare and take aim and then fire
Prepare and take aim and then fire on me
If that's the way it has to be

[Verse 3]
I'm fooling myself
Fooling myself into believing you
And all these fictionary tales
You're telling yourself

[Verse 4]
Selfish
Like a child that's never heard a 'no'
I watched him ever changing you
Never find us

[Pre-Chorus]
Bandoliers
To fight you dear
Nobody caused the rift
Can't become what I'm not
You've always had my heart
So if it must be broken
You might also like[Chorus]
So prepare and take aim and then fire
Prepare and take aim and then fire
Prepare and take aim and then fire
Prepare and take aim and then fi...
Prepare and take aim and then fire

[Instrumental Solo]

[Interlude]
Fire away

[Verse 5]
If you must but I only came
Just to let you know
This is goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, oh-oh-oh
Goodbye, oh-oh-oh
Goodbye, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Prepare and take aim and then fire
Prepare and take aim and then fire
'Cause no one can make me die
No one can make, make me die4Embed
