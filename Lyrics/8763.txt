You Ainâ€™t Seen Nothing Yet - Single Version LyricsI met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any love is good lovin' and
So I took what I could get mmh
Oooh, oooh, she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure

He said that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with big brown eyes and said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something that you never gonna forget
You know, you know, you know you just ain't seen nothin' yet

Any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then she looked at me with those big brown eyes and said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something, here's something that you never gonna forget
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet

You ain't been around!
You ain't seen nothing yet
That's what she told me
She said I need to go to school
You might also likeI know I ain't seen nothing yet
I know I ain't seen nothing yet
Ooohooo, ooohooo, ooohooohooo
Ain't that something going around then?

Better be good
But I ain't seen nothing yetEmbed
