Swimming Pool Summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
I break a sweat at the ch√¢teau
A party crowd that I don't know
"La dolce vita" head to toe
I kiss a cheek to say hello
She takes a sip of champagne
It's elegant, but not vain
She calls attention to her vein
And then she dives into my brain

[Chorus]
Swimming pool summer
Gimme your number
Under your cover
I wanna take the heat
[Verse 2]
She comes up for a breath
Fuck the rest, she's the best
Her eyes are laser-beaming me
Suspending all reality
And just as soon as she smiles
She puts her sunglasses on
I haven't felt this in a while
She breaks me down in style

[Chorus]
Swimming pool summer
Gimme your number
Under your cover
I wanna take the heat

[Post-Chorus]
Physical wonder
A sensual hunter
Under your cover
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat

[Chorus]
Swimming pool summer
Gimme your number
Under your cover
I wanna take the heat
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Physical wonder
A sensual hunter
Under your cover
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat
I can't escape the heat1Embed
