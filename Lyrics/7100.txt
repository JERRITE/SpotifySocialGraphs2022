Kinda Love (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: D Smoke]
My lil tea cup'
We gon' have to negotiate them expectations love

[Verse 1: TeaMarrr]
You're the plug, you're the charge
You're the blunt, you're the smoke
You're the one that I want, that I need
Like the song
I get lost in my thoughts
Damn I lost all my thoughts
Like I told 'em get lost
Fuck up off of my heart
[Chorus: TeaMarrr]
I don't really need that can't sleep kinda love
Can't eat please save me kinda love
Don't want that
Ooooooo
But I want you

I want that won't creep, won't sneak kinda love
That so deep, I'm freak kinda love
That ooooo
Yeah I want you

[Post Chorus: TeaMarrr]
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good, one good, one good reason
Not to fuck it up like that ohhhhh
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't wanna fuck this up like that

[Verse 2: TeaMarrr]
You're the boom to the bang
When my my front side get close
When we bang when we boom
What's the punchline for fuck
I give up, you're the boss
Not the boss of my heart
Get caught up with a thot
This is not what you want
You might also like[Chorus: TeaMarrr]
I don't really need that can't sleep kinda love
Can't eat please save me kinda love
Don't want that
Ooooooo
But I want you

I want that won't creep, won't sneak kinda love
That so deep, I'm freak kinda love
That ooooo
Yeah I want you

[Verse 3: D Smoke]
Now here we are
Here we are
You wanna build a nigga robot
But will he talk, will he call?
You want him Anthony Davis tall
Look in the pantry, get the ingredients
Bake a loyal nigga never mischievious
Take some foil better cover em well
Hater bitches gon' be giving you hell

Not to mention if you want him intelligent
He gon' think that petty shit is irrelevant (Mhmm, Mhmm)
You want him to listen when you're venting
And you just be all up in your feelings
But if he too sensitive that ain't attractive huh
You want him to empathize but be killin that shit in the mattress huh
Now I ain't sayin lower your expectations
I'm just sayin expect problems when you expect greatness
As long as he give you good love
And show you respect daily
Then your big bro Smoke won't have to go loco and break necks
If it's just dick use a latex

[Post Chorus: TeaMarrr]
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good reason not to fuck with you like that
Can you give me one good, one good, one good reason
Not to fuck it up like that ohhhhh
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't wanna fuck this up like thatEmbed
