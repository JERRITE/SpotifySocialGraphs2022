My First Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Avant]
Silhouette of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile will always remain (Will always remain)
Beginners' love soon fades away
Oh, baby, we go on, I will always

[Chorus: Keke Wyatt & Avant]
(Long as I live) Long as I live
You will be (My first love)
Oh, baby, you and only
(Long as I live) Long as I live
You will be (My first love)
And I'll choose you again
[Verse 2: Keke Wyatt]
I'll keep an old candy-coated valentine
Memories of you-you when you were mine
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain
Times keep changin', come sun or rain

[Chorus: Keke Wyatt & Avant]
(Long as I live) Long as I live
You will be (My first love)
My first love and my only love
(Long as I live) Long as I live
(My first love) You will always be my, oh, be my first love
See, as long as I live, long as I live
I like it, baby
Sing to me
(My first love)
You will always be my first love
You'll be my
And I'll choose you again

[Bridge: Avant & KeKe Wyatt]
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain, oooh, ooh
Times keep changin', come sun or rain
You might also like[Chorus: Keke Wyatt & Avant]
(Long as I live) Long as I live, baby, yes
You will be (My first love)
I will always love you, baby
My first love
(Long as I live) For the rest of my life, you will always be
My first love
Only, oh, yeah, yeah
Ohhh, oh, KeKe
(Long as I live)
Oh, yes (My first love)11Embed
