Tropic Love Lyrics[Verse: Contacreast]
I remember the ocean
Memories die out so hard
We were travelling mountains on mounts
Just to find the loudest seas
[Pre-Chorus: Contacreast]
We settled down by the fire
Knowing we could aim higher
But we didn’t know that yet
So if you want something to hold on to
Gotta find it first
But here I am
[Chorus: Contacreast]
‘Cause I’ve been laying under palm trees
Waiting for the summer
Knowing there’s nowhere to go
‘Cause I am happy on this island
Wanna be my funland?
I don’t ever want to leave
I’m in a tropic love
[Verse: Contacreast]
I remember the ocean
Memories die out so hard
We were travelling mountains on mounts
Just to find the loudest seas
[Pre-Chorus: Contacreast]
We settled down by the fire
Knowing we could aim higher
But we didn’t know that yet
So if you want something to hold on to
Gotta find it first
But here I am
[Chorus: Contacreast]
‘Cause I’ve been laying under palm trees
Waiting for the summer
Knowing there’s nowhere to go
‘Cause I am happy on this island
Wanna be my funland?
I don’t ever want to leave
I’m in a tropic loveYou might also like3Embed
