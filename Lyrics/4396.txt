Blackest In The Room Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
You know what, Al?
Y-you know what I'm sayin'? Whatâ€”
What a nigga do if I went so, so, so cold with this shit? You dig? (So cold)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Where would you go? What would you do? Who would you screw?
Black Forces, so his brain ain't leave a stain on my shoe
Uh, this GOAT talk, bet they put my face on that mountain too (Yeah)
Blackest in the room like I'm Sam Cooke at the Fontainebleau (Yeah, yeah)
Blackest in the room like I'm Sam Cooke at the Copa (Yeah)
East Gary niggas, we stick together like dope and soda
Put that shit on Nation, my cliquelation on Costra Nostra
If I smoked him on this side, will I see him when I cross over? Damn
Gotta spit it 'cause it sit on my heart
The shit I think when I look up at the stars
I went to jail, the warden put me in the hole 'cause I wouldn't rap for the guards
I had bars back when Lambo burned my demo on a CDR
This GOAT talk, nigga, TB12
From the streets to the cell, bitch, I bail, all well (All well)
Got the AK with the catcher, we ain't leavin' no shells
Plus I'm surgical with this bitch like Training Day Denzel, yeah
Blackest in the room, Fred Hampton, they came and shot it up
Blackest in the room, Jeff Fort when he hit Gaddafi up
Blackest in the room, why can't niggas hit Clarence Thomas up?
My cousin live in Flint, she been sick since they fucked the water up
[Part II]

[Verse 2]
I start the drama up (You forgot)
Black suits and black curses, limo service pick your mama up (Pick your mama up, bitch)
Checked out on that ambulance, too late to hit the doctor up (Yeah)
Cut off all my bitches from last year, I cleaned my roster up (Cut that bitch)
A nigga did a rebuild, tons on the scizale
Shows, I need a hundred fifty thousand like I'm Ezal (I need a hundred fifty thou')
Sent in on the truck, the pack too big to do the mizail
Tried to kick that cup, but fucked around and I got a refill
Fuck around, we gon' find out
Fuck around, get found slumped
Silly bitches, they be worried 'bout a nigga body count 'stead of countin' up
Forgiato with the floatin' caps on the new 'Lac, got it mounted up
Baby tried to throw that ass out, but I was passed out and she was out of luck
Yeah, you out of luck, bitch
Nervous 'cause detectives is lurkin', they pick the workers up (Yeah)
Jump it off like Bizzy and Juicy, I fuck these verses up
Kane Train kick-door, shorty, you just a burglar (Yeah)
My pistol in my pillow, I sleep amongst all the murderers
Nervous 'cause detectives is lurkin', they pick the workers up (Yeah)
Jump it off like Bizzy and Juicy, I fuck these verses up (Kane Train, bitch)
Niggas don't give no fuck, if you die, they might shoot your service up (Baow)
My pistol in my pillow, I sleep amongst all the murderers, nigga, yeah
