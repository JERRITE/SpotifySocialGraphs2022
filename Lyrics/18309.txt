My 9ine Lyrics[Intro]
She'll buss my nine
Ya ya ya yaaa oh
She'll buss my nine
Ay eh Kojo 'n' Baba

[Verse 1]
There's somebody, she is a cutie
Very special, she holds all my bullets
Take good care of me, when I am shooting
But tonight I'm riding and she keeps me safe
When I think I'm all alone
She's always by my side
You can come my side
I think I'm all over you by my side
You can come my side
Why these niggas looking for trouble
They don't want it with me, 'ah ya ya
Acting like they on it, when they see me
They be running away, 'ah ya yay eh
[Hook]
I'm ready to ride she's outside
Them niggas can't come to my side
When she with me, I know that I'm fine 'cause
I know she right by my side
'Cause if I ride for you, ride for you
You'll be fine
I'll buss my nine for you
I will do all this time-iiime

[Verse 2]
It's on sight, catch a nigga slipping with the .45
We can beef, bring your boys outside
One hook could send a nigga night, night
Bye bye, hmm right, right
A nigga on me it's all lies, lies
Me and my niggas don't really fight, fight
We got shells ready to fly, fly
Oh my, my I made him cry, cry
You don't want war, you know it's on me
I see you ducking and diving, you phony
The 16th my niggas, my hitters my homies
We don't squash beef, my nigga don't phone me
Everyday I got the bloody ting upon me
If I got my bag, you know I'm not lonely
All my niggas tell me that she really dirty
I never bare back, I got my gloves on me
You might also like[Hook]
I'll be ready to ride she's outside
Them niggas can't come to my side
When she with me, I know that I'm fine 'cause
I know she right by my side
'Cause if I ride for you, ride for you
You'll be fine
I'll buss my nine for you
I will do all this time-iiime

[Bridge]
If they come, I can't forget you
You got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't here what can I do?
No one, can put their hands on you
You got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't here what can I do?

[Outro]
No one, ah nigga can hold one
Mami can hold one
Can you give a little..
Whole one, slow one
Whole one, nigga can hold one
If you wanna hold one
Yeaaa, Jheeze!
Why you laughing for?
What, you feel that?2Embed
