​take my own advice Lyrics[Verse 1]
We both need some time to ourselves
The things that you bought me sit on the shelf
I don't need to go find somebody else
I just need to try and find myself

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know who I am anymore
Too many times I opened the door
Let people in who don't know me at all
Need to take my own advice, keep my circle small
I'm closed off
I hit a road block, oooh
Closed off
Closed off
[Verse 2]
I throw myself right into the void
I don't need love, swear I'll be alright
Buried trust in the ground, yeah, and wait till it dies
Stare in the mirror, jump in anytime

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know who I am anymorе
Too many times I opened thе door
Let people in who don't know me at all
Need to take my own advice, keep my circle small
I'm closed off
I hit a road block, oooh
Closed off
