When Love Takes Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's complicated
It always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows

[Pre-Chorus]
Head underwater
Now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could
[Chorus]
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight

[Verse 2]
Give me a reason
I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload?
And this time, I blame you, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all

[Chorus]
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something’s here tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, I-I, I'll be loving you all the time, it's true
'Cause I-I, I'll wanna make it right, with you

When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
Over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over

[Outro]
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something’s here tonight3Embed
