Stay My Baby Lyrics[Intro]
Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Oh, oh, oh (Uh-huh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Stay my baby

[Verse 1]
Summer love isn't meant to be
And it's only a fantasy
That's what everyone's telling me
Stay my baby (Stay my baby)
Even know it's a little rushed
Let me know that you'll keep in touch
If you don't, it'll hurt too much
Stay my baby (Stay my baby)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Tell me right now
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How it's going down
[Chorus]
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (Stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So, now 'til forever, stay my baby (stay my baby)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now that I've gone back to school
All I do is think of you
Sitting up here in my room
Going crazy
But then you call
Gets me through it all
Every time I hear you say
Stay my baby

[Chorus]
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (Stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So, now 'til forever, stay my baby (Stay my baby)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, tell me right now
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how it's going down

[Chorus]
Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
I know that it'll go my way
If you stay my baby (Stay my baby)
I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna have enough
So now 'til forever, stay my baby

[Outro]
Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby
Stay my baby (Stay my baby)
