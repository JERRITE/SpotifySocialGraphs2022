Inertiatic ESP Lyrics[Chorus]
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

[Verse 1]
Last night I heard lepers
Flinch like birth defects
Its musk was fecal in origin
As the words dribbled off of its chin (Chin)
It said "I'm lost, I'm lost"
[Chorus]
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

[Verse 2]
Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils
Cast in oblong arms length
The hooks have been picking their scabs
Where wolves hide in the company of men
It said "I'm lost, I'm lost"

[Chorus]
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

[Bridge]
Are you peaking in the red?
Perforated at the neck
What of this mongrel architect?
A broken arm of sewers set
Past, present, and future tense
Clipside of the pink-eyed fountain
What of this mongrel architect?
A broken arm of sewers set
Past, present, and future tense
Clipside of the pink-eyed fountain

Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

[Outro]
It's been said, long time ago
You'll be the first and last to know
Ah, you'll never know
Ah, you'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know11Embed
