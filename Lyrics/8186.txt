Better When Youâ€™re Gone Lyrics[Verse 1: Emma Lov Block]
I got pain from my waist up
And I wake up and I take drugs
And I say stuff that I make up, like "I hate love"
And I hate that I can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried
It'll suck for all week, then hurt more on the weekend
When I go out and see your friends
And I don't know what to tell 'em
I can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
I'm comin' around to see you, comin' around to leave you
What is the point of hoping when it's already broken?
It hurts to let you go and it's worse to hold on
But I know that I'll be better when you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone
[Post-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
When you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone

[Verse 2: Emma Lov Block]
You gave me just eighty
When I needed all hundred percent of you lately
It's obvious you don't even try, you don't even try

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
I'm comin' around to see you, comin' around to leave you
What is the point of hoping when it's already broken?
It hurts to let you go and it's worse to hold on
But I know that I'll be better when you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone

[Post-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
When you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're goneYou might also like5Embed
