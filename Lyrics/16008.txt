Over at the Frankenstein Place Lyrics[Verse 1: Janet]
In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright, there's a guiding star
No matter what, or who you are

[Chorus: Brad and Janet (Background Singers)]
There's a light
(Over at the Frankenstein place)
There's a light
(Burning in the fireplace)
There's a light, light
In the darkness of everybody's life
[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
The darkness must go
Down the river of night's dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life, into my life

[Chorus: Brad and Janet (Background Singers)]
There's a light
(Over at the Frankenstein place)
There's a light
(Burning in the fireplace)
(There's a light, a light)
In the darkness of everybody's lifeYou might also like1Embed
