Replay LyricsShawties like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out
Got me singing like na na na na every day
Like my iPod stuck on replay

[Verse 1]
Remember the first time we met you
It was at the mall with your friends
I was scared to approach you but then you came closer
Hoping you give me a chance

Who would ever knew
That we would end up being more than friends
But we were wild, breaking all the rules
She’s like a song played again and again
[Pre-Chorus]
That girl, like some of a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She’s running through my mind all day ay

[Chorus]
Shawties like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out
Got me singing like na na na na every day
Like my iPod stuck on replay

Shawties like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out
Got me singing like na na na na every day
Like my iPod stuck on replay

[Verse 2]
See you’ve been all around the globe
Now wanted to leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night to the morn
Girl, you really changed my life

Doing things I never do
I’m in the kitchen cooking things she likes
But we were wild, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna’ make you my wife
[Pre-Chorus]
That girl, like some of a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She’s running through my mind all day ay

[Chorus]
Shawties like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out
Got me singing like na na na na every day
Like my iPod stuck on replay

Shawties like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out
Got me singing like na na na na every day
Like my iPod stuck on replay

[Post-Chorus]
I could be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me hey

I could be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me hey
