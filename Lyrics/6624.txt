Dee-dum-dum-dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Aluna & Bekuh BOOM]
Love to do just what I want
Do it when you say I won't
Now come and watch me move it
I promise I'ma make you lose it

[Pre-Chorus: Wolftyla, Bekuh BOOM, Wolftyla & Bekuh BOOM]
Looking at me, nah, come get it (Uh-huh)
Like what you see, then you got good vision (Uh-huh)
Boy, this beat hit so different (Uh-huh)
Let me show you what you been missing
[Chorus: Bekuh BOOM & Wolftyla, Wolftyla]
If you love to party
Then the party's in the place
Got the boom, got the bass
I'ma shake it in your face
Yeah, I love to party
And I love to make it rain
Got the boom, got the bang
You can take that to the bank

[Post-Chorus: Bekuh BOOM]
Going dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Watch the drum go dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Dee-dum-dum-dum
Watch the drum go dum

[Refrain: Bekuh BOOM, Aluna]
I just wanna be free
Ain't no way you stopping me
Said I wanted to fly
So I went and got some wings
And I don't, don't need you
To act like you gon' hold me down
'Cause I won't believe you
No one can touch me now

Feeling like I run it
Checked my pulse, over one hundred
Got no peak, I got no summit
I'm not average, I don't sum it
That's from sun up and from sun down
Shining like the sun out
Think you mirror image
But you looking like a fun house

[Pre-Chorus: Wolftyla, Bekuh BOOM, Wolftyla & Bekuh BOOM]
Looking at me, nah, come get it (Uh-huh)
Like what you see, then you got good vision (Uh-huh)
Boy, this beat hit so different (Uh-huh)
Let me show you what you been missing

[Chorus: Aluna]
If you love to party
Then the party's in the place
Got the boom, got the bass
I'ma shake it in your face
Yeah, I love to party
And I love to make it rain
Got the boom, got the bang
You can take that to the bank
[Post-Chorus: Bekuh BOOM]
