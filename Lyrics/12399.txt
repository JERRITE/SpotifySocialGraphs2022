Violent Principles LyricsYou failed to look behind you
Too late to twist your lies
I was standing right beside you
Ready to fight until I die
Not about to waste my time
Stand outside the painted lines
I started feeling myself burning

Not gonna take this slow
Burn this city to the ground
Not gonna let this go
Let your ego tear you down
It's not consensual
Choke on whispers as you drown
So antisocial
With violent principles
Never question what's inside you
Never try to find out why
When I was standing right beside you
Lost in hate with sharpened knives
Not about to lose this fight
Dancing on my grave this timе
I started feeling myself falling

Not gonna take this slow
Burn this city to thе ground
Not gonna let this go
Let your ego tear you down
It's not consensual
Choke on whispers as you drown
So antisocial
With violent principles

We isolate
So it's easier to hate
Just can't relate
We need pills to sedate

Never gonna let me out of this fucked up life
Never gonna let me out of this fucked up life

Not gonna take this slow
Burn this city to the ground
Not gonna let this go
Let your ego tear you down
It's not consensual
Choke on whispers as you drown
So antisocial
With violent principles

Burn this city to the ground
Not gonna let this go (Not gonna let this go)
Let your ego tear you down
It's not consensual (It's not consensual)
Choke on whispers as you drown
So antisocial
With violent principlesEmbed
