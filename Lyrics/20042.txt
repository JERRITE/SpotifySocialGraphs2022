Forsaken Me Lyrics[Chorus: MSDOX]
Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?
Why are these boys always tryna be so fucking fake with me?
When I die, I got nothing that I wanna take with me
Bury me
Bury me
Pussy are you daring me?
Dancing with the devil
Got my demons there with me
No love in the air, I knew that you were never there for me
People make me sick, I don't care if you care for mе
Say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for mе
[Verse 1: Bill $aber]
I'm too forsaken
Ya'll pussies for Satan
All my bitches universal and my niggas come gun blazin
Cook this beat mignon filet
So what the fuck they sayin?
Keep they bitches in my spaceship
Saber playin on her station
You don't really know what it look like huh?
When a nigga like me come through so fresh so clean
On the scene, bitch I'm big like pun
All this weed, I gotta light some
All these hoes, I gotta pipe one
Fuck that, that's dead, I pass it to the bro
If they ahead me, then I pass em fa sho
My show, I need my cash, my dough

[Verse 2: MSDOX]
I won't give up my place at the round table
Take a sip of the holy grail and pass to the left
Like clockwork, I'm sick of counting these minutes down
My patient's patiently waiting for his final breath
When I talk I know you don't think that I sound stable
Pull a stick on a motherfucker and shoot through his chest
I have run through my trials and all my tribulations
It's up to God if he thinks I passed the test

Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?
Why are these boys always tryna be so fucking fake with me?
When I die, I got nothing that I wanna take with me
Bury me
Bury me
Pussy are you daring me?
Dancing with the devil
Got my demons there with me
No love in the air, I knew that you were never there for me
People make me sick, I don't care if you care for me
Say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me

Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?
Why these boys always tryna be so damn fucking fake with me?
When I die, I got nothing that I wanna take with me
Bury me
Bury me
Pussy are you daring me?
Dancing with the devil
Got my demons there with me
No love in the air, I knew that you were never there for me
People make me sick, I don't care if you care for me
Say it with me
Descend into madness
Say a prayer for me
[Verse 3: Bill $aber]
I need that bag cause I can't wait no mo
So little nigga, show that money what you waitin fo
I mix that henny with the trauma tryna stay afloat
But it's not workin I'm still hangin from that fishing pole
For real

[Outro: MSDOX]

Tell me why these burdens in my life are set upon me
Swing!
My suffering is funny
I don't give a fuck if you hate me or you love me, yuhEmbed
