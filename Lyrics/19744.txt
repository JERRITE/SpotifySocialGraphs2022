Booty Dancer Lyrics[Intro]
Booty dancer
Booty dancer

[Chorus]
Ayy, bitch, keep dancin' (Keep dancin')
I was cute but the money made me handsome (Handsome)
Ayy, kidnap your bitch, no ransom (Ransom)
Ayy, take off your shoes, it's a mansion
Take it off, go, go
Booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, bitch, keep dancin'
[Verse 1]
Ayy, twenty bad bitches in a mansion (Mansion)
Got some bitches in the Uber, they just landed (Landed)
This my lifestyle, nigga, I ain't plan it (No)
Ain't a bitch on this planet that I can't get (None)
Money on my mind, I got the bandwith (Ha)
They gon' show respect 'cause I demand it (I demand it)
She don't speak English, only Spanish
Si, sex language, I got advantage
Poppin' that ass, bussin' out the bag (Buss it)
Tryna fuck with her, better have cash
All the bitches in my section, niggas get mad
Thought we ran out, I got more in the stash (Stash)

[Chorus]
Ayy, bitch, keep dancin' (Keep dancin')
I was cute but the money made me handsome (Handsome)
Ayy, kidnap your bitch, no ransom (Ransom)
Ayy, take off your shoes, it's a mansion
Take it off, go, go
Booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, booty dancin'
Bounce that ass, go, bitch, keep dancin'

[Verse 2]
Uh, freak or romantic, pussy don't panic
Fuck with your skirt on, slide off the panties (Slide, slide)
Put in work and my two comin' handy (Bah)
Macho Man, I'm a savage like Randy (Savage)
On the bed, baby (Bed baby)
Give me head, baby (Head, baby)
Spread your legs, baby (Legs, baby)
And you goin' crazy
Need a young bitch, need a old lady
Ride for me like Chrisean do for Blueface, baby (Baby)
Haha, and I told her I put her on soon as I made it
(Told her I'd put her on when I made it)
But the bitch too impatient, that's why she never made it (Bitch)
