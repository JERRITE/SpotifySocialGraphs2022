Dior You Lyrics[Intro]
(Aidan Han beats)
(Oh, yeah, Berki, this the one right here)
Uh, uh

[Chorus]
Get her Saint Laurent sneakers or Dior shoes
I'll buy you anythin' you want 'cause I adore you
Let's fuck on the balcony, I'm trying to give you some more views
You ain't trippin' 'bout them bitches that's before you
Tell me your goals and I'll support you
Somethin' we could work to
Just show me you loyal, I'll reward you
She feeling alone, well, baby, I've been through that war too
She's scared of love and I'm afraid of that word too
[Verse]
Well, she been ashing blunts on her dressеr
Told me 'bout her first heartbrеak, might take months to forget him
She told me our love was forever
But lately I been feelin' unsure and only drugs made me better
She just want a thug, nothin' better, like, realest love ever
Write her four pages letters while clutchin' Berettas
I know I ain't got no time on my schedule
But if I feel like she ain't mine, I'ma let her go
Bad bitches only putting dimes on my pedestal
Savage, I give her the nine, she might let it blow
This heart is somethin' you won't find with a stethoscope
Sometimes I wish I could rewind just to let you know
Says she don't want a man 'cause they toxic
She say that I'm not shit and when she with her friends I'm the topic
I'm just tryin' to spoil her with bands while we shoppin'
Come down this road, hold my hands while we crossin'

[Chorus]
Get her Saint Laurent sneakers or Dior shoes
I'll buy you anythin' you want 'cause I adore you
Let's fuck on the balcony, I'm trying to give you some more views
You ain't trippin' 'bout them bitches that's before you
Tell me your goals and I'll support you
Somethin' we could work to
Just show me you loyal, I'll reward you
She feeling alone, well, baby, I've been through that war too
She's scared of love and I'm afraid of that word tooYou might also like5Embed
