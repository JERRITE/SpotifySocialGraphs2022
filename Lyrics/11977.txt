EYEZ ON EM Lyrics[Intro]
I gotta- I gotta one-take this shit, uh, aye, huh, uh
Aye, aye, uh, I don't need a- aye
G-lock, know I keep it, huh
Aye
G-lock, know I keep it, huh

[Chorus]
G-lock, know I keep it close
Keep me calm, 'case a nigga out here tryna do the most, aye
Fe-fi-foe'nem leave you toast
I can see it in his eyes, he gon fold up when it's smoke, hol' up, aye
Keep eyes on 'em cause I know
Niggas snakes in disguise, when it's up I'm on his ho
Keep eyes on 'em cause I know
He might die about his pride if I treat him like a ho
Hol' up, aye
Ayе, keep eyes on 'em, hе ain't cloaked, hol' up, aye
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, aye, huh, aye
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, aye, huh, aye
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low
[Verse]
Re-rock, niggas stole the flow, but it's calm
Cause a nigga got a bout a hunnid more, aye
Cheap highs, I don't know bout those
Sippin fast, I done prolly spent about a hunnid more
Rap game full of buncha hoes, no surprise
Give it time and we gon' see who really fold
Cheat codes, better play yo role, when it's mine
Imma pack these niggas up and send 'em home

[Chorus]
G-lock, know I keep it close
Keep me calm, 'case a nigga out here tryna do the most, aye
Fe-fi-foe'nem leave you toast
I can see it in his eyes, he gon fold up when it's smoke, hol' up, aye
Keep eyes on 'em cause I know
Niggas snakes in disguise, when it's up I'm on his ho
Keep eyes on 'em cause I know
He might die about his pride if I treat him like a ho
Hol' up, aye
Aye, keep eyes on 'em, he ain't cloaked, hol' up, aye
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, aye, huh, aye
