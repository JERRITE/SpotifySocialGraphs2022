Free 1031 LyricsNow you niggas done got me all started (x2)
Fuck a perky, you know I'm retarded
Free my brothers that locked for them charges
I can't love on you babe cuz I'm heartless
Since a youngin' I'm destined to get it
Use your head fore' we knock off your fitted
In this circle you know that we winnin'
Used to stop now his bands on the dinner
Brodie all in the cut like a demon
He be itchin' to clutch it and squeeze it
God I thank you for all of my shooters
Cuz they wid' it just give em a reason
All my life I been livin' improper
It was good to bе robbin and theifin'
It felt good to send him to thе doctor
He was talking on bro so you meet him
Anywhere in my city on 50
And get litty like bro do you get me?
But I know that my brother he got me
Anybody move funny its litty
But you know I can't love on no Cardi
I'm just tryna' come nut on her titties
Lil mommy yeah she the body
I'm just tryna put dick in her kidneys
Big knockers, I get wonky
You don't wanna come get outta pocket
I don't care for a song but flock it
Big EBK niggas know how I'm rockin'
Bro pop it, start droppin
You get sent to the stars with this rocket
And this 80 I got named hottie
Yeah this shit small but the clip like a noggin
If you want it then boy you can get it
Ain't no stoppin' we start til we finished
Tryna run you get shot while you dippin
Brodie be buggin, he be clickin' and clickin'
He a menace, yeah he wid it
He ain't into the rap cuz he live it
Once he back got the choppers guerillas
They used to look down now a nigga is shittin
All my shooters be out til the sun up
We been scorin like fuck is a one up?
No matter the weather, get hot like the summer
Bullets rain he get clapped with the thunder
Keep a stick like your boy was a drummer
Keep thinkin' its funny, the joke will your mother
She crying cuz niggas got done up
Yeah I told that lil nigga don't run up
Yeah my bitch lookin pretty she wid' it
From them bitches that's talkin' she get it
Shit could turn right around in a minute
This bitch was just talkin' now she near the clinic
But we sinnin', hope you get it
And my shooters they move and they pivot
And you know I can't beef with no telly
If I catch him I'm painting a vision (x2)You might also likeEmbed
