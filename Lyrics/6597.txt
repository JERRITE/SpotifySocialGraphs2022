Tomorrow We Fight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep in the forest, under the fog
Armies surround us, waiting for dark
Wearing their iron masks like a shield
I know they’re coming, I know they’re here

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh woah, that light, oh woah, is bright
Sleep for today, but tomorrow we fight

[Chorus]
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight
[Verse 2]
Cold in the violence, after the war
Hope is a fire to keep us warm
Children of anger, Eden's forgot
Waiting for the hour
The battle is done

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh woah, that light, oh woah, is bright
Sleep for today, but tomorrow we fight

[Chorus]
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight

[Bridge]
(Ah, ah, ah)
Wait for the war
(Ah, ah, ah)
Wait for the war

[Chorus]
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight
Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
Tomorrow we fight
Oh, oh, oh (Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah)
Tomorrow we fight
Oh, oh, oh (Oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah)
