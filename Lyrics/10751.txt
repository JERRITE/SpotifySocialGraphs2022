DEATH FANTASY Lyrics[Intro]
(Girl)

[Verse 1]
I HAVE A DEATH FANTASY
DEATH OF MY AESTHETICS
THIS FALSE - A - FICTION
CARVED IN MY WAY
DEATH OF MY IMAGE
OF MY INTELLECT
MY ALL IS OKAY
DEATH OF MY PRETTYING
MY COZYING
MY CRAFT AND MY GRACE
CANNOT KEEP RUSHING THAT GATE
[Verse 2]
THE DEATH FANTASY
REJECTED SPACES
IN YOUR FRAMEWORKS
THEY WILL NOT GO TO ME
TO FIT INSIDE
YOUR EMPTY VISIONS
LIVID BIRD IN A CAGE
DEATH OF MY HUSTLE
MY TRAJECTORY
MY STYLE AND MY LANE
THAT FLAGRANT LOOK ON YOUR FACE

[Chorus]
I have the death fantasy
Eh, eh
Ha-ha-la-la-lujah, I'm free
Eh, eh
A charming death fantasy
Ha-ha-ha-la-la-lujah I'm free
Now, keep your hands off of me

[Verse 3]
WHAT'S TO BE SAID OF YOUR STAGE?
HAVE CHANGED THE TITLE
BUT HAVE YET TO WRITE
A SINGLE NEW PAGE
THE PRIVILEGE IS CHEAP
IF YOU CAN'T BE FREE
SO I SAID
SEEMS LIKE
THIS ONLY REPEATS
