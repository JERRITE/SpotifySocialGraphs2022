Slide Lyrics[Intro: CyHi]
It's 2 AM at the hookah spot
Told my bitch we can slide whenever
C'est la putain de merde, excuse my French
No really, excuse my French
CyHi, yeah

[Verse 1: CyHi]
It's 2 AM at the hookah spot, told my bitch we can slide whenever
Lil' momma got on a dress so tight, shit be rubbing her thighs together
Shawty, I'm a player, I tried  to tell her
I'm not the fella, that's trying to settle down
I'm more about my endeavors
Scarlet lettеr, you not Coretta
Told her I rather bе a cappella
So it's just me and my mozzarella
If it's not Buscetta, my vibe Vanilla
I'm on that shit that shot the sheriff
Girl, you ain't nobody special
If you gon' be mines, we tied together
'Cause me and my niggas gon' ride together
Birds of a feather gon' fly together
Told my shooter we can slide together
Kill one of mine, we gon' slide forever and ever
How does a nigga like Dr. Jekyll
And you know it was if it's a size 11
Never hit it raw, that's salmonella
You ain't gon' find it better
[Chorus: CyHi & Big Bank]
You know it's a sight to see when we slide together
It seems like it's every other weekend we slide together
Feel like I'm riding in a demon slide
Please, don't give me a reason slide
You know what to do when you see him slide
And we ain't cool so you need to slide
'Til the doors on the minivan won't even slide
It's a shame that you niggas won't even slide together

[Verse 2: CyHi]
I told her that we going to the high rise
Pull up in your hood like a drive-by
My partner might do it in a Tesla
Electric slide on you with it like the Cha-Cha
Everything a nigga do is Sci-Fi
Hit your old lady with the side-eye
Now we off in Magic City like ta-da
Colors in the chain like ta-da
On a PJ eating Popeyes
Jumpin' off a jet, might skydive
I met lil' momma in a Shake Shack
Taking 'bout she only been with five guys, why lie?
It's CyHi
The most luxurious, the glorious
I'm notorious for Boadicea, the victorious
Sure he is
And the moral of the story is
I'm in a class of my own
I'm on some Montessori shit
Like Morpheus in the Maxtrix, black trench coat with a bracelet (Yeah)
I'm with a pretty ho getting wasted, I don't even know where her waist is (Yeah)
Don't accept no imitations, baby, I'm a cold indication
You can tell by this silk Versace shirt, we ain't got no limitation
So is you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Glock on my lap, don't slide without it
Smoking on Maui Wowie
Me falling off? Nigga, I highly doubt it
They say that the top is lonely but shawty, the bottom's crowded
And this for them cats who killed my homie and thought we forgot about it

We ride in silence when we slide together
It seems like it's every other weekend we slide together (And it's around the time we bring the sticks like)
Feel like I'm riding in a demon slide
Please, don't give me a reason slide
You know what to do when you see him slide
And we ain't cool so you need to slide
'Til the doors on the minivan won't even slide
It's a shame that you niggas won't even slide together (Yeah)

[Bridge: CyHi]
Down the interstate, I be sliding in a drop, uh (Drop, uh)
Twelve get behind me, I be sliding on a cop, uh
Jumping off a jet like Tom Cruise off of Top Gun (Top Gun)
'Cause that's where my spot is at and plus you know I got one
Far from a lame, come and kick it with a boss one (Boss one)
Awesome, she wanna give us all somethin'
We got opps, pray to God we never cross them
Never knew how much you love someone until you lost them

[Chorus: CyHi & Big Bank]
So don't be surprised when we slide together
It seems like it's every other weekend we slide together
Feel like I'm riding in a demon slide
Please, don't give me a reason slide
You know what to do when you see him slide
And we ain't cool so you need to slide
'Til the doors on the minivan won't even slide
It's a shame that you niggas won't even slide together
[Outro: Big Bank]
Bring that Eastside
When we slide
I'm gon' ride
Before I cry, I cry
We slide together
Pussy ass nigga
Bring that Eastside
When we slide togetherEmbed
