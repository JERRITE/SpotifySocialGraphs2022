TranslationsPortuguêsEspañolMagyarOut of My System Lyrics[Verse 1]
Slowly, I never wanna go slowly
I only wanna go faster
Towards disaster every time
With me, I know you wanna come with me
Take anything you can carry
And leave everythin' else behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I am only half of what
I think I can be
[Chorus]
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it off of my chest
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest

[Verse 2]
Demons, I'm takin' all of my demons
Putting them where I won't see them
'Cause I just wanna feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I am only half of what
I think I can be

[Chorus]
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it off of my chest
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta get it out of my system, system
Gotta get it out of my system

[Chorus]
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it out of my head
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest

Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it out of my system, system
Gotta get it out of my system3Embed
