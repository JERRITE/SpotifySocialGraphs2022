I've been waiting for the day you say you want me back
I've been alone but baby, I can't seem to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
You threw my heart into the flames
I took our pictures out the frames
I tried to throw 'em out but I still keep 'em just in case
If you're wondering if I still love you after so much time has passed
Since you asked
[Chorus]
I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't
No, I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't

[Verse 2]
And I remember all the times you said you had my back
But now we're separated, goin' down our separate paths

[Pre-Chorus]
You threw my heart into the flames
I took our pictures out the frames
I tried to throw 'em out but I still keep 'em just in case
If you're wondering if I still love you after so much time away
Here's what I'll say

[Chorus]
I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't (I don't)
And I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know (I just needed you)
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't

No, I don't wanna let you go
Oh, I don't wanna let you go
No, I don't wanna let you go

[Chorus]
I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't, oh
No, I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't
No, I don't

[Outro]
But I don't wanna let you go
No, I don't wanna let you go
No, I don't wanna let you go
No, I don't wanna let you go
No, I don't9Embed
