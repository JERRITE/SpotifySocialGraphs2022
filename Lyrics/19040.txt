Upon Their Cross LyricsExploding fragments through the back of my head
Face down in silence in a puddle of red
Young lambs inhale smoke from a gun
Mother's heart burns the face of the sun

Memories screams, a fractured mind
Blending melted lead and a river of time
Darkness through a blinding  light
Peel off this corpse to witness the sight

Chorus:
One soul that ends the time
Another crosses a timeless line
Visions beyond known chaos
Be still....
Upon their cross
Evil smile from a faithlеss mind
So vacant that his power can make fools blind
Red еyes lead by demon's master
Love him come death, come disaster

Pinnacle of a Godless soul
Stagnant rotting eyes, black as coal
Resurrection of the wicked to Christ
Obedience the blood from which he survives

Chorus

I worship the hate
Pain you'll never escape
Suffocated by the deceit
You swallow down the poison, that for now, is so fucking sweet
Fuck Love

Solos: BG-PD-BG-PD-BG-PD-BG/PD

Now you carry the scars of regret
A bag of victims chained around your neck
Dead fetus pedestal, so vile you wept
Touch the face of God and feel reject

Suicide, the seeds of your life
Ornaments of rotting flesh, and broken spines
Satan fills a vein of remorse
You might also likeDull needles of decay, as you rejoice

Chorus:
One soul that ends the time
Another crosses a timeless line
Visions beyond known chaos
Be still
Upon their cross
Upon their cross
Your soul is lost
Your souls are lost
Upon their crossEmbed
