Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Lyrics[Verse 1]
She’s a loaded gun
In my shakin’ hands
Am I in hell
Or the promised land

[Verse 2]
(What’s your name)
So I’ll tell you my name when I'm on your skin
(You can be)
You can be the Queen and I’ll be the King
(I get born)
I was born to echo and I’ll never repeat
Not for anyone, anyone
[Chorus]
She said -
(Show me yours)
I’ll show you what I got, yeah
(I'll show you mine)
When you tell me what you need
(Show me yours)
You put your money where your mouth is
(I'll show you mine)

[Verse 3]
When the beat goes on
She knows that nothing’s wrong
She goes down
Like a setting sun

[Verse 4]
(What’s your name)
If I tell you my name, you got to let me in
(You can be)
You can be the sinner and I’ll be the sin
(I will take)
I’ll take what I want and its easy to see I got everything, everything

[Chorus]
(Show me yours)
I’ll show you what I got, yeah
(I'll show you mine)
When you tell me what you need
(Show me yours)
You put your money where your mouth is
(I'll show you mine)
[x2]

Watch out, watch out
(Anyplace)
I said hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Anytime)1Embed
