Lost Sparks Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let’s burn, let’s turn rubble from a love to light
Keep warm in the storm
Breathe awake a little fire
Only for the lonely nights

[Verse 2]
Rip a line from the page
Watch it fade up in smoke
Hope rise through the rain, higher than we’d ever go
Blown away, it’s gone cold you say
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s someone else’s spark
In someone else’s heart
As someone else falls in love with you

[Chorus]
And all that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get
Is sparks

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh, just sparks
Oh oh, these sparks
Oh oh, lost sparks
Oh oh

[Verse 3]
Come on, rest, take a breath
Feel your chest fall and rise
Lay by my side, watch the morning fight over you
Against the glow we knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s someone else’s spark
In someone else’s heart
As someone else falls in love with you
You might also like[Chorus]
And all that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get now
Is sparks
And all we kept from the ember’s deep red
Are the memories we let fly
Like sparks

[Bridge]
Leave me the pieces
I'll tape this back together
Don’t try to say goodbye
I’ll be fine, go on now, find another

[Chorus]
All that’s left of the fire we had
And the higher we get now
Is sparks
And all we kept from the ember’s deep red
Are the memories we let fly
Like sparks

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh, just sparks
Oh oh, these sparks
Oh oh, lost sparks
Oh oh1Embed
