Skywriting LyricsDon't cry
All the songs you sing
All the flowers you bring
Are part of everything there ever was
And will be

Go on
You've got places to be
So many things to see
Don't worry about me
I'm already where I should be
Look up
A plane writes in the sky
For every passer by
No one ever dies
They just write things in the sky

If you
Wanna think about me
Look out above the sea
And you can see that I am doing
Just fineYou might also likeEmbed
