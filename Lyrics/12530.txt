Lucky Me Lyrics[Verse]
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny
I bet on you, lucky me
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny

[Chorus]
I bet on you, lucky me
Lucky me, lucky me
I bet on you, lucky me
There's no rhyme or reason
You tell me that I'm dreaming
But this is what believing looks like
This is what believing looks like
There's no rhyme or reason
You tell me that I'm dreaming
But this is what believing looks like
But now I think I'm leaving tonight
[Verse]
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny
I bet on you, lucky me
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny

[Chorus]
I bet on you, lucky me
Lucky me
I bet on you, lucky me
There's no rhyme or reason
You tell me that I'm dreaming
But this is what believing looks like
This is what believing looks like
There's no rhyme or reason
You tell me that I'm dreaming
But this is what believing looks like
But now I think I'm leaving tonight

[Outro]
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny
I bet on you, lucky me
I like that there's no guarantee
I like that I can wait and see
I can't control my destiny
I bet on you, lucky me
