Demon Cleaner Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got the demons in me
I've got to brush them all away
I feel the demons rage
I must clean them all away

[Refrain]
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Inside I see more
Cobwebs in the way
The magic cleaner will
Shine his smile over me
[Refrain]
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I am the demon
Cleaner to save the day
I get the back one
Important they'll always stay

[Refrain]
Yeah (Yeah)

[Bridge]
If only one thing that you'll know
Impostors from the show
They'll try to trick you into
Normal treatment
Oh don't you listen to them say
Shush them all away

[Verse 4]
I am the demon cleaner
Madman of Encino
I am the freedom bleeder
Standing naked here to say
You might also like[Outro]
I'm the only way
I'm the only way
I'm the only way
I'm the only way1Embed
