Headphones Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm spending all my downtime feelin' low
She told me you don't know the half of that
'Cause you've been in your zone
You've been on the road
And I know you're dedicated
In the limelight puttin' on a show, aye
Shawty you should tone it down a bit
'Cause that shit ain't cool
And that shit ain't you
But you don't even sweat the small shit
I know that you don't
Give up so easily, no
It feels like you're letting go
We've got no room left to grow
You know I've been there before
I'd lay face down on the floor
Give up don't try anymore
I always fell asleep alone
[Chorus]
And when I woke up you were in my bed
Eyes closed with your headphones in
Like you never really cared about it
Did you ever really care about it?
And when I woke up you were someone else
No love for the way I felt
Like you never really cared about it
Like you never really cared
You never really cared at all, ye
Like you never really cared at all, ye
Like you never really cared at all, aye
No you never really cared at all, ye

[Verse 2]
Listening to songs all sad and slow, ye
I found you in a cold abyss
And you were all alone
I was in the wrong
I was fucked up and jaded
I really wanna stay but I gotta go, aye
But tell me how you feel again
The depth of your love
The things that you want
'Cause baby girl you know I'm all in
You might also like[Bridge]
I know that you don't
Give up so easily, no
It feels like you're letting go
We've got no room left to grow
You know I've been there before
I'd lay face down on the floor
Give up don't try anymore, yeah
I always fell asleep alone

[Chorus]
And when I woke up you were in my bed
Eyes closed with your headphones in
Like you never really cared about it
Did you ever really care about it?
And when I woke up you were someone else
No love for the way I felt
Like you never really cared about it
Like you never really cared
You never really cared at all6Embed
