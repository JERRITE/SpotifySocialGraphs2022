Ghost Stories Lyrics[Intro: Speaking Spanish]
No me importa que te mudes a otra Galaxia
Tú siempre estás aquí
Y sobra decir que yo vivo en un mundo dentro de ti
Porque por más lejos que estés, por más preguntas que hagas, no importa el lugar donde estés
Donde tú vives, es aquí, en mi corazón

[Verse 1]
Strap pop
Hot as black top
In that black top
Eyes flutter
As your back locks
Grip tight on your hips
Like a padlock
Is the pad locked
I don't know
I've had strings of bad luck
Clear the bed before we crush your laptop
Come on beg
Come on say my name
Like they do at shows
Only difference is I'll hear your voice
Had to comment on your legs
They feeling so nice
You engulfed
Here's some smoke
Keep your mind at ease
I hope you don't forget to breathe
[Chorus]
Ghost stories
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ghost stories
I can't hold a ghost at night
I need to get my focus right
I look around at all dead ends
The path has never looked so desolate

[Verse 2]
We've been streaking like we going through the quad
Sending all these naughty pictures of your bod
Low key I ain't even told the squad
They gone be like who's this yellow tail that he just got
But I don't really care about what they say
It's going down like mayday
Know the pain is coming but the rush feeling amazing
I might take a plane straight from LA out to Chi town
Turn this fairy tale into a lifestyle
But for right now

[Chorus]
It's ghost stories
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ghost stories
I can't hold a ghost at night
I need to get my focus right
I look around at all dead ends
The path has never looked so desolateYou might also like7Embed
