Jailbreak Lyrics[Intro]
Ahh-ah
Ahh-ah
Ahh-ah
Ahah

[Verse 1]
See, I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a mistake
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you
I've been working on a jailbreak
Keep it calm with the fast pace
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you
[Chorus]
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up (Ahah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up (Ahah)

[Verse 2]
See, I've been working on a jailbreak
Got no time for a new thing
Any moment they'll replace me
Should have tried to get to know you
I've been working on my timing
Insecurity beside me
But your taste is so inviting
Should have tried to get to know you

[Chorus]
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up (Ahah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)
And I don't think I'm ever gonna wake up (Ahah)
