TANTRUM Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck these fuckboy bands that can't think for themselves
Let's put away our black clothes and start cutting up our voices. That's what's cool now, right?

[Verse 1]
If I wasn't thin and white with blue hair would I be here?
Maybe if I kill myself you'll know I'm sincere
I'll shave my blue hair
Burn the rest of two dares
Drop from 'parks
Like "fuck it, who cares?"
But I'll tell you:
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I resent the party scene
With a part of me that's hard to see
It's turned my starry friends
To uninspired's lacking symmetry

[Chorus]
Hey, look what you've done now
I'm fucked and hope you're proud
While you follow around, around round round round
Hey, look what you've done now
I'm fucked and hope you're proud
While you follow around, around round round round

So, excuse my tantrum
Can't you see I've got my hands full?

[Verse 2]
I'm getting texts from idols I've looked up to since 15
But now people use my friends to try to get to me (Fuck you)
But we don't know you, you don't know we
We're freaked out and fragile
It's become more than a hassle
But I'll tell you:

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I resent the party scene
With a part of me that's hard to see
It's turned my starry friends
To uninspired's lacking symmetry
I resent the party scene
With a part of me that's hard to see
It's turned my starry friends
To uninspired's lacking symmetry
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey, look what you've done now
I'm fucked and hope you're proud
While you follow around, around round round round
Hey, look what you've done now
I'm fucked and hope you're proud
While you follow around, around round round round

[Bridge]
Loud gets lonely
Loud gets lonely
Loud gets lonely

But I've just got a couple more things to say really quick

To a certain married mister
That tried to move on my missus (Cam)
Try to come around again
You'll catch some swings and no misses
And to the rest
I'll keep them nameless
-Nah fuck it, here we go:

It's Richard and Clayton
And John-shit Will, yeah, y'all made it
And if I see you in person
I'm taking teeth
Trust, you've earned this
[Outro]
Thank you for coming by, today was a really good day12Embed
