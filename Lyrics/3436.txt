When I Was Yung Lyrics[Intro]
That's right
Ayy
Yung Pinch, you with the shits?
Yeah, yeah
You getting lit?
Hell yeah
Sipping on that Hennessy like, "Ooh, yeah"
Seen you with that Hennessy like, "Ooh, yeah"
Ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
Ayy, come pour some liquor in my cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn, girl, that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smokin' on this OG, now she can't get enough
Yeah, she can't get enough
Tryna live a life like she never lived before
Told lil' mama, "Live it up"
Bet she can't get enough
Yeah, bet she can't get enough
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I met this chick when I was young
She let me kiss her with my tongue
Back then I thought that shit was cool, yeah, yeah
All my homies did too, yeah, yeah
But that was back when I was young
Sneaking girls in my house
Shawty thought I was the one
Too bad it never worked out
Lemme tell ya right now
Girls just wanna have fun
Dress up nice and get drunk, yeah, whoa
You might also like[Chorus]
Come pour some liquor in my cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn, girl, that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smokin' on this OG now she can't get enough
Yeah, she can't get enough
Tryna live a life like she never lived before
Told lil' mama, "Live it up"
Bet she can't get enough
Yeah, bet she can't get enough
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I met this chick when I was young
Hit it once, she was sprung
We used to make out in her pool, yeah
Then she played me like a fool
But that back when I was young
Didn't care about shit
I was really just a kid, tryna get it in, man let me live
Life still goes on
Now she plays my songs
Say she miss my voice
Fell in love by choice
Different book, same story
Good girl, bad boy
Boy breaks girl's heart, then she fall apart, tryna fill the void
[Bridge]
Now she's
Up all night and she can't stop drinking
No, she can't stop drinking
No, she can't stop now, so

[Chorus]
Come pour some liquor in my cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn, girl, that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smokin' on this OG, now she can't get enough
Yeah, she can't get enough
Tryna live a life like she never lived before
Told lil' mama, "Live it up"
Bet she can't get enough
Yeah, bet she can't get enough
Yeah, yeah7Embed
