Translations한국어RomanizationCrush - 자나깨나 (Mayday) (English Translation) Lyrics[Chorus: Crush]
Awake or asleep (yeah yeah yeah)
Drowning in my own thoughts (yeah yeah yeah)
Always lost in thought (yeah yeah yeah)
It's alright, it’s not too bad (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Crush]
Bored, like a pebble stuck in a crack, yeah
I wanna enjoy the smell of freshly cut grass (yeah)
Summertime, ring dong, vibes
[Verse 2: Crush]
I need some excitement
Uno, dos, tres
Everything's so frustrating
You know, the stress
Eat, sleep, repeat
Not much is going on
Sitting still on the sofa
You know, the stress

[Pre-Chorus: Crush]
What's wrong with me
I did absolutely nothing today but I’m exhausted
Why is it so hard to just relax, mayday
Somebody help me, mayday
Somebody mayday, mayday, mayday

[Chorus: Crush]
Awake or asleep (yeah yeah yeah)
Drowning in my own thoughts (yeah yeah yeah)
Always lost in thought (yeah yeah yeah)
It's alright, it's not too bad (yeah yeah yeah)
Awake or asleep
(Always want that Sunday vibes)
Drowning in my own thoughts
Always lost in thought
(Always want that Sunday vibes)
It's alright, it's not too bad
