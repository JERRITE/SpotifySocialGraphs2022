Nylon Strings LyricsINTRO
This song is for my guitar
You know
The piano has always been my favorite instrument
But i have a special space in my heart for my guitar too
I know you are full of dust and its my fault, but i love you
I will give you some love tonight

(Verse 1)
Nylon strings
Acoustic scene
Hello Jesus
How you doing
Can you forgive my sins?
Again
I guess
This is part of the game
Tryna work hard i just want to make a name
Out of my passion, blood, roses
Im my own composer i would never be a poser
Openminded like these girl kissing girls's girls
Your body is my curse,put my money on your purse
Just move the studio to my bedroom
So i could do my dreams songs
Sorry to all my neighbors
I know we are living bad times, but good vibes
No sleep
Working in the studio we about to make a hit
Or not
Just another weak ass song
Weak ass verses
With the weak ass chords
I could use some inspiration so tonite im not making beats
Back to my guitar
Nylon strings
(verse 2)
But im not that cool
Damn i need more lessons
You can play the piano make the beats and the progression
But with the guitar you have never been that good
Damn i would like to play just like those guys do
On the stage
No talk, just solo's
And everybody like look at that take a photo
Or maybe a video its fantastic
But i can play with you in my bedroom thats magic
I feel like flying
Man i not lying
Acoustic versions of some classics
Im just trying
To lose myself in the music
Is so easy
Sorry for being cheesy
Its cool
When you learn to listen to music
Music begins to listen to you
Thats so me
I think its time to sleep
Music is all i need
