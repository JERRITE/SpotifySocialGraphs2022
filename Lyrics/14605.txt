Bumpy Ride (Soca Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Mohombi]
I wanna boom bang bang with your body yo (Mohombi, Marshall)
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, lemme rock you, rock you like a rodeo (RedOne, Pitbull, let's go)
The world is ours now, dale (it's gonna be a bumpy ride)


[Verse 1: Pitbull]
It's Mr. Worldwide (Yeah), yeah, you know the drill (Haha)
Everything's European, when I grab the wheel
I'm from the city where banana clips will lead you
Banana split, but I'm passed that
Throw that ass back (Dale)
It's all about the globe (Dale)
I'm taking over like Alexander the Great
Cities, countries, and states (Haha)
From the Mediterranean sea (Mohombi)
To Okeechobee Lake
You are my heart mama, hurry up and wait
[Verse 2: Mohombi]
I wanna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine (Eh-oh)
Girl, you can make me suffer, do whatever
'Cause I know you're one of a kind (Eh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Mohombi]
Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me
Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

[Chorus: Mohombi]
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride

Say put your hands up high
Hold on for the ride
First class to the sky
We can go anywhere, wanna take you there
Been waiting for the longest while
We styling, profiling, no lie
Wanna keep you by my side
No dreaming, real feeling
Hot steaming, long to the morning light
Take a jump and whine like calypso
Saddle up and ride like a rodeo
Left to right, girl, rock it in stereo
Up high then jump, take it down low
Turn me on, girl, move up your hip so
When I hold you tonight you go let go
To another world you can see
You will never find someone like me, oh

[Chorus: Mohombi]
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride (Yeah)
[Verse 4: Pitbull]
Yeah, I'm back baby (Yeah)
I know you think you're all that baby (Haha)
But damn, that ass fat baby (Dale)
I ain't gon' lie, now look at me in my eyes
And listen when I tell you, my woman's a ride or die (Woo!)
So, ain't no time to play (Nah), ain't no time to waste (Nah)
No Twitter, no Facebook, MySpace (Haha)
Tu eres mujer hecha e recha
Dime la jugada, dale mama echa (Woo!)

[Refrain: Mohombi]
I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine
Girl, you can make me suffer, do whatever
'Cause I know you're one of a kind (Eh-oh)

[Chorus: Mohombi]
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo

I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
