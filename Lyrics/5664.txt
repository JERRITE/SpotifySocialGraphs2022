Whereâ€™s My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cold bones, yeah, that's my love
She hides away, like a ghost

[Refrain]
Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

[Verse 2]
Cold sheets, oh, where's my love?
I am searching high, I'm searching low in the night
[Refrain]
Ooh, does she know that we bleed the same?
Ooh, don't wanna cry but I break that way

[Chorus]
Did she run away? Did she run away? I don't know
If she ran away, if she ran away, come back home
Just come home

[Verse 3]
I got a fear, oh, in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds high above

[Refrain]
Ooh, If you bled, I bleed the same
Ooh, If you're scared, I'm on my way

[Chorus]
Did you run away? Did you run away? I don't need to know
But if you ran away, if you ran away, come back home
Just come homeYou might also like42Embed
