â€Œtake the blame so i dont have to Lyrics[Verse]
My eyes lay heavy
You know already
Exactly where they fall
See I wasn't ready
Your aim was steady
When you shot me standing tall
My breath is yours
Your words are mine
Now you've got me speeding blind
I looked to you
To see what was right
And all I lost was time
[Outro]
My eyes lay heavy
Exactly where they fall
See I wasn't ready
When you shot me standing tallYou might also like24Embed
