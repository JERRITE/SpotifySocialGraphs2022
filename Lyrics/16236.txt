Eye to Eye Lyrics[Verse 1: Taher Shah]
Eye to eye, eye to eye
Essential, sensational eyes
My eyes and your eyes
Dreaming fairies eyes our eyes
Fabulous, exciting eyes

Eye to eye, eye to eye

[Verse 2: Taher Shah]
Keep your love in the soul
Make love with eye to eye
Your fairs and glorius eyes
I can see with my spectrum eyes
It's a genuine classic love
She will feel it romantic love
My bride, eye to eye
Glowing with your sparkling eye
Already gotta special love
Sincere promise, peaceful love

Eye to eye, eye to eye
Simple, charming eyes
My eyes and your eyes
Dreaming fairies eyes our eyes
Stylish, excellent, human eyes
Eye to eye, eye to eye

[Speech Part: Taher Shah]
Eye to eye makes happy killer love
Lifetime, once in a life, substantial
Love is heaven for the size eyes
Spectacular eyes, our eyes, my eyes, and
Your eyes. Eye to eye, eye to eye

[Verse 3: Taher Shah]

Your eyes are like a sunshine
Your precious eyes belong to me
Because I love you
True love, always smile, you are mine
Always mine, your love is faithful
Forever and ever, without you, I'm like
A butterfly... without fly

Eye to eye, eye to eye
Eye to eye, eye to eye

[Outro: Taher Shah]
Wonderful eyes, gorgeous eyes
My eyes, and your eyes, emotional
And happy eyes, all lovely eyes full
Of life, eye to eye, eye to eye1Embed
