Code of the Road Lyrics[Chorus]
I live by the code of the road
Every single night of my life
Nobody knows a single place I go
City by city, night after night

[Verse 1]
Been a long time on this lonely road, yeah
Nothing comes easy but it's worth the fight
If you've seen it once, I've seen it twice before, yeah
Little by little, night after night
[Pre-Chorus]
You've been waiting for this all of your life, yeah
The time is now to go
No hesitation, no backing down now
So just take it away

[Chorus]
I live by the code of the road
Every single night of my life
People all around you, but you're all alone
City by city, night after night

[Verse 2]
It's about time I take it nice and slow, yeah
Nothing comes easy but it's worth the fight
I say it all the time but then I start to roam yeah
Little by little, mile after mile

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been waiting for this all of your life yeah
The time is now to go
No hesitation, no backing down now
So just take it away

I live by the code of the road
Every single night of my life
Nobody knows a single place I go
City by city, night after night

[Verse 1]
Been a long time on this lonely road, yeah
Nothing comes easy but it's worth the fight
If you've seen it once, I've seen it twice before, yeah
Little by little, mile after mileEmbed
