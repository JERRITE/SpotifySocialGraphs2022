Nudes In The Pool Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Know you got a crush
Let's keep it on the hush, I hate the public shit (Oh, oh, oh)
Hate when their ego bruised and I feel the need to overcompensate (Oh, oh, oh)
Baby I can tell when you hurt (Hurt)
I need someone who knows their worth (Worth)
Yeah I could keep reminding you but if you don't feel it first
Shorty it'll never work (Work)
What if I laid you down, put it down
Showed you just how rare this is (How rare)
It's nothing that you felt, so you doubt
Let me show you how clear it is (How clear)
[Chorus]
You talking bout forever I
I'm just on this ride with you (With you)
You like it when Im honest, right?
I'm just on this ride with you (With you)

[Verse 2]
Let's not complicate it
Let's just stay elated
Love, love, let's find out how many ways to make it
Lust, lust, tell you how bad I'm anticipating
I trust, you'll find a way to repay my patience
You know I'm a star, let me shyne for you
Baby make me lose my fuckin' mind for you

[Chorus]
You talking bout forever I
I'm just on this ride with you (With you)
You like it when Im honest, right?
I'm just on this ride with you (With you)

[Verse 3]
Let's fuck around, baby Im just in the mood
You got me sending nude pictures in the pool, ooh
You be grown, Ion gotta play it cool, ooh
So mature, yeah I like the way you move
And I, I, I, I, I want you
How it feel to have the coldest in the room, in the world, huh?
And I, I, I, I, I want you
How it feel to have a boss shorty be your baby girl, huh?
You the type I'd wife
Let's figure out life
Not everybody's type
But when I am
Damn, I'm really your fucking type
I might just get naughty, mmm
Maintain my cocky, mmm
Give you a few more things to go and love about me, mm
Lets throw a party, mmm
All over my body, mmm
I know you in love
Why don’t you come tell me about it? MmmYou might also likeEmbed
