I Love to Boogie LyricsWe love to boogie
We love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie
Bolan billy boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

Belinda Mae Fender's got a Cadillac Bone
Jenny lost her cherry walking all the way home
The passions of the Earth blasted its mind
Now it's neat, sweet, ready for the moon-based grind
We love to boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

I said we love to boogie
We love to boogie
High school boogie
Jitterbug boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night

You rattlesnake out with your tailfeathers high
Jitterbug left and smile to the sky
With your black velvet cape and your stovepipe hat
Be-bop, baby, the dance is where it's at

I love to boogie
Yes, I love to boogie on a Saturday night
I said I love to boogie
I love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie on a Saturday night

I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie on a Saturday nightYou might also like1Embed
