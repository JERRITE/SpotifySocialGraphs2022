Autobiography Lyrics[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us runnin' down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (Yeah)
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees, and prayed for me when I started being violent (Okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day I don't know if I could be that (Kyuh)
But I'ma die tryin', and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron, and black out like I'm retiring (Kyuh)
Nightmares of you killin' my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Damn, I wanna run to you
Hold you and kiss you, and tell you how I miss you (I miss you, baby)
Thought I would have a son for you, but now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go (Ooh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like I'm dyin' real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt and when I'm angry (Kyuh)
You was my friend, and my man, and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

Please baby, forgive me (Forgive me)
Mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sendin' you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (Kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense
Listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the— would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (No)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you sayin'
"Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?" (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleepin', I see you in my dreams wit' me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

[Bridge: Shawn Wright & Nicki Minaj]
The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on, gotta keep on)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on (Keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I cry, the more I try, the more I try, gotta keep on, gotta keep on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep, mo–, more)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on
[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Shawn Wright]
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected (Yeah), my life reflected
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (Can you hear me? Yeah)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic22Embed
