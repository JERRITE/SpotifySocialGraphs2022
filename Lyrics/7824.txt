Trapper of the Year Lyrics[Intro: Likkle T & Nines]
Zino Records (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Ice City, jewels we nah' pity

[Bridge: Nines]
I came through in that hard-top
I saw them haters hearts drop
Oh you mad cos your crews bummy
When I come through I'm looking like some new money

[Hook: Jay Midge]
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
[Verse 1: Nines]
Uh, Ice city taking flight
That's why niggas that I barely know be claiming that we're tight
How I get more off ami than they're making off of light
Them man there come like Andy Cole the way they're playing with the white
I had LVs on my feet you was in some pumas
Selling food to the consumers now my room look like a jewellers
The worlds gone crazy everybody wanna be ballers
Could have put him on but he got a problem taking orders
Now I got most the city feeling me
But my money straight so I ain't gotta put up with this industry
But if I blow then guaranteed I put on all my niggas
Had the whole block eating from the look-outs to the hittas
I'm a legend on the street I make sure everybody eat
Giuseppe's on my feet the mandem get those every week
The street show us love cos there ain't too many real about
I woke up this morning pissed off cos it was still a drought

[Bridge: Nines]
I came through in that hard-top
I saw them haters hearts drop
Oh you mad cos your crews bummy
When I come through I'm looking like some new money

[Hook: Jay Midge]
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year

I told my chick I don't need the stress
Got old money and I got p that's fresh
Plus ammy packs and my b's the best
My plug had 20 bricks he gave me a key to test
Told him I ain't got insomnia but I need the rest
Now they're acting funny
Me, Jamal, court-side watching Andy Murray
After that I went back to the block, niggas hand me money
Now my chick saying that she stepping
Says I only care about myself and I'm a player like Beckham
Niggas violate the ting, know I'll spray them in a second
If I had a record deal I still ain't laying down my weapon
Little niggas think you're trapstars cah you flipped a box
I'm bout to whip up so much yay I need a wicked witches pot
I'm strapped I ain't taking a chance
So tell them labels I don't need a advance
I'm in the crop house feeding these plants
Since Year 9 I always knew I'd be shining
Like Bart Simpson cah after school I was grinding

[Bridge: Nines]
I came through in that hard-top
I saw them haters hearts drop
Oh you mad cos your crews bummy
When I come through I'm looking like some new money
[Hook: Jay Midge]
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year
I ain't the trapper of the year
I sold to the trappers of the year
That makes me the trappers trapper of the year4Embed
