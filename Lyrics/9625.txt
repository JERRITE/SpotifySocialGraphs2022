Me Vs. Us - Alan Walker Remix Lyrics[Intro]
Swear I wasn't alone when I lost mind
So hard to describe
But when I fell for you, I felt alive
Happened overnight

[Verse]
Like I don't know no better
Like this can't go all bad
Like there ain't no one better
Best that I ever had
I don't wanna let your love let up
So baby, tell me, tell me that I
[Refrain]
That I wasn't alone when I lost my mind
And all track of time
It's a feeling I never felt this high
Is it wrong or right?

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're one bad distraction
Here's what I'm scared I'll do
Focus my all on you
Make the trust fall for you
You know that this is all brand new, yeah
So baby, tell me, tell me that I
That I, that I, that I, that I, that I

[Chorus]
Right now it's me versus us
(Might let you, might let you, might let you win)
Might let you win just because
(Just tell me, just tell me, just tell me that)
That I wasn't alone when I lost my mind
(Just tell me, just tell me)
And all track of time
(Just tell me)
It's a feeling I never felt this high
(Just tell me, just tell me)
Is it wrong or right?

'Cause this could be bad news to you
But this is new to me
So babe, when you handle me
Handle me carefully
I know that this ain't easy for you
So baby, tell me, tell me that I

[Chorus]
Right now it's me versus us
(Might let you, might let you, might let you win)
Might let you win just because
(Just tell me, just tell me, just tell me that)
That I wasn't alone when I lost my mind
(Just tell me, just tell me)
And all track of time
(Just tell me)
It's a feeling I never felt this high
(Just tell me, just tell me)
Is it wrong or right?

[Outro]
Wrong or right?
Is it wrong or right?
Wrong or right?Embed
