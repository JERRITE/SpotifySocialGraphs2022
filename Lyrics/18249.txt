My Type (Latin Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Saweetie & City Girls & Becky G]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip
Privacy on the door, I’ma make the shit grip
Icy
Becky G (My type)
Saweetie (We got London on da track; my type)

[Chorus: Becky G & Saweetie]
100 kilates, todo caro, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that’s my type
Bien grande, uh, that's my type
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night

That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Bien grande, uh, that's my type

[Post-Chorus: Saweetie]
New wrist, new whip, ride around dipped
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed

[Verse 1: Becky G]
En la sangre llevo calentura que lo mata
De ese cuerpecito no se aguanta
Know your papi well because he’s looking at my rom pom
Becky got donk donk
Si de las que se mueven yo soy la mama cabrona, wow
Pero un huevo sin plata no me funciona
If you want me to choose, well you better have blue
This famous latina ain't fucking with you

[Pre-Chorus ]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil’ sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Bien grande, uh, that's my type
That's my type, that's my type
