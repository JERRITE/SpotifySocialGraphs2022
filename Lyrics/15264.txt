Rolled Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Mac DeMarco & Benny Sings]
Rolled up, tossed out
Trying to understand why my life's gone south
Oh I’m holed up, locked out, shut in, held down
There you are, right out of bed
The lucky charm I never had
Is this my life, it’s not too bad
Still I’m rolled up, tossed out

[Verse 2: Mac DeMarco & Benny Sings]
Roll with, without
Finally see the sun through all of those clouds
Holed up, locked out, shut in, held down
Don’t be afraid to leave it all behind
Tomorrow is a new day
Pack up and get out of here, we’re driving tonight
Until you’re back, till you’re rolled outYou might also like2Embed
