Dog Food Lyrics[Intro: IDK]
Simple
Uh-huh, uh, uh
(Woo, woo, woo)

[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
It's eleven o'clock, on the dot, I'm on the block
Ain't no time for no sleep or no yawnin' or whatnot
Twelve running 'round creepin' and peepin' for the drop
We be moving with caution, the block is really hot
[Chorus: IDK]
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)

[Verse 1: IDK]
They tried to frisk me, want me (Hot)
Incarcerated, I won't be (Hot)
I run to hit the corner (Hot)
I'm headed for the border (Hot)
Mix the weed with water (Hot)
Sold it to my auntie (Hot)
Hungry, I can't be (Hot)
So I sell it to my family
I hope they don't sing like they're tryna win a GRAMMY
I hope it ain't a act like they're tryna win a Emmy
I'm tryna get a nut, so I'm movin' like I'm Sandy
I'm livin' underwater, I don't know how I can breathe (Huh)
Maybe it's a scuba diver air tank (Air tank)
Maybe it's to do it when they say I can't (Say I can't)
Maybe it's the ears what they say I ain't
But either way, I ain't takin' that bait

[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
It's eleven o'clock, on the dot, I'm on the block
Ain't no time for no sleep or no yawnin' or whatnot
Twelve running 'round creepin' and peepin' for the drop
We be moving with caution, the block is really hot

The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is-
[Post-Chorus: IDK]
Really cold in the wintertime, cold in the summer
Cold when the wind blows, cold like December
Oh-yeah-yeah-yeah
It's gon' be cold anyway, anyway

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
The block's definition of hot, I be a simile
I know the definition of opp, that be the enemy
I seen a lot of brothers get popped, we pourin' Hennessy
And God forbid a nigga get locked, 'cause it ain't ten of me
Diez, buenos días to señoritas
We movin' units by the kiosk for fly Adidas
Forever eatin' la comida, I pack a heater
We lurkin' just to catch you lackin', like we on Cheaters
Free us, RIP us, long live us
We tried to grab the plate of what the crackers won't give us
Most of my niggas never had a Thanksgiving
So instead of givin' thanks, my niggas takin' what's given
You know what it is, set the city on fire
Girl, free the titty if you don't wear a wire
When it comes to paper, that's that shit that I require
When it comes to power, that's that shit that I desire
For real
[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
It's eleven o'clock, on the dot, I'm on the block
Ain't no time for no sleep or no yawnin' or whatnot
Twelve running 'round creepin' and peepin' for the drop
We be moving with caution, the block is really hot

[Chorus: IDK]
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is (Hot)
The block is hot, the block is-
[Post-Chorus: IDK]
Really cold in the wintertime, cold in the summer
Cold when the wind blows, cold like December
Oh-yeah-yeah-yeah
It's gon' be cold anyway, anyway1Embed
