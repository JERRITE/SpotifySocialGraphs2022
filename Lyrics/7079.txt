Mars or Maui Lyrics[Verse]
Sorry if I dub these calls
Me versus me and I must resolve
Finally grown, so I know I'm the only one involved
And I know that you doubt yourself
Why the fuck else would you come doubt me?
And I want wealth and health
Only I know what it entails
Light an incense, light an L
If I got me, then no I can't fail
I'ma tell all, I'ma keep it real
If you not down, fuck it then, oh well
They say I'm bubbly, paint it naive
'Til they can't find nobody like me
I've been on my glow, on my go though
I could never crave saying that I told you so, no
[Chorus]
All these rules still can't stop me
I got angels all on my body
And they're loving it, he's loving it
I'm loving it too
How I get better by the day, by the minute
Effortless bag, yeah, I'm all up in it
Bae, you look good, and you looking for me
I'm just tryna spare you from these wack shorties

[Bridge]
Imagine I said all the crazy shit that's on my mind (That's on my mind)
I feel like you'd like it (I feel like you'd like it)
I feel like you'd like it (I feel like you'd like it)
Imagine we did all the crazy shit that's on your mind
You'd be surprised
(Probably got a lot more in common than you realize)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whether I'm livin' on Mars or Maui
I'ma have that same charm about me, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Whether I'm livin' on Mars or Maui
I'ma have that same charm about me, oh, oh
Oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
All these rules still can't stop me
I got angels all on my body
And they're loving it, she's loving it
I'm loving it too
How I get better by the day, by the minute
Effortless bag, yeah, I'm all up in it
Bae, you look good, and you looking for me
I'm just tryna spare you from these wack shorties

[Outro]
All these rules, they don't apply to me (They don't apply to me)
All these rules, (All these rules) they never bothered me
All these rules, they don't apply to me (They don't apply to me)
All these rules, they never bothered meEmbed
