TranslationsPortuguêsFalling Asleep At The Wheel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, you never smoked this much before we met
Light up, light up another cigarette
I can tell you're drinking only to forget
Don't know how I got you in such a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to be your ray of light, your ray of light?
I get dark sometimes, does it pass you by?
I should be your ray of light, your ray of light
[Chorus]
But I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
Guess I forgot how to feel
Just for a second, you're talking
But I'm just pretending you have my attention
I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
I made you think it was real
If you think we're strong enough
Come on and wake me up

[Verse 2]
You never looked this tense before we met
Back up, back when we were so innocent
All this emotion that we're buried in
Tied up, fired up on this adrenaline

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to be your ray of light, your ray of light?
Not a cloud in sight, what a perfect night
I should be your ray of light, your ray of light
But that's not me

[Chorus]
And I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
Guess I forgot how to feel
Just for a second, you're talking
But I'm just pretending you have my attention
I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
I made you think it was real
If you think we're strong enough
Come on and wake me up, wake me up
Come on and wake me up, come on and wake me up
If you think we're strong enough, wake me up
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
Guess I forgot how to feel
Just for a second, you're talking
But I'm just pretending you have my attention
I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel
I made you think it was real
If you think we're strong enough
Come on and wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
If you think we're strong enough
Come on and wake me up, wake me up, wake me up6Embed
