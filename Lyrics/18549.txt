Figure Me Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a bit too pop for the punk kids
But I'm too punk for the pop kids
I don't know just where I fit in
'Cause when I open my mouth
I know nobody's listenin'
To the words of a prophet
Who still can't turn a profit
'Cause I don't fit in with the in crowd
But I'm too Hollywood to go back to my hometown
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they think that I'm famous
When I know I'm a fraud
Who got too fucked up on the finer things
To remember who he forgot

[Chorus]
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out

[Verse 2]
So let's get back to the basics
And take it back to the basement
Where I heard "Born To Run" for the first time
And I stared at my dad in amazement
He said, "Son don't stop chasing great
And keep pounding the pavement."
So I'd much rather die tryin' to make something sacred
Than live as another YouTube sensation

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I hate that they're famous
For being something they're not
While I'm too hung up on the things I don't have
To appreciate what I've got
You might also like[Chorus]
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out

[Bridge]
(Out)
Time for me to figure me out
Time for me to figure me out
So if you hear this song, turn it up real loud
'Cause it's time for me to figure me out
Alright, if you hear this song, turn it up real loud
'Cause it's time for me to figure me out

[Chorus]
I believe there's more to life than all my problems
I just wanna fall in love before I'm dead
So I can make my parents proud
Hope my feet don't fail me now
'Cause it's time for me to figure me outEmbed
