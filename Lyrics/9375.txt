A World Of Fantasy LyricsI was out on my own in a great big world
Thought I'd seen it all
Then along comes a woman, a fantasy
And I took the fall

I was chasing a dream, I was fancy free
I was so naive
You were all wrapped up in a mystery
You looked good to me

And I needed love I wanted it desperately
But oh, real love, you never came to me
[Chorus]
I was lost in your world of fantasy
I was caught in your game of make-believe
I was lost in your world of fantasy

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me

You were drawin' me in to a spider's web
With your hungry eyes
I was under your power I was in your spell
I was hypnotized

And oh sweet love: you wore such a strange disguise
So neat love: the way I fell for your lies

[Chorus]
All the times you lied
And all the tears I cried
I'm never gonna be the same again

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to meYou might also likeEmbed
