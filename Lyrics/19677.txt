Petty Bop Lyrics[Chorus]
Say she wanna hear a bop, huh?
It's a bop, bop
She on eddy being petty
No she don't know when to stop
Wasn't ready, heard her drop
Now she Petty Croc
Rock petty getting becky in the drop chop, chop
Since you feel like being petty, let's be petty
Call me Tom Petty, Petty Riley, Petty Murphy, Petty Wap
Petty cash, feel like petty (Petty)
Pendergrass, petty Roosevelt, yeah bitch you know I call the shots
[Post-Chorus]
Say you either die a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
That's a thought
They call me Petty Guerrero
Feel like Petty Bundy, Petty Kruger leave you hanging
Dot, dot, dot
Tuing out when you talk
That's a shame ain't it
Petty Boop, Petty Bop
That's the same damn thing
I go Loony getting top
That's insane ain't it
She thought I wasn't finna pop

[Verse 1]
Now she always got that bop on the repeat
Stop it, no stop it, no free-ee
Nigga, y'all out of pockets see-ee
Would it be more locked with the key-ey?
What's popular?
Yee-ee
Key-ed my 'op on the retreat
No shot Ibaka the d d
Are you riding or not, Kiki?
Do you love me?
Block or the stree-eet?
How sarcastic can she be?
I t-a-p her t-e
Good game, good game, baby gg
Let a nigga treat me like it don't go
I'm elite, ET, woah, woah
Hiyah, chop, chop, petty bye bye
Oh this fool here wanna die, die
You might also like[Bridge]
Niggas acting like I fell off
Wipe the guts from the shell off
Then I go the hell off
This what happens when I get like this
This bloody glove ain't 'cause I slit my wrist

[Chorus]
Say she wanna hear a bop, huh?
It's a bop, bop
She on eddy being petty
No she don't know when to stop
Wasn't ready, heard her drop
Now she Petty Croc
Rock petty getting becky in the drop chop, chop
Since you feel like being petty, let's be petty
Call me Tom Petty, Petty Riley, Petty Murphy, Petty Wap
Petty cash feel like Petty (Petty)
Pendergrass, petty
Roosevelt, yeah bitch you know I call the shots

[Post-Chorus]
Say you either die a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
That's a thought
They call me Petty Guerrero
Feel like Petty Bundy, Petty Kruger leave you hanging
Dot, dot, dot
Tuning out when you talk
That's a shame ain't it
Petty Boop, Petty Bop
That's the same damn thing
I go Loony getting top
That's insane ain't it
She thought I wasn't finna pop
[Verse 2]
Okay, okay, I guess that she ain't heard of me
Say Cuckoo University
Petty Bundy, this murder spree
Yeah bitch, I'm Petty Mercury
I'm on that radio, Gaga
Keep thinking I'm capping, nah, nah
Told her we are the champions
She yapping, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, yada
My bad, I be losing interest this fast
Keep snapping neck, get whiplash
But I still take names and I kick ass
I call her Petty LeBell
I blow, she blow this C4
She said, "Wait, ain't you JL?"
Bitch ain't a pig, pussy pork, LOL

[Outro]
Niggas acting like I fell off
Wipe the guts from the shell off
Then I go the hell off
This what happens when I get like this
This bloody glove ain't cause I slit my wristEmbed
