Chaos and Earthquakes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Black operations usin' money colored black
Dark webs gettin' spun, so politically correct
Watchin' everybody fight each other
Sister versus brother
Peace versus war
Rich against the poor
Different versus different
Bed versus the floor
Wall versus the door
Shore black, water black, money black
Money-backin' greed back in season
Spring fall in summertime for unnatural reasons
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your calling. Enterprise

[Chorus]
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

[Verse 2]
This is maniacal, entire societies are fallin'
Without a net underneath ‘em and no one digging ‘em out
The fire has gotten out of control
We got no water, no buckets, and we’re lucky if tomorrow comes
"Why" isn't important anymore
Sure, I'd like to know that need-to-know information
But when I know it
What reactions will it cause
When they finally show up dressed up, amped up in a black car?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wanna decide which side? You're a goner
Don't know which evil side is upon us this time
Mind your business. Stay in line
Find your glory, enterprise
You might also like[Chorus]
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape
Leavin' things in a state of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

[Outro]
Cuttin' away all the red tape, cuttin' away all the red tape
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
Cuttin' away all the red tape, cuttin' away all the red tape
Of chaos and earthquakes
