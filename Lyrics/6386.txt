Itchinâ€™ on a Photograph Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm itching on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm giving up on looking back
Yeah I'm letting go of what I had
Yeah I'm itching on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm letting go all of that I had
Yeah I'm itching on a photograph

[Chorus]
Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see now
That this landing ground is so
You know, you know, you know
[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm waiting on my mum and dad
Yeah I'm swinging on a branch that'll last
Yeah I'm going up then falling back
Yeah I'm itching on a photograph

[Chorus]
Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see now
That this landing ground is so
You know, you know, you know

[Bridge]
Yeah I'm itching on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat, uh-oh
Yeah I'm letting go of all that I had
Yeah I'm living now and living last
I'm itching on a photograph
Yeah I'm scratching on a thermostat
Yeah I'm letting go of all that I had
I'm living now and living last!
