The Pusher Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I've smoked a lot of grass
O' Lord, I've popped a lot of pills
But I never touched nothin'
That my spirit could kill

[Verse 2]
You know, I've seen a lot of people walkin' 'round
With tombstones in their eyes
But the pusher don't care
Ah, if you live or if you die
[Chorus]
God damn, the pusher
God damn, I say the pusher
I said God damn
God damn the pusher man

[Verse 3]
You know the dealer, the dealer is a man
With the love grass in his hand
Oh but the pusher is a monster
Good God, he's not a natural man

[Verse 4]
The dealer for a nickel
Lord, will sell you lots of sweet dreams
Ah, but the pusher ruin your body
Lord, he'll leave your
He'll leave your mind to scream

[Chorus]
God damn, the pusher
God damn, God damn the pusher
I said God damn
God, God damn the pusher man

Well, now if I were the president of this land
You know, I'd declare total war on the pusher man
I'd cut him if he stands, and I'd shoot him if he'd run
Yes, I'd kill him with my Bible and my razor and my gun

[Outro]
God damn, oh, the pusher
God damn the pusher
I said God damn
God damn the pusher man...1Embed
