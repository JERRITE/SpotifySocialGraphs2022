[Chorus]
All Summer I been feeling saudade (wait)
Melancholic I lost somebody the hardaway
We was so close now you so far away
All summer I been feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade, Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade (ay) Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
[Verse 1]
I was tryna understand how it feels for you
And I really would've known if you just told me the truth
Everybody run away they ain't got shit to prove
Feels like I'm going insane I don't got shit to do
Tell me she wanna be free
Why can it not be with me
Should've done better but I found my peace
Now you just left here me falling to pieces
And now every single thing that I see
Turning to a memory
Shawty been hella rude lately
Now I feel alone like on the daily

[Bridge]
Hol' up, tryna understand shit (wait)
I been tryna understand this (what)
Like damn how you just vanished (damn)
Remember We was living lavish (ay)

[Chorus]
All Summer I been feeling saudade (wait)
Melancholic I lost somebody the hardaway
We was so close now you so far away
All summer I been feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade, Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade (ay) Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
You might also like[Verse 2]
I find comfort in knowing that you been living so happy
I just don't even get how I was so problematic
There was a time in my life; if I want it then I had it
But now my luck changed, fear I'm finna be an addict
Molly, Xan, Weed everybody popping Addies
Numb the pain Novocaine then I started rapping
On some real shit I ain't even know what would've happened
If my lil homie Shawn couldn't handle the damage (like)

[Chorus]
All Summer I been feeling saudade (wait)
Melancholic I lost somebody the hardaway
We was so close now you so far away
All summer I been feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade, Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
Saudade (ay) Saudade (ay)
All summer I been Feeling saudade (ay)
