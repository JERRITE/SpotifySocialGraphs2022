Girlie LyricsHopelessly showbiz associates
She's got friends you haven't met
They smoke menthol cigarettes
Bogus psychosis
She floats on in
She ain't ever anywhere
So you're lucky that she's here

Talk about Hollywood problems
She's got 'em
She's always looking for a wilder ride
And she'll be fuckin' with her phone all night
She calls me "Girlie"
She gets in corners where water can't
Got that look upon her face
Says she's twenty-minutes late
Her shit is sorted
She's all for it
â€˜Til her eyeballs start to bleed
She don't wanna go to sleep

Talk about ladder to stardom
She's on one
And if that doesn't whet your appetite
Well she's probably got something that might
She calls me "Girlie"

Talk about Hollywood problems
She's got 'em
She's always looking for a wilder ride
And she'll be fuckin' with her phone all night
She calls me "Girlie"
