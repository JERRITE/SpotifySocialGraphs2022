Glad and Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thank you kindly for thinking of me
If I'm not smiling I'm just thinking

[Verse 2]
Glad and sorry, happy or sad
When all is done and spoken
You're up or I'm down

[Chorus]
Can you show me a dream?
Can you show me one that's better than mine?
Can you stand it in the cold light of day?
Neither can I
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Can you show me a dream?
Can you show me one that's better than mine?
Can you stand it in the cold light of day?
Neither can IYou might also like1Embed
