Chemical High (Deluxe Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't let the heat go down
On the dial when you're by-y
And I love the way I see the world
Through your eyes, ride or die, die

[Chorus]
Fly-y
If you wanna feel it, well, I just wanna dri-ve
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
If you really mean it, well, we can paint the sky-y
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
[Pre-Drop]
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You givе me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give mе that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling-

[Bridge]

You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh
You give me that feeling, that chemical high-igh

[Verse 2]
When I'm close to you, I get the feeling that I'm home (Feeling that I'm home)
Still, I've lost all control, oh-oh
When I look at you, I know I'll never let you go
Never let you go, ah-aah
