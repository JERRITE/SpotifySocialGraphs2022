Julia Says LyricsHere we go again, thru the backstreets of my mind
It seems my life was standing still
Who's sorry now, it's funny how I didn't know it
Here we go again, fighting things we never win
It seems our love was standing still I'm sorry now
It's funny how I don't feel the love
I just hear the words, Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see
Love hurts
I won't be fooled again, looking for the dreams I couldn't find
The dreams for me were left behind
I'm sorry now, It's funny how
I don't feel the love
I just hear the words, Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see, love hurts
Julia please, open your eyes and see
Julia wants to be on here own
Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone
Dreaming of the things she wants to be
Where Julia don't belong
Julia said
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't know, C'Mon Julia
She doesn't know what it's all about
