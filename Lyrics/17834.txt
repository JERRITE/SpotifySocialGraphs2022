Exposing Me Remix Lyrics[Intro: Rah Swish & Curly Savv]
Steve Chea on the Beat
9 shots in the Ruger
Gang, gang, gang
I step on the court they like, "Watch the shooter"
Fuck is ballin', bro
Grrt, baow, baow, baow
Sit the fuck down

[Verse: Rah Swish & Curly Savv]
I'ma state the facts, 3 niggas took a flight, OT an' them niggas ain't make it back (For real)
Too many shooters on the scene, we hit 'em, like, "Who stain is that?"
Niggas rats, they askin' 'bout the opps an' like, "Who name is that?"
Tried to take vacations an' got hit, I know they hated that
Mr.-Catch-Me-A-Opp, and leave his facial flat
They like Curly Savv back again, they couldn't wait for that
You was GDK but now you folk, today what gang you jack?
I ain't gonna say what I'ma say 'cause I know these rats
We do not try to play wit' 'em, miss him an' you can lay wit' 'em
Shoot till them bullets deliver, get hit an' them niggas play victim
They call 'em opps 'cause them niggas fans, they been on my dick, uh
Too many [?] 50s [?] that still slide 'cause [?] rich
Uh, blixky, blixky, blixky, that shit dead flop
Sniper gang K, bullets knock out your left eye
If you drop the woo, bitch, we comin' for your head top
Bitches gettin' hit, ain't no warnings or no next time
Big NBA, bitch, you know how we be, [?] took his phone and his ring
Nigga was runnin' it, causin' a scene, I'm waitin' outside the court with a beam
16 is a bitch, I let these bullets grip him up, call [?] come an' pick him up
Your BM a treesh on the gang I could get a fuck but I think my zipper stuck
Jeffrey? Come an' test me
I got 22 in this XD
You ain't hit nobody that was Max B
So stop actin' tough 'fore I bend the Gs
Where would they be if we didn't start it?
Hop out the V if he look like a target
Fly with a hoodie, I'm feelin' like Artist
Folks in the spliff [?]
[?] get on they addys and then I go chill after
Shoot if he with 'em, even if he a white drill rapper
And to all the drill rappers who ain't know that I still rap
If I ain't wildin' then I know for sure that Rah Swish gon' still snap
Tag one for this drill shit, these opp niggas they still wack
Still fuckin' on a opp bitch, when I touchdown, I'ma kill that
[?] coat, that shit was close
Coka was just talkin' tough that he gangster, then he got exposed
And go bring up when he got posted up on the court 'cause that shit was old
22 came home [?] witness 'cause that nigga told
[Outro: Curly Savv]
Ah, yeah, yeah, that nigga told
Ah, all the opps some hoes, haha
They don't want no smoke, nah, nah
Especially wit' my gang, niggas ain't got no dough, hahaYou might also likeEmbed
