Take Care of You Lyrics[Intro: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to
I'm always ready for your love
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to
I'm always ready for your love

[Verse 1: Charlotte Day Wilson]
Wait for it
You'll come around like I've prayed for it
Wearing your cross on my chain for it
Even we're blind to believe
Oh, but stay for it
I'll part the seas the seven days for it
Down on my knees as you came four times over me, oh
[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to
I'm always ready for your love

[Verse 2: Syd]
What if we fight for it?
Twelve rounds and more every night for it
Fly to the Moon and back twice for it
All for our love, oh, I'll be nice for it
I'll take a breath, close my eyes for it
Still wanna leave on the lights for it
More about us, oh

[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to
I'm always ready for your love
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to
I'm always ready for your love

[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to, I'm
I'll take care of you if, if you want me to, I'm

[Outro: Syd]
If only I had been sure of myself
I could have shown you just what to do
'Cause only you can make me feel this way
And I know I'd take care of you, ohYou might also like3Embed
