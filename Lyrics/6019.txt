TranslationsPortuguÃªsLove Love Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, maybe I'm a crook
For stealing your heart away
Yeah, maybe I'm a crook
For not caring for it
Yeah, maybe I'm a
Bad, bad, bad
Bad person
Well, baby, I know

[Verse 2]
And these fingertips
Will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes
Can only meet mine
Across a room
Filled with people that are
Less important than you
[Chorus]
All 'cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you

[Verse 3]
So I think it's best
We both forget
Before we dwell on it

[Bridge]
The way you held me so tight
All through the night, till
It was near
Morning

[Chorus]
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love

You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You
You might also like[Chorus]
All 'cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love

You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You
