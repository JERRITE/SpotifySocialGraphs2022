Hot Wings (I Wanna Party) Lyrics[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Party in the Ipanema baby

[Chrous: Jamie Foxx, both]
I want to party
I want to samba
I want to party
I want to samba
I want to party
And live my life (My life)
I want to party (Party)
And fly
[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx, will.i.am, both]
Hey!
I'mma fly, fly just like a bird
(But you are a bird)
Oh yeah, you're right
So let me fly just like a rocket then (Okay!)
Fly so high where I need to come down for oxygen (Hey!)
'Cause once we start it, baby
Ain't no, ain't no stopping then (Hey!)

'Cause I just want to live my life and party! (Hey!)
All I want is to be free and rock my body (Okay!)
Ain't nowhere around the world that I want to live my life
In Rio, 'cause in Rio, 'cause in Rio I realize that

[Chrous: Jamie Foxx, both]
I want to party (Party)
I want to samba (Party)
I want to party (Party)
And fly

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I'm that samba
Samba master, master, master, master, master
Who shouts out?
I'mma get your blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster
You dance fast
But I dance faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
You too slow, you need to catch up
You can dance and dance but
You might also like[Chrous: Jamie Foxx, both]
I want to party (Party)
I want to samba (Party)
I want to party (Party)
I want to samba (Party)
I want to party (Party)
And live my life (My life)
I want to party (Party)
And fly
