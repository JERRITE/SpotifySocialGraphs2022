I Wanna Testify LyricsWe met each other introduced by her brother
A cat I'd known all my life
Parties and dancing,moonlight and romancing
Soon to be husband and wife
My friends call me crazy,her folks call her lazy
But our love counts for life
If we stuck together the pressures we would weather
Not knowing we were in for a fall
Women and drinking Loving and thinking
They do it to you every time
Women and drinking Loving and thinking
They do it to you every time
Find yourself going down down down down
I'm going down down
I'm going down down down down down down down
Ow - I just wanna testify
What the women don't owe to me
I just wanna testify
What the women don't owe to me

We had a boy
My pride and joy
I took a job day and night
Tired and wired
One day I got fired
That's when we started to fight

With time on his hands
A man ain't a man
And all he loves he starts to neglect
I didn't go far
Straight to the bar
And drank up all my self respect

Women and drinking Loving and thinking
They do it to you every time
Women and drinking Loving and thinking
They do it to you every time

I'm going down down
I'm going down down down down down down down
Ow - I just wanna testify
What the women don't owe to me
I just wanna testify
What the women don't owe to me

Yeah - let me get on back to my story now

Yeah - cared about no-one
But my wife and my son
That's when I started to roam
Bar room to bedroom
It happened so soon
I found myself on my own
She went back to her mother
I fought with her brother - yeah
And in my heart I know I was wrong
Please pay attention to the words that I mention - yeah
And listen to the moral of the song

I just I just wanna testifyEmbed
