High Time Baby LyricsI'm gonna put it this a-way, all I hoped has come for me
The things you had to say, you could have told me yesterday
High high high time baby, high time you come back with me

High high high time baby, won't you come along with me?
High high time baby, who can your other man be?
Well the change has got to come, ah let me know what's wrong with me

Get that feeling in the day, in the night time too
How can you treat me this a-way? don't know all the things you do
Ah please change your mind, pretty baby, high high high time
High high high time baby, won't you come along with me?
High high time baby, who can your other man be?

Well the change has got to come, pretty baby, let me know what's wrong with me, come on

I'm gonna put it this a-way, (? )
The things you have to say, you could have told me yesterday
High high high time baby, high time you gotta back with

Come on come on come on baby, come on home with me
Ah come on come on baby, come on home with me
Well a change has got to come, ah let me know what's wrong with me

Come on come on come on come on baby, I wanna know, I wanna know
Come on come on come on baby, who can the other man be
Well the change has got to comeYou might also likeEmbed
