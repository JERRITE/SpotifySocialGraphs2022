The Most Beautiful Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Will it be a pavement or a sidewalk
When I finally lay my eyes on you?
Someone I've already loved
Or will you find your way out of the blue?
Will it be my flat or your apartment
When I finally realize I do?
Will we meet on Baker Street
Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen
[Verse 2]
Someone on a screen asked me a question
Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance
Or general compatibility

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seenYou might also like6Embed
