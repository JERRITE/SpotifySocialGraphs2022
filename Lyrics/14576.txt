So Incredible LyricsShe's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
(So incredible uh)
(So incredible uh)
(Drop the beat so I can let it flow uh)
(So I can let you know Uh)
She's So Incredible
There is just so many ways
She's got me so amazed
Telling everybody I ain't ever seen that type before
Cause I just can't believe
What's gotten over me
They don't understand why you trip me
Is it the way that she kisses me
Cause I know it gives me butterflies
Is it the way that she touches me
Whenever I look into her eyes
Is it the way she listens
Every time I talk
So exciting
Every time I call
Never felt this way
And That's How I know
She's the only one that I desire
She's the only one that lights my fire
Every time I'm down
She takes me higher
If I only had one word to describe her
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
Her sexy attitudes
Got me so mesmerized
The way she puts it down
Got me so hooked, I just can't get enough
Doing things that I don't
She keeps me on my toes
The way I feel I just can't explain it
What can I say she's incredible oh
In my arms, never let her go
When I feel like a king
With only one ring
She's my only queen
Never give up the throne oh
My only reason to live
Let me show you my love
Baby it's the season to give
Fight for our right to love
And as we rise above weï»¿ gonna live again
She's the only one that I desire
She's the only one that lights my fire
Every time I'm down
She takes me higher
If I only had one word to describe her
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
I just can't leave her alone
Got me blowing up her phone
I'm going out of my way
To see my girl everyday
Cause I gotta be with her
When she's not around I miss her
No one else can do what she does
Cause she's the only one
So official
All of the problems in my life, don't apply
Girl it's not an issue
So incredible no need to convince you
Matter of fact that's the one kind of word that fits you
You're in my life
So my answer is heaven
When an angel, reminisce what I've been through
And put underneath from the creep, 6 feet deep
Leaks in the sea, can't forget you, come on
She's the only one that I desire
She's the only one that lights my fire
Every time I'm down
She takes me higher
If I only had one word to describe her
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
She's So Incredible
