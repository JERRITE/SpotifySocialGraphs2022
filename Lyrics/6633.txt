Don’t Give Up on Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you're falling backwards and no one's catching ya
When your heart just shatters, too many pieces to pick it up
You keep finding a way, just to live alone
Nothing to say, staring at your phone
And your life is going numb (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Don't give up on love when it doesn't work out the first time
Close your eyes and trust that you gotta get low to get high
The world's full of second chances, you gotta keep on dancing
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up on love
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up on love
[Post-Chorus]
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on love
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on love

[Verse 2]
Livin' underwater and you can't catch your breath
Driftin' farther, almost off the edge
You keep thinking about all the better days
Spiraling out, wishing it would change
Smiling through the pain (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Don't give up on love when it doesn't work out the first time
Close your eyes and trust that you gotta get low to get high
The world's full of second chances, you gotta keep on dancing
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up on love
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up on love

[Post-Chorus]
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on love
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on love

Don't give up on love (Oh) when it doesn't work out the first time (First time)
Close your eyes and trust that you gotta get low to get high (To get high)
The world's full of second chances (Oh-oh-oh), you gotta keep on dancing (Keep on dancing)
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up on love

[Post-Chorus]
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on love
If it doesn't work out the first time
G-Gotta get low to get high
If it doesn't work out the first time
Don't give up on loveEmbed
