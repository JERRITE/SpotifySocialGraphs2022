Defy Gravity LyricsWe'll defy gravity
We’ll kiss the clouds
We'll defy gravity
We won't’ fall down
We'll defy gravity

Elegant mistakes
Succulent success
Innocent ducks and drakes
Imitate remakes
Movies, cinema
Appreciate opera
Forget about rules that suffocate
Dreams like hot air balloons
Touch the clouds enjoy the view
Holiday on the moon
Sail our ships on monsoons
Discover our own galaxy
Start a world with harmony
Forget about fear and gravity

We'll defy gravity
We'll kiss the clouds
We'll defy gravity
We won't' fall down

We'll defy gravity
Erase our frowns
We’ll defy gravity
Floating on these marshmallow clouds

We’ll defy gravity
We'll kiss the clouds
We’ll defy gravity
We won't' fall down

We'll defy gravity
Erase our frowns
We’ll defy gravity
We'll kiss the clouds
We'll defy gravityYou might also likeEmbed
