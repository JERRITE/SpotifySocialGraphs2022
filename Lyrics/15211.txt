Automatic Fantastic Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the needle hits wax it won't be long
You got your radio tuned but it won't play this song
It's the sweetest sound you ever heard
And the metal flaked cherries, always pass the word

[Verse 2]
You rub your genie down to get the news
It's time to ride with the strange dudes
Suns up, and we like it hot
And we take our time... 'Cause it's what we got
[Verse 3]
Yeah, the man shakes me down and that's why I'm broke
The rich man's got all the green, but it ain't the kind ya smoke
So we turn up the rock, and we roll it slow
And we're always flying high... and the ride's always lowYou might also likeEmbed
