Everythingâ€™s Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
And do you ever feel like you're alone?
And do you ever wish you'd be unknown?
I can say that I have
I can say that I have
And do you ever feel things here aren't right?
And do you ever feel the time slip by?
And I can say that I have
And I can say that I have

[Chorus]
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
[Verse 2]
And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself don't try?
Don't try to let yourself down
Don't try to let yourself down
And do you ever see yourself in love?
And do you ever take a chance my love?
Because you know that I will
Because you know that I will

[Chorus]
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic

[Bridge]
Everything, everything's magic....

[Chorus]
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magicYou might also like11Embed
