Double Talk LyricsEvery time I asked you to be truthful you lied
And when I lost my temper you cried
Crocodile tears and spoke double talk
It's the same old alibis and stories again
I redeye there to meet you and then
All you ever give me is double talk

You think that love means cope
Your life is like some daytime soap
Where all the dialogue is just double talk
Well I've got news for you
This little drama's through
'Cause I can't take no more of your double talk
Your double talk
You're so jive - sometimes I think your brain was mislaid
You've broken every promise you made
You ought to see a doctor for double talk

Never mind 'bout all the times we started again
I had the idea there to meet you and then
All you ever give me is double talk

Your brand of kindness smarts
You call me when I'm on the charts
But all you ever give me is double talk
Well I've got news for you
This little drama's through
'Cause I can't take no more of your double talk
Your double talk

Musical Interlude

It may come as quite a shock
But I'm hip to your double talk
All you ever give me is double talk
Each time you lie your profile grows-
It looks just like Pinocchio's
And I can't take no more of your double talk

It may come as quite a shock
But I'm hip to your double talk
All you ever give me is double talk
Each time you lie your profile grows-
It looks just like Pinocchio's
And I can't take no more of your double talkYou might also likeEmbed
