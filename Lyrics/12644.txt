Line It Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’m feeling like a stranger
‘Cause I’m stuck here
Living like my parents is my worst fear
They had some kids
And got lost in the suburbs
Working jobs they hated made them suffer

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d rather die
Than live my father's life
And pretend like I’m satisfied
[Chorus]
So line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
I’m diving off the еdge

[Verse 2]
Crashing in these sеcond-hand motel rooms
Driving 'cross the country ‘cause I want to
I can’t slow down
Because I’m scared to stand still
I can’t go home
Because it feels like hell

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’d rather die
Than live my father's life
And pretend like I’m satisfied

[Chorus]
So line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
I’m diving off the edge

Why should I come back to earth
When all that’s there is tears and hurt?
There’s absolutely nothing there for me, for me

Diving off the edge feels good
I’m finally not misunderstood
I know that there is no way I can stay
I’d rather die than ever live my life that way
I’d rather die than ever live my life that way

[Chorus]
So line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
Line it up for me
Steal away my dreams
‘Cause I don’t need no sleeping
When I’m diving off the deep end
I’m diving off the edge
I’m diving off the edge
I’m diving off the edgeEmbed
