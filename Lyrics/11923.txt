Poof Lyrics[Intro]
Aw shit
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

[Chorus]
No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, woah
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, woah
No snitch, I get money, must admit, woah
Yo bitch work with me, submit, woah
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, woah
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, woah
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, woah
Spillin' panda on my designer, it's tragic, woah
[Verse 1]
Boy Meets World, you can be my Topanga
I don't wanna fall in love with a stranger
Boy Meets World, we got history like Feeny
Love you deeply, yeah, completely
Like a survey, baby, you complete me
Screamin', "Jordan, ballin' like a three-peat"
I'm important, she actin' like she need me
Girl, you're gorgeous, you could be on TV
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

[Chorus]
No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, woah
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, woah
No snitch, I get money, must admit, woah
Yo bitch work with me, submit, woah
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, woah
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, woah
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, woah
Spillin' panda on my designer, it's tragic, woah

[Verse 2]
I just wanna do it, I don't wear Adidas
Got shit movin' in like I need a visa
Gotta get all this cheese like I ordered pizza
I don't chase no pussy, hell no, I'm no cheetah
I am a believer, I'm an overachiever
This is the procedure, don't want no more seizures
Wanted to be rich as a kid, my wrist a new freezer
Thumbin' through all these bands, such a stress reliever
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, woah
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, woah
No snitch, I get money, must admit, woah
Yo bitch work with me, submit, woah
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, woah
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, woah
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, woah
Spillin' panda on my designer, it's tragic, woah

[Outro]
Da-da-da-da-damn Pi'erre, where'd you find this?
