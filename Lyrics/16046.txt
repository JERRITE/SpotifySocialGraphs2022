Just That Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels
Like everybody wants something from me
Don't understand, I can only be one person, that's Joey
Got game, got fame, got everything in this world I need
But the girl, I don't know her name
'Cause I've only met her in my dreams
But I'm gonna find her 'cause she's

[Chorus]
Just that girl, the one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy, she's a dime
And it's almost like I can see her, she's just that girl
[Verse 2]
Something happens when you groove
Earth beneath you starts to move
It's so bad, I'm lookin' at you
'Cause you are that girl
Crazy how you work that frame
You and me, we could change the game
What's your secret? What's your name?
(That girl)
To me you're a star
When you move you're off the charts
You've already won my heart
That girl
To me you're a star
You don't have to play the part
You can be just who you are
'Cause you're just that girl

[Chorus]
The one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy, she's a dime
And it's almost like I can see her, she's just that girl

[Post-Chorus]
Yes, she know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl
She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl
You might also like[Bridge]
Just that picture in my mind I see
And I can't wait for the day we meet
Baby, we'd be so fly, baby just you and I
I wanna give you the world 'cause you're

[Chorus]
Just that girl, the one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy, she's a dime
And it's almost like I can see her, she's just that girl

[Post-Chorus]
She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl
She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girl

[Chorus]
The one that's dancin' through my mind
Just that girl, the girl that I've been tryna find
Just that girl, her style is crazy she's a dime
Almost like I can see her, she's just that girl
(Almost like, almost like)
[Post-Chorus]
She know she's just that girl
She know she's just that girl
That girl baby, just that girlEmbed
