Come Alive Lyrics[BARNUM]
You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake
'Cause you're just a dead man walkin'
Thinkin' that's your only option
But you can flip the switch
And brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blindin'
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same
Come alive
Come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reachin' up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

And the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were livin' in
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
So come alive

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

[LETTIE]
No more livin' in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes
You might also like[LORD OF LEEDS]
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

[ODDITIES]
We got a little lightnin' strikin'
Bottled up to keep on shinin'
You can prove there's more to you

[BARNUM]
You cannot be afraid

[ODDITIES]
Come alive
Come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reachin' up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
So come alive
Come one, come all
Come in, come on

[ANNE]
To anyone who's burstin' with a dream

[ODDITIES]
Come one, come all
You hear the call

[BARNUM]
To anyone who's searchin' for a way to break free

[ODDITIES]
Break free
Break free

[BARNUM & ODDITIES]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open (Hey!)

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
So come alive (Come alive, yeah!)25Embed
