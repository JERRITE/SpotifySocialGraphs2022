4Get U Lyrics[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
How could I ever forget you?
(Ever forget you?)
Never forget you
(Never forget you)
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
Forget you
You know what? Forget you!
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
[Verse 1: Young Wicked]
I've been in the game
And it's all the same
People just wanna talk down on your name
And it doesn't matter how much you have changed
Your only as good as your greatest mistakes
And so many hypocrites, equally sinning
There's really no difference between you and I
Except for the fact that I followed that someone you once all up on pages at night
Talk about how they ain't doing it right
They don't see
I'm really moving with mine
Radio city, the crew is behind
Walking with cops
I'm doing divine?
So we were rolling and you fell the fuck off
I ain't really tripping
I pray you're forgiving the way that I am living
I'm permanently getting it all and never gonna be giving it up, nah

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
How could I ever forget you?
(Ever forget you?)
Never forget you
(Never forget you)
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
Forget you
You know what? Forget you!
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be

The game is corrupt, so we be on alert
'Cause people abuse and take advantage of your work
Every word spoken, every door open
Every wrong written letter
That we're hoping that we stay ocused
And we don't sleep
Who's footing on some dumb shit?
Better mother or dumb bitch
Brush the dirt of my shirt and get back on my work
I'm a sick spit
And in the midst the crowd
Fame, money and politics
How distorted can it get it
Like a Band-aid, or a quick fist on the wound of a lunatic
And I'm bleeding out the dome
To the page and the microphone
Can't believe my ears when you say I'm wrong
And my feeling's gone
And I move along

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
How could I ever forget you?
(Ever forget you?)
Never forget you
(Never forget you)
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
Forget you
You know what? Forget you!
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
[Verse 3: Ekoh]
Yeah
So put those headphones on
And blast that shit so you escape
And thank us for the lyrics
Like, we wrote that shit so you relate
So when you down I'm here for you
But what do you do when I need help?
Just talk shit on the internet if one song isn't fire as hell
These letters diminish you
This media, Hollywood shit and the money that's running it
'Cause some of the people
They're fickle
They love you one day
And the next they don't fuck with it
Now see, I'm human
And I think you forget that I really been giving my heart to this
I think [?] like you, like using an artist

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
How could I ever forget you?
(Ever forget you?)
Never forget you
(Never forget you)
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
Forget you
You know what? Forget you!
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be

[Verse 4: Monoxide Child]
I think you forgot what being honest is
You're so departed of the truth like William Costigan
There's no substance anymore, you're all collegian
And I refuse to ever play myself for acknowledgment
I've changed what I hadn't
Maybe that's the problem 'cause some say that I haven't
Everything is one way, the run's always tragic
Feel's like you're turning
Your back on the real challenge
The blood, sweat and tears that bring you the real magic
I don't think I'll ever understand and that's tragic
But here I go right back at it
It's my bad habit
Bending on the back
That's damaged
Yes I'm back at it

[Hook: Jamie Madrox]
How could I ever forget you?
(Ever forget you?)
Never forget you
(Never forget you)
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be
Forget you
You know what? Forget you!
And I don't expect you to feel the same way for me
I understand some things sometimes are meant to be2Embed
