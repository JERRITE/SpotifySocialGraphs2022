Soul Bleed Lyrics[Damn BT]

[Chorus]

They wonder why my soul bleed
How you switch up just like that, you was my homie
Yeah they talk behind my back, but don't approach me
You let em talk behind my back, but never told me
You gon make me, loose this fuckin mask, and show the old me
Loyalty, before royalty, how it’s pose to me
Man, these niggas claimin they gon ride, never rode for me
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to be
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to be
[Verse 1]

Who that boy, and where he from
Why he wanna know me
Niggas watchin, tryna play me close, like they know me
Don't just tell me that you love me, gotta show me
I can't clock that bitch, ain’t got no time in this rollie
Water on that AP
And it's fuck all of them niggas, if they hate me
Imma chase the paper and I bet that bitch gon chase me
My music go ROCNATION, I ain't talkin Jay Z
I won't let em, snake me take me, away from my people
You do for yaself, I do for us, can't say we equal
They gon judge you first, based on ya pass, before they meet you
Why the fuck, you turn yo back on me, when I need you

[Chorus]

They wonder why my soul bleed
How you switch up just like that, you was my homie
Yeah they talk behind my back, but don't approach me
You let em talk behind my back, but never told me
You gon make me, loose this fuckin mask, and show the old me
Loyalty, before royalty, how it's pose to be
Man these niggas claimin they gon ride, never rode for me
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to be
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to be

If I gave you all my trust, tell me what would it, cost me
Can't cross me, If you triple crossin, thats multiple losses
I go deep into that ocean, they tell me be cautious
The way my life was headed, never thouught i’ll be a artist
I was broke, only had my brothers fore all this started
Use to scrape for cash, couple bags, out the market
Youngins pumpin gas, they on ya ass, before you park it
I was aiming, for the league, never hit my target
Everything change cause they let the ellis spark
I had demons in my mind, somehow them demons departed
They comeback time after time, thats why a nigga so heartless
I go rhyme for rhyme, yeah they know that im the hardest
You gotta finish, wit who started witchu
Dont trydda play both sides, you gon die, in the middle
It’s fucked up, how they wait until you die, to show they miss you
Dont make me make the call, them killas dyin to get you
I done earned my stripes back then, and now im still official
I dont really cry, so when I cry, get the tissue
Cause ion really wanna, show this side when im witchu
Rather keep it in my mind, cause it's my type of issue

[Chorus]

They wonder why my soul bleed
How you switch up just like that, you was my homie
Yeah they talk behind my back, but don’t approach me
You let em talk behind my back, but never told me
You gon make me, loose this fuckin mask, and show the old me
Loyalty, before royalty, how it's pose to me
Man these niggas claimin they gon ride, never rode for me
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to be
I heard them niggas switchin sides, thats where they pose to beEmbed
