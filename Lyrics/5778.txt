Start Anew LyricsHelp me understand or take me as I am
I'll change my point of view, anything for you
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew

Darling, can't you see something deep inside of me
I'm gonna change your mind
Say that you'll be mine
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Wipe away those tears
Please don't be upset
Tell me all your fears
This I will address
Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Me and you

Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Me and you

Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Me and you

Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Me and you

Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah

Got the whole world in our hands
Come on take a chance and start anew
Me and you
