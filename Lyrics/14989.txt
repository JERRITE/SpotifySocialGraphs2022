Slither Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
When you look, you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Born and broken every single time

Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you run to me
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind
[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see

[Bridge]
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

[Verse 2]
When you seek me, you destroy me
Rape my mind and smell the poppies
Born and bloodied every single time

Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you might linger
But I see some type of pleasure in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me
You might also like[Bridge]
When you look you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Born and Bloodied
Every single time

[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me

[Outro]
(Hey)
(Hey)
