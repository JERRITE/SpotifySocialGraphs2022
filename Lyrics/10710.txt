Sip of My Sip Lyrics[Intro]
Think about tomorrow
Think about tomorrow
Think about tomorrow
Think about tomorrow
Think about tomorrow

[Verse 1: Cakes da Killa]
High design in a low-rise jean
I hear you doin' strange things just to get to the cream
The scene callin' me the GOAT 'cause I spit supreme
Been all around the world, take some tips from me
You was takin' naps when I was hittin' the scene
Follow my lead, these biters tryna swallow my schemes
Dream my dreams, fuck around and rock my seams
'Cause every time I'm on the block all I hear is
See me, the blueprint, never had to prove shit
I'ma make it pop like Lil Mama with the movement
Give me what you got off the top like you loose lipped
This is for the queens in the crib gettin' stupid
Poor little rappers, go and get a clue, bitch
We are not the same, I ain't kissin' on no Judas
Don't confuse me with that shit that you be doin'
You in it for the likes, I'm only in it for the music
Rock my hair bone straight in the name of Andre, Jiggy J
This cunt right here ain't come to play
Time to serve it up, I'm on a platter, flamb√©
Why the ones with no tact always got the most to say?
Makin' shit look easy so it's hard to read me
Switched up my punchlines, drop bars in Geechie
Tell 'em run it back, I'm in the mood for a repeat
Your eyes wide open and you still couldn't see me
[Chorus: Cakes da Killa]
Yo, he want a sip of my sip
He wanna slide
He tryna dip in the whip
Who get it crackin' like this? (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna grind
He got his hands on my hip (Yeah)
He want a sip of my sip
He wanna slide
I'm tryna dip on the dick (Yeah)
Who get it crackin' like this?
I'm bound to shine
He got his hands on my hip

[Bridge: Cakes da Killa]
I ain't never in the mood to be playin' no games
Fuck with no squares, chat with no lames
I don't save a lot of numbers, don't remember all the names
All these niggas all the same, tryna climb the food chain
I ain't never in the mood to be playin' no games
Fuck with no squares, chat with no lames
I don't save a lot of numbers, don't remember all the names
All these niggas all the same, tryna climb the food chain

[Verse 2: Sevndeep]
All these niggas all the same, wanna take my last name
But this ain't that kinda game, watch a nigga do his thing, yeah
It's Sevndeep, the top of the food chain
Addicted to fuckin' niggas, gettin' money, and the fame
They all jealous, they see me in Margielas
All these niggas is my bitches like my name is Cruella, yeah
He tryna fuck, but I ain't that kinda of fella
Told him we can talk about it after we go to the teller
Damn, Sevn, where this flow come from?
I told these niggas I'm the best, these other niggas is bums
I'm a full course meal, he ain't eatin' no crumbs
Duckin' and dodgin' like I'm Neo 'cause I'm really the one
Yeah, yeah, I really do this
Yeah, but you already knew this
When I'm in your city, all the niggas tryna get me
Cakes lookin' like a killer, told 'em, "Nigga, don't tempt me"
I got plenty and I ain't friendly (Yeah)
Six-feet-fine and my style compliment me (Yeah)
I start trends and then niggas be trendy
Servin' Lewinski, where the fuck is my Fendi?
Yeah, that's how you ride a beat
Just made in a day, but you make it two weeks, yeah
The maneater and I'm bringin' the heat
It's no Sade, but they ain't fuckin' with me, yeah

Yo, he want a sip of my sip
He wanna slide
He tryna dip in the whip
Who get it crackin' like this? (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna grind
He got his hands on my hip (Yeah)
He want a sip of my sip
He wanna slide
I'm tryna dip on the dick (Yeah)
Who get it crackin' like this?
I'm bound to shine
He got his hands on my hip

[Outro: Sevndeep]
Yeah, got his hands on my hip
Yeah, got his hands on my hipEmbed
