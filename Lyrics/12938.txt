Our Deal Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you leave me
The bed is empty
And I feel crazy
'Cause I didn't say anything

[Chorus]
I wish you would tell me
How you really feel
But you never tell me
'Cause that's not our deal
[Verse 2]
When you leave me
You take away everything
You take all my money
You take all my weed

[Chorus]
I wish you would tell me
How you really feel
But you never tell me
'Cause that's not our deal

I wish you would tell me
How you really feel
But you never tell me
'Cause that's not our deal

[Outro]
That's not your deal
That's not my deal
That's not your deal
That's not my deal
That's not your deal
That's not my deal
That's not your deal
That's not my deal
That's not your deal
That's not my deal
That's not your deal
That's not my dealYou might also like6Embed
