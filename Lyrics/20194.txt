​wait for you in the dark Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Live a better life, have a better time
I don't feel right, like a real knife when I feed it lies
Live a better life, have a better time
Know I need it, now you see that we all burn alive

[Verse 1]
Fuck, all of that shit, like
Punch out, yeah its quit time
New me, new you, who knew, fuck you I'd say for the fifth time
It's alright, tell me why we fight
Shoulda knew new you'd do all the same shit for the sixth time
[Chorus]
Read my mind
I'll wait for you in the dark
Read my mind
I'll wait for you to depart
Breathe in, breathe out
I'll breathe you out of my lungs
Bleeding, bleed out
I'll bleed you out of my heart

[Verse 2]
Yeah words struck me like some lightning
Yeah they numbed me like some Vicodin
Made me feel better like vitamins
This love is shallow, I'll dive in
Run away from all the ties, yeah
Say you lookin' like a light yeah
Baby, I don't know your mind, yeah
I don't know if I could fight, yeah
You're like a thief in the night, stole my heart
And youre so perfect to me, how it fell apart
Your eyes are like diamonds, they gleam even in the dark
Even in the dark
I hold on to the past and I can't let go
I hold on to this sadness, the hurt  just won't go
Hold out for me just for this one time
Hold on for me say you love me two times
I'll hold out for you
I won't ignore you
Pull up for me just for this one time
Hold on for me say you love me two times
I'll hold out for you
I won't ignore you
I'll hold out for you
You might also like[Chorus]
Read my mind
I'll wait for you in the dark
Read my mind
I'll wait for you to depart
Breathe in, breathe out
I'll breathe you out of my lungs
Bleeding, bleed out
I'll bleed you out of my heart

[Bridge]
I'm better without you
I'm better off on my own
I'm sorry I doubted you
I shoulda never listened at all
I'm better without you
I'm better off on my own
I'm sorry I doubted you
I shoulda never listened at all
I'm better without you
I'm better off on my own
I'm sorry I doubted you
I shoulda never listened at all
I'm better without you
I'm better off on my own
I'm sorry I doubted you
I shoulda never listened at all
[Chorus]
Read my mind
I'll wait for you in the dark
Read my mind
I'll wait for you to depart
Breathe in, breathe out
I'll breathe you out of my lungs
Bleeding, bleed out
I'll bleed you out of my heart1Embed
