If You Like It or Not Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody knows
And I've said it before
She takes off her clothes
Shakes me like I'm not shaken before

[Chorus 1]
Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give me a chance
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too
Hey
[Verse 2]
Try to shut your eyes
And this won't hurt one bit
See, I cannot tell a lie
You just might even like me to quit

[Chorus 1]
Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give a chance
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too

[Chorus 2]
You always get everything that you want
I can't explain, so I'll flaunt what you got
I'm yours and you're mine, if you like it or not
Oh-ho, oh-ho, I know, oh-ho hey!

[Chorus 1]
Oh my girl, oh my girl, just give me a chance
I don't want to explain, I just want to dance
On the graves, on the graves, of every girl
That I knew before you, that are dead to me too

[Chorus 2]
You always get everything that you want
I can't explain so I'll flaunt what you got
But I'm yours and you're mine, if you like it or not
Uh-oh, oh no! Oooh, it's so good! Oh-ho, Uh-oh, n' wha-ho! Oh!You might also like3Embed
