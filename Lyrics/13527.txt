Lions in the Wild Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking out for a new horizon
Reaching out, I can almost see the place
Holding on with a heart that's frozen
In the dark, but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

[Chorus]
We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me, this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
[Verse 2]
Looking out at the open skyline
Reaching out, I can almost touch the place
Where the lost ones find their freedom
In the dark, but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

[Chorus]
We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me, this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wildYou might also like1Embed
