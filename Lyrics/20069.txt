Dying Dog Lyrics[Hook]
My skin is burning off
They don’t wanna see my face around
Everybody hates my guts
I’m the meanest dying dog you'll ever find at the pound
My skin is burning off
They don’t wanna see my face around
Everybody hates my guts
I’m the meanest dying dog you'll ever find at the pound

[Verse]
Put your fingers in my cage I will bite you
My teeth sinking right through the bones that’s inside you
Look in my eyes you can feel I don’t like you
Leave me out to die on the road know you’d like to
Digging up dirt tryna find out my way back
Back when my form was a shade let me fade black
Do me your worst thing no problem i’ll take that
Just don’t cry when I feed the payback
[Hook]
My skin is burning off
They don’t wanna see my face around
Everybody hates my guts
I’m the meanest dying dog you'll ever find at the pound
My skin is burning off
They don’t wanna see my face around
Everybody hates my guts
I’m the meanest dying dog you'll ever find at the poundYou might also like2Embed
