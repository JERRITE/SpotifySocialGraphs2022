Cold Companion Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was born to love her
Everybody knows
Just the way it is, just the way it goes
She's a cold companion
Like a desert rose
The worse it is, the more she glows

[Chorus]
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?
[Verse 2]
I saw a light shining
On the edge of town
I packed my things and I ran it down
Pass me my hammer, I hold it in my hand
We can never change the universe's plan

[Chorus]
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?

[Chorus]
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?
Woman are you undone?You might also likeEmbed
