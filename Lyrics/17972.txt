No One Is Alone Lyrics[CINDERELLA]
Mother cannot guide you
Now you're on your own
Only me beside you
Still, you're not alone
No one is alone, truly
No one is alone

Sometimes people leave you
Halfway through the wood
Others may deceive you
You decide what's good
You decide alone
But no one is alone
[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
I wish...

[CINDERELLA, spoken]
I know...
(sung)
Mother isn't here now

[BAKER]
Wrong things, right things

[CINDERELLA]
Who knows what she'd say?

[BAKER]
Who can say what's true?

[CINDERELLA]
Nothing's quite so clear now

[BAKER]
Do things, fight things

[CINDERELLA]
Feel you've lost your way?
You might also like[BAKER]
You decide, but

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
You are not alone

[CINDERELLA]
Believe me
No one is alone

[BAKER]
No one is alone
Believe me

[CINDERELLA]
Truly...

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
You move just a finger
Say the slightest word
Something's bound to linger
Be heard

[BAKER]
No one acts alone
Careful, no one is alone
[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
People make mistakes

[BAKER]
Fathers

[CINDERELLA]
Mothers

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
People make mistakes
Holding to their own
Thinking they're alone

[CINDERELLA]
Honor their mistakes

[BAKER]
Fight for their mistakes—

[CINDERELLA]
Everybody makes—

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
One another's
Terrible mistakes

Witches can be right
Giants can be good
You decide what's right
You decide what's good

[CINDERELLA]
Just remember:

[BAKER]
Just remember:

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
Someone is on your side

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD & JACK]
Our side

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
Our side
Someone else is not
While we're seeing our side—

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD & JACK]
Our side—

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
Our side—

[BAKER, CINDERELLA, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD & JACK]
Maybe we forgot:
They are not alone
No one is alone

[CINDERELLA]
Hard to see the light now

[BAKER]
Just don't let it go

[BAKER & CINDERELLA]
Things will come out right now
We can make it so
Someone is on your side—
No one is alone
