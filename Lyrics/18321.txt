Wife Me Lyrics[Chorus: RAYE]
First base
I don't give it up until I'm first place
Boy, I know you want this in the worst way
No, now you better not waste my time
The only way you gon' get it is if you wife me babe, wife me babe

[Verse 1: RAYE]
If you were mine, make every day your birthday
On time whenever that you want me
All yours, all yours
I'd give my all to you if I know you'd never hurt me
Pick you up whenever you are working
Got your boy dem jealous when I walk in
Fill you up, fill your cup
You know I'ma be the drink for you if you feeling thirsty
[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Save it for you if you are true
Don't be no fool
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: RAYE]
First base
I don't give it up until I'm first place
Boy, I know you want this in the worst way
No, now you better not waste my time
The only way you gon' get it is if you wife me babe, wife me babe

[Verse 2: RAYE]
If I was yours, I'd never leave you hungry
24/7, when you need me, I'll be there babe
On time, on time for a 1-2-3-4 you don't gotta [?]
Believe that I know you wanna pin me down
That is even if you ever get to work out how
If you need it, boy you better make me believe it

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Save it for you if you are true
Don't be no fool
Ooh, ooh
