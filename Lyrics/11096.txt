Colors (Single Version) LyricsHow do you get along? What do you try for comfort?
How do you get it out in these streets, that smell of sulfur?
Well, color me green with envy, lavender streets aplenty
These colors, I swear, they're not enough

What are you on about? What did you engineer?
All those tears I cried, it's like they fell on your deaf ears, so
What do you want from us? What do you want from me?
I'm coming up darker on your black side of hypocrisy

Now we're just two people who don't know who we are anymore
I want to talk to you once before you're out that door
I'm sorry, you're sorry more
I've got this and you want no more
What do you think about it?
The kingdom's dead for days
Emerald towers and those golden roads go up in a haze
It's hard to tell you the truth, "I slept with someone else"
And looking you up and down, this is harder than I thought I fell

I'm coming up nicely, covered in rainbows
Or coming up roses, have I been here before?
I'm coming up nicely, covered in rainbows
Have I been here before?
What do you try for comfort?
I'm feeling like I'm in troubleYou might also likeEmbed
