Wynonaâ€™s Big Brown Beaver Lyrics[Intro]
2... (3,4)

[Verse 1]
Wynona's got herself a big brown beaver
And she shows him off to all her friends
One day, you know, that beaver tried to leave her
So she caged him up with cyclone fence
Along came Lou with the old baboon
And said, "Recognize that smell?
Smells like seven layers
That beaver eats Taco Bell."
[Verse 2]
Now Rex, he was a Texan out of New Orleans
And he traveled with the carnival shows
He ran bumper cars, sucked cheap cigars
And he candied up his nose.
He got wind of the big brown beaver
So he though he'd take himself a peek
But the beaver was quick
And he grabbed him by the kiwis
And he ain't pissed for a week
(And a half!)

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Now Wynona took her big brown beaver
And she stuck him up in the air
Said, "I sure do love this big brown beaver
And I wish I did have a pair."
Now the beaver once slept for seven days
And it gave us all an awful fright
So I tickled his chin, and I gave him a pinch
And the bastard tried to bite

[Outro]
Wynona loved her big brown beaver
And she stroked him all the time
She pricked her finger one day, and it occurred to her
She might have a porcupineYou might also like7Embed
