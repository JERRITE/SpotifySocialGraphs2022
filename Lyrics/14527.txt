RHODODENDRON LyricsRhododendron
Nightblooming jasmine
Deadly nightshade
Fox Glove renegade
Rhododendron
I can hear you speaking
You can feel me breathing
Break my head open

Morning glory
Naked boys
Limestone Everglade
P-p-police barricade
Rhododendron
Oh, I can't look back
I lost it all on
This one way track
Don't turn your back on the mainland
Don't turn your back on the mainland
Don't turn your back on the mainland
Rhododendron

Wake up in
A field of corn
Staring at a
Sky reborn
Spirit find me
Oh, spirit guide me
Addicted to the
High of violence

Full Moon Maple
Chamico perfume
Wrap your limbs around me
This won't be over soon

Don't turn your back on the mainland
Don't turn your back on the mainland
Don't turn your back on the mainland
Rhododendron

Everything I have is gone
I don't know what it'll take to carry on
Everything I hate is gone
I don't know what it'll take to carry on
(I don't know what it'll take to carry on)
(I don't know what it'll take to carry on)
(I don't know what it'll take to carry on)You might also likeEmbed
