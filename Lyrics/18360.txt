ILY (Interlude) Lyrics[Chorus: Young Adz]
Yeah, 'member when I used to take the bus down?
Now a nigga pull up, chain bussdown
Take a shot of lean, feel rushed now
Baby girl, I really wanna fuck now
Current whip, Mercedes Benz
Next whip gotta be a Porsche
Have you really got me 'til the end?
She just told me "Darling, of course"
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
That pussy so good, help me stay out of trouble
[Verse: Yxng Bane]
Pussy so good, so good, so good, so good
I tell you "I love you" when we lie, it's true
You take out the hood, make me behave so good
Yeah, I'm tryna- in you
You take me so damn high, sex on ice
Biting on my chains and your Carti' blings my [?]
I scream sex, fuck you with no condoms 'cause it's mine
It's just you yes, no more tick whenever you get upset

[Chorus: Young Adz, Yxng Bane & Both]
Yeah, 'member when I used to take the bus down? (Bus down)
Now a nigga pull up, chain bussdown (Bussdown)
Take a shot of lean, feel rushed now (Rushed now)
Baby girl, I really wanna fuck now
Current whip, Mercedes Benz (Benz)
Next whip gotta be a Porsche (Porsche)
Have you really got me 'til the end? (End)
She just told me "Darling, of course" (Oh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
That pussy so good, help me stay out of trouble

[Outro: Yxng Bane]
