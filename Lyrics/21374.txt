Whiskey Drinkinâ€™ Woman LyricsClose up the bar you know the gates of the brewery
She's out there every night
And she sure ain't drinkin' tea
I love that woman, she's the best one that I had
But she's got this habit now and it sure is gettin' bad

That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me

She's got bottles in the kitchen
Even got them in my bed
Most times I see her now
She's three parts out of her head
Don't know where I went wrong
I sure try to treat her right
But it sure upsets me
Seein' her juiced up every night

That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me

Help me solve this problem
Won't you help me find the key
The way that things are going
I'll have to buy the distillery

She just stands there smilin'
With a whiskey in each hand
Got to think of something
Don't know how much I can stand

That whiskey drinkin' woman
Is makin' a poor man out of me

Got to get myself together, start workin' something out
Maybe if I tried some booze, I'd know what it's about
I love that woman, she's the best one that I had
But she's got this habit now
And it sure is gettin' bad
