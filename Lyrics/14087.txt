Milk & Honey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Honey here we are
Dreaming in the dark
Trouble seems so far
Their thoughts were ours
But now we dream apart
Now we dream apart
Boiling water

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm just content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar
[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more and now it's all gone

[Verse 2]
Honey you're so kind
Oh we follow flight
You shook me up inside
You pick up every rumours in sight
But all the roses died
I'd rather keep them alive
Roots grow slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd be content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar

[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more
You just want more
You might also like[Bridge]
Honey I tried
To make it work
You're unsatisfied
You make it worse
Honey I'd die

[Chorus]
Still all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more
You just want more
You just want more
And now it's all gone4Embed
