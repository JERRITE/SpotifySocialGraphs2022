Tonight Belongs to You Lyrics[Verse 1: Drew Ramos, Chance Perez]
No, I never seen you here before
You look like someone that I wanna know, oh
Every move that your body makes, oh
Starts to pull me closer
Caught you lookin' right into my eyes
And there's a tension that we can't deny, oh
I want the worst every night and day, oh
More than I can take

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Conor]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' not to lose control
But I can't keep my hands off you anymore
Now, there's only one thing that I have to hear you say
[Chorus: Brady Tutton, All]
So tell me you want me, tell me you need me
The way I need you
I like how you move it, baby, I mean it
When I sing to you
Then right when you walked through the door
The night wasn't mine anymore
So tell me you want me, tell me you need me
'Cause baby, tonight belongs to you

[Verse 2: Sergio Calderon, Sergio Calderon and Chance Perez]
Don't wanna hear you say you gotta leave
But if you do, it better be with me, oh
If you want, we can run away, oh
Even change our names

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Conor, Michael Conor and Drew Ramos]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' not to lose control
But I can't keep my hands off you anymore
Now there's only one thing that I have to hear you say

[Chorus: Brady Tutton, Drew Ramos, Chance Perez]
So tell me you want me, tell me you need me
The way I need you (Need you)
I like how you move it, baby, I mean it
When I sing to you (When I sing to you)
Then right when you walked through the door
The night wasn't mine anymore
So tell me you want me, tell me you need me
'Cause baby, tonight belongs to you

'Cause baby, tonight belongs to you
'Cause baby, tonight belongs to you

[Pre-Chorus: Chance Perez]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' not to lose control
