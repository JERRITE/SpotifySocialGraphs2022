Sheepskin Tearaway LyricsShe opened her heart
To tearaway, (sheepskin tearaway)
Was covered with scars
And full of heroin
Everyone said from the start
Not one single thing, could ever be OK
She listened any way...

She just opened her heart
Threw her cares away
And how they held him so tight in the dark
He washed the heroin
She heard him say
All my life I've been fighting
And making the best of
And willing very bad luck, very bad luck, very... very bad luck
To the
Who you're fighting but nowhere
If nowhere's here with you
On my skin
And you can fight forever
But if you kill them all
You'll never win
So give me your surrender
There are other ways
To kill the pain
But things will never mend you
It's like trying to dry your eyes in the pouring rain

She opened her heart
To tearaway, (sheepskin tearaway)
All covered with scars
And full of heroin

Tearaway, sheepskin tearaway
Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
