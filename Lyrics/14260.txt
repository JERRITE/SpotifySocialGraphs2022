Happy Family Lyrics[Verse 1]
Left and right, they're calling me back home
And I've heard their cries
I've felt it in my bones

Left and right, they choke me tight
I'm overworn and out of sight
I've heard their cries
I've felt it in my bones

[Verse 2]
Been searching for a long time, in this town
We're looking for a goldmine
So we can get out
To find a place, or waste away
Another day that goes by
Another card, we know we should be grateful
But sometimes it's hard, we're so alone
But it's not for long

[Chorus]
Well maybe we were disavowed
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts forever
Time will always take its toll

And if a broken home is on the shelf
You know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role

[Verse 3]
Been dreaming of those bright lights, in the city
Waking with a cold fright
Oh what a pity, a bad nights sleep
The fourth this week
You're longing for a partner
To get you through, wishing that in time
You'll find someone to hold onto to

[Chorus]
But maybe we were disavowed
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts for ever
Time will always take its toll
You might also likeAnd if a broken home is on the shelf
You know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role

[Bridge]
Heavens have you seen
The news that's on the screen
It's all violence, heartbreak and misery

Heavens have you seen
What they have done to me
I'm a hollow shell from the grim 90's

[Chorus]
Maybe we were disavowed
Careful what you wish for now
Nothing lasts forever, time will always take its toll

And if a broken home is on the shelf
We know what we should ask ourselves
Were we ever happy acting in a family role?1Embed
