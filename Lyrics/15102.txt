Fritzâ€™s Corner Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not mad
I'm just bored
And everything I do is only because
There's nothing much else for me to do
And that includes you
And that includes you

[Refrain](x3)
Messing around with you
[Verse 2]
Piss away potential
Every day is a waste
And I'm wasted everyday
There's nothing much else for me to do
And that includes you
And that includes you

[Refrain](x3)

[Chorus]
You see me now a little bit clearer
The face I make when I'm looking in the mirror
It gives me away
The things that I say

You think you know where I'm coming from
The words I say when I'm playing dumb
It gives me away (x4)

[Verse 3]
One more thing before we go
I've stepped over everyone I know
Everyone, I know
Everyone, I know
You might also like[Chorus]

It gives me away

You think you know where I'm coming from
The words I say when I'm playing dumb
It gives me away (x3)
I'm always ashamed

[Outro](x8)
I'm always ashamed
And that's no way to beEmbed
