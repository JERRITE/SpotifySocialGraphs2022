Henrietta Lyrics[Verse 1]
Henrietta, we got no flowers for you
Just these three miserable cunts
Sitting on the back seat, tapping on the off beat
We know you love us and you probably do
Although your husband may cut us
He's an animal, though anything is possible

[Pre-Chorus]
Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us about
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola
[Chorus]
And it's, clean out the bank and bump off your daddy, you can
Come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts, these are
Crazy times down at Costello music, you can
Answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Dear Henrietta, we're just three lonely boys
Though the girls love us, we're so
Into you incredibly, we'd love to see you terribly
We'd love to hate ya, but we don't have no choice
Come be our wa-ha-ha-ha
Honey, three four, one time, once more

[Pre-Chorus]
Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us about
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola
You might also like[Chorus]
And it's, clean out the bank and bump off your daddy, you can
Come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts, these are
Crazy times down at Costello music, you can
Answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

[Bridge]
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow

[Chorus]
And it's, clean out the bank and bump off your daddy, you can
Come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts, these are
Crazy times down at Costello music, you can
Answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on
Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy, you can
Come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts, these are
Crazy times down at Costello music, you can
Answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

[Outro]
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
