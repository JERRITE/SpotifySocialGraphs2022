Come to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come to me
I'll take care of you
Protect you
Calm, calm down
You're exhausted
Come lie down
You don't have to explain
I understand

[Chorus]
You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm
[Verse 2]
Jump off
Your building's on fire
And I'll catch you
I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And then I'll nurse you
I'll nurse you
I'll protect you

[Chorus]
You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charmYou might also like32Embed
