63 Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now I'm packing to leave you for 63 days
And you think I won't miss you in six million ways
And the time of your life, spent wondering why
I don't call when I promise to
Ooh, in the doorway

[Chorus]
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe
[Verse 2]
Now I know what you need 'cause our fears are the same
If we shake down the pretense, it's all a parade
'Cause I'm still by your side
I'm still wondering why
I don't call when I promise to
Ooh, in the doorway

[Chorus]
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe

[Bridge]
With all the places that we go
And all the faces that we show
When you need me I'll be home

[Chorus]
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe
I told you I would race
Home when you need me
In for the long chase
I'll make you believe
You might also like[Outro]
I told you I would race
I told you I would race
I told you I would race
I told you I would race
Home when you need meEmbed
