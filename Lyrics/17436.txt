When We’re Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been to every bar in the street
So they could remember me
And they seen every bad side of me
Was escaping reality

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I found you and there's no way around you
Yeah every night, every day
And here’s to winning and ever overthinking
You better get out our way
[Chorus]
We're screaming out every word to our favourite song
Remember us when we're gone
Ain't looking back at the old days, the night's still young
Remember us when we're gone
Yeah when we're gone

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah when we're gone
Yeah when we're gone

[Verse 2]
And on every night we left to mark
So we'd never fall apart
I won't go back to that lonely heart
Every day's like a brand new start

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I found you and there's no way around you
Yeah every night, every day
And here’s to winning and ever overthinking
You better get out our way

[Chorus]
We're screaming out every word to our favourite song
Remember us when we're gone
Ain't looking back at the old days, the night's still young
Remember us when we're gone
Yeah when we're gone
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Yeah when we're gone
Yeah when we're gone1Embed
