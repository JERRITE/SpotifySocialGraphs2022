Make Us Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Underneath the Glasgow lights
The narrow streets are blue and white
They lead me to a place where I belong
And walking there I hear a sound
Of all the people loud and proud
Their voices come together in a song

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what may come
We'll always follow on
We'll always follow on
We've had our darkest days
Now is our time again
The writing's on the wall
[Chorus]
Now you've got giants at your feet
You'll hear the call of history
You gave us something to believе
We follow you, so make us dream
Now makе us dream
Now make us dream

[Verse 2]
We will travel far and wide
To fly the flag and fly it high
For all the ones we've lost along the way
To absent friends we'll raise a glass
And everything that's come to pass
Has paved the road to lead us to this day

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what may come
We'll always follow on
We'll always follow on
We've had our darkest days
Now is our time again
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
Now you've got giants at your feet
You'll hear the call of history
You gave us something to believe
We follow you, so make us dream
Now make us dream
Now make us dream
You might also like[Outro]
Now make us dreamEmbed
