Icey Lyrics[Intro]
CT Beats, Melii

[Chorus]
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy

[Verse 1]
I got the cash money
Make a rack, go and save, now these bitches is mad at me
What a catastrophe
Took a song, made it mine, labels they roundin' up stacks for me
I got the jack on me
Got 'em staring like I got the crack on me
Talkin' shit but it always get back to me
Makin' moves but you always in back of me
Come get your nigga, he tryna mack it to me like he tryna do me
Fiendin' for the cootie, rubbin' on the booty
Tú no eres na', tú no haces na'
Karma got you mad, bitch you doin' bad (you mad?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Tú me tienes tema
Cuida'o, si me tocas, te quemas, ah

[Chorus]
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy

[Verse 2]
I'm swimmin' in hella cash
Pops they be on me like gimme cash
I'm herbin' niggas you wish you had
Bitch I can't help that your pussy trash
Nana so cold, juicy, icy
We film a movie, I'm callin' him Spike Lee
He like the drip from my flow, he a Pisces
He think I'm wifey but he just a sidepiece
I be annoyed and he call it feisty

[Pre-Chorus]
Tú me tienes dema
Cuida'o, si me tocas, te quemas, ah

[Chorus]
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
Walk in the club, pop a bottle, cop a thug
These bitches don't like me, their baby daddy keep me icy
