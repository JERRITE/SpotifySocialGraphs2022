Canâ€™t Do It Without You (Duet) Lyrics[Verse: Austin Moon with Ally Dawson]
When the crowd wants more I bring on the thunder
Cause you got my back and I'm not going under
You're my point, you're my guard, you're the perfect chord
And I see our names together on every billboard

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Moon, Ally Dawson, both]
We're headed for the top, we got it on lock
We'll make 'em say hey
And we'll keep rockin'
Ohh
[Chorus: Austin Moon & Ally Dawson]
There's no way I could make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
It's no fun when you're doin' it solo
With you, it's like whoa
Yeah and I know
That I own this dream
Cause I got you with me
There's no way I could make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without youYou might also likeEmbed
