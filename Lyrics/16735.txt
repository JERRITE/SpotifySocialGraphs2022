Déjà Vu (I’ve Been Here Before) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm old, I'm rich and I'm poor
I feel like I've been on this earth many times before
Once I was a white gazelle, on horse back riding free
Searching in the darkness for a piece of me

[Hook]
I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
I can feel this for sure
For sure, for sure
I've been here before
[Verse 2]
I used to be a queen you know, on an island by the sea
With rainbow colored
People, happy as can be
We never had a problem, there never was a care
And
Love was ever flowing and its feeling shared

[Hook]
And I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
I can feel this for sure
For sure, for sure
For sure, for sure
I've been here before, yes I have
(I can feel it) I can feel it
(I can feel it) (I can feel it)
I can feel it, in my heart I feel it

[Verse 3]
The soul feels like the universe; it's vast and never ends
Stars to me are
The children, babies are my friends
God is like a galaxy, within my spirit
Flies
Felt this way a million times, please don't ask me why
You might also like[Hook]
The question of my lifetime; if you ask my point of view
They say it all was Karma, call it déjà vu
Call it déjà vu, call it déjà
Vu
Call it déjà vu, call it déjà vu
And I can feel this for sure
I've been here before
And I can feel
I've been here before
I've been here before
I can feel it

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]

[Hook]
And I can feel this for sure
For sure, for sure
For sure, for sure
I've been here before, I swear It
I can feel this for sure
I've been here before

[Outro]
If hate is on your mind
And you can't give love the time
If anger if your friend
Don't know when you die you'll come back again
And in the master's plan
You'll come back woman or man
If your life is
Full of sin
Don't you know when you die you'll come back again
I thank God, thank God, I thank God
I am not coming back no more
I've been here before
I don't want to come back no more
Thank God, thank God, thank God1Embed
