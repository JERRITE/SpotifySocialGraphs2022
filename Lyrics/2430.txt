You’re a Jerk Lyrics[Intro: Legacy]
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (New Boyz), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (New Boyz), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (New Boyz), you're a jerk
You're a jerk (New Boyz), you're a jerk
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
[Verse 1: Legacy]
Jerk, I'm so cocky with it
I got my eye shut closed like Rocky hit it
Got your girl on my swag she lovin' them jerkin' songs
Like the new iPod, just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin', in the waist I'm beatin'
Done, I got on my way, I'm leavin'
She like, "Where you goin'? I ain't got my shoes and purse"
I said, "It's none of your concern," and she yelled, "You're a jerk"
So I walked out the door, called Ben J. 
Told him it's a function, he said, "I'm on my way"
We pulled up to the party, I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, everybody jerkin'
We was jerkin' to the right, jerkin' to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like, "For real, jerk, you left me for this stuff?"
And the whole party heard her, but all I could hear was

[Chorus: Legacy & Ben J.]
"Wah, wah, wah-wah-wah" (You're a jerk)
Why you trippin'? I ain't even do nothin' (You're a jerk)
I'm a jerk? You ain't never lie
But, ayy, do me a favor, call me jerk one more time
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (I know)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (Ayy, ayy)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (I know)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (Ayy, ayy)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky, ha-ha)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)

Everything quiet and the bass real hard
And I stay geeked up, never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y'all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I'm a beast, I'm a king, and I guess I'm a jerk
And I go through big problems 'cause your boy here a flirt
Man, you call me a bother with ya lil' jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin', I'm squeezin', but your style is wack
Why you comin' to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin' her lil' stuff
While she textin' on the phone, Ben J. hit it rough
So I did, it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like, "Where you goin'?" There's another girl next
She screamed out loud, "Ben J., you're a jerk"
And I had nothin' to say but, "Sorry that it hurts"

[Chorus: Legacy]
"Wah, wah, wah-wah-wah" (You're a jerk)
Why you trippin'? I ain't even do nothin' (You're a jerk)
I'm a jerk? You ain't never lie
But, ayy, do me a favor, call me jerk one more time
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (I know)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (Ayy, ayy)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (I know)
You're a jerk (I know), you're a jerk (Ayy, ayy)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky, ha-ha)
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk (Jerky)
[Interlude]
Hey, brodie (Yeah, what up bro?)
All this jerkin' got me kinda feelin' geeked up (Oh for real?)
Yeah, dawg, I think you need to chop somethin' up
(Aight, for sure, hold up)

[Outro: Legacy]
You're a jerk, you're a jerk (Yeah, like this)
You're a jerk, you're a jerk (Aight, ayo, bro, what up?)
You're a jerk, you're a jerk (Ayy, man, what you want me to do now?)
You're a jerk, you're a jerk (Man, don't even trip, I got it)
You're a jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerked up8Embed
