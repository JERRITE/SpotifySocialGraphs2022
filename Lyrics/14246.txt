Thereâ€™s a Reason Why (I Never Returned Your Calls) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna know
Since you've been gone
Have I been on
Your mind?
'Cause I know I was for a while

Late last night
I saw you out
For a moment I
Turned to stone
'Cause there's still something only we see
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't talk
I'd have run to kiss your mouth
Is it me or
Just a dream that never dies?

[Chorus]
There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again

[Verse 2]
We're leaving here
We're on the run
The time has come
I don't hear no alarms
Fall asleep in my arms

A lover's game
Is never fair
But I still care
And I know you do too
'Cause there's a part of me that's you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't talk
I'd have run to kiss your mouth
Is it me or
Just a dream that never dies?

[Chorus]
There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again

[Bridge]
I still find parts of you
In the corners of my bedroom
Someday comes too soon
The radio plays our favourite tune again

[Chorus]
There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again2Embed
