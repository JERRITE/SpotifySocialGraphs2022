One Less Day (Dying Young) Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

[Verse 1]
I see my life like a train with a one-way track
I've made mistakes, and I couldn't take 'em back
And I've been runnin' 'round in circles 'til I'm dizzy, I can't lie
But every night I go to sleep's a day that I survive
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

[Verse 2]
And I've seen my friends fall away before their time
And I've been afraid that I may follow in their light
So I drink and love and whisper all the things I know are right
Someday, I will leave this world, but maybe not tonight

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm one less day from dying young (Yeah)

[Bridge]
All my life I have been wandering
Burning up my candle like my time just won't end
And I'll keep burning 'til there's nothing left
Praying that tomorrow I can do it all again
And if I get tomorrow, I will do it all again
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
Hey

[Outro]
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm one less day from dying young2Embed
