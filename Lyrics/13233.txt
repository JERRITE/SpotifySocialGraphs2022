​talk abt Lyrics[Verse]
I wake up on a Friday and I know that he's gone

I just need somewhere warm I can curl up
Just to rest my head
I just need someone that I can screw up
Like his cigarettes
He called me prophetic but I'm a fuck up
Call me that instead
I'm posting this bullshit so he’ll know I'm up
But he’s with his friends
[Chorus]
He’s all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he's all I talk about

[Verse]
I sleep in on the weekend cause he’s not in my dawn

I just need someone that I can shut out
Just to get ahead
I just need something that I can hear out
Just so it's misread
He called me electric but I'm a black out
Call me that instead
I'd cling like a leech if he'd put his arm out
Till I'm in his head

[Chorus]
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he’s all I talk about
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Talk abt
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouthYou might also like1Embed
