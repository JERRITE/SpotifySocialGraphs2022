Show Us Some Lyrics[Chorus: Lil Reese & Young Dolph]
All this money around this bitch, man, I had to get me something
Say you go do something to me man, then you gotta show me something
Ain't talkin', I ain't stuntin', in New Orleans ridin' with a hundred
You can get it however you want it, anytime anyplace how you want it
I don't rest, to the money I be runnin'
Straight get to the money, I be on it
I don't rest, to the money I be runnin'
Straight get to the money, I be on it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Young Dolph]
Lean when I wake up (Dirty)
Fiend for that paper (I need it)
Gettin' it now and later (Ms)
Smoke the best flavor (It's Dolph)
Trap in Designer lace-ups (Gabbana)
Rockin' Front$treet flackers (Rocks)
Ice gang major (Ice)
Fuck a major label (Fuck nigga)
Suckin' dick for a check, you should be ashamed (Fuck nigga)
Pillow talkin' with a bitch, fuck nigga, you lame (Fuck nigga)
Niggas start rappin', then jumped in the dope game (Ass backwards)
I was born in a pot of cocaine (Damn)
Drugs, money, violence, it run through my veins (Damn)
In the section 8, my favorite spot to hang (Yuh)
Oh, you a street nigga too, but we are not the same (Nah)
30 on me and I got a good aim
[Chorus: Lil Reese]
All this money around this bitch, man I had to get me something
Say you go do something to me man, then you gotta show me something
Ain't talkin', I ain't stuntin', in New Orleans wearin' with a hundred
You can get it however you want it, anytime anyplace how you want it
I don't rest, to the money I be runnin'
Straight get to the money, I be on it
I don't rest, to the money I be runnin'
Straight get to the money, I be on itYou might also like4Embed
