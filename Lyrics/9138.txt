Love Machine Lyrics[Verse 1: Nadine (with Kimberley)]
Ladies you're damn right
You can't read a man's mind
We're living in two tribes
And heading for war
Nobody's perfect
We all gotta work it
But fellas we're worth it
So don't break the law

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah, Cheryl, Kimberley, Nicola & Nadine]
You're call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about the limo for as long as I take
Next time read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go Eskimo, out into the blue
[Bridge: Nadine & Nicola]
Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie

[Chorus: All]
I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day, 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say, this time?

[Verse 2: Nadine, Nicola & Kimberley]
I've been going crazy while you sleep
Searching for a language that the two of us can speak
So mister prehistoric make your wheel
And I'll breathe underwater cos I like the way it feels

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah, Cheryl, Kimberley, Nicola & Nadine]
You're call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about the limo for as long as I take
Next time read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go Eskimo, out into the blue
You might also like[Bridge: Nadine & Kimberley and Nicola]
Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie

[Chorus: All]
I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day, 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say, this time?

[Post-Chorus: Nadine and Cheryl, Sarah & Nicola]
Oh, It's very new
Can anybody tell me what to do?
This feeling's very strange
Can anybody tell me what's your game?
A little education
To give you motivation
We turn the situation, round
Cos I don't wanna change you
Making you a stranger
I only rearrange you, for now

[Outro: Nadine & Nicola]
I'm just a love machine
(To give you a motivation)
I'm just a love machine
I'm just a love machine
(To give you motivation)
I'm just a love machine1Embed
