Burn It All LyricsPop a bottle for the girl with no boyfriend
Drink it all we don't care we just order more in
Light a blunt for the team cause we all here
Take a hit and make a hit
Nigga this is our year

In the game like a playbook
Zonin' out no idea where we're going
One day we will figure out
Everything was meant to be don't trip
It's only bitter now
Life is just a bitch but don't you worry I will sit her down
Tell her bring the ketchup, these weenies need a dressing
I a'int worried 'bout your hustle boy
Why you keep on pressing?
Let me live, let me live
Cause I will die if I dont sip
And drink my dreams a little bit
A little more, a little this, ahh

She's the reason you just up here at the show right?
And bring your girl homie she can stay the whole night
If this is the good life I'm aiming for a better one
You're shooting for the stars boy
You're gonna need a better gun

Cause tonight homie we don't give a shit man
Ask your girl friend can I be your girl's friend?
Go, go, drink it all and then some
We gon' burn it all don't worry 'bout your income
Cause tonight homie we don't give a shit man
Ask your girl friend can I be your girl's friend?
Go, go, drink it all and then some
We gon' burn it all don't worry 'bout your income

Over here we only really party with the baddest
And with you is when she turns into an actress
Showin' up you know what?
We gon' do this damn thing
Roll it up, smoke it up, it's pulling like a hamstring
You might also likeCrewnecks, snapbacks, Nixons on my wrist man
I am not a hipster sister I just do some hip things
Every night is minus Christ
Boy I pray to God and I did not sell my soul
I just gave him all we got

See this jager got a biddy
Better tell her 'bout my city
And that diddy shit we smoke
I'll puff a cloud of something biggie

I'm 20 years young
Livin' reckless with my friends
And if you forgot your wallet
Just tell Ralph he's got the spends

Waiting for that night, yeah I think about it all
It's a red carpet moment when these lights begin to call
Me and my girl chilling smiling with the pros
We're just looking at the camera hopin' everybody shows up

Cause tonight homie we don't give a shit man
Ask your girl friend can I be your girl's friend?
Go, go, drink it all and then some
We gon' burn it all don't worry 'bout your income
Cause tonight homie we don't give a shit man
Ask your girl friend can I be your girl's friend?
Go, go, drink it all and then some
We gon' burn it all don't worry 'bout your income
Cause tonight homie we don't give a shit man
Ask your girl friend can I be your girl's friend?
Go, go, drink it all and then some
We gon' burn it all don't worry 'bout your income1Embed
