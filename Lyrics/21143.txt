Iâ€™m a Fool Lyrics[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prison
You can tell I'm living, right?
[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool (Never said I'm livin' right)
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: J. Cole]

Boy you a fool

Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is the tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it, damn!
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me, "Cole, I love you, rode with you before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothers niggas, pardon if I crossed a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her, "Please don't put me on a pedestal
'Cause I know better and I'm still a fool"

Such a fool
For you
