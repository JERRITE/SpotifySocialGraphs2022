[Intro]
CashMoneyAP
Always pourin' up the Act' and I don't know how to act
Run up on me, you get clapped (Nooo')
Run up on me, you get clapped
Bitch you don't know how to act (Like in math class)
Pull up with my next while thinking bout' my ex
Yeah, oh
[Chorus]
Pull up with my next but I'm fucking on my ex
And I'm best dressed with Givenchy on my chest
Pull up got a Tec, I'ma put it to your neck
I'ma leave whats on your neck, got your bitch she giving neck
Pull up to the trap with my niggas in the back
And I got the strap, niggas don't know how to act
I'ma take his bitch, give her back, that's a fact
I'ma take his bitch, but she don't know how to act
So I don't know how to act

[Verse 1]
Hop up in that steamer and I don't know how to act
I just got a beamer and I don't know how to act
Run up on me, that's okay you know I got my MAC
Niggas talking dumb until I pull up with a mag
Ksubi jeans sag
Balmain boy, run up on me got a bag, yeah
Rich nigga shit (Ayy)
Rich nigga bitch
Niggas talking dumb, I get you offed quick
Broski got a .40, that's a different story
You listen to me when I'm talking, that shit mandatory
And all these niggas is my sons, I think I need Maury (Ayy)
Run up that's okay, it get a little gory (Ay)
Pull up in that drop-top with my next
I'm too busy flexing on my ex to care about my next
I just found out 'bout my ex (Just found out 'bout my ex)

Pull up with my next but I'm fucking on my ex
And I'm best dressed with Givenchy on my chest
Pull up got a Tec, I'ma put it to your neck
I'ma leave what's on your neck, got your bitch she giving neck
Pull up to the trap with my niggas in the back
And I got the strap, niggas don't know how to act
I'ma take his bitch, give her back, that's a fact
I'ma take his bitch but she don't know how to act
So I don't know how to act

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm back, that's a fact
Got your mom doing crack
I was whipping in the trap so I don't know how to act
Balmain on my jeans with the Raf Simmons matched
And I got Goyard on my waist, it's a trap
I'm trapped in designer, coolin' in the trap
Glocky's at your life
Talking stupid, you get clapped
Make you run a lap
I'ma shake up with my nig...

[Chorus]
Pull up with my next but I'm fucking on my ex
And I'm best dressed with Givenchy on my chest
Pull up got a Tec, I'ma put it to your neck
I'ma leave what's on your neck, got your bitch she giving neck
Pull up to the trap with my niggas in the back
And I got the strap, niggas don't know how to act
I'ma take his bitch, give her back, that's a fact
I'ma take his bitch but she don't know how to act
So I don't know how to act1Embed
