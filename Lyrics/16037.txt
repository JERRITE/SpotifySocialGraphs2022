Too Cool Lyrics[Intro: Tay Muletti]
I'm too cool
Tell yo' girlfriend what it do
Walk up on her like

[Verse 1: Tay Muletti]
I'm cool as ice
Girl fuck yo' guy
I'm twice as nice
Do what I want, buy what I want
Cus' this my life
Miss me with the bs' cus' I'm just too cool to fight
Touch her life a DS
Since it's me no she won't mind
If she brown skin and [?]
Then that's my type
I'm too cool got my shirt on in the pool
He so chubby, girl's say yummy who that dude (Muletti)
Just a cool youngin' from the south it's in my roots
Wit' a cool crew, we throwing' big four's out the roof
And I'm too cool, I sip syrup, don't got a cold
Just too cool to switch up, can't break the code
I'm wit' my niggas or I ride wit' my [?] ([?])
My bros blow stank, it make you cover your nostrols' (That Skunk)
[Hook: Tay Muletti, Jay Lee, & Dee Byrd]
I'm too cool

I'm too cool, you stand round' me get the flu (Back Back)
I'm too cool

I'm too cool to stand round' me who are you
I'm too cool for these dudes (You wack)
I'm way too cool for you
I'm too cool for these dudes, I'm way too cool for you
I'm too cool for these dudes
I'm just too cool for rules
I was way too cool for school
Does that make me a fool (I'm too damn cool)

[Verse 2: Dee Byrd]
Oooh' I'm just too cool (I'm just too cool)
It's burger man, baby you know what it do (What it do)
I rock short shorts because they go well wit' my shoes (They do)
Don't smoke or drink but I be geekin' wit' my crew (Yessir)
I'm your girl dreams, I'm just one guy you cannot lose (Yes I Am)
I fuck wit' studs, but really fuck wit' hoops (I fuck wit' hoops)
Don't dap me up just waddup, hello, how are you (Please don't touch me)
Hoe I got guala, bitch I'm breaded like a jew (Money Money)
This dick retarded, hit you once and you gon' drool (errrrr)
Hold on let me speak up on some stuff
Man I got model twitter girls and even ducks on my nuts
It come wit' niggas hating too, man that's enough on my nuts
It make me wanna' do it more, I won't let up on this stuff

[Verse 3: Nick Gee]
I'm too cool
First plan, I take your gal, I'm a fool (I'm a fool)
Plan B, I did not pull out, she got juice (She got juice)
Could not help it, her shit splashy like a pool (It's so wet)
Number one rule, Ima' stunt wit' my crew (Wit' the gang)
We taking pictures, they takin' pics, nigga what's new (Nothin')
I'm high you see, call me Hi-C, I got the juice (I got the juice)
I'm cool like aye keep getting, do what you do (Gang)
Just watch these J's, more minute maid, I got the juice
Tell me what flavor
I cannot date her
Nigga you paid her
That is not player
I damn near engraved her
You really forgave her
I bust in the gator
She touchin' her ankles
I'm countin my paper
My block is a igloo
My neck is a glacier
My cock is her make-up
I give her a facial
Look at my taper
I ball like a laker (Bitch I'm too cool)

[Verse 4: Jay Lee]
I'm way cooler than ya'll
Nigga mad at me cus' his hoe sucked my balls
I wouldn't give a fuck, man I dicked the hoe off
I'm a split fast nigga wit' the gold in my mouth
Stain ass niggas, no I can't hang around
He roachin for the sweet, tell that boy to move around
Cool OG yeah I'm known in my town
Nigga check the deuce every time I come down
Smokin' on the loud, smellin' like a pound
I'm lickin' like a lick, but you won't take me down (Down)
Ima' start bustin', lay your ass on the ground (Ground)
Won't let down, and that I vow (Vow)
Bust your hoe down right after she vow
All in her mouth, got her knees on the towel
I'm done with her then I'm back to the route (Route)
How I get paper, man that I won't announce (Nounce')
But if you lookin' for the herb then I got it by the ounce
Money jumpin' up, tryna make that shit bounce
[?]
Tryna have a good time wit' [?]
Lil' Dev wit me he'll take your ass down (Down)
Coolest nigga in this bitch, man I deserve a crown (Crown)
Sippin' on the lean or I'm sippin' on the crown (Crown)
Big backwood you know a nigga smoke the power (Pow)
