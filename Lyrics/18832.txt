Fever Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sinking into my awareness
Realizing what’s been done
I’ve taken a life and mine for granted
Neither planned or in passion
Riddled with guilt and crazy panic
My body tells my mind to run
Into the forest, towards the mother
Though I’ve destroyed her favorite son

[Refrain]
All the things I should have done
All the things I should have done
[Verse 2]
Execution style in the courtyard
Where everyone awake can witness
The cowardly shot into the temple
All because I lost my temper
Burn the evidence, flee the scene
Always keep those fingers clean
Devil eyes stare into mine
Say there is no place I can hide

[Bridge]
Now I must compare the consequence
End my life or just confess
I won’t last one minute in confinement
Either way I’m going to hell

[Refrain]
All the things I should’ve done, oh, oh, oh
All the things I should've done, oh, oh, oh
Either way I’m going to hell
Either way I’m going to hell

[Bridge 2]
All my life
Passing, before my eyes, all the time
I was awake (I was awake)
I was awake (I was awake)
I was awake all the time
You were alive and just arriving
I couldn’t see your eyes
All that is love is ever lasting
I didn’t realize

I was awake (I was awake)
I was awake (I was awake)
I was awake all the time
I was awake
I was awake
I was awake
I was awakeEmbed
