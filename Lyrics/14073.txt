Phonograph Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's 12:15 and I'm still in pajamas
I got shit to do but I don't really wanna
And I'm just now eating breakfast, is that bad? I hope not
For once all I wanna do is not focus on that
Should brush my teeth, didn't wanna scare away the loneliness, but
Maybe it left when it when it realized I hadn't showered in
Twenty-four hours, enough time for an epiphany
I realize the demons that I'm hiding from, they live with me

[Chorus]
There's a black hole
Where my heart used to lay
In my chest, beaten to death
All that's left is a phonograph
Playin' music that could be
The theme to a movie that no one ever sees
Hey!

Woah-oah-oah-oah
Woah-oah-oah-oah
Woah-oah-oah-oah-oah

[Verse 2]
It's been a new year now for twenty-two days
The honest truth is one lie we never say
I haven't done anything I promised I would do
I didn't make my resolutions because, really, what's the use?
One month down, eleven more to go
I don't wanna waste away, but they have prepared the tombstone
So grab me up, preserve my skin and bone while I
Take a vacation to understand my soul

[Chorus]
There's a black hole
Where my heart used to play
With the monsters, I must've scared them away
All that's left is an old phonograph
Playin' memories
I forgot that I had

Hey!

Woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Woah-oah-oah-oah-oah-oah

[Outro]
I prefer loneliness over
Sympathetic phoniness
To jog your memory
Who's running your mind?Embed
