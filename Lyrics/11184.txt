(Till I) Run with You LyricsLove's a surprise to me
Brings out the highs in me
That's not the way it used to be
I used to be blue
Then you showed me that love was near
And that's all I had to hear
I can't believe that dreams come true
'Til I run with you

Now, I can't sleep at night
'Til I run with you
'Til I do nothin' will be right
I'm goin' downtown takin' in a look or two
'Til I run with you
What else can I do?
You came one lonely day (You know, you came one lonely day)
It took me another way (Took me another way)
I'd pack up my heart and run away (Run away)
But I got some things to do (Doo doo doo doo)
I'll have to wait another day
'Til I run with you

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Nothin' will be right
'Til I run with you
Until I run with you

Nothin' will be right ('Til I run with you)
I can't sleep at night ('Til I run with you)
Nothin' will be right ('Til I run with you)
I can't sleep at night ('Til I run with you)
Nothin' will be right ('Til I run with you)
I can't sleep at night ('Til I run with you)
Nothin' gonna be right '(Til I run with you)
I can't sleep at nightYou might also likeEmbed
