Did I Make You Up? Lyrics[Intro]
Lost in a daydream

[Chorus]
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real? Did I make you up?

[Verse]
Was I wrong?
Did I make you up?
All along
I've been wakin' up
You're clearly disconnected
So who am I connected to?
Some person you projected
Were you ever telling me the truth?
[Refrain]
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was na誰ve
Lost in a daydream

[Chorus]
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real? Did I make you up?

[Refrain]
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was na誰ve
Hit me all a sudden
Shorty, you saw it comin'
I was summer, you were fall
Maybe I was na誰ve (I'm na誰ve)
Lost in a daydream

[Chorus]
When you think you really know someone
And you're blinded by the summer sun
Fall in love with who they won't become
Was it ever real? Did I make you up?

Did I make you up? No
Did I make you into someone else, no
So in love with who you won't become
Were you ever real? Did I make you up?Embed
