Dreaming Of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that somewhere you are
Thinking of me too

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming about you and me
[Verse 2]
Wonder if you ever see me (See me)
And I wonder if you know I'm there (Am I there, am I?)
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?
I just wanna hold you close
But so far, all I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day (Wait for the day)
And the courage to say how much I love you
Yes, I do

[Chorus]
I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow ('Til tomorrow)
I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming about you and me

[Bridge]
Coraz칩n
I can't stop dreaming of you
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
I can't stop dreaming
C칩mo te necesito
I can't stop dreaming of you
Mi amor, c칩mo te extra침o

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe that you came up to me
And said, "I love you"
I love you too

[Chorus]
Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow ('Til tomorrow)
And for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
Dreaming with you, endlessly (Dreaming of you tonight)
With you tonight ('Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight)
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
I'll be dreaming of you tonight (Endlessly)
And I'll be holding you tight ('Til tomorrow)
Dreaming with you tonight (Endlessly)

[Outro]
Endlessly
