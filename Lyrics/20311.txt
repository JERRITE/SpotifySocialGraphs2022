Stars Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girls in their heels and a skinny pair of blue jeans
Boys in black pearl buttons looking just like Springsteen
Momma says, "Why you wanna play in a silly rock and roll band?"
Well, if you stood here Momma, I know you'd understand, yeah
It's the lights
It's the high
It's the roar of a crowd on a Friday night

[Chorus]
And everybody's screaming out yeah, yeah, yeah
And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
Get on your feet if it feels good
If it feels right
We're all stars tonight
So sing it out, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey! Hey!
[Verse 2]
Let's get a little rowdy, gonna party all night long
And boys sway with your girls when we play a little slow song
Put your hands in the air, shine a lighter or a cell phone
You better buy another round, we ain't going home now
On the floor
In the stands
Tonight, we're all in the band

[Chorus]
And everybody's screaming out yeah, yeah, yeah
And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
Get on your feet if it feels good
If it feels right
'Cause we're all stars tonight
So sing it out, yeah, yeah, yeah

And everybody's screaming out yeah, yeah, yeah
And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
And everybody's screaming out yeah, yeah, yeah
And everybody's singing out yeah, yeah, yeah
Get on your feet if it feels good (Feels good)
If it feels right (Feels right)
'Cause we're all stars tonight
So sing it out yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey! Hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey! Hey!
Oh yeahEmbed
