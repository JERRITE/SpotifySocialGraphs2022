Be Sweet Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell the men I'm coming
Tell them count the days
I can feel the night passing by like a mistake waiting for me
Caught up in my feelings
Overthink the truth
Fantasize you've left me behind and I'm turned back running for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better
[Chorus]
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
(Be sweet)
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believе in something

[Verse 2]
So come and get your woman (Comе and get your woman)
Pacify her rage (Pacify her rage)
Take the time to undo your lies, make it up once more with feeling
Recognize your mistakes and I'll let you back in
Realize not too late, loved you always

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better

[Chorus]
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
(Be sweet)
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
(Be sweet)
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in somethingYou might also like3Embed
