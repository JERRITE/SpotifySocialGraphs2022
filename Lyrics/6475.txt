Donâ€™t Sing the Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pour one out for me, let it soak beneath the streets
Tell my story, it sounds crazy but it's true
We had highs and we had lows
Where'd we go, nobody knows
You can sing for me but don't you sing the blues
Made mistakes when we were young
Can't say that we never had fun
All the drinks came free, the women came in twos
Those were good times my friends but all good things gotta end
You can sing for me but don't you sing the blues
[Chorus]
Don't sing the
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
Don't sing the
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
Don't sing the blues

[Verse 2]
Told me "keep your image clean, don't get drunk, don't cause a scene"
But I fucked around, got all of these tattoos
Yeah I walked a different path, but I never once looked back
You can sing for me but don't you sing the blues

[Chorus]
Don't sing the
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
Don't sing the
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
Don't sing the blues

[Verse 3]
Baby, I was ridiculous, young Icarus
I flew too close to the sun but when I reminisce
That wickedness, was the shit that kept me young
And every choice I made, I wouldn't trade
All that for anyone
So don't you cry, cry, cry for me
And don't sing the
You might also like[Chorus]
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
(Don't, don't, don't you sing the blues)
Don't sing the
Blues, blues, blues
Now don't you sing the blues
Don't sing the blues

[Bridge]
Don't, don't, don't you sing
Don't, don't, don't you sing
Don't, don't, don't you sing
The blues
Don't, don't, don't you sing
Don't, don't, don't you sing
Don't, don't, don't you sing
The blues

[Verse 4]
As I lie here in my grave all my sins have washed away
Let me tell you from a dead man's point of view
Live your life 'cause when it's done
You ain't got no other one
When they sing for you don't let them sing the blues1Embed
