Prophecy Fulfilled LyricsAre these the final days I heard about when I was 8?
Are people really just too blind to see?
These evil motherfuckers want to crush the human race
And all you stupid fuckers want to bleed

And I'm staring at a wasteland, there's nothing now
I can't believe, how fast it fell
Staring at a wasteland of fear and doubt
Becoming clear, there's no way out

No one's escaping now
We deserve this hell
No one's escaping now
Should have stood your ground
I will not bow
I will not bow

And now the timе has come they're forcing us to mеdicate
The state is coming from a place of love
These evil motherfuckers want to turn us into slaves
And no one's fighting cause we're all too dumb

And I'm staring at a wasteland, there's nothing now
I can't believe, how fast it fell
Staring at a wasteland of fear and doubt
Becoming clear, there's no way out

No one's escaping now
We deserve this hell
No one's escaping now
Should have stood your ground

I will not bow
I will not bow

I will not bow
Cast me down again
I will not bow
Throw that stone my friend
Throw that stone my friendYou might also likeEmbed
