Paper Habits Lyrics[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
And I swear to keep it cool like my summers was
Now my buzz hot like my winter be
But I don't need they company
I'm so far from misery, told her she gonna want me back
Never that we history; Twitter that
They can't believe I did her that
Shit on that, now I got a new chick who be sittin' back
Twisting up, shawty keep it real as fuck
And if I fall, I bet she pick me up
Peace and love back
So if you ever need me hit me up
Crispy Chucks; West Coast style nigga, Dickied up
But where I reside up in the South them niggas blickied up
I wasn't even with that bullshit but I had to get me one
Only live once; no bitch has ever held me down nigga
Or nigga ever held me up so get the fuck
Them niggas taking shots but I ain't ducking
Real shit I'm doing it cause I love it
Spitta told me bitches come around a dime a dozen
But we from a spot where pretty women act ugly so fuck it
[Hook]
Right back in it; right back at it
Trying to touch this paper, I swear I gotta have it
Like I never had it, right back at it
Addicted to this paper, I swear I gotta habit
Right back in it; right back at it
Trying to touch this paper, I swear I gotta have it
Like I never had it, right back at it
Addicted to this paper, I swear I gotta habit

[Verse 2: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Right back in it; right back at it
On point with the flow
You know Trade automatic
When it comes to this rap shit; I only do classics
When it comes to my paper; ain't no plan, I gotta have it
Stay up on my grind whether it's hustling or rapping
I'm stacking you lacking, been about racks
In fact I'm only slacking when I'm wearing Polo khakis
On top of the money like a dope boy mattress
Stay alive and high until I'm low in the casket
Kush scent on my clothes I ain't trying to hide the habit
This that Skywalker OG you can smell it through the plastic
Unflavored Raw papers, smoking doobies down to ashes
Champ like Cassius, keep a 40 cal
And some grams in the stashes
Grams mixed with hashes
Roll it never I pass it around
You know the kush in town
Soon as I touch down like Madden
You might also like[Hook]
Right back in it; right back at it
Trying to touch this paper, I swear I gotta have it
Like I never had it, right back at it
Addicted to this paper, I swear I gotta habit
Right back in it; right back at it
Trying to touch this paper, I swear I gotta have it
Like I never had it, right back at it
Addicted to this paper, I swear I gotta habit

[Outro: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Yeah, we Jet Set, nothing less, nigga
What you expect, nigga? Jet (?), nigga?
Yeah, straight up with Jet Life shit, nigga
We stay high dog...5Embed
