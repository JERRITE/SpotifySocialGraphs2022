Close (Brooks Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
Rising with each beat
That the music is bringing
We're all flames in the fire
That keeps burning
We're inviting the night in
Welcome, oh, my heart's so full
I'm devoting myself to the night
There's no motive
We're just listening, we're existing
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We stay where the music plays
Where the lights drop low, and the people's swaying

[Drop]

[Verse]
Rising with each beat

We're inviting thе night in
Welcome, oh, my heart's so full
I'm devoting myself to the night
There's no motive
We're just listening, we're existing

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We stay where the music plays
Where the lights drop low, and the people's swaying
