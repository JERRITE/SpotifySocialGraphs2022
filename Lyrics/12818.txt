So Alright, Cool, Whatever Lyrics[Verse 1]
After you leave, I'll be so alright, it's true
It's not like I've got something grand to say to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like, "You'll be the only ever one
Like the only ever ones who came before"
How could I ever be so dumb
To believe I'd be the one you would adore?

[Chorus]
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be barely hanging on!
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be barely hanging on!
I wanna be with you all of the time
I wanna be loved by you every night
I wanna be dancing, dreaming, bawling and weeping
Over you all of my life

[Verse 2]
Now your name makes all the life inside me shake
But I guess God wants us apart, for Heaven's sake

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But how could you ever really know?
If you never look, you don't know what you'll find
I've got an effervescent glow
If you show me all the dark parts of your mind

[Chorus]
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be barely hanging on!
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be barely hanging on!

I wanna be with you all of the time
I wanna be loved by you every night
I wanna be dancing, dreaming, bawling and weeping
Over you all of my life

I wanna be barely hanging on
When you make me lose control
I wanna be barely hanging on
When you make me lose control

I wanna be barely hanging on
When you make me lose control
I wanna be barely hanging on
When you make me lose control

[Outro]
I wanna be barely hanging on (Barely hanging on)
When you make me lose control
I wanna be barely hanging on (Barely hanging on)
When you make me lose control

I wanna be barely hanging on (Barely hanging on)
When you make me lose control
I wanna be barely hanging on (Barely hanging on)
When you make me lose control5Embed
