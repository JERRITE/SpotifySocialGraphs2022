Looking for Some Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look around a room that's filled with faces
Every tear a window to the soul
Like silent unsung symphonies
The wild and the wonderful mysteries
Masterpieces I will never know

[Chorus 1]
'Cause everybody's looking for some light
You know everybody's looking for
Some light
[Verse 2]
Oh, and when the world is weighing on your shoulder
When the sorrow's heavy on your soul
Carry on and sing it like a soldier
Saying, "Come on, come on
We're gonna make it home"

[Chorus 1]
'Cause everybody's looking for some light
You know everybody's looking for some light
So come on, come on
'Cause everybody's looking for
Some light

[Bridge]
And darkness blurs the vision
Like a veil before our eyes
That love alone is able
To divide

[Tag]
Oh, you know everybody's looking for some light
Yeah, you know everybody's looking for some light

[Chorus 2]
So come on, come on, sing it like a soldier
Come on, come on, you know it ain't over
Everybody's looking for some light
So come on, come on, sing it like a soldier
Come on, come on, you know it ain't over
Everybody's looking for some light
You know everybody's looking for some light
You know everybody's looking forYou might also like1Embed
