Ha Ha, Hee Hee LyricsHa ha! (ha ha)
Hee hee! (hee hee)
Wha wha what?
What is so funny?
Ooh, goodbye!
In the dark the rent is cheap
Imagine you see the grass in the park
Ha ha, hee hee, whoa whoa
Well well well well well

Tear up my number [2x]
And don't call
Waking me up
At 5:00 a.m
I like my dreaming
Send me a dime
Get well, good luck
Adios Pasadena!

Nothing to do
You be the genius in you
But who cares
(If you are blue)
If you're through or two
You'll never miss it
Ooh whoo (ooh whoo)
