Keep It To Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
â€™Cause sleepin' alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wonderin' if I'm sleepin'
You heard from your friends that I'm doin' okay
And you're thinkin' that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

[Chorus 1]
Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself
[Verse 2]
If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

[Chorus 1]
So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missin' me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate goin' home alone
'Cause you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Outro]
Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
