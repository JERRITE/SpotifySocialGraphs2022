Feva Las Vegas Lyrics[Intro: Dappy & Tulisa]
Uh, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Na, na, nai
It's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus: Dappy]
I-I-I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
These so-called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now-ow-ow, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothin', so come the fuck up off my life
[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yo, I live my life on stages (Yeah), Feva Las Vegas
Sylvester Stallonin' it, any chick, I'm bonin' it
I'm entrepreneurin' it, we do this all ourselves
From the productions to videos and everythin' else (Haha)
See the buzz that we created was rare
Two independent releases from "Better Not" to "I Swear"
But I presume it's the tune with the chair that caused the havoc
Got all of these labels talkin' 'bout who the first to grab it
About man tryna buy my publishin' for only eighty grand
I might look like a boy, but I got a mind of a man (Straight)
See the fuck game gives you a false high (Haha)
When you think you're speakin' to me, mate, you're fuckin' screamin' in my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Tulisa]
Success causes jealousy
It can turn your best friend into your enemy
All I know, I believe in what I do, I can live without you
You motherfuckers are tryna suck me dry

[Chorus: Dappy, Tulisa & Both]
I-I-I (Oh), I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
These so-called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now-ow-ow, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothin', so come the fuck up off my life (Oh)

Yo, yo, yo
I ain't lookin' to be another one-hit-wonder
Have one track in the charts, but then the fame don't last (Nah)
Man, we lookin' to sell units (Yeah)
So when you hear Pussy Cat Dolls (Woo) and G-Unit, you will say give N-Dubz music
Been performin' on stages ever since we were thirteen
There ain't no one gon' tell us that we ain't put the work in
I'm keen, bustin' my balls, talkin' like a fiend for this dream
N-Dubz is my team (Haha), we weren't an overnight thing
From PC's overloadin' (Yeah) to problems that we couldn't solve 'em (Nah)
One day before our mix was due, there's no goin' home
In twenty-four hours in the studs eatin' microwave foods
Gettin' pranks off these dudes, I can't be asked for these youths (Rah)

[Pre-Chorus: Tulisa]
Success causes jealousy
It can turn your best friend into your enemy
All I know, I believe in what I do, I can live without you (Yeah)
You motherfuckers are tryna suck me dry

[Chorus: Dappy, Tulisa & Both]
I-I-I (Ooh), I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
These so-called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now-ow-ow (Oh), they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothin', so come the fuck up off my life (Oh)
[Verse 3: Tulisa]
Let's take a look at the situation, at my life, where it's gone
Now everybody wants a piece of me (Of me)
Tryin' to claim a right to the person I've become
That so good perfect image that you see on your TV screen
That discusses the real T, that messed up shit you didn't see
And as for all the men who want a piece of the pie
You really think I don't know all the reasons I'm on your mind?
It takes more than cheap talk to win my heart
So tell me where the hell were you before all this shit got fucked up?

[Chorus: Dappy, Tulisa & Both]
I-I-I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
These so-called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now-ow-ow, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothin', so come the fuck up off my life (Oh)
I-I-I (Oh), I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
These so-called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now-ow-ow, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothin', so come the fuck up off my life (Oh)

[Outro: Dappy & Tulisa]
Uh, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Na, na, nai
It's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
