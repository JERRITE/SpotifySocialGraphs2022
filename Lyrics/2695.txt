Heart So Big Lyrics[Intro]
You got a heart so big, so big
Way too big for this world
And you got a smile so bright, so bright
That it shatters the night

[Verse 1]
And just like a candle
You light a fire inside of me, oh
Like an endangered species
I want to hide you away from all the evil things
[Chorus]
'Cause you got a heart so big, so big
Way too big for this world
And you got a smile so bright, so bright
That it shatters the night

[Verse 2]
Oh, the only moments
That I remember are the ones of you and me
Oh, you're an endangered species
I wanna hide you away from all the evil things

[Chorus]
'Cause you got a heart so big, so big
Way too big for this world
And you got a smile so bright, so bright
That it shatters the night (Woo, ooh)

[Bridge]
Whoa, I never felt this love
And I can't get enough
You're everything that's right with me
The moon and the sun
Oh, and I wanna tell everyone
Oh, I wanna tell everyone
I wouldn't change a thing about you even if I could
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You might also like[Chorus]
You got a heart so big, so big
Way too big for this world
And you got a smile so bright, so bright
That it shatters the night

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
And you got a smile so bright, so bright
That it shatters the nightEmbed
