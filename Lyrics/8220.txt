Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm swimming in your ocean
Give you all of my devotion like nobody, like nobody
You got me dripping in emotion
Imagination overflowing
With your body, with your body

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'd ride and I'd die for you
You know I got nothing to hide from you
You know I got space in my life for two, yeah, yeah
Got a lot of love but in constant fear
'Cause if I get hurt I don't think I'd heal
I need you to read me loud and clear, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
So can you kiss me like you're dying of thirst and I'm water?
So can you kiss me like my lips help you breathe underwater?
'Cause that's how bad I want you, bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need to be the lightning or the thunder
But I need to know you're really going under
So can you kiss me like you're diving in deep and I'm water? (I'm water)
'Cause that's how bad I want you, bad I want you (Bad I want you)

[Verse 2]
All these moments come in waves
And I get lost in you for days
Your arms around me, your arms around me
And I can't have a little taste
I'm obsessed with you, I'm crazed
How you got me, that's how you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'd ride and I'd die for you
You know I got nothing to hide from you
You know I got space in my life for two, yeah, yeah
Got a lot of love but in constant fear
'Cause if I get hurt I don't think I'd heal
I need you to read me loud and clear, yeah, yeah

So can you kiss me like you're dying of thirst and I'm water?
So can you kiss me like my lips help you breathe underwater?
'Cause that's how bad I want you, bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you
'Cause that's how bad I want you

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need to be the lightning or the thunder
But I need to know you're really going under
So can you kiss me like you're diving in deep and I'm water? (I'm water)
'Cause that's how bad I want you, bad I want you (Bad I want you)
Oh, how bad I want you, you know
'Cause that's how bad I want you, bad I want you (Bad I want you)
