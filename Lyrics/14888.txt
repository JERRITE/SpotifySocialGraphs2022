Wooden Jesus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan?
But I didn't know it was the holy land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand
I pray

[Chorus]
Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
[Verse 2]
Yeah, Porcelain Mary, her majesties pure
Looking for virgin territory
Coat-hanger halos that don't come cheap
From television shepherds with livin' room sheep
And I pray

[Chorus]
Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in

[Guitar Solo: Mike McCready]

[Bridge]
Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan?
But I didn't know it was the holy land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand

[Chorus]
Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
