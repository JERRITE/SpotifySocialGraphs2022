Two Tone Rebel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hop to it with the fluids
Study like a student who be fucking with them truants
(I never left!)
No pack but I still smell sewage
Catch me blowing on that loud like a motherfucking tuba (Like a motherfuckin' tuba!)
Like it's motherfucking Zumba
Robot drop top cut-throat mula (Cut-throat mula)
Hopped out that Uber
Brand-brand new shoes no newer (No newer)
Don't fuck with me I got that Two Tone Rebel shit stuck to me, uh!
And it's a luxury, fucking with these beats got me living comfortably, uh! (Comfortably!)
And what I provide is the soundtrack that proves that we went through this life
Never divide, always survive
(Okay folks, we have arrived)
[Chorus]
Yeah, jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But he don't seem like he'll be waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love
Two-one-fifth in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't even fuck a knuckle up

[Verse 2]
Roughly about the size of Shaq, I fire back
I fire first, the damage hurts
The chorus hits, the drums are sick
Got kids out in Dubai bangin' my old shit
The dude is home
The wheels are clean
The flow is mean
I been E-dubble since the days of between
And god damn, (What?) I'm about the Shoulder Lean
Like Young Dro and T.I
Ya, (Lock and loaded) ya
Drama, they like me (Uh)
Full-size don't psych me (Uh)
Pull up on eighteens and, yeah, they just like me (Ay)
V8 all in mine, my wheels and my rims shine
R/T go hard G, no question with wind chimes
Front for that sponsor, front for that front doe'
If they can each time, my horse would be front row
Fuck what they came for, I know what they came for
My name is E-Dubble and I am not made
Fuck plan B, I got a plan for it
I put my head down and I just ran for it
Couldn't see the pitfalls that I ran towards
Moving so fast I was coming out my airforce
Keep the shoes on, get your move on
Stop slippin', you been trippin' way too long
Both shoes on, new true song
Rings a bell? Well, it must be Two Tones, uh!

Jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But he don't seem like he'll be waking up-waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love-show me love
Two-one-fifth in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't
(Lock and loaded)

[Chorus]
Jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But he don't seem like he'll be waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love
Two-one-fifth in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't even fuck a knuckle up

[Chorus]
Jazzers on deck when I come through
No Five-O on my gumshoe
We got more kicks than a kung-fu
Flick fuckboy might get it when he come to
But-but-but-but he don't seem like he'll be waking up-waking up
Most slept on him, fuck it, cousin, show me love-show me love
Two-one-fifth in my veins don't get it fucked
Run up on me wrong, I won't
