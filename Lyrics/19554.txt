Remember Me For Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't ever hold my breath
Sick of runnin' from my stress
Another tune that don't get used
Find my way with rusty clues
It's okay to walk that line
It's not okay to not be fine
Fear can make you run and hide
But it won't tell what's on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I sorta lie when I give advice
So I act like I'm not here
But I gotta shine like my daughter's eyes
When the hardest times get near
No matter how mixed up I get
I always seem to fit right here
So I always come right back to you and sing
[Chorus]
Days go by
But you're still minе
Time runs dry
But our stars still shine
And I don't wanna run from things that I can trust
You gon' remеmber me for me and, yes, that is good enough
I don't wanna leave before it's time for us
'Cause my only fear's not stayin' long enough to show my love

[Post-Chorus: Lily Moore]
(Ah)
(Ah)

[Verse 2: Lily Moore]
You know I just can't stay away
Try to make my heart behave
For the first time in my life
Wanna feel it all tonight
I have felt the cold, believe me
I won't ever go down easy
And I've said some hard goodbyes
But I do it in my own time

[Pre-Chorus: Lily Moore]
Yeah, I sorta lie when I give advice
And I act like I'm not here
But I gotta shine for my future self, my dear

Days go by
But you're still mine
Time runs dry
But our stars still shine
And I don't wanna run from things that I can trust
You gon' remember me for me and, yes, that is good enough (That is good enough)
I don't wanna leave before it's time for us
'Cause my only fear's not stayin' long enough to show my love

[Post-Chorus: Lily Moore, SonReal, Both]
For you
For you, for you, for you (You)
For you
My only fear's not stayin' long enough to show my love (You)Embed
