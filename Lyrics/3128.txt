All By My Lonely Lyrics[Intro: Lil Keed]
Got it on smash
Nah, real nigga shit, know what I'm sayin?
Mario!
It's all myself about you
Ohh, ohh
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Hop in the coupe, hop in the coupe
I'm going fast
I'm rockin' these shows, not standin' these hoes
Not goin' out sad
This for my bros, who been here all along
I got your back
I dip out there all by my lonely, I don't need no nigga
I spaz
Oh yeah, this a new bankroll
Oh yeah, talkin' bout the shit you can't fold
Oh yeah, I'm standin' ten toes
Oh yeah, and I'ma keep my pole
[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
I'll never let you go back to what you're used to
Tryna show you somethin' different but you didn't have no clue
You can have her back bro, yeah, I been smashed, ooh ooh
It wasn't what I thought it was, yeah, I had to tell the truth
Just 'cause I'm in that Bentley
Don't think I won't shoot out in broad day
Say Conley money be the best money
Got trap houses out the four way
And I ain't never been a scared nigga
All my young nigga wildin'
And all I hang around is dreadheads
Platted up like rastas
Montana shootin' at your damn head
Yeah real top shotta
He handle his business and go to bed
He ain't even think about you
Diamonds on ya toes and all baby
Love the way they look on ya
That pussy might not be talkin' bout nothin'
But you got some good lips on you
We slime 'em out, gotta slime 'em all the way can't even leave nothin'
I'm with Crips but I'm bleeding
I'm posted on 250 Bleveland
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Hop in the coupe, hop in the coupe
I'm going fast
I'm rockin' these shows, not standin' these hoes
Not goin' out sad
This for my bros, who been here all along
I got your back
I dip out there all by my lonely, I don't need no nigga
I spaz
Oh yeah, this a new bankroll
Oh yeah, talkin' bout the shit you can't fold
Oh yeah, I'm standin' ten toes
Oh yeah, and I'ma keep my pole

[Verse 2: Yung Mal]
I'ma keep my pole
I'ma stand ten toes
Gotta ride with my bros
Just like a junkie we want smoke
I done seen niggas act hard and fold
Watch these niggas go out sad for these hoes
The same ho fucked the gang and they gold
Young nigga cold, never let go
I done had me some long nights on that road
Trappin' hard, talkin' bout range
Cleveland the snow, gotta go hard
Get a bankroll, play yo' card
Nigga be bold, seen so much shit that I never told
Yeah this shit gettin' hard but I never fold
32 shots in the Glock when I pop and I make them get low
Bitch ain't crazy yeah she know who got them low
I'm with Lil Keed, Hood Baby wipe your nose
Pockets stay on swoll, haters fall like dominoes
I don't fuck around no no, I have young niggas at your front door
I'm in a brand new coupe this shit so fast
Gotta bag, can't look back
Niggas is mad, I just laugh
I bust down with the hood, don't crash
I bust down my wrist, just dance
Droppin' the top on the coupe, blowin' this cash
Just like a fan
[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Hop in the coupe, hop in the coupe
I'm going fast
I'm rockin' these shows, not standin' these hoes
Not goin' out sad
This for my bros, who been here all along
I got your back
I dip out there all by my lonely, I don't need no nigga
I spaz
Oh yeah, this a new bankroll
Oh yeah, talkin' bout the shit you can't fold
Oh yeah, I'm standin' ten toes
Oh yeah, and I'ma keep my pole4Embed
