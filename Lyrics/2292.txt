A Day At A Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Gentle Bones]
People all around me seem to sink so deep
By trying to fight the tears and right their wrongs
Wave hello goodbye
To brief controlling sadness
Hello so long
Till we meet again

[Chorus]
Honestly I'm tryna take it one day at a time I've been here before
Keep me out of my way
'Cause I'd like to be here tomorrow
I'm alright, I'm fine
I promised I won't give up without a fight
It's me, myself and I
We'll make it right out alive
[Verse 2: Clara Benin]
Lately I've been going through the motions
Struggling to get me out of bed
But I'm not gonna liе, I'm not gonna lie it's just harder thesе days I put on a smile, I put on a smile and say

[Chorus]
Honestly I'm tryna take it one day at a time I've been here before
Keep me out of my way
'Cause I'd like to be here tomorrow
I'm alright, I'm fine
I promised I won't give up without a fight
It's me, myself and I
We'll make it right out alive

[Outro]
Love yourself today if you can
It'll be fine tomorrow my friend
Let's take this from one to ten
And Once we dance, it's never gone end
I'm alright, I'm fine
I promised I won't give without a fight
It's me, myself and I
Taking one day at a timeYou might also likeEmbed
