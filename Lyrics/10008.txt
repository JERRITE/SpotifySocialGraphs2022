Expiration Date Lyrics[Guitar Xeryus]

[Verse 1]
Girl, you're so far gone, I know you meant it
You cut all your hair off, yeah these days you're lookin' different
You switched up your number 'cause I had to use the DM
I was dialin' the old one from AM, noon, to PM, shit
So your mama know we broke up
I see you blocked me, baby, grow up
Don't shut me out, baby girl, hold up
I know that you heard all this before
I never thought I'd see the day when you ignore me
[Pre-Chorus]
But every woman has a day when she gets tired of the games
And she gets tired of being played like she's a toy
She finds the strength to up and leave
And she wakes up and finally sees
That you ain't nothin' like a king, you're just a boy

[Chorus]
You've reached your expiration date, yeah
You've reached your expiration date

[Verse 2]
Let me guess, I bet you're all in your group text
Textin' your girls how I'm a dog now
And I bet they're goin' in
You keep on listenin' to your friends
Although they're single and they're played out
You're prolly goin' out tonight
You're prolly gettin' dressed up right now
You're prolly gettin' drunk tonight
You're plottin' how you're gon' get me back somehow
Oh, baby, I know
How tables turn, yeah, I know
You live and learn, yeah, I know
I know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But every woman has a day when she gets tired of the games
And she gets tired of being played like she's a toy
She finds the strength to up and leave
And she wakes up and finally sees
That you ain't nothin' like a king, you're just a boy

[Chorus]
You've reached your expiration date, yeah
You've reached your expiration date
I've reached my expiration date, oh, oh
I've reached my expiration date, oh
I'm sorry1Embed
