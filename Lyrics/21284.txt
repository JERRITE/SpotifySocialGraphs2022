Actions Speak Louder Than Words Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another story
One more tale to tell
Another trick to get by
But I know
That's a bold face lie
Another promise
That was bound to break
Am I just losing my mind?
So it goes
It's the same old line
[Pre-Chorus]
It never ends
So don't pretend

[Chorus]
They say that actions speak much louder than words
So if you please just show a sign
Your true intentions well they better be pure
Please don't waste my time

[Verse 2]
You keep it coming
Like a hurricane
It's rolling tumbling down
A heavy load
Gonna, shake, shake, shake you out

[Pre-Chorus]
The spin goes on
So prove me wrong

[Chorus]
They say that actions speak much louder than words
So if you please just show a sign
Your true intentions well they better be pure
Please don't waste my time
You might also like[Bridge]
But I got something
That you will never take
No
Lord knows that I am way too proud
I lived and learned
This is the last time I'll be burned

[Guitar Break]

[Chorus]
They say that actions speak much louder than words
So if you please just show a sign
Your true intentions well they better be pure
Please don't waste my time
They say that actions speak much louder than words
So if you please just do me right
Your true intentions well they better be pure
Please don't waste my time
Your true intentions well they better be pure
Please don't waste my timeEmbed
