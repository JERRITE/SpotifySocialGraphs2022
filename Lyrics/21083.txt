Cast-Off Lyrics[Verse 1: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
I guess it's terrible
But it don't feel so bad
I abide and I may hold a key
To being gratefully glad (Mission on my way down)
You smile in my face (On my way down)
And all the time, you wanna hit replace (I've been all the way around)
Here's my back for stabbin'
But I'll make it up

[Pre-Chorus: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
I won't wait it up (I won't taint it up)
I won't tear you down (I won't taint it up)
I won't crave it up (Won't taint it up)
I won't stand up
I won't taint it up (Taint it up)
I won't stand down
When you cast me off
[Chorus: Bruce Hornsby]
I'll be, I'll be your cast-off
Be your discarded toy
I'll be, I'll be your cast-off
Be your maybe sometime choice
Self-loathing never felt so good
And so it should
I'll be your cast-off
I'll be your discarded toy
Be your rejection foil

[Pre-Chorus: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
I won't wait it up (I won't taint it up)
I won't tear you down (I won't taint it up)
I won't crave it up (Won't taint it up)
Gonna stand down
I won't taint it up (Taint it up)
I won't stand in doubt
When you cast me off

[Chorus: Bruce Hornsby]
I'll be, I'll be your cast-off
Be your discarded toy
I'll be, I'll be your cast-off
Be your maybe sometime choice
Be your rejection foil
You might also like[Bridge: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
I kinda ain't shit
But I embrace it
I can be okay
I'll take what I can get
And like it (Ooh)
And like it well
(Ooh)

[Chorus: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
I'll be your cast-off
Be your discarded one (Ooh)
Discarded toy (Ah)
Discarded chew toy
(Ooh-ah)

[Outro: Bruce Hornsby, Justin Vernon]
Smile in my face (Ooh)
And all the timen you wanna take my place
Here's my back for stabbin'
(Ooh)
(Ooh)Embed
