TranslationsFran√ßaisTalk So Much Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard you got something to say
My friends told me that you been saying
Lies about me
So what's up? Tell me
Don't hide, couldn't keep it to yourself
You tried, but now those words are coming back
To bite you, I used to like you
But now I see a different side, I've been lied to, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry if you got a problem with yourself
You tryna put it on me, I don't need no help
From you
Shut up, yeah
[Chorus]
Why you tryna talk so much? (So much)
You ain't never say it to my face, why you being brave?
Always tryna talk too much (Too much)
All the shit you say behind my back, it's gettin' back to me
I ain't gonna change, stay the same, that's my status
If you wanna hate, you gon' hate 'cause you jealous
Why you tryna talk so much? (So much)
Why you tryna talk so much?

[Verse 2]
Fake people hide behind their phones
They only talk when they alone
And pray they don't get caught up
But I caught you now so

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry if you got a problem with yourself
You tryna put it on me, I don't need no help
From you
Shut up, yeah

[Chorus]
Why you tryna talk so much? (So much)
You ain't never say it to my face, why you being brave?
Always tryna talk too much (Too much)
All the shit you say behind my back, it's gettin' back to me
I ain't gonna change, stay the same, that's my status
If you wanna hate, you gon' hate 'cause you jealous
Why you tryna talk so much? (So much)
Why you tryna talk so much?
You might also like[Bridge]
Why you talkin' so much, talkin' so much?
Always seeing your name poppin' up
Why you talkin' so much, talkin' so much?
Why you tryna talk so much?

[Outro]
Why you tryna talk so much?
Why you tryna talk so much?
Talk so much, oh
I ain't gonna change, stay the same, that's my status
If you wanna hate, you gon' hate 'cause you jealous
Why you tryna talk so much? (So much)
Why you tryna talk so much?Embed
