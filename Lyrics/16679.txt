Ice Cream Castles Lyrics[Verse 1]
We are young
We are free on earth together
Let's fall in love
You are fine
You are white, I am of color
Let's fall in love

[Chorus]
Ice cream castles in the summertime
Ice cream castles in the summers
[Verse 2]
I want you
You want me, we want each other
Is that so wrong?
It's raining
Mad sisters, why can't they realize
That it won't be long?

[Chorus]
We're all
Ice cream castles in the summertime
Ice cream castles in the summers


[Refrain]
(Let's do something) Let's
(Let's do something)
(Let's do something) Do
(Let's do something) Something
(Let's do something) Soon

[Verse 3]
We are young
We are free, let's come together
Before the end
I am blue
You are too â€” what could be better?
Let's make friends
You might also like[Chorus]
We're all
Ice cream castles in the summertime
Ice cream castles in the summertime
We're all
Ice cream castles in the summer
Ice cream castles when we fall
Ice cream castles in the summertime
Summertime, summertime, summertime

[Bridge]
Is that what you need? Uh
White girls
Black girls
Orientals
Jamaican, huh

[Chorus]
Ice cream castles in the summertime
We're all ice cream castles in the summer
Ice cream castles when we fall
Ice cream castles in the summertime
Summertime

[Bridge]
White girls, uh
Black girls, huh, uh-uh
Orientals (I want you)
Jamaican (You want me, we want each other)
White girls, Black girls

Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
Let's do something, let's do something soon
