TranslationsPortuguêsBleed Magic Lyrics[Intro]
Should I– should I try it again?
Yeah, that's fine

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you home
A night out on the town
Say that you’re pretty so you stand up, stand up
Before I drag you down

[Pre-Chorus]
Crawling up your skin
Potions, pills and medicines
To drain you
And bleed your magic out
(Oops)
[Chorus]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Lonely little life
And nobody believes you now
You’re bleeding magic out
[Verse 2]
​Don’t want to scare you off
Don’t want to know your name
You’ll never know a single thing about me
Until it’s far too late, late

[Pre-Chorus]
Crawling up your skin
Potion, pleasing medicines
To circumvent your brain

[Chorus]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Lonely little life
And nobody believes you now
You’re bleeding magic

[Snappy Guitar Solo]
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Lonely little life
Oh, and nobody believes you now
You’re bleeding magic out somehow
And nobody believes you now
You’re bleeding magic

[Instrumental Interlude]
