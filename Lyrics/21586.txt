Best days - album version final LyricsEvery time I look at you
You always look so beautiful
Driving on the road again
The Chevys packed than and it is dust
And I would take some photographs
So I can dream of you
Can't say I've felt
Such twisting in my heart this way
We picture Ted and Avon sleeping
While you stay awake
The fire's burning softly
Singing songs so close to you
Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my life
Can't take away those times
We stayed up and we talked all night
Chain smoking cigarettes and
Three bottles of red wine
Falling asleep together
Holding your body close to mine
And in the morning
Your eyes opened so innocent
The sun is blazing we are sweating
You look lovely
Nothing else matters anymore
'Coz you're in my arms again
Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
Oh, I never want to be without you
So just stay with me
I will love you endlessly
Oh darling, darling
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
Do you believe
In love at first sight?
I think you do
We're hanging out with one another
Those are the best days of my life
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my lifeYou might also likeEmbed
