Double the Pain LyricsA stab in the back
Is worth waiting for tonight
He's seen enough joy for today
A sudden attack
Would just start the evening right
And maybe a penance to pain

Thunder and lightning, electric machines
These are the devils that shout in his dreams

Double the pain, he's strong, he will survive
Double the pain, it will make him come alive
Double the pain
Games of the heart
Not fair and you can't win
But torture and anger can play
You've never said no
To just another spin
And losing is one step away

Friendly confusion, like nothing you've seen
These are the demons that shout in his dreams

Double the pain, he's strong, he will survive
Double the pain, it will make him come alive
Double the pain

A slap in the face
To bring him back around
It's a touch like cool morning rain
He's fallen from grace
And slammed to the ground
And begs for some more of the same

Thunder and lightning, eccentric machines
These are the devils that shout in his dreams

Double the pain, he's strong he will survive
Double the pain, it will make him come alive
Double the pain, I'm sure I saw him smile
Double the pain, let's kick him for a while
And double the painYou might also likeEmbed
