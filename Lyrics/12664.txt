Dear Percocet, I Don’t Think We Should See Each Other Anymore Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, let me go

[Verse 1]
I wanna be more conscious
I wanna live in the now
I wanna be the taste on your lips and the curse on your tongue, I wanna make you spit, fuck

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna die yet, just wish that I could be remembered
I just sit and watch life pass me by with eyes of longing
[Verse 2]
Dry your fucking eyes, baby
Let’s shut our mouths, not our hearts
This is the face of a pig who cares too damn much about what others think
I wanna live for a scream, not a screen
I'll do anything to save what's in front of me

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna die yet, just wish that I could be remembered
I just watch my life pass me by, with eyes of longing
I don’t wanna die yet, just wish that I could be remembered
Not longingly stare at an empty sky that holds nothing but rain

[Outro]
Sometimes the place you're trying to escape is the only place you fucking belong
Burn it down
Bathe in the fire
Leave a scar everywhere
This life is yours, if you want itYou might also like2Embed
