Tight Squeeze LyricsTight squeeze

Fiesty

Street action and

Get hit with this beam action

Shawty with that street action

Shot fired retreat action
Run up let that heat catch him

Na Na

I Don't really care bout what these haters say

Run up me say I let this heater spray

Love me girl weâ€™ll be okay

Feel me girl we'll be okay

Don't wanna stay but please just stay


Shawty u my kryptonite

Walked by me u catch my eye

Tell me that U ride or die

Say u gon be by my sideYou might also likeEmbed
