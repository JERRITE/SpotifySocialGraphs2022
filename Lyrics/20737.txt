Hit & Run Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hollywood and New York, mister major
Then there's me, little queen of the stage, yeah
He's a god, one the stars call creator
Hail the king of the industry players

[Pre-Chorus]
Take off your business suit
Sittin' in your lap for my interview

[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
[Verse 2]
Pick me up in your white Lamborghini
London town, you'll watch out while I'm singing
Glamorous on the stage, boy, believe me
Keep your girl back, no competing

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyein' you from across the room
Watchin' me, wa-watchin' you

[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Post-Chorus]
You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay, w!)anna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Bridge]
Oh oh
Oh oh
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly, deadly, deadly
You might also like[Chorus]
Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

[Post-Chorus]
You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay, w!)anna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world11Embed
