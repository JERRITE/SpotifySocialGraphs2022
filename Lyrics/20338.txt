Nuclear (Hands Up) Lyrics[Intro]
Whoa!, Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

[Chours]
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear
Come on, and let me see your hands in the air
With your air days when you jump off on your chair
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
Come on
[Refrain]
Whoa!, Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!
Come on

[Refrain]
Whoa!, Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

[Chours]
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear
Come on, and let me see your hands in the air
With your air days when you jump off on your chair
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
Come on

[Drop]

Come on...
Come on...
