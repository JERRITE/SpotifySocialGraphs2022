To The Wire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you still drive silver mustang
Does it still have Texas plates
If I call you, would you answer
Is your number still the same

[Pre-Chorus]
When you think back
On the summer
Did you get chills head to feet
When you think back
On the winter
Do you miss my body heat
[Chorus]
If we're moving on forever
Got to let you go (Got to let you go)
If we're getting back together
Got to let me know (Got to let me know)
Cause it's getting down to the wire
To the wire
To the wire
Cause it's getting down to the wire
Lights went off can we turn em back on

[Drop]
Lights went off can we turn em back on

[Verse 2]
All the pictures
We took in London
Can't erase em from my phone
Every moment was a movie
Now the days go by so full

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think back
On the summer
Got nostalgia in my veins
When I think back
On the winter
I regret asking for space, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
If we're moving on forever
Got to let you go
If we're getting back together
Got to let me know
Cause it's getting down to the wire
To the wire
To the wire
Cause it's getting down to the wire
Lights went off can we turn em back on

[Drop]
Lights went off can we turn em back on

[Bridge]
You can call me
If you want it too
Cause I won't keep
Holding on to you
Tell me
If you miss it too
Cause it's getting down to the wire
Lights went off can we turn em back on

[Chorus]
If we're moving on forever
Got to let you go
If we're getting back together
Got to let me know
Cause it's getting down to the wire
To the wire
To the wire
Cause it's getting down to the wire
Lights went off can we turn em back on
[Drop]
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Cause it's getting down to the wire
To the wire
To the wire
Cause it's getting down to the wire
Lights went off can we turn em back onEmbed
