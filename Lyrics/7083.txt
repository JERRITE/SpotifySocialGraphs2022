THEY UPSET Lyrics[Verse 1]
Grounded, peaceful, calm
Powerful, I get everything I want
Courageous, I’m everything you not, everything you not
I lead with grace, I’m too angelic to fuck with lames
No small talk here, how ‘bout world domination?
I made mistakes, I’m not ashamed

[Hook]
How you not in the field, but you feel a way?
Bulletproof, I just let the words wash away
Judge me? That’s fine, I’m set
Prolly why they so upset
[Verse 2]
Big goals, I made a decision, I’m commited
Santa Monica, I’m chillin’ reppin’ with a Yankee’s fitted
You don’t get it, I’m differant, that’s fine
Been knew I’m ahead of my time

[Hook]
How you not in the field, but you feel a way?
Bulletproof, I just let the words wash away
Judge me? That’s fine, I’m set
Prolly why they so upset

[Verse 3]
I’m not of this world
Try to fit in, feel absurd
It’s a fly girl curse, I don’t think there’s a curse
I think I had a breakdown, I swear it was a blur
No one to look up to, you doin’ it first

[Hook]
How you not in the field, but you feel a way?
Bulletproof, I just let the words wash away
Judge me? That’s fine, I’m set
Prolly why they so upsetYou might also likeEmbed
