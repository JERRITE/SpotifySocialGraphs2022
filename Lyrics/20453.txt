Togetherness Lyrics[Galavant, Isabella, Sid, All]
We eat together
We drink together
We work in perfect sync together
We smile
Frown
Blink
Together completely
We walk together
In time together
Can't help
Yelp
Kelp
But rhyme together
Our voices chime together so neatly
And togetherness is what we do
Together, me and him and you
Like rock!
And scissors
And paper

And stuck together
All day together
We're in each other's way together
Our quirks are on display together
Or nearly

They fight together
They glare together
We breathe each other's air together
[Galavant and Isabella] We watch him do his hair together

[spoken]
Come on, really?
But togetherness will see us through
Unless I kill the other two
[Galavant and Sid] Or we kill her together

But there's some things we don't share
Like the way I've kind of, sort of, totally played him
Oh, God, I betrayed him
And there's some things we don't share
Like I'm kind of, sort of, always thinking about her
Or like how you both ignore me all of the—
You might also likeEach day together's a chore together
A belching
Nagging
Bore together
[Galavant and Sid] Then listening to her snore together

[Isabella loudly snoring]

[Spoken]
And... I'm done
But together, though, what we'll be
For what feels like eternity
Together
Me
And me
And me
As one
As one
As one
As—
One!Embed
