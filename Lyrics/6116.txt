Came Here For Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm no longer brokenhearted
So glad I came here tonight
And I see you got what I wanted
Baby, you got what I like

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see that you watching me
Come over, talk to me
Need you to give me a sign
You got that something sweet
That don't come easily
It's what I need tonight
[Chorus]
I came here for love
For someone to hold me down
I won't give it up, no
I want you to reach out

[Post-Chorus]
I came here for love
I came here for love
I came here for love
I want you to reach out

[Verse 2]
I'm so ready to get on it
You follow me, you'll be fine
And I'm in too deep
Have I fallen, without anyone inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see that you watching me
Come over, talk to me
Need you to give me a sign
You got that something sweet
That don't come easily
It's what I need tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
I came here for love
For someone to hold me down
I won't give it up, no
I want you to reach out

[Post-Chorus]
I came here for love
I came here for love
I want you to reach out

[Bridge]
This is what we came here for
We came here for love
I won't give, I won't give it up
This is what we came here for
We came here for love
I know this, I know it's enough
This is what we came here for
We came here for love
I won't give, I won't give it up
This is what we came here for
We came here for love
I want you to reach out

[Chorus]
I came here for love
For someone to hold me down
I won't give it up, no
I want you to reach out
[Post-Chorus]
I came here for love
I came here for love
I want you to reach out7Embed
