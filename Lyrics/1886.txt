Fairplay Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think it's kind of funny
You could say you love me
Turn around and play me, yeah
I think it's kind of funny
You say things you don't mean
Underestimate me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I have always done right by you
Said you're never going to lie, liar
Shit gon' come around full cycle
I flip the script on you
[Chorus]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fair play

[Verse 2]
Now I got your attention
Let me ask a question
Did you learn your lesson?
Did it go over your brain?
Now that we're confessin'
I thought we were destined
You were Mr. Right but you went looking other ways, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I have always done right by you
Said you're never going to lie, liar
Shit gon' come around full cycle
I flip the script on you

[Chorus]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn (Turn)
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same (Yeah, yeah)
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fair play

What goes around comes back around
Guess he wasn't ready for that fair play
What goes around comes back around
Guess he wasn't ready for that

[Chorus]
Tell me why you mad
Tell me why you're hurt
Bet you didn't think that the tables would turn
You gon' fuck around
I'ma do the same
How you like that karma?
How you like that karma?
Yeah, that's just fair play8Embed
