Homeland Lyrics[Verse 1: Laws]
I’m on an overnight plane ride
I’m tryin' to balance two lives at the same time
I used to think I make a killin' with the same rhymes
Till the bigger picture made me go and change my frame of mind
But they yellin' out stop Laws
It’s like they thought I went pop ‘cause I popped off
I’m on your radar only just to drop off
Them other cats are chickens and this the hot sauce
It makes ‘em go down easier
You lack vision then wonder why I Stevie ya
And this song written in the key of life
I take it back to the days of Pedialyte
‘Cause now my mother is my friend and I need her advice
If I make money, who cares if I read or write?
And rappers pay writers, then pay lawyers to read
I don’t do either plus we all can agree
I brought happiness in the homeland
[Hook]
I been long gone and I’m on my way home
But I didn’t forget you
I never forget that I been around the world
And I, I, I let ‘em know my hometown
I ain’t forget to, we from the middle of nowhere
There’s no place like home

[Verse 2: Laws]
With these hands, I create words that they’ll talk about on C-SPAN
And teenage Laws really tryin' to see Japan
2011 Laws really tryin' to see his fam
It’s either Fuji or the movies with my nephew
Stonehenge and great times with old friends
I bet you, put in the same position, would be after greener grass
When you movin' so fast that they barely see your past
When friends stop callin' cause they watch your progress on a blog site
Thinkin' that it’s alright
And when my brother went to war, it wasn’t on NahRight
Every day, the chance is betted that I won’t be called Mike
But even when that Laws sound is too hot to handle
I'll still be food shopping in publics in my socks and sandals
When the shawty at the register scan, she’ll skip a few items
‘Cause she a fan and I brought that happiness in the homeland

[Hook]

So I’m bringin' that happiness, I’ll gladly get y'all the trophy
‘Cause we ain’t had a Grammy yet and this kid used to never dress out for phys ED
He would diss the teacher and sit on the bleachers instead
Makin' music, not the kind they teach in any class
That ain’t no Sousa March, that ain’t no Pledge the Flag
This for my high school sweetheart, I miss ya
The dust you left me in turned into a twister
I’m still the same OG, soundin' like a younger you
But still the same old me
This is for the alley by the dollar flicks, beat boxin', freestyles
How we got it in, oh, how I got at them
Dissed ‘em but they all loved it
Years from now, they’ll probably give paid tours of it
They couldn’t cage a classic
I fought in the prison and left the jail
And then came back as the warden
Bringin' happiness in the homeland
