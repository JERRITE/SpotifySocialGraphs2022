Diamond Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Madness is my old friend
We don't need fancy drinks and penthouse suites
To run a riot
And you, you were just a fling
A beautiful addition to the
Valley of my vices

[Pre-Chorus]
We're different people
Adam and Evil
Dreaming alone
You smile at the sunrise
I long for a landslide
Baby you know
[Chorus]
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
And no there's nothing wrong
But I'm already gone
Like headlights in the dawn
We've had our fun
The diamond days are done

[Verse 2]
Pearls hang around my neck
You tie a noose on me
With every gift a velvet coffin
Down Mulholland drive
I pray to hells angels
We crash in the vanilla sky

[Pre-Chorus]
We're different people
Adam and Evil
Dreaming alone

[Chorus]
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
And no there's nothing wrong
But I'm already gone
Like headlights in the dawn
We've had our fun
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
You might also like[Bridge]
Madness is my old friend
We don't need fancy drinks and penthouse suites
To run a riot

[Chorus]
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done1Embed
