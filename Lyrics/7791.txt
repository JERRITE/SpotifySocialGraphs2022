Next Plane Home LyricsI woke up early to baby blue eyes from afar
And when the sun comes through
Lights you like the angel you are

I know I do you wrong
When I'm with you I've been gone

With every season change it looks the same
November to June
And on these empty streets
I skip a beat the flowers don’t bloom
I can't believe I missed your birthday again
And I want to come back
But I just don't know when, now

And I'm so lonely
You're not here with me
That’s why I'm gonna be on the next plane home

The road that never ends
Round the bend I see you smile
I'd swim across the sea
To be with you for awhile

'Cause I made a life of being gone
Now the way that I feel is that I just don't belong here

And I'm so lonely
You're not here with me
That's why I'm gonna be on the next plane home
And you're, you're the only place I wanna see
That’s why I'm gonna be on the next plane home

I stand around trying to make every moment
And be somebody, yeah anybody
It seems the whole world is taking me over
I need somebody to help me get back to you
You might also likeAnd I've always been a million miles away
But things are gonna change I just wanna come home
And you're, you're the only place I wanna see
That's why I'm gonna be on the next plane home

Yeah I'm taking the next plane home
Now I'm getting the next plane home
Now I'm taking the next plane homeEmbed
