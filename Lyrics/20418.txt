Feel My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone told me
Love was only
In the movies
It don't exist in real life these days now
But you showed me
If I only just find the faith I need to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Anything is possible
If you want it bad enough
Know the sky, ain't too high
Test your limits
You can feel unstoppable
Incredible
Almost there, I can see I'm so ready
[Chorus]
Oh this has gotta be the night that dreams come true
Everything feels just right
Girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love
Imma have you like
Ah
Said you feel my love
Ah
Girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love

[Verse 2]
Someone told me
That it's unlikely
To do other things you wanna do cuz life just ain't fair now
But don't be lonely
Find somebody
Then it won't be so hard for you to see

[Pre-Chorus]
That anything is possible
If you want it bad enough
Know the sky, ain't too high
Test your limits
You can feel unstoppable
Incredible
Almost there, I can see I'm so ready
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh this has gotta be the night that dreams come true
Everything feels just right
Girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love
Imma have you like
Ah
Said you feel my love
Ah
Oh girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love

[Bridge]
Everything that I've ever wanted, right in front of me
Not a dream, eyes wide open
Girl I'm here and I'm coming in
Doors are closing
I won't run cause I'm chosen
I won't run cause I know that

[Chorus]
Oh this has gotta be the night that dreams come true
Everything feels just right
Girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love
Imma have you like
Ah
Said you feel my love
Ah
Oh girl when I'm with you, you know, girl i'll be holdin' on
Said you feel my love
Did you feel my love12Embed
