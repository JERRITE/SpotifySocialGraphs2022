Different Way to Dance Lyrics[Verse 1: Corbin]
Hey, stop, play it back
Did you not see how they move like that?
Look, pay attention to me
Hear the bounce, hear the beat
Sliding your feet too fast
Gotta take it real smooth
Keep it cool
Even if you don't know all the rules
Play the game
All the same win or lose
Well, you never really lose
With the right attitude
[Pre-Chorus: Corbin]
Notice your focus
And find your center
I know that you know this
You just need to remember

[Chorus: Corbin]
It's all about passion
One, two feet on the floor
Move it like that
And see what might happen
Ball's in your court (Whoo-hoo)
You think you can't work it? (Work it)
How about taking a chance? (Haha)
Becausе at the end of the day
It's just a diffеrent way to dance
It's just a different way to

[Verse 2: Corbin & Gina, both]
Don't fight the technique
Let your body glide effortlessly
They're up in your face
Just hit the jeté
You see what I mean?
What if I trip and fall?
Forget it
What if I drop the ball?
It happens
I don’t want to risk it all
You gotta
Even the best start out at the bottom
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Corbin]
Notice your focus (Ayy)
And find your center
I know that you know this
You just need to remember

[Chorus: Corbin & Gina, both]
It's all about passion
One, two feet on the floor
Feet on the floor
Move it like that
And see what might happen
Ball's in your court (The ball's in my court)
You think you can’t work it? (Work it)
How about taking a chance? (Taking a chance)
Because at the end of the day
It's just a different way to dance (Aha)
It's just a different way to dance (Ahh)
A different way to dance
Hey
Dance

[Pre-Chorus: Corbin]
Practice ain't perfect
But you'll get better (Ah ah ah)
There's no competition
As long as you remember
[Chorus: Corbin & Gina]
It's all about passion (Ooo)
One, two feet on the floor
Feet on the floor
Move it like that
And see what might happen
Ball's in your court
You think you can’t work it? (Work it)
How about taking a chance? (Taking a chance)
Because at the end of the day
It's just a different way to dance
It's just a different way to dance (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's just a different way to dance (Ohh)
Different way to, different way to dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Different way to dance
