Girl / On the Run LyricsPart I: Girl

[Intro]
(I love you, Benji)

[Verse 1]
Curvy mamacita in her element
Know a couple things that she do better than my last one
'Cause all the ones I thought for me were heaven sent
Can't remember names 'cause they not relevant, you hold that shit down (Down, down)
You so fire when you wake up (Wake up)
Girl you don't gotta say much (Say much)
Baby, I'll do the talkin'
Taste good, can I put you on everything?
Heat it up, tease your body 'til it's simmering, oh
[Chorus]
Girl, can I run it back?
Girl, can I fuck with you?
Girl, would you like that? (Girl)
Aw, when you gon' bе my girl?
Can I sip on it, girl?
Say my name for me, girl, oh yeah (Girl)
Girl, can I run it back?
Girl, can I fuck with you?
Girl, would you likе that? (Girl)
Aw, when you gon' be, girl?
Can I sip on it, girl?
Say my name for me, girl, oh yeah (Girl)

[Verse 2]
Can I see you break it in?
Can I lead you where nobody can?
In the morning, makin' you scream
You sound like angel when you sing (Yeah)
Hands I got 'em tied to your toes (Toes)
So deep, I can feel on your soul
I know how you want it so good (Good)
Shivering, all of it, I know

[Chorus]
Girl, can I run it back?
Girl, can I fuck with you?
Girl, would you like that? (Girl)
Aw, when you gon' be my girl?
Can I sip on it, girl?
Say my name for me, girl, oh yeah (Girl)
Girl, can I run it back?
Girl, can I fuck with you?
Girl, would you like that? (Girl)
Aw, when you gon' be, girl?
Can I sip on it, girl?
Say my name for me, girl, oh yeah (Girl)

This-this, this-this, this what time I'm on (On)
I know what you want (Want)

[Verse]
You do it like a big stepper
How you brought the vibe up to another level?
Got you in my sheets and now you ridin' at my tempo
Actin' out a scene, girl, it be so suspenseful
Save energy for round two, it won't take long (Long)
'Cause I don't need nobody (Body)
Just me and your body (Body)
Just me and your body (Body)
Come and sit down shawty
Don't be late for the party (Party)

Pulled up in the front (Front)
Got you on the run (Run)
