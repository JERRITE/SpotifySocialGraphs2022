Broke In Amsterdam Lyrics[Verse 1]
Grab a shirt or two
Pack a bag
We'll go
We leave that
Grown up life alone
Like back few years ago
Two kids right out of school
Nothing but happy to the bones

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we'll fly
Right into the night
To the city we can rely
We were legends in time
And all we need
Running wild in the streets
Give me one more night
To get some life back into my heart like
[Chorus]
We can travel back in time
Back when
We were young
I rem–µmber
How we shined
Broke in Amsterdam
You followed me, I followed you
There was nothing else we needed to do
We're staying up
For the morning sun
Broke in Amsterdam

Broke in Amsterdam

[Verse 2]
We had no mobile phones
Took photos on our own
Our pictures saved
Inside our minds
Stumbling on the boulevards
Breaking some girls' hearts
Life is not an easy win
When it starts

[Pre-Chorus]
Live, we'll fly
Right into the night
To the city we can rely
We were legends in time
And all we need
Running wild in the streets
Give me one more night
To get some life back into my heart like
You might also like[Chorus]
We can travel back in time
Back when
We were young
I remember
How we shined
Broke in Amsterdam
You followed me, I followed you
There was nothing else we needed to do
We're staying up
For the morning sun
Broke in Amsterdam
