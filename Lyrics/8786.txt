This Magic Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes
[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

[Bridge]
Oh (magic)
Oh (magic)
Mmm (magic)

[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time
