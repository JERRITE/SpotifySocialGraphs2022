Good Game Lyrics[Chorus]
Well, don't you become your daddy (Mm-mm-mm)
Boy, you show so much promise (Mm-mm-mm)
It's okay to be unhappy (Ooh)
With all this (Woo, woah)

[Post-Chorus]
What's it like to be you?
Do you see me that way?
Do you remember my name? (Woo)
I want her, I want her to be just like you (Woah)
I want her, I want her to be just like you (Woo)
I want her, I want her to be just like you (Woah)
[Verse]
Boy, you know you're my favorite, do-do-do-do-do
Just like me in my day, but
You got all your priorities mixed up
At least you're not David (Woo), yeah
I'm glad you got out of Naples
What's it like being famous?
Do you remember my name, huh?
Or do you see a stranger when you look at my face? 'Cause (Do you remember?)
Sometimes, I wanna save you from everything
Like your problems and the dangers of everyday life (Do you remember?)
It's impossible to say what you're gonna be (Do you remember?)
But if you're gonna become someone

[Chorus]
Well, don't you become your daddy (Mm-mm-mm)
Boy, you show so much promise (Mm-mm-mm)
It's okay to be unhappy (Woo, do you remember my name?)
With all this (Do you see me that way?)
(Do you remember my name? Woah)

[Post-Chorus]
Woo (Woah)
I want her, I want her to be just like you
I want her, I want her to be just like you
I want her, I want her to be just like you
I want herYou might also like3Embed
