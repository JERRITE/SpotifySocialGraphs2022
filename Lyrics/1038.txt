Little Love (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breathing gets hard to do, my lungs go black and blue
My heart breaks into two
I think that all I needs a little love, just a little love, mmm
I'm stuck in space and time and I live a lonely life
But I'm trying to survive
Without the help of just a little love, just a little love
Just a little love

[Pre-Chorus]
Walking down this road but don't know where it's leading me
Need someone to take me home
[Chorus]
I'm on my knees praying, but no one hears a word I'm saying
I'm crying to the skies above, to the skies above
All I needs a little love, just a little love

[Verse 2]
Wake up to an empty bed, no shoulder to rest my head
No energy to move my legs
I know that all I needs a little love, just a little love
Just a little love, oh-oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Running down this road, but nobody is chasing me
Need someone to take me home

[Chorus]
I'm on my knees praying, but no one hears a word I'm saying
I'm crying to the skies above, to the skies above
All I needs a little love, just a little love
I see my soul flying, alone and it's terrifying
I'm crying to the skies above, to the skies above
All I needs a little love, yeah

[Bridge]
Although the sun keeps rising up, the rain keeps falling down
Been on the ground so long that I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
And I'm still on my knees praying, but no one hears a word I'm saying
I'm crying to the skies above, all I needs a little love
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm on my knees praying, but no one hears a word I'm saying
I'm crying to the skies above, to the skies above
All I needs a little love, oh
And I see my soul flying, alone and it's terrifying
I'm crying to the skies above, to the skies above
All I needs a little loveEmbed
