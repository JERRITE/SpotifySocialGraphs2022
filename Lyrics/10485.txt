Steel Lyrics[Verse 1: Namasenda]
You've got a heart made of steel
But I can see your eyes melting
Tell me how you really feel
You think you're bulletproof
But I can tell you're really hurting
I could be good for you

[Hook: Namasenda]
I know you're scared
Can't forget all the times that you cried
Been building walls up to the sky
Protect your heart at times
But for now it's you and I
You, you, you and I
For now it's you and I
You, you, you and I
For now (you, you, you, you)
[Verse 2: Namasenda]
Your mind is the ocean
And in the waves I'm floating
Baby, you need time to heal
Our love and emotion is keeping me from going under
Tell me baby if it's real

[Verse 3: Hannah Diamond]
I know you're scared
But trust me when I say you make me feel so safe
I'm yours, you're mine, my lifeline
The kind of love that lasts a lifetime in our hearts
And nothing will change, we'll be the same (we'll be the same)
Hearts forged in love's eternal flame
Torn apart and enchained, back again

[Hook: Namasenda]
I know you're scared
Can't forget all the times that you cried (it’s you and I)
Been building walls up to the sky
Protect your heart at times (it’s you and I)
But for now it's you and I
You, you, you and I (it’s you and I)
It's you and I
You, you, you and I (it’s you and I)
For now

It's you and I
It's you and I, I, I, I
It's you and I (you, you)
It's you and I (I, I, I)Embed
