Not One of Them Lyrics[Verse 1: JL]
I be trying not to fly off the handle
Be aware is all you can do
Scandalous, always in a scandal
Niggas wanna hand out, but I got my hands full
Who you with? What side?
Made a decision and I stuck by it
Follow my gut I may be a nut job
But I don't be putting my faith in nobody but God
Not one of those
Niggas that cannot be approached
Try to [?] at average shows
Lost and he goes, be defined by the clothes
And be overly confident with his eyes wide closed
And they lied to the most
Know that if I'm overload that the foes in a hot tea 'pose
And they stop speech smoke
Troubles be arriving at lows
But I never be surprised by these hoes
If I do it's a party
Still moving, I'm starving
And you won't get "excuse me" or "sorry"
You could be controlling the car
Be the passenger seat or in the back seat confused where are we
Ain't nobody choosing it for me
When you are being, getting misused in a heartbeat
Get your hopes up thinking I'ma choke up
No luck, leave heartbroken, don't start me
[Hook: JL]
I'm not one of them
Shocked with a scam
Watching does not get it in
Possible opposition, talk and pretend
Throw rocks and then pocket his hand
I'm not one of them
Lost in the wind, caught sleepwalkin' the land
Poppin a xan, zombie mockin' a trend
Not what I offered to them
I'm not one of them
You thought I was a friend, then cock blocking the win
Not gonna stand, still but the obstacle been
Flocking a conflict again
I'm not one of them
You could turn an event, gun yeah - got one of them
Pop to defend, my shit cocked coming in
I'll set it off in the end
I'm not one of them

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Was all in their eyes, can't ignore the disguise
When I rise, we be the different ones
Got me blazin'
Someday when they was changin'
I'm not one of your average
I'm a leader, a savage
No toleration for bad bitches
Goals for the team will be lavish
He would enjoy the status
I was supporting the habits
We used to go for the cabbage
Give it to me to do mileage
Do it for the team, only God know
Brought my nigga in on a high note
Way back when had high hopes
Took you overseas, I apply though
Just us three on the slide though
Everything cool, what do I know?
Got up in the wind yes I got soul
Still waiting on a call from Picasso
I would never ever let my nigga do this
Team Stone not gonna do this
Keep it all real got Frizz pissed
Looking at a fan pic, pig's ditch
Really fucked up how you did real
Move to the city then a nigga bailed
Frizz had a feeling, didn't open mail
All past due, nigga, all L's
I can't really recollect when we last spoke
Met you in Vegas for the last show
Came to the crib then you got dough
Embracing little love, then you got low
I don't really even know, gotta shake it off me
Words cut deep, gon' bleed softly
Nigga said the move, it could be costly
Said to move with your girl when you're brewing coffee

I'm not one of them
Shocked with a scam
Watching does not get it in
Possible opposition, talk and pretend
Throw rocks and then pocket his hand
I'm not one of them

Poppin a xan, zombie mockin' a trend
Not what I offered to them
I'm not one of them
You thought I was a friend, then cock blocking the win
Not gonna stand, still but the obstacle been
Flocking a conflict again
I'm not one of them
You could turn an event, gun yeah - got one of them
Pop to defend, my shit cocked coming in
I'll set it off in the end

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hold up
Not one of them caught mumblin'
Mock one of them, lot dim I'm in
Stop with the plots to be shocked from the sin
Blocked in the end
Off in the future, who could shoot ya
The looser knock on the venge'
'Cause they don't got evidence to break and damage our residence
I peeped their vendetta, went to hell with the shit they said
I sent, you bitches don't get it bent
If you missin' the head it meant
The word and the bread is sent to red and fed at the letters and hesitant
I'm through with the keepin' shit in the closet
Trying to help a bitch, you knownin' nothing but garbage
How is music her solace when a lot of niggas she polished
Now they telling my goddess I put my dick in a hobbit, stop it
I'm never the type of nigga to ram noâ€” damn ho, the kinda bitch get you caught in a scandal
A jam though
Now you're deleted, treated like famo to spam so
Come to the land mo' and get ammo
Truth always stop the feces, but I pop the pieces
If they show up at the spot
The beast is gonna gun up on a chopper heat, bitch
'Cause she got facetious
Hella cruel, and it is not polices
We got on the fam
Did you stop at the spot on the whim
But the 'Zilla hit the block on the grim
With a Glock on a limb
And you don't wanna mock none of him
I'ma yack on my brim
[Hook: JL]
I'm not one of them
Shocked with a scam
Watching does not get it in
Possible opposition, talk and pretend
Throw rocks and then pocket his hand
I'm not one of them
Lost in the wind, caught sleepwalkin' the land
Poppin a xan, zombie mockin' a trend
Not what I offered to them
I'm not one of them
You thought I was a friend, then cock blocking the win
Not gonna stand, still but the obstacle been
Flocking a conflict again
I'm not one of them
You could turn an event, gun yeah - got one of them
Pop to defend, my shit cocked coming in
I'll set it off in the end
I'm not one of them2Embed
