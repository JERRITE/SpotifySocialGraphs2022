LA House Party Lyrics[Verse 1]
I went to a party in LA
Where all of the girls were too pretty for me
And everyone talking had nothing to say
Yeah, yeah
And all of the guys were so clich√©
Wearing Calvin Klein and knock-off Rays
Posting photos online to people they hate
Yeah, ayy-ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up in a house in the Hills? (House in the Hills)
Don't really care about who anyone is
All of this hype
Night of my life is this it?
[Chorus]
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
Keep your vodka on ice, while I disappear
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause these people are weird
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
Keep your vodka on ice, while I disappear
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause they're really weird

[Verse 2]
Play my favorite song, please DJ
Man, I miss the Kanye from 2008
Says the guy in the bomber off his face
And that's so LA

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up in a house in the Hills? (House in the Hills)
Don't really care about who anyone is
All of this hype
Night of my life is this it?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
Keep your vodka on ice, while I disappear
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause they're really weird
You might also like[Bridge]
And the lines in the bathrooms are insane
'Cause they're all powdering their brains
And all of their problems are the same
They're just way too cool (They're just way too cool)
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause these people are weird

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
Keep your vodka on ice, while I disappear
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause these people are weird
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
Keep your vodka on ice, while I disappear
I don't wanna live like, all these people here
'Cause they're really weird

[Outro]
(While I disappear)
And the lines in the bathrooms are insane (While I disappear)
'Cause they're all powdering their brains (While I disappear)
And all of their problems are the same (While I disappear)
They're just way too coolEmbed
