You Wouldnâ€™t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
Funny story, I forgot how much of a big fat mess you are
I've been busy doing science, it's been tons of fun so far
Everything clean, nothing on fire
All by myself, finally

[Chorus]
Things change when they don't replace your core
It feels so strange not to hate you anymore
But you wouldn't know, would you?
[Verse 2]
I was saying this to Batman; oh, he was here the other day
Maybe you know him, he's a big deal, but I don't think of him that way
He's just a friend, someone I trust
Someone who won't kill me

[Chorus]
I'm fine, just in case you think I'm not, I am
This time I'm better with the friends I've got
But you wouldn't know, would you?

[Bridge]
I don't mean for this to sting
I forgive you everything, you monster
I can guess the reasons why
You are never coming by for me

[Verse 3]
I should go, there's something happening that will make you wish you'd stayed
There's a party with a real cake, yes, it's real, a cake I made
Talking and fun, testing and fun
All of this fun without you

[Chorus]
Too bad you let it get so out of hand
How much we had; finally I understand
But you wouldn't know, would you?
You wouldn't know, would you?You might also like1Embed
