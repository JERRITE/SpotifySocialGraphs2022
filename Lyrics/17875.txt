Moonwalking in Calabasas Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ballin' since I was a jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits, I had a goal to get rich
Momma was strugglin' paying the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo, this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried that night, I admit that shit
'02 old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, then I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like "How you get that lit?"
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
Hand get numb when I hold that shit
Momma I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' that Benz and she live in LA
Tryna thank God but don't know what to say
Lot of square footage where DDG stay
Bought it in August I'm movin' in May
Hop out the foreigns and black is my race
No it's not rented, It's facts in the bank
[Pre-Chorus]
Spent four hunnid on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy, sleepy
Yeah, make me a wish no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini

[Chorus]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons

[Verse 2]
Bet when I drop, they don't post that shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow you'll owe me bitch
Humble ass nigga but I know I'm rich (Yeah, rich as fuck)
Fuck that shit I know I'm lit
If we beef I fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players' ain't in to that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
Then she had told me you bro-oke, that's tuff
I got a blicky it sit on my hippy cause L.A. is tricky
They tryna come get me
Bought some Balencis they don't even fit me
They 950, but fuck it no biggie
I'm with a biddie she tryna get busy
She kiss on my neck but I told her no hickey
Tryna get with me, I told her she silly
She just for the night cause my bitch is too pretty

Spent four hunnid on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy, sleepy
Yeah, make me a wish no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini

[Chorus]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons

[Outro]
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons
I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas3Embed
