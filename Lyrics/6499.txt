The Future Is Golden Lyrics[Intro]
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I can hardly wait for it
Pushing for a long time
Dreaming all my life for it
(Alright, alright)
Walking on a thin line
(Let's go)
[Refrain]
I still believe
I still believe
I'll get through the long night
I'm digging deep
I'm digging deep
Climbing to a new height

[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
When they shine a light down on you?
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
When they shine a light down on you?

[Chorus]
The future is golden
The future is gold
The future is golden
The future is gold
The future is gold
The future is golden

[Verse 2]
Slip into the moment
Yeah, I'm facing that mystery
It's my time to hold it
Can I makе history?

When they shine a light down on you?
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
Whеn they shine a light down on you?

[Chorus]
The future is golden
The future is gold
The future is golden
The future is gold
The future is gold
We can magic everyday that I got, all right
Automatic all the way to the top, all right
The future is golden
The future is gold
The future is gold
The future is golden

[Bridge]
Hey yo, let's go
Hey yo, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah ,nah
Hey yo, let's go
Hey yo, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah ,nah

I'm digging deep, I'm digging deep
Climbing to a new height
I still believe, I still believe
I'll get through the long night
I'm digging deep, I'm digging deep
Climbing to a new height
[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
When they shine a light down on you?

We can magic everyday that I got, all right
Automatic all the way to the top, all right
