I Jusswon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl I got nothing to lose
It's either you or I go home
You made it easy to choose
Been waiting for you for so long
Especially when you drive it on the floor
I can hold you down, just let me know
I just need to see a little more
So don't hide it, don't hide it

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you move so sexy
Hands up on your waist in the two door flexin'
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, it feels like
Baby girl, it feels like
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, I got nothing to lose
[Verse 2]
You know me better than most people
So, I'ma hold on to you na-na
And just let go of my ego
So tell me if you need a little more
I can hold you down, just let me know
Baby, all I wanna do is show you
So don't hide it, don't hide it

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you move so sexy
Hands up on your waist in the two door flexin'
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, it feels like
Baby girl, it feels like
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, it feels like
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I just won, I just won
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, it feels like
Something 'bout the way that you move so sexy
Hands up on your waist in the two door flexin'
I do it if it feels right, baby girl, it feels like
Baby girl, it feels like
Baby girl, it feels likeYou might also like4Embed
