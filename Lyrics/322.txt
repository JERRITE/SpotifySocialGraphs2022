Last Last Time LyricsEmpty parking lot, half a cigarette
I got it off the ground, so it's a little wet
I'm on the Southside, walking sideways
I got too drunk again
Now it's a cold night, kind of late this year
Plans made, the cops are gone, and we're out of here
But I need to catch my breath, cause it's 3am
And I still miss someone

This is the last last time
I beg the sun to shine
Addicted to a memory and it's killing me
This is the last last time
Now I should hide at home cause I can't drive
Everybody's calling me to see if I'm alive
They say they got a friend that I need to meet
And she's never heard of you

This is the last last time
I beg the sun to shine
Addicted to a memory and it's killing me

This is the last last time
I try to change your mind
I'm addicted to the misery and it's killing me
Yeah, it's killing meYou might also likeEmbed
