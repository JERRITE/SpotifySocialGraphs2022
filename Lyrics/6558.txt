I stand tall
Watch me fall (Watch me fall)
Watch me fall
Call after call
I'll cop it all, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Watch me fall (Watch me fall)
From these castle walls (Castle walls)
I'll stand tall (I'll stand tall)
Baby, watch me ball (Baby, watch me ball)
Call after call (Call after call)
Walk around the mall (Walk around the mall)
I'll cop it all (I'll cop it all)
Castle halls
[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Baby, I'm an asshole, walkin' through my castle
I can break your heart, baby, I know it's so fragile
Step inside my castle, we blowin' on that good dope
Put this in your nostril, baby, I got good blow
Fuck her then I vanish, disappear like magic
I live lavish, Gucci sheets all on my mattress
GothBoiClique, skrrt-skrrt in a black whip
Pullin' down her skirt, I know you want it, you can have it
Welcome to my castle, it's just me and you tonight
I think you're an angel, just a human in disguise
This is not rap, it's a goth lullaby
I'll be in your dreams every time that we get high
Lie, lie, lie, all you ever do is lie
Look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Watch me fall (Watch me fall)
From these castle walls (Castle walls)
I'll stand tall (I'll stand tall)
Baby, watch me ball (Baby, watch me ball)
Call after call (Call after call)
Walk around the mall (Walk around the mall)
I'll cop it all (I'll cop it all)
