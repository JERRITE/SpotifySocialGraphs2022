Truth Is Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel you, I ripped the last page out
I don't even get jealous when you mention other women
I don't, I don't
And I don't miss you, I'm doing better now
I don't even think of calling 'cause I never feel like talking
I don't, I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Need you
But I need you
[Chorus]
Truth is I'm dishonest
'Cause I'm always scared to get too deep
Truth is that I want this
'Cause I always see you in my sleep
Truth is that I love you, mmm
Even when I'm trying not to

[Verse 2]
When I touch me, I'm wanting someone else
I don't even think about you
Reminisce it, wish I had it
'Cause it wasn't even that good
Wasn't even that good

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget you
I can't forget you

[Chorus]
Truth is I'm dishonest
'Cause I'm always scared to get too deep
Truth is that I want this
'Cause I always see you in my sleep
Truth is that I love you, mmm (Truth is that I love you)
Even when I'm trying not to
You might also like[Bridge]
Need you
But I need you
Forget you
I can't forget you

[Chorus]
Truth is I'm dishonest
'Cause I'm always scared to get too deep
Truth is that I want this
'Cause I always see you in my sleep
Truth is that I love you, mmm
Even when I'm trying not to

[Outro]
Need you
But I need you
Forget you
I can't forget you3Embed
