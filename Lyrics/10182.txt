Blisters Lyrics[Intro (fast-forwarded)]
Welcome to Strings and bling would you like to take a seat? The Coolest Kid in Africa will be here and will be serving a lot of heat in just a second. May I take your bitch while you wait? We have everything that you don't, most of which is just some good ass music. Please don't get me wrong I'm not -

[Verse 1]
I was talking to God like I was talking to my bro
He said I gave you what you need to release your inner glow
I don't know if it was fear but I started feeling cold
Then I pushed myself to do it I found me a piece of gold yeah
Yeah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang)
Damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang), damn (gang, gang)
Gang, gang, gang, gang!
9-1-1 what the fuck? You too damn dope hands up
You too black too damn ghetto
Strings and Bling too many medals
Too much power for one Zulu man
That's why I'm out here acting a hooligan
I thank God for blessing me ngempumelelo yeah
[Chorus]
When I count my blisters, I count my blessings
Told God I get it
You are now my bestie
Pick me up my bestie
Don't put me down my bestie
Don't put me down my bestie
Don't put me down my bestie

[Verse 2]
Every scar came with a scandal but it's nothing Jiggy Jigga can't handle
Should I tell you I don't never introduce myself?
And it ain't cause I ain't got no manners
Have you ever seen a kid work harder than Nana
I ain't never had no nana
Niggas hating on me coz they don't matter
I'm jiggy Jesus in Balenciaga sandals
Now you know, now you know
I'm a goat on the low, I'm a pimp on the low
But I don't put my hand on a hoe
I've been to hell and back, got colder
I was on the dope skipping class like rope
Every single time I go home
I gotta put something on the stove
Count my motherfucking money, it's funny
I let it have a roast
It was all or nothing
And I be having gold
Lucky number four you got me through the cold
I'm the chosen one I know it I wrote it down in stone
Don't test my patience nigga please
It won't cost much to make you bleed
Watch your tone when you talking to me yeah
Watch your tone when you
You might also like[Chorus]
When I count my blisters I count my blessings
Told God I get it
You are now my bestie
Pick me up my bestie
Don't put me down my bestie
Don't put me down my bestie2Embed
