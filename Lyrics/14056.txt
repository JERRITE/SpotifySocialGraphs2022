In Transit LyricsFree from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to

And I'm free it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to

By the way she looked I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh thats all I got to say

By the way she looked I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh thats all I got to say
Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from the world
Where I built too many walls

By the way she looked I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh thats all I got to say

By the way she looked I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh I went too farYou might also like8Embed
