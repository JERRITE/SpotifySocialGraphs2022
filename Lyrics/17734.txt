ILL BLU

[Pre-Chorus: Bandokay, Aisa Renardus & Double Lz]
(I got the magic)
Top floor with a sweet one
She didn't even know that day man brang it
Or I'm in the alleyway with an addict
He likes my food 'cause I don't add magic (I got the magic)
Shawty love talk, can't hack it
Back it, now she wan' copy my jacket (Numbers don't lie, don't lie)
On tour, on stage, I had it
My jewels shinin' so lavish (Bow, bow)
[Chorus: Double Lz & Bandokay & Aisa Renardus]
Watch man vanish before man back it (Runner)
You would've thought that the yutes done (Magic)
Cats all like my food cah the ting set straight, and we don't use  (Magic)
T's in the trap, he can tell you 'bout cats and packs
And of course, he can tell you 'bout (Magic)
Bro-bro got that yute and he still ain't rubbed, guess he must use (Magic)

[Verse 1: Bandokay, Double Lz]
I told bro it's because of magic
But he's tellin' me it's straight juj (It's fucked)
I told bae that your ting set good
Give her ten out of ten for the way she looks (Ten)
My young boys shoulda read these books
Stays on a 1-2's, tryna find these crooks (Where they at?)
YOI in Feltham and crooks
And man ain't there for crashin' and jugs (Ai, bow)
She loves me and I love me too
Then I guess me and her are just alike (Yes)
I got green, got black, got white
When I chop that down, gotta run FaceTime
Fine, she knows we can't wine and dine
So she stays at home, what's mine is mine (Home body)
Me and bro got bine on bine
So get the four door, let's ride, let's ride (Bow, bow)

Numbers don't lie, don't lie
How many times you gotta know? (Ai, ai)

[Verse 2: Double Lz, Aisa Renardus]
Do it for my bro, won't do it for a friend (I won't)
Play your position, I'll say that again (Play it)
My shawty wants kisses and cuddles
But I wanna ride with spinners at ten (I do)
'Ments, everyone's bad with their friends
Hence, why they get put on the bench (Haha)
You ain't savin' these shots like Cech
If you don't move right then you're gonna get left (Left)
Ting from West, man press and bounce (Bounce)
Ouch, put my third leg in her mouth (Ai)
Up in the dance, she's shakin' her arse
That's me and my buss down steppin' out (Magic, buss down)
Listen, you know I gotta step in style
Opp block tour but there's feds about (Hot)
Should we stay low? One blend it out
Silent rides but the shh come loud (Ai, ai)
