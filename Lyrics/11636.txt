TranslationsPortuguÃªsIsombard Lyrics[Verse 1]
So what of you?
The fateful few
Should take them all
Government fall
So tell your family and friends
We'll keep it plain
Never again

[Chorus]
Well, if you can't walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then...
If you can't walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk...
[Verse 2]
I'll make it clear, you'll make it then
But never here, never again
So which one hangs police with gangs?
It's all the same, it's all the same
I met you here, but then you ran
You ran with fear, you fearless man
So tell your violent and tame that they will cry
Never again
