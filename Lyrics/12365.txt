Cold Blue Steel And Sweet Fire (2022 Remaster) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling, "You can't deny me
Now you know what you need"
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

[Chorus 1]
"Come with me, I know the way," she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Leave someone a letter?
You can come now or you can come later"
[Verse 2]
A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy black cracks of thе sky
"Pin-cushion-prick, fix this poor bad dreamer"
"Money" cold shadows rеply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors, spit-on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release

[Chorus 2]
"Come with me, I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
Does it really matter
If you come now or if you come later?"

[Verse 3]
Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging but it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

"Come with me, I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first?
I mean what does it really matter?
You're gonna come now or you're gonna come later"Embed
