The Way That She Loves Lyrics3 a.m., she'll call you up when she's lonely
She'll just drive, without a clue where she's goin'
She'll try to tell a joke, and get the punch line wrong
Forget all the words, to her own favorite song
And when she walks into the room, she'll set it alight
And she'll always be on your side

That's just the way that she loves
That's just the way that she moves you
She'll take you higher than high
Boy you can try, just know you won't ever get enough
That's just the way that she loves, woah
Well she's gonna cry, before the credits start rolling
She's gonna give you her heart, woah
And it's gonna feel like you've stole it
Ah, she'll have her hair pulled back, and your t-shirt on
Won't need to take a picture, cause after she's gone
Yeah you still remember you're gonna be
Thinking of her every minute all night long

That's just the way that she loves
That's just the way that she moves you
She'll take you higher than high
Boy you can try, just know you won't ever get enough
She's gonna set you on fire
She's gonna light up your midnight
And if you lose her she's always
Silhouette in the hallway, the one you can't stop thinking of
That's just the way that she loves

That's just the way that she loves
That's just the way that she moves you
Well she'll take you higher than high
Boy you could try, just know you won't ever get enough
She's gonna set you on fire
She's gonna light up your midnight
And if you get to hold her, don't ever let her go
She's something like a sunset, turning everything to gold
That's just the way that she loves
Woah
That's just the way that she loves
Yeah
That's just the way that she lovesYou might also likeEmbed
