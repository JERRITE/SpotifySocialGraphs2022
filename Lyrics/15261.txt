Rosarito LyricsWell i drove down south to heaven if you know what i mean
If i had to do it over, then i wouldn't change a thing
Whoa oh oh lord take me down to mexico, rosarito, baja california
Goin to school and workin on the weekend
I finally saved enough to buy a car
Got some bros out there all goin surfin
But you know that ill be chillin at the bar
Two shots of tequilla my skin is turnin red
Every thing is just beautiful til it popped in to my head
Life is good and life is fun, but it isnt that way for everyone, no
Ask that kid for chicklets, tin sombraroes on his head
Sellin blankets knives and jewelry to keep a roof above his head
Take take me down to mexico, rosarito, baja california
Whoa oh oh lord take me down to mexico, rosarito, baha california
Things you said last night down by the fire side
It didn't seem to mean much the next day
Bottle rocket flew up
A bunch of people threw up
I looked at my man ENO and this is what he said
They say life is good and they say life is fun
But it sure ain't that way for everyone
Well i crossed the boarder just to change my scene
???????????????????????????????????????
Down there across the boarder where the money's not green
Tequila, beer, ecstasy, and mescaline
One thing remains true the water's still blue
You know what to do
Get some
Well i drove up north from heaven
And i heard from what ive seen
If i had to do it over i wouldn't change a thingYou might also likeEmbed
