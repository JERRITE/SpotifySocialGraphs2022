Je M’appelle (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Benzz, French Montana & Tion Wayne]
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance (You know what it is)
Je m'appelle, man's Benz (Mm-mm)
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France (You hear that)
Ha, Benzz

[Chorus: Benzz]
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dancе
Je m'appelle, man's Bеnz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost, yo
[Verse 1: Benzz & Tion Wayne]
All the beef, can't dead all that
Double it, triple it, bubble it
Ripple it, cuddle it, dribble it, uh, uh
Seen a bad girl jugglin' it, trickle it (Yo)
'Nuff badman, so I'm comin' in─ (Mm-mm)
Wait there, let me pause my FIFA
Je m'appelle T-Wizzy, really
Had to shoot shot like Karim Benzema
That boy like Harry Maguire
Had a good girl, can't protect his keeper (De Gea)
Doggy that, nice gyal a cheater
Everybody knows I'm the platinum feature (Mm-mm)
Yo, lovin' it, sit on it, bruckin' it, liffin' it
I ain't even put it all in she— (Uh, uh)
Real 9 boy charts, now I'm killin' it
Even when I had dead weed, got rid of it
Choppin' it, swingin' it, chingin' it, hittin' it
Free big A, Edmonton, Ibrahimović
Pretty in my Lambo, make a gun-man dance
Je m'appelle T-Wayne, need a gyal from France

[Chorus: Benzz, Tion Wayne & French Montana]
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance (Baow)
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost (Montana)
Yo

Shorty got no waist
Shooters got no face, shoes got no lace
Ice on my wrist watch, Rollie don't tick tock
Diamonds dance like tick box (Woo)
Fifty on pinky, yo' ting wanna link me
Ten mill with a ink me
Shorty got flavor
She don't wanna be saved, so please don't save her
Shorty got deep throat
From the bottom, they know she coke, coke boys on Sea Slope
Fillers on acid, plug the beat in the casket
In the field with the trash
Shor-shorty got a G, oh
I need space like Elon Musk, can I bust? (Baow)
Yeah, the Moroccan boys, undefeated like Floyd
Red and green colors
Je m'appelle Montana, totin' that hammer
Please no cameras (Baow, baow, baow)

[Chorus: Benzz]
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'a-Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost
[Outro: Benzz & Natasja]
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'a-Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost
