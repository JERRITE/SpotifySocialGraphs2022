Young Right Now Lyrics[Intro]
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
Are we young right now, are we young right now?

[Verse 1]
Take my wishes away
I no longer need them
I no longer need them
Bury my hopes and dreams
I no longer need them
I no longer need them
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Long ago, we could leave our lives
Now we're wondering how

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say

[Verse 2]
Maybe one day we'll fly
And take back freedom
And take back freedom
We shouldn't be scare to fight
If we don't believe them
No longer believe them

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know how to free my mind
When there's no way out
Way too long we've been asking how
Are we young right now?

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we young right now, are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, oh
Are we young right now?
We say, ohEmbed
