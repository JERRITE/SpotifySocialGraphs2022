​i＜3u Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm looking at my tears
Falling down the world
Falling down like leaves
Crashing into you
My eyes are still and clear
I think it's over you
Forgetting how it feels
Forever missing you

[Chorus]
I like you, I like you
I like you, I like you so
I like you here, I like you
I like you, I like you so
[Verse 2]
You're love's just like a stream
Of never ending blue
Memories from a dream
That I get to surround you
Is it never what it seems
Is it never really true
If I'm facing all my fears
Could I ever rest in you

[Chorus]
I like you (crush, crush), I like you (crush)
I like you, I like you so
I like you here (crush), I like you (crush)
I like you, I like you so

[Outro]
Here
Crush, crush
Ooh
Here
Crush, crush
