Bodmon Lyrics[Intro]
Sweet 16
Sweet 16

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna be my wife
Cause I beat it out the park
Smoking weed and staying high (high-igh)
Partying 'til after dark

[Verse 1]
She want pipe then cuddlin'
Girl, I got the piece for your puzzle in
Now these hoes buzzing in
Cause I'm buzzing like bumble bee
Say I need to humble me
Who b- who believed in me
Me, AJ and Jeffery
We really are soaring for my Akhis struggling
Ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed but my chain and my change
Girl what you saying? I'm still the same, I'm just in the game
[Chorus]
Shawty wanna be my wife (no way)
Cause I beat it out the park (José)
Smoking weed and staying high (high-igh)
Partying 'til after dark
Shawty wanna be my wife (no way)
Cause I beat it out the park (José)
Smoking weed and staying high (high-igh)
Partying 'til after dark

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no saqajaan, but this Henny that I'm on got me hella sakran
I'm no modmon, but these drugs that I'm on, so I keep my shades on
(I'm a bodmon)
Girl I'm only twenty-one, I'm just tryna have some fun
(I'm a bodmon)
I'm MIA out in LA nobody knows where I stay

[Verse 2]
Baby I see you, sweet and spicy too
Girl the way you move, got me feeling you
The way she twists and turns like hulahoop
Got some things I wanna do to you
Show me what that booty do, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Shawty wanna be my wife (no way)
Cause I beat it out the park (José)
Smoking weed and staying high (high-igh)
Partying 'til after dark
Shawty wanna be my wife (no way)
Cause I beat it out the park (José)
Smoking weed and staying high (high-igh)
Partying 'til after dark

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no saqajaan, but this Henny that I'm on got me hella sakran
I'm no modmon, but these drugs that I'm on, so I keep my shades on
(I'm a bodmon)
Girl I'm only twenty-one, I'm just tryna have some fun
(I'm a bodmon)

[Outro]
I play like bossa nova
I need my baby, come over
Rich bitch in a cocaine Range Rover
Salty when a Sweeterman slide through
With my clan when we ride through
She like me, but she wife'd you
Pussy fat and its tight too
Mami call me papi in Miami
My baby call me daddy out in Cali
(Quiero que sepas que soy tuya
Que sepas que me interesa)10Embed
