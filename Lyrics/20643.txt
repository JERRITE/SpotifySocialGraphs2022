Would It Make You Feel Better? Lyrics[Intro]
Would it make you feel better, better, better?
Would it make you feel better, better, better, better?

[Verse 1]
It's been so long, I've been meanin' to write you back
But I get whiplash when I'm thinkin' about the past
It felt the realest a minute before the crash
Wastin' away together, like we're expensive trash

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see that you didn't move on
And I wanna just keep playin' along
But would it make you feel better?
Would it make you feel better, better, better?
[Chorus]
Would it make you feel better if I said I was wrong?
If I gave you my body when the lovin' is gone?
Would it make you feel better, better, better?
Would it make you feel better?

[Verse 2]
Now that we're here, gotta look into the mirror
It's the last year that I operate in fear
Felt the realest a minute before the crash
Wastin' away together, like we're expensive trash

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see that you didn't move on
And I wanna just keep playin' along
But would it make you feel better?
Would it make you feel better, better, better?

[Chorus]
Would it make you feel better if I said I was wrong?
If I gave you my body when the lovin' is gone?
Would it make you feel better, better, better?
Would it make you feel better? (Better, better)
Would it make you feel better if I said I was fine?
All the secrets we're keeping wouldn't eat us alive
Would it make you feel better, better, better?
Would it make you feel better? (Better, better)

Would it make you feel better, better, better? (Would it make you feel? Would it make you feel?)
Would it make you feel better, better, better? (Would it make you feel? Would it make you feel?)
Would it make you feel better, better, better? (Would it make you feel? Would it make you feel?)
Would it make you feel better, better, better? (Would it make you feel? Would it make you feel?)
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, betterEmbed
