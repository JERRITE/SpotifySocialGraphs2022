Alcohol (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1 : Sky Blu]
DUI, no not I
No way to fly, bitch I'm sky
I take shots like a 9 to 5
I make it, make it, make it rain like a thousand times
Yep I'm a vulture when she dances
I swoop down and then she can see I'm handsome
Wings on the whip we can fly the coupe
Got drink, what you trynna do ? (what you trynna do ?)

[Pre-hook : Sky Blu & The Girl]
Hey boy, can you fill my cup ? Boy, can you fill my cup ?
(what you trynna do ?)
Yeah girl, you can drink with us ! But you gotta drink it up !
(what you trynna do ?)
Hey boy, can you fill my cup ? Boy, can you fill my cup ?
(what you trynna do ?)
Yeah girl, you can drink with us ! But you gotta drink it up !
[Hook : Sky Blu & The Cataracs]
Drink u-u-u-up, drink u-u-u-up

Drink u-u-u-up, drink u-u-u-up
Drink u-u-u-up, drink. Alcohol !

[Verse 2 : The Cataracs]
Oh snap, what do I do ?
The girl of my dreams came into view
Plan A, I could play it cool
But I pick plan B cuz I'm off that brew
I said look here girl I been around the world
You got the right credentials
I didnt make the cut to be a doctor but
I got some nice utensils

[Pre-hook : Sky Blu & The Girl]
Hey boy, can you fill my cup ? Boy, can you fill my cup ?
(what you trynna do ?)
Yeah girl, you can drink with us ! But you gotta drink it up !
(what you trynna do ?)
Hey boy, can you fill my cup ? Boy, can you fill my cup ?
(what you trynna do ?)
Yeah girl, you can drink with us ! But you gotta drink it up !
