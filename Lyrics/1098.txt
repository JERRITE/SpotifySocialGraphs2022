TranslationsEspa√±olRunning Out (Stripped) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't have the time to
Wait for a breakthrough
I'm tired of losing patience with you
It's a cycle of pain we've been through, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't hate you
But I can't save you
Once again I'm stuck here in the middle of
Wanting to let go, needing to keep hold
There's no end
And once again you walk in
[Chorus]
And I'm running out
Out of time, out of breath, out of space
Out of words, out of things I can say
Out of hope, yeah, 'cause you never change
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out
Out of places to hide in my head
Out of ways to forgive what you said
It's a fight and I've got no defence
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out
And I'm running out

[Verse 2]
Promise comes freely, broken too easy
Don't show me feelings that you never meant
They're just letters that you never sent, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't hate you
But I can't save you
Once again I'm stuck here in the middle of
Wanting to let go, needing to keep hold
There's no end
And once again you walk in
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'm running out
Out of time, out of breath, out of space
Out of words, out of things I can say
Out of hope, yeah, 'cause you never change
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out
Out of places to hide in my head
Out of ways to forgive what you said
It's a fight and I've got no defence
Once again you walk in, yeah

[Bridge]
Somethings are better left forgotten
Some things you wish you didn't want them
Take you to hell and back again, oh, no, no
'Cause I can't hate you
But I can't save you, no
Wanting to hold back, needing to let go
Oh, so I'm running out

[Chorus]
Out of time, out of breath, out of space
Out of words, out of things I can say
Out of hope, yeah, 'cause you never change
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out
Out of places to hide in my head
Out of ways to forgive what you said
It's a fight and I've got no defence
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out, oh, no
[Outro]
Once again you walk in
And I'm running out, oh, yeah
I'm running out, running out3Embed
