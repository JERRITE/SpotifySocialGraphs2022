All Rise Lyrics[Intro: Simon]
Yo, yo
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Simon]
Your honour, please, gotta believe what I say
What I will tell, happened just the other day
I must confess, cause I've had about enough
I need your help, gotta make this here thing stop

[Pre-Chorus: Lee & Antony]
Baby, I swear I'll tell the truth (Uh-huh)
About all the things we used to do (C'mon)
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now, objection overruled (Here we go)
Oh baby
[Chorus:All,Duncan & Antony]
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise, all rise (All rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)

[Verse 2: Duncan & Simon]
You're on the stand, with your back against the wall
Nowhere to run, and nobody you can call (Oh no)
I just can't wait, now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray, but the jury will decide

[Pre-Chorus: Lee  & Antony]
Baby, I swear I'll tell the truth (Uh-huh)
About all the things we used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled (C'mon)
I'm telling you now, objection overruled
Oh baby

[Chorus:All,Antony & Lee ft Duncan]
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied
All rise (All rise)
All rise (Oh oh, all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)

So step back, cause you don't know this cat
I know deep down that, you don't want me to react
I lay low, leaving all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house, you find that your stuff has gone
But in reality, to whom does the stuff belong?
I bring you into court, to preach my order
And you know that you overstepped the border (Uh-huh)

[Chorus 1: All,Lee]
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied (Ooo)
All rise, all rise (C'mon)
Three for the calls you've been making (Yeah yeah)
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise, all rise

[Chorus 2:All & Antony]
One for the money (What'cha say) and the free rides
It's two for the (Can't you pay?) lie that you denied
All rise (What you've done)
All rise
Three for the calls (What'cha say) you've been making
It's four for the (Can't you pay?) times you've been faking
All rise (What you've done)
All rise (Where you've gone)
[Outro:All,Lee & Duncan & Antony]
One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lie that you denied (Oh oh)
All rise (Oh oh)
(All rise)
All rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking (I said all rise)
All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)6Embed
