Ironbound LyricsOne by one, doing the crime
Never thought twice, never did time
Never turn back, never go home
Never get used to being alone

One by one, into the sea
Too many eyes are staring at me
Two by two, you watch as they go
And who are you and
What do you know?
Got your heart in my hand
Never let go

Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
This is what you make it
Pound the ground
Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
How far can you take it?
As you go ironbound

One by one, iron to bend
Keeping the oath, right to the end
Three by three, breaking some bones
Snapping some neck, never alone
Here they come, rumble and pound
Never get used to hearing that sound
There they go, fast as they came
Never go back, never the same

Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
This is what you make it
Pound the ground
Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
How far can you take it?
As you go ironbound

All my friends are right
All my friends are automatic
They all rule the night

All my friends are thick and thin
They've loyalty and heart
My friends put me back together
When I fall apart

Say all my friends are green and black
Everyone alright
All my friends are automatic
They all rule the night

One by one, doing the crime
Never thought twice, never did time
Never turn back, never go home
Never get used to being alone

One by one, into the sea
Too many eyes are staring at me
Two by two, you watch as they go
Who are you?
I wanna know
Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
This is what you make it
Pound the ground
Make it, never let go
Take it, tell all you know
How far can you take it?
As you go ironbound
