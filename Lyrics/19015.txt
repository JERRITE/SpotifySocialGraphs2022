Invincible Force LyricsI'm an invincible force of evil
My eternal hatred is destructive
There's no chance to survive
I incarnate the end of mankind

I'm in crest of human flesh
And I agonize in a pool of blood
Don't try to escape or resist
Cause christ won't help you tonight

[Chorus]
Invincible Force!
Invincible Force!
You break down in the morass
Turn and see them blood stained claws
Now i tear the shreds out of your face
Now you will curse your day of birth

You agonize in a pool of blood
You scream out and begg for mercy
Don't try to escape or resist
Cause Christ won't help you tonight

[Chorus]
Invincible Force!
