When It All Falls Apart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm having the day from hell
It was all going so well (Before you came)
And you told me you needed space
With a kiss on the side my face (Not again)
And not to mention (The tears I shed)
But I shoulda kicked your (Ass instead)
I need intervention
Attention to stop temptation to scream
'Cause, baby...
[Chorus]
Everything is f'ed up straight from the heart
Tell me: what do you do, when it all falls apart?
Gotta pick myself up; where do I start?
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart
No

[Verse 2]
Don't know where I parked my car
Don't know who my real friends are (Anymore)
I put my faith in you
What a stupid thing to do (When it rains it pours)
And not to mention (I drank too much)
I'm feeling hung over (And out of touch)
I need intervention
Attention to stop temptation to scream
Baby...

[Chorus]
Everything is f'ed up straight from the heart
Tell me: what do you do, when it all falls apart?
Gotta pick myself up; where do I start?
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart
No

[Bridge]
Can it be easier? Can I just change my life?
'Cause it just seems to go bad every time
Will I be mending?
Another one ending once again
You might also like[Chorus]
Everything is f'ed up straight from the heart
Tell me: what do you do, when it all falls apart?
Gotta pick myself up; where do I start?
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart
No
Everything is f'ed up straight from the heart
Tell me: what do you do, when it all falls apart?
Gotta pick myself up; where do I start?
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart (Falls apart)
Gotta pick myself up 'cause things are messed up
Everything is f'ed up straight from the heart
Tell me: what do you do, when it all falls apart?
Gotta pick myself up; where do I start?
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apartEmbed
