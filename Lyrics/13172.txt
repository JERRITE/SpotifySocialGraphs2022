​papi bones Lyrics[Intro: Kaner Flex, Movie Star Johnny]
Let me tell you somethin', yeah
Gyal that can wine, or gyal—
Ah, who dis people? You know it's Movie Star Johnny
UK dancehall general
And right now, me ah gon' introduce ah song
Weh ah guh tek over di wol' place
We ah guh ram the dance floor
FKA twigs! Shygirl! Play di song!
See di song, yah, people, see di song, yah
Let me tell you somethin', yeah
Gyal that can wine, or gyal that can dance
And I just meanin', like, she just let—
Lets herself be free and so expressive and just don't give a fuck
Uh, there's nothing more sexier than that
[Verse 1: FKA twigs]
Truth stay, vibe never realer
Got that Capri' Sun energy, yeah
There's a grind up on in your area
Let's start it again
Boom, boom, take us when you can't find the ones
But everybody wants to send out for my love
Sticky, sweet, I'm gonna be like a killer
A killer, a killer

[Chorus: FKA twigs]
Don't stop, don't stop
Papi, papi, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Switch it up, but don't stop
I'ma, I'ma
Throw it like a tantrum
Don't stop, don't stop
Papi, papi
Let's start it again (Papi)

[Verse 2: Shygirl, FKA twigs, Both]
Strong grip gripping on my body
You can hold it
Never stop, I ain't met no body, no
Who control this
Not enough, just a little more
Guess you want this
Eyes wide shut, we can rock till the morning
Papi got an itch I could pacify (Tap, tap, tap)
Tell me when, tell me where
I can read your body fine
Got that Capri' Sun energy, yeah
Got that Capri' Sun energy, yeah

Don't stop, don't stop
Switch it up, but don't stop

Throw it like a tantrum
Don't stop, don't stop
Papi, papi
Let's start it again (Papi)

[Bridge: FKA twigs]
Oh, you're so damn fine
We bump and grind and twirl (And twirl)
The champagne bubble up (Bubble)
My champagne bubble girl
Oh, you're so damn fine
We bump and grind and twirl (And twirl)
The champagne bubble up (Bubble)
My champagne bubble girl

[Verse 3: Shygirl & FKA twigs, FKA twigs, Movie Star Johnny, Kaner Flex]
FKA twigs, Jamaica, England, rrah
Don't stop, backtrack if you wanna tap dat
Real steady, in fact, can you even handle that?
My gyal never lack, simmer for the season
Spicy hot body, ready for the evening
Don't feel like I could be with a girl if she can't dance
Let's start it again
[Chorus: FKA twigs]
Don't stop, don't stop
Papi, papi, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Switch it up, but don't stop
I'ma, I'ma
Throw it like a tantrum
Don't stop, don't stop
Papi, papi
Let's start it again (Papi)

[Outro: FKA twigs]
Oh, you so damn fine
We bump and grind and twirl
The champagne bubble up
My champagne bubble girl
Oh you’re so damn fine
We bump and grind and twirl
The champagne bubble up
My champagne bubble girl9Embed
