Be Your Drug LyricsI just want to be your drug
I want to be your
I just want to be your drug
I want to be your

Good morning love
How do you do?
I brush my teeth before I talk to you
We fell asleep
Inside this room
Drinking rum to our favourite tunes
Now I’m alone
Where did you go?
I’m lying down just to take it slow
And everyday
That we don’t meet
You need a fix of good old me

‘Cause I just want to be your drug
I want to be your
I just want to be your drug
I want to be your
I just want to be your drug
I want to be your
I just want to be your drug
I want to be your

Now every night
Inside my head
You dance around like a silhouette
I think I’m hooked
So reel me in
And let the games begin

And so we go
Not very far
We found ourselves in an English bar
You said to me
If I don’t stay
You’ll get your fix in a different way
You might also like‘Cause I just want to be your drug
I want to be your

I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your

I just want to be your drug

And I can’t decide
If it’s wrong, or it’s right
But I won’t deny myself

I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be your

I just want to be your drug, I want to be your
I just want to be your drug, I want to be yourI just want to be your drug, I want to be yourI just want to be your drug, I want to be yourEmbed
