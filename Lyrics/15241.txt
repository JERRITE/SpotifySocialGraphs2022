Hit the City Lyrics[Verse 1]
The dog descends through the promised land
Down kingdom come and the acid bath
I'm Babylon burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city

[Verse 2]
In Maryanne I dug a hole
And watched her trip on my hollow soul
Then in the end
All that crawled was my skin
I couldn't kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city
[Verse 3]
The ghost arrives at his bitter end
To the promised land then the dog descends
I'm Babylon burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city

[Coda]
