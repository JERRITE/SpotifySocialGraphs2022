We Did Not Make Sense Lyrics[Verse 1: Presence]
Everybody asking me about you, and I play it off like I don’t really care you left
They ask me how I feel
And I pretend it isn’t real
'Cause in my heart I’m feeling uncontrollable amounts of stress
The easiest way
For me to ease all of the pain
Is to pretend
That none of it exists at all
And so I go about my days
Tryna stay away
From anything that might lead me to call
'Cause
I don’t wanna break my heart again and
I don’t wanna say you're just friend
I know we knew someday we’d end
But now it’s here, and I’m a mess
I’m sitting here with these regrets
Thinking of things I never said
I knew before this was ahead
But now I'm here and I’m a wreck
[Chorus: Presence & Wovy]
Everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?
Oh, everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?
Oh, everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?

[Verse 2: Presence]
The questions keep on coming in
I don’t know how to answer them
When people asking where you been
'Cause I don’t even know what it made it break
A culmination of mistakes on the sides of each of our ends
We both knew that we had nothing in common
And that’s what made it uncommon
The bond that we had at first
But slowly we would grow in new directions
And lose track of what a blessing it was
To have each other
Now

[Chorus: Presence & Wovy]
Oh, everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?
Oh, everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?
Yeah, everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?

Everyone keeps asking me about you
About you
How do I explain that we did not make sense?Embed
