Dirty Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know what you like
Get the champagne
Hands on your thighs
Wanna get your body high
Get low
Or no
I know you wanna fight
Set a new pace
Wanna do you right
Keep your back to the sky
Go slow
Or no
[Chorus]
Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I and my dirty mind
We can stay high or no?
Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I could die a thousand times
We can stay high or no?

Let me change your mind
Give you new fame
Make you feel shy
Keep it fifty all night
Let go
Or no
We can let it ride
Play a new game
Heavy overtime
We can do it for life
Go pro
Or no

Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I and my dirty mind
We can stay high or no?
Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I could die a thousand times
We can stay high or no?
You might also like[Bridge]
We can Stay high for life, or tell me to go
No No
Do you want it or no?
We can Stay high for life, or tell me to go, no
No No
Do you want me or no?
No No No

[Chorus]
Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I and my dirty mind
We can stay high or no?
Yes or Yes?
Do you want it in?
You wanna be stressed, I’d rather have sex
You and I could die a thousand times
Or we can stay high or no?1Embed
