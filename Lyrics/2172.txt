TranslationsEspa√±olJust Wanna Be With You Lyrics[Intro: Ryan]
Mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 1: Ryan, with Kelsey]
I got a lot of things I have to do
All these distractions, our future's comin' soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens, I know I've got you
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart
[Chorus: Troy & Gabriella, Troy]
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothin' we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothin' can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you

[Interlude: Gabriella & Troy]
Yeah, yeah (Just be with you)
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
You know how life can be, it changes overnight
It's sunny, then rainin', but it's alright
A friend like you always makes it easy
I know that you get me every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything, you can count on me

[Chorus: Troy & Gabriella, Troy]
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothin' we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothin' can break us apart (You know it's true)
I just wanna be with you
