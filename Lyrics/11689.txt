Being so Normal Lyrics[Verse 1]
'Is this on?'
She said, with unblinking eyes
In the front yard when we stepped outside
'You're alright'
I thought I heard her say to me
But I was freaked 'cause I saw Chuck kiss Livy Jeanne

[Chorus]
Sometimes I can still see you
Just like I used to
But I grew my hair
And you got tattoos
And man, that's hard to look through
[Verse 2]
Somebody took the piss right out of me
For the last time right before that Halloween
Who was that, on the stair before the dance?
And why do you go and say that this could never last?

[Chorus]
Sometimes I can still see you
Just like I used to
But I grew my hair
And you got tattoos
And man, that's hard to look throughYou might also like4Embed
