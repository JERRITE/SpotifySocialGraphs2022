One Question Lyrics[Intro]
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis
So them names stay, them names stay

[Chorus]
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin' with me)
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis
So them dames stay fucking with me
I can't complain, I got a mug she can love for a very long time
And I'm pretty damn good in the sheets (love her, love her)
Got balls so big you ain't even gotta ask
Get your fine ass up in the seat
[Verse 1]
Now little lady, may I ask you a question?
My shit gets to flexin'
In every direction there's sexual tension
Back to the question, and with some discretion
I have this erection that needs some attention
The spandex neglected to stay in its section
Now I cannot stand up until I'm ejected
I need some protection, I don't do infections
It's not a suggestion, let's contra those ceptives
(I go) So hard I don't know better, dog
Beefin' with myself so I'll probably get a bodyguard
Hit 'em with the audio, we be at the Mardi Gras
Other side of town, we get down with the all of y'all
(Bounce!) Hop to it if you really need a quick fix
Spit game quicker than an Eagle with a pick 6
(Okay) Got it on my list for next Christmas
Santa finally caught himself a motherfucking sneak diss

[Chorus]
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin' with me)
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis (aah!)
So them dames stay fucking with me
I can't complain, I got a mug she can love for a very long time
And I'm pretty damn good in the sheets (love her, love her)
Got balls so big you ain't even gotta ask
Get your fine ass up in the seat

Now little mama, I'ma ask you just one question
Please don't tell me no lie
I've been around this block
More than once, more than twice
Now little mama, I'ma
Work you all something really special if you want it
Got a hundred different ways that I can get your ass to cumming
No fronting, I'm blunted
After work, we can cuddle
I'm the big spoon, you're the little spoon in the cupboard
I love it, you can dub it
And handle it how you want it
With the dubble, there's no trouble
Twerking is undiscovered
Hell yeah, out to bubble and double up on the subtle
Find the baby, I don't bumble, and settle up in the suburbs

[Chorus]
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin' with me)
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis
So them dames stay fucking with me
I can't complain, I got a mug she can love for a very long time
And I'm pretty damn good in the sheets (love her, love her)
Got balls so big you ain't even gotta ask
Get your fine ass up in the seat
[Verse 3]
Bring that old up right out
Tell your friends in the back to get up right now
We got that new soul, Two Tone is up right now
And I'm a Philly Philly bull, so you love that sound
And I'ma make sure you love it
Damn sure you love it
Goddamn, you're best to me
No crabs in the bucket, we all cousins
And we stand making history
No, Lord, I know

[Chorus]
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin' with me)
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis
So them dames stay fucking with me
I can't complain, I got a mug she can love for a very long time
And I'm pretty damn good in the sheets (love her, love her)
Got balls so big you ain't even gotta ask
Get your fine ass up in the seat
I'm a Northeast spitter with a big-sized cap
And them lames ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin' with me)
Got brains, got brawn, got a dog named Lewis
So them dames stay fucking with me
I can't complain, I got a mug she can love for a very long time
And I'm pretty damn good in the sheets (love her, love her)
Got balls so big you ain't even gotta ask
Get your fine ass up in the seat1Embed
