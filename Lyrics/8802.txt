Love Is the Drug Lyrics[Instrumental]

Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't break free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug Im thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Love is the drug Im thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug, got a hook in me
Oh oh catch that buzzYou might also likeEmbed
