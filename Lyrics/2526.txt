Hurt for Long Lyrics[Verse 1: Sergio Calderon]
Gonna be some nights when you try to fall asleep
But it's not easy
Hope you tell yourself that it’s not your fault
Yeah, yeah
Your favorite pair of shoes, a ring or two
Those are things you don't go back for
Don't give him an excuse to see you at all

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos]
Drunk dialing you at a quarter past two
Saying he’s made a mistake
Saying there's nobody better for you
He doesn't know I'm on the way
[Chorus: Chance Perez]
Don't you think for a minute he's irreplaceable
I know he hurt you but it won't hurt for long, hurt for long
He thinks you're out of options, you’re ’bout to prove him wrong
'Cause I’m right here making sure you don't hurt for long, hurt for long
Hurt for long, hurt for long
Hurt for long, hurt for long

[Verse 2: Drew Ramos]
I'll make you forget all the pain all the stress that he left on you
Every single second I pull you close, yeah, yeah
I know you were loyal, he was spoiled
All the things he took for granted
Those are all the things that I love the most

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos, Michael Conor, Brady Tutton]
Now he's drunk dialing you at a quarter past two
Saying he’s made a mistake
Saying there's nobody better for you
But it's already too late (But it's too late)

[Chorus: Chance Perez, Drew Ramos]
Don't you think for a minute he's irreplaceable
I know he hurt you but it won't hurt for long, hurt for long
He thinks you're out of options, you're 'bout to prove him wrong
Cause I'm right here making sure you don't hurt for long, hurt for long (Ayy)
Hurt for long, hurt for long (Ayy, yeah)
Hurt for long, hurt for long
Hurt for long, hurt for long
'Cause I'm right here making sure you don't hurt for long, hurt for long

Make it feel like it's all in the past
Like it never even happened, never even happened
Make it feel like it's all in the past
Like it never even happened, never even happened

[Chorus: Chance Perez, Brady Tutton, Drew Ramos]
Don't you think for a minute, he's irreplaceable
(Don't you think for, placeable)
I know he hurt you but it won't hurt for long, hurt for long (Hurt for long)
He thinks you're out of options, you're 'bout to prove him wrong
'Cause I'm right here making sure you don't hurt for long, hurt for long (Hey)
Hurt for long, hurt for long (Making sure you don't)
Hurt for long, hurt for long (Making sure you don't)
Hurt for long, hurt for long (Yeah)
'Cause I'm right here making sure you don't hurt for long, hurt for long2Embed
