Nothing Feels Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
Count the seconds, catch my breath
Feelings come and go again
Count my blessings, hope they hear me too, too
Trapped inside this spider web
Scared of life and scared of death
Trapped inside these walls I built of doom, doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you let me, won’t you let me through? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Don't regret me even when I do
[Chorus]
I've been calling out for someone
Mouth around the gun
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
All the pain gets trapped in my lungs
Drowning in my blood
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right

[Post-Chorus]
Is it a lost fight?
Or is it a long drive home?
Long drive home

[Verse 2]
Lost what I’ve been dreaming of
One eye open, one eye shut
Lost the only ones I'll ever love, yeah
My reflection beats me up
Smiling as I take that punch
My reflection is my favorite drug, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you let me, won't you let me through? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Don't regret me even when I do
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been calling out for someone
Mouth around the gun
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
All the pain gets trapped in my lungs
Drowning in my blood
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right

[Post-Chorus]
Is it a lost fight
Out on the front line?
Will I watch the sunrise
As I take the long drive home?

[Bridge]
Long drive home
Long drive home
Long drive home

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I've been calling out for someone
Mouth around the gun
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
All the pain gets trapped in my lungs
Drowning in my blood
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
Nothing feels right
[Post-Chorus]
Is it a lost fight
Out on the front line?
Will I watch the sunrise
As I take the long drive home?Embed
