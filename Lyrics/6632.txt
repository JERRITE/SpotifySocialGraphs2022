Ready Set Letâ€™s Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
No pain, no victory
Your reign is history
'Cause we're not stoppin' 'til we break through
So take your best shot, make your move

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, step right up, who's next?
You're messin' with the best

[Chorus]
We're death defyin'
Coming in like lightnin'
Look out, we're strikin'
Ready set, ready set let's go
This fire's blazin'
We're troublemakin'
We got you shakin'
Ready set, ready set let's go
Go oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Go oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Ready set, ready set let's go
[Verse 2]
High volts through these veins
Trouble is our gain
Keepin' aces up every sleeve
Bringing rivals down to their knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, step right up, who's next?
You're messin' with the best

[Chorus]
We're death defyin'
Coming in like lightnin'
Look out, we're strikin'
Ready set, ready set let's go
This fire's blazin'
We're troublemakin'
We got you shakin'
Ready set, ready set let's go
Go oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Go oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Go oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh
Ready set, ready set let's go

[Bridge]
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up, hit 'em up
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
