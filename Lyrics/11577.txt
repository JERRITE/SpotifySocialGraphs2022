Is There Something In The Movies? Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're in a tin box and I've got a toothpick
And I have been poking the air
Somebody gave you a knife for your birthday
I think I know who, but it's not my affair

[Verse 2]
So I dance down the street like I'm Miss Angelina
My legs are so grounded and strong
And I'm not afraid that if I am the skipper
I'll steer my flesh into the bog
[Chorus]
But is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
Is there something in the movies that's better than my love?

[Verse 3]
I carried around a stuffed pig in my arms
And I did it until I was five
I got it from someone who died of attention
And lived an extraordinary life

[Verse 4]
But I gave it to you on the day that we met
'Cause I already trusted you best
And everyone dies but they shouldn't die young
Anyway, you're invited to set

[Chorus]
And is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
Is there something in the movies that's better than my love?

[Outro]
I left you in life 'cause you don't need my pen
To embellish your noteworthy parts
I only write songs about things that I'm scared of
So here, now you're deathless in art
You've got this and the movies and also my love
You can have it all, baby, I'm giving it upYou might also like1Embed
