Can't you see now? (Woo)
NCT in the house
많고많은 저버려진 꿈들 사이 rhyme이 밝혀
Put your glass high
Black on black (Back to back)
Black on black, yeah, rock go hard
Bad boys killers, 우린 extreme villain
거기 넌 우릴 보고 뭔 생각을 해
Speed up, 곧 따라 잡히겠지
우린 잡고 잡아내
Y'all can't do better than this call, bring the noise
NCT, gotta go get 'em
[Verse 2: Mark]
NCT, we the dream chaser, uh
뱉고 뱉지 배 아픈 애들은 또 say somethin'
NCT, we the dream chaser, uh
뱉고 뱉지 배 아픈 애들은 또 say somethin'
Man, our city reap, our lights never sleeping
우리들의 머리 위 씌어놓지마 limit (Who are we?)
NCT의 다 모인 빛을 담을만한 size, what's up?

[Refrain: All]
(Hey!) Black, black, black on
(Hey!) Black, black, black on
Say what, say what
Neo got my back, culture things
Tech, tech, on my mind
Neo got my back, culture things
Tech, tech, on my mind

[Chorus: All]
What? Black on black
Black on, black on, black on
What? Black on black
Black on, black on, black on
What? Black on black
Black on, black on, black on
What? Black on black
Black, black

Go, get your freak on (Woo)
I gave you a sick one (Woo)
Freeze (Freeze) what? 모두 얼려 보자마자
품위는 날 위한 단어야, who's real?
Nobody wears black in here
So who's the different one?
Nobody wears black in here
So who's the special one?
(Nobody wears black in here
So who's the different one?
Nobody wears black in here
So who's the special one?)Embed
