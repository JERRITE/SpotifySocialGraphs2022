Paracetamol Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
I pick you up from outpatients
Your favourite radio station
It doesn't have to be perfect
I just want to feel homesick

[Refrain]
If you put up, put up with me
I'll put up, put up with you
We say things we never mean
Can you put up, put up with me?
[Verse 2]
You were friends with my girlfriend
A couple of keys in the East End
Fighting over minutiae
And heavy petting on the poolside

[Refrain]
If you put up, put up with me
I'll put up, put up with you
We say things we never mean
Can you put up, put up with me?

[Chorus]
I don't like myself, but maybe you do
If you don't like yourself, I'll never stop doing it for you
I don't like myself, but maybe you do
If you don't like yourself, I can carry your paracetamol blues

[Verse 3]
Try to tell you I miss you
You send a dirty picture
I interrupt and I'm addicted
And when you're tired, you're a dickhead if you

[Refrain]
Put up, put up with me
I'll put up, put up with you
We say things we never mean
Can you put up, put up with me?
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't like myself, but maybe you do
If you don't like yourself, I'll never stop doing it for you
I don't like myself, but maybe you do
If you don't like yourself, I can carry your paracetamol blues

[Bridge]
You kind of love to get mortal
I'm on the lime and soda
You're like a beautiful portal
In Wagamama's in Soho

[Chorus]
I don't like myself, but maybe you do
If you don't like yourself, I'll never stop doing it for you
If you don't like yourself, I can carry your paracetamol blues

[Outro]
Put up, put up with me
You know I want to put up, put up with you now
If you put up, put up with me
And I really want to put up, put up with you now
I'm very serious, I'd like to do it (Put up, put up with me)
I really, really want to (Put up, put up with you now)
A couple of keys in the East End (Put up, put up with me)
Put up, put up with me nowEmbed
