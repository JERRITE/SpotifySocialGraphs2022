Someone Else To Be LyricsLooking for another chance
Looking for someone else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun

Relief comes with an interest
For writing in the sand
Belief comes with expression
They come hand in hand
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun

Where everything seems so pretty
When you're sick and tired of the city
Remember, it’s a flower made out of clay
The city
Where everything seems hunky dory
And if you're sitting alone in self pity
Remember, you're just one more person
Who’s living there

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands of a rock'n'roll band
And throw it all away

Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun

Looking for another chance
Someone else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into ...You might also like1Embed
