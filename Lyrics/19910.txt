GBC Forever Lyrics[Intro]
Problems got my hoes going insane
But you're still here, baby, you're still here
But you're still here, baby, you're still here
Mackned, ooh, ooh

[Verse]
I'm going through a phase, but Wicca ain't here
"Don't fall asleep," I repeat last year
Mackned moved a lot, voices in my ear
She let me hit like a car will hit a deer
Problems got my hoes going insane
But you're still here, baby, you're still here
But you're still here, baby, you're still here
Looking for Horse Head in LA
Used to drink lean, now I gotta play it safe
Hate myself, but I don't know how to say it
Actions speak louder, its' a goddamn shame
Cold Hart hopping off and tryna play SKATE
Yawns is mixing my album, and getting paid
But you're still here, baby, you're still here
You're still here, baby, you're still here
Blanco having my back, he keeping me straight
Fish Narc made me sober up and that's great
Me and Tracy closer than anyone I can name
But DÃ¸ves and DreamThug, they're still here
[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking 'bout my niggas not here
But we're still here, we're still here (Ooh, ooh)
Can't stop thinking 'bout my niggas not here
But we're still here, we're still hereYou might also like3Embed
