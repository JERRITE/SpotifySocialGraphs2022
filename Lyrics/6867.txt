Suicide Letter 2 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bitch I’m almost 21, I thought I would be famous by now (Famous by now)
But I’m poppin' pills and crying in my basement right now (But fuck it)
I hate myself, I hate my life, I wanna end my life and if I die today I hope my momma know it’s out of spite (It's out of spite)
Kept my niggas close, I used to keep this bitches closer but these bitches broke my heart, my heart is cold just like my shoulder
All I wanted was your love, you left me standing in the rain
It’s been a year, you’re still the same
You live your life without no shame
Bitch I fucking hate you, and I hope you know that
I'm in a drop-top bumpin' grumpy ville, yeah that's that throwback
And it’s still free my bro PA until I get my bro back
And if I ever leave this earth I pray I’ll never come back
‘Cause all these bitches fucking shady, everybody having babies
Had to cut the lean and pills cause all it did was made me lazy
Put my sidechick in the back because my glocky riding shawty
Pray my ex all by herself 'cause when I see her that’s a body
[Verse 2]
I did sixty in the freeway just to get to your house
And you ain’t even had no bed, we had to sleep on your couch
Can’t believe you’d ever told me we’d be better as friends cause I’d go to hell and back for you and do it again (Do it again)
Spent three hundred on some shoes so I could feel like somebody but I’m still riding by myself cause I don’t fuck with nobody
And now I’m thinking and drinking, you let me fall off the deep end and now I get so fucking sad that me and Victor ain’t speaking
Tables turn and bridges burn, you live your life and you learn
I slit my wrist and pray to God that one day you’ll return
I know you’re sick of me crying, I know you’re sick of me trying
You know I’m smiling on the outside but my insides is dying
Love is where in life is changing, nothing lasts, people change
You hate yourself I hate you too, so deep inside we’re the same
But if I die, I pray to God, you’ll remember my name
I’m of the drugs, I’m speeding fast, I’m tryna stay in my lane
I can’t believe I ever try to write a suicide letter, it’s been a year, I’m still the same and I ain’t doin' much better
But I can’t help how I’m feeling, I’m tryna deal with my feelings so all I do is get depressed and sit and stare at the ceiling
That’s on my soul


[Outro]
Oh my God, my life is over, what the fuck ima do
She used to tell me that she love me and I thought it was true
You know I want to kill myself, I know you got someone new
But I can't even hurt myself cause I'd worry about you
That's on my mommaYou might also like6Embed
