â€‹flip phone Lyrics[Intro]
Rolled out
Rolled up
Yeah

[Verse]
Rolled up in that big truck
With them guns up, with them fuck boys
Smoked out in that Rolls-Royce
Blowin' dope with that bad broad
Shawty know that I got cash, I'ma throw it all if she want that
Every time you see me out, I blow trees out and my blunt fat
'Cause I'm rich, dumpin the clip on a bitch
Inhale the smoke and I exhale the swish
Step to the mic, got the venomous spit
She steady workin' the twerk on the dick
I'm with the shit and I get it
Got loud pack in my swisher
All my life man I kill it, yeah I kill it
All my life I been a hustler, I'm a hustler
How it feel to the be the best
And ain't nobody else can fuck with ya, I don't fuck with ya
Boy, you need to get your numbers up, get your numbers up
How it feel to catch a body wit' the shotty
Twistin' up the Marijuana all day
Feet up, countin' this money all day
Bitch, you can't see us 'cause the money in the way
Smokin' OG blunts to the motherfucking face
Bitch, I'm sippin' Ace of Spades, bitch, it's Oli gettin' paid
Throwin' money in the air, trappin' on a segway
Trappin' on a flip phone
Got the dope for the low
In and out the trap house
Bitch I'm getting bankroll
Know that you ain't see me
[Chorus]
I'm trappin' on a flip phone, yeah
I'm trappin' on a flip phone
Hit my line, got the dope for the low, yeah
I'm trappin' on a flip phone, bitch
I'm trappin' on a flip phone, yeah
I'm trappin' on a flip phone
Hit my line, got the dope for the low, yeah
I'm trappin' on a flip phone, bitch

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm on the flip phone, yeah
I'm trappin' on a flip phone
Hit my line, got the dope for the low
I'm trappin' on a flip phone, bitchYou might also like2Embed
