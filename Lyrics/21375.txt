Lady in Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around meÂ 
From a fight I could not win

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
[Verse 2]
She asked me name my foes then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or god
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
But she would not think of battle
That reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet
Impossible to end
For she the mother of all men
Had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 4]
"Oh lady lend your hand," I cried
"Oh let me rest here at your side"
"Have faith and trust in me," she said
And filled my heart with life
"There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me be assured
I won't be far away"

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 5]
Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her
Black cloak disappear
My labour is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I'll find new heart each time I
Think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize
And say hello for me
