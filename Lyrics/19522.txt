Takinâ€™ My Time LyricsTaking my time
I'm slowing down a little bit
Taking my time
Slowing down a little bit

Yeah when I was a young boy
Honey, my fuse was lit
Yeah when I was a young boy
Honey, my fuse was lit

Losing my way
To something stronger than me
Losing my way
To something stronger than me
Scares me to think about
What's on the road after me
Yeah it scares me to think about
What's on the road after meYou might also likeEmbed
