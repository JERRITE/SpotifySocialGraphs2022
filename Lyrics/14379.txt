Gem of a Bird Lyrics[Verse 1: Kyle Falconer]
Regulars reach for wonders desires
Fed up with rain 'n' forest fires
There's nothing bold enough to say there is nothing at all
These days are going fine
She's not a friend of mine
There's nothing said so sweet
Can anyone hear me?

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer & Katie Gwyther]
I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond
See a friend of mine has a gift of song
Delivered well
Delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear
I have a gem of a bird
Sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful word
The most magnificent words
She puts the pen and the paper in my hand
Tells things she does not think I understand
But I know better than her
[Verse 2: Kyle Falconer]
Envision the position in the lower class den
Think once then think again
Money first then devastation
Won't pull these times are changing
These days are going fine
You're not a friend of mine
There's nothing said so sweet
Can anyone hear me?

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer & Katie Gwyther]
I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond
See a friend of mine has a gift of song
Delivered well
Delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear
I have a gem of a bird
Sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words
The most magnificent words
She puts the pen and the paper in my hands
Says things she does not think I understand
But I know better than her

[Verse 3: Kyle Falconer]
And I tell you there's no one stealing Jupiter from me
And I'll tell you there's no one sings in better harmony
No spaces for fickle minds on Kye Kye to fucking disagree
I have a gem of a birds
Sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words
The most magnificent words
She puts the pen and the paper in my hands
Says things she does not think I understand
But I know better than her

I have a gem of a bird
Sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words
The most magnificent words
I have a gem of a bird
I have a gem of a bird
But I know better than herEmbed
