Poison Or Patience Lyrics[Intro]
Poison or patience to make me okay
'Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Waking up's a rip off
I could be asleep but instead I'm here pissed off
Think about a time that I said something dumb
Should'a caught a fat lip and then some, yeah
And maybe that would make me feel better
Throwin' up my error and I put it under pressure
Take it back, no chance, no way, never
No hope, too late
[Chorus]
Poison or patience to make me okay
'Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself today
I hate myself today (Today)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be upset anymore
Body far from my head, spiral on my bedroom floor
I'm circlin' the drain, better slow it down
Fuck it, never mind, watch me go around
And momma I'm an internet hero
Don't pay a therapist, I got my ones and my zeros
To keep my company when I'm feelin' low
Oh god, I can't afford to be original

[Chorus]
So it's poison or patience to make me okay
'Cause I hate myself today
Every second feels the same
When I hate myself today
I hate myself today
I hate myself today
I hate myself today
Oh god, I hate myself today
You might also like[Outro]
I paid the price for change
(I hate myself today)
I learned to bear the weight
(I hate myself today)
Now I'm sellin' out for pain
(I hate myself today)
And I hate myself todayEmbed
