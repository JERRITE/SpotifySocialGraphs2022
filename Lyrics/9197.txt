Sick and tired of your same mistakes
You never give me what I want, yeah
Boy, get yourself together
You say you want me, but it's too late
I'ma keep it moving, babe
I ain't waiting 'round forever

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
Now you're ringin' up my phone
Sorry love, I ain't at home
'Cause it's Saturday night and I'm on a vibe, baby
[Chorus: Perrie, Leigh-Anne]
If you want my love
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Boy, you better know
You've got to work
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Baby, before I give it up
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Whatever you're doing, it ain't enough
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Baby, if you want my love

[Verse 2: Jesy, All, Jesy & Leigh-Anne]
Come on, boy, let's face it
Everything you're doing right now is so basic
Baby, get the picturе, need to move quicker
Don't you know that if you want my love
You gotta givе me more than pleasure?
Make me feel like I'm the type of sh— that you treasure
I know you got potential to show me that you're special
Gimme that, gimme that

[Pre-Chorus: Jade]
Now you're ringin' up my phone
Tryna get me all alone
But it's Saturday night and I'm on a vibe, baby
