Ragamuffin Man LyricsBorn and raised as a rich man's son
You were always a restless one
Living high only made you low
So you packed up and hit the road

Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holding your head up high
Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
Just look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied?
Stowed a ride on a westbound train
Called yourself by another name
Spent your nights in a mission home
Cast away the life that you'd known

Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holding your head up high
Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
Just look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied?

As you rise in the mornin' rain
Take a look down that road again
Does the thought ever grab your mind
For the life that you've left behind?

Mister Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holding your head up high, high
Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
Just look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied?

(Oh, no, no, no)
Hey, Mister Ragamuffin Man
