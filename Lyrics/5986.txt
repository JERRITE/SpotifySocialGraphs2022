TranslationsPortuguêsFor All You Give Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want to take you everywhere I go
Have you by my side
Take a walk round in every town
Drive across state lines
Like the sun sends a golden stream
In to our front room
I could be the same old light
For you

[Chorus]
Like the morning is always new
I'll give it back to you
Like the rain it just passes through
For all you give
I’ll give it back to you
[Verse 2]
I think about it like a man in need
Every time I'm gone
Wait to see you like a mile long train is
Passing by your door
And my life is set around you now
Tangled up the same
And I will be
The one who calls your name

[Chorus]
Like the night comes black and blue
I'll give it back to you
Like a road runs straight and true
For all you give
I’ll give it back to youYou might also likeEmbed
