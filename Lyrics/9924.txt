Take Over Your Trap Lyrics[Intro: Bankroll Fresh]
(Street)
I buy what I want to buy, nigga
We supply who buy (Bankroll)

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trappin', yams, trappin'
Bags, trappin', packs, trappin'
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
Walked in your trap, spent a fifty
All of my whips got a fifty
My carbine, they chew on a fifty
Fifties on fifties on fifties
L250, it kickin' (Skrrt)
Pull up to the blades, I'm inchin'
You want a bale, then give me the scale
I thumb through the money the quickest
Meet me at the Flying Biscuits
Park straight, not crooked
I heard these fuck niggas snitchin'
I know these pussy niggas bitchin'
Walk in your trap, fuck you and your strap
If if want your shit, I'ma get it
Pussy nigga talkin' beef
Pussy nigga, you know I got it with me

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Grams, trappin', yams, trappin'
Bags, trappin', packs, trappin'
Walk in your trap and take over your trap
Walk in your trap and take over your trap

He get this shit from the soda (Let's get it)
I put that shit in my motor (Okay)
Walk in your trap with a killer

He want the pack out the back
He want the racks out the mat, look
He want the crack out your lap
He put the strap to your back (Okay)
Dope game teachin' fifty ways to get paid
I got J's serving J's, that's that yay serving yay, get it
Get it, get it, get it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Walk in your trap and take over (Yeah)
Maison Margiela on sofas (Woo)
I graduated from the dope game
Residue on my diploma (Tell 'em)
I got that pack on me, don't I? (Don't I?)
I got them racks on me, don't I? (Don't I?)
I got them tabs on me, don't I? (Don't I?)
Barely got room for her number (Damn)
Barely got room for another whip
All of your niggas is counterfeit
All of my niggas are with the shit
All of my niggas is killers (Killers)
All of your niggas is witnesses, I'm making plays (I'm making plays)
I said I'm making plays, I'm serving J's
Rockin' my J's (Rockin' J's), you a beginner (You a beginner)
You a pretender (You a pretender)
You wasn't with us when we in the trenches (Nah)
When we in the slums (Slums), when we in the ghetto (Ghetto, ghetto)
If I trade in the Maybach, I could get twenty Camaros (Goddamn)
I'm counting dinero (Woo), all-black apparel (Yeah)
I fuck on the bitch (Bitch), make her keep on her stilettos, yeah (I did)
Walk in the trap and take over that shit (Woo, uh)
Walk in the trap and take over that bitch
Grams, bags
