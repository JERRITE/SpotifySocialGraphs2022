Cracks Between Lyrics[Verse 1]
Loose change, that I don't have
And all the little things, that make you mad
Yes, it's mountains out of molehills again
Yes, it's mountains out of molehills 'til the end
Missed calls, that I collect
And when you see me, you wring my neck
Yes, it's mountains out of molehills again

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be so good for me
You could be just what I need
Like the salt that clings to your skin
When you spend your days at the beach
[Chorus]
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us

[Verse 2]
Loose ends, won't tie themselves
Are you leaving? It's hard to tell
When it's mountains out of molehills again
Yes, it's mountains out of molehills til' the end

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be so good for me
You could be just what I need
Like the salt that clings to your skin
When you spend your days at the beach

[Chorus]
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us
You might also like[Bridge]
I could be good for you
I don't think you agree
Your mother told you not to swim
If your feet can't touch the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us
Oh yeah
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us
Ooh oh
There's c-c-cracks between us

[Outro]
