How You Feel? (Freestyle) Lyrics[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Yuh
Yuh, lil' bitch, ha
I'ma go back to rappin' about uhm, rappin' about tickles and pickles
Y'all rocking with DJ Scheme, lil' bitch
Yuh (Ayy)
Oh my God, Ronny

[Verse 1: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Yuh
First made her giggle, no tickle, uh
Then made her tickle my pickle, uh
Metal on me like a nickel, uh
Ice on me just like a 'cicle, uh
Might buy a bike
And if I bought a bike, then I'm putting ice on a bicycle, uh
These niggas bite, oh, yes, these niggas bite
Like Mike Tyson, I react with giggles, uh
Danny, how you feel?
[Verse 2: Danny Towers]
I feel great, uh
Hit 'em with a sawed-off, make a bitch nod off
Nigga, this not your day, uh
Niggas get bought out, choppa go gra-tow
Took a bitch out like a date, uh
He ain't ever caught no case
Try to cross me, get put on skates

[Verse 3: Ski Mask the Slump God]
On my plate, A1 steaks
Scope on AR, a-okay
Jetson my car, UFO
Said I'm gettin' cheese kinda like a Dorito
Long live Jahseh, all I know
Oh, also I be flyer than your neighborhood crow

[Verse 4: Danny Towers]
Shh, shh, shh
Brrr, gra-tow
Yeah, I run off with your shit, nigga, what now?
I'm on the block from sun up to sundown
When you was under you were nowhere to be found
I'm servin' them pelicans, I'm in the trap, I do it so elegant
K on my back, revenge on my letterman
Hit with some shots, I ain't feel 'cause adrenaline
Lil' Boat, how you feel?

Just like a million dollars, Danny (Yeah!)
I'm in the Phantom, my bitch got no panties
She can't feel her face, she did two or three Xannies (Xannies!)
Her bestie off X, she popped 'em just like candies
My gang like the Huskies, my G-Wagen dusty
My first Cuban link platinum, it don't get rusty
Brought one with the gang, since he solid, huh, must be (Huh?)
I ran into Berner, he threw me the musty
I took a big whiff, had my face lookin' ugly
These lil' bitches thought that I'm related to Dougie
Her BD a loser, he drivin' a buggy
I'm tired, he lucky, he mad she gon' fuck me
I'm sorry, these bitches are always tryna fuck me
I'm cool, test me, dawg, you a fool
Young prodigy, bitches see me, they drool (Yeah)
Nigga fuck wit' the money, we whoop out the tool
Whippin' my dick on the stool
If she startin', she out it
Got five different rings, cost more than an Audi
My niggas need alibis, they always rowdy
"Boat, why you keep all them Blood niggas 'round you?" (Brrt)
'Cause I can't trust a soul, these niggas might down me (Slatt)
Even though niggas be softer than Downy
Never know when your name got a bounty
[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Scheme, Ski, Danny
