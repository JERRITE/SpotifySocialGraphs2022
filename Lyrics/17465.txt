Burn Break Crash (Madison Mars Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just for a moment
I went along, lost my focus
You already know this
'Cause in a blink of an eye I was flyin'
Yeah, did I mention
I was not payin' attention
When you looked my direction
And in a blink of an eye I was fallin'

[Refrain]
Mama said to look both ways
Watch out where you're goin'
But I still made the same mistake
Without even knowin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Now all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
All I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

Into you, in-into you
Into you, in-into you
Into you, in-into you
Into you, in
Burn, break, crash

Burn, break, crash, explode

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do (Yeah, all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you
You might also like[Bridge]
Now I got you by my side
Now I got you in my life
I'll never be the same
Never be the same
I can't stay and I can't go
Oh, it's out of my control
We're goin' up in flames
Goin' up in flames

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Yeah, I wanna burn, break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me, I know
Now all I wanna do (All I, all I wanna do)
Is keep on crashin' into you
Yeah, all I wanna do
Is keep on crashin' into you, into you

Into you, in-into you
Into you, in-into you
Into you, in-into you
Into you, in
Burn, break, crashEmbed
