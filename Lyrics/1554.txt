Canâ€™t Pretend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love, I have wounds
Only you can mend, you can mend oh, oh
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Feel, my skin is rough
But it can be cleansed, it can be cleansed oh, oh
And my arms are tough
But they can be bent, they can be bent oh, oh
And I wanna fight
But I can't contend
[Chorus]
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend

[Bridge]
Oh, feel our bodies grow
And our souls they blend
Yeah, love, I hope you know
How much my heart depends

[Chorus]
But I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend oh, oh
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, feel our bodies grow
And our souls they blend
Yeah, love, I hope you know
How much my heart depends

[Outro]
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend oh, oh
I guess that's love
I can't pretend, I can't pretend oh, ohYou might also like31Embed
