â€‹why u gotta be like that Lyrics[Intro: vaultboy]
Why you gotta be like that?

[Verse 1: vaultboy]
So back and forth
I don't know if you're bored
You want nothing then more aah-ah
Say something should change
But you just stay the same
I can't see in your brain aah-aah
[Pre-Chorus: vaultboy]
Every time we kiss i ask you
Why we do this every time?
You say that you're just having fun

[Chorus: vaultboy]
Well, why you gotta be like that?
Late night calling my phone
Telling me you wanna get close aah-aah
There you go giving me hope
I don't know, why you gotta be like that?
Always coming on too strong
Never wanna stay too long aah-aah
Then you say that if i fall, then its all my fault
Yeah why you gotta be like that?
(Why you gotta be like that?)
Why you gotta be like that? (why-aah)

[Verse 2: Jonathan Capeci]
Can't call it friends
Yeah 'cause it always ends
With you bending all your rules aah-aah
I know that its kinda sadistic and i'm masochistic
You push me away, then you say that you miss it
I shoulda learned by now that i can't figure you out 'cause
