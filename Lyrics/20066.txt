I PUT MY DICK IN YOUR MENTAL Lyrics[Intro]
LUNARVISION (LUNARVISION)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Gizmo]
Wasted to the core
Ask me shit I don't know anymore
Spit facts 'cause my brain is just a whore
Try to fuck everything that I deplore
Despise now look me in the eyes
You can feel that I just want to demise
Everybody in this underworld enterprise
All based off of lies
I put my dick in your mental, I fuck your face
I feel like your dental
Fuck your chains and your clothes, it's so mental
Fuck your opinion, you're so judgemental
Catastrophic, come and give me top, bitch
Give me long neck just like the Loch Ness
What the fuck makes you think that you're hot shit
You ain't blowin' up because you're fucking soft, bitch
I'm a hard ass, harder than a hard hat
If you're steppin' up to me, you get pushed back
Oh you're bleedin' on the ground, would you look at that
Who the fuck else is trying to get their head cracked
I'm a hard ass, harder than a hard hat
If you're steppin' up to me, you get pushed back
Oh you're bleedin' on the ground, would you look at that
Who the fuck else is trying to get their head cracked
This a smackdown, I don't like to play around
Cops confused at where your body was found
When I smoke loud, know I'm gonna face a pound
When I leave the murder scene I don't make a sound
Got some wannabes, I'm who they wanna be
Everybody always talking like they're under me
All you pussy rappers are my fuckin' sons
They hear me scream and then they start to run
[Verse 2: BLVC SVND]
I'mma go down, pissed off warlord
Hit you in the head with a bat like I just scored
You niggas fake, you is livin' in dopeville
Fuck your bitch so hard I have her clawin' on the cold sore
Niggas try'na test me like I'm a little bitch (I'm not)
Reason them face niggas, we silent as shit
I'm a big edgy beast, I'mma sever niggas' dicks
Straight in the concrete, don't you ever play with me

[Outro]
