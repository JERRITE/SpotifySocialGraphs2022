Wrangler Lyrics[vtizzel]

Futile, wet a nigga up
Oops wow, my mistake
Let me hit him with a few towels
Too fowl, left him hanging
For my entertainment
That is flagrant like 2 fouls
Shoot now, pow pow pow, nigga
Bam bam bam like Emeril Lagasse
Devil's chair, my seat
Put him in the hot seat
Nigga hit the board hard like a pop beat
Sake, that's what I drink when a ninja wanna try me
Wipe his sinus, high knees
He was tryna get it out  me my niggas
So we put another crack in his hiney
Try me, I'm sharp like pine needle
Money in life is a cheat code
Yes no I'm broke so I need dough
That's why we throwing all these shows
(Bitch ,Uh ,Uh)
Put a whole stain on ya clothes with a stainless
He ain't think fast so he froze now he brainless
Hakuna Matata in heaven he singing (on god)
Yes, he just got put to the test
Why'd he pull up with a vest
Musta not seen me on Fortnite and cod
Cuz all that I do is just aim for the head
I'm cooler than you and I'm krillen it
I goku coo, bitch
Just Saiyan, put him in a freezer
In his Adidas, loaded up the chop in the shop, just spraying
Yah oh nah
Put him in the street
So I put him in a car
Gave a nigga a good beat
He was acting like he raw
He was talking out his teeth
So I hit him in the jaw (Ah)
[Mellay]

Realigned, with the unpopular kids, the unconventional, non-logical, Dark apartment shit
We start dropping hits, inside of the whip
Where the glove apartment is
Apocalypse, to all ya’ll
Fall in order, all disorder, broke through all the borders, all the walls And corridors are torn up
Hear the court of law call order, order
Counter culture caught inside the rat race
Do your part complain about the bad pay
Get promoted, pop the cap of champagne
Make your parents proud you play the damn game
Hold the caller, busy call you back
Boss give order, you cannot relax
You just trying to kick it with your friends
But hold on up your girl is on your neck
All of this monotony, will follow me, until I fight back
I was giving up, settling for the low pay they was given us
Paid off credit cards they start building up
And my college degree never did none
Paid all my dues, and I still can’t get none
I’ve been depressed, so a pill what I pill pop
Friend buy big bag, blow chop, skill saw
(Chhh yeah snort it)
Particles all up inside of his nostril
I went with family way up to lake Taho
Everyone white I stand out like I’m Pablo
I grew up good, I should be happy by now
V, he straight outa the woods
Misunderstood, what they be calling me now
Cause they cannot tell me what’s good
(Fuck nah)You might also likeEmbed
