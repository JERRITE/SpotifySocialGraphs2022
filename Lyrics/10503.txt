Finish Him Lyrics[Intro]
I'm runnin' for president
Fuck ya lil' bitch, give her evidence
Sip on my medicine

Fuck ya lil' bitch, give her evidence
Sip on my medicine

[Verse]
I'm runnin' for president
Fuck ya lil' bitch give her evidence
Sip on my medicine
Yeah I got diamonds, my ring
Yeah I got diamonds, my chain
You run off go bang
And I just cool with my gang
And we just hit with them thangs
And we known for twisting fingers
You run up on me you get fucked up
Lil' bro just sold his soul
Lil' bro just sold his soul for a lil' pot a gold
It ain't the way to go

I used to be broke
Now I be selling them shows
I'm fucking your ho
Diamonds On my neck it be froze
Got diamonds my pinky, my thumb
You look at me boy I go dumb
.30 on me with no drum, bitch huh
.30 on me with no drum
'Cause lil' bro like to kill

Fireman doing drills
I fuck a bitch from Brazil
Wait she was so thick
Man this lil' bitch was so thick, ho
Hoes a lil' bitch, they gon' snitch
Hoes a lil' bitch, they gon' snitch
'Cause it's goin' down, basement
I fucked her cousin, replacement
You talkin' boy, you ain't on shit
You talkin' lame, you ain't own shit
I send my shooters at you, ooh
