Another Victim 2 the Wolves LyricsAnother shook one, made em look
I'm a renegade, ain't a crook
Another victim to wolves

Ima get some, paid in full
Get ya mind right, duck the lime light
Check ya blind side, got em in my iron sight
I define bright, undermine strife
You a lost soul caught up in the grime life

Hate abortion, fame or fortune
Pick a side if you wanna go to war kid
Made a orphan, raid the fortress
Laid the corpses underneath the flooring

Look around everything tainted
Minds blanking, everybody vacant
I could touch a cloud from the pavement
I been on the prowl, never lane switched

Nothing been the same
Something like a golden eye, I been on my game
Knock em out the frame
I don't gotta aim it
I don't gotta do none, I know that you hate itYou might also likeEmbed
