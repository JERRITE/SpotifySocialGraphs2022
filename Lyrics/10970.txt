Evergreen Lyrics[Verse 1]
I kissed my penny and I threw it in
I prayed I'd keep my soul
Went down to the river where the water bends
The only place I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees
[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

[Verse 2]
Standing at the water's edge
The Mississippi's overflowing
Hold your current in my hands
You bring the meaning to my moments

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees

[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

[Bridge]
Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees
Oh, I feel so
Hopeless against the stream
You might also like[Chorus]
So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard in Heaven
So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard
My evergreen
Evergreen
