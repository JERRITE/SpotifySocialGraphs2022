Young Juiceman and my life is like the J. Kidd (Ayy)
With stupid fruity crazy swag, jumping in your lady (Ayy)
Banana donk Chevy interior like the Lakers (Ayy)
LeBron James wrist when I'm fucking with that caper (Okay)
Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper rake up (Damn)
Booming out the house in J's asking for a wakeup (Damn)
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Mauri shoe-walking and and the head a N.O. gator
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs (Okay, okay, okay)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
The twerkin' bird's in, so we working (Workin')
Pack in a truck stop, a trailer back-end (Work)
We big flip jugg, we towed it off the forklift (Work)
The way my plug kick it, you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so big, Big Boy can weigh his damn self (Ha)
Two thousand pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self (Ha)
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills (Let's go)
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is (Huh)
My number lower than a ese from Texas (Shit)
A quarter mill' in the mail is an investment (Huh)
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
A Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a Desert (Bow)
I sacked a ounce up before I sold a record
He want a brick, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's" (Ha)
I sacked a pound up before I sold a record (Ha)
He want a bale, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's" (Ahh)
