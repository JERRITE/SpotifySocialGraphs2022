Creatures of the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know a place where
We can head up there
Still on the sunset, to the sky
Wave to the people
Everyone you know, up on a satellite

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly
[Chorus]
Head for the stars, be who we are
Living like creatures of the night
Never grow old, stay young in our soul
We can outrun the daylight
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are

[Post-Chorus]
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night

[Verse 2]
Over the rainbow, chasing the shadows
You know the story's just begun
Rocking the blue jeans, jammin' to Springsteen
Baby, we're born to run

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly
You might also like[Chorus]
Head for the stars, be who we are
Living like creatures of the night
Never grow old, stay young in our soul
We can outrun the daylight
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are

[Post-Chorus]
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night (Whoa, yeah)
Living like creatures of the night

[Refrain]
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night

[Outro]
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night6Embed
