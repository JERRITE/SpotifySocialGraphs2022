High Beams (JPEGMAFIA Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: Tkay Maidza & JPEGMAFIA]
Ooh-wee, yes Lord
High beams, we goin'
Yes, we stay low
I feel way gone
Ooh-wee, yes Lord
I've been slept on (Slept on)
They late (They late), (Yes Lord) can't go (Can't go)
High beams, we goin'

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Amen, yes Lord
Hands to the sky for a fresh start
When the pressure get applied, better find God
When the pressure get applied, better, uh
Man, we coulda stuck a Glock in a smack car
These niggas bitches when they grow up, they just act hard
But it's the alt-rap Beavis with no bars
And we gon call a spade a spade, we pullin' ya card
This ain't no problem, not no worry, not no threat at all
Keeping the fallacies for people who ainâ€™t for real at all
That's why the fake get praised and the real fall
Sixth man, no press and I still ball
These niggas be taller, broke
Worried 'bout niggas that's smaller and won't get you farther
Fuck a MO, money and problems
Sellin' my soul, I guess I just solved them
[Chorus: Tkay Maidza & JPEGMAFIA]
Ooh-wee, yes Lord (Dirty)
High beams, we goin'
Yes, we stay low
I feel way gone
Ooh-wee, yes Lord
I've been slept on (Slept on)
They late (They late), can't go (Can't go)
High beams, we goin'

[Post-Chorus]
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')

[Verse 2: Tkay Maidza]
I've been feelin' like I'm, yeah, I'm runnin', yeah, I'm runnin' free
With the wind, I'm the kid smilin' to the sun
Oh Lord, love me all these memories
What a bliss, inner peace
Inner state of mind, innocence
To give me that and let it be, jelly beans (High beams)
I get all my meds from a telly screen
I get all the chips on the deck
And the foot on the neck, that's collateral damage when I snap
Flesh, yeah
Eatin' the flesh, yeah
Why you so precious?
Why you look pressured?
Hidin', fightin', smoke
Hidin', oh, fightin', oh
Oh my God, oh my God, fight and shoot
Fighting you
This ain't no games, yeah, it's on when I shoot
Labels are gettin' the feeling and

High beams, we goin'
Yes, we stay low
I feel way gone
Ooh-wee, yes Lord
I've been slept on (Slept on)
They late (They late), can't go (Can't go)
High beams, we goin'

[Post-Chorus: Tkay Maidza]
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')
High beams (We goin')1Embed
