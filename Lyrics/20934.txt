Fresh Wind LyricsNight's as dark as dark can be
And winter's oh, so cold
The light seems like a fantasy
Or a legend we've been told

I was wondering if spring would come
But now I think I see

A fresh wind blowin'
A new love growin'
I'm as happy as a man can be
Sometimes the truth is hard to see
When fear gets in your eye
But there are some things in this world
You'll always recognize
True as steel, straight as an arrow
That pierces to the heart of me
A fresh wind blowin'
A new love growin'
I'm as happy as a man can be

If the earth is turning
And the sun is burning
Then it's all right with me
A fresh wind blowin'
A new love growin'
I'm as happy as a man can be

A fresh wind blowin'
A new love growin'
I'm as happy as a man can be

A fresh wind blowin'
A new love growin'You might also likeEmbed
