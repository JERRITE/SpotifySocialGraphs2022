I Like Dat Lyrics[Intro: T-Pain]
Boop, boop
Ooh, ooh
(Ooh, DJ Montay)
(Oomp Camp Productions, fire)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She always ride with the top down
Even when it's cold outside (Cold outside)
Ooh, she got the keys to the boutiques
She don't do 9 to 5
Hundred thousand viewers on her IG live (Oh)
Huh (Huh), she do it (Do it)
Make a toast to it
You ain't never heard of that and that Birkin bag stupid
You ain't never heard her brag or say that she goin' through it
I just wanna tap it, tap it, boop, boop it one time
Ooh (Ooh), just give me one night, I can make her mine
'Cause I know she done came a long way
[Refrain: T-Pain]
She don't want drinks no morе if you ain't bringin' no dough to the table
Ooh, ooh, you know that your bank account big, come back on a weekеnd, you ain't able
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, she gon' be like, "I got it," pull a thousand dollars out her side pocket
Ooh that lil' bit of drank you tried to buy, stop it
Bottles on me, the cork look like a skyrocket, pop it

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, she don't want the drink, she want the rent paid
Ooh, ooh-ooh, she don't pay for nothin', she just get paid
Ah, ah, ah-ha, I like that
She don't even need me to try
Ooh, ooh-ooh, she pull up in the 'Rari with the roof up
Ooh, ooh-ooh, I'm just buying drank, she doin' too much, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Ooh yeah)
I like that, she don't even need me to buy her nothin'

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
Drank
She got money in the bank
What you think 'bout that?
She know she fly, she stuntin' (Ooh)
She gon' buss it (Ooh)
What you think 'bout that?

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Every band I'm throwin' on stage, I got in my name, all that
And I ain't throwin' twenties or tens, I'm out here paying rent and all that
And I-I-I could get the Dom but I'ma get the Ace (A-Ace)
Just to run it up and see everybody face (Fa-face)
When they bring the check so I can sign my name
I might have to face all that
Now tell the valet bring my foreign to the front, yeah, yeah
I'm gettin' in solo, I got it solo
Let the cameras hit my diamonds cuts, yeah, yeah
I got them rocks solo, I got it solo
It's real bossed up, fly shit
I ain't the passenger, I'm the pilot
You could hop in but you ain't drivin'
And all I need is somebody to ride with
'Cause I'm a go getta, oh-oh (I'ma go, say I'ma go)
Type of girl that got you 'cause I want you, not 'cause I need you
No, I don't need you
