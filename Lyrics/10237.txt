Somebody I’m Not Lyrics[Verse 1]
This girl came up to me
Thought I looked really cool
Singing on TV
Said, "I wanna be like you
'Cause your life is perfect
And you got no worries at all
Just tell me your secret
What do I gotta do?"

[Pre-Chorus]
She go, "How does it feel living the dream?
How does it feel living the dream all the ti-i-ime?"
She said, "I-I-I
I gotta have this, wanna be rich
I gotta have this, wanna be rich in this li-i-ife"
Told her, I-I-I
[Chrous]
I struggle to pay the rent
My dog is my only friend
I spend every day I’ve got
Being somebody I'm not
I made it all the way up
But somehow, it's still not enough
I spend every day I’ve got
Being somebody I'm not

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Being somebody I'm not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I’m no-no-no-not
Being somebody I’m not

[Verse 2]
This girl came up to me
After a show
She wanted to do it
In the back of my Volvo
Said, "Would you like to know me first
Before we take off our clothes?"
She said, "You're rich and famous
That’s all I need to know"

She go, "How does it feel living the dream?
How does it feel living the dream all the ti-i-ime?"
She said, "I-I-I
I gotta have this, wanna be rich
I gotta have this, wanna be rich in this li-i-ife"
Told her, I-I-I

[Chrous]
I struggle to pay the rent
My dog is my only friend
I spend every day I've got
Being somebody I'm not
I made it all the way up
But somehow, it's still not enough
I spend every day I’ve got
Being somebody I'm not

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Being somebody I'm not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Somebody I'm no-no-no-not
Being somebody I'm notEmbed
