Top Shotter Lyrics[Intro: DMX]
Rrrrrgh, uh, uh-huh
Uh.. uhh uhh, uh-huh

[Hook: DMX]
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
[Verse 1: DMX]
Here comes the boom! Boomin, bouncin'
Stalkin', must walk in, hawk get to pouncin'
Get 'em where it counts and, hit em like a mountain
Spit 'em have em spittin' out, blood like a fountain
Don't look at me like that, we just might fight black
And that fight might end up in me takin' your life back
I don't go for the bullshit, cause I've been down
And time is, just too important to be fuckin around
Chump nigga, I stomp a mudhole in your face
Motherfucker, rip your butthole out of place
Cock the Glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yeah it's a dirty job, but I just love doin' it

[Hook: DMX]
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom

[Verse 3: Mr. Vegas, Sean Paul & DMX]
Wha do da claffi dey

Like a scared wretch wi leff dem fi later
Wi keep goin on an on an on fill di body a ole juss like straina
Yo, yo, yo yo man!

Killin is fun an wi nuh need not a salary
Full up a di hamma suh nuhbody cyaan falla we
An wi nuh owe nuh apology, yo, well
I did more kinds of war crimes more times
Than in war times, went way before times
You know what's sad man, that I'm such a mad man
Bad man, with that BOOM you never had man
