Chrome Hearts Lyrics[Intro]

Get dat bag, Getro
James, just play it already
Tom French with them racks

[Chorus]

I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one (yeah)
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’ (yeah)
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal none
I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal, heal none
[Verse 1]

Come on
Ain’t I fly as frick, I got a Chanel carryon
I got my drip from right up out the trenches, Marian’
I had to fight her mans with my two hands like Ambipom
I’ve been a ladies man since seesaw
Your girl in the front seat of my Mustang screaming ‘yeehaw’
I think she tryna pipe but I don’t smoke on treetop
About to run the game with my eyes closed, can’t even sleepwalk
Just dropped a banger, top it, oh oh, oh oh, oh
I’m playing games, I told his girl to come and bop it, yeah
I’m in the PJ wearing PJs in the cockpit
I’m in the drop, where is my roof, I think I lost it (haha)

[Chorus]

I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one (yeah)
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’ (yeah)
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal none
I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal, heal none

Ahey
Lame boy’s a mere mortal, call him Morty like I’m Rick
I stack my green like cactus ‘cause that girl says I’m a prick
She said she wanna ride and now I know that girl drives stick (haha)
Stare at my hand, my Gucci wristwatch
I got a purple Lamborghini, look like Rick Ross
I used to drink out Zephyrhills, flexed up to big Voss
I swerve my coupe, frick lanes, my guy, I’m playing criss cross
I’m boutta run the world, can’t stop me, no
I got unprecedented sauce, not teriyaki, yeah
I look like ocean and that lame looks like Mojave
I made my doors the suicide, go kamikaze

[Chorus]

I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one (yeah)
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’ (yeah)
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal none
I wear Chrome Hearts because, like, I don't have a real one (have a real one)
She said she never felt a heartbreak, boutta feel one
I said, ‘I’ve never had a heart, I’m boutta steal one’
She said I left her with some wounds and she can't heal, heal noneEmbed
