Action Cat Lyrics[Verse 1]
We want television bodies that we can't keep
We have battles in the dark when she falls asleep

[Chorus]
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care, we just pretend
With our faces on the mend
And don't ask a lot and you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much
[Verse 2]
And the accidental damage I wouldn't shake
And the heart I left behind that you couldn't break

[Chorus]
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care, we just pretend
With our faces on the mend
And don't ask a lot and you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much

[Bridge]
And I said I miss you
Say "I miss you too"
Said I miss you
Say "I miss you too"
Said I miss you
Say "I miss you too"

[Verse 3]
We want action and decision that we can't fake
We got firecracker wishes that we can make

[Chorus]
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care, we just pretend
With our faces on the mend
And don't ask a lot and you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much

'Cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you too15Embed
