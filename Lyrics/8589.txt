Let’s Get Crazy Lyrics[Intro]
You ready?
Woo
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Life is just a party, so come as you are
Dress it up or dress it down, don’t forget your guitar (Yeah)
Just be courageous, 'cause style’s contagious
Everyone can rock out like a superstar
[Chorus]
Let’s get crazy
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth takin' a chance, let's get crazy
Yeah, just kick up your heels
Don’t miss out, time to shout
Always keepin' it real, let's get crazy
Crazy

[Post-Chorus]
Our songs, our style, our hair, our smile
Our laughs, our heart, our grace, our smarts

[Verse 2]
You see me on the cover of a magazine (Remember)
Things are always different than the way that they seem (Ha)
Here’s an invitation to every nation
Meet me on the dancefloor and we’ll make the scene

[Chorus]
Let’s get crazy
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth takin' a chance, let's get crazy
Yeah, just kick up your heels
Don’t miss out, time to shout
Always keepin' it real, let's get crazy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)

Now's the time to unwind
Lose yourself in the crowd, let's get crazy

[Outro]
