Sweet Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
I like the bags under your eyes
It makes me wonder what you lose sleep over
And if I could be of any help
Me, it's late in the AM, my thoughts are overflowing
And pouring, just bathe in my mind with me

[Chorus]
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul
[Verse 2]
My heart races when I write a new day
I feel I'm running out of time to leave my lines that last time
But does it even matter anyway, oh
I think it is just my pride getting in the way

[Chorus]
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul
Baby, I need your sweet soul

[Outro]
Cause we're all lovely and we're ugly
Give me your lovely, lovely, lovely
We're all lovely and we're ugly
Give me your lovely, lovely, lovely
We're all lovely and we're ugly
But give me your lovely, lovely, lovely
Baby, I need your sweet soulYou might also likeEmbed
