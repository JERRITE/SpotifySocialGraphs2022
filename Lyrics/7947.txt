Ocean of Tears Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is gonna be torture
Before it's sublime
Does that make it crazy?
Cash in all of my courage
Before you're all mine
Does that make it crazy?

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Show me the future
Yeah, I'm all eyes
Tell me you're ready (I'm ready)
Pulse was rising and racing and racing and racing
But it's a long ride
Tell me you're ready

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh

Show me the fu-fu-fu-, fu-fu-
