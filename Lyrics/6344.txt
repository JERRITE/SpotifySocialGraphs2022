Molecules (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a path of will up ahead?
Or are we just destined to get what we get?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drawn to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all

[Chorus]
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
[Verse 2]
We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a sign of will in our heads?
Or are we predestined to get what we get?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drawn to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all

[Chorus]
I wanna confess that you own me (That you own me)
And we don't rest if we're lonely (If we're lonely)
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive

[Bridge]
We've been dressed as humans
We've been kings and homeless
Still, we're just fragments of a great collide (Great collide, great collide)

[Chorus]
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
I wanna confess that you own me (That you own me)
And we don't rest if we're lonely (If we're lonely)
There's innocence in the moment (In the moment)
Maybe now's the time to be alive
Maybe now's the time to be aliveYou might also likeEmbed
