Taste (Speed) Lyrics[Intro]
I want a taste of you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'd burn this world for you
And if you leave, I'm coming too, oh-oh
You feel so cold, I'm turning blue
Where'd you go? I wish I knew, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Come close
Want you to take my soul
[Chorus]
I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do

[Verse 2]
I hear you whispering my name
You're moving on, but I can't change, oh-oh
It feels intoxicating
When you look at me that way, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Come close
Want you to take my soul

[Chorus]
I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I'm begging you, untie this noose
Want your hands 'round my neck
I'm begging you, come be my muse
You're all that I have left
You might also like[Chorus]
I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do
I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always doEmbed
