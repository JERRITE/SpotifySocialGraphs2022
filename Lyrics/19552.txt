1000 Highways Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never know when the hunger strikes
I could live a hundred lives to find truth
I could lose a hundred times
Miss out every summer just to win with you
Drove through a Vegas night
Hands like a bag of ice, almost puked
That's when I knew that I
Wanna spend the rest of my life with you

[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand highways just to get here
The trail of tears that we've traveled through
And all the lost time that we've made up
Ain't enough time for me and you
[Chorus]
You've become my omen
Only one I've chosen
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you
If you feelin' low, then
You won't be alone, I
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you
I'll be here for you
I'll be here for you

[Verse 2]
A thousand ways we could all end up
Whether broke or ballin', Ima still have you
Driving down the number 9
I'd fall down a hundred times to stand for you
Sippin' wine out of paper cup
Layin' next to you in a hotel room
That's when I knew that I
Wanna spend the rest of my life with you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand highways just to get here
The trail of tears that we've traveled through
And all the lost time that we've made up
Ain't enough time for me and you
You might also like[Chorus]
You've become my omen
Only one I've chosen
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you
If you feelin' low, then
You won't be alone, I
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you

[Bridge]
So when this highway starts to turn right
And these headlights don't shine so bright
And all our stories ain't quite as new
Just know, just know I'll be here for you

[Chorus]
You've become my omen
Only one I've chosen
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you
If you feelin' low, then
You won't be alone, I
Fell in love with knowin'
I'll be here for you
I'll be here for youEmbed
