Banana Clip Lyrics[Intro: Namasenda]
Ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip
Ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip

[Verse 1: Namasenda]
Hop out the whip
At the club, took a trip (Okay, okay)
Pour up and sip
Gotta load up my clip
Shots to my lips
Shoot my shot from the hip
I'm the top of this list
Give me top, then I'll dip (Ooh)
Rocks on my wrist
Looking frosty and shit
I'm gon' pop in this bitch
Now they hop on my dick
Hop on this shit
It's a bop, it's a hit
I don't flop, I don't miss
I'm on top of the Ritz (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Namasenda]
Head is spinnin' 'round like a revolver ('Volver)
Need another round, then I'll reload it (Load it)
I'm gonna regret this when I'm sober
But I won't stop, I do shots after shots

[Chorus: Namasenda]
Like a ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip
Ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip
Shots after shots after shots, I won't quit
Like a ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip

[Verse 2: Namasenda]
Me, I'm no angel
Stole me a halo
Scoped out a playboy
Oh, he's an a-hole
Shots like a Draco
Color of rainbows
Place look like paintball
I'm sprayin' a space bottle
Hop out the Range Rover
Comе through the place for
Someonе to take home
And knock out a K.O
Snapshots, they take those
We crop out the fake hoes
They shut down the place
That's at least what we aim for

Head is spinnin' 'round like a revolver ('Volver)
Need another round, then I'll reload it (Load it)
I'm gonna regret this when I'm sober
But I won't stop, I do shots after shots

[Chorus: Namasenda]
Like a ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip
Ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip
Shots after shots after shots, I won't quit
Like a ba-nanana-nanana-nana clip

[Bridge: Mowalola]
Ooh, yeah
Oh my God
Ooh, yeah
Oh my God
Hello, hello, 'kay
Hello, hello, 'kay
Hello, hello, 'kay
I'll cut you off
Yeah, I'll cut you again (Cut you again)
Shot after shots, spin the bottle again
Hello, hello, 'kay
Hello, hello, 'kay
Hello, hello, 'kay (Oh my God)
Oh my God
[Chorus: Namasenda]
