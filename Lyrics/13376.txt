Sex, Drugs, Etc. Lyrics[Verse 1: Nick Santino]
Late night telephone
Calling all the wallflowers I know
Out the dark and into the light
Half love, half regret
Dressing up for Polaroids and cigarettes
Socialize, romanticize the life

[Chorus]
Floating on my low-key vibe
Floating on my low-key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe
Vibe
Vibe, vibe
[Verse 2]
Bulletproof passengers
On the road to sex, drugs, et cetera
Get out the dark and into the light
Everywhere I go I know that I don't wanna be
Part of something I won't ever need
Your socialized, romanticized life

[Chorus]
Floating on my low-key vibe
Floating on my low-key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe
Vibe
Vibe, vibe

[Bridge]
Out of touch in harmony
Designer drugs from dead end streets
Break the air to feel the fall
Or just feel anything at all

[Chorus]
Floating on my low-key vibe
Floating on my low-key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe
Vibe
Vibe, vibe

Floating on my low-key vibe
Floating on my low-key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on myâ€”10Embed
