Magdalena Lyrics[Verse 1]
Overcome by your
Moving temple
Overcome by this
Holiest of altars

[Chorus 1]
So pure, so rare
To witness such an earthly goddess
That I've lost my self control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
[Verse 2]
Down before your
Holiest of altars

[Chorus 2]
I'd sell my soul and my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss
One taste of you, my Magdalena

[Bridge]
I bear witness to this place
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an earthly goddess

That I'd sell my soul
My self-esteem a dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss
One taste of you, my black Madonna

[Chorus 2]
I'd sell my soul and my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one taste, one taste
One taste of you, my MagdalenaYou might also like2Embed
