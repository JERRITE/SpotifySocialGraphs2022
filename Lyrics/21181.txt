Surrender Lyrics[Verse]
We let the waters rise
We drifted to survive
I needed you to stay
But I let you drift away

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, where are you?
My love, where are you?

[Chorus]
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Can we?
Can we surrender?
Can we?
Can we surrender?
I surrender
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
No one will win this time
I just want you back
I'm running to your side
Flying my white flag, my white flag

[Pre-Chorus]
My love where are you?
My love where are you?

[Chorus]
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
Can we?
Can we surrender?
Can we?
Can we surrender?
I surrender
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I surrender
Can we surrender?
I surrenderYou might also like17Embed
