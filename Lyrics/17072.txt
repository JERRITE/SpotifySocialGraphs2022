Wavy (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
(Earl on the beat)

[Chorus: Lil Keed]
(Woo)
You can drip or get drowned, homie
Mini Draco, I just put a fifty round on it
Coolant kit, silencer, damn, ain't no sound on it
Turn your face to a frown, homie (Huh), oh-woah
I just been shinin' in rose gold
We in the street like hobos (Wavy)
I'm having boogers, no coke nose
These niggas sweeter than high and low (Wavy)
Cake havin' hands, he beatin' the bowl
Playin' the cards that was dealt to me (Wavy)
Livin' the life that we choose, yeah, yeah (Wavy)
[Post-Chorus: Lil Keed & Travis Scott]
Yeah, I got up with a slut, she so (Wavy)
Chanel belt hold that fin up, I'm so (Wavy)
King Tut, I'm the real prince slime, I'm so (Wavy)
Hope you niggas can put it on, with these clothes, we get (Wavy, yeah)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Lil Keed]
Nutritionist like how I put them greens on your spine
I kept missin' all your calls 'cause, bitch, you got the other line (Straight up)
We been doublin' 'em since May, back when Maybach can't make this time
My dawg like Oakley, I'm like Jordan, he just do it, I pay the fine (La Flame)
I ain't seen the sun in seven days like I been doin' time (Yeah)
That's just how I got the Batcave built up when I'm on the grind (Yeah)
Elli' VV blingin' on my phone and I ain't losin' sleep (Ooh, yeah)
I told shawty call your hoes but they can't post when they with me (Ooh, ooh, no)
Out on Bleveland sippin' purple rain with Prince and Lil Keed (Ooh, it's lit)
I be feelin' like I'm Michael Jackson when I hit the hee
My chain make 'em make a face reaction like they gotta sneeze (Yeah, yeah)
All of them flashes and splashes makin' you think you in photos, what up? (Yeah, yeah, all that, all that, yeah, yeah, mmm)
I be takin' Cactis to the face, it turned me to a beast
Heard the opps outside, we take they heads and turn it to a piece

[Interlude: Lil Keed]
Yeah, we spin your block in a Gucci mask, okay
Copped the Panamera for the rain, okay

Watch who you trust, man, 'cause these niggas got sticky fingers (Let's go)
Fucked that bitch, I'll never see a ring finger
She suck my dick 'til my toes curl, I feel a real tingle
Money in this pocket, this pocket, can't even walk, I'm a real penguin
Respect, I'ma live by it, die by it, yeah, just for my people (Oh yeah)
I'm fly as fuck, soarin' through 'em, I ain't talking no eagle (Yeah)
Catch a ho and snatch her up, my mood on jeepers creepers
So much flodge shit happenin', I can't even look at people
Ayy, yeah, my bitch know I'm a whole cheater
Yeah, I ran this shit up just like a whole cheetah (Yeah)
Hey, big shoes like I'm old people (Yeah)
I ride with pole-keepers (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, watch what you do or you say, you on pins and needles
Shit, watch how the hood act when you get real millions
And you better keep them racks or you ain't gon' see them people
