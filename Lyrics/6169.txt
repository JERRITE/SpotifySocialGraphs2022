Lost Boys (Ocean Park Standoff vs. Seeb) Lyrics[Intro]
Let's take the night off, and caring about tomorrow
Don't know where we're going
But it's somewhere out there

[Verse 1]
We got our whole lives left
To make some memories
Drunk nights that we forget
I will remember best
We stole a tricycle
And then it all goes bad
Handcuffs behind my back
Yeah, I remember that
[Bridge]
Oh, we're not gonna grow up
Oh, least not till the sun's up

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take the night off from caring about tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're going
But it's somewhere out there

[Chorus]
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
But it's somewhere out there
It's late but no light yet
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't where we going
But it's somewhere out there
It's late but no light yet

It's late but no light yet
Still time for Juliet
To hear my Romeo
Yell through the window

[Bridge]
Oh, we're not gonna grow up
Oh, least till not the sun's up

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's take the night off from caring about tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're going
But it's somewhere out there

[Chorus]
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
But it's somewhere out there
It's late but no light yet
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
The o, the ocean
Don't know where we going
But it's somewhere out there
It's late but no light yet
The o, the ocean (So late it's early now)
We don't know where we going
The o, the ocean (Watchin' the moon go down)
Don't know where we going
The o, the ocean (Holding your breath)
Don't know where we going
But it's somewhere out there (Let it out, let it out)
It's late but no light yet

Let's take the night off from caring about tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're going
But it's somewhere out there

[Outro]
We got our whole lives left
To make some memories, yeah
Those nights that we forget
I will remember bestEmbed
