Dragon Energy Lyrics[Verse 1: Tag Shai]
Yeah
I'll be talking to myself at night
Making love is a past time
And I thought I said it was ass time, oh yeah
Rampage through the streets
And I'm switching lanes in the sheets
Hold up, switching lanes is discrete
Hold up, we can hang out all week
Yeah, bang bang you're dead
Yeah, uh, yeah
Freestyle off my head, yeah
Freestyle off my Zed, yeah
Hold up, yeah, swag, yeah
Swagging on your bitch
You'll be switching like a switch
Hold up, yeah you are a bitch, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Tag Shai]
Hold up, you want to see my friends?
Come on here baby don't you see the end with me?

[Chorus: Tag Shai]
Hold up, you want to see my friends?
Come on here baby don't you see the end with me?
Hold up, yeah baby don't pretend
Come on here baby won't you be back home with me?
Be back, be, be back home
Come on here baby won't you be back, be, be back home with me?
Be back be, be back home
Come on here baby won't you be back, be, be back home with me?

[Verse 2: Nae Sano]
Got me a check and it's fat, fat like your bitch
Baby, I know you want ice, I'll pay for that shit
Yeah I like your fishnetted thighs and you like my wrist
Glossy lips blowing them clouds and she wants a kiss
Aye yeah, baby your fine, yeah phone calls declined yeah
You getting mad cuz your girlfriend just want a good time aye
Shawty I'm dead, aye, she gave me head yeah
Then she went home and she kissed you good night in your bed yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tag Shai]
Hold up, you want to see my friends?
Come on here baby don't you see the end with me?
