A Young Understanding Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hold on tight, you've got a way to go
You're terrified by the open road
In a daze, you've lost control
You've found a gang
And it makes you feel better than the other girls

[Pre-Chorus]
And you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
One's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven
[Chorus]
Let go, there is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding

[Verse 2]
Cruising 'round in a friend's new car
You've always know they won't get you far
Found yourself on a downward slope
It's okay, 'cause it makes you feel better than the other girls

[Pre-Chorus]
And you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
One's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

[Chorus]
Let go, there is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding

Torn apart, can't you see?
They left their hearts in the 70s
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
Reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

[Chorus]
Let go, there is nothing more to hide
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding
You know, that time is on your side
Seeing life through closed eyes
It's just a young understanding

[Outro]
Reach for a sign
It's just a young understanding
Reach for a sign
It's just a young understanding2Embed
