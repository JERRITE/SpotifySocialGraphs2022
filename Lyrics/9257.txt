Three Lock Box Lyrics[Intro]
Suckers walk, money talks
But it can't touch my three lock box
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Mysteries of the days of old
If you find the key, you got the gold

[Chorus]
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box
[Verse 2]
Treasure's here, sunken there
Buried treasure's everywhere, ooh

[Chorus]
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box

[Verse 3]
Don't go far, circle close
The father, son, the holy ghost
To the trinity, I raise a toast
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box
One, two, three lock box

[Verse 4]
Secrets of the trinity
Lie within the number three
Ooh, hey

[Outro]
