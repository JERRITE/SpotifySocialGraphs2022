Iâ€™ll Be Your Baby Tonight (feat. UB40) - 2009 - Remaster LyricsClose your eyes - close the door
You don't have to worry any more
I'll be your baby tonight

Shut the light - shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight

Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
We're gonna let it - you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off - do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight

Be my baby
Be my baby
Be my baby
Be my baby
I'll be your baby tonight

Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
We're gonna let it - you won't regret it

Kick your shoes off - do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight

Be my baby
Be my baby
Be my baby
Be my baby
I'll be your baby tonight
I'll be your baby tonight
I'll be your baby tonightYou might also likeEmbed
