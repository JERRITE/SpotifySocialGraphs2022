Seventeen Lyrics[BETTY]
Fine, we're damaged, really damaged
But that does not make us wise
We're not special, we're not different
We don't choose who lives or dies
Let's be normal, see bad movies
Sneak a beer and watch TV
We'll bake brownies or go bowling
Don't you want a life with me?
Can't we be seventeen?
That's all I want to do
If you could let me in
I could be good with you
[JUGHEAD]
People hurt us

[BETTY]
Or they vanish

[JUGHEAD]
And you're right, that really blows

[BETTY]
But we let go

[JUGHEAD]
Take a deep breath

[BETTY]
Then go buy some summer clothes

[JUGHEAD]
We'll go camping

[BETTY]
Play some poker

[JUGHEAD]
And we'll eat some chili fries
You might also like[BETTY]
Maybe prom night, maybe dancing

[TONI & BETTY]
Don't stop looking in my eyes

[CHERYL & JUGHEAD]
Your eyes

[BETTY & JUGHEAD]
Can't we be seventeen
Is that so hard to do?

[CHERYL & TONI]
If you could let me in
I could be good with you

[BETTY & JUGHEAD]
Let us be seventeen
If we still got the right

[TONI]
So what's it gonna be?
I wanna be with you

[ALL]
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you tonight
[BETTY]
Yeah, we're damaged

[JUGHEAD]
Badly damaged

[BETTY & JUGHEAD]
But your love's too good to lose

[CHERYL]
Hold me tighter, even closer

[TONI]
I'll stay if I'm what you choose

[BETTY & JUGHEAD]
Can we be seventeen?

[CHERYL & TONI]
If I am what you choose

[BETTY & JUGHEAD]
If we still have the right

[CHERYL]
'Cause you're the one I choose

[TONI]
You're the one I choose

[ALL]
You're the one I choose3Embed
