I Still Need You LyricsI know it's been forever now
And you have probably figured out
That your life is even better
Without me

And I don't blame you for your choices
I'm just hoping that you'll see
That I'll always have these moments
In my mind

And do you think of me now and then
Or am I just a distant memory
That you will soon forget
Well..
I still need you
And I still love you
And I don't wanna see you walk out of that door when I say
I still need you
And I still feel you

And I don't wanna see you walk out of that door when I say
And I still need you
And I still loved you
And I don't wanna see you walk out of that door when I say
I still hear you
And I still feel you

And I don't wanna see you walk out of that door when I say
I still need youYou might also like3Embed
