TranslationsPortuguêsDeutschMy Limb Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you gotta amputate, don't give me the tourniquet
You wish that I would run away, sever what isn't working
But I'll let my body bleed out, leaning to my left side
If your part of me is gone now, do I wanna survive?

[Chorus]
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Let go)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb
[Verse 2]
Funny, of the two of us, you always were the gentle one
Shy little rabbit, teething on a shotgun
Guess we were collateral damage, kissing in the crossfire
Limpin' over dead leaves, I wish that they would cover me

[Chorus]
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Let go)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't let go)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't lеt go)

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Don't, don't let go my limb
Don't, don't let go my limb (Don't let go)

[Chorus]
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't lеt go my limb)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)
My limb, my limb, my limb, my limb, my limb (Don't, don't let go my limb)
(Don't let go my)
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go my)You might also like3Embed
