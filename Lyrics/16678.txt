Johnny Cool (2021 Remaster) Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
This is the ballad of Johnny Cool

[Verse 1]
He was singing rough rock
Driving a smooth Rolls
Bought a big house
Sold a good soul
Had a good time just to blow up his gold
[Chorus]
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool

[Verse 2]
Well, he made the right move, met the right friend
(Like he wanted)
Hit the right road, caught the right trend
(What he wanted)
Broke all the rules that he could not bend

[Chorus]
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool

[Bridge]
Johnny Cool drank fifty slugs of whiskey a day
Johnny Cool was fast and loose
Johnny Cool was always up on top of the world
Flying like a rocking goose
(You ever seen a goose fly?)

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Johnny cool got busted 'cause he trusted a fool
Johnny Cool went on the run
Johnny Cool could do just what he wanted to do
Johnny Cool could carry a gun (Bad news)
You might also like[Verse 3]
You know he made the wrong move, met the wrong friend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)-
Hit the wrong road, turned the wrong bend
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)-
Picked up that gun and blew out his brain

[Chorus]
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool
He was rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool

[Outro]
Mmm, Johnny Cool
Yeah, Johnny Cool
Mmm, you got to go, you got to go
Johnny Cool
Mmm, rock and roll, do your thing
Whatever it is you might turn out to be king
Johnny Cool
Mmm, move, move it, move, move it
Move, move it, Johnny Cool
Mmm, Johnny Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool
Mhm, Johnny Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool
Hey, yah, yah, Johnny CoolEmbed
