Kill the Noise Lyrics[Intro]
I just feel like I'm channeling something
Kill the noise

[Verse 1]
No love, no feelings
I choke on the air I'm breathing
Undone, unhealing
Ain't nobody stopping the bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
Deaf with demons on both sides
Can't think, no angel left insight
Chained to this static in my mind
And I can't hide
[Chorus]
This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free fall into grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise
Kill the noise

[Verse 2]
My scars keep screamin'
I live through the pain for a reason
My god, my anger
It drags me down like an anchor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm deaf with demons on both sides
Can't think, no angel left insight
Chained to this static in my mind
And I can't hide

[Chorus]
This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free fall into grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise

Shut up
Shut up

[Chorus]
This rage, I just can't escape
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
Free fall into grace, I'm not insane
It's time to kill the noise
Kill the noise

[Outro]
Breaking through my mistakes
Free fall into grace, I'm not insaneEmbed
