Heroes (we could be) Lyrics[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, thatâ€™s where we run

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Everyday people do everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything
[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it 'cause they don't understand
Spinnin' 'round and 'round for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Everyday people do everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Bridge: Tove Lo]
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes (Oh)
We could be heroes, me and you (Oh)
We could be70Embed
