Aye, Cyber Goth, logging off, G2G, L-M-A-O
If you need me, I'm on the road, still don't know which way to go
I don't need a place to stay, but I got no place to call my home
If you see me, don't come my way 'cause I will swiftly let you go

[Verse 1]
In these shadows, I control, I could never have to hope
Only make it happen like I have been, I've been on a roll
I could never stop because options just keep on popping
Up into my field of vision, I pick 'em up with precision
Now people want my attention, I don't get it so please just stop it
It's funny how they see some numbers and now they start taking interest
My DPS the highest, my k/d/a Is the finest
XIII, the Assassin is always taking new clients, huh?

Aye, Cyber Goth, logging off, G2G, L-M-A-O
If you need me, I'm on the road, still don't know which way to go
I don't need a place to stay, but I got no place to call my home
If you see me, don't come my way 'cause I will swiftly let you go

[Verse 2]
Please let it go, please let it go
I'll leave you with no reason to hope
Everybody think I'm so reachable
I don't really think that's reasonable
They didn't want me in the game, I hacked the files, cracked the code
And modified the database and added a lane all on my own
Airplane mode stay on my phone, I don't want to hear a soul
Airplane mode stay on my phone, I don't want to hear a soul
Airplane mode stay on my phone, I don't want to hear a soul
Airplane mode stay on my phone, I don't want to hear a soulYou might also like3Embed
