Love Is An Open Door Lyrics[Intro, spoken: Anna and Hans]
Okay, can I just - say something crazy?
I love crazy!

[Verse 1: Anna and Hans]
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
I was thinking the same thing!
'Cause, like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue...
[Pre-Chorus 1: Anna and Hans, Both]
But with you (But with you)
I found my place (I see your face)
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

[Chorus 1: Anna and Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Love is an open door
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door

[Verse 2: Anna and Hans, Both]
I mean it's crazy (What?)
We finish each others'â€”
Sandwiches!
That's what I was gonna say!
I never met someone who thinks so much like me
Jinx. Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation
You and I were just meant to be!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anna and Hans, Both]
Say goodbye (Say goodbye) to the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore
You might also like[Chorus 2: Anna and Hans, Both]
Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Life can be so much more
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door (Door)

[Outro, spoken: Anna and Hans]
Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something even crazier?
Yes!12Embed
