Back To The Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say you don't wanna go
But you've got to understand
That you're so far away from me
And I'm all alone, even when you're standing next to me
Deep inside, I feel you want to go free

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted you
Eternally
But I see the truth
Now that you lie to me
[Chorus]
Can't you see that, the pain, it breaks me in two?
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart
Baby, please make it stop and be mine again
So we can take it right back to the moment where we started

Take it right back, baby
Take it right back, woman

[Verse 2]
And baby, you say you already know
Ooh, but you won't ever understand
What it's like to feel you slippin' away from me
I'm down on my knees
Even though I tried to carry on
Deep inside, I feel like I'm the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted you
Eternally
But I see the truth
Now that you lie to me
Oh and you lie to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Can't you see that, the pain, it breaks me in two?
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart
Baby, please make it stop and be mine again
So we can take it right back to the moment where we start

[Bridge]
I feel like you're taking away my everything (My everything)
'Cause everything you say and do, it's like you're playing a part
When the curtain finally closes
I wonder if you're gonna take a bow before you break my heart
Before you break my heart
Oh

[Solo]

Now, listen to me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that, the pain, it breaks me in two?
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart
Baby, please make it stop and be mine again
(So we can take it right back to the moment)
Can't you see that the pain breaks me in two?
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart
Baby, please make it stop and be mine again
(So we can take it right back to the moment)
Can't you see that the pain breaks me in two?
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart
Baby, please make it stop and be mine again
(So we can take it right back to the moment)
Can't you see that the pain...
Can't you see that the pain...
Can't you see that the pain...
Can't you see that the pain...
Can't you see that the pain...Embed
