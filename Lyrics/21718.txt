TranslationsEspañolNEW SHOES Lyrics[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Still banging with the crew I came with
Westside Bad Boy, I can't explain it
Sipping on Don, nigga love being faded
Sitting on fours, living outrageous
Look at my dogs, they got us in cages
Look at my palms, the riches is crazy
Look at my life, living amazing
Came out the closet and ended up famous and rich
You bitch, you'll never see me complain again
Came from the bottom, was living with friends
Making it work, chasing them ends
Niggas was dog walking and job tossing
That hard lesson, came far from Austin
Never stop flossing, never stop bragging
Got me a uh, got me a present
Uh, uh, shit wasn't magic
That dedication, hard work's an understatement
Niggas was slaving
Thirty mothеrfuckers in the group, go 'head, baby, imaginе them statements
Imagine them splits, living like this, living like this
Living like this, living like this, living like this
Living like, living like, living like
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I wanna live in the south of Korea
I want a crib in Japan by Osaka
Lay on the beach in the Caymans for summer
And I want a spot where my neighbor's Obama
Sipping on something extra juicy
Man, you call it that citric fluid
AC off, this bitch so hot
I think she need some premium coolant
Hit your block, call me (Been around the world)
Eating that good good (Michelin star)
I'm so high, I been out of my mind
On a pillow checking out property on Mars
Oh, man, oh man, them old blocks can't slow me down
Goddamn, goddamn, I think I need to tone it down
Diamonds like water, I call 'em Cthulhu
She is a huh like Da Vinci drew her
If I'm doing magic, I'm swapping the bunny
'Cause I wanna pull a lil' bat out the hat
Bat out of hell, that's what I'm on
Red light on, young Amsterdam
If she ask you where you been
Pull out that passport, check the stamps

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa & Merlyn Wood]
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways, racks stacked away
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways (Racks stacked away)
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy (Merlyn)

I got a force (Force), it's pouring out my pores (Yes, sir)
Shippin' is first, that's just a matter of course (What?)
Never been broke, always been hard on myself (Holy)
Why lie? Niggas lie and win awards (On God)
Don't play yourself, that's a suicidal sport (On God)
Clout, but don't know yourself, what a curse (What a curse)
Clouds never block my shine, records show (Fuck up)
Why lie? Contract from Diablo (Bitch)
I sold everything but pussy and my soul

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa & Merlyn Wood]
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways, racks stacked away
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways (Racks stacked away)
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I set my tribe in, tribe in, ain't no complying-'plying
We can't be minus, minus, I must be biased, biased
Adjust your iris, iris, if you can't find us, find us
My pan been frying, frying, I cook the finest, finest
Bitch, I'm wildin', wildin', I might get violent, violent
Ain't no more trying, trying, you mad I'm styling, styling
My mom need islands, islands, my hood grew diamonds, diamonds
I kept on mining, mining, now I'm providing-'vidingEmbed
