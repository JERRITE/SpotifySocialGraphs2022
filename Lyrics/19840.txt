Stockholm Lights Lyrics[Verse 1]
A pair of jeans, a shirt or two
We didn't pack as if we weren't going back
It doesn't matter if it's true
I've got a feeling love will give us what we lack

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is waiting up
The world is waiting half a step beyond our door, yeah
And if it's not enough
I wanna see the stuff the world has got in store
[Chorus]
I wanna take it all in, I'm fallin'
This cityscape by night
Wanna catch in my photos, where you go
Every corner twice as bright
They'll be my treasures, forever
When I can't hold you tight
I'll see the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights

[Post-Chorus]
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow feels a year away
Like this second's the beginning and the end
But if in time it's yesterday
Your picture's gonna bring it home to me again

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is waiting up
The world is waiting half a step beyond our door, oh-oh
And if it's not enough
I wanna see the stuff the world has got in store
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna take it all in, I'm fallin'
This cityscape by night
Wanna catch in my photos, where you go
Every corner twice as bright
They'll be my treasures, forever
When I can't hold you tight
I'll see the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights

[Post-Chorus]
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights

[Outro]
I'll see the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lights, the Stockholm lights
The Stockholm lightsEmbed
