More Than Machines Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't step on my toes, let the weather go
It's been a long wait in bed
Say what, we blow, let's go, this is the time to shine
Everything wrong should be right
Girls, you in control
Not the government, not the government

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing changes, never stops (Say what?)
Breathe
[Chorus]
We are more than machines, we are because we feel
When everything goes down, it is how we come around
We are more than a dream, but this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now, you are everything to me
More than machines (More than machines)
More than machines

[Verse 2]
Don't forget the code, let the wind blow
You can't be assured, of a window
Shame, bro, we know, you foe
Here is the news in blood
Everything wrong should be right
The earth dies
It's a money thing, it's a money thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing changes, never stops (Say what?)
Breathe

[Chorus]
We are more than machines, we are because we feel
When everything goes down, it is how we come around
We are more than a dream, but this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now, you are everything to me
More than machines (More than machines)
More than machines
You might also like[Chorus]
We are more than machines, we are because we feel
When everything goes down, it is how we come around
We are more than a dream, but this heart is made of steel
I said I need you now, you are everything to me
More than machines (More than machines)
More than machines (More than machines)
More than machines (More than machines)
More than machinesEmbed
