​everything sucks (feat. Eric Nam) Lyrics[Intro: vaultboy]
Ha

[Verse 1: vaultboy]
Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is great, no really
I haven't thought about my ex today
Oh, wait–(Fuck, I just did)
But I went outside for the first time
In a few days and it felt nice
And I might try doing exercise (Haha, not really)
[Chorus: vaultboy]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say

[Verse 2: Eric Nam]
Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is better than it used to be
I didn't write a song about my ex today
(This doesn't count, ha)
But I called my friends and I told them
We should hang out if it makes sense
'Cause I miss them and I hate being alone (Oh, really?)

[Chorus: vaultboy & Eric Nam]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say

[Outro: vaultboy & Eric Name]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
Everything sucks
Just kiddingYou might also likeEmbed
