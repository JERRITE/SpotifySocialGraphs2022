Coming Home (Oregon) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I headed out
Down interstate 5
My money was all spent
But I felt so alive
I was chasing down the dream
Like you always thought me to
But the evergreens and caffeine
Still remind me of you

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to the place that I remember
Back to the land of my first love
Would you spread wide your arms for this wayward son?
I left my heart in Oregon
I left my heart in Oregon
[Verse 2]
Well the Northwest air brings the fast boys to town
Be like fire on the Cascades
When our feet touch the ground

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to the place that I remember
Back to the land of my first love
Would you spread wide your arms for this wayward son?
I left my heart in Oregon
I left my heart in Oregon

[Bridge]
Cause in my mind is a memory
Tastes so good, it's bittersweet
Of cheap champagne and a victory

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to the place that I remember
Back to the land of my first love
Would you spread wide your arms for this wayward son?
I left my heart in Oregon
I left my heart in Oregon

[Outro]
Oh, I left my heart in Oregon
Yeah, I left my heart in OregonYou might also likeEmbed
