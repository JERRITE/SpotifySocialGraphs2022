Tightrope Lyrics[CHARITY]
Some people long for a life that is simple and planned
Tied with a ribbon
Some people won't sail the sea 'cause they're safer on land
To follow what's written
But I'd follow you to the great unknown
Off to a world we call our own
Hand in my hand
And we promised to never let go
We're walkin' a tightrope
High in the sky
We can see the whole world down below
We're walkin' a tightrope
Never sure, never know how far we could fall
But it's all an adventure
That comes with a breathtakin' view
Walkin' a tightrope
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you
Mountains and valleys, and all that will come in between
Desert and ocean
You pulled me in and together we're lost in a dream
Always in motion
So I risk it all just to be with you
And I risk it all for this life we choose

Hand in my hand
And you promised to never let go
We're walkin' a tightrope
High in the sky
We can see the whole world down below
We're walkin' a tightrope
Never sure, will you catch me if I should fall?
Well, it's all an adventure
That comes with a breathtakin' view
Walkin' a tightrope
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, oh
With youYou might also like20Embed
