Honey Sweet Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm out, will she love me?
I'm still seeing honey sweet
You shout 'don't you leave me'
'Don't you leave this incomplete'

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know if this road
Belongs to my eyes and only mine

[Chorus]
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet, honey sweet
[Verse 2]
I'm out, I heard a heavy creek
Behind my window, honey sweet
There's no doubt you still love me
You'd still love this incomplete

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know if this road
Belongs to my eyes and only mine

[Chorus]
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet, honey sweet

[Bridge]
Teardrops stain skies of thunder
Autumn pain, change my number
I've seen you two about
And talk about rebounding

[Chorus]
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet
Then I'd go back and show my love
A heart attack, I'm told I should have known
No more nights alone, so cold
Let's go back discreet
