Overplayed Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought I heard you laugh in my car
'Cause I played our song, but she sang your favorite part
For a minute I thought it was you
And I wish it was, to tell you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I sleep over on weekends, her dad lets me stay
I jump in the pool first so she can feel safe
I know we said forever, but now forever's gone away
[Chorus]
'Cause you said you'd rather be alone
And that's just how it goes
We were better than what movies say
But now our story's overplayed, played

[Verse 2]
What do you do when you hear our song?
Do you listen and cry?
Or do you quickly turn it off?
I wish sometimes you'd tell me that you're sorry
I wish I was next to you
And I shouldn't be texting you

[Pre-Chous]
Now I sleep over on weekends, her dad lets me stay
I jump in the pool first so she can feel safe
I know we said forever, but now forever's gone away

[Chorus]
'Cause you said you'd rather be alone
And that's just how it goes
We were better than what movies say
But now our story's overplayed, played

[Bridge]
The photos, the memories
I can't believe they're killing me
I'm sorry you're sorry
But where are we?
Your necklace, my T-shirt
Your eyes when you told me this won't hurt
Where are we?
Where are we?
Where are we?
You might also like[Outro]
Now I sleep over on weekends, her dad lets me stay
I jump in the pool first so she can feel safe
I know we said forever, but now forever's gone away
You said you had to be alone
And that's just how it goesEmbed
