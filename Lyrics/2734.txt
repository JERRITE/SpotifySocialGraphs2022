Like Lovers Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you watching me
Eyes on your target
Mix drinks and smoke rings
It's already started
It won't be too long before me and you
Are doing what lovers do

[Verse 2]
Clothes on the floor
We're exploring our bodies
Getting you off is my new favorite hobby
Lipstick on your neck brands like a tattoo
Cause that just how lovers do
[Chorus]
Ooh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Ooh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

[Verse 3]
His and hers closets are perfect for skeletons
Hiding resentment and shared infedelities
Cheers to regret, wash it down with some booze
Drinking like lovers do

[Chorus]
Ooh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Ooh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

[Bridge]
That's how it goes
So take care like a grown-up
Life's not a fairytale, it's hard to own up
Hire a hitman to take care of you
And end it like lovers do

[Chorus]
Ooh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Ooh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do
You might also like[Outro]
I see you watching me
Eyes on your target
Mix drinks and smoke rings, it's already started
Let's roll the dice and we'll both make our moves
