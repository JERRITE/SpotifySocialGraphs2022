Sad Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Poured myself a warm glass, and laid awake
I prayed the Lord my soul to take

[Verse 2]
I thought about you all day
How we have the same face
I fell asleep so confused
Parts of me remind me of you
How could I ever wish away?
[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream

[Bridge]
I wake up and I hear my phone ring
I hear your call and I let my phone ring
When I got into my car and drove away
I listened to the stereo play

[Verse 3]
I live by my own laws
Stick to my guns, hold my head up to the midnight sun
Hope the guilt will dim and fade
A fire baptism engulfed my shame

[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
And I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dreamYou might also like13Embed
