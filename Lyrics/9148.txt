The Bitter Pill LyricsSometimes I'm lost
And then I'm found
Sometimes I feel
Turned inside out
I'm often silent when I'm screaming inside

Instead of love
We tend to hate
We never quite
Appreciate
How much the other person cares or tries
Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
'Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

And when I'm right
I'm also wrong
We give and take
To get along
There's so much more to this than I ever dreamed

And when you smile
I have to laugh
And when you cry
I'm torn in half
So calm and yet so loose at the seams, oh
You might also likeHold me close
Don't ever let me go
I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

Liebe kann eine bittere Pille sein
Eine bittere Pille
Liebe ist eine bittere Pille
Eine bittere Pille
Liebe kann eine bittere Pille sein

Ich will ein Bier
Ich will besoffen sein
Die ganze Welt ist dumm
Mir steht es so im Hals
Ich sage dir
Die liebe kann nur luge sein
[Solo]

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
'Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains, it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door?
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill
Or a bitter pillEmbed
