Brighten LyricsSolemn drifter
You have your days
And all these wonders
Never took your pain away

Magnifiers turn your
Sunshine to hell
Time you leave this place
You know all so well

Brighten
Brighten
Better angels
But you don't pray
Push back on the darkness
In which you damn well like to play

Now you find yourself
In the same boat again
Going out alone on this ocean
Not if, but when

Brighten
Brighten

Only reap what you sow
Only reap what you sow

All your love has
Not gone to waste
Shine like starlight
Leading home from thе edge of space

Magnifiеrs turn your
Sunshine to hell
Time you leave this place
You know all so well

Only reap what you sow
Only reap what you sow
Only reap what you sow
Only reap what you sow
