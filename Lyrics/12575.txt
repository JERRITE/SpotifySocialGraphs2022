Landlocked Surf Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]
Motorcycles, denim jeans, neon lights, Tennessee
Ten bucks for a beer at every bar
Singing "Buddy Holly" at the naked karaoke
With a 58 and phoney southern draw

[Chorus]
Gotta love that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Makes your head bop, head bop
Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop
Yeah, that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Keeps me dreaming of the day when I'm gonna get my star
[Verse 2]
Yeah, some California techie in a cowboy hat is dancing
By himself beneath the disco ball
While the preacher's outside smoking
Sharing Jesus with the homeless
On his way to get a tattoo on his arm

[Chorus]
Gotta love that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Makes your head bop, head bop
Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop
Yeah, that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Keeps me dreaming of the day when I'm gonna get my star

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Gotta love that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Makes your head bop, head bop
Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop
Yeah, that landlocked surf rockabilly kind of feeling
Keeps me dreaming of the day when I'm gonna get my starYou might also like1Embed
