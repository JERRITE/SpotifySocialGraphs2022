Walk Hand in Hand LyricsWalk hand in hand with me
Through all eternity
Have faith, believe in me
Give me your hand

Love is a symphony
Of perfect harmony
When lovers such as we
Walk hand in hand

Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while
Lift your head up high and look towards the sky
Walk hand in hand with me
This is our destiny
No greater love could be
Give me your hand, walk with me

Walk hand in hand with me
This is our destiny
No greater love could be
Give me your hand, walk with meYou might also likeEmbed
