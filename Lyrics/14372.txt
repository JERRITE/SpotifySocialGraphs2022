Covers Lyrics[Intro: Paolo Nutini]
Yep!

[Verse 1: Paolo Nutini]
I pull my covers off my lady in the night
To see the cold reaction when she realises actions I've taken
To start conversation

[Verse 2: Kyle Falconer]
They tell me hope that really pulls the strings the most
Clever little words from the boring little boy in the corner
We love one another
[Chorus: Kyle Falconer & Paolo Nutini]
I never asked you to come here
And no one asked you to come here
They're saying words people don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear
So stop shouting

[Verse 3: Paolo Nutini]
A piece of mind it carries tension up the stream
The truth can pierce a hole right through the dingy little boat you sailed in on
And the one you'll go down on

[Verse 4: Kyle Falconer & Paolo Nutini]
Oh what an awful way to throw away the day
Your season is colliding with the evil massive things you're providing
No way you can hide in

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer & Paolo Nutini]
No one asked you to come here
No one asked you to come here
They're saying words that we don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear
So stop shouting

[Chorus: Kyle Falconer & Paolo Nutini]
I never asked you to come here
And no one asked you to come here
They're saying things that we don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear, we don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear, we don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear, we don't wanna hear
We don't wanna hear-

[Verse 5: Kyle Falconer]
Exceptions are creative in your sister's way
Your mother won't approve of these newfound days
Think of no one but your little selfish mind
And always think of no one

[Verse 1: Paolo Nutini & Kyler Falconer]
I pull my covers off my lady in the night
To see the cold reaction when she realises actions have taken (actions have taken)
To start conversation
To start conversationEmbed
