​since​ i was young (win and woo remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Wrabel & Kesha]
Nobody knows what it means
You just go and you hope that you'll grow, that's life
My whole life philosophy
Oh, it changes with the tide

[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel]
I was like sixteen smokin' a cigarette for the first time
Tryin' so hard to impress some guy or some girl, I forget
Twenty-nine, I'd never thought I'd be
Twenty-nine, the years just follow me
Some nights, I still don't understand it
[Chorus: Wrabel & Kesha]
Since I was young
I always tried to cover up
Who I was and who I love
Then I got older
Since I was young
I always thought that twenty-five
Would be the last year of my life
Thеn I got sober
And now I'm more myself than I ever was
I'm happier than I ever was
And I learned to let someone love me for me
Oh, since I was young
Always been the weird one out
Fucking up that little town
And I've been this way
Since I was young
Since I was young
Since I was young

[Verse 2: Wrabel & Kesha]
Babe, ain't it so bittersweet
Knowin' all of the beautiful things will go?
So I wanna feel this shit deep
Every feeling, every heartbreak, every high and every low

I was like eighteen, City of Angels, drinking codeine
Swear I saw a demon in my backseat
Oh, those Laurel Canyon nights
Now I'm twenty-nine, I never thought I'd be
Still alive, someone's watchin' out for me
Maybe I'll never understand it

[Chorus: Wrabel & Kesha]
Since I was young
I always tried to cover up
Who I was and who I love
Then I got older (Oh, I got older)
Since I was young
I always thought that twenty-five
Would be the last year of my life
Then I got sober
And now I'm more myself than I ever was
I'm happier than I ever was
And I learned to let someone love me for me (Oh, oh)
Oh, since I was young (Young, hey, hey)
Always been the weird one out
Fucking up that little town
And I've been this way
Since I was young
[Post-Chorus: Wrabel & Kesha]
Woah, oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Woah, oh-oh-oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Since I was young
Woah, oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Woah, oh-oh-oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Since I was young
Since I was youngEmbed
