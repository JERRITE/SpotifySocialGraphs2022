Far Away Blues LyricsOh the weather ain't so fine today
Darling it's just right for me
'Cause I've been thinking of you
Got these far away blues

Oh the water's mad
She's been fighting with the wind
I've been thinkin' of you
Got these far away blues

So please don't take me the wrong way
Things are fine and people are great, but
I've been thinking of you
Got these far away blues
