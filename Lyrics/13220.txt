What Are We Gonna Do Now Lyrics[Chorus]
What are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do, baby?
Saw you sleeping outside with a red nose
Saw you sleeping in bed with your day clothes on
What are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do, sweetheart?

[Verse 1]
You still haven't cleaned the kitchen
And we're still on hold with the nurses
[Post-Chorus]
When are we gonna wake up
In some cubicle cell with our shirts tucked?
I'll be the one
I'll be the one to deliver the news

[Bridge]
I know you're worn, you're exhausted
This is love, this is lost on you
I'm holding my night
In your hands
And there's nothing like trying
I'm so loud in the mornings

[Hook]
And I'm never cooking up what you're craving
I'm never cooking up what you're craving

[Verse 2]
Oh, my darling
Just this once won't ya?
Hold me closer
Tell me I'm all that you need!

[Hook]
I'm never cooking up what you're craving
I'm never cooking up what you're craving
You might also like[Chorus]
What are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do, sweetheart?
Sleeping outside with a red nose
Sleeping in bed with our day clothes on

[Post-Chorus]
When are we gonna wake up
In some cubicle cell with our shirts tucked?
I'll be the one
I'll be the one to deliver the news5Embed
