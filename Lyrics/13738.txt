Kick out the epic motherf**ker - vocal version LyricsKick out the epic, motherfucker [4x]

Emergency call, this is a code red
Put your hands up high, put 'em in the air
You know what we do and we do it well
In a world full of lies we live to tell
[2x]

Oh all the years that you've been feeding all that trash you wasted time
Kick out the epic, motherfucker [4x]You might also likeEmbed
