We Should Be Sorry LyricsWe were young
Never silent
Didn’t think that we’d ever be
We were strong
Never tired
The only true certainty

But the leaves came falling down
On our holy ground
We had a shelter, we were safe
Why didn’t we stay?
Now it’s too late, we should be sorry
For the way we ended our story
We walked away
We didn’t try hard enough
We gave up

Now it’s too late, we should be sorry
Cause the blame’s on you and on me
We walked away
We didn’t try hard enough
We gave up
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry

It was deep
Like an ocean
We were drowning in afterglow

But the leaves came falling down
On our holy ground
We had a shelter, we were safe
Why didn’t we stay

For the way we ended our story
We walked away
We didn’t try hard enough
We gave up

Now it’s too late, we should be sorry
Cause the blame’s on you and on me
We walked away
We didn’t try hard enough
We gave up
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorry
We should be sorryEmbed
