I Wonâ€™t Pay Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I see nothing wrong with the range life
Better than the horror of caged tight
I see you at the bar, out drink you
I see you the doctor, out shrink you

[Chorus]
And I don't need the car or the cave
No brat, no stable of whores
I won't pay
For that I won't pay
[Verse 2]
And I know I am more than the name I'm
Breaking down the door just to save time
I see you after school, out think you
I see you in the bedroom, out kink you
But no I didn't ask for this
So take it back
My money ain't my master, miss
Watch it go from red to black to black to black

[Chorus]
Cause I don't need the car or the cave
No brat, no stable of whores
I won't pay
For that
I won't pay (x8)

[Verse 3]
And I don't need the car or the cave
Or the brat, or the stable of whores
Or the weed, or the rash, or the same fucking story
I worry am I slowly going to turn into something I hate
Fuck that
I won't payYou might also likeEmbed
