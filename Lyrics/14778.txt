I Love You More Than You Think Lyrics[Verse 1: Jordan]
My bodys got a switch-off mechanism
I can switch off from any given opportunity
To tell you what I really feel like
See me, I'm unaffected by real life
Yeah, I watched Titanic and I didn't cry
I watched Pearl Harbor and I didn't cry
I watched AI and I cried, but I don't know why
That was weird, and it was years ago
Let's move on from that...
I've realized sometimes I'm terrible
I've done things out of fear of the inevitable
There's been times when I've talked from my genitals
Or we've warred intellectually
Tried to pull the other off their pedestal
And yeah, I do win arguments so face it
And you hate that I love it, but you hate it
Then I forget to remind you of your greatness
And I never want you feeling unappreciated
[Hook: Harley]
And I, I, I, I, I-I-I
I love you more than you think
I love you more than you think
And I, I, I, I, I-I-I
I love you more than you think
I love you
I-I love you

[Verse 2: Jordan]
I know there's been times when you've questioned my interest
Things have been said in jest
Accept I was never gonna treat you like a princess
Things got too intense
I didn't always wanna be there when you beckoned, I
Struggled with feelings inside
But believe that I'd be there in a second
If I was ever needed by your side, alright
I think that we know that we know each other really well
I know I wanna know you for the rest of my life
Because no matter the length of time that's gone by
When I see you, it's fine
It's like I just saw you last night
And there's times when I've acted stupid
I suppose I'm just learning, it's different
But nothing is useless
I know that I love you without any terms or conditions
You might also like[Hook: Harley]

[Outro: Harley]
All I want is for you to be there
All I want is for you, you to be there
