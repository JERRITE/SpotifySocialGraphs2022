Possum Kingdom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Make up your mind
Decide to walk with me
Around the lake tonight
Around the lake tonight
By my side
By my side

[Verse 2]
I'm not gonna lie
I'll not be a gentleman
Behind the boathouse
I'll show you my dark secret
[Verse 3]
I'm not gonna lie
I want you for mine
My blushing bride
My lover, be my lover, yeah

[Verse 4]
Don't be afraid
I didn't mean to scare you
So help me Jesus

[Verse 5]
I can promise you
You will stay as beautiful
With dark hair
And soft skin
Forever
Forever

[Verse 6]
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
And I'll promise you
I will treat you well
My sweet angel
So help me Jesus
Hey, hey, yeah

Give it up to me
Give it up to me
Do you wanna be
My angel?
Give it up to me
Give it up to me
Do you wanna be
My angel?
Give it up to me
Give it up to me
Do you wanna be
My angel?
So help me!

[Outro]
Be my angel
Be my angel
Be my angel
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna die?!
Do you wanna die?!
Do you wanna die?!
Do you wanna die
Well I promise you
I will treat you well
My sweet angel
So help me Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
