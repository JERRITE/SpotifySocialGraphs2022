The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere

[Verse 2]
The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

[Bridge]
And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone
Alone

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, do, do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
