Hollow Tune LyricsNot born a fool, But I've found my door
Heard from the dead, when I was born
My weakened pulse and my blood shot eyes
A one way street to nowhere

Neon lights so soft like blankets
Sing a smile in a secret language
Love I know just like the ocean

A hollow tune, within the fire
I feel and breathe, so uninspired
My broken hands, my weary bones
I sit my words beside my throne
You're not alone, I'm not alone
Can you hear me from there?
You're not alone
I'm lost again, but I'm still alive
Your broken heart I sacrificed
I'm sorry for all that I've done
To find my voice;
I'm someone

Neon lights so soft like blankets
Sing a smile in a secret language
Love I know just like the ocean

A hollow tune, within the fire
I feel and breathe, so uninspired
My broken hands, my weary bones
I sit my words beside my throne
You're not alone, I'm not alone
Can you hear me from there?
You're not alone

Forever! (Forever)
Forever now we can live!
Forever! (Our hearts here)
Forever now we can live!
Forever!
Tell me when you're ready we can talk again
Forever now we can live!
Forever!
Show me
Are you real or are you just pretend?
Forever now we can live!

Sing a smile in a secret language
Love I know just like the ocean

A hollow tune, within the fire
I feel and breathe, so uninspired
My broken hands, my weary bones
I sit my words beside my throne
You're not alone, I'm not alone
Can you hear me from there?
You're not aloneEmbed
