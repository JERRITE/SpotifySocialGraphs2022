​​hate to be you Lyrics[Verse 1]
You promised me that you'd marry me
And we'd have a house in the hills
With five kids and a dog
If that was true then why'd you sleep
With my fucking best friend
And lied to me and your mom?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you can tell everybody to stop feeling sorry for me
'Cause I'm not the one they should feel sorry for
And all that's left to say is
[Chorus]
I'd hate to be you
'Cause I'll get over it
But you have to live with the hell you put me through
I'd hate to be you
'Cause it's not gonna hit
'Til you see that I've moved on with somebody new
And I'd hate to be you (Oh, oh-oh)
Yеah, I'd hate to be you (Oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Hope shе was worth it
'Cause you deserve it
You left forever for something that won't even last
And it's funny how you didn't cheat
With somebody hotter than me
I swear I don't mean to be mean, but

[Chorus]
I'd hate to be you
'Cause I'll get over it
But you have to live with the hell you put me through
I'd hate to be you
'Cause it's not gonna hit
'Til you see that I've moved on with somebody new
And I'd hate to be you (Oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, I'd hate to be you (Oh, oh-oh)

I'd hate to be so fucking stupid
So selfish, so clueless
To have me and lose it
It's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'd hate to be you
'Cause I'll get over it
But you have to live with the hell you put me through
I'd hate to be you
'Cause it's not gonna hit
'Til you see that I moved on with somebody new
And I'd hate to be you (Yeah, I'd hate to be you)
Yeah, I'd hate to be you (I'd hate to be you)
I'd hate to be you (I'd hate to be you)
I'd hate to be you
Yeah, I'd hate to be you
