Come Back Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Doubt, doubt, doubt
It kills everything that you love
Now, now, now
Iâ€™m losing myself on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear
[Chorus]
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

[Verse 2]
Paint-chipped skies
Nothing is ever as it seems
Behind these codeine eyes
Blind to the world in between

[Pre-Chorus]
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear

[Chorus]
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

Getaway

Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway

[Chorus]
But I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

[Outro]
