I Gotta Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want it now, I wanna know
I got to rock, I need to roll
If you can't hang with the speed I go
I'm gonna roll tonight
I want it now, I wanna know
I got to rock, I need to roll
If you can't hang with the speed I go
I'm gonna roll tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
I got to rock, I'm tellin' everybody
I need to roll, I'm sick of talkin' 'bout it
[Verse 2]
I want it now, I wanna know
I got to rock, I need to roll
If you can't hang with the speed I go
I'm gonna roll tonight
Don't wanna stop, go with the flow
Don't need a break, don't need a flow
If you can't keep with the pace I set
I'm leavin' all tonight

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
I got to rock, I'm tellin' everybody
I need to roll, I'm sick of talkin' 'bout it
I've got to rock, I'm tellin' everybody
I need to roll, I'm sick of talkin' 'bout it

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna fly, it's time to move
No slowin' down, got lots to prove
If you can't shake with the beats I make
I'm movin' on tonight
Don't wanna stop, go with the flow
Don't need a break, don't need a flow
If you can't keep with the pace I set
I'm leavin' all tonight

Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
Tonight, tonight, set this town alight, whoa
I got to rock, I'm tellin' everybody
I need to roll, I'm sick of talkin' 'bout it
I've got to rock, I'm tellin' everybody
I need to roll, I'm gonna star right nowEmbed
