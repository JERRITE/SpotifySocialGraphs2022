Opening Up Lyrics[CAL, spoken]
Jenna! What's the special pie today?

[JENNA, spoken]
Uh, deep shit blueberry bacon. 

[CAL, spoken]
Deep shit?

[JENNA, spoken]
Ye- uh, dish! Deep dish. Sorry, Cal!
[CAL, spoken]
C'mon, girl. 

[JENNA]
The day starts like the rest we've seen
Another carbon copy of an old routine

[BECKY]
Days keep coming

[DAWN]
One out, one in

[BECKY, DAWN & JENNA]
They keep coming

[CAL, spoken]
And make the coffee strong enough to chew!

[JENNA]
I don't know what I wish I had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
We've got too much to do

[BECKY & DAWN]
Too much to do
You might also like[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
All these same things
We're always

Opening up
Letting the day in
Over a cup
We'll say "Hello, how ya been?"
Looking around
Seeing the same things
Every day brings
"Hello, how ya been?"
"Thank you, come again!"
Some things never change

[BECKY]
I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But I been 'round the block and just came back again
A small town like ours ain't much
But sometimes home is where your ass ends up

[CAL]
Order up!

[DAWN]
Ordered up is how the day will find me
Everything in its place and time
And I like the way most of the days look exactly the same
[CAL]
Order up!

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
Check the clock
Tick, tick, tock

[CAL]
Don't stop!
Serve with a smile!

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
Hurry up, fill the coffee cup
And then in a while
Take a breath when you need
To be reminded that with days like these
We can only do the best we can
'Til we do it again

[CAL]
Come on, move it now!

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
Opening up
Letting the day in
Opening up
Some things never change
"Hello, how ya been?"
"Thank you, come again!"
Some things never change2Embed
