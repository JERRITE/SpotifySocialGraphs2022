TranslationsEnglishState of Wonder Lyrics[Intro]
Why are you recording?

[Verse 1: Anthony Russo]
In my head, like a melody
Laying back in this bed
Playing back what you said
And it's not really helping me
Coming down from this high
It's a dangerous ride
I'm coasting
Out of body floating
Lost in my emotions
I've been spinning slowly
[Chorus: Anthony Russo]
Try to keep my head above water
Then you go and pull me under
Crazy thing, I know I'm done for
Stuck in this state of wonder

[Drop: Anthony Russo]
Stuck in this state of wonder, yeah
Stuck in this state of wonder
(Stuck in this state of wonder)

[Verse 2: KANG DANIEL]
넌 날 미치게 해 계속 빠지게 돼 I don't care
모든 것에 대해 전부이게 돼
And I just want you right here with me
끝이 없이 우린 floating
Lost in your deep ocean 안들림 스며가 slowly

[Chorus: Anthony Russo]
Try to keep my head above water
Then you go and pull me under
Crazy thing, I know I'm done for
Stuck in this state of wonder

[Drop: Anthony Russo]
Stuck in this state of wonder, yeah
Stuck in this state of wonder
(Stuck in this state of wonder)
