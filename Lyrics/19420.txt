Get it, Got it, Go Lyrics[Hook]
Get it, got it, go
I'm mobbin out with these hoes
Im rockin out, can't stop me now, I'm all about that dough
Get it, got it, go
I'm mobbin out with these hoes
Im rockin out, can't stop me now, I'm all about that dough

[Verse 1: Moosh]
Look look
Check me out I'm just flexin'
Wilin' out while they stressin'
And I ain't tryna meet your folks
Cuz the homie don't need they blessin's
And a homie don't need they lessons
I ain't tryna get asked no questions
I'm tryna let it burn
I don't wanna hear your confessions
We fucked up, we ain't sober girl
I got one cup, this ain't soda girl
When them lights down, it's over girl
I like fresh prince, you like blow the girl
Goddamn you all up and away
I'm doing me you got nothing to say
When I'm in the zone you come here to slay
There's money to make, it's coming today
The homies got dank on 3-peat
Everybody got bank like TD
You don't wanna see the kid in 2k
Everybody get spank like RiRi
But it's Moosh Money stop playin' with me
Got two girls and they stayin' with me
I'm so throwed I can't think
I'm blastin' off the fam with me lets go
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twist]
I feel like the man ho
The man ho
Trick I be workin till my vans low
The fans know
Everybody wanna get it hot like that
Can't nobody make it all rock like that
I be off dome no top like that
Droplight give me that spotlight
With my crew
What it do
Said that flow hot we coo
I'ma get a team full of real young G's
All wheel drive like an SUV
If it's not real don't brag about it
We live the life and you rap about it
We heard your shit and we laughed about it
That's the fact about it get mad about it
I'ma get a big head Jimmy Neutron flow
I be like Rondo; all about the green
All about the team
Lookin' like a fiend when I rap goddamn
All about the dream
Knew the deal and she came through
Said it's not a game and she paid you
Been through this shit like I'm paid to
But I do this shit cause I'm made to
