Keep On Bringing Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a sunny day on the west coast
And currently my shades are drawn, my TV's on
I haven't left this place for days
It's funny how things change

[Pre-Chorus]
I take what I get and I throw it away and I break it
(I had everything and you took it from me and I hate it)
My thoughts run fast from me, like a lethal injection
Like a lethal injection
[Chorus]
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?
Do my best to hide it
But it keeps on bringing me down

No matter how high that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?

Keep on bringing me down?
Keep on bringing me down?

[Verse 2]
It's 5PM and I'm still locked in
And my guitar's tuned wrong, my voice is gone
I haven't seen sunlight in days
It's funny how things change

[Pre-Chorus]
I take what I get and I throw it away and I break it
(I had everything and you took it from me and I hate it)
My thoughts run fast from me, like a lethal injection
Like a lethal injection
You might also like[Chorus]
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?
Do my best to hide it
But it keeps on bringing me down

No matter how high that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?

Keep on bringing me down?
Keep on bringing me down?

[Chorus]
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?
Do my best to hide it
But it keeps on bringing me down

No matter how high that I try to climb
I'll be pulled back down again
Why does the world, as I know it
Keep on bringing me down?

Keep on bringing me down?
Keep on bringing me down?Embed
