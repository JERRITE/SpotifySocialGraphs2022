Symphonia IX Lyrics[Verse 1]
I try, I try to make you cry
Will you love me?
Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes
The need to be the best before the need to rest
Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes

[Chorus]
See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on
See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on
[Verse 2]
To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
Oh, I would say yes
Oh, I would say yes
So as you fade away alive, I lay dying
Oh, I would say
Oh, I would say yes

[Chorus]
See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go on
See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you and I won't go onYou might also like9Embed
