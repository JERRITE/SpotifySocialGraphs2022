Donâ€™t Ever Leave Lyrics[Verse 1]
Half inch fears, ready to bite
Never said you're sorry, 'cause you've always been right
Tell me I'm lame every Saturday night
'Cause you drank too many and you wanna fight
All my life, hold my breath
Wonder what trouble is coming next
Hold on tight, through this mess
Sing that song, 'cause you sing it best
La la la la
[Chorus 1]
Hey, I love it when you're spitting in my face
The way you scream when you're breaking all my things
I love the way you put me in my place
Don't ever leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Five cent heads, two bucks a pint
Always late with the rent but I never say die
Wet my bed; is it ever gonna dry?
Learn to take your shit with a big ass smile
All my life, hold my breath
Shrugging off visions of an early death
Hold on tight, through this mess
Sing that song, 'cause you sing it best
La la la la

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I love it when you're spitting in my face
The way you scream when you're breaking all my things
I love the way you put me in my place
Don't ever leave me alone
Hey, I love it when you rip my heart away
Can you hold it in my face so I can see
I love the way you bring me to my knees
Don't ever leave me alone
You might also like[Bridge]
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
Hold on...

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I love it when you're spitting in my face
The way you scream when you're breaking all my things
I love the way you put me in my place
Don't ever leave me alone
Hey, I love it when you rip my heart away
Can you hold it in my face so I can see
I love the way you bring me to my knees
Don't ever leave me aloneEmbed
