Iâ€™m Not Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1: DEAN]
I live my life like this
Tell me, how could I miss giving you everything you deserve?
You know I be doin' the most while you be back at home
I promise, baby, it could be worse
I'm out here, gettin' my money, everyday sunny
Steez on flame, I know, I know
Telling my chauffeur "Hurry up and wait"
Too-too, he be like "Too-too," time to hit that road
Zoom, you on your solo while I'm takin' photos to post
Whoo, I know you feel crazy now
[Hook: DEAN]
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just getting started and my life's a party
So I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
Said I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, I forgot about missin' you
Said I forgot about missin' you
I've been too busy out gettin' my yaper
I ain't got time to be thinkin' bout you
I've been on your mind, true
Twenty racks on my wrist
Still, I ain't got time for you
Homegirls lookin' at me like
"What's up? What's up? What's good? What's good?
Where you at right now? How long will you be on my side of town?"
Chillin' in Itaewon
Take a look at my passport now
I been gettin' that money, whoo
I ain't tryin' to hurt you but I gotta keep it 100, whoo
The whole world know me now

[Chorus: DEAN, Eric Bellinger, DEAN & Eric Bellinger]
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just getting started and my life's a party
So I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
Said I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just getting started and my life's a party
So I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
You know I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up

Girl, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
No, I ain't thinkin 'bout you
Girl, I ain't frontin', I'm really stuntin'
Just speaking the truth
Girl, you be lyin' if you said you don't see me now
Watch me go on and act a fool
Hear me when I say

[Chorus: DEAN, Eric Bellinger, DEAN & Eric Bellinger]
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just getting started and my life's a party
So I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
Said I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry
I'm just getting started and my life's a party
So I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up
You know I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' up

[Outro: DEAN, Eric Bellinger, DEAN & Eric Bellinger]
Turnin' up, turnin' up
Too busy turnin' up, turnin' up
I've been turnin' up, turnin' up
And I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry, baby
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry, babe
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry, baby
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry, baby
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry, babe23Embed
