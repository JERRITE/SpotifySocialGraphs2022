Champagne High LyricsI wasn't looking for a lifetime with you
I never thought it would hurt just to hear
"I do" and "I do"
And I do a number on myself
And all that I thought
To be
And you'll be the one
That just left me undone
By my own
Hesitation
And for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go
While your story's completed
Mine, it's a long way from done

Well I'm on a champagne high
Where will I be when I stop wonderin why
On a champagne high
High

Spring turned to summer
But then winter turned mean
The distance seemed right
At the time it was best
To leave, and to leave behind
What I once thought was fine and so real
To me
And while I'm still gone
On the quest for my song
I'm at your
Celebration

And for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go
While your story's completed
Mine, it's a long way from done
You might also likeAnd I'm on a champagne high
Where will I be when I stop wonderin why?
On a champagne high
I'd toast to the future, but that'd be a lie
On a champagne high, high

Your wagons been hitched to a star
Well now he'll be your thing that's new
Yeah what little I have you can borrow
'Cause I'm old, and I'm
Blue

Well, for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go

On a champagne high
Where will I be when I stop wonderin why
On a champagne high (so high)
Toast to the future but that'd be a lie
On a champagne high
Where will I be when I stop wonderin why
On a champagne high...high...
So high, so high you left me undone
So high, so high you left me undone...Embed
