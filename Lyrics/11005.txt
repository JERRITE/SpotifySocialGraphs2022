Edgelord Lyrics[Intro: Dorian Electra & Laura Les]
Ah, ah, push me, push me
Umru said I'm cute, goin' Full Tac

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
I'm your edgelord, I'm your edgelord
I'm so edgy, wanna F me?
Okay, F you, I don't need you
Pushing me right to the edge (Ha)

[Verse 1: Dorian Electra]
We live in a society
That's always lashing out at guys like me
They pushed me to the edge, you see
Never, never, never gonna come down
One question, why so serious?
Did I offend you? I'm so curious
Ha, my identity's mysterious
Never, never, nevеr gonna come down
(Shit, fuck)
[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
I'm your edgelord, I'm your еdgelord
I'm so edgy, wanna F me?
Okay, F you, I don't need you
Pushing me right to the edge
I'm your edgelord, I'm your edgelord
On the edge now, 'bout to jump down
Watch me jump down, taking you down
Pushing you right to the edge

[Verse 2: Rebecca Black]
Been in the game six, seven, eight, nine years
Swim fast past every crocodile tear
Feels comfy with the best seat at the table
Told you I could smash your petty trash labels
Eh, edgy life, easy like walking on air
Bet that I been doing this since daycare
Feel lucky that you ever caught a glimpse
Before I turned your favorite fuckboy to a simp

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
I'm your edgelord, I'm your edgelord
I'm so edgy, wanna F me?
Okay, F you, I don't need you
Pushing me right to the edge
I'm your edgelord, I'm your edgelord
On the edge now, 'bout to jump down
Watch me jump down, taking you down
Pushing you right to the edgeYou might also like7Embed
