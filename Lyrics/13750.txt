Hold You - Radio Edit LyricsI just want to hold you
When the music starts to play
All my fears just fade away
Cause when you hold me
Seems the night is gone
I just wanna hold you
Boy you take away the pain
You let the sun shine through the rain
Cause when you hold me
Feels like we are one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one....
When the music starts to play
I just want to hold you
When the music starts to play

I just want to hold you
When the music starts to play
All my fears just fade away
Cause when you hold me
Seems the night is gone
I just wanna hold you
Boy you take away the pain
You let the sun shine through the rain
Cause when you hold me
Feels like we are one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one....

When the music starts to play
I just want to hold you
When the music starts to play
I just want to hold you
