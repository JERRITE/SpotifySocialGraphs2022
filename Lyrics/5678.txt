Keeps Me Going Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve seen it all, yeah, yeah
I’ve been through every door
I’ve been lost, yeah, yeah, yeah
Trust me I’ve paid the cost
I’ve hit the wall, yeah, yeah
The only way left is up
I’ve seen the end of the rainbow
There was no more pot of gold

[Chorus]
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)
[Verse 2]
I’ve lost it all, yeah, yeah
With nothing to break my fall
I’m out of luck yeah, yeah, yeah
There was nowhere left to run
I’ve hit my high, I've hit my low
There was nowhere left to go
I’ve seen the end of the rainbow
There was no more pot of gold

[Chorus]
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going

Whatever that we may become
When memory betrays the young
Still I will always be yours
My shadows will become your own
Take me wherever you go
You know I'll always be yours

You're the one that keeps me going, no, no
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, no, oh

[Chorus]
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no
(Keeps me going)
It’s only you that keeps me going, no, no
(Keeps me going)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going
Oh-oh, keeps me going2Embed
