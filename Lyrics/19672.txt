Translations한국어Nerves Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I heard you're leaving town
Hey girl, it might not matter now
Hey girl, maybe it worked somehow
That’s what I tell myself
When you lie down tonight
So many times I could've held on
I still can't believe I left you alone
It tore me down to pieces, she’ll never know
How much I wished I'd never let you go
[Refrain]
Hi, how you doing?
I heard you seem to be happy now
Hi, how you doing?
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm doing fine

[Verse 2]
So you came around my house (Ooh-ooh)
And you left your marks with your fingertips
I'm sitting where you sat down (Ooh-ooh)
And now he's looking for something meaningless

[Chorus]
I’m getting, getting little nervous (Nervous)
I’m getting, getting to the surface (Surface)
I'm getting, getting little nervous (Nervous)
I’m getting, getting to the surface (Surface)

[Refrain]
Hi, how you doing?
I heard you seem to be happy now
Hi, how you doing?
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm doing fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m doing fine, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, girl, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, I swear it's not a lie
I'm doing fine, girl, I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine, I swear it's not a lie

I'm getting, getting a little nervous (Nervous)
I'm getting, getting to the surface (Surface)
I'm getting, getting little nervous (Nervous)
I'm getting, getting to the surface (Surface)

[Bridge]
He's getting a little nervous
She's getting to the surface
You got a little nervous of running back to you
When you weren't there

[Outro]
And I'm sorry
I was hurting too much to know
That you were standing right there
And I'm sorry
I will sing this song to you
To tell you I really cared
And I'm sorry
When I left you all alone
Girl, I know that wasn't fair
'Cause I loved you
He loved you, he loved you35Embed
