Slow Dive Lyrics[Verse 1]
They don't ever teach us heartache
Even though it's gonna hurt
Show me everything you've guarded
'Cause I got to know, I got to know
Tell me all you know about it
Let me see you at your worst
'Cause they don't ever teach us heartache
But I got to know, I got to know

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark, in the dark
You all pretend
I won't know who you are when we descend
Tell me, have you loved someone?
Have you ever really loved someone?
In the dark, in the dark
You'll see the light
Untether your heart so we can fly
Tell me, have you loved someone, loved someone?
[Chorus]
Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Hearts will shake, wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks
Slow dive, follow me
Always endlessly
Hearts will shake, wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Slow dive, follow me
Hearts will shake, wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

[Verse 2]
They don't ever teach us heartache
Even though it's gonna burn
Tell me where the love departed
'Cause I got to know, I got to know

[Chorus]
Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Hearts will shake, wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks
Slow dive, follow me
Always endlessly
Hearts will shake, wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

In the dark, in the dark
You won't pretend
I won't know who you are when we descend
Tell me, have you loved someone?
Have you ever really loved someone?
In the dark, in the dark
You'll see the light
Untether your heart so we can fly
Tell me have you loved someone, loved someone?
Slow dive into me

[Drop]

[Outro]
Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Slow dive follow me
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaksEmbed
