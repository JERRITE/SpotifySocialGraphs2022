Xpensive Habits Lyrics[Intro]
De toute façon tu me connais, j'aime tout ce qui est cher
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, mm, yeah
Oh, mmm, mm
Woo, woo

[Chorus]
G-wagon
I drove the Benz through Paris (Skrr)
New season savage
I make your ex embarrassed (Brrr, brrr)
I got expensive habits
I got expensive habits
You know my ting lavish
I got expensive habits
[Verse 1]
Man can't tell me 'bout being depressed, in love with a chick that's fuckin' somebody else (Ugh)
Now I just give 'em the D, in 24 hours, I'm with a whole nother girl (That's true)
I fell in love with the drip, I'm swimming in sauce, they call a nigga Michael Phelps (Drip, splash)
I took a flight to Dubai for 24 hours to cop a couple of Chanel's (Sheesh)
Cop a couple for your girl
Back in the day I was F'd up feeling so empty
Now the only time a nigga F'd up, I'm in all Fendi
I'm in Harvey Nich's cah my new bae want more Fenty (Hit it)
I was fuckin' bitches with no bread, now my dough plenty
Yeah, tell a hoe, expensive (Don't touch)
That ting ain't yours, that watch ain't yours, that whip is rented
Tell 'em we got Audi's, we got Beemer's, we got Benz's
Tell 'em that me and my gang loved black girls when that shit weren't even trending (Can't tell me 'bout peng ting)

[Chorus]
G-wagon
I drove the Benz through Paris
New season savage (Savage)
I make your ex embarrassed
I got expensive habits (Hey)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
You know my ting lavish
I got expensive habits
New keys, G-wagon (Wagon)
I drove the Benz through Paris (Skrr)
New season savage (Savage)
I make your ex embarrassed (Brrr)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
You know my ting lavish (Lavish)
I got expensive habits (Woo)

Securin' the bag, no, I don't need love (I'm good)
Went to the Rollie shop (For what?)
I dropped 30K (Bags), Then I did the OT bop (Sheesh)
We stood on our two feet, ain't nobody my bro's leeched off (We bossy)
When I put the durag on, all the women they won't keep off
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
There's a bag if I'm involved
Pick a ting and I want stroke, eenie meenie minie mo
I know drillers, I got dough
You're just tryna stay afloat, like four gorillas on a boat
Top boy summer is a go (Skrrr)

[Chorus]
G-wagon
I drove the Benz through Paris (Paris)
New season savage (Savage)
I make your ex embarrassed (Skrr, skrr)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
You know my ting lavish
I got expensive habits
New keys, G-wagon (Wagon)
I drove the Benz through Paris
New season savage (Savage)
I make your ex embarrassed
I got expensive habits (Hey)
I got expensive habits (Hey)
You know my ting lavish (Lavish)
I got expensive habits (Woo)
[Outro]
Woo
Go, go, go
Brr, brr
