TranslationsTürkçeRain Day Lyrics[Intro: All, YANGYANG, KUN]
Fallin' down all night
Drivin' down your way tonight
I don't care about the lights
Fallin' down all night (Night)
Drivin' down your way tonight
I don't care about the lights
Oh-yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: TAEIL, KUN]
Take me to that place
Back to our days where we had space
And a little more time, yeah, oh I (Oh, eh, oh)
Wish we'd never changed, had no time to waste
Spending all hours dreamin' of you
Like the rain fallin' down, for you and I
[Verse 2: TAEIL, YANGYANG, KUN]
All these memories in my mind
I can't help but fantasize it (Ah)
I don't wanna feel it
Pouring down on me, now I realize
Every moment that we've had
Was a blessing in disguise, yeah
You wanna be in love (Ooh-woah-woah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: KUN, YANGYANG, TAEIL]
All our days how big or small
How close? How far?
You made everything feel new, yeah
And I owe it all to you, babe
Take me to that place
Put it down, let it go, feel the love
Other voices singing out in the radio
We about to turn it up
Up for a minute, up for a minute
Ah, yeah (Woo)

[Chorus: All, YANGYANG, KUN]
Fallin' down all night (Woo)
Drivin' down your way tonight
I don't care about the lights (Na-na-na-na-na)
Babe, you should realize
I'ma be there whenever (Ah)
You're needing me always
Fallin' down all night
On my way to you 'cause
I'm needing you right in my eyes, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
On a rainy day I got you, babe

Girl, you made me better (Better)
The way you got me higher (Ah)
When the rain starts
You end up on my mind (Ah)
I don't wanna be missing you every day and night (Yeah, yeah)
Losing my sleep, I won't let you go (Sleep, I won't let you go)
There ain't no other way to tell you
How I'm feeling (Yeah), yeah-yeah

[Pre-Chorus: TAEIL, KUN, YANGYANG]
All our days, how big or small?
How close? How far?
(Everywhere I would go, I'll be feeling so alone)
You made everything feel new, yeah
And I owe it all to you, babe

I can feel the drip drop, we falling like a rain show
Listen up, so I can be the one to
Yeah, show you how to love

The rain got me thinking about the days we've had
I need to know, babe
Fallin' down all night
[Outro: KUN, TAEIL, All]
Take me back to you (Hey)
Just take me back to you when it rains (Oh)
I'll be waiting for the sun to shine, fallin' down all night
Take me back to you
When rain is falling down all the time
Everytime we go, fallin' down all night (Everytime)1Embed
