DEAR MISS HOLLOWAY Lyrics[Intro: Murray Matravers]
Oh, dear Miss Holloway, you're still on my mind
I reminisce about us sometimes
You started seein' someone new for a while
I read about it somewhere online

[Chorus: Murray Matravers]
Maybe in another life
We can try and roll the dice, and get it right
'Cause when there's no one else in sight
Can't help but think that we might get it right
[Verse 1: Murray Matravers]
'Cause we're forever near-misses, dodged a couple of kissеs
You were nevеr my missus but we came kinda close
I've had plenty of fishes, now you're close like my sis' is
Send the warmest of wishes but I keep hittin' the post
And you only ever message on my birthday
Or when you feel lonely, feel thirsty
And we said if we ain't married by thirty, we might

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I used to think I'd move to Hollywood and end up with a Meagan Good
Before they called me slurs, same words only Ellen would use
Heaven could use a few cool Rue motherfuckers that look like me and you
This that Tejas blues, that fairytale that came true
Way before I had a crew that let me be myself
Dangerous thoughts, but I was bright
I've been E-R-L, been D4L, even when I was on the D-L
I love my dawg with all my heart if you still can't tell
It's easy now, but from the start, it was a pretty big question, love
There was someone else in question, nah
Guess I will learn my lesson, yeah
See, you better get my blessin', ah
Feelin' more pressure, need savin' now

[Chorus: Murray Matravers]
Maybe in another life
We can try and roll the dice, and get it right
'Cause when there's no one else in sight
Can't help but think that we might get it right

Oh, dear Miss Holloway, I'm losin' my mind
I reminisce about us sometimes
You're leavin' town, I saw the "For Sale" sign
So I guess I'll see you 'round online

[Chorus: Murray Matravers]
Maybe in another life
We can try and roll the dice, and get it right
'Cause when there's no one else in sight
Can't help but think that we might get it rightEmbed
