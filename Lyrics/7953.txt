Set Me Free Lyrics[Chorus]
It's been too long
I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me free, oh
It's been too long
And I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me free

[Buildup]
It's been too long
It's been too long
[Drop]
It's been too long

[Post-Drop]
It's been too long
And I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me free, oh

[Verse]
Girl, we could fly or take a boat
One way or another
I've decided, say the word
We can go discover
Every single place
There isn't one that's too far
If you're a rider, let me know
'Cause I'm down to take you now
Oh, no, no
Tell me can I take you now?

[Chorus]
It's been too long
I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me free, oh
It's been too long
And I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me free

It's been too long
It's been too long

[Drop]
It's been too long

[Post-Drop]
It's been too long
And I know exactly what I need
I gotta treat myself
Go somewhere I know will set me freeEmbed
