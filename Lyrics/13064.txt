Ain’t It Easy Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Come home to me
Re-runs on TV
Now you sit with me I keep you safe
And you listen to me everyday
Season premiere
I have no more fear
No more judges, no more medicine
When I talk to you, I take you in
[Chorus]
Ain’t it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy

(You come back to me)

[Verse 2]
I should havе known
That you had lost control
Working every night until the dawn
Find you sleeping with thе headlights on

[Chorus]
Ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easy
Ain't it easy, ain't it easy, ain't it easyYou might also like1Embed
