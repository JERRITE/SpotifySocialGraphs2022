TranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisNobody Else Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what you see in me
Gotta be something different
You must be made for me, patience is everything
In and out, in and out, in and out
Arguing, trifling
Difficult, maybe more
I don't know, know why you love me, yeah
You caught it bad, you got it bad for me, babe
And I'm so glad that they can't have this, babe
[Chorus]
Nobody else but you
Nobody else could make this move
Nobody else had a clue
What I could do, what I could do
The right amount of love, right amount of trust
Right amount of dick
Right amount of slap me up
I think I'm throwin' a fit
Right amount of roleplay
Right amount of talkin' to me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Feel it in my heart, feel it my soul, feel it in my bod', my body
Play fair, I gotta let you do, no
Will never fall out of love with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fuss
Baby, I'm trusting you, I'm trusting you, ah
Fightin' on my mind, fightin' all my life for you
I'm trusting you, babe
I want this, I want this to work out so bad
God, I feel it in my chest at night
I want this, I want this, yeah, yeah
Will never fall out of love with you
With you, with you, with you, with you

Get you, get you, get you, get you
I, I, I love you, boy
I, I, yeah, yeah8Embed
