Music For the Visually Impaired Lyrics[Verse 1: Eazy Mac]
It's Eazy, I'm back now
Sorry for the wait, I passed out
Woke up in the middle of a crack house
Wiped off my nose on my clothes, then I ran out
Ridiculousness
Had to get up in the kitchen with the flick of the wrist
I got the medicine, nutrition, and the chicken and grits
To paint the picture for these bitches tryna listen to this
Cuz now I'm making music for the visually impaired
They say they can't see me, I'm literally here
Tryna stack a Milli with a rhythm and a snare
Soon as I step in the building the building is in the air
The building be building up
Imagine the feeling of when counting a million bucks
This probably isn't enough to stop me from taking drugs
So we stay high (High, high) on that play ride (Yeah)
2 girls at the same time (*Laughing*)
Took em for a date night
They did great white, then they gave me jaw
So they ate twice, then we went to the NBA game it was drake night
Wanted to give him my Mixtape, anything I don't give a fuck it's Drake
Security stopped me like (Get the fuck outta here)
I mean I guess I am a bit late..
[Verse 2: Eazy Mac]
Take it way back
My momma dropped me off at day camp
Never came back then she blamed Dad
Now I hate dad, don't need him
Only wanna car when I say I wanna BM
Started from the Bottom, wrappin' up a pita
Then I started rapping now I get to rap arenas (Hahaha)
A Milli for a feature (Hahaha)
You can hear the cheering in the bleachers
Blasting out the speakers
I go blocka,blocka,blocka,blocka,blocka with the heaters
Teachers said I wouldn't be shit...... oh.. okay
It's the main attraction, Wavy habits
Taking acid, chasing rabbits, like its Easter
Tryna get to Hollywood to date Rihanna
Whatever I imagine, bitch I can make it happen
Peyton Manning quarterbacking, going past him
Vroom vroom when I pull up in an Aston (Yeah)
And you pulled up in the equinox
Your bitch was on my dick up and down doing Kegel squats
Eat it like a pizza pop
But if she fuck the seats up then she clean up with a Kleenex box  (Yeah)
And Eazy always keep it hot and *laughs*
Fuck this

To become truly immortal, a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken, it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams.. Lets get highEmbed
