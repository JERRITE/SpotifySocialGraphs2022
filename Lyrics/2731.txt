Better By Myself Lyrics[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
There may be something in the water
Over here in California's
Got me feeling like I'm better off alone
Maybe it's the way you used me
Watered down my love, abused me
And you'd always criticize me on the phone
[Refrain]
Ooh, ah

[Verse 2]
Would you kill me if I told you
That I never wanna speak to you
'Cause when I'm on my own, I feel alive
And there's nothing wrong with crying
But my empathy is dying
'Cause we never were that good, we'd always fight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better by myself (Self)
I'm better when there's no you in my life

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
You're no good for my health (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)

[Verse 3]
Everything you do just wears me down
It's getting old, I'm turned around
It feels like you're just wasting me away
When you choose to terrorize me
Any confidence inside me dies
You suffocate me with the things you say
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better by myself (Self)
I'm better when there's no you in my life
You're no good for my health (Health)
You're no good for my troubled state of mind

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
You're no good for my health (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)

[Bridge]
Woo
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
You're no good for my health (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself (Better by myself, better by myself)
I'm better by myself12Embed
