Surprise LyricsBitch you know Bratter’s back with the heat raps
All that pussy ass talk, I don’t need that
Y’all saying I’m one of the best, we agreed that
Bitch you shouldn’t fuck with me, you’ll regret it, guarantee that

Yeah it’s called Notepad but with me it’s a Heatpad
Little did you know I made fire on my Leappad
Y’all pussies think I’m lying well what shit make you believe that
Now I’m out here being on the top, bitch you dream that

Say my name and don’t forget it
Y’all just can’t admit I’m winning
Y’all just can’t admit I’m spitting
Talent given, now I’m fitting
In the game, money getting
I ain’t quitting, I ain’t kidding
Now I’m grinning, now I’ve risen
Bitch you know I’m not forgiving

Y’all bitches better listen
I hear the snakes damn they hissing
Like they got their own religion
Who don’t care bout your opinion

All they do is cause division
With full speed head on collision
But this not what’s my decision
This is Bratter, fire edition

Lemme break it down for you bitches in the front row
Turn into a monster if you wanna be in control
I’m telling you just try it and come back when you’ve done so
May seem crazy but I’m saying that shit fun tho

Maybe y’all ain’t ready for that valuable life lesson
But hey y’all ain’t ready for this tactical aggression
Or this rational obsession with adaptable discretion
That’s a rational impression of my capital essence

Y’all pussies still treat me like a joke
I ain’t laughing
You say I can’t rhyme and I’m trash
Why you capping
You might also likeOr better yet
You pretend you like my work
But as you're saying that
I know you're sitting there with a smirk

What do I gotta do
To fucking prove to y'all this ain't a game
Sure I ain't a rap star
But at least I ain't a no name

Y'all really think you're funny
Fucking lying to my face
Well shit I'm fucking used to it
But you're still a damn disgrace

Aye this surprise you
Let me just remind you
This shit is easier
When you got people beside you

People that will guide you
People that won’t lie to
You when you decide to do something
That won’t be wise to

Do cause it won’t benefit you
Or your future ambitions
They looking out for you
Cause they know that you on a mission
And they understand that when you’re depressed
You can be distant
And they got mad respect for you
Cause they know you’ve never given

Up when it’s tempting
And you’re still here which a blessing
And they know life can be stressing
But fame is where you’re destined

And you’re barely ever resting
But when you do it’s refreshing
And if you ever miss
You’re bound to get redemption

You don’t waste your time anymore
Cause then you’re bound to fail
You gotta care about
Every single detail

You’ll have to fight some battles
But believe that you’ll always prevail
Maybe through the hard times
You’ll find your holy grail

Leave nothing undecided
Change shit when you need to
Go through it more than twice
Success is where it’ll lead to

Stay fucking humble and
Don’t let greed consume you
We all make mistakes
But don’t let people mislead you

Listen to yourself
Trust your gut
And when you need to
Keep your mouth shut

Cause everything you say
Is what can be used against you
Someone might hear one thing
Take it wrong and then torment you

Gotta be smart with it
Don’t ever throw away your gift
Like a ninja move in silence
Then you come at them with a hit

Do it when they least expect it
They doubt you, gotta teach them a lesson
Work your ass off then once your ready
Drive at them with full force, Tokyo Drift

Hell yeah they didn't see that coming
It's like the haters really know how to push your buttons
So when you hit them with that shit they say nothing
Make them sorry for not trusting

In you and your abilities
Who tf cares if depression's a disability?
You still walk around with that creativity
While you take humility and wonder of the possibility

That you can be happy
And that you can be successful
Those two don't hand in hand
Your life will still be stressful

You will still have problems
If you're famous, you'll have even more
You'll have to deal with more hate
And the paparazzi at your door

You barely get some time by yourself
Gotta question who's real and who's around cause you got wealth
Everyone will care about the music and not about your health
They calling you weak when you cry for help

Nah you ain't weak
You just gotta make them see
There's so much more than
What goes on behind the scene

You come out of nowhere
The real ones aren't surprised
You will never stop
Until you're fully satisfied

That's what I fucking plan to do
Blow up like a fucking nuke
Now when people say your name
They no longer asking "Who?"

"Oh yeah I know him I like his shit
He's underrated by a lot tho"
Ain't gotta tell me, yeah I know
They can't see I'm rapping like a proEmbed
