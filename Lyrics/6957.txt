Best Thing Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, let's see

[Verse 1]
I thought I found love
But you ain't shit, no
Gave you a space in my heart
But you ain't fit, no, no
And it hurts, but I let it
I let it 'cause I, I needed that pain
But I wanted to feel it
'Cause it'll teach me not to go back there again
[Chorus]
And I put my heart on it
Don't try to stop me when I leave
I put my all on it
Look what you did to me
I couldn't count on ya
'Cause you was fuckin' with everyone but me
So I walked out on ya
And it was the best thing I did for me
(Best thing, best thing, best thing)
I did for me
(Best thing, best thing, best thing)
I did for me

[Verse 2]
Now I really be like fuck that nigga, my attitude changed
Take a couple sips of the D'USSÉ
Ain't no ring on my finger anyway
I miss the dick, but that'll go away
I just gotta stop thinking 'bout you (Thinking 'bout you)
Fill my time with better shit to do (Better shit to do)
I dreamed that I married you
Then I woke up happy it never came true
You (You), you're not the one
I gotta find a way to be done, yeah
And I think I found that shit
Don't wanna be in love again
Too easy for you to go astray
Nigga, my son don't like you anyway
Good thing that I walked away
Now you ain't gotta hear me say
You might also like[Chorus]
That I put my heart on it
Don't try to stop me when I leave
I put my all on it
And look what you did to me
I couldn't count on ya
'Cause you was fuckin' with everyone but me
So I walked out on ya
And it was the best thing I did for me
(Best thing, best thing, best thing)
I did for me (I did, I did, yeah)
(Best thing, best thing, best thing)
I did for me (For me, for me, for me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I thought I found love
But you ain't shit, oh4Embed
