Itâ€™s a Trip! Lyrics[Verse 1]
Creepy little sneaky little foreign places
Terrifying territories, I can't take it
It's a great big atlas, yeah
I'm feeling dumb

[Chorus]
When you've gotten what you want
Maybe I should start over
There's nothing left to want
Up and at 'em again
You don't know what you want
Yeah, I'm thinking it over
Just tell me what to want
[Verse 2]
Floating little second hands laugh like jokers
Keepin' me from thinking straight
I've lost composure

[Chorus]
When you've gotten what you want
Maybe I should start over
There's nothing left to want
Up and at 'em again
You don't know what you want
Yeah, I'm thinking it over
Just tell me what I...

[Chorus]
When you've gotten what you want
Maybe I should start over
There's nothing left to want
Up and at 'em again
You don't know what you want
Yeah, I'm thinking it over
Just tell me what to want

[Interlude]
This is a trip
This is a trip
You might also like[Chorus]
When you've gotten what you want
There's nothing left to want
You don't know what you want
Yeah, I'm thinking it over
Just tell me what I...

[Outro]
When you've gotten what you want
Maybe I should start over
There's nothing left to want
Up and at 'em again
You don't know what you want
Yeah, I'm thinking it over
Just tell me what to want3Embed
