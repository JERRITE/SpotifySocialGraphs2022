Came through just to pick you up (Uh)
Took the night off just for us (Yeah, yeah)
With everything that you do for me
Girl, you know I'm 'bout to make your day
'Cause my heart skips whenever I can see you
And I know them girls look at you, they wanna be you, uh

Take you to the crib, things are 'bout to heat up
Heat up, heat up, babe

Girl, every time I lay down, you be in my dreams
You takin' me to places that I've never seen
And you ain't gotta worry, girl, I'll take it slow
Lay you down and show you everything I know
I don't want you feelin' like you need to go
I want you to stay however long you want
I'll never understand how he ain't know what he had
Baby girl, you all in your bag
All in your bag (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
