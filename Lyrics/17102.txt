Right Back Out LyricsLets go

No time to waste, I gotta turn up now
I done turnt up it ain't no turning me down
Came a long way from broke ain't no turning around
Shit get's deep in these st(k)reets, don't drown
Hit that bitch from the front and I'm turning her around
Had to count it again I done lost my count
I'm just chasin' the money, they chasin' the clout
I was just locked up and I'm right back out
My feet touched the ground and I took right off
Let me turn this shit up one time
Do this shit for the bros doin' time
Kept that shit silent, I ain't dropped no dimes
I put dick in that hoe one time
I'm all in her throat, made her choke one time
Back to the money, I'm back on my grind
I can lose all this shit, but won't lose my mind


I do this shit without tryin'
Been gettin' to the money since 9
I got them checkin' my bitch, so fine
I'mma keep it 100 I ain't tellin' no lies
I had to stay down, but this shit take time
They say that I've changed, I've left them behind
Can't speak on the pain I be having inside
When they speak on my name bet they tell you I'm solid

*talkin his shit*

Yeah, go get the cash, racks!
When you take a loss, then go get that shit back
Every boss in this shit took a loss, that's a fact
They gon' pray you fall off, they gon' hate, that's a fact
Fuck 'em! Go get the money and stack it
Make that shit flip like you jump on the mattress
Iceberg, bitch I got BOSSMAN status
I would just sleep on a Patek
You might also like
Ain't no time to waste, I gotta turn up now
I done turnt up it ain't no turning me down
Came a long way from broke ain't no turning around
Shit get's deep in these st(k)reets, don't drown
Hit that bitch from the front and I'm turning her around
Had to count it again I done lost my count
I'm just chasin' the money, they chasin' the clout
I was just locked up and I'm right back out
My feet touched the ground and I took right off

Let me turn this shit up one time
Do this shit for the bros doin' time
Kept that shit silent, I ain't dropped no dimes
I put dick in that hoe one time
I'm all in her throat, made her choke one time
Back to the money, I'm back on my grind
I can lose all this shit, but won't lose my mind


Iceberg, where you been?
I been stackin' it up for my family and kids
I do this shit with no pad or no pen
I been dubbed off(?), but that money still comin' in
Won't speak on this shit that I've seen, no I didn't
They know when I do it, the kid do it big
Had love for some people, they burnt that bridge
My heart so cold, I won't love again
You niggas I'm never gon' trust
Got a house full of hoes like I'm Usher
My momma she raised me a hustler
Face card good, I be workin' my muscle
When I drop many niggas in trouble
Touched down and got straight to the money
I can't talk if it ain't bout no money
I been focused on shit that's in front of me

Count this shit up, I'm in love this sound
Nigga's ain't what I'm on, so I keep'em from 'round me
Pray they free all my dawgs out the county
If there's mud on that money I'm still gon' count it

Stackin' my paper and I'm stayin' out the wayy
My time is money, and I can't play


No time to waste, I gotta turn up now
I done turnt up it ain't no turning me down
Came a long way from broke ain't no turning around
Shit get's deep in these st(k)reets, don't drown
Hit that bitch from the front and I'm turning her around
Had to count it again I done lost my count
I'm just chasin' the money, they chasin' the clout
I was just locked up and I'm right back out
My feet touched the ground and I took right off

Let me turn this shit up one time
Do this shit for the bros doin' time
Kept that shit silent, I ain't dropped no dimes
I put dick in that hoe one time
I'm all in her throat, made her choke one time
Back to the money, I'm back on my grind
I can lose all this shit, but won't lose my mindEmbed
