Oh Honey! (I Love You) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Will you remember my name?
I've gone away but I'll be back again

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you call me up to tell me that I need you
I'll run through for you

[Chorus]
Oh, honey
I love you
Only you
Oh, honey
I love you
[Verse 2]
All my days I been reaching higher
Flying through the skies when the world's on fire
Baby, what you want? Tell me your desires
Ooh, you
There's something 'bout that smile that gives me superpowers
Runnin' through my head you leave me stuck for hours
Jumpin' off the edge just to smell those flowеrs
And no, I couldn't wait another day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you call me up to tell mе that I need you
I'll run through for you

[Chorus]
Oh, honey
I love you
Only you
Oh, honey
I love youYou might also like3Embed
