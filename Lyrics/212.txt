TranslationsРусскийHeart & Soul Lyrics[Intro]
Went to jail, came home
Jason (Haha)
Man, say, I-I feel good, nigga, I don't—
And it's— you know, my first time bein' on the mic, nigga
Went to jail, came home
Who am I? Like, aha, who was I?
You know, I guess words don't even matter
You know we movin' forward
Went to jail, came home, time passed, went back again
All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end
I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends
I was criticizin' myself like, you ain't never gon' win
[Chorus]
Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids
I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it"
I'm like, "DeSean, thuggin', you just hustlin' backwards
Nigga, you done won
I just fail to accept that you not good for anyone"
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
I can feel it in my soul

[Verse 1]
They say that he ain't gon' be here long
I see myself on top the mountain
I'm smokin' strong, I'm keepin' strong
No more ridin' with that window down
Hangin' out, tryna lay them down
My soul, I still ain't think I found
When I tell bro on the phone
I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now
So my girl don't want her a bust down
I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now
I been wanna do right since I touched down
I been watchin' the way I influence now
I ain't post not a picture, I moved on
I'm responsible to all these children now
Even though they label me teflon
Back into my normal home
Back inside my closet, puttin' that VLONE on
Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone
First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone"
With all these thoughts on top my dome

Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids
I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it"
I'm like, "DeSean, thuggin', you just hustlin' backwards
Nigga, you done won
I just fail to accept that you not good for anyone"
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
I can feel it in my soul

[Verse 2]
I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me
They gon' kill me if they can
No need for dissin', come get rid of me
I'm grown now, I'm a man
So tell 'em, "Ain't no time for sympathy"
I been holdin' all these bands
Don't give a fuck 'bout who not feelin' me
Or into me, intimate, not no consistency
She ain't into me, yeah
Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me
It ain't get to me, nah, every time you said that you ain't shit to me
Even though you meant the world to me
Goin' straight even though you curvin' me
I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy
Heart on top my shoulder now
I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets
Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now
Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now
Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now
Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now
Lil Top on top of the map right now
Been dead but nigga, I'm back right now
Keepin' this shit on track right now
I don't take no Adderall
Pure washing make my feelings dissolve
Phone ring, I decline that call
When it's trouble, I get back with y'all
My hair hang on top my eyes, it fall
Through the rain, I'm seein' through all this fog
[Chorus]
Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids
I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it"
I'm like, "DeSean, thuggin', you just hustlin' backwards
Nigga, you done won
I just fail to accept that you not good for anyone"
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
I can feel it in my soul11Embed
