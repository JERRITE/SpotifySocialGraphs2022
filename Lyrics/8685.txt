Honeymoon With B Troop Lyrics[Verse 1: Graham Gouldman]
My baby, she's crazy, she's lazy
So she's always bummin' around (Round, round, round)
Girls in France don't stand a chance
'Cause I've always got my baby around (Round, round, round)

[Chorus: Graham Gouldman]
So, don't touch her (Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum)
Oh, it's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine

[Verse 2: Graham Gouldman]
At night we sleep tight we
Stay close together 'cause the temperature's down
(Down, down, down)
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around (Round, round, round)
[Chorus: Graham Gouldman]
Please don't touch her
(Bum bum bum bum)

[Post-Chorus: Graham Gouldman]
Sittin' with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto, be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride
Da da da da da da da

[Verse 3: Graham Gouldman]
My baby goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day (Day, day, day)
She's bathing al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display (Splay, splay, splay)

[Chorus: Graham Gouldman]
So, don't get too close
Oh she's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine

[Bridge: Eric Stewart]
Ooh it's a drag when you're hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang think she's part of the scenery
You're never alone and the tension is painful to see

[Verse 4: Graham Gouldman]
One night I crept in and
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife (Wife, wife, wife)
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life (Life, life, life)
