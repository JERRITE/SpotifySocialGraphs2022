The Perfect Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Wake me up, I’ve been dreaming
It feels just like any other day-
I sit you down, here goes nothing
And you’re not gonna like what I say
Get out, oh just get out

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now
[Verse 2:]
Wake me up, I’ve been dreaming
Because I haven’t heard from you in days
Hazy now, this fog just follows me around
And it’s only you that burns it away
So get out, oh just get out

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now

[Bridge:]
I see your face, every time I close my eyes
Its getting worse you say, it comes as no surprise

Why am I hell bent on losing, when I can’t get you out of my head?

[Chorus:]
“Get Up, Get Out”
That’s what she said, “You drive me crazy.”
“I can’t believe that’s what you did.”
“And don’t call me baby.”
And I know I’m wrong, I knew all along that you’d find out
I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now
You might also like[Outro]
Oh I’m the perfect mistake, I’m hoping you’ll make right now-
Oh you’ll make right nowEmbed
