Drowning (Sped Up Version) Lyrics[intro]
I’m drownin’ I’m drownin’
I’m drownin’ I’m drownin’

[Chorus]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I’m drownin’
In water, I just bought a Cuban ring, dipped it in the fountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’ I just bought a Cuban ring
Dipped it in the fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I’m holdin’ up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’
[verse 1]
I’m with all my niggas, I don’t go nowhere without ‘em
If they don’t let us they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor’s
I’m with RJ but I call him Wayne ‘cause he’s a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridgе
Im gon’ make her panties wеt when she see the way that I flex
I’m gon’ win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin’ in the projects to makin’ projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don’t need no fucking voucher
She look at my wrist and she look at a hundred thousand

[Chorus]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I’m drownin’
In water, I just bought a Cuban ring, dipped it in the fountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’ I just bought a Cuban ring
Dipped it in the fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I’m holdin’ up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’

Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude, but I ain’t from compton
Lil Kodak bitch I’m Polo’d down like Carlton
Sniper gang I out a nigga on a carton
I’m the shit I’m fartin’, I don’t know how to potty
Pull up in a ‘Rari, I’m in the Yo like Gotti
A boogie, I’m goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain’t Jamaican, bitch I’m Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson everyday, I’m ridin’ with the chopper
They hatin’, I know they don’t wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain’t do trims, I’m in the cut like I’m a barber
She called me daddy, but I ain’t her motherfucking father

[Chorus]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I’m drownin’
In water, I just bought a Cuban ring, dipped it in the fountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’ I just bought a Cuban ring
Dipped it in the fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I’m holdin’ up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it’s a light show, I’m surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down
Bitch I’m drownin’
I’m drownin’
I’m drownin’
I’m drownin’
I’m drownin’Embed
