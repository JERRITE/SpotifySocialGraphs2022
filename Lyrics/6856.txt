Not Your Type LyricsI was not your type, but I could get pushed into that
I could make this believable, like my natural habitat
It only takes a few words to stick in your head:
"Boys don't like girls who wear stuff like that."
Nothing ever fits like it's supposed to
Constant reminders, what the world didn't give to you

Wallow in the person I never wanted to be
Then femininity lost power over me
I was not your type
Is it envy or lust? I dunno. But some days drive it home
That I'm not enough, when so many others fit the mold
Is it who you'd like to be? Or the way she makes you feel?
Should've seen the rings around my eyes, yeah I did that shit for years

Wallow in the person I never wanted to be
Then femininity lost power over me
I was not your type

Wallow in the person I never wanted to be
Then femininity lost power over me
