Who We Are LyricsWe are ears when nobody listens
We are that ingredient that makes it addictive
We are the long words when everything is abbreviated
We are the joy, and enjoyable
We are the tunnels to other worlds
We are the seeds that no one thought would grow
This is who we are !

We create our own patterns, do you see them ?

We are visible for those who feel
A faith unfolds in minor cold
We have traveled this road on our own
Sing to fight in the sound, all we've known
This music's who we are
And no matter near or far
We have been here from the start
It's who we are

This is who we are ! (uh)

This music's who we are
And no matter near or far
Yeah !

We are the tunnels to other worlds
We are the seeds that no one thought would grow
This is who we are !You might also likeEmbed
