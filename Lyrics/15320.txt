Collie Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
And some man live his life for profits alone
That very same man he lives his life all alone
And in the road to life yes it goes up and down
Doesn't really matter, as long as the music goes on

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. collie man, why don't you come 'round, no more?
Hey, Mr. collie man, don't you hear me troubled call?
Hey, Mr. collie man, hope you didn't come to disturb
You best not be come 'round here, unless you've got me sensi herb
[Verse 2]
I never needed any reason for me to say
Through all those troubled times, yes, me love you, anyway
And the roughest path, you know the rocky, rocky road
You know that life and love is a heavy, heavy load

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. collie man, why don't you come 'round, no more?
Hey, Mr. collie man, don't you hear me troubled call?
Hey, Mr. collie man, hope you didn't come to disturb
You best not be come 'round here, unless you've got me sensi herb
You best not be come 'round here, unless you've got me sensi herbYou might also like13Embed
