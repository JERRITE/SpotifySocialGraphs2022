Cuttin Up Lyrics[Intro]
290 shit man, out west shit nigga
You know how we rockin' nigga
Get your guns up, get your funds up
You on that opp shit, get mop stick bitch
Straight gang shit, ay, Boochie Gang

[Hook]
She said she like my swag, I be cuttin' up
He can't hang with us cause he ain't cut enough
You don't want war with us, you ain't tough enough
I just bought a fifth of Henny and I drunk it up
You say you want some smoke, nigga puff it up
We fall in KOD and then we fuck it up
We criminals, this shit can get corrupt with us
You do subliminals, we ride with them illegals tucked
[Verse 1]
I told these pussy niggas not to fuck with us
And shout out to the hoes that be suckin' us
I gotta get this money up, that's a must
Used to ride the bus, see the cops then I'm kickin' dust
I cop a foreign, I'ma valet park the bitch
I'm rolling with my niggas, I can't fuck with the opposite
She said she wanna fuck, I'ma charge the bitch
Ten thou' for thirty minutes, give her the hardest dick
I know you see me, VIP with all this bling on
I punch your ass in your face with all my rings on
Hollow bullets beatin' on your chest, chopper King Kong
I get that work, I bounce it back like a ping pong
You Bill Withers, get you a shoulder that you can lean on
Just met a thick bitch, her name was money and she wear green thongs
I heard you be lackin' off that lean, get your snooze on
Get my cruise on, I'm a mack with some Trues on

[Hook]
She said she like my swag, I be cuttin' up
He can't hang with us cause he ain't cut enough
You don't want war with us, you ain't tough enough
I just bought a fifth of Henny and I drunk it up
You say you want some smoke, nigga puff it up
We fall in KOD and then we fuck it up
We criminals, this shit can get corrupt with us
You do subliminals, we ride with them illegals tucked

I'm higher than the stars, coolin' with this thot
I can tell she ain't never been in a foreign car
She can tell I get money, I buy the whole bar
Last night I could've sworn I smoked the whole jar
F&N, chopper bullets, they go very far
I fuck that bitch and her friend like Hugh Hefner
And bitch I live the life of a hard knock
Have a shootout with the feds, I might kill a cop
Put this red beam on your head like a polka dot
And if a nigga fuck with my bread, watch a body drop
Niggas in the house cause they scared, we pop out a lot
We pull up with Glocks, MACs, 90's, got Rugers with mops
And I don't give a fuck 'bout no bitch, I got all the thots
It ain't no lackin', keep a thirty in that clip, I got all the shots
I call all the shots, I got coke in all of the pots
I pull up in a drop, throwin' hundreds all out the top

[Hook]
She said she like my swag, I be cuttin' up
He can't hang with us cause he ain't cut enough
You don't want war with us, you ain't tough enough
I just bought a fifth of Henny and I drunk it up
You say you want some smoke, nigga puff it up
We fall in KOD and then we fuck it up
We criminals, this shit can get corrupt with us
You do subliminals, we ride with them illegals tucked1Embed
