Cry for Help Lyrics"Hey, wanna fuck?" (God)
Did I just say that? Oh my God
I feel stupid, am I a slut?
I think I need to stop drinking
Wait, no, walk away
Don't want to drown you in my mistakes
Oh, I'm a felon, you're a saint
Don't stand too close to my demons

Why am I always stuck up on my fucking problems?
So busy tryna numb the pain
Why am I always faded like I'm still in college?
Consider this my cry for help
I can't seem to get my shit together
And I promise everyday
I try but this shit just takes forever
And when I finally meet a guy
I try and I try to believe him
When I finally do I get scared and I leave him
I'm giving up
I can't seem to get my shit together
Consider this my cry for help

Oops, did it again
I got no key, just let me in
I need yoga, I need a cleanse
Feels like I've never done screaming

Why am I always stuck up on my fucking problems?
So busy tryna numb the pain
Why am I always faded like I'm still in college?

Consider this my cry for help
I can't seem to get my shit together
And I promise everyday
I try but this shit just takes forever
And when I finally meet a guy
I try and I try to believe him
When I finally do I get scared and I leave him
I'm giving up
I can't seem to get my shit together
Consider this my cry for help

Why am I always stuck up on my fucking problems?
So busy tryna numb the pain
Why am I always faded like I'm still in college?

Consider this my cry for help
I can't seem to get my shit together
And I promise everyday
I try but this shit just takes forever
And when I finally meet a guy
I try and I try to believe him
When I finally do I get scared and I leave him
I'm giving up
I can't seem to get my shit together
Consider this my cry for help2Embed
