Invisible Lyrics[Intro: Michael]
Woah, what's that?

[Verse 1: Calum]
Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away, lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

[Chorus: Calum & Luke, Calum]
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
[Verse 2: Calum & Luke, Calum]
Wasted days dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Lookin' on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away

[Chorus: Calum & Luke, Calum]
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Calum & Luke, Calum]
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

[Outro: Calum]
Another day, the walls are built to keep me safe
I can't escape, it's too lateYou might also like25Embed
