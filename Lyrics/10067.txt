Take It To The Floor Lyrics[Hook]
So take it to the floor for a player
Bounce that ass to the ground, girl
Pick up the names that you dropped while you're there
I don't know them niggas
You're steady tryna stunt somethin'
You think a nigga tryna front somethin'
Thinkin' how the water look bluer over there (2x)

[Verse 1]
And we official, never gotta ask me twice
Sippin' Ace from a bucket of Alaska ice
Anyway, it's all Gucci, broads be all bougie
Till them ones come on the plate and they excuse me
Oh I knew that was him but I wasn't real sure
What's all of them bills for? They all on his heels for
So tell him he can come if he can find me
It's probly where the line be, I hope that he can mind read
You want a nigga all up in your thoughts
While I'm thinkin' how much could it cost
But a bag or YSL with big tags
I'm talkin' 'bout the niggas that took it to 5th ave
Used to switch ass like socks and drawers
I gotta switch phone numbers just to stop the calls
They be name droppin, I like seein somethin else droppin
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo she sluggin' and she thumpin'
And she's tryna get another nigga payin' for a couple of things
And if she had it how she wanted, she would get it when she need it
And get somebody to give her a ring
But if wishes had feet, everybody would be a beast
And not have to work for nothing you'd gain
That's fuckin' insane, nigga
You ever wonder what it feel like?
To wake up and do whatever that you feel like?
Ridin' 'round sober in the 918
Half naked dimes dancin' tryna find they dream
Molly capsules, got 'em gettin' open, no hassles
Art school niggas too cool for the tassel
We ain't graduate, let me elaborate
My Mondays cooler than your Saturdays
Go that-a-way
Take that ass to the floor, girl
