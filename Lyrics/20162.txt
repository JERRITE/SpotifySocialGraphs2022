LATELY Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus]
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit gets crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I’m tryna change, but it's very hard

[Verse 1]
Life's been getting to me, I just started smoking squares (I’m stressed)
But they ain't getting in my circle though, we still prepared (For real)
I'm still dealing with some demons that ain't really there
Grew up a screw-up, pierced my ear and dyed my fucking hair (Like that)
In 7th grade, I didn't have a bed, I had to share (For real)
The fuck you think I go so hard for? I got out of there (I'm gone)
Have you ever had somebody try to take your life? (Huh?)
Sometimes, I ain't safe from myself when I stay up at night
[Chorus]
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I’m tryna change, but it’s very hard
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I’m tryna change, but it's very hard

[Verse 2]
Look, I promised myself I ain't never going home (Not at all)
9 years old, my momma left me in the cold (Goddamn)
Ay, what do you think that type of shit do to your soul?
Find someone that finally love me, still I treat her like a hoe (That shit is fucked up)
Damn, it be the shit that they don't know (That they don’t know)
I only smile in public just for show
I know they tried to warn me 'bout my dose
You know them kids be with the Ye and now them kids be seeing ghosts

[Chorus]
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I'm tryna change, but it's very hard
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I'm tryna change, but it's very hard

Uh, yeah, ayy, them demons ain't the only ones that's up at night
Huh, yeah, ayy (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Uh, ayy, uh, ayy, them demons ain't the only ones that's up at night
Oh, does that appear the mark of a human being (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Or a demon's, god save us
Demons ain't the only ones that's up at night

[Chorus]
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I'm tryna change, but it's very hard
Uh, lately, I been having crazy thoughts (Yeah)
The way I'm living, shit get crazy dark (Uh)
Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I'm tryna change, but it's very hard24Embed
