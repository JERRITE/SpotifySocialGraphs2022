Endlessly Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a part of me you'll never know
The only thing I'll never show

[Chorus 1]
Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes
[Verse 2]
It's plain to see it's trying to speak
Cherished dreams forever asleep

[Chorus 1]
Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
But the moment never comesYou might also like5Embed
