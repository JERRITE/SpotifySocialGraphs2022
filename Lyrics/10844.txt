Shallows Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let the water rise
Let the ground crack
Let me fall inside
Lying on my back
Lying on my back

[Verse 2]
Dry your smoke-stung eyes
So you can see the light
You're staring at the sky
Watching stars collide
Watching stars
[Chorus]
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows

[Verse 3]
When the time comes
On the last day
When they start to count down
Will you just
Will you run away?
Will you run away?

[Verse 4]
And let it all rain down
From the blood-stained clouds
Oh come out, come out, to the sea my love
And just
Just drown with me
Just drown with me
You might also like[Chorus]
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
If you leave
When I go
Please don't find me
In the shallows
In the shallows

[Outro]
Lying on my back
Lying on my back
Lying on my back
I'll be
Watching stars
Watching stars
Watching stars collide
Watching stars collide8Embed
