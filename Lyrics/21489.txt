Never Gone Lyrics[Refrain]
High in liquid light
Changing worlds, starting anew
I've been with the sky
But, baby, I'll never leave you
I'm never really gone, never really gone

[Bridge]
Dancing in the dew drops
Chasing the winds
We're crashing in waves of gold
I'll just be gone, I'll just be gone
Rippling in the wings of butterfly effect
A million lives unfold
But you and I are not done
'Cause you and I are one
And I'm never really-
[Drop]
I'm never really gone
I'm never really gone

[Refrain]
High in liquid light
Changing worlds, starting anew
I've been with the sky
But, baby, I'll never leave you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never really gone
Never really gone
Never really gone
Never really gone

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
I'm never really gone
(High in, high in)
(High in, high in)
I'm never really gone

[Outro]
High in liquid light
Changing worlds, starting anewYou might also like1Embed
