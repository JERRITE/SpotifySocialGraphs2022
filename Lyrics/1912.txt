Rain (from the suicide squad) LyricsI do not mind the rain sometimes

'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom

In my mind, when I cry, when I cry

That's the only way the roses bloom

It's okay, I'm not okay

I feel the disarray of yesterday, oh my
I need to feel the raindrops on my head, on my head

I know I know nothing so

Embrace what I cannot control, oh my

Trouble walks beside me 'til my end, 'til my end

I do not mind the rain sometimes (the rain)

'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom

In my mind, when I cry, when I cry

'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom

It's better to have loved and lost, but

The feeling, it comes at the cost (oh my)

My poor heart is my only friend, only friend

I've come to love a heavy sky (a heavy sky)

The lightning couldn't beat my shine (oh my)

I do not mind the rain sometimes

'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom

In my mind, when I cry, when I cry

'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom

Hand on my heart

I swear, I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)

Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)

Now I dance with the pain

Hand on my heart

I swear, I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)

Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)

Now I slow dance with the pain
('Cause that's when roses bloom)

Roses

Roses

Roses (the rain)

Roses bloom

I do not mind the rain sometimes

'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom

In my mind, when I cry, when I cry

'Cause that's the only way

That's the only way the roses bloomEmbed
