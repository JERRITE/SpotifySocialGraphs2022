TranslationsEspañol​forget her. Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I spend all my days
Trying to forget her face
She's so hard to erase
I don't think she can be replaced

[Chorus]
She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
(I don't understand)
She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
(I don't understand)
[Verse 2]
I spend all my days
Thinking of her embrace
The way it slowly changed
Some things will never fade

[Chorus]
She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
(I don't understand)
She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
(I don't understand)You might also like7Embed
