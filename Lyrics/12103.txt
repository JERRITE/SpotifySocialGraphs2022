No Giving Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
So, you found out today, your life's not the same
Not quite as perfect as it was yesterday
When you were just getting in the groove
Now you're faced with something new
And I know it hurts and I know you feel torn
But you never gave up this easily before
So why do you choose today
To give it all away?
Well, it's not so bad y'all, together we all fall
Just as long as we get up, we'll stand tall
We shouldn't waste another day
Thinking 'bout the things that we forgot to say
I'm hittin' back y'all, kickin' these four walls
Just as hard as I can, 'til I can't crawl
I won't waste another day
With all these silly things swimmin' in my brain
[Chorus]
There's no givin' up now!
Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way, somedays?
No givin' up now!
Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Over and over again, all over again

[Verse 2]
So, your scars fade away, you soaked up the pain
A better person 'cause you lived through those days
And now you know what it's like to prove
You can overcome anything that gets to you
Well, it's alright, we're sayin' our goodbyes
To the past and everything that ain't right
We won't waste another day
With all these silly things in our way

[Chorus]
There's no givin' up now!
Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way, somedays?
No givin' up now!
Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Before you give it up now
You might also like[Bridge]
I know we have given
All that we can give
When there's nothing to lean on
Well, I'd remember this
All we make of this lifetime
Is always here within
And remembering that's why
We should never give in

[Chorus/Outro]
Do you really wanna give this all away?
Can't you ever see things in a different way, someday?
Such a beautiful thing to throw away
You should think things through
Over and over again, all over again
There's no givin' up now!Embed
