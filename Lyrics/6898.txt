Soft Skin LyricsSoft skin
Cold as ice
Telephone
Waiting on the line
Ah, the girls sing
What do you want to eat today (Ahh)
I don't know just fix me something from the fridge
What do you want to do today (Ayy)
Drive around the city til we're lost again
Who do you want to see today (Ayy)
Drop it on the pavement til it's hot like skin
Skin, Skin
Hot like skin
Hot like skin
What's That Line?
Every story has an ending
Only you were there from the beginning
Every story has an ending
Only you were there from the beginning
Every story has an ending
Only you were there from the beginning
Every story has an ending
Only you were there
Soft skin
Cold as ice
Telephone
Waiting on the line
Ah, Ah, AhYou might also likeEmbed
