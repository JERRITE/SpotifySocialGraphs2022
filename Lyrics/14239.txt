Play the Part LyricsSay i broke your heart but it was broke to start
Only fuck i gave it turned into some art
Take me for a fool and imma play the part
Take me for a fool and imma play the part

Looking for the light and all i found was dark
I don't sleep at night so i don't need alarms
Leave her in the ocean gotta feed the sharks
I ain't savin hoes cuz this ain't noah's ark
And i can't change the past i'm sorry for you scars
This ain't disney park this ain't disney park
I know sometimes it's hard to find out who to trust
Gotta keep your guard up keep your guard up
Say i broke your heart but it was broke to start
Only fuck i gave it turned into some art
Take me for a fool and imma play the part
Take me for a fool and imma play the part

Till we fall apart
I'm so i'm so heartless
I'm so heartless
Nowadays i don't drink for fun
Nowadays i don't drink for fun
I just talked to god told me i'm the one
I just talked to god told me patience son

Say i broke your heart but it was broke to start
Only fuck i gave it turned into some art
Take me for a fool and imma play the part
Take me for a fool and imma play the partYou might also like1Embed
