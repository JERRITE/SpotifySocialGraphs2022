Good Olâ€™ Fashion Nightmare Lyrics[Verse 1]
Show me the side-streets in your life
Train yards like boneyards, sharpened knives
Sidewalks are unassuming fields
Concrete and cracks won't cut you deals
Won't cut you deals, won't cut you

[Verse 2]
Lost teeth like white jewels of some kind
Petty theft for penny crimes
For penny crimes and we yell
[Chorus]
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
Ahhh
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
Ahhh

[Verse 3]
Riding trains to end of lines
Still we've got nothin' but time
The skyline looks brighter tonight
Let's go smash out every light
Your left foot in front of right
In front of right and we yell

[Chorus]
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
Ahhh
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
Ahhh
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
Ahhh
Ahhh, like a good old fashion nightmare
AhhhYou might also like3Embed
