Feelings 4 You Lyrics[Verse 1]
First of all
I don't mean no disrespect
So you can check me if I’m wrong
In the past you told me no
But nowadays a yes is strong (Ee)
I can't figure it out
I just know that I think about you more
Than anyone I've met before
So hear me out
I know we’re friends
If that's all you want, that's all I'll give
But I can't walk around like you
Don't got my head in the ceiling (Ooh, oh, oh-oh)
Guess I'm revealing
[Chorus]
I still got feelings for you, feelings for you
I still got feelings for you
Head in the ceiling
Guess I'm revealing
I still got feelings for

[Verse 2]
Second of all
I feel like you threw some hints
At me back when I was involved (Back when I was involved)
Telling me what I deserve
And picking up every call
Like, you don’t wanna miss this (You don’t wanna miss)
I know we're in a crazy position
’Cause we both know something is missing
So hear me out (Hear me out)
I know we're fresh (I know we're fresh)
But who gone fill my shoes
When it comes to loving you?
'Cause I can’t walk around like I don't got my head in the ceiling
Guess I'm revealing

[Chorus]
That I still got feelings for (You)
And I try to deny my (Feelings for you)
But baby I still got feelings for you
You got my (You got my) head in the ceiling (You got my)
Guess I'm revealing (I can't fight it no more)
I still got feelings for you
You might also like[Outro]
(Feelings I kept inside, I kept inside, oh, no)
If you want me, baby won't you say yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah (Woo)
Yeah-yeah, all you gotta do is say (Yeah-yeah)
All you gotta do is (Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
Say you want me to girl (Yeah, yeah)
I'll say yeah (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I've got (Feelings for you)Embed
