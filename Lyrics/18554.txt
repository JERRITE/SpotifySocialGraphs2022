FTS Lyrics[Verse 1: Brain Dales]
It's five in the morning
Pour a smile in my cup
In a world full of hate
I ain't got nothing but love
I'm just tryin' to be happy
I don't need to pretend
'Cause all the things that you live for
Make me wish I was dead

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Dales]
I don't need your expectation or your fancy house
Seems like the world is going crazy, tryna bring me down
[Chorus: Brian Dales & Travie McCoy]
But I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Don't try and tread on me
'Cause I ain't having it
Yeah, I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Yeah, I just wanna be free
Shut up and let me live (It's Travie)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
First off, you can shut your motherfucking mouth
And let me tell you what my lifе's been all about
2020 had me balled up in a fetal
But thank God I ain't fall back to that needlе
A lot of people made excuses and used Covid
But I just took it and used it to make my magnum opus
Haha, and I never slept better
As above, below, we stay tethered

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Dales]
I don't need another zero in my bank account
Seems like the world is going crazy, tryna bring me down

[Chorus: Brian Dales]
But I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Don't try and tread on me
'Cause I ain't having it (I ain't having it)
Yeah, I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Yeah, I just wanna be free
Shut up and let me live

[Bridge: Brian Dales]
But I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Don't try and tread on me
'Cause I ain't having it

[Chorus: Brian Dales, Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I say hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Don't try and tread on me
'Cause I ain't having it (I ain't never slept better)
Yeah, I ay hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck that shit
Yeah, I just wanna be free
Shut up and let me liveEmbed
