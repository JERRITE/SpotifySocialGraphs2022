Bronx Baby Lyrics[Intro]
22, what up?

[Chorus]
Walk in the spot it's just me and my bitch and my chop
Move hot, get shot
He gon' die on the spot
Go get 'em, get rid of him
Bullets too fast can't dodge, they hitting em
I don't got time for these hoes
They be acting like babies, I ain't babysitting em
I told Lisa to pass me my nina
Diamonds water, my neck Aquafina
Fuck that bitch, I don't need that bitch
She thought I was dumb, I ain't seeding shit
She want me to shoot up the club
I hit it one night
To pull up, she a dub
I know why they mad, I know why they hate
'Cause Smooky MarGielaa he do what he want
New Lambo truck with the trunk in the front
Opps talk hot and I still ain't get touched
[Verse 1]
I told to take it one step at a time
She moving too fast it's like she tryna line me
I told her turn around, hit from behind
They know I don't play, MarGielaa a bandhi
She get kicked out the spot
Moving too wok now you sleep in the lobby
Land in Atlanta, throw money at Follies
There go my brody in jail for a body
Tell lil' bro, go clap for me
Keep the thing tucked 'cause I hear they after me
Cops can't catch me, I run like a athlete
Play me? He could get left on a backstreet
I got gang with me and I'm never alone
I got thang with me and I know the niggas who gon' bang for me
Shit get real ugly, it don't get pretty

[Chorus]
Walk in the spot it's just me and my bitch and my chop
Move hot, get shot
He gon' die on the spot
Go get 'em, get rid of him
Bullets too fast can't dodge, they hitting em
I don't got time for these hoes
They be acting like babies, I ain't babysitting em
I told Lisa to pass me my nina
Diamonds water, my neck Aquafina
Fuck that bitch, I don't need that bitch
She thought I was dumb, I ain't seeding shit
She want me to shoot up the club
I hit it one night
To pull up, she a dub
I know why they mad, I know why they hate
'Cause Smooky MarGielaa he do what he want
New Lambo truck with the trunk in the front
Opps talk hot and I still ain't get touched

I don't need you, I want you though
And for you, I cut off all them other hoes
And if it is a problem, you know who to tell
Knock 'em down like it's dominos, adios
I got some problems, I know
I tried to calm down but I can't though
I made a couple bands in the bando
Feds came inside so I jumped out the window
Mhmm, chyea
Pick up the Glock go spray it
The gyals gonna come to me, I don't chase it
I need exotic gyal me no basic
Yeah, yeah, no phones, ID when you walk in
I heard the opps out here keep talking
Keep playing get put in a coffin
I'm with the wuggies on the way to Boston
Diamonds on my neck, water wet, like a faucet
Cops on my ass, got my gun and I tossed it
I know that he broke 'cause that boy always shoplift
And we don't take Lyft no more
Back to back SUVs like the president
And we donâ€™t catch licks no more
All four pockets full, 4PF, get check

[Chorus]
Walk in the spot it's just me and my bitch and my chop
Move hot, get shot
He gon' die on the spot
Go get 'em, get rid of him
Bullets too fast can't dodge, they hitting em
I don't got time for these hoes
They be acting like babies, I ain't babysitting em
I told Lisa to pass me my nina
Diamonds water, my neck Aquafina
Fuck that bitch, I don't need that bitch
She thought I was dumb, I ain't seeding shit
She want me to shoot up the club
I hit it one night
To pull up, she a dub
I know why they mad, I know why they hate
'Cause Smooky MarGielaa he do what he want
New Lambo truck with the trunk in the front
Opps talk hot and I still ain't get touchedEmbed
