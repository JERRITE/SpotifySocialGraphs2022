Manifest Reality Lyrics[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and take a breath
Just sit and be yourself
Everything comes from our mind
Nothing exists from its side
When I was young, I had to change the world
Now I know I can only change myself
Leaders can't save the day
It's up to us, there is no other way

[Verse 2]
Teachers only show us the way
It's up to us to practice every day
Look for answers near and far
You are perfect just the way you are
Do your best, do no harm
Watch your mind, Siddhartha taught
Hatred and anger are burning coals
Don't hang on, you have to let it go
[Chorus]
Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality
Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Deep inside, you know the truth
Let your light come shining through
All these things that we know
We have to be, we have to show
Putting others before ourselves
There is no limit to who we help
With the love that we share
That we spread everywhere

[Chorus]
Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality
Be the change you wanna see
