I Ain’t Gone Hold Ya Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama & Jeezy]
Oh yeah
This what y'all been waitin' for?
Snowman, we back at it (Yeah)
We talkin' Quality Street Music (I ain't gon' hold you)
We the originators (Let's go)
DJ Drama (Helluva made the beat, baby)

[Verse: Jeezy]
I ain't gon' hold you, feel like I got the world on my shoulders
Remind me of weighin' up them boulders
Catch me in an all white thing, chillin' at the red light
Top down and that motherfucker gorgeous
What about that Royal Oak AP with the black face
Yeah, that motherfucker blacker than some Folgers
You rollin' with a real one, all them bitches really love me out herе
Like they love Soulja Slim in thе 'Nolia
I ain't gon' hold you
Yeah, your boy a lil' bipolar, half general, half soldier
Yeah, I got a hand full of hair while I hit it from the back
While a real nigga blowin' on some doja (Let's go)
Then I'm gon' fold her
When I get down, I'm a mold her
Same time keepin' my composure
If she keep makin' them faces, keep talkin' to me right
In the mornin' I'ma roll her back over
Playtime's over
Came to give you motherfuckers closure
Real niggas only, no posers
If you really got it out the mud like the Rollie on your wrist (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
Knock that motherfuckin' dirt up off your shoulders
I ain't gon' hold ya
Nigga really got it with the soda (Yeah)
Really hit them niggas in the motor
Yeah, a nigga really made them deals on the first and the third 'cause a nigga really tryna hit his quota
What you know about that odor?
Yeah, a nigga came from the corner, now I'm legal like Tommy Mottola (Get 'em Snow)
Yeah, I really came through the hood in that all white Lamb and the first one to do it like Soulja
I ain't gon' hold you
Nigga came through in all black, motherfuckers thought I played for the Raiders
Talkin' to a street nigga, yeah, I turned real estate mogul, ain't no tellin' what I paid for them acres (That's facts)
All about that paper
Never been no hatin' in my nature
Don't make me Louis V suitcase you
Make a nigga cry, got so much money in the safe
You gon' think a motherfucker went and maced you
Can't let 'em break you (Yeah)
No, no, you can't let 'em break you
No, you can't let these motherfuckers snake you
Nigga, when this rap shit done get that Magic Johnson money like that nigga when he done with the Lakers (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
I ain't gon' hold you
Everything I did, I done told you
Everything I said, I done showed you
Did this one for my day one niggas, say what you say, can't say a nigga ain't growed you
Name a nigga colder?
Matter fact name a nigga bolder?
Matter fact let me name a nigga for you
Talking 'bout the B-I-G to the S-N-O
But you already know, I done told you
I ain't gon' hold you (Gangsta Grillz)
[Outro: DJ Drama]
I ain't gon' hold y'all
We the greatest to ever do it
Big Snow (Big Snow)
DJ Drama
