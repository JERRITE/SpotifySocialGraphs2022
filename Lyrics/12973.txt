In the Morning I’ll Be Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ll wipe your cares away
That I might spare you pain
Let everybody say that I’m gone for ya
Say you’re my baby
We’re sublimating

[Chorus]
I’ll write a hymn again
(I’ll write a hymn again)
I’ll be your woman (woman)
Keep on believing in
Our own healing
Oh, baby
[Verse 2]
I’ll wrap myself around you
Where we can’t be found
I’ll hide you from the world
’Til we’re forgotten
Say you’re my baby
We’re sublimating

[Chorus]
I’ll write a hymn again
(I’ll write a hymn again)
I’ll be your woman (woman)
Keep on believing in
Our own healing

[Refrain - Outro]
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeah
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeah
Though our bodies have betrayed us
In a million different ways
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeahYou might also like3Embed
