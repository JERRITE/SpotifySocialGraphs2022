Boy/Girl Lyrics[Verse 1: Julian]
I'm a girl alright
Love girl, warm and cold
A matter of eyes and motions
Feeling a moment of cold skin
Warm skin!

[Verse 2: Julian]
I'm a girl alright
Love girl, warm and cold
A matter of eyes and feelings
[Verse 3: Julian]
I'm a girl alright
Love girl, warm and cold
A matter of eyes and motions
In years, I'm your love
Girl ice, lover girl

[Hook: Julian]
I'm a girl girl girl
Girl girl girl girl girl

[Hook: Jehnny]
Boy boy boy boy

[Verse 4: Jehnny]
He cried out boy boy
My man tries to escape
She said
Give it and have me boy

[Verse 5: Jehnny]
Boy love boy love
Trying to stop himself
Boy boy it's mine
Stuff it...
