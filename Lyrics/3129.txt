Bunk Rock Bitch Lyrics[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Konichiwa bitches come visit I call it the apartment
A 6 by 3 of whatever brings out your inner woman
I rock your body the twat is creamy and hot as sake
Let me inside and I'll let you ride on my Kawasaki
Let me get a bit of that bump bump bump bump bump bump bump action
And I'ma hit you with the bump bump bump bump hump with bolt action
I got your number, baby you might wanna slumber
Party over with a undercover brother who wonder
To find out what the D like inside in-between thighs
(Baby won't you tell me what that be like)
I got a fist full of hair and you ain't going nowhere
While I'm done kissing your pear, light on 'cause you wanna stare
Cover your face up with the bedspread you letting the legs spread
(Damn girl you know you got the wet-wet)
Now you calling me humonga, stroking you with the thunda
I have to say I love the way you bunk rock
[Hook]
You ain't never seen a broad
Panties off and just offer herself like this
Bunk rock bitch
And you ain't never seen a broad
Get her rocks off a rockstar nigga like this
So long mama
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
You know the team and the way we drill
'Cause after the party is after the party
On the bus with a bunk rock bitch

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
You feisty and finicky, half a bottle of Hennessy
Tour bus can for sure bust and you full of that energy
Ain't no doubting your southern routing, it's pure and replenishing
Once you swallow, now follow me to the back let's come get in-between
The top and the bottom bunk all in the middle for me
Once little mama peeled off the wrappers [?] is more sweet
Kutty Cal you're working with something, baby boy don't be rough with me
'Cause you know I got a boyfriend that's average when we do it he'll be noticin'
That's when she put on the Magnum with her mouth, wasn't feeling no teeth
And then she hopped on the dragon, bringing out the villain in me
Got a little bit of something for nothing put my name in the pussy for sheez
Can't wait to get a bump full of loving next time when I'm in her city
And I got my mojo and tack right, give women that act right
My foreplay is the crack but then my dick is the glass pipe
My bunk is the hideout, nobody will find out
When she leave she tweaking, looking all spooked 'cause she high now off the bunk rock
You might also like[Hook]
You ain't never seen a broad
Panties off and just offer herself like this
Bunk rock bitch
And you ain't never seen a broad
Get her rocks off a rockstar nigga like this
So long mama
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
You know the team and the way we drill
'Cause after the party is after the party
On the bus with a bunk rock bitch

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
It goes, one little, two little, three little bunk rocks and
Four little, five little, six little bunk rocks then
Seven little, eight little, nine little bunk rocks
More than ten of them bitches share some stories with me
I had fun with them, hung with them, plunged in they hot spots
I tongue split them, done did them, flung them and dropped
Then got drunk with them, sung with them, sprung them if not
Then I bet you none of them ever speak bad about me
To all the ladies who will be your dishes, be on the lookout we're in your town
'Cause I'm looking for a team of butch for her skin and ain't scared to put it down
You can be black or Chinese or a heavenly mix breed, whatever it's gon' be we'll go
'Cause I want that Prada, Gucci Hadana, even when you wearing your nadas, gonna hit the floor
For all the ladies across the globe who ain't been in the bunk
You can do it in the bedroom or bathroom, Buick or whatever you want
An invitation to me sensation, I'll mail it to some
But if you impatient get tired of waiting catch mail in this bunk
[Hook]
You ain't never seen a broad
Panties off and just offer herself like this
Bunk rock bitch
And you ain't never seen a broad
Get her rocks off a rockstar nigga like this
So long mama
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
You know the team and the way we drill
'Cause after the party is after the party
On the bus with a bunk rock bitchEmbed
