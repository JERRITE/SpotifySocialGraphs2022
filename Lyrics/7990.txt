Fireflies Lyrics[Chorus: Luciana]
Open your heart, now you're mine
Here in the dark, we're fireflies
Open your heart and feel the life
I've never felt like this before
I've never felt like this before
Open your heart and feel the life
We're fireflies
We're fireflies
We're fireflies
I've never felt like this before
I've never felt like this before
Open your heart and feel the life
We're fireflies
[Beat break: Bassjackers]

[Chorus: Luciana]
Open your heart, now you're mine
Here in the dark, we're fireflies
Open your heart and feel the life
I've never felt like this before
I've never felt like this before
Open your heart and feel the life
We're fireflies
We're fireflies
We're fireflies
I've never felt like this before
I've never felt like this before
Open your heart and feel the life
We're fireflies

[Beat break: Bassjackers]

We're fireflies
