TranslationsEspañolX-Wing Lyrics[Verse 1]
All these beats go dumb in the stereo
But I'm just too smart for the radio
Masked up like a young Rey Mysterio
Mask off when I'm back in the studio
Mac ain't make it to twenty-seven
Pac ain't make it to twenty-six
B.I.G. ain't make it to twenty-five
It's only right that I gotta get rich
Cut niggas off and I curse niggas out
Niggas thirsty for help, it's a motherfuckin' drought (Bitch, it's dry)
Niggas envy when you famous first
They don't know what they name is worth (They don't know)
Please excuse my grammar (Please)
See, my opps been filled with anna (Okay)
This game like Home Dеpot
Bitch, they got keys, hoes, and hammеrs (For the low, for the low)
Niggas gangsters, killers, and scammers
We was out dodgin' bullets and cameras
When you broke, niggas won't throw slander
Get money, now your ass can't stand us, man
I want a whole lot of green and a pair of nice jeans
Chopper with a new beam and this pair of ice creams
Ever since I was a teen (Uh-huh), I been focused on the cream (Uh-huh)
Want the clothes and the kicks and— (What?)
[Chorus]
And I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam
I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam

[Verse 2]
New mind state in a new spot
Fuck a TikTok, bought a new watch
It's my time now, where my G-Shock?
Fur coat fresh off a sasquatch
Told me to keep it PC
Nah, nigga, I'ma let the MAC pop
Everybody wanna be the man
I'm the nigga counting money in the backdrop
Oh shit, it's the nigga slicker than some lubricant
Young, exuberant
Movin' through the city where your Uber went
Am I killin' it or am I losin' it?
'Stead of counting sheep, I count dollars
Ridin' high, Chevy Impala
If I make that bitch an inch taller, then I upgrade to a Skywalker
Rap elite, I'm top tier
Kill the game, then drop tears
Gassed up, I'm Scarecrow, I reveal your worst fears
Niggas work hard 'til they on Star Island
But I won't stop 'til I own Star Island
Money stack up and I just keep pilin'
Drop-top windshield, Audi five thousand

And I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam
I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam
And I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam
I don't want a car, I want an X-Wing (Yeah)
I'm just on to the next thing
Growing up, I didn't have the best things
Now my diamonds on my neck gleam12Embed
