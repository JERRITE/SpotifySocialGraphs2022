Again and Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, mama, save me, save me
Mama, bless me to my bones
You have started the fire
Ooh, I'm weak now in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
With your poison sting
This is deep and true
I'd do anything
Your sweet perfume
You bleed
Till the well is overflown
You're my gold, my hunger
Where you go, I will follow
Sweet poison sting
I see the light
I see everything in you tonight
I breathe

[Chorus]
In and out here we go, oh oh
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Here mama, I'ma give it back to you

All the stars in the sky so beautiful
In your eyes shine, shine

[Verse 2]
Reaching out, reaching out for you
Just to kiss your mouth
Wanna turn you inside out
Isn't such a thing
As you do to me
Your sweet poison sting
Let's me see
I'll be your king 'cause you are my queen
You might also like[Chorus]
In and out here we go, oh oh
Over and again and again
And all the love you give to me
Mama, I'ma give it back to you

[Bridge]
Oh, don't let it get away
And if we did, we gonna get it back
All in time you and me
We will, we will, we will, we will be

[Chorus]
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Mama, I'ma give it back to you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Turn around here we go, oh oh
Over and again and again
All of the love you give to me
Mama, I'ma give it back to you

Oh and the love
That you ever had I give it back to you
Again
Mama, I'ma give it back to youEmbed
