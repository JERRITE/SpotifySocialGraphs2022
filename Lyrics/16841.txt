If I Ever Fall In Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "Hello" and I said "Hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up in physical attraction (Caught up)
But to my satisfaction
Baby, you were more than just a face

[Chorus: All]
And if I ever (Ever fall)
In love again (Again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (Ever fall)
In love so true (So true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
[Verse 2: All]
(I swear the next time she'll be a friend, oh yeah)
If I say that I can be your one and only
Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need (Need)
I just wanna be the one who serves you (Serve you)
Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share

[Chorus: All]
And if I ever (Ever fall)
In love again (Again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever fall (Ever fall)
In love so true (So true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

[Bridge: All]
My friend
Very next time, she'll be my friend
I need someone who'll be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
My friend
Very next time, she'll be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
My friend
Very next time, she'll be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
My friend
I need someone like you
Very next time, she'll be my friend
You might also like[Chorus: All]
And if I ever fall (Ever fall)
In love again (Again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever fall (Ever fall)
In love so true (So true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you5Embed
