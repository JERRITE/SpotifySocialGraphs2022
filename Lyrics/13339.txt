Die 4 Ur Love Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for the cure for pain
I've been learning how to keep the hurt at bay
Ever since you went away
Didn't even care, left me for dead
I'm still alive
Some days I just don't know why
Was it all a dream of mine?
Everything we left behind
[Pre-Chorus]
If I can't have you
What's the point of all this?
I'm broken in two
Apocalypse

[Chorus]
And I'd die, die, die, die
Die for your love now
Die for your love now
Apocalypse
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'd try, try, try, try
Try for your love now
Try for your love now
Apocalypse
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I was running through a burning field
Thought I saw your face up in the clouds
Are you gonna rescue me?
I'm tripping on a fantasy
But I'd run for miles
If you said you were waiting
Waiting on the other side
Waiting in the afterlife
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'd die, die, die, die
Die for your love now
Die for your love now
Apocalypse
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'd try, try, try, try
Try for your love now
Try for your love now
Apocalypse
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
If I can't have you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
What's the point of all this?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm broken in two
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Apocalypse

[Bridge]
What we had is gone
I'm just holding on
To a trace of you
To a place I knew
What we had is gone
I'm just holding on
To a trace of you
To a place I knew
[Chorus]
Die, die, die, die
Die for your love now
Die for your love now
Apocalypse
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'd try, try, try, try
Try for your love now
Try for your love now
Apocalypse

[Outro]
You know I'd die for your love
You know I'd die for your love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Die for your love
Die for your love
You know I'd die for your love
You know I'd die for your love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Die for your love
Die for your love
(Die for your love now)
You know I'd die for your love
You know I'd die for your love
(Die for your love now)
Die for your love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Die for your love
(Die for your love now)
You know I'd die for your love
You know I'd die for your love
(Die for your love now)
Die for your love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Die for your love2Embed
