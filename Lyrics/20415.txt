Move All Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you like me in blue
So I wear a couple shades for you, shades for you
I never want it to end
So I'll keep holding on to the thread, on to the thread

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time it's like this
You can get me golden
You can be my rhythm as you still get me dancing
You can get me dancing
[Chorus]
We can move all night if you want me to
We can move all night, just gotta say you do
We can move all night, mm
We can move all night if you want me to
We can move all night, just gotta say you do
We can move all night, mm

[Post-Chorus]
We can move all night
We can move all night
We can move all night

[Verse 2]
I know you like me in red
So I wear it when I'm in your bed, in your bed
Don't wear my heart on my sleeve
So I'll see you getting in my head, in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time it's like this
You can get me golden
You can be my rhythm as you still get me dancing
You can get me dancing

[Chorus]
We can move all night if you want me to
We can move all night, just gotta say you do
We can move all night, mm
We can move all night if you want me to
We can move all night, just gotta say you do
We can move all night, mm

We can move all night
We can move all night
We can move all night
We can move all nightEmbed
