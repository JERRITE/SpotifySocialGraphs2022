EDM Bubble Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm celebrating in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, ’cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Instrumental Drop]

[Chorus]
I’m celebrating in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
I'm celebrating in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well in bubble, bubble, bubbles
You gonna turn me now, 'cause I might as well get in trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
