(Wish I Didn’t Have to) Lie [Remix] Lyrics[Chorus: Catie Turner]
I don't hate you
I just hate the way I miss you
And I hate the way it hits me at night

[Verse 1: Catie Turner]
You ruined the J-Train
You ruined Fleetwood for me too
I only think about the good days
Know it's cause I'm scared to let go of you
You fucked up New Jersey
You fucked up the way I see myself
I don't think of how you hurt me
But it hurts like hell

[Verse 2: Catie Turner]
It means I'm still in denial, It's a cycle
Another year flies by
It means that I'm still waiting for the day you show up at my door

[Chorus: Catie Turner]
Oh I don't hate you
I just hate the way I miss you
And I hate the way it hits me at night

I don't hate you
I just hate the way I love you
And I hate the way I tell myself I'm fine

[Verse 3: Jordy]
You messed up late-night drives
You messed up Target for me too
I don't throw away our Polaroids
And I know it's cause I'm scared to tell the truth
It's always the littlest things
Sweatshirts and video games
And you probably don't feel the same
You might also like[Chorus: Catie Turner & Jordy]
I don't hate you
I just hate the way I miss you
And I hate the way it hits me at night

I don't hate you
I just hate the way I love you
And I hate the way I tell myself I'm fine

[Bridge: Catie Turner & Jordy]
I wish I didn't have to lie
Ooh,ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Wish I didn't have to lie
Ooh,ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Wish I didn’t have to (wish I didn’t have to)

[Chorus: Catie Turner & Jordy]
I don't hate you
I just hate the way I miss you
And I hate the way it hits me at night

I don't hate you
I just hate the way I love you
And I hate the way I tell myself I'm fine

I wish I didn't have to lie
Wish I didn't have to lieEmbed
