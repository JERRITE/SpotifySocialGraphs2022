Industry Invasion Lyrics[Intro]
Gang
Ayy, where [?] at?
He told me make the song anyway
He sleek
Alright, fuck it (Fuck it)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
I'm too real, that why these fuck niggas here can't feel me (Nigga can't feel me)
I'm still in these streets, this door still open to kill me (Still open to kill me)
Money don't make me a nigga, I already done ran through millions (I ran through shit)
Fuck this rap shit, I see my target, I'ma shoot it from— Mm-mm-mm
( Wyatt Get To It )
Pull up
This that industry invasion
Come from the trenches where it made me (It made me)
None of  these labels bettеr not pay me (Uh-huh)
You either gon' lovе me or hate me (Facts)
I don't fuck with none of these rappers
Surrounded by killers, connected with trappers (Trappers)
I ain't doin' none of this get-back
I came in with me, that's how I'm gon' end it (That's how I'ma end it)
Only the streets support me, that's why I go diamond in the streets (Everytime)
I ain't no role model, this life I live, you can't be me (You can't)
I was with Trey, we started with a ounce, we worked our way to a P (To a P)
Lookin' up the Beamz, layin' down on the law, tryna get rich and get us a ki (Yeah)
This that industry invasion
Ain't no nigga that I'm praisin' (Uh-uh)
Fuck you, I don't need niggas to plug me 'cause none of these niggas can turn me up
Niggas be ridin' the wave
I stay in my lane, 'cause I know what's up (I do)
Rappin', portrayin' they killers, but, in real life they ain't killed nothin' (Ain't killed—)
I come through in the Lamb', fresh out the stolo, all black Impala (Skrrt)
Bitches say I'm a dog unless I got diamonds on my collar
They all look at me crazy 'cause I want me a song with Justin Beiber (Yeah)
Theys say one of the hottest rapper
'Cause a nigga is cappin', I don't believe 'em (Facts)
[Chorus]
This that industry invasion (Yeah, yeah)
Force my time, stop bein' patient (Oh-oh)
I live by the street code, niggas can't come across (Niggas can't come across)
Know I can't bill it, I can't fold, cut from a different cloth (Cut from a different cloth)
Know I can't sell my soul, I miss the ones I lost (I miss the ones I lost)

[Verse 2]
They say ain't got no soul, they double-check my pulse (Say ain't got no soul)
I left some blood in the street, cameras surround my home (Surround my home)
Death and 'nem took my dawgs, so I can't talk to the rappin' about it (Start rappin' about it)
Fortune teller seen death on my car, done grabbed my gun, and I shot it (Grrah)
Ayy, the industry industry don't like the way I'm invadin' it (I'm invadin' it)
Ayy, you can't cancel me, if I want to, I'm sayin' it (I want to, I'll sayin' it)
Ayy, money can't buy me bitches because I'm real first (Because I'm real first)
Before you diss me in a song, go on a drill first (Ayy, get active)
Ayy, I fuck with Kodak 'cause all my niggas vultures too (They be vultures too)
I bought the car and chase the nigga, like, "Where you runnin' to?" (Where you goin'?)
My bitch, she bad, kn0ow she a dime, I been had wanted you (I been had wanted you)
Lovin' me not gon' be easy, bae, I had warned you (I had warned you)
I ain't playin' games, steppin' on shit, niggas can't step to me (Niggas can't step to me)
I ain't got no feelings, no remorse, I ain't got nothin' left in me (I ain't got nothin' left in me)
Crash 'bout my dawg, thought he was right, but he went left on me (But, shit, he left on me)
Did everything I can, what y'all expect form me? (What y'all expect form me?)

[Chorus]
This that industry invasion (Street)
Nigga, this that industry invasion (Invasion)
Ayy, the industry don't like the way I'm invadin' it (I'm invadin' it)
This that industry invasion
Nigga, this that industry invasion
Ayy, the industry don't like the way I'm invadin' itYou might also likeEmbed
