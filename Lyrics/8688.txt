Art for Artâ€™s Sake Lyrics[Verse 1: Eric Stewart]
Gimme your body
Gimme your mind
Open your heart
Pull down the blind
Gimme your love
Gimme it all
Gimme in the kitchen gimme in the hall

[Chorus: Eric Stewart]
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
[Verse 2: Eric Stewart]
Gimme the readys
Gimme the cash
Gimme a bullet
Gimme a smash
Gimme a silver
Gimme a gold
Make it a million for when I get old

[Chorus: Eric Stewart]
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake

[Post-Chorus: Lol Creme]
Money talks so listen to it
Money talks to me
Anyone can understand it
Money can't be beat
Oh no

[Bridge: Kevin Godley & Graham Gouldman]
When you get down
Down to the root
Don't give a damn
Don't give a hoot
Still gotta keep makin' the loot
Chauffeur driven
Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin'
Make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven
You might also like[Verse 3: Eric Stewart]
Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Burying me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays

[Chorus: Eric Stewart]
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sakeEmbed
