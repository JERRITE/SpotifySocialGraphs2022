If Youâ€™re Hearing This Lyrics[Chorus: Parson James & Betty Who]
We all wanna believe
Wanna believe in something
'Cause if we believe in nothing
Then what do we have? What do we have?
We all wanna be loved
All wanna love somebody
'Cause if we ain't got nobody
Then what do we have? What do we have?

[Verse 1: Parson James]
If you're hearing this, I'm at King and 5th
Eight to ten I'll sit at this table for two
In a Dodgers cap, drinking coffee black
Wondering where you're at
[Hook: Parson James]
I'll be waiting, be waiting for you
(For you, for you, for you)
I've been waiting, been waiting for you
(For you, for you, for you, for you)

[Chorus: Parson James & Betty Who]
We all wanna believe
Wanna believe in something
'Cause if we believe in nothing
Then what do we have? What do we have?
We all wanna be loved
I wanna love somebody
'Cause if we ain't got nobody
Then what do we have? What do we have?

[Verse 2: Betty Who]
If you're hearing this, know I'm listening
I'm still wandering down these lost avenues
But I know one day
Clear blue skies are grey
I'll walk in and you'll say

[Hook: Betty Who & Parson James]
"I've been waiting, been waiting for you" (You, you)
I've been waiting, been waiting for you
(For you, for you, for you, for you)

If you're hearing this, I'm at King and 5th
Eight to ten I'll sit at this table for two
But I know one day
Clear blue skies are grey
I'll walk in and you'll say

[Hook: Parson James, Betty Who & Both]
"I've been waiting, been waiting for you"
(For you, for you, for you, for you)
I've been waiting, been waiting for you
(Woah)
(For you, for you, for you)
I've been waiting, been waiting for you, for you
(For you, for you)7Embed
