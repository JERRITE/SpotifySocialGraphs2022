☆ (Star) Lyrics[Intro]
I can see the scars, they're blinding
All up in my head, all up in my head
I can see the stars, they're shinin'
It's all up in my head, all up in my head

[Chorus: Namasenda]
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
I can see it all up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
I can see it all up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
[Verse 1: Namasenda]
Think they know me, life of the party
But they don't wanna see me feeling lonely
She's got it all together but I’m so messed up
She’s gonna blow this year but the pain won't stop
She's so lucky, mm
But shе cry, cry, cries

[Verse 2: Oklou]
Ripping out the parts, she's dying
All up in my hеad, all up in my head
The parts where she feels, she's hanging
All up in my head, print it on my skin
Let me throw away this feeling
All up in the sky, all up in heavens
I will never see a wedding
Away from my head, away from my head

[Chorus: Namasenda]
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
I can see it all up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
I can see it all up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
All up in my head, all up in my head
