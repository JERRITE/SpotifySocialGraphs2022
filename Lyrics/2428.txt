FM$ (Freak My Shit) Lyrics[Intro: Legacy]
I could fall off today
Still steal a famous nigga ho
I'm a young fly nigga fasho

[Chorus: Legacy]
Okay, now put yo ass, on my dick, and pose on this shit
Okay now Freak my Shit, freak my shit, freak my shit
Bitch freak my shit
Freak my shit, freak my shit, freak my shit
Bitch freak my shit
I said I'm about to fuck who I'm dancin' with
I'm-I'm about to fuck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to fuck who I'm dancin' with
Shout out to the fuckin' DJ for playin' this shit (Legacy)
[Verse 1: Legacy]
Ass all over me
Drunk, thats the only way I'm 'posed to be
My ex say I'm trippin', the money made me different
I said bitch you just addicted, because of what the dick did
Do you like this position? Do you like this position?
Did the sip you sippin’ get you interested in kissin' women?
Is it fuck your inhibition?
Fu-fuck your inhibition?
Bring that ass back, like it's stuck in intermission
Cute chick with the hair curly
She ride that dick till it get early
Her pussy clean but she dance dirty
Fuck me getting blown out, bitch I am Kirby
You be makin' love too long, do me like nig gone
Do me like your nigga gone
The baddest girls in LA, in the bay, and I do 'em even when I'm on break
So if I fall off today
I'll still steal a famous nigga ho, I'm a young fly nigga fasho

[Chorus: Legacy]
Okay, now putcho ass, on my dick, and pose on this shit
Okay now Freak my Shit, freak my shit, freak my shit
Bitch freak my shit
Freak my shit, freak my shit, freak my shit
Bitch freak my shit
I said I'm about to fuck who I'm dancin' with
I'm-I'm about to fuck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to fuck who I'm dancin' with
Shout out to the fuckin' DJ for playin' this shit, ayy

If your bitch came up to me, homie dats mackin'
Swag killin' you in what you call ya' best outfit
Plenty more so it's for sure we gettin' on these whores
Have an orgy in this bitch, no more locked doors
You a wall flower, and I'm West North
But I got my Jordan's on, so don't step on em
Be up in here flexin,' I might have to drop ya' homes
Tell the mothafuckin' DJ to turn the Waka on
But I'mma turn it down, because there's too much pussy
I'mma GoGo at these B-Birds
Call em whoopees
Can't do a sausage fest, come on girl make it juicy
Dancin' on me, african booty booty call it judy
Tonight its going down, I only came out here for work
I said I liked ya girl, but actions speak louder than words
I didn’t do nothing that bitch came onto me first
I can’t lie I had some money; told that bitch to work. hah..
(told that bitch to work)
Okay now put yo ass on my dick, on my dick o-on my dick

[Chorus: Legacy]
Okay now Freak my Shit, freak my shit, freak my shit
