Itâ€™s You I Like LyricsIt's you I like,
It's not the things you wear,
It's not the way you do your hair
But it's you I like

The way you are right now,
The way down deep inside you
Not the things that hide you,
Not your toys
They're just beside you.
But it's you I like
Every part of you.
Your skin, your eyes, your feelings
Whether old or new

I hope that you'll remember
Even when you're feeling blue
That it's you I like,
It's you yourself
It's you.
It's you I like.1Embed
