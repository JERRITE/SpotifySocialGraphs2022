Milk & Honey (Alt Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Honey here we are
Dreaming in the dark, troubles seem so far
Their thoughts were ours
But now we dream apart, now we dream apart
Oil and water

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm just content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar
[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey, well honey I tried
You just want more, and now it's all gone

[Verse 2]
Honey you're so kind
Oh you're full of light, you show me your best side
You pick mе every rose in sight, but all thе roses died
I'd rather keep them alive
Roots grow slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar

[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey, well honey I tried
You just want more, you just want more
You might also like[Bridge]
Honey I tried
To make it work, you're unsatisfied
You make it worse
Honey I'd die

[Chorus]
Still all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey, you can't take the sting
You live for overkill, but you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey, well honey I tried

[Outro]
You just want more, you just want more
You just want more
And now it's all goneEmbed
