Miracle Aligner Lyrics[Chorus]
Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Fifty feet tall and revved up too high
All of our exchanges are by candlelight, I just realised
He’ll walk through the walls and creep up behind
Make sense of the maze that you were stuck outside
Cover your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Often the humble kind but he can’t deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines tonight

[Chorus]
Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So what’s the wish? He’ll make it come true
Simple as a line out of a doo-wop tune, he’ll make the moves

[Pre-Chorus]
Often the humble kind but he can’t deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines tonight

[Chorus]
Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohYou might also like20Embed
