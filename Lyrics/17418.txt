Breathe Lyrics[PIRAGUA GUY]
Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
Respira...

[NINA]
Breathe

[PIRAGUA GUY/SONNY/USNAVI/MAN]
Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira
[NINA]
This is my street
I smile at the faces I’ve known all my life
They regard me with pride
And everyone’s sweet
They say, “You’re going places"
So how can I say that, while I was away
I had so much to hide?
Hey guys, it’s me
The biggest disappointment you know
The kid couldn’t hack it
She’s back and she’s walkin’ real slow
Welcome home, just breathe

Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira

[NINA (COMPANY)]
As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise
“Ay, te adoro, te quiero” (Te adoro)
The neighborhood waved
And said, “Nina, be brave (Te quiero)
And you’re gonna be fine!” (Respira)
And maybe it’s me
But it all seems like lifetimes ago (Respira)
So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
“Hey, I’m home?”

Mira, Nina

Hey

[COMPANY]
No me preocupo por ella

[NINA]
They’re not worried about me

[COMPANY]
Mira, allí esta nuestra estrella

[NINA]
They are all counting on me to succeed

[COMPANY]
Ella sí da la talla

[NINA (COMPANY)]
I am the one who made it out (Ah)
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should have just stayed home (Mira, Nina)
When I was a child I stayed wide awake
Climbed to the highest place
On every fire escape
Restless to climb (Respira)
I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why (Respira)
I’m coming back home? (Ah)
With my eyes on the horizon
Just me and the GWB
Asking, “Gee, Nina, what’ll you be?"
Straighten the spine, smile for the neighbors
Everything’s fine, everything’s cool
The standard reply, “Lots of tests, lots of papers"
Smile, wave goodbye and pray to the sky, oh, god
And what will my parents say?

[COMPANY]
Nina

[NINA]
Can I go in there and say…

[COMPANY]
Nina

[NINA]
“I know that I’m letting you down?”
