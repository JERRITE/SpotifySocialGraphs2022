Pretty MF Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
All my real bitches, put your middle fingers up
Let a nigga know that you don't give a fuck
I don't wanna talk, nigga, you ain't got enough
Gotta spend the whole thing, couple thousand ain't enough

[Chorus]
Cap ass, wack ass, flexin' ass broke nigga
Swear you're gettin' money, but you're really sellin' hope, nigga
You ain't my type, Rubi need a whole G.O.A.T., nigga
Lavish ass life with a mansion and a boat, nigga
[Verse 1]
Did I stutter? (Huh?) Pretty motherfucker (Ooh)
Married to the money, nigga, I could never love you (I could never love you)
Only one Rubi, there can never be another (Never be another)
Got a big mouth, nigga, I can never fuck you (Nah)
Fuck a nigga good in the back of the 'Bach (Yeah)
Pussy so good, he be callin' it crack (Yeah)
Change your whole life, nigga, big old facts (Hey)
Go and get the money, nigga, bring that back

[Pre-Chorus]
All my real bitches, put your middle fingers up
Let a nigga know that you don't give a fuck
I don't wanna talk, nigga, you ain't got enough
Gotta spend the whole thing, couple thousand ain't enough

[Chorus]
Cap ass, wack ass, flexin' ass broke nigga
Swear you're gettin' money, but you're really sellin' hope, nigga
You ain't my type, Rubi need a whole G.O.A.T., nigga
Lavish ass life with a mansion and a boat, nigga

[Verse 2]
Get the money, sis, get the money
Break a nigga ass down to his last hundred
Make a nigga buy you everything you ever wanted
Gotta keep up, can't be runnin' out of money
Make a rich nigga give me head in the Wraith (Ooh)
Want a bad bitch? Nigga, you gon' pay
I don't buy dreams, it ain't nothin' to say (Shit)
Got my own money, but I want your cake

Gotta spend the whole thing, couple thousand ain't enough

[Chorus]
Cap ass, wack ass, flexin' ass broke nigga
Swear you're gettin' money, but you're really sellin' hope, nigga
You ain't my type, Rubi need a whole G.O.A.T., nigga
Lavish ass life with a mansion and a boat, nigga

[Outro]
Get the money, sis, get the money
Break a nigga ass down to his last hundred
Get the money, sis, get the money1Embed
