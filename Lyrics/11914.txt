Falling (blackbear Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Trevor Daniel]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
[Verse: Trevor Daniel]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya'

[Bridge: blackbear]
Yeah, I needed you, needed you, needed you the most
Now I'm hurting, I'm hurting, you went ghost
Promise I'm done with the last one I thought I loved
'Cause she ain't you

[Chorus: blackbear & Trevor Daniel]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Outro: Trevor Daniel]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it downYou might also like5Embed
