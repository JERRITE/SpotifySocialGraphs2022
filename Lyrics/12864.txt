Moving To Neptune Lyrics[Verse One]
Standing on the bed
And laying on the floor
(Who are you kidding?)
You're feeling all the weight
They're making you sore
(Said who are you kidding?)
And you can't just shake it
You can't just fake it
And you can't just break it in two
You're living for the gold
And messing with the dirt
(Who are you kidding?)
You're wading through the water
Wading through the hurt
(Said who are you kidding?)
And you can't just shake it
You can't just fake it
You can't just break it in two

[Chorus]
So wrap it up
Take it back
We gon' jump it off this track
Could you follow me?
I'll follow you
Everyone is moving to Neptune
Moving to Neptune

[Verse Two]
You wanna stalk in
You're in too deep
(Who are you kidding?)
We'll throw it to the wolves
And pull it to Celine
(Said Who are you kidding?)
And you can't just shake it
You can't just fake it
You can't just break it in two
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Who are you kidding [3x]
Who ?

[Chorus (2x)]
So wrap it up
Take it back
We gon' jump it off this track
Could you follow me?
I'll follow you
Everyone is moving to Neptune
