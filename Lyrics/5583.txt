Enemy (from the series Arcane League of Legends) Lyrics[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground
I′m searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you, "You're the greatest"
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I′m ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind
And I′m waiting for the time
When I show you what it′s like
To be words spit in a mic

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you, "You're the greatest"
But once you turn, they hate us
You might also like[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)

[Verse 3: Dan Reynolds]
They say, "pray it away"
I swear, that I′ll never be a saint, no way
A chair in the corner is my place I stay
I shake, and I think about the powers it play, the powers it play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be chained
But keep on praying
Goodbye

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)
[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way
My enemy (I swear)
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint
(Look out for yourself)1Embed
