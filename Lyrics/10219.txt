Next To Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hate that I love you
Hate that I love you
Try not, but I do
Oh, but it feels so good, so good
I'm so drunk in love now
So drunk in love now
Drinking about you
Oh, but it feels so good, so good

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all I see
Is everything that we could be
You'll never be alone with me
You'll never be alone with me
Oh, all you need
Is just a little clarity
You'll never be alone with me
You'll never be alone
[Chorus]
Right next to me
(Right next to me)
Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me
(Right next to me)

[Verse 2]
I look into your eyes
Look into your eyes
Ooh, is you shaking?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life, for life
Just stay here for one night
Stay here for one night
Oh, don't say maybe
Doesn't mean we're bound for life, for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all I see
Is everything that we could be
You'll never be alone with me
You'll never be alone with me
Oh, all you need
Is just a little clarity
You'll never be alone with me
You'll never be alone
You might also like[Chorus]
Right next to me
(Right next to me)
Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me all night
(Right next to me)
Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me all night

[Outro]
I hate that I love you
Hate that I love you
Try not, but I do
Oh, but it feels so good, so good1Embed
