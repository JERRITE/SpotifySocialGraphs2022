Your Crowning Glory LyricsSome girls are fair
Some are jolly and fit
Some have a well-bred air
Or a well-wholed wit

Each one's a jewel
With a singular shine
A work of art
With it's own rare design

Dear little girl
You are terribly blessed
But it's your heart of gold
I love the best
And that will be your crowning glory
Your whole life through
It'll always be your crowning glory
The most glorious part of you

Some boys can waltz
Some guys can groove
Strike an elegant pose
With the really good clothes
Some seem to have no faults
But we never like those
No we don't
He'll praise your eyes
Your melodious laugh
Call you more lovely than others by half
The one who's right
My gorgeous prince
Will be honest and true
He'll believe in me too
And prize your heart of gold the way I do

He'll know that will be your crowning glory your whole life through
Your love will see that it's your crowning glory
The most glorious part of you and you
And you
And you
You might also likeThat will be your crowning glory
Darling when they tell your story
They'll call your heart of gold your crowning glory
The most glorious part of youEmbed
