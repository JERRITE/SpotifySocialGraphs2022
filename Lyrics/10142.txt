TranslationsEnglishHave U Found What Ur Looking For? Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Tied up, hazy, and emotionally unaware
Everest is the bathroom at the top of the goddamn stairs
I could harvest every dream that I've ever had
Headaches beat me down to a lifeless stare

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) Your blissful eyes will open
(Ooh) A brand new voice has spoken
[Chorus]
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)
I'm hopin' that maybe one day, it could start to make sense (Ooh)
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Heartbreak's usеful to a man that is on a fence
He's not faithful to a God full of consеquence
Golden lady with a mind that could cut a stone
Who could love me if I start giving you my soul?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) Your blissful eyes will open
(Ooh) A brand new voice has spoken

[Chorus]
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)
I'm hopin' that maybe one day, it could start to make sense (Ooh)
Have you found what you're looking for? (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Liquid conscience spinning deeper
Always wanting to see clearer
Will I find the tiger's dinner?
Waiting while my hair grows thinner
Oh, won't someone show me the way?
Oh, won't someone show me who I am?

Have you found what you're looking for?
Have you found what you're looking for?
Have you found what you're looking for?
Have you found what you're looking for?
Won't someone show me who I am?
