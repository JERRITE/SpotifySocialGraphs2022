We Are One Lyrics[Verse 1]
[SIMBA]
As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned
But you'll see every day
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one
[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one

[Verse 2]
[KIARA]
If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me the way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart?
Or am I just one part of some big plan?

[SIMBA]
Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one
You might also like[Verse 3]
[SIMBA]
We are one, you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun
All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see
We are one!

[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one

(chorus is repeated and ad-libbed until the end)2Embed
