Standing Next to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Want her, have her, two years have gone now
But I can't relate to the never-ending games that you play
As desire passes through, then you're open to the truth
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

[Verse 2]
The one you fell for makes it seem juvenile
And you'll laugh at yourself again and again
And we'll drink to the thought she'll remember you
Maybe tomorrow
[Chorus]
And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Want her, have her, two years have gone now
But I can't relate to the never-ending games that you play
As desire passes through, then you're open to the truth
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
And your love is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to meYou might also like8Embed
