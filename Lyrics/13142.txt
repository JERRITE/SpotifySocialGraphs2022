Do You Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was inevitable, I knew it well
Whatever I had to do, I’d do it well
It was you
I had to do you well

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay in the light so I can see your face
Stay in the light
Stay in the light so I can see your face
Stay in the light
[Chorus]
I want to see you out there
In the light
I want to see you out there
In the light
I want to see you out there
In the light
I want to see you out there
In the light

[Verse 2]
It was inevitable, I knew it well
Whatever I had to do, I’d do it well
It was true
I had to do you well

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay in the light so I can see your face
Stay in the light
Stay in the light so I can see your face
Stay in the light

[Chorus]
I want to see you out therе
In the light
I want to see you out there
In thе light
I want to see you out there
In the light
I want to see you out there
In the light

Stay in the light
