Go Big or Go Home Lyrics[Intro]
(Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Don't feel like going home
But all my cash is gone
Yeah, I got nothing to do tonight
I'm passed out on the floor
Up in the hotel bar
But it don't matter, cause I'm feeling fine
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking life's too short; it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

[Chorus]
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

[Verse 2]
I gave the dice a roll
And then we lost control
You know we're lucky that we survived
Cause when we jumped the ship
Oh, man, that boat, it flipped
But we should do it all again tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking life's too short; it's passing by
So if we're gonna go at all
Go big or go
You might also like[Chorus]
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home

[Bridge]
Giving my body all the things I need
Rescue me with a little whiskey
Staying out, don't need no sleep
I'll sleep when I'm dead; you can bury me
I'll sleep when I'm dead; you can bury me

[Verse 3]
I guess I'm going home
Cause all my cash is gone
I spent it all trying to feel alive
Go big or go

[Chorus]
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
[Outro]
It's getting crazy
We're gonna do some things that we won't forget
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home
I'm going crazy
I'm gonna live my life; I got no regrets
(Go! Go!)
Go big or go home4Embed
