Smoke & Drive Lyrics[Intro: Weezer, Yung Pinch & Myles Parrish]
Hey, hey (Beach boy in this ho)
Hey, hey (blackbear in this ho)
(P-Lo in this ho)
Hey, hey
P-P-P-Lo, time to bring the bass back

[Chorus: blackbear]
Hey, hey, when I'm on the 405, all I do is smoke and drive
All the things I'm finna do to you, all our dreams is coming true
Got you shotgun in my ride, got my hand up on that thigh
When I'm on the 405, all I do is smoke and drive
[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
Yeah, look
Pour up a four, bitch, here we go, juice county on the roll, yeah
I stick to the code, these bitches, they know
Them boys from the beach ain't no joke (Ain't no joke)
I roll up that weed, make you choke (Make you, ugh)
It's me, Bear, and P on the low (On the low)
405 to the coast, beach boy in this woe
I'm on another wave, there's nothing I can say
Slowly drifting to my grave, no way I can be saved, no
I'm sick as they come, these bitches, they dumb
That coke in her nose make her numb (Make her numb)
That lean in my cup got me slumped (Got me slumped, shit)
Forever, I'ma be young

[Chorus: blackbear]
Hey, hey, when I'm on the 405, all I do is smoke and drive
All the things I'm finna do to you, all our dreams is coming true
Got you shotgun in my ride, got my hand up on that thigh
When I'm on the 405, all I do is smoke and drive

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Light up and smoke this, don't fuck with that old shit, ayy
Westside, where my coast lives, we stay right by the ocean
Where the parties be so lit, smoke tree in the open
Keep a bad one from Oakland, she stay talkin' the most shit, ayy, ayy
But she still gon' roll my weed up, let me hit it when we meet up
But that's all she get, donâ€™t swipe my Visa, ayy (No)
I'm on the up now, brown in my cup now, yeah (Yeah)
Don't give a fuck now, she rollin' up now, yeah
