Miss Diva Lyrics[Chorus: One Acen]
I love how you step, Miss Diva
Grind for the best items
We doing up flex, new freezers
You the realest one on my team
Yeah, Miss Diva
Grind for the best items
We doing up flex, new freezers
You the realest one on my

[Verse 1: One Acen]
Right hand, you're my go to (Woah)
Touch down when I'm local (Flex)
Nice for what, she ain't really social (No)
She ain't looking for no man that's old news (Old news)
Stay home, that's a whole mood (That's a mood)
Drip good, she working it right (Drip drip)
Thick too, curvy sides
Miss, you deserve to be wifed (Girl you the wife)
I swear you got me hooked, ah yeah (Ah yeah)
Got them other girls shook, ah yeah (Ah yeah)
Girl tell me where you wanna go
Any place we can book, ah yeah (Book flights)
I'm feeling like I'm lit, ah yeah (Feeling lit)
Got them other girls sick, ah yeah (Bad stomach)
Girl tell me where you wanna go
Cah' I love to flex, tell me what's next
[Chorus: One Acen]
I love how you step, Miss Diva (Step)
Grind for the best items (Best)
We doing up flex, new freezers
You the realest one on my team (Realest one on my team)
Yeah, Miss Diva
Grind for the best items (Best)
We doing up flex, new freezers
You the realest one on my (Ouch)

[Verse 2: Yungen]
Let me hit this one time
This one ain't no punchline (Mhm)
Girl you look like a magnum in the sunshine (Mad)
Let me melt you with a one whine
She said "Boy you're so dumb" (Yeah)
Alicia Keys with it, she ain't linking no one (She don't show emotions)
Said she love the beard, don't cut the beard, cos her ex man couldn't grow one (Ah yeah)
Miss Independent, she got her own crib (True)
Nails done, hair done, everything did (True)
Clean with the drip, she feeling the kid
Holidays, boo'd up, cos she needed a trip, yeah
Who said G's don't cuddle
Back so big that it got me seeing double
You know I love my city, but she keep me out of trouble
You the Lauren London to my Hussle
