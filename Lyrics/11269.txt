Somebody Help Me LyricsI need to see you right now
You blow me away
There's really something here

I need to hold you tight now
I want you in that way
I really think you feel the same

We spent the night in my car
You messed my hair
And I needed nothing more
Without you I am all right
I love my life today
But I love you so much more

Somebody say when the fight is over
My heart is all burned
And nothing can ease the pain
I'm falling into something I'm scared
It's all about her and I can't believe myself
I behave like little girls – it's unfair!
When will this fairytale get easy
When will this doubt disappear from my head?

I took the spoon off my cup
Like you always do
'cause it means bad luck in love

It's been the day of my life
But I'm thinking of you
I seem to miss someone

Somebody say when the fight is over
My heart is all burned
And nothing can ease the pain
I'm falling into something I'm scared
It's all about her and I can't believe myself
I behave like little girls – it's unfair!
When will this fairytale get easy
And when will this doubt disappear from my head?
Please somebody help me
Somebody help me
