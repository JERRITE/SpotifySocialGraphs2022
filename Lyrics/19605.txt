Outlaws Lyrics[Verse 1]
Run, run like the devil's behind us
Run to where no one can find us
Be my accomplice to my crime
Oh, baby
Run, run 'cause we're guilty as sin
Run 'cause we know we won't win
We know together we kill time

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never face a judge without me
You'll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away, then I'll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you
[Chorus]
We'll be outlaws (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll take on the world (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll be outlaws  (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Run, run like you never did
'Cause they found the evidence
And they found your fingerprints all on me
And, baby, run, run like your life depends on it
Let's make forever in this moment
Tell me you love me again, oh again

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would waste away without you
You're the shinin' to my star
I'd be searchin' 'til I found you
Wherever you are, you are

[Chorus]
We'll be outlaws (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Partners in crime (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll take on the world together (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll be outlaws (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You and me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
They'll never understand the honor (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Among these thieves (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

You'll never face a judge without me
You'll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away, then I'll be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time

[Chorus]
With you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, with you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
With you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, with you, oh-oh-ah (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
We'll be outlaws (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Partners in crime (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'd take on the world together (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm Bonnie you can be Clyde (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll be outlaws (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You and me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
They'll never understand the honor (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Among these thieves (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
