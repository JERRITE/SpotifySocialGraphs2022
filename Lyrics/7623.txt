This Is Us Lyrics[Verse 1: Jimmie Allen]
I used to push my luck, I used to fill my cup
Yeah, I used to be known for the dumb things
I used to chase the sun, I used to kiss and run
All-nighters turned into nothings, and I

[Refrain: Jimmie Allen]
I'm lucky every other lover got away (Got away)
I'm lucky that my heart was always hard to break (Hard to break)
I'm lucky when you came along, I had a chance to take
[Chorus: Jimmie Allen & Noah Cyrus]
'Cause it was just you and that was just me
And that was just the way that it used to be
And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was
No, it wasn't that bad, but could've been better
If only back then we'd have been together
But it was just you and that was just me
Before we found love
Now this is us

[Verse 2: Noah Cyrus]
All I really know is love ain't simple (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
It finds you all alone when you're unassembled
Yeah, when you're in pieces and you feel like you're drownin'
And you don't wanna give nobody the power
That's when it gets in the cut
And that's when it stitches you up

[Chorus: Jimmie Allen & Noah Cyrus]
'Cause it was just you and that was just me
And that was just the way that it used to be
And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was
No, it wasn't that bad, but could've been better
If only back then we'd have been together
But it was just you and that was just me
Before we found love
Now this is us

[Bridge: Jimmie Allen]
I'm lucky every other lover got away (Got away, got away)
I'm lucky that my heart was always hard to break
I'm lucky when you came along, I had a chance to take

[Chorus: Jimmie Allen & Noah Cyrus, Jimmie Allen]
'Cause it was just you (Hey) and that was just me
And that was just the way that it used to be
And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was (Oh, it wasn't that bad)
No, it wasn't that bad, but could've been better
If only back then we'd have been together (Yeah)
But it was just you (Woo) and that was just me
Before we found love
Now this is us
