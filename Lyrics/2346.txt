Emerald LyricsVerse 1:
Just like your mother
Your beautiful soul
Always cared for another's
Even on your own low
This time I'll be the one looking after you so
I'll kiss your head and say it's under control
All you gotta do is let me explore
Let me dig on your dirt girl, cause I know there is something deep down I'm right

Hook:
Cause I found a treasure, inside my lover
She knows I'll keep it forever
She knows I'll keep it forever
Verse 2:
Just like the desert flowers bloom
Your love for me never fades too soon
I've got you in my arms, my arms, my arms
Ooo-hoo ooo-hoo
I'll come to you tonight so you won't be alone
Wake up I'm next to you love, next to you
No I won't leave you, cause you're precious to me, precious to me

Hook:
Cause I found a treasure, inside my lover
She knows I'll keep it forever
She knows I'll keep it forever
Cause I found a treasure, inside my lover
She knows I'll keep it forever
She knows I'll keep it foreverYou might also like5Embed
