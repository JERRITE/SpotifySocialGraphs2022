Yeah, who says my spoon is dirty?
I don't care, when I grab the mic, I have several gold spoons
Several uncooked steaks over there make me mad
Once again, I'll chew you all up, on the night of the stars
Center of World Business (Bang, bang)
1st on the recruitment list (Clap, clap), sold out
This class is not common, enjoy this value
Bad odors with good scents are against the rules
Mic, mic, bungee
(I go) Mic, mic, bungee, bright lights, going forward
You thought I was gonna fail but I’m fine, sorry
Sorry, "Billboard", worry, "worldwide"
Sorry mom, your son's too hot
I'm being a good son in place of you
No cons in our concerts
I do it, I do it, you're a bad ratatouille
If you're jealous, sue me (sue it)
[Pre-Chorus: V, Jung Kook, Jimin, Jin]
Did you see my bag? (Where?) Did you see my bag? (Where?)
It's hella trophies and it's hella thick (Hella thick, hella thick)
What you think 'bout that? (Well) What you think 'bout that? (Well)
I bet it got my haters hella sick (Hella sick)
Come and follow me, follow me with your signs up
I'm so firin', firin', boy, your time's up
Keep on runnin' and runnin' until I catch up
How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?

[Chorus: Jung Kook, RM, SUGA, Jimin, *j-hope*]
Another trophy, my hands carry 'em
Too many that I can't even count 'em (Turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
Careful of your feet, careful of what you say
Somebody stop me, I'm boutta pop off
Too busy, you know my body ain't enough (Turn it up now)
Mic drop, mic drop
*Careful of your feet, careful of what you say*

[Instrumental Post-Chorus]

[Verse 3: RM]
Baby, watch your mouth (Mouth)
It come back around ('Round)
Once upon a time (Time)
We learnt how to fly (Fly)
Go look at your mirror, same damn clothes (Yeah)
You know how I feel, damn happy (Turn up)
How many hours do we fly? (Ooh)
I keep on dreamin' on the cloud
Yeah, I'm on the mountain, yeah, I'm on the bay (Pop)
Everyday we vibin', mic drop, bam

[Interlude: RM]
Haters gon' hate
Players gon' play
Live a life, man
Good luck
[Bridge: Jin, V, Jung Kook, Jimin]
No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don't even apologize
No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don't even apologize
Look closely, look at your pathetic self
We shoot up just like Coca-Cola
Your corneas will be so shocked
Cause we're just so cool

[Instrumental Chorus]3Embed
