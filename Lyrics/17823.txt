Top 5 Lyrics[Intro]
Grrah, grrah, grrah
(Is that you JJ?)
Be keepin' that, [?]
Bizzy, muna monster, if I walk with the thirty clip
In the face wit a thirty stick
That structure, Bloodclot

[Verse 1]
Like, look, what's a demon to a goblin
I was trappin', I was robbin'
Every villain got a problem (Facts)
Look, every hero got a Gotham
Every child need a father
Like, I was raised by the block
I was nine when my father got knocked
I was twelve when my brother got knocked
I was thirteen when I let off that shot, eliminated
I had to get on that greedy shit, I ain't forgivin' 'em (At all)
I took a plea for what? Get on your knees, I don't wanna fuck
Look, switchin' your team for what? I took a oath, I ain't switchin' up
Look, servin' these fiends for what? So I can have J's when I step in the club (Facts)
Look, now I got foreigns, I'm steppin' in Dior
Drugs in my system, I'm drinkin' my Seymour's
My body different, uh, I was the Grinch I ain't care 'bout no Christmas
Look, she wanna hit this, uh
I done fuck bitches and fucked with they friendships
Look, I'm finna slide with a big stick
No, I ain't Fivi' but I got that Big Drip
This ain't no race don't trip bitch, I took an L and then I got big lit
Uh, now I'm just tryna' get big rich, I ain't got time to beef over kid shit, uh
I took a opp off the hitlist
My niggas sliding they think that they blitzin'
Look, these niggas lie in the booth
See me in person, like who you gon' yell at?
You ain't no shooter, boy, who you gon' tell that?
If I get booked Marz know where the bail at
I was 'round crack but no I never sell that
Uh, did a flip with some coke
I told my 'migo to mail that
Like, look
I said y'all niggas play too much (Facts)
I keep it brief, up in these raps
No, I ain't sayin' too much, these niggas ain't do enough
Y'all niggas spinnin', but y'all ain't even spinnin' on niggas that's ain't even tough
[?] been fiendin' to dump
Had that pussy boy bleedin' that time of the month
My shooters been on a hunt
When we slide they ain't Ricky, they like Forrest Gump (Facts)
I asked if you ready or not
If I see a opp, don't think it's sweet 'cause you know it's baby bottlepop
When it comes to these bars I'm really elite
Bitch, I'm the one who made it hot
Like, look (Bitch, I'm the one who made it hot)
I was spinin' on any block
I'm off the 'Tron I said I don't do Ciroc
From the east where they cook up
But I be in the 'Stuy where the real niggas Milly Rock
And my shooter just hit me like, good luck
You know it get spooky up at the top
'Cause that's when you see who hatin'
They ain't gon' love you when you leave the block
Like nah ma', always on go I ain't care 'bout no stop signs
Top 5
Uh, come to that drill and they know I'm top 5
On the dead guys
Uh, niggas say different then he get his head fried
You a damn lie

[Outro]
Like, uh, we really spinnin' for real
Uh, they makin' up drills when we really makin' movies for real

You mention Brooklyn you know that I'm top 5
On the dead guys
Like, he talking hot then he get his head fried
You a damn lie, uh
