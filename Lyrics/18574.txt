Everything Must Go Lyrics[Verse 1]

You cannot fight fire with fire
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind and
We are all slaves of desire
Controlled by the things we think that we need
No, not trying to preach to the choir
Cause I’m just a girl born unto this world but
I am no god or messiah
But here’s what I know
[Hook x2]

Everything must go
Like everything you know, forget about it
Everything must go
Like everything you think you know

[Verse 2]

After the fire
We each have one sweatsuit and one pair of shoes
No, nothing designer
But smile anyway cause my mama said that happiness comes from within so
What you create for you, no one can take from you
Your energy and your soul
Is all that goes, wherever we go

[Hook/Outro]

Everything else don’t
Like everything you own, forget about it
Everything must go
Like everything you think you know
Everything must go
Like everything you know, forget about it
Everything must go
Like everything you think you know
You might also likeCan’t take it with you when we go
Tell everybody that you know
That everything yeah, everything must go

Everything must go
Like everything you know
Everything must go
Like everything, like everything you know

Everything must go
Tell everybody that you know18Embed
