Ride Tonight Lyrics[Chorus]
Got shot at, they didn't hit me so it's on sight (on sight)
Yeah, we gon' load up the choppas, we gon' ride tonight (rah)
I always gotta keep it tucked, can't let them take my life (my life)
Them niggas shot me and they missed so they gon' die tonight (die tonight)
Got shot at, they didn't hit me so it's on sight (sight)
Yeah, we gon' load up the choppas, we gon' ride tonight (boom)
I always gotta keep it tucked, can't let them take my life (my life)
Them niggas shot me and they missed so they gon' die tonight (die tonight)

[Verse]
I came from the trenches, I came from the slumps (slumps)
Where if you go around the corner, you can get a gun (gun)
Drug dealing, killing niggas, but they call this fun (fun)
That's why I gotta watch my back, cuz I don't trust none (none)
When the money goin', you find out who your niggas is (niggas is)
Niggas quick to change on you for them dividends (dividends)
I'm up next, so I'm hated by many men (man)
I'ma make it like I turned into a Christian man (Christian)
Stacking up my paper, get it for the fam now (fam now)
All gas, I ain't asking for no handouts (handouts)
Niggas always tryna join after they left out (left out)
Left out, up in that downfall so you banned now (banned now)
You reapply pressure like a metal lever (metal level)
More money, more problems, but Ima stay real clever (clever nigga)
Ima focus on that road to make my life better (better nigga)
Switching on my bros, pussy nigga that will be never (nigga)
[Chorus]
Got shot at, they didn't hit me so it's on sight (on sight)
Yeah, we gon' load up the choppas, we gon' ride tonight (rah)
I always gotta keep it tucked, can't let them take my life (my life)
Them niggas shot me and they missed so they gon' die tonight (die tonight)
Got shot at, they didn't hit me so it's on sight (sight)
Yeah, we gon' load up the choppas, we gon' ride tonight (boom)
I always gotta keep it tucked, can't let them take my life (my life)
Them niggas shot me and they missed so they gon' die tonight (die tonight)

[Outro]
Take my life
Ain't let a nigga take my life, nigga
Never that
