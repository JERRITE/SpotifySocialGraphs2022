Where U Going? LyricsWhere you going?
Is it heaven or hell?
Are you still under the spell?
Guess only time will tell
I got one life
I was lost in abyss
'til God rained down on me
And put the knife in my fist
To cut ties with my demons
Lonely nights been dismissed
I'm never looking back now
Cause my life been a bliss
I used to wanna die
Thoughts of suicide was routine
Thought i was living my dreams
But now my conscious is clean
Its like everything i was ever taught was a lie
But if you look to the sky
Promise the pain will subside
Its just the fantasy we all living
Its God given
Take the blessing cause we all sinning
We not winning
Where you going?
Is it heaven or hell?You might also like1Embed
