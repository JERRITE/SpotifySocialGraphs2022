Brother My Brother LyricsBrother, my brother
Tell me what are we fighting for?
We've got to end this war
We should love one another
Oh can't we just pretend
This war never began?
We can try, brother, my brother

We face each other from different sides
The anger burns, can't remember why
It's kinda crazy to cause such pain
Our foolish pride makes us hate this way
We watch our world fall apart
Tell me what good is winning
When we lose our heart?

Brother My Brother
Tell me what are we fighting for
Isn't life worth so much more?
We should love one another
Oh can't we just pretend
This war never began?
Tell me why, brother my brother

We can try, brother my brother

Let's take a moment and look deep inside
And say we're willing to give love a try!
We're not as different as we seem to be
There's so much more to me then what you see

Don't have to be this way!
Think about the consequences
Turn around and walk away!

Brother My Brother
Tell me what are we fighting for
Isn't life worth so much more?
We should love one another
Oh can't we just pretend
This war never began?
Tell me why, brother my brother
