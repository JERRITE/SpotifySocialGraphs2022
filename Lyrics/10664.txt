Oh Shhh Lyrics[Intro]
La (Da, da-da-da)
La-da-da-da (Da, da-da-da)
Do-do-do-do
Do-do (Dream), oh shit

[Chorus]
Pull up to the club just because (Oh shit)
All my girls' nails did and hair done (Oh shit)
I drag a chick out the club just for fun (Oh shit)
I thought you knew that you got the right one (Oh shit)
With my girls, they my ride or dies (Oh shit)
We turning up on the IG Live (Oh shit)
Get it back, put the fellas to the side (Oh shit)
I'm a hustler so I always maximize (Oh shit)
[Verse]
Turn your boo to my trick, give me what I need, uh (Uh)
Buy me what I want, but I never need ya (No)
I will never tell, better if I show ya (Woo)
Built an empire, we hit the quota
This the finale, but it ain't over
Wear my heart on my wrist, ice cold, polar
A fеw pulling copycats, it's a repeat (Uh)
Buy the wholе bar, here's the receipt, ayy
Ho, ho, ho, it's a freak-nique
Women wit' attitude like Eazy-E (Woo)
Ayy, coffin style nails got 'em six deep
Swiping cards for that Fendi and that CC, ayy

[Chorus]
Pull up to the club just because (Oh shit)
All my girls' nails did and hair done (Oh shit)
I drag a chick out the club just for fun (Oh shit)
I thought you knew that you got the right one (Oh shit)
With my girls, they my ride or dies (Oh shit)
We turning up on the IG Live (Oh shit)
Get it back, put the fellas to the side (Oh shit)
I'm a hustler so I always maximize (Oh shit)You might also likeEmbed
