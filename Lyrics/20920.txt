Donâ€™t Want to Live Without It LyricsI remember how you caught my eye
The first time you smiled at me
Something kind of happened from the very start
Just like it was meant to be

Your love has taken hold of me
And now I've just got to let you know

Don't want to live without it
Now that I've found your love
There ain't no doubt about it
You are the one I love
Sometimes it seems like magic
When two people come together
I can't believe what you done for me
Our love keeps getting better

I feel like I've been born again
And I know that the best is yet to come

Don't want to live without it
Now that I've found your love
There ain't no doubt about it, no
You are the one I love, oh

Don't want to live without it
(No I don't)
Now that I've found your love
(Now that I've found your love)

There ain't no doubt about it
(Ain't no doubt about it)
You are the one I love
(The one I love)

Don't want to live without it
(No, baby)
Now that I've found your love
(Now that I've found it for sure)
There ain't no doubt about it
(There ain't no doubt about it)
You are the one I love
(You are the one, you are the one)
You might also likeDon't want to live without you
Now that I've found your love
There ain't no doubt
(Ain't no doubt about it, baby)
You are the one I love
(You are the one)

Don't want to live without it
(No)
Don't want to live without it
(Don't want to live without your love)

Don't want to live without it
(Oh)
Don't want to live without it
(Oh, yes about you)

Don't want to live without it
(No I don't, oh no)
Don't want to live without it
(Oh)
Don't want to live without itEmbed
