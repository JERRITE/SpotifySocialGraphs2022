Balenciaga Pt7 Lyrics[Verse 1: UNOFROMPLUTO]
We just hit em up he got robbed
And you ain't safe if you be walkin around inside
Fuck yo bitch and she gone scream "oh my god"
Bitch I put this shit on squad
Tone up that .30 and I'm countin up my guap
Bitch I got that heat and so he boutta get rocked
And if he got a lick then we gone hit him where we slide
Spend 400 on my feet so it's like I'm steppin on ice
Bad bitch from the hills and she gone slide through
We just hit him up he had no clue
All black pull up through the drive thru
We was right there beside you
Yeah wе geekin uh uh
Bitch we eatin uh uh
I might feed yo bitch
Swallow my semеn uh
That hoe gonna swallow
These tips they be hollow
I sip at the bottle
You can't see him tomorrow
He just got lost in it
I be saucin it
He be opp in it
Whole gang gang offin it
Now you be crossin it
We do walk ups
We do drive bys if he tryna talk tough

I be posted in the night time like an owl
Whole gang on the block [?]
