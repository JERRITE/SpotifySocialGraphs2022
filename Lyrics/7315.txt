Move Your Feet / D.A.N.C.E. / It’s a Sunshine Day Lyrics[Intro]
Everybody, move your hair and feel united, oh
Everybody, shake your hair and feel united, oh

Everybody’s comin' to the celebration
I'mma hook you up with the invitation
Let your hair swing and party with me
No bad vibes, just love you’ll see

Do the D.A.N.C.E
1, 2, 3, 4, fight
Stick to the b.e.a.t
Get ready to ignite
You are such a P.Y.T., catching all the lights
Just as easy as ABC, that’s how you make it right

Aw, it ain't hard out here, when you’re doing it right
Put a smile on blast, that's the troll life

And I’m here to help you through it
Come on, Smidge, I know you can do it!

Your confidence gives me strength!

Everybody, shake your hair and feel united, oh
Sunshine day
Everybody’s laughing
Sunshine day
Everybody’s singing

Don’t stop, don’t stop the beat
I can’t stop, i can’t stop the beat
I won’t stop, won’t stop the beat
Go!

Everybody, shake your hair and feel united, oh woah
Sunshine day
Everybody’s laughing
Sunshine day
Everybody’s singing
You might also like[Outro]
Sunshine day
Everybody, move your hair and feel united, oh woah
Oh yeah! oh!
Yeah!Embed
