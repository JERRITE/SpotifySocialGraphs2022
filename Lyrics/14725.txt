â€‹welcome to me Lyrics[Intro]
Uhh, mhm
To be honest
Uh
I've been avoiding
Like, pretty much everybody
Living online, I don't know
Just making music
(Welcome)

[Verse]
Somebody stop my fucking head
(Somebody stop my fucking head, yeah)
(Somebody stop my fucking head)
Somebody stop my fucking head, from hurting me
(From motherfucking hurting me)
Stop, stop my head (Yeah, yeah, somebody stop my fucking head)
Somebody stop my fucking head, from hurting me
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(From motherfucking hurting me)
Ashes on the walls (Ah, yeah)
(Stop my fucking head, stop my fucking head)
I'm blowing fucking smoke into the exhaust fan in the washroom
(Into the exhaust fan)
I'm not dead (I'm not fucking dead, fuck)
I'm not dead, but sometimes I want to be
(I'm not fucking dead, yeah)
(I'm not fucking dead, yeah)
(Somebody stop my fucking head, yeah)
(I'm not fucking dead)
(Yeah)
Somebody stop my fucking head
(Stop my fucking head)
(Yeah)
(Ay, yeah)
Somebody stop my fucking head
Somebody stop my fucking head
(Stop my fucking head)You might also like1Embed
