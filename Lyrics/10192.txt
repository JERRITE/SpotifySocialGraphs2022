London Is Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
I started feeling like I'm living in the Upside Down
Haven't seen you in forever and I don't know how
And I've been smoking and staying out too late
But you know I've got good intentions, babe

[Verse 2]
Started feeling like I see you in the rush hour crowd
When I catch you and a stranger in the Underground
But something's missing, I've got an empty space
And something's different, when you leave my place
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us

[Chorus]
And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's getting harder and hardеr to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
Cause I'm— Oh, so sick of this placе
Feeling way too big and nothing can hold me—
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely without you

[Verse 3]
Any minute now, I swear I'm gonna lose my mind
So many people, it's so easy to get lost sometimes
And this winter is going on too long
Though it don't snow here
It stays pretty cold and I miss your warmth

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up (Call you up)
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us
You might also like[Chorus]
And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's getting harder and harder to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
'Cause I'm— Oh, so sick of this place
Feeling way too big and nothing can hold me—
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely

[Post-Chorus]
I'm lonely without you
I'm lonely without you
God, I'm lonely without you

[Chorus]
And it's all good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's getting harder and harder to reach you
London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
'Cause I'm— Oh, so sick of this place
Feeling way too big and nothing can hold me—
Can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely
[Post-Chorus]
I'm lonely without you (I'm lonely without you)
I'm lonely without you (So lonely without you)
God, I'm lonely without you (So lonely without you)

[Outro]
London is lonely, so lonely
I'm lonely without you (Mmm-mmh)
God, I'm lonely without you
Without you, mmm-mmh2Embed
