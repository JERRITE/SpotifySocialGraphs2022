Too Much Fun LyricsHey yo lets go to my place and we can be best friends
"Yeah?"
I wouldn't lie mate
I'll bake, we'll play games and watch films too
And I positively definitely won't kill you
"What?!" Nothing
Take a seat by the TV with these dudes
Here and see to it
That your eyes don't leave the screen soon
"Oh my God they were knifed to death, it's-"
No, no, it's just ketchup and they're narcoleptic

Hey yo, let's go to the traitor tester
Step into the booth "-And press the green to check?" Yeah
I'll go last and see the whole thing through
And I positively definitely won't kill you
Just a second
"Oh my God is that C4 that you've got"
No, no, no, it's just my new watch
Here try it on, it suits you more anyway
"But it's counting down" That's why I'm running away



I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun

I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun



Hey yo, let's go for a garden stroll
Leave your worries behind and your guard down low
No need for threes, we can go in twos
And I positively definitely won't kill you
I'll be nice this time
Who am I kidding I'm addicted, dude
"Guys! I'm with the-" Click click boom "Traitor"
It wasn't me, it was him! "That's a Snail"
Yeah a snail with a devious grin
You might also like

Hey yo, let's go to this open cliff and
Stand right here in this position "This seems suspicious"
Hey yo, chill, dude, cause I positively definitely won't kill you
Oh, no! She jumped off! Oh well let's go
"Did you poke her off?" What? No way, bro!
"You knifed me in the back!" This is not what I want
"Then stop stabbing me, man" Yeah but I can't stop



I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun

I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun




I-I wanna be nice I-I wanna be nice But I never been found out, never been found I cause all of the trouble in terrorist town
But I never been found out, never been found
Cause all of the trouble in terrorist t
I cause all of the trouble in terrorist town
But I never been found out, never been found
Cause all of the trouble in terrorist t


I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun

I wanna be nice, I wanna be nice
I really do but betraying you is just too much fun "So much"
It's just too much fun1Embed
