Cherry Vimto Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't you know how hard
Don't you know how hard I've tried to leave you behind?
But there's a new story everytime I look in your eyes
And that's hard to find
I hope that you'd like
To stay with me tonight

[Verse 2]
If you're out for the night
Baby that's alright
Won't put up a fight
Just know that I would like you to be mine
Don't you think that'd be nice?
I hope that you'd like
[Chorus]
To stay with me
You're bittersweet
Or something in-between
Stay with me

[Verse 3]
Won't you stay for the night?
You know that I like to bide my time
Maybe we could try
I think that we might
Be something you'd like
I hope that you'd like

[Chorus]
To stay with me
You're bittersweet
Or something in-between
Stay with me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Don't you know how hard
Don't you know how hard I've tried to leave you behind?
But there's a new story everytime I look in your eyes
And that's hard to find
I hope that you'd like
You might also like[Chorus x2]
To stay with me
You're bittersweet
Or something in-between
Stay with me2Embed
