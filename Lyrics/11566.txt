Maybe You’re the Reason Lyrics[Intro]
Now tell me something
Is there a point to this?
Or are we living for the feeling
When we look back
On what we did and reminisce?

[Verse 1]
'Cause I’ve looked within and I've read
But instead I keep focusing
On just how thin I can get
Now I'm looking for something else
I found myself: I’m someone else
[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you're the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)

[Verse 2]
And I think I'm dying
'Cause this can't be living
Should I be searching for
Some kind of meaning?
Apathy’s a funny feeling

[Bridge]
I turned my gaze to the ceiling
Thanked a God I don’t believe in
For the scene outside
I tried my best at sleeping but
My dreams were unappealing
So I searched for people in the landscape
Passers by

[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you’re the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I keep looking for something
Even though I know that it's not there
(Maybe you’re the reason)
Every time I try to figure it out
You're the only thing I can think about
(Maybe you're the reason)7Embed
