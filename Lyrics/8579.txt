Driven by You Lyrics[Intro]
Oooh
Everything I do I do for you

Oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
We touch and you're afraid of me
And we burn and now I'm at your feet
High speed, but you know you're in safe hands
[Verse 2]
In the dark we make a brighter light
From one spark to the horizon wide
We trust, and together we tame the land, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Oooh, you'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true, yeah
Everything I do is driven by you!

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Come on, babe

[Verse 3]
Oh, well, it's tough
To make a journey through, the right stuff
Is dead ahead of you and me
And you know we've still got time

[Verse 4]
Hold on tight to the driving wheel
This ride is really out of line
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime

[Chorus 2]
You know I love you but you drive me crazy
'Cause you're saying all the things I want to say to you
You say
Everything I do is driven by you
You might also like[Hook]
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do is driven by you

[Bridge]
Inner children lost their way
Now they know the price you pay
I'm holding on to life with you
'Cause life without you just won't do

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude{]
Driven by you

[Chorus 3]
You know we're never gonna know who's dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true, yeah
Everything I do is driven by you

[Hook]
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do, everything we do
Everything we do is driven by
Driven by
Driven by you

[Outro]
Oooh, everything I do
I do for youEmbed
