My Shitâ€™s Fucked Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I went to the doctor
I said, "I'm feeling kind of rough"
"Let me break it to you, son
Your shit's fucked up"
I said, "My shit's fucked up?
Well, I don't see how."
He said, "The shit that used to work
It won't work now"

[Verse 2]
I had a dream
Ah, shucks, oh, well
Now it's all fucked up
It's shot to hell
Yeah, yeah, my shit's fucked up
It has to happen to the best of us
The rich folks suffer like the rest of us
It'll happen to you
[Verse 3]
That amazing grace
Sort of passed you by
You wake up every day
And you start to cry
Yeah, you want to die
But you just can't quit
Let me break it on down
It's the fucked up shit

[Outro]
Yeah, my shit's fucked up
Fucked upYou might also like2Embed
