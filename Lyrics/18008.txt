â€‹all i need (the distance song) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I could remember what it feels like
To touch your skin
And what your voice sounds like in person
I know Facetime can distort it and I miss it
I wish I'd fall asleep with you
But I just wear the clothes you left
And I hope just for a second
I could have you without knowing
That you're leaving
[Chorus]
And I'm sick of kissing you in my head
Oh baby, tell me, when can it be real instead?
'Cause I would do anything to be close to you again
And it's hard being here half empty
When somewhere different is my favorite part of me
If I could just hold you for real
That's the only thing I'll need
Baby, that's all I need
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
All I need

[Verse 2]
I know I'm more than lucky just to have you if you're here or not
But it's hard to comprehend the amount that I would give to have you in my arms, just in my arms

[Chorus]
And I'm sick of kissing you in my head
Oh baby, tell me, when can it be real instead?
'Cause I would do anything to be close to you again
And it's hard being here half empty
When somewhere different is my favorite part of me
If I could just hold you for real
That's the only thing I'll need
Baby, that's all I need (Ooh)
That's all I need
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All I need
You might also like[Outro]
I'm so sick of kissing you in my head
And I'm scared that I'm starting to forget
What it feels like to have you right here with me
To not wish days away, I know that's bad for me
And it's hard being here half empty
When somewhere different is my favorite part of me
If I could just hold you for real
That's the only thing I'll need
Baby, that's all I need (ooh)
That's all I need (ooh)
Baby, that's all I need (ooh, ooh)
Baby, that's all I need3Embed
