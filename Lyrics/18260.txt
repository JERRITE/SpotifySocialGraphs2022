Stories of a Ghetto Kitty Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch
Bitch

[Chorus]
Last night i was chillin in the VIP
Bitches in my section, but they claiming they don’t fuck with me
I was in my own vibe on that ecstasy, cameras flashin all in my face fuckin my energy
Running back, giants playa trynna get with me
Left his ass on read now i got this nigga sweatin me
Why these same lame bitches from the VIP
Try to run down on me
I had to put they ass to sleep
[Bridge 1]
I don’t give a fuck bout you hatin' ass hoes
Bitches always wanna pop shit on the 'gram
Poppin' that shit on fuckin line
Bitch actually run up in fucking person bitch
You scary ass hoe!

[Verse 2]
Stupid bitch, get yo nigga back
Fucked em with no strings attached
Treat em like Pinocchio and had that nigga runnin back
As a matter fact, you can’t get yo nigga back
Curving all yo calls while his face inside this kitty cat
I cannot be caught up with you lame bitches, hating bitches, same bitches fucking on the same nigga
I don’t give a fuck about a hating hoe, a basic hoe, a fakin hoe, i fuck around and raised a hoe

[Bridge 2]
