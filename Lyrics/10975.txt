Why Does It Hurt Lyrics[Verse 1]
3 AM, I was lying awake and I saw your eyes catch mine
But you kept on pretending that you were asleep
And I knew it was over
You held my hand a little less convincingly for the rest of the night
And in the morning you were acting fuckin' distant
And I knew it was over

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's for the best
But it don't hurt any less
[Chorus]
Baby tonight, you lost what you don't deserve
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?
I would be fine if I got to end it first
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt?

[Verse 2]
Truth is I had this feeling inside
Telling me you weren't the one for me the whole damn time
But I didn't leave 'til you said it was over
'Cause I didn't wanna be one of those people who just moves on
To the next best thing when the next best thing comes along
'Til you said it was over

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's for the best
But it don't hurt any less

[Chorus]
Baby tonight, you lost what you don't deserve
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?
I would be fine if I got to end it first
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt?

Ego and power and control
Making me captive in their hold
I would be fine if I let go
Let go, let go
Ego and power and control
Making me captive in their hold
I would be better without you
So tell me why I'm hurt

[Chorus]
Baby tonight, you lost what you don't deserve
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt? (No)
I would be fine if I got to end it first
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?
So somebody tell me
Why does it hurt?

[Outro]
(Why does it hurt, why does it hurt?)Embed
