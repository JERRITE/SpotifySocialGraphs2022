Hostage of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
You make yourself a prisoner of me
You blind yourself so you don't have to see
You turn your life to a power above
You make yourself a hostage of love

You turn from me, you turn from the strain
Devote yourself to the power again
Distance yourself from all that we avowed
You broke those rules, you're my hostage now
I am a sinner
And I am a saint
I am a devil
I am a ghost at the wake
I feed the swell and pull
Of your tears as they break
I am the limit of
The load you can take

You are the pulley
And I am the winch
I am salvation
And your herald of sin
I take you beyond
Your limits of trust
Ransom yourself
Hostage of love

[Chorus 1]
You see you have been born again
Since you slept there in that liar's den, then
You cannot be saved
You gave your innocence away

[Verse 2]
I've turned my cheek
And I've suffered the blow
Truth of my story
Is widely unknown
Words of derision I have
Swallowed with a smile
For telling my story
I have been crucified
You might also likeNow like a madman
I give my laurels to you
Like a hero
Forsake my trophies for you
Though a deciple of this devil
That is in our blood
Am I not also
Your hostage of love?

[Chorus 2]
You see you have been born again
Since you slept there in that liar's den, then
You cannot return
Until your innocence is earned

And you see you've got to live alone
Though it hurts, You'll make it on your own
You cannot be saved
You gave your innocence away

You will remain a hostage of loveEmbed
