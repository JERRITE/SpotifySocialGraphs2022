Something Real (Inside Me/Inside You) LyricsEveryone's looking for something real
Everyone's taking all they can steal
Brother to sister
Look at each other
Face to face
There's something missing here in this human race, hey
Inside me
(All we want is something real)
Is a part of you
(We can make this last forever)
And I know inside you
(Make a world where we can feel)
Is a part of me
(We will always be together)
Yeah

Person to person
Place to place
We run from each other
Lost in the race
Brother to sister
Hold on to each other with all we got
Our time is coming if you're ready or not
If you're ready or not, oh

Gimme something real
(All we want is something real)
Gimme something real
(We can make this last forever)
Inside you
(Make a world where we can feel)
Is a part of me
(We will always be together)
Yeah, yeah

Brother to sister
Hold on to each other with all we got
Our time is coming, oh
If you're ready or not
If you're ready or not, oh
