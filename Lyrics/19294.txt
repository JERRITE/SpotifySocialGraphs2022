Hollywood Hillbilly Lyrics[Verse 1]
City full of demons dressed as angels get me out
The perfect weather’s fine with me
But everything else ain’t what it seems
Carbon copy, rinse repeat, do anything for clout
This shit is like highschool TBH
And everybody here looks the same

[Pre Hook]
No I won’t dress up for your party
I’m too drunk for pilates
Crooked teeth stained from coffee
I chain smoke while the whip is chargin’
Fine dine at olive garden
Sweaty tank top from target
[Hook]
I’m just a Hollywood hillbilly
I’m just a Hollywood hillbilly

[Verse 2]
If I change up and lose my soul
Take that thing, aim it at my skull
‘Cause my best friend turned into an asshole
I guess tonight I’m grilling up alone
And I’m in the Caddy but it’s never clean
Got a cold Bud Light miss me with the Hennessy, yeah
I ain’t buyin’ half of the shit you sellin’ me, yeah

[Pre Hook]
No I won’t dress up for your party
I’m too drunk for pilates
Crooked teeth stained from coffee
I chain smoke while the whip is chargin’
Fine dine at olive garden
Sweaty tank top from target

[Hook]
I’m just a Hollywood hillbilly
I’m just a Hollywood hillbilly

[Post Hook]
No I won’t dress up for your party
I’m too drunk for pilates
Crooked teeth stained from coffee
I chain smoke while the whip is chargin’
Fine dine at olive garden
Sweaty tank top from targetYou might also likeEmbed
