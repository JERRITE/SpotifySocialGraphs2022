Lazy Bones Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm too tired to be bored, I'm too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening, it's like picking at a sore
I'm too mental to go crazy, I'm too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me, and I can't sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired
I can't take it anymore (Whoa-oh)
Out with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war (Whoa-oh)
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't wanna hear it anymore

[Verse 2]
It's good to see you, but I really must admit
There's an odor in the air, and I think you look like shit
I can't stand from falling down, I'm too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking, and they can't shut the fuck up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired
I can't take it anymore (Whoa-oh)
Out with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war (Whoa-oh)

[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't wanna hear it anymore

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh!

[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't wanna hear about it
I don't wanna scream about it
I don't wanna hear it anymore10Embed
