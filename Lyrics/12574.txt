Cannonballers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pulled behind a car with one hundred different bumper stickers on
In the left lane, crawling 58 on the freeway
Ears a ringing keychain, pressure in the blood
Can't slow down, I'm a time bomb ticking while I run
With a loaded gun staring at the sun
Got a blind eye, never hit the bullseye
Just like acting tough

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep asking myself
"Hey, why are you running?"
[Chorus]
Hardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers
Heard the whistle blow fom the Wabash
Can't borrow time with the cold cash
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (With the cold cash)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
Television preacher, got yourself another seeker on the line
Could you make the time? I could use divine intervention
Undivided attention, someone needs to know
Yeah, I cooked the books and threw my combinations
Dodging jabs and hooks with shallow conversations
Like a surface level, speed sick devil on the loose

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep asking myself
"Hey, why are you running?"

[Chorus]
Hardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers
Heard the whistle blow fom the Wabash
Can't borrow time with the cold cash
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (With the cold cash)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (But I keep on running)
Hardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers
Heard the whistle blow fom the Wabash
Can't borrow time with the cold cash
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Can't borrow time with the cold cash)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

And I keep asking myself
"Hey, what are you running from?"
Don't know why I keep runningEmbed
