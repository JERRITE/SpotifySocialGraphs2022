Fine Wine Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Kojo Funds, Yxng Bane]
Said she wanna take me away, ayy
Said she wanna take me away, ayy
Said she wanna show me the way, ayy
Baby don't play no games, but to please me

[Chorus: Yxng Bane]
Take time, take time
Slow wine, slow wine
Take time, take time
Slow wine, slow wine
[Verse 1: Yxng Bane, Kojo Funds]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
There to the destination
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
There to the destination, yeah yeah
Take the lead we can go anywhere that you plead
She says to me take the lead
And when she's coming only coming for me

[Verse 2: Kojo Funds Yxng Bane]
She said want feel me
She said she wants my babies come feel me, yeah yeah
She said it won't kill me
Baby give it to me don't tease me, yeah yeah

And wear my body, handle me as plead
She says to me take the lead
Now watch the white wine drip on her knee
