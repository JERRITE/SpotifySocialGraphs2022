Way 2 High (demo) Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
I get way too high (Yeah)
It's by design, I'm
Layed up, long sleepless nights
Those summer nights
Those summer nights
We would spark up outside
Now it's upside down
None of this shh feels right
[Verse 1]
You called me late
Promised I wouldn't pick it up past 9, but
I had a really long day
So I'll probably pick it up this time
Look what we started, yeah (Yeah)
It's not coincidental, baby
I think we'd be special, baby, aww, yeah (Yeah)
But I won't ever learn my lesson
Let me light one up, forget it, maybe I, yeah

[Chorus]
I get way too high (Yeah)
It's by design, I'm
Layed up, long sleepless nights
Those summer nights
Those summer nights
We would spark up outside
Now it's upside down
None of this shh feels right

[Verse 2]
I get way too caught up when she lit tomorrow
I think you're probably thinkin' 'bout him while I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Said, said while I'm thinkin' 'bout you (‘Bout you, thinkin’ 'bout you)
I'm feeling lost, can I spend the night? Yeah
Pillow talks turn into pillow fights
We try and try again, but I don't think we'll ever get it right
Wait, I got so much baggage, think I missed my flight
I'll see you in a different life
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm feeling lost, can I spend the night?
Pillow talks turn into pillow fights
I don't think we'll ever get it right
Got so much baggage, think I missed my flight
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I get way too high (Yeah)
It's by design, I'm
Layed up, long sleepless nights
Those summer nights
Those summer nights
We would spark up outside
Now it's upside down
None of this shh feels right1Embed
