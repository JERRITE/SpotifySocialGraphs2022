Holy F4k Lyrics[Chorus: Black Sherif]
Oh holy fuck
Coal tar so na menam wofrɛ me aa wonnya yi I've been chasing guap
Zongo mafia straight from aseɛ hɔ baabi nam ha de trap
Mabɛhyia killer boys yɛ rollie trees na yɛɛtwe puff, puff, puff and pass oo ade wei i no fit stop
Coal tar so na menam wofrɛ me aa wonnya yi I've been chasing guap
Zongo mafia straight from aseɛ hɔ baabi nam ha de trap
Mabɛhyia killer boys yɛ rollie trees na yɛɛtwe puff, puff, puff and pass oo ade wei i no fit stop


[Verse 1: Ivorian Doll]
Said I won't win but I already won
Said I couldn't ever make hits well bitch that shits already been done
Know they saw rumours bang like a gun
Bodied these bitches I've only begun
So all of this talking I'm not having none
Been on my grind, one of a kind, you'll find that I can never be redone
Check the checks I been bossin'
All the sauce I been flossin'
All these racks they ain't stoppin'
See the stats I been poppin'
Lit as fuck I been vossin'
All your head top i'm offin'
Light work I been joggin'
Night bird I been flockin'
Wise words I been droppin'
So cold no defrostin'
[Chorus: Black Sherif]
Oh holy fuck
Coal tar so na menam wofrɛ me aa wonnya yi I've been chasing guap
Zongo mafia straight from aseɛ hɔ baabi nam ha de trap
Mabɛhyia killer boys yɛ rollie trees na yɛɛtwe puff, puff, puff and pass oo ade wei i no fit stop
Coal tar so na menam wofrɛ me aa wonnya yi I've been chasing guap
Zongo mafia straight from aseɛ hɔ baabi nam ha de trap
Mabɛhyia killer boys yɛ rollie trees na yɛɛtwe puff, puff, puff and pass oo ade wei i no fit stop

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Chasing guap but I don't use Chase
Stuff big knots in the Rick like James
Bad boy shit but i don't know Mase
FTY Boyz long live shace
Koftown, Zongo, streets them slums
Still in the Raq like he Saddam
No Djembes we play with them drums
Play with B's you may get stung
Young (throw it up!)
I'm with the members they twisting they fingers
We want the cream talking 36 Chambers
30 on me so I'm armed and I'm dangerous
Shoutout the Kumericans
I fuck with Smallgod but we do this shit big
I'm still alive so the tat on my stomach is true till I'm dead
They know what it is
