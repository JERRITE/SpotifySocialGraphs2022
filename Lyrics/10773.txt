WIZZ (COBRAH REMIX) LyricsCOBRAH
COUCOU CHLOE

I should get high, not the first time
And let it go, let it go, let it go
Listen, I was high, not your last time
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
I should get high
I should be riding
Should be hard and soft inside me
Squeeze it, hold it baby, bite me
I'm too good to be beside you
I should wait and find a wifey
A good dom with deluxe duplex
I should fuck less and have more sex
But I likе to keep life complex
Yeah, I'm lеtting go
I don't care anymore
I feel good, I'm so good, I look really good
Gotta get more of the max
Get me more relaxed
(I'm so) High but underground merging with the world around

I should get high, not the first time
And let it go, let it go, let it go
Listen, I was high, not your last time
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
You might also likeBabe, you wanna spend the night, right?
Wanna be me and be mine, right?
Gotta get high, get off life, why?
I get high for one last time, right?

I should get high, not the first time
And let it go, let it go, let it go
Listen, I was high, not your last time
Let it go, let it go, let it go

Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
