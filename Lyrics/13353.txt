Youâ€™re So Cool LyricsBody so fit, so full of spark
With affirmations as your wall art
You were driven, eyes on the prize
A yoga routine, home exercise
Now like the faded star
In Sunset Boulevard
I play the devoted butler
Morning coffees by the bed
While all hard fought endeavours
Bring in diminished returns
You're so cool, it's true
You're my kind of girl
Keep you 'til the end
Find solace in the privilege to pursue
Most people are crushed into servitudeYou might also like9Embed
