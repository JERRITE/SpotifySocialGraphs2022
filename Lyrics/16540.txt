Itâ€™s Raining Men (Single Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Hi! Hi! We're your weather girls
(Uh huh)
And have we got news for you!
You better listen
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)
According to all sources (What sources now?)
The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men
[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

[Verse 1]
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low (its getting low low low)
According to all sources, the street's the place to go (According to all sources)
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten (half-past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (start raining men)
