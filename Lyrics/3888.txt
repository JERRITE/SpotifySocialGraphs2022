Moonshot Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember when we were
Suiting up again
Before the end of time
We were living in a dream that
Never seemed to cease
Never asking why

[Pre Chorus]
Over and over again
We took so much for granted
Still we refuse to give in
To the fate we've been handed
[Chorus]
And though it's a moonshot
We can't stop
Until we get back to this star
If it's the last chance
Then take my hand
If there's a miracle left in your heart
It can't be that far

[Verse 2]
There is joy beyond your tears
Take comfort, I am here
Let me show the way
There's no purpose, there's no plan
But I don't care or give a damn
As long as you're okay

[Pre Chorus]
Over and over again
We took so much for granted
But still I refuse to give in
To the fate we've been handed

[Chorus]
And though it's a moonshot
We can't stop
Until we get back to this star
If it's the last chance
Then take my hand
If there's a miracle left to be found
It's a matter of time
Just a matter of time

I remember when we were
Suiting up again
Before the end of time
Living in a dream that
Never seemed to cease
Never asking why

[Chorus]
And though it's a moonshot
We can't stop
Until we get back to this star
If there's a last chance
Well then take my hand
If there's a miracle left in your heart
Let it be found
Just let it be found

If it's a last chance
Well then take my hand
If there's a miracle left to be found
It's a matter of time
Just a matter of time
Just a matter of timeEmbed
