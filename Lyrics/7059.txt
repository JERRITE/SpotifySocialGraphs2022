Closer to u Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your skins got me fallin
Got me fallin under
Yeah
Your skins got me fallin under
I feel so connected when we sin
I know that there's danger in the wonder
But I love the affection of the feel


[Chorus]
I won't apologize to your momma
For fucking you right
(you right)
Suck you dry
Then I look her straight in the eye
If this love's a fire
Baby burn me
I've been getting higher
On your body
If this love's an ocean
Baby drown me
I just wanna feel a little closer
Closer to you
A little closer to you
Feel a little cl-closer
A little closer to you
Feel a little cl-closer
[Verse 2]
Heaven knows the way I think about you is a sin
But I can't stop my pretty little head from rotating
Heaven help me god im in too deep
Take me to the higher ground
Cause I can barely breathe

[Chorus]
I won't apologize to your momma
For fucking you right
(you right)
Suck you dry
Then I look her straight in the eye
If this love's a fire
Baby burn me
I've been getting higher
On your body
If this love's an ocean
Baby drown me
I just wanna feel a little closer
Closer to you
A little closer to you
Feel a little cl-closer
A little closer to you
Feel a little cl-closer

I just wanna feel a little closer
Feel a little cl-closer
Feel a little cl-closer
Feel a little cl-closer
Feel a little cl-closer4Embed
