Kid Cudi Remix Lyrics[Intro]
(Power up)

[Verse]
All this Amiri I need an endorsement
This jewelry is wet like a faucet
I’ve been ballin' on niggas like Spalding
I need acres I don't want no apartment
Diss on the gang we gon' off you
Stealin' my swag like I taught you
Pour Up' 'cause I'm feelin' nauseous
Tell me she love me, she lost me
She see the racks now she rocking ' with a nigga
Still give her that D and I'm not her nigga
Nigga that GLE 63 ride right through you
Big body pullin' out [?]
This nigga mad cause' his bitch want pictures '
Top of the mornin' I'm countin' up figures
Whole gang got racks so I'm proud of my niggas
And I gave em' the blueprint this shit not a riddle
Two thots with me like Malcolm In The Middle
She got three holes only want the mouth in the middle
Kyrie through the pressure I ain't stoppin' my drill
I be thumbin' through racks like I'm reading a kindle

Diss on' the gang we gon' off you
Stealin' my swag like I taught you
Swerve cause' I'm feelin' nauseous
Tell me she love me, she lost me
She see the racks now she rocking' with a nigga
Still give her that D and I'm not her nigga
