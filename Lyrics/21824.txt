Under My Skin Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's getting under my skin
This low and down feeling
Don't know what I did
But I done it good
Tomorrow come
And I'll be waiting
With my head held high
I'm not looking to run

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I've been taking my time, baby
And I ain't talking too much lately
Oh, I don't know what I want, Can you help me?
Cause I've been wasting my time, Oh but
I don't know what I need
Can you help me to find, Something
[Chorus]
It's getting under my skin

[Verse 2]
And you took me down
And what a slow fall
But what I needed
To be right here
And for one
It seems that I've found
That all the answers
Were all so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I've been taking my time, baby
And I ain't talking too much lately
Oh, I don't know what I want, Can you help me?
Cause I've been wasting my time, Oh but
I don't know what I need
Can you help me to find, Something

[Chorus]
It's getting under my skin
It's getting under my skin

[Outro]
