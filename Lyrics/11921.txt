[Verse 1: Sharc & Pi'erre Bourne]
Brown water boy, free Max B
Passed up, tats on her asscheek (Yeah)
Tequila in her cup, do it nasty
Glock 19 on the backstreet (Glock 19 on the)
Drive through, stick on the Benz seat
Fiji clit, need a jet ski (Splash)
Shorty get bent and nasty (Shorty get bent, nasty)
Biting her lip while the cat leak
She send me that kitty on Snappy (Yeah)
Chanelly official, real baddie
Chop house dinner, Manhattan (Mmh)
V12 engine, big cannon
She twerk while her Patek is dancing
She model the Fenty Savage (Fenty Savage)
She want her a Bentley wagon (Skrr)
Put your cup in the air if you ratchet
She wanna get drunk, nasty (Drunk and then nasty)
She wanna get drunk and then nasty (Drunk and nasty)
We don't talk nice, that's nasty (Drunk and nasty)
VVS ice on the Banshee
Big .45 in Miami

Kill from the side of her panties
I'm rolling like Drake on Degrassi (Can you?)
