Full Control Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't even wanna fix it now
Should know better than to wait around
All in a haze
Couldn't shake it for the rest of the day

And if you shoot it down
You better get back up
You better get back up

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry babe, that's not where I'm at
Shouldn't be here when you get back
Just to stand in line
Wait for you and then waste my time
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you spill your guts
And try new clothes
And try new clothes

[Chorus]
I'm in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

[Verse 3]
Hold your breath when you hold the door
I never think about it anymore
Now when I lay back
It goes to nothing or it goes to black

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you spill your guts
I hope he's enough
I hope he's enough

[Chorus]
In full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not
[Outro]
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even though it's notYou might also likeEmbed
