Rock & Roll Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know

[Verse 2]
'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand

[Bridge]
And she will follow me wide, do you know?
Familiar places she's been by that I know
Could it be she don't have to try?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And tomorrow she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to findYou might also likeEmbed
