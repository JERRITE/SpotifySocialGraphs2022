For the Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Hi Ayesha", nice to meet ya
Six double O for a beat and a feature
Rocking my Juicy baby tee
I'm the raunchy motherfucker you pay to see
I got lip gloss, glitter tits
On a street corner just shaking my shit
I grew up on Kim, Fox and Madonna
Dream about Dolce & Gabbana
Please, sipping on rum & blue freeze
Pinch the nips, I'm a tease
Wanna get real coked up, wanna pop the percs
Lemme show you how it works
In a schoolgirl skirt with the knee high socks
Walk down the block and catch all the cops
Don't call the cops, I got hooking money
I'm the real life cartoon Playgirl bunny, bitch
[Interlude 1]
Oh God
That's hot
Okay

[Verse 2]
I got accolades
Track shorts high when I pass the trade
In a flimsy top, bags still searched with the hems he bought
Ooh, the thighs are tanny
Big Juicy for a fucking Grammy
Big dick, I need a fucking whammy
Blood stains on my fucking panties, ooh
Baby come fuck with me, ooh-ooh
Baby don't fuck for free
Cheap liquor, expensive shit
I beat that bitch with a hit, lemme get a hit
Sit back, let the coke drip
Thigh-high boots with the satin slit
Out the back, I just let it slip
And here's a tip, suck on my tits

[Interlude 2]
Is that my Red Bull?
Can you give it to me?
No, I'm recording a song
Hurry up

[Outro]
This is actually really good
If you listened
Oh, wait
It's only like two minutes but still it's really good
You should listen1Embed
