TranslationsDeutschEverything’s Electric Lyrics[Verse 1]
The city is burning
Sinking ships in the ocean
With a head full of dreams at night
Sorrow's written the story of life
Ain't nothing to do, but
I was digging for gold dust
I see the shame in your eyes this time
And no, baby, it's cold inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Your fake humble called out, got you tongue-tied
Your best chance at success got ya denied
No, you thought I wouldn't know?
[Chorus]
I don't hate you
But I despise that feeling
There's nothing left for me here
You won't know if you don't go
Superficial feelings
It's hard to take it easy
Underneath the red sun
Everything's elеctric

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what do you love?
And would you lеt it kill you?
With a head full of dreams at night
Sorrows written the story of life
The higher we go
The longer that we can fly
I never knew what you wanted
So I gave you everythin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Your life's shorter, most days are long now
Chain of missing links is all that's left now
No, you gotta let it go

[Chorus]
I don't hate you
But I despise that feeling
There's nothing left for me here
You won't know if you don't go
Superficial feelings
It's hard to take it easy
Underneath the red sun
Everything's electric
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't hate you
But I despise that feeling
There's nothing left for me here
You won't know if you don't go
Superficial feelings
It's hard to take it easy
Underneath the red sun
Everything's electric1Embed
