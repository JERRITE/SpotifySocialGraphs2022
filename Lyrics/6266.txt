Donâ€™t Break the Heart Lyrics[Intro]
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting here in this lonely room
No, there's nothing left, it's only me and you
Holding onto heaven but the heaven's closed down on me
Nothing lasts forever, nothing goes to plan
Don't you lose your grip, you're letting go of my hand
'Cause every single second is a second that we can't get back
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go, going cold in the silence
Never know till you hear all the sirens
I should go, but if this is the end of the line then

[Chorus]
Hold me close and we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you

[Verse 2]
One minute you're here, then you're gone the next
Turning into strangers like we never met
Counting every blessing like a lesson that you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go, going cold in the silence
Never know till you hear all the sirens
I should go, but if this is the end of the line then

[Chorus]
Hold me close and we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you
(That's loving you, that's loving you, that's loving you)
Don't break the heart that's loving you

Here we go, going cold in the silence
Never know till you hear all the sirens
I should go, but if this is the end of the line then

[Chorus]
Hold me close and we can lay here one last time
Don't slip away, leave me behind
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you
Try my best at being brave
But this is more than I can take
I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
Don't break the heart that's loving you

[Outro]
Sitting here in this lonely room
No there's nothing left
There's only me and you
Holding onto heaven but the heaven's closed down on me1Embed
