Mean, Green, Killing Machine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somewhere out where no one knows
Runs a cool evolution fight
Way out there where no one goes
And it's got to keep moving
Got to keep getting it right
Sphere's to the piston charged
Combustable delight
The single-minded supercharged
That's got to get moving
Got to keep getting it right
[Chorus]
A call to arms
A call right through the dream
A call to action
Blow up the in between
Feed, feed your engine
Feed, feed your wolverine
Feed, feed the tension
Mean green killing machine

[Post-Chorus]
C'mon, c'mon and say what my name is
Mean green killing machine

[Verse 2]
So mother Mary gave the nod
The saints bathed in holy light
The machine that hit the lightning rod
That had to keep rolling
Rolling on through the night
In the deep dark underground
With eyes that have no sight
So here's to the battleground
That's got to keep rolling
Got to keep rolling
You might also like[Chorus]
A call to arms
A call right through the dream
A call to action
Blow up the in between
Feed, feed your engine
Feed, feed your wolverine
Feed, feed the tension
Mean green killing machine

[Post-Chorus]
C'mon, c'mon and say what my name is
(Mean green killing machine)

[Bridge 1]
The clock, your only friend
As time leaves it's debris
Your soul is on the mend
But time is killing me
I gave you everything
But a machine
I'll always be

[Bridge 2]
They got nothing more to add to the conversation
They drink gasoline from a dirty glass
They got nothing but a sad–sad situation
With nothing more to add to the damnation
Nuts & bolts & screws with no social class
They got nothing but a sad–sad situation
It's a sad, sad, sad, sad situation
Nuts & bolts & screws, balls of brass
[Verse 3]
If you're out where no one goes
Where no one cares to lie
Keep 'em open don't you blink
I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout your eyes
It's faster than the speed of light
And sonically disguised
There comes the mean green motherfucker blazing 'cross the sky

[Chorus]
A call to arms
A call right through the dream
A call to action
Blow up the in between
Feed, feed your engine
Feed, feed your wolverine
Feed, feed the tension
Mean green killing machine
Killing machine
Killing machine
Mean green killing machineEmbed
