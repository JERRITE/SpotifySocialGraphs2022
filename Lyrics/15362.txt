The Past Recedes Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
And then the past recedes and I won't be involved
The effort to be free, seems pointless from above
You're looking down at me, I'd rather stay below
Than have you staring up at me is nowhere I want to go

[Chorus 1]
Ay, this business of how long we try to stay alive
Why to be here you first got to die so I gave it a try
And what do you know, time was so long ago
[Verse 2]
And things come back you see to where they don't belong
And every drop of sea is the whole ocean

[Chorus 2]
I lied to the greatest thieves about anything and everything
I'm a figure of forgotten speech, I'm out of reach
Oh, I can't play it safe, but I might just in case

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
I'm disguised as a reaching hand, I'm a working man
I don't understand why clockout comes so slow everytime
That's one line I stay right behind
That's one line I stay right behindYou might also like9Embed
