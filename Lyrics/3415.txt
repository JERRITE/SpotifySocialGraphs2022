BAND$ Lyrics[Chorus: AYLEK$]
We got the bands, we got the cash
Bro, will bust out yo' back
She want the molly, she want the xans
She gon' fuck for the cash
Trap in Japan, then we to France
We gon' fuck up this bag (fuck it up)
That lil' bitch gon miss me
Get the fuck in the cab
Sippin' on Henny now I'm feelin' real litty
Bad lil' bitch wanna feel up on her titty
Ain't about money then they call, I'ma miss it
That's yo bitch? Damn, my big bro been hit
We got the bands, we got the cash
Bro, will bust out yo' back
She want the molly, she want the xans
She gon' fuck for the cash
[Verse 1: Blocboy JB]
We got them bands, we got that cash
I'm off this shit, I feel like I can't last
Nascar the new ferrari, check out the digital dash
Think 'bout them niggas I shot in the past
223 hit the window, make him crash
Y'know I'm living my life like my last
I get that cash in amazing ways
Y'know that my palm be itchin'
The money be talking to me
Nowadays, I can't got to the store, I hate walking for free
In Miami, I'm south of the beach
Get yo bitch, ride her out of the beach
I'm from the south, we throw peace to hater unless he running off with the meat
Say the wrong thing, get you pick of yo teeth
Niggas can't fuck with a pickover G
You got the bands, you got the stash
We gon' find where you at
We feeling good, I did 'em bad
I just ran off with his cash
I'm in a good mood, so I'm feeling great
Robbed a nigga to put food on my plate
Asked my nigga do he want some steak
He said, "We hit a lick, we already ate."

[Chorus: AYLEK$]
We got the bands, we got the cash
Bro, will bust out yo' back
She want the molly, she want the xans
She gon' fuck for the cash
Trap in Japan, then we to France
We gon' fuck up this bag (fuck it up)
That lil' bitch gon miss me
Get the fuck in the cab
Sippin' on Henny now I'm feelin' real litty
Bad lil' bitch wanna feel up on her titty
Ain't about money then they call, I'ma miss it
That's yo bitch? Damn, my big bro been hit
We got the bands, we got the cash
Bro, will bust out yo' back
She want the molly, she want the xans
She gon' fuck for the cash

Scam another bitch leave the piece on decline
