This Is Real LyricsOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
What you, what you gon' do?

Got vertigo falling down
'Cause you're going to my head
Cannot recognize the sound
Of my own heart calling

I found somewhere, I found someone
And I found somewhere, somewhere that I belong
Belong, belong
This is real
And you've been right here all along
This is real
And I could never get enough

And I'll be holding on, holding on
And you'll be the somebody who can give me love, give me love
Never gonna give you up
And I'll be holding on, holding on
And you'll be the somebody who can give me love, give me love
Never gonna give you up, oh yeah

Oh, the energy's running high
Resisting my own defence
This vision is our design
Oh, the energy's running

I found somewhere, I found someone
And I found somewhere, somewhere that I belong
I found somewhere, and I found someone
I found somewhere, somewhere that I belong
Belong, belong

This is real
And you've been right here all along
This is real
And I could never get enough

And you'll be the somebody who can give me love, give me love
Never gonna give you up
And I'll be holding on, holding on
And you'll be the somebody who can give me love, give me love
Never gonna give you up

(Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give you
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give you
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give)

This is real
And you've been right here all along
This is real
And I could never get enough

And you'll be the somebody who can give me love, give me love
