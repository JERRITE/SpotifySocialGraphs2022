Plain Sight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll take you there
Where the sun sets over the sea
Hard place where no one gets
What they gonna see

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't feel my feet
Am I way too deep?
Holding on for an hour
Have we faded in, faded in, faded in
[Chorus]
Tell me what we're feeling is all true
Waiting into lose it
Spotlight and now it's on us
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight

[Verse 2]
We are shadows in the dark
So I won't dance, stop talking
Show me your spark
Cause we are in plain sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't feel my feet
Am I way too deep?
Holding on for an hour
Have we faded in, faded in, faded in

[Chorus]
Tell me what we're feeling is all true
Waiting into lose it
Spotlight and now it's on us
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
You might also like[Bridge]
I'll take you to do whatever you wanna do
So you can come with me to feel what you've never seen
I feel like they've taken us away
I couldn't care less about what they have to say

[Chorus]
Tell me what we're feeling is all true
Waiting into lose it
Spotlight and now it's on us
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight
Tell me what we're feeling is all true
Waiting into lose it
Spotlight and now it's on us
Tell me you are losing it all, too
Waiting here, but now we're stuck in plain sight1Embed
