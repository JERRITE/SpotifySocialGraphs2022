Cornflower Blue LyricsI want to lay on the kitchen floor with you
I want to do all the things that lovers do
Bruised on your face like a watercolour bloom
Moonlight paints your skin cornflower blue

You love me 'til you wear me out, then you love me more
I'm blue to the middle just like you, freezing to the core
The days, they fly like trains go by when I'm on my way home to you
And I think about if they ran me down, baby, what would you do?

I want to lay on the train tracks with you
I want to tie you down the way that lovers do
In the morning, I'll love the mangled bits of you
I'll love you when your lips turn cornflower blue
I love you 'til I wear you out, then I love you more
Now all the things that we don't talk about are waiting at the door
I won't let you out of my sight, even when you're sleeping
So baby, take your medicine and promise me you're eating

Who will I say goodnight to when you're gone?You might also like1Embed
