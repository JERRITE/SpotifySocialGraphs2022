You Donâ€™t Wanna Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
You think that I'm a little angel
You only see what you wanna believe
You dress me up with wings and a halo
But there's burning brimstone underneath
Some sins better left unsaid
Some things you just don't confess

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna kill you
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna break you down
Might drive you crazy but trust me baby
You don't wanna know what you don't know
[Verse 2]
You think you're a real good liar
You think you got one on me
Truth is I got my own little fire
Pretty soon you're gonna feel the heat
Two wrongs don't make it right
But I sleep pretty good at night

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna kill you
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna break you down
Might drive you crazy but trust me baby
You don't wanna know what you don't know

[Bridge]
Trust me baby
You're gonna cry
You're about to get a taste of your own lies, oh no

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna kill you
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna break you down
No no
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna kill you
You don't know, you don't know what's gonna break you down
No no
Might drive you crazy but trust me baby
You don't wanna know what you don't know
You might also like[Outro]
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know, you don't know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know, you don't know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know, you don't know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know, you don't know
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know, you don't knowEmbed
