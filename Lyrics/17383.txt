​pomegranate Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
It’s shining like three seeds of pomegranates in my hands
It’s just us that’s on this beach and all this sand
All of this water
I know but damn
I know we ain’t supposed to touch it
We only live once ma’am (Sparkle for me)
You said give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Then said take it, take it, take it
I said did we do this really?
Shouldn’t we have waited? Waited?
You’re making faces, probably so am I
We’re in the ocean
Waves are rolling in your eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Pulse is high, the heartbeats
We’re being called to the other side, girl
Lost in the vibe, we can’t sleep
Our clothes off
Feels so good inside, girl
(Sparkle for me)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It’s been oh, so long
Since we’ve been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)
It’s been oh, so long
Since we’ve been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
What’s the reason why we should do this tonight?
Spend the night, spend the night
Spend the night, spend the night (Sparkle for me)
So much you won’t see without open eyes
'Cause closed eyes, is closed sight
And closed mind, is closed vibe (Sparkle for me)
Yeah, new feelings it’s bringing in
What’s this tone I’m singing in? (Sparkle for me)
Your eyes are twinkling
My limbs are tingling (Sparkle for me)
You are my synonym
You’re my best friend in the world (Sparkle for me)
All this adrenaline (Yeah, yeah)
Melting like M&M’s
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Pulse is high, the heartbeats
We’re being called to the other side, girl
Lost in the vibe, we can’t sleep
Our clothes off
Feels so good inside, girl

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It’s been oh, so long
Since we’ve been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)
It’s been oh, so long
Since we’ve been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me
