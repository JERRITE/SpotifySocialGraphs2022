Don’t You Wanna Play? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I keep going over
Every moment in my head
If I only told ya
Would it matter if I said?
I want you 'round me all the time
And not just every other night
I'm tired of pretending like
We going nowhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not overthink it
Let's just say it like it is
You know we have a good thing
Not just friends with benefits
[Chorus]
Let's call it love
Call it whatever you want
Together we're bulletproof
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?

[Post-Chorus]
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?

[Verse 2]
I'm wearing your t-shirt
And I don't wanna take it off
It's my little secret
And I can't get enough
Of every little thing you do
So why you stepping 'round the truth?
You're feeling me, I'm feeling you
What are we doing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's not overthink it
Let's just say it like it is
You know we have a good thing
Not just friends with benefits
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's call it love
Call it whatever you want
Together we're bulletproof
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?

[Post-Chorus]
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little longer
Play a little
Play a little longer
Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play? Don't you wanna play?1Embed
