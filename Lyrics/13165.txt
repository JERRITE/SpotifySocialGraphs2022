I Belong in Your Arms - Photek Remix LyricsCrossin' my heart
Open wide
You're my crystal and clover

All of me
Honestly
Is dedicated to hold you

Swear to god
Double knot
What would you do if I stole you
Tonight
Why waste time
Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All sillhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
I belong in your arms
I belong in your arms

Feelings are good
Nothing to say
Just want my head on your shoulder
Banana split
Honestly
You're my remote controller
Between you and me
Suddenly
Something something something
Is on my mind

Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All sillhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
I belong in your arms
I belong in your arms

Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All sillhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
I belong in your arms
I belong in your arms
