Unlimited Ammo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Unlimited ammo, orange colored camo
I could never run out of you
A million shadows, technology nano
I could never run out of you

[Chorus]
I could never run out of you
I could never reload all my feelings for you
You hurt me but I hurt you too
I could never reload all my feelings for you
[Verse 2]
See me in the magazines
Slow motion movie scene
Feeling high, dopamine
Crushing like I'm 17
Headshot, guillotine
Friendly fire on my team
Trigger on my fingertips (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hit the target never miss (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Trigger on my fingertips (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hit the target never miss (Oh yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I could never run out of you
I could never reload all my feelings for you (Reload, reload, reload)
You hurt me but I hurt you too
I could never reload all my feelings for you (Ahh)
I could never run out of you
I could never reload all my feelings for you
You hurt me but I hurt you too
I could never reload all my feelings for youYou might also likeEmbed
