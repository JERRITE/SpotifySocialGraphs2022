Canâ€™t Stop The Feeling! (Film Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake & Both]
I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric wavy when I turn it on
And if you want it inside your soul
Just open up your heart, let music take control

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake & Anna Kendrick]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Anna Kendrick, with James Corden, All, Ron Funches]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close (Can't stop, won't stop)
When we move, well, you already know (Let's go, let's work)
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

[Chorus: All]
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick & Both]
Ooh, it's somethin' magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (Rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (Need control)
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake & Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake]
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Chorus: All]
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
I feel good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling! Yeah
So keep dancing, come on

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Feel good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling!)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feeling!

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Everybody sing
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come onEmbed
