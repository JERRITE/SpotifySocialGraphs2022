Loveâ€™s Divine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Then the rainstorm came over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost all of my belief, you see
And realized my mistake
But time threw a prayer to me
And all around me became still

[Hook]
I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name
[Verse 2]
Through the rainstorm came sanctuary
And I felt my spirit fly
I had found all of my reality
I realize what it takes

[Hook]
'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

[Post-hook]
Oh I, don't bend (don't bend), don't break (don't break)
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name

[Verse 3]
Well I try to say there's nothing wrong
But inside I felt me lying all along
But the message here was plain to see
Believe me

[Hook]
'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

Oh I, don't bend (don't bend), don't break (don't break)

'Cause love can help me know my name

Love can help me know my name
Love can help me know my name3Embed
