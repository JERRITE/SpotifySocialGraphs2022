Baby Get On Your Knees Lyrics[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yo, Whoo Kid, man. Yo, drop this shit, man. I gotta go, man. Let's hurry up, let's go, man. Oh yeah. 50 Cent, uh. G-Unit. Oh, man. I'm feeling myself right now

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
(Come on, baby, just kiss it for me
Just put it in your mouth)
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She was hesitant at first, said she never did it before
As soon as I got her going she was going like a pro
She went up and down like a merry go round
And round and round and splash
She's freaky freaky, when you get her in the bed
You need a G like me to get her to give you head
My conversation is stimulating
She in room ten-nineteen in the Hilton waiting
She got a thing for ballas, I mean a thing for balls
And I had turned her ass out so I'm the one she calls
On the cheek she kiss me and she tell me she miss me
Being around me got her used to drinking Don and Cristy
I'm a special nigga, look, I'm used to blinding
Keep that Benzo clean and those spreewells shining

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you

(You can't be serious? It's four in the morning..)
Right in the morning I rolled over
Guess who was over my shoulder
A pretty round, round, round
Who just got finished going downtown
But at night with no lights I have you wondering
If it's a lighting bolt in your mouth or a glow-in-the-dark tongue ring
Banks need a ghetto chick, set a nigga up wit ass
Sneak around till he fall asleep, digging in his stash
Leave with everything, rob a Benz, stacks and the grass
Ass so fat she get handclaps when she pass
I ain't never had a girl, but you can be my bottom bitch
I done been around the world, we done hit all kind of chicks
Range Rover, never sober, Hennessey, vanilla soda
B-A-N-K dolla sign, bitch
Nah, I ain't here to hold you
Let your baby daddy roll his shoulder
Banks don't associate with no tricks
I'ma make it a G-Unit party, from the hotel lobby
And if you ain't trying to freak off then go home, bitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
[Verse 3: Young Buck]
You know what I came to do, let you put your lips on my dick
But don't tell nobody, you my mistress, bitch
All your friends keep telling you what to do when you get me
Got to eat the nuts first like a Hershey's Kisses
Bitch, show me you miss me like I'm Pac or Biggie
She can be small as Eve or even big as Missy
I like it when them dikes indugle in group six
Suck off thanks to 50 and B-Light, unit
Get your ass suplexed, telling me to go down
I'm a P-I-M-P, bitch, I bet you know now
Baby girl, slow down, ou make a nigga cum quick
When you closed your eyes and make your tongue do a twist
You my 3 o'clock, lolipop, kiss the last drop, bitch
Walk around naked, hoe, I met your ass topless
She finally found out what Young Buck is 'bout
So give a nigga from the south some of that mouth

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
Baby, if you get on your knees
Put me in your mouth and suck me off
You know I got you
(Come on, girl, you know I got you)
