[Verse 2: Fijimacintosh]
Rock band, feel like a rock band, uh
Hundreds in my left hand and my right hand, uh
All these niggas yes men, I keep my weapon, uh
Walkin' in McQueen, only way I'm steppin'
You can't even come in my area
I got a chopper, that bitch get to flarin'
She wanna fuck by the way that she starin'
I fuck that ho then I run me some errands
It's twenty K just to go make an appearance
I went and spent it on brand new earrings
Flooded my fingers, don't know about marriage
I'm this bitch daddy, I turned to a parent
I got them racks but I am not sharing
I got them racks but I am not sharing
I got them racks but I am not sharing

Jump off the stage, bro, jump off the stage, bro, who is you darin'?
We shinin' nigga, just—we shinin' nigga, just—we shinin' nigga, just look in the mirror
