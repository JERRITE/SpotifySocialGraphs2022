Best Kept Secret Lyrics[JASON]
I know this world can have a place for us
If we just try to find a way to trust
That time will be kind
In a fantasy I dream awake
But reality is give and take
You take what you can
You give time a chance
We have to wait until the world is fast asleep
I'll wipe away the doubt
And show you why we keep
The best kept secret
The best kept secret of all
[PETER]
All I ever want is there in your eyes
They tell me I'm alright and I realize
I always knew
We whisper words when we're alone at night
I want to hear them in the morning light
And with love on our side
Maybe we'd be alright

Beneath a million stars there's no need to pretend
I look around tonight and wonder why we can't end
The best kept secret

[JASON]
It's best kept secret

[PETER, JASON]
Didn't you see how no one in there cared?
A thousand people saw us dancing there
You have to give the world a chance
A chance to what?
To see how deep the world can cut?
This is all a fantasy
Then we go back to school
Just think it through
I think it through and then you shut me out
You're such a coward
And you're a fool
You might also like[PETER, JASON, PETER & JASON]
You know we can't go on forever this way
All this "forever", can't you live for today?
We have to grow up
There's so much more to love
It's best kept secret
The best kept secret
Best kept secret

(spoken)
I love you, JasonEmbed
