BI-POLAR FREESTYLE Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't go outside
Baby, I'm not your type
'Cause I feel dead inside
I think I hate my life

[Verse 1]
What you know about being bipolar?
I think I'm a little anti-social
What you know about never being sober?
I wake up at seven in the morning just to throw up
I don't know why the hell you wanna be like me
My life's fuckin' miserable, I don't know why you like me
I don't know why the hell all these rappers bite me
Talk about me so much, think they wanna pipe me
What you know about scars on the wrist?
Nobody fuck with me so I just gotta ride my own dick
What you know about being depressed?
You just wanna be a part of something, just give it a rest
I only smoke weed when I'm stressed
If I do the math, that's between every breath
[Chorus]
I don't go outside
Baby, I'm not your type
'Cause I feel dead inside
I think I hate my life

[Verse 2]
Double vision twenty-four seven
Tunnel vision twenty-four seven
Money mission twenty-four seven
In the kitchen twenty-four seven
It's okay to hate me 'cause I hate myself
You can better face me, I can't face myself
Bitch, I'm Doodle Bob, I might erase myself
Heaven tryna take me, I'ma take myself
What you know about being bipolar?
I think I'm a little anti-social
What you know about never being sober?
I wake up at seven in the morning just to throw up
I don't know why the hell you wanna be like me
My life's fuckin' miserable, I don't know why you like me
I don't know why the hell all these rappers bite me
Talk about me so much, think they wanna pipe meYou might also like5Embed
