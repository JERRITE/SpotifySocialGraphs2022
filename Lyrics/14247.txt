I Canâ€™t Stand It Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a passage in my mind
That pocket's thoughts of you
And all the things that come with emotional ties

Though memories do fade
This heavy heart inside of me
Hates that I said all those things to you and

[Chorus]
I'd forget you if I could
I know I probably should be sleeping
Not thinking this through
But I can't stand it
I can't stand it
[Verse 2]
Fooling myself dry
You're like no other
Booked myself for some amnesia to keep me in line
Why do I fall in love
With the least bit of attention
I need some direction, affection in time

[Chorus]
I'd forget you if I could
I know I probably should be sleeping
Not thinking this through
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

[Bridge]
While I was thinking of a plan
She sent the snow then took my hand
I shut you out, you changed my mind
The echoes from beside the scenes where you would cry

[Chorus]
I'd forget you if I could
I know I probably should be sleeping
Not thinking this through
But I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
You might also likeI can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it2Embed
