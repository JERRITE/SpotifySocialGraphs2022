Alone No More Lyrics[Another Level]
Why do we argue the way we do?
Can't you see, girl, that I, I'm in love with you?

[Verse 1: Another Level]
Don't run away from my love, that you need
Don't turn away from my love, you see
You are the reason that I won't leave
And I want you to remain with me

[Chorus: Another Level]
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe like I do?
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do?
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do

[Hook: Another Level]
Why do we argue the way we do?
Can't you see, girl, that I, I'm in love with you?

[Verse 2: Another Level]
And it hurts (It hurts so bad)
When you cry (To see you sad and blue)
When I'm needing you the most
But you feel (You feel someone)
When no one (will take this place of you)
Of you

[Bridge: Another Level]
Can't you see, girl, Can't you see, girl
Cant' you see, girl, that I, I
Can't you see, girl, can't you see, girl
Can't you see that I'm in love with you?

Can't you see, girl, Can't you see, girl
Can't you see, girl that I, I
Can't you see, girl, can't you see, girl
Can't you see that I'm in love with you?
[Chorus: Another Level]
(And I know what I feel)
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do

No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do
No, I don't wanna be alone
No more
Do you believe in love like I do2Embed
