I Just Wanna Shine Lyrics[Chorus]
I just wanna shine like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today’s gonna be my day
I just wanna climb to the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howlin'
’Cause today's gonna be my
Day's gonna be my
Day's, day's, day's, day's, day's

[Verse 1]
Goodnight stress, see you in the morning
I don’t gotta guess, you’re always there for me
Sowing them seeds of doubt, I think you like seeing me freak out
Goodnight stress, see you in the morning
[Pre-Chorus]
So I wake up, I get out of bed
Stay up, stay out of my head
'Cause it’s dangerous
And I don't wanna lose my mind, no

[Chorus]
I just wanna shine like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb to the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I’m howlin'
'Cause today's gonna be my day

[Verse 2]
I used to lay low, hiding in the shadows
So don't give me dark days, I already had those
I'm just trying to figure out how to be myself right now
I don't wanna lay low, hiding in the shadows

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wake up, I get out of bed
Stay up, stay out of my head
'Cause it's dangerous
And I don't wanna lose my mind, no
You might also like[Chorus]
I just wanna shine like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb to the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howlin'
'Cause today's gonna be my day

[Bridge]
I wake up and I stay up
'Cause I'm sure good things will happen
If I get out of my way

[Chorus]
I just wanna shine like the sun when it comes up
Run the city from the rooftops
'Cause today's gonna be my day
I just wanna climb to the top of a mountain
Standing tall when I'm howlin'
'Cause today's gonna be my day1Embed
