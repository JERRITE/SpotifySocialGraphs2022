My Goddess LyricsI was knee deep in a sick love
I was cross eyed under your drug
Schizo savior
Mad messiah
Fatal worship
You inspired

Gone, I don't believe in you now
I've seen too much
I don't believe in you now
My goddess
You were counting on a free fall
You laid your bet
I would lose all
Chalk up one less crucifixion
I kick that sick old addiction

Damn, I don't believe in you now
I've seen too much
I don't believe in you now
My goddess

Now you see
What you get when you lose yourself
What you get when you don't know who you are
When you don't know who you are
My goddess

Gone, I don't believe in you now
I've seen too much
I don't believe in you now
My goddess

I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you
My goddess

I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you
