Wicked Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Run away, run away
I need time to figure out
Wide awake, wide awake
Seeing signs of slowing down
Oh yeah, we wake up in the morning, think about the nights
Every drink we’re pouring, starts another fight
It’s a hazard to our health, but we do it to ourselves
Every time, every time

[Chorus]
Who knew nobody could hurt me like you do
Stuck me in the dark like voodoo
Go on make your mark, yeah
I'ma love you from afar
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
Wanna love you from afar, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
[Verse 2]
I don’t know where is home
Or where to go or what to say anymore
‘Cause I swear that I’ve done and I wrote and I sang
All the same shit that you’ve heard before
Because we wake up in the morning, think about the night
How I spent $200 on a dinner and we fight
It’s a hazard to our health, but we do it to ourselves
Every time, every time

[Chorus]
Who knew nobody could hurt me like you do
Stuck me in the dark like voodoo
Go on make your mark, yeah
I'ma love you from afar
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
Wanna love you from afar, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
I wanna love you from afar, baby
Bless your wicked heart

[Bridge]
We never meant for this to be so tragic
Let’s go back to the way it was
Maybe you can do your quick black magic
Bring to life all that's dead with us
You might also like[Chorus]
Who knew nobody could hurt me like you do
Stuck me in with your voodoo
Go make your mark baby, go make your mark
I'ma love you from afar
Who knew, nobody could hurt me like you do
Stuck me in the dark like voodoo
Go on make your mark, yeah
I'ma love you from afar
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
(Your wicked heart, your wicked heart)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
(Your wicked heart, your wicked heart)
Wanna love you from afar, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
(Your wicked heart, your wicked heart)
I know you mean no harm, baby
Bless your wicked heart (Na na, na na)
(Your wicked heart)
I wanna love you from afar, baby
Bless your wicked heart

[Outro]
Your wicked heart, your wicked heart
