Find Myself Lyrics[Intro]
Sometimes I be feelin' like I don't really got nobody
So I release this pain in my songs
Oh-oh, I need someone to talk to
I need someone to vent to

[Chorus]
I been branchin' off alone, can't seem to find myself
And I ain't sayin' I need nobody, I'm tryin' to find myself
Reminiscing about them days of strugglin', nobody askin' for help
Throwin' my life on the line for y'all, ain't sacrifice yourself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself
[Verse 1]
That nigga told me that he love me
Mama told me he wasn't for me
Left my heart in the interrogation room 'cause he was tellin' on me
I told 23 that I love him and I'm here for him
I ain't gon' question, I ain't gon' skip no beat
He know I'ma spin for him
And I'm like mirror mirror on the wall
Show me who creep so I can kill 'em all
And I'm like mirror mirror on the wall
Show me who creep so I can kill 'em all
BT I know you said I changed up
Promise this loyalty and love is still the same bruh
Took you on your first stain boy
Talked to K so he brought down, told me he feel pain
Most of all they feel betrayed, 'posed to be loyalty to the grave
And I'm like ooh, and I'm like ooh
Race back, race back, watch my surroundings

[Chorus]
I been branchin' off alone, can't seem to find myself
And I ain't sayin' I need nobody, I'm tryin' to find myself
Reminiscing about them days of strugglin', nobody askin' for help
Throwin' my life on the line for y'all, ain't sacrifice yourself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself

The other day me and Flip got in a lil altercation, hurt me so deep
Told me he love me, it was just a misunderstanding
I ain't never speak to Tree 'bout what I saw was posted on Insta
She threw a slick shot, but I seen her caption the pictures
Smile on my face, distract the pain, I hide away
Drop to my knees, I just be praying for better days
Smile on my face, distract the pain, I hide away
Drop to my knees, I just be praying for better days
I told lil Keisha tell Miss CeCe that I love her
And MoMo like my brother
I signed my deal, first thing I did was looked out for Trae
OG tell me I do, stop wearing that thing on me straight
OG tell me I do, stop wearing that thing on me straight
And this for Chloe, you adore me
Ain't nobody did the shit that you did for me
And this for Chloe, you adore me
Ain't nobody on the earth did the shit that you did for me

[Chorus]
I been branchin' off alone, can't seem to find myself
And I ain't sayin' I need nobody, I'm tryin' to find myself
Reminiscing about them days of strugglin', nobody askin' for help
Throwin' my life on the line for y'all, ain't sacrifice yourself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself
And I'm like ooh, I'm tryna find myself, can't seem to find myself1Embed
