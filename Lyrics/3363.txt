Nowadays, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro: Lil Skies]
Ayy
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Ayy
Danny, I see you

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows
She tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold
You not in my position, I work for this, I was chose
[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Sacrifices made me the man that I am
If I had to do it, I would go back and do it again
I got money, now they love me, be acting like they my friends
Fuck that shit, I block them out, I'm not letting them people in
Red eyes, layin' low behind the tint
Remember times running from the cops, I jumped the fence
Now it's not a problem 'cause I made my mama rich
Fuck them niggas hating, we gon' throw 'em in the ditch

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows
She tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold
You not in my position, I work for this, I was chose

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
I can't lie, me and you, we not the same
I started from the bottom, took my time and built a name
They thought I would be dead but I'm still bringing major pain
Sorry, make it rain
Meet me on the side, we fly
Hit the 'Wood and close my eyes, I'm so high
Takin' flights to Dubai just to vibe
You can see it in my eyes, I'm so alive
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows
She tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold
You not in my position, I work for this, I was chose

[Verse 3: Landon Cube]
Yeah, you're not in my position, I was chosen
But I never played the victim, I'm a soldier, thought I told you
Where were you when I was on the floor? Yeah
I need closure, I need rest
I need more drugs, I need less
I roll up my medication, never sober
I'll be smokin' on this OG 'til it's over
My four leaf clover, and I
Push my luck until it's over

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Hold up, walking on a tightrope
How could I switch on you? This the only thing I know
Stay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros
Remember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros
Nowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows
She tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose
I can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold
You not in my position, I work for this, I was chose17Embed
