Storms And Hurricanes LyricsWe were feeling good
Wanting it to go on
So i took our good feeling
Put it in this song
So when you hear these chords
Know that i’ll be yours forever
Wasn’t always easy
Sometimes the money got tight
But if i’ve learned anything from it all
It’s that you’re usually right
For rich or poor
Honey i’ll be yours forever
Storms and hurricanes
Could wash this all away
As long as i’ve got you
I can take what life gives out
Make some faith out of some doubt with an attitude
Can mean so much
Don’t know exactly how that works
But i know it does
So when you hear these chords
Know that i’ll be yours forever
Storms and hurricanes
Could wash this all away
As long as i’m with you
I can take the twists and turns
The ups and downs
The lessons learned
And the mystery
It’s me and you
Finish off one episode
Got another in the queue
But when you hear these chords
Know that i’ll be yours forever
For rich or poor
Know that i’ll be yours forever, foreverYou might also likeEmbed
