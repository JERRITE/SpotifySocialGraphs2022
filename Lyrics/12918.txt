Wild Girl Lyrics[Verse 1: Empress Of]
I'm not jealous, I'm not frightened
Climb up to your lips with a swiftness
In a murmur, somewhere private
Suddenly my heart knows its weakness

[Pre-Chorus: Empress Of]
Is a half-smile touch, casually call you love
When your hand is enough, casually say it's love
Casually say it's love, casually say it's love
Casually say it's love, casually say it's love
[Chorus: Empress Of]
I'm a wild girl in the wild, in the fire
Gather me from one place or another
Loving is enough with a kiss, with a kiss
Gather me from one place or another
One place or another, aah, I'm a wild girl

[Verse 2: Empress Of]
I'm not jealous, I'm not frightened
How could we separate now in this silence?
Little by little I'm sinking right in
It's not a secret, my heart's weakness

[Pre-Chorus: Empress Of]
Is a half-smile touch, casually call you love
When your hand is enough, casually say it's love
Casually say it's love, casually say it's love
Casually say it's love, casually say it's love

[Chorus: Empress Of]
I'm a wild girl in the wild, in the fire
Gather me from one place or another
Loving is enough with a kiss, with a kiss
Gather me from one place or another
One place or another, aah, I'm a wild girl
I'm a wild girl in the wild, in the fire
Gather me from one place or another
Loving is enough with a kiss, with a kiss
Gather me from one place or another
One place or another, aah, I'm a wild girl

I miss you now, aah, I'm a wild girl

[Chorus: Empress Of]
I'm a wild girl in the wild, in the fire
Gather me from one place or another
Loving is enough with a kiss, with a kiss
Gather me from one place or another
I'm a wild girl in the wild, in the fire
Gather me from one place or another
Loving is enough with a kiss, with a kiss
Gather me from one place or another
One place or another, aah, I'm a wild girl1Embed
