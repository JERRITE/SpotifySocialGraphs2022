Haunt You Lyrics[Verse 1: Mikey]
How do I measure up to heights you've been to?
How could I ever love you like you're meant to?
How could a view of my skies light your temple?
How beautiful the bird outside my window

[Pre-Chorus: Scootie]
Always greener on my other side of things
Think so much of you, I can't overthink
Can't take my eyes off you, I don't wanna blink (No, no)
[Chorus: Mikey]
Never thought something so beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way, but I want you
Want you, want you
Sometimes, I just wanna fucking call you
Call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you

[Verse 2: Mikey]
Must be the summer breeze, the smell of orchids
Or it's the way you look, I won't forget it
Watching the devils dance outside my doorstep
Some kind of heaven I haven't seen yet

[Pre-Chorus: Scootie]
Always greener on my other side of things
Think so much of you, I can't overthink
Can't take my eyes off you, I don't wanna blink (No, no)

[Chorus: Mikey]
Never thought something so beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way, but I want you
Want you, want you
Sometimes, I just wanna fucking call you
Call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you

Never thought something so beautiful could
(Haunt you, haunt you)

[Chorus: Mikey]
Never thought something so beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way, but I want you
Want you, want you
Sometimes I just wanna fucking call you
Call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you8Embed
