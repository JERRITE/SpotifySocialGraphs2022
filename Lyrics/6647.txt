TranslationsEspañolAll the Things She Said Lyrics[Chorus: Julia & Lena]
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Enough, enough, enough)

[Verse 1: Julia, Lena]
I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else, so we can be free (Nobody else, so we can be free)
[Chorus: Julia & Lena, Lena]
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума)
This is not enough

[Post-Chorus: Julia & Lena]
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said

[Verse 2: Julia, Lena]
And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума)
This is not enough

[Post-Chorus: Julia & Lena]
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said
All the things she said

[Bridge: Lena, Julia]
Mother lookin' at me
Tell me, "What do you see?"
Yes, I've lost my mind
Daddy lookin' at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?
[Chorus: Julia & Lena, Lena]
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума)
This is not enough
