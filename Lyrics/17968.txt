Truth, Justice and Songs in Our Key Lyrics[Verse 1: Dara Reneé, Olivia Rodrigo, Julia Lester & Olivia Rodrigo, Julia Lester & Joshua Bassett]
Don't say another word...
Some of us need to be heard
You want her big confession
She never saw Dear Evan Hansen
Whatever you think about her
The show can't go on without her...

[Verse 2: Dara Reneé, Dara Reneé & Sofia Wylie & Joshua Bassett, Frankie Rodriguez, Cast of HSMTMTS]
Maybe her class could be a little more classy
Maybe her head's not in the game
Maybe her past is just a little bit sketchy
We need her all the same
[Chorus 1: Joe Serafini, Cast of HSMTMTS]
She's the one who cheers us on
So what if she's dropping the ball?
She stands for truth, justice and songs in our key
She stands for us and we believe

[Verse 3: Joshua Bassett, Sofia Wylie, Julia Lester,
Julia Lester & Joshua Bassett]
Before she got here, we were so off track
Then Miss Jenn gave us a chance
We used to fall asleep in chemistry class
Now it makes us want to dance

[Chorus 2: Alexis Nelis, Cast of HSMTMTS]
She's the show that must go on
So we're putting in a good word 'cause we heard
She stands for truth, justice and songs in our key
She stands for us and we believe

[Verse 4: Olivia Rodrigo, Dara Reneé, Julia Lester]
What's my motivation?
She provides the inspiration
Whatever about her reputation
Seems about time for a modulation

[Outro: Cast of HSMTMTS, Kate Reinders]
She stands for truth (Yeah), justice and songs in our key
Jazz squares in the choreography
Sharpay and Ryan, you know they'd agree
She stands for us and we believe
She stands for us and we believeYou might also likeEmbed
