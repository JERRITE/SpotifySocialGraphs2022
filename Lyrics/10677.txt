Ratchett Lyrics[Intro]
I ain't never gon’ ever stop
On bro

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of bitch get a bag act like nothing ever happened
Got these bitches mad, I don't feel the need to brag
Bitch, I’m Queen Key, so you know this shit a classic (Legendary shit, bitch)
Yeah, I'ma make these hoes get ratchet (Ayy)
Throw it in the bag, nigga throw it in the basket
Take that ho to class while I take lil' cuz to practice
Got head from a nerd, I knock off that nigga glasses
In my own lane, bitch, I move around the fastest
I'm getting blasted in the Calabasas (Calabasas)
I'm a bad bitch, shout out to the bastards (Yeah)
I'ma get that shit and flip that shit like it's gymnastics (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
That ho think I'm mad, bitch you’re slow I’m somewhere cashing (Bitch)
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I got cash on flash, if he ask I don’t have it (Yeah)
Nigga tragic (Can't go wild with us)
These bitches don't got no finesse in they bones (Yeah)
I been the best in my zone (Yeah)
I should invest in a throne
I should invest in a home for my grandma and Mexican holmes (Yeah)
Queen Key for president (Bitch)
These other bitches irrelevant
I dress it up like a mannequin
Not even lying, but your bitch a pelican
Bird, what's the word? (Bitch)
A lot of these niggas absurd
I’ve never been some that you could just do, bitch, I'm not a verb
Fuck what you heard (Bitch, hahahaha)
