Like I Do Lyrics[Intro: Bebe Rexha]
No one's gonna love you like I do

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Yeah, here I go again, you must think that I'm lame
Remembering back to us talkin' on AIM
And stealin' your heart, that was never my aim
See I let you leave and now nothing's the same
I'm pickin' your brain, you pick me apart
I'm pickin' your heart, you left me in dark
I guess all the pain and the hurt and the worry you left me
Returned in the shell of a star
Damn, do we end arm in arm, or are we Armageddon?
Guess you'll never know cause you never let him
Show you how he love and he trusts and he care
But all of it showed, but you never were there
So let's really see if you cared
Knew if you needed then he would be there
To put all the blame onto you isn't fair
But all you care 'bout is your makeup and hair
You're takin' a selfie, I'm takin' your shit
I see all your pics, I see who you picked
And just know, it eats me alive you're happy with him
That you're happy with him
Damn, I'm jealous, creepin' through your Instagram
And find myself askin' why the fuck that I still give a damn
About you, about us, like Mark—give her the fuck up
And although I hate his guts, I gotta give your man that thumbs up
'Cause he was bringing you close
Now he's with the one who I'm wanting the most
One minute I hate you, one minute I love you
Well, right now I'm writin' and feelin' 'em both, I can't stop

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
When I was given this beat, immediately, thought about you
Cursed with the hurt, it's a wonder I found you
Stuck here, I'm drinking and thinkin' about you
All of my friends say I'm better without you
Better without you, right?
Thought I found you on a darkest night
Could've shown you what a red carpets like
Rode up on a dark horse, the darkest knight
And the girls flowin' like water now
I wanna give 'em my heart, but it's watered down, and
And, honestly, let's keep it real
See, I'm just jealous that you found love
And I'm searchin' for it still
All of these girls are dry and lame
I want complex so that we can build
Nothing's out of my league, you ain't in my lane
And whenever we talk, now it's never the same
Being put in your friend zone is bringin' me pain
And I just wanna get you up out of my brain
Out of my brain… never been one for past tenses
And so know that I'm moving forward before I finish this sentence
I crumble when in your presence, rent time in my mind like tenants
So sorry I'm so offensive, it's hard just being your friend
And in the end I look stupid, the time I spent was useless
The truth is, honestly, girl, I miss you, and...
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Outro: Bebe Rexha]

No one's gonna care like I do77Embed
