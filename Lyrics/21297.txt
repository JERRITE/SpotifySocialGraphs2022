Favorite Sin LyricsMy heart beats fast again
Only seems to flutter when you’re around
You seem to cycle a smile that lifts me up, often brings me down
My blood runs through my veins, endorphin caged companion
So, I’ll keep you by my side and dedicate you all my time

You take all my problems
Filter them up and throw them all away
With the pleasure comes the pain that only you could bring

You’ve been given all I have
When you come around, I seem to give in
In a fight I’ll never win ‘cause all the while you’re my favorite sin
So, I salute you with both hands
It’s been bearable pain but time well spent
Never communicate, never say a word always keep it in

You take all my problems
Filter them up and throw them all away
With the pleasure comes the pain that only you could bring

You’ve been given all I have
When you come around, I seem to give in
In a fight I’ll never win ‘cause all the while you’re my favorite sin

Although you often help me, you never know what’s going on
We seem to have our problems but when I’m with you I wake up

You’ve been given all I have
When you come around, I seem to give in
In a fight I’ll never win ‘cause all the while you’re my favorite

You’ve been given all I have
When you come around, I seem to give in
In a fight I’ll never win ‘cause all the while you’re my favorite sin

You’re my favorite sin
You’re my favorite sin
You’re my favorite sin
You’re my favorite sinYou might also likeEmbed
