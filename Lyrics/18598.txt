Kiss Me Again (feat. Alex Gaskarth) Lyrics[Verse 1: Alex Gaskarth]
I gotta say something I've been thinking 'bout
I can't wait to lay around with you
And tell you all the secrets I've been keeping to myself

[Pre-Chorus: Tay Jardine]
It's been awhile
Since I've felt butterflies
Do you feel the same way too?
If every single second
Could last that much longer, would you hold me
[Chorus: Tay Jardine & Alex Gaskarth]
And kiss me again
Underneath the moonlight?
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight
Yeah, hold me, feel my heartbeat
Put your arms around me
And kiss me again
And kiss me again

[Verse 2: Alex Gaskarth]
Iâ€™ve gotta say
I wasn't expecting you to come this way
And fall into my arms
And now I know
I can't deny this feeling any longer

[Pre-Chorus: Tay Jardine]
I close my eyes
I can't stop thinking bout you
Crack a smile, I just can't lose
At a mile-a-minute my heart beats to the limit
When I'm with you

[Chorus: Tay Jardine & Alex Gaskarth]
So, kiss me again
Underneath the moonlight
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight
Yeah, hold me, feel my heartbeat
Put your arms around me
And kiss me again
You might also like[Bridge: Tay Jardine, Alex Gaskarth, both]
I can't let you go
Can't let you float away
'Cause that would be a mistake
I'm not ready to run
Can't let you go to waste
No, no, no, no

[Chorus: Tay Jardine & Alex Gaskarth]
And kiss me again
Underneath the moonlight
You're more than a friend, oh
I knew it from the first sight
Yeah, hold me, feel my heartbeat
Put your arms around me
Hold me, feel my heartbeat
And put your arms around me

[Outro: Tay Jardine & Alex Gaskarth]
Kiss me again and again and again, oh
Kiss me again1Embed
