Pieces of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's an ugly girl, does it make you want to kill her?
She's an ugly girl, do you want to kick in her face?
She's an ugly girl, she doesn't pose a threat
She's an ugly girl, does that make you feel safe?
Ugly girl, ugly girl

[Refrain]
Do you hate her 'cause she's pieces of you?

[Verse 2]
She's a pretty girl, does she make you think nasty thoughts?
She's a pretty girl, do you want to tie her down?
She's a pretty girl, do you call her a bitch?
She's a pretty girl, did she sleep with your whole town?
Pretty girl, pretty girl
[Refrain]
Do you hate her 'cause she's pieces of you?

[Verse 3]
You say he's a faggot, does it make you want to hurt him?
You say he's a faggot, do you want to kick in his brains?
You say he's a faggot, does he make you sick to your stomach?
You say he's a faggot, are you afraid you're just the same?
Faggot, faggot

[Refrain]
Do you hate him 'cause he's pieces of you?

[Verse 4]
You say he's a Jew, does it mean that he's tight?
You say he's a Jew, do you want to hurt his kids tonight?
You say he's a Jew, he'll never wear that funny hat again
You say he's a Jew as though being born were a sin
Oh Jew, oh Jew

[Refrain]
Do you hate him 'cause he's pieces of you?You might also likeEmbed
