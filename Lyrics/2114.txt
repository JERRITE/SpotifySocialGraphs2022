Pinky Promise Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gotta ask you a question, can you see through me?
See how I’m feeling? Is it easy to tell?
Cause you’re making plans and it’s starting to scare me
I don’t think you notice I’m not doing well

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me, I’ve been patient
It’s been hard, it’s wearing me down

[Chorus]
So I’m sorry, but caring ‘bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly, boy, I don’t even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore
I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore
[Verse 2]
We’re both in different places and I need some space
And we’re probably better not talking at all
'Cause, baby, I don’t deserve you, I don’t wanna hurt you
Can’t give you a smile if it’s just for a show

[Pre-Chorus]
You know me, I’ve been patient
It’s been hard, it’s wearing me down

[Chorus]
So I’m sorry, but caring ‘bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly, boy, I don’t even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore
I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore

[Voicemail Sample]
Hey, I’m really sorry
I don’t know why we’re fighting and I really fucking hate it
It’s just scary, I don’t like it and I just wanna talk

[Bridge]
We talked about a future but now it’s in the past
I don’t regret the memories but knew they wouldn’t last
I know that it’s not easy to give up what we had
I made myself a promise and I’m not looking back
You might also like[Chorus]
So I’m sorry, but caring ‘bout you is getting so exhausting
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I promise you
I promise to be honest
'Cause honestly, boy, I don’t even want this
Doing things I swore that I would never do, never do
But I promise you, I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore
I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore

[Outro]
I pinky promise I don’t love you anymore
Anymore, I don’t love you anymore5Embed
