Blame You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You scream
Then say I’m the one who’s raising my voice (my voice)
You leave
Then say everything you did was my choice (it’s just noise)

[Pre-Chorus]
You build me up then pull me under
Take me to hell and back I still put you first
I’ve been blind
You do me wrong I apologise (every time)
[Chorus]
Look at what you started
Look at what you’ve done we’re breaking in front of you
Wanted it you got it
Is it all a bit of fun, just something you wanna do
I blame you, you, you, you, you
I blame you
I blame you
I blame you, you, you, you, you
I blame you
I blame you

[Verse 2]
Until now
You made out that it was all me (all me)
Somehow
Taking all the blame was easy

[Pre-Chorus]
You make your mess and I clean it up
My friends all said you’d never be good enough
I was blind
You do me wrong, I just let it slide (every time)

[Chorus]
Look at what you started
Look at what you’ve done we’re breaking in front of you
Wanted it you got it
Is it all a bit of fun, just something you wanna do
I blame you, you, you, you, you
I blame you
I blame you
I blame you, you, you, you, you
I blame you
I blame youYou might also like1Embed
