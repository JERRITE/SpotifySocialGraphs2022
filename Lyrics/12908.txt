Coconut Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a loner
And I payed my dues
And I don't depend on nothing
Or no one
I am a loner
All confused
Waiting for that rainy day
While I spend my time
Walking in the sunshine
[Chorus]
Swinging in my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don't get to know me
No you don't get to know me

Swinging in my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don't get to know me
No no you don't get to know me

[Verse 2]
Hey you, waiting for the blow
For the big fat fall
When mama's gonna get a wake up call
Until then, I treat 'em coca
I treat 'em fries
Go put on your nice face, now
Go put on a nice face

[Chorus]
Swinging from my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don't get to know me
No you don't get to know me
You might also likeSwinging in my palm tree
Cause I love coconuts
I'm drinking Coconut Kiss
And you don't get to know me
No you don't get to know me

[Outro]
I like to watch the world
The world is looking good today
I like to watch the world
The world is looking good today
And it's almost like I'm sleeping
I pull my head back to the sun
It's almost like I'm sleeping
I pull my head back to the sun

Clean my house, from big fat flies
Dreaming of the big city
Clear my head, clean my bed
Dreaming of the big city
The big city

It's almost like I'm sleeping
I pull my head back to the sun
It's almost like I'm sleeping
I pull my head back to the sun3Embed
