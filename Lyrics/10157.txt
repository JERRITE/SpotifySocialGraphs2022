​the art of letting go Lyrics[Chorus: Destiny Rogers]
Lately, I've been dreamin' about you, baby
It's hard to stay asleep, it breaks me
I hope you realize you changed me
I wish, yeah I wish that we could have what we had before
Times I've opened up, never felt ignored
My heart will always be there, with you for sure
Your love will be the death of me but I still want more

[Verse: Phora]
Yeah, hope you still smell me on your pillows when you layin' down
And feel me standin' next to you, knowin' I ain't around
You said my еyes were thе sweetest solace you ever found
Filled with hidden truths and the ocean blue that can make you drown
My heart was burnin', you watch more of it melt
I fell in love with a girl who was at war with herself
I tried to show her my scars and I don't know if it helped
But the more we tried to hide the way we hurt, the more that we felt
'Cause I was, broke down, and needed you to console me
And trust me and take the time to show me
But you see the things that they don't see
I never thought that you would leave me lonely
Look, I know you need someone
Thought that I could be the one
Used to stay up wit' you all night, talkin' 'til we see the sun
Eventually, the mornin' comes, I had to watch you leave
I never thought you feel the need to run but maybe it was me
We closed our eyes, I held your hand and to the stars I would take you
Know you pointed all your flaws but your scars are what make you
I know the feeling, nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the, person that you trusted, never thought they would break you
But still I, give my trust away, like I never been hurt before
We give our love away 'til our feelings don't work no more
We close our hearts away to the one we should open for
But in this world full of people, you're still who I'm searchin' for
[Chorus: Destiny Rogers]
Lately, I've been dreamin' about you, baby
It's hard to stay asleep, it breaks me
I hope you realize you changed me
I wish, yeah I wish that we could have what we had before
Times I've opened up, never felt ignored
My heart will always be there, with you for sure
Your love will be the death of me but I still want moreYou might also likeEmbed
