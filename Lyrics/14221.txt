Iâ€™m A Realist LyricsI'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I'm an indecisive piece of shit
I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I am indecisive and that's about it

And you dream that's the same thing
That's the same life you lead
I don't agree
And so you drink
Don't want to think
That's 'cos your mind is already made up
I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I'm an indecisive piece of shit
I admit it
I'm up to my old tricks
Did you see her eyes
I don't know, I tried
She looked surprised...

And you dream that's the same thing
That's the same life you lead
I don't agree
And so you drink
Don't wanna think
That's 'cos your mind is already made up...no

I know that it's only a matter of time
Before you know it I'll be leaving town
See it in my eyes
That no-one will do, no-one will ever do
I know that it's only a matter of time
Before you know it I'll be leaving town
I've seen it in your eyes
That no-one will ever do, no-one will ever do
For youYou might also likeEmbed
