Tension Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never had shit, so I wear my AP when I sleep
I respect my OGs 'cause they practice what they preach
My whip customized, fully loaded, quilted seats
Buy her CC sneaks just so I don't hear a peep
I mean I got a maid that change my sheets
I'm so lit that my first crush just turned into a creep
Push-to-start, I think I lost my key under the seat
Makin' art with my home team and my whole team gon' eat

[Chorus]
Tension I feel when I go on the road
Got hittas that'll snip you down and grippin' on their pole
Tension I feel, my pinky covered in diamond rose
No pension, I'm finna go and buy my mom a Rolls
Tension I feel when I come offstage at my show
Tension I feel when I see someone that I know
Attention I feel when I wear Prada to my toes
Attention I feel when I'm surrounded by these hoes
[Verse 2]
Tension I feel when the plug don't pick up
Tension I feel when the sun comin' up
We be in the field, it ain't hard to find us
I'm chillin' at the top, you still tryna climb up
I feel tension every time I count up
Just to mention I'm grateful that they found us
They feel tension when they come around us
All this water, think the jeweler tryna drown us
Take half of the E, let her wear my rings
All my stones are fancy, be careful with these
Tension I feel when she don't give 'em back to me
Tension I feel when she don't suck me 'til I sleep

[Chorus]
Tension I feel when I go on the road
Got hittas that'll snip you down and grippin' on their pole
Tension I feel, my pinky covered in diamond rose
No pension, I'm finna go and buy my mom a Rolls
Tension I feel when I come offstage at my show
Tension I feel when I see someone that I know
Attention I feel when I wear Prada to my toes
Attention I feel when I'm surrounded by these hoes

[Outro]
They wasn't used to somebody that looks like me
(I feel tension)
Now you look at god
(Tension I feel, tension I feel)
Seeing the things I've seen, know what I'm sayin'?
(Tension I feel, tension I feel, I feel tension)
The music just come through, no matter what
(Tension I feel)
They ain't care what I looked like, they just care about the musicYou might also like5Embed
