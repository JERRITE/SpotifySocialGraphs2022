TranslationsEspa√±olYounger Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and I, used to walk the streets at night
Our parents didn't know, we kept the TV goin'
And left on all the bedroom lights
And no, I haven't seen you since we lost all our innocence
You left me in the dark while you drink in the park
I'll never be the same again

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me were so, so close
And maybe that's what hurts the most
It's out of my hands, I've done what I can
So I just save my breath
[Chorus]
Deep in my heart, I know that it's over
Deleted your number, so I can't call you
Call you my brother, the way that we used to
When we were younger, younger

[Verse 2]
I saw you just the other night
I didn't even recognize you
I find it kind of strange, I guess that people change
But I didn't expect you to

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me were so, so close
And maybe that's what hurts the most
It's out of my hands, I've done what I can
So I just save my breath

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart, I know that it's over
Deleted your number, so I can't call you
Call you my brother, the way that we used to
When we were younger, younger

[Bridge]
Tryna get in touch with you, I don't know where you've been
Have a conversation but you'll never let me in
I've tried, I've tried
I've tried with you a thousand times
Maybe I don't have to play the bad guy in the end
'Cause I've been trying hard enough to be a better friend
I've tried, I've tried
But we're out of time
You might also like[Chorus]
Deep in my heart, I know that it's over
Deleted your number so, I can't call you
My brother, the way that we used to
When we were younger, younger33Embed
