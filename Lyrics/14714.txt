Shots Remix Lyrics[Intro]
M1OnTheBeat

[Chorus: Morrisson]
My exes and friends weren't moving correct so I cut them off
A lot of you don't like me and I don't like you, so that's no love lost
It's use or get used out 'ere, and me I get used 'cause I'm useful
You get used less 'cause you're useless, it's an ugly game, but it's beautiful
Boy, if you ain't go no dough then pick up your phone and do some shots
Girl, if you've got no arse then you better go gym and do some squats
Small batty gyal in my DM, that's a instant decline, every ting lock 'arff
Pull up on me and my section, instant gunshot, every ting lock 'arff
[Verse 1: Morrisson]
Look at who just stepped in Morrisson
I've already bodied this track, right now it's a burial ting
I'm about to murder this rap game, just like I murdered the trap
I'm a rapper that'd kick off your door and have your crop in the air like Shmurda's hat
Free Bobby, we get a brick, we slap it, bag it and get it all sold
Let's talk green 'cause I get it in bulk, I'm the biggest green man since Incredible Hulk
If bro's got beef then I'm getting involved, kick down front doors and take them down
Put you up for your bags and boxes, then watch your blood turn my blade brown

[Verse 2: Bandokay]
Small batty gyal in my DM, catty, no, she ain't making me happy
Trigger finger slappy, no yard shop when we're looking for pattys, akhi
Lean out of that back seat gladly, jump out gang, jump out and just slappy
The opp boys can't mad me, feds can't stand me just 'cause I look like my daddy
Mad ting when I'm angry, man's angry, the feds locked down half of my family
This sweet one's tryna go on boujee, looking boujee, tryna go on anti
Yo miss, you look sweet, no candy, I like big guns, shotgun just handy
Bad B's tryna off her panty, keep her drawers on, I can't wait 'till my gang see

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Small batty gyal get lock 'arff, dotty get chop off, ride out proper
Bells for the shotgun but if a colour don't lack on your strip, catch corn in your upper
Fuck off, fuck off, dance get lock 'arff, twist this blade, push that in a sucker
Six in this spin, two in a brucker, them man disperse when we buck each other
Double Lz, I'm a sav', man's anti, slappy, four black yutes in ballys
Clappy, saucy driller in the back seat, athlete, catch up quick, it gets splashy
Slap the dots at your akhi, gladly, stuff the mash with two batteries
Free SJ, my bro's not a patty, we had two waps in the dinger, no cabby

Nuttin' but drills when they're mentioning me, how many drills have I done in a week?
Gang pull up, bare tape at the scene, how many souls am I taking with me?
Pull up, I drill and I'm out, opps over there, I'm shelling that crowd
Marvelous works, I didn't see trial, I'm getting bagged cah their fucking mouths
I'm tryna leave the opp block tented man, would've thought my opps went camping
Come like N Dubz with no regrets, any opp I got, I meant it
Fuck the judge and free all my guys, free all my guys dem sentenced
Heard he got hit with a chesty ones, gonna need more than Lemsip
Juggin' and drillin', belt hold two, it's spinning
Any type of beef, man winning, jeans and the crep, many tings just spinning
Crème to the crème , courtesy of whipping, my mum should've named me Kipling
Man down if I got the 4s on point, bought me the kways from the shelf, that's dipping
Bad B cattin' for the woodin'
She asked if the stories are true, I tell them that the proof's in the puddin'
Shoe box without no shoe, two feet in, man they got one foot in
Eliminate risk, no clues, ride with the Rambz but I might just whoosh him
Corn from the 10 so fat they took him

[Verse 5: V9]
Ayy, come here
Uplift him, when I rip it
They don't wanna feel this drilling (They don't)
Two Samurai's and kitchen, I mean Rambo knife, I'm just kidding
Dot-dot ain't missing, full stop to your life if I ping it
See red like a BBM message, grab that dots and fill him with pellets
I'm lurking
They don't wanna see me purging
Catch these yutes and hurt them, your old ones are wet, close the curtains
Touch my young boy in his head, and awaken him like Krillin
This car holds seven, but we stuff nine
You know we ain't good at maths, opp block, conquer and attack
Mad on my ones, don't need my batch, swing my Johnny and watch him plank
Ching mans neck and call him Titan, backroad drillings, do it in silence
I want man packed like parties, evacuate, keep it marching
V9 too devlish, slap man's sister for loving her brother
I'm on beef and dough like pie, don't think twice, you might die
Slap shots, stop squinting your eyes, you might just dead up tonight
Bill up a zeggy and get fried
[Verse 6: Snap Capone]
Get a whole brick, turn it to two, abracadabra
Score goals like Zaha, been on the field like Drogba
Still try and dodge me a copper
Still doing burger and lobster
You can tell I'm a G from my posture
The .44 long holds crayons
Rose gold bullets with your name on
Shoot-shoot-shoot 'till your brain's gone
Slap off the war with a K on
I don't turn off, I stay on
Might just put your bae on
You get a new pack, I'll buss you, you couldn't even tell it's been touched
I killed two niggas and shot twenty niggas and still ain't been touched
Excellent finish, clinical headshots
Feds caught night gloves, see red in my eyes like Cyclops
If I bang on your whip, that's a write off
If I ride to your block, that's a life lost
.44 long, oh my gosh
Trappin' ain't dead, my Encro buzzing, got bricks on lease
Me and Morrisson, two rap niggas that really put bricks on the streets

[Chorus: Morrisson]
My ex and some friends weren't moving correct so I cut them off
A lot of you don't like me and I don't like you, so that's no love lost
It's use and get used out 'ere, and me I get used 'cause I'm useful
You get used less 'cause you're useless, it's an ugly game, but it's beautiful
Boy, if you ain't go no dough then pick up your phone and do some shots
Girl, if you've got no arse then you better go gym and do some squats
Small batty gyal in my DM, that's a instant decline, every ting lock 'arff
Pull up on me and my section, instant gunshot, every ting lock 'arff2Embed
