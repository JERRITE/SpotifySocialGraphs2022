Iâ€™d Rather Be With You Lyrics[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
[Verse 1]
I'd rather be with you until I'm through
Oh yes, I do
I'd rather be with you until that day we'll fly away
I just love that smiling face in the early sun
If I can't have you to myself, then life's no fun
[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your hand
Oh, if I can just be your man
I wanna be your friend
Not now and then, but until the end
I just love the way you act, and that's a fact
I wanna be your number one, so get to that

[Bridge]
Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time
Maybe the next time

Yeah, I'd rather be with you
Yeah
Yeah, I'd rather be with you

[Verse 3]
I'd rather be with you until I'm through
Oh yes, I do
I'd rather be with you until that day we'll fly away
I just love that smiling face in the early sun
If I can't have you to myself, then life's no fun

[Outro]
Well, uh, you might think I'm trying to be funny
But I'm really serious this time, baby
(I'd rather be with you, yeah)
Even though, uh, it's a cold world, baby
But you know deep down inside that I do love ya
(I'd rather be with you, yeah)
I know I sound strange, but I really mean it
We gon' make it this time, baby
(I'd rather be with you, yeah)
You're the only one I really love now
I'm coming at you with both hands tied behind my back, baby
(I'd rather be with you, yeah)
You got me, I'm coming at you, get ready
I'm gonna stick my love in your eye, baby
(I'd rather be with you, yeah)
You can see me coming, baby, just coming all over you
(Yeah I'd rather be with you)10Embed
