Sugar Daddy LyricsI've got a sweet tooth
For licorice drops and jelly roll
Hey Sugar Daddy
Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl
I'll lay out fine china on the linen
And polish up the chrome
If you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy bring it home

Black strap molasses
You're my orange blossom honey bear
Bring me Versace blue jeans
And black designer underwear
We'll dress up like the disco-dancing jet set
In Milan and Rome
If you got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy bring it home
Oh the thrill of control
Like the rush of rock and roll
It's the sweetest taste I've known
If you've got some sugar bring it home

When honey bees go shopping
It's something to be seen
They swarm to wild flowers
And get nectar for the queen
And every thing you bring me
Got me dripping like a honeycomb
And if you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home

Oh the thrill of control
Like a Blitzkrieg on the roll
It's the sweetest taste I've known
So if you've got some sugar
Bring it home
Oh come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home!

Whiskey and French cigarettes
A motorbike with high- speed jets
A Waterpik, a Cuisinart
And a hypo-allergenic dog
Oh, I want all the luxuries of the modern age
And every item on every page
In the Lillian Vernon catalogue

Luther: Oh baby, something's crossed my mind
I was thinking you'd look so fine
In a velvet dress
With heels and an ermine stole
Hansel: Oh, Luther darling, heaven knows
I've never put on women's clothes!
Except for once
My mother's camisole

So you think only a woman
Can truly love a man
Then you buy me the dress
I'll be more woman than a man like you can stand
I'll be your Venus on a chocolate clam shell
Rising on a sea of marshmallow foam
And if you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home

It's our tradition to control
Like Erich Honecker and Helmut Kohl, [remember him?]
From the Ukraine to the Rhone
Sweet home uber alles
Lord, I'm coming home
So come on, Sugar Daddy, bring me homeEmbed
