Lose My Cool (Franc Moody Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
I was so full of pain, just stuck in my head
There was no way for me to get over it
So I kept it bottled up all inside of me
'Til I felt the pressure I could no longer breath

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know I'm feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes, I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool
Feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes, I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool
[Bridge]
I've got to lose my cool now baby
I've got to lose my cool now darling
I may act a fool now baby, yeah
I've got to lose my cool

[Chorus]
Yeah, you know I'm feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes, I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool
Feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes, I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool

[Outro]
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool
I've got to lose my cool
