Used to Like Lyrics[Verse 1]
If only you were lonely
Maybe I was holy
We could be together
Bending over backwards
You become an actor
Be my thrill forever

[Pre-Chorus]
You once told me I was all you had
I guess I know life and it doesn't work like that
[Chorus]
Oh, honey, now you're sayin' I'm acting crazy
And I don't see what you see
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Highs so high, drinks for free
Let's go to extremes
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If only you were lonely
Maybe you would show me
We could be together
Playing make-believe lies
You could never play nice
Be my thrill forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I once told you you were all I had
I guess I know life and it doesn't work like that

[Chorus]
Oh, honey, now you're sayin' I'm acting crazy
And I don't see what you see
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Highs so high, drinks for free
Let's go to extremes
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Bridge]
Take it back, take it back, take it back now
Used to being lonely
Take it back, take it back, take it back now
Never good at being holy
Never good at being holy

[Chorus]
Oh, honey, now you're sayin' I'm acting crazy
And I don't see what you see
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Highs so high (Highs so high), drinks for free (Drinks for free)
Let's go to extremes (Let's go)
Get back to what you used to like about me
Back to what you used to like about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
