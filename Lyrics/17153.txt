Lane Changing Lyrics[Intro: Lul G]
RBE, SOB man that's the gang man
Fuck you sucka's
For you other niggas, I ain't fuckin' wit'
(RBESOB that's the gang bitch!)

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
What you fuck niggas sayin'?
Glock in the party, I be strapped like a gay bitch
Niggas lane changin', don't know where they lane is
I carry big bills, nah nigga I ain't changin'
Slide down, lil' nigga that's a trespass
Named the whip Ralph, with them straps we'll wreck that
Throw a dime with the Glock, like a chest pass
A nigga run up, big shells where his legs at
Strictly Only Brothers, if you not you irrelevant
Big clips longer than the trunk of an elephant
A nigga stressed out, pourin' fours for the medicine
Circle like a dot, where a white bitch freckles is
Get paid, fuck beef, nigga, get paid
Cops come, lil' bro, switch lanes
Uppercase, young nigga tote a big K
And all our guns hoes, run up, nigga, get laid
[Verse 2: Lul G]
Speakin' down on a nigga, you a ho, nigga (You a bitch)
Why you lyin', actin' like you totin' poles, nigga (You ain't)
Catch you lackin', guarantee it's a score, nigga (Boom Boom)
Talkin' all that cash shit, but you broke, nigga (You Broke)
Watch we send fucks out to some fuck niggas (You a bitch)
Learn the sound when them hollows get to bust, nigga (Boom Boom)
Some nigga's gettin' visits, others is missin'
All you hear is body droppin' and them the cuffs click
SOB the gang, all my niggas with the shit
I'll bust at a opp, and i'll bust at a bitch
No drive-by's 'cause my niggas tryna' scope
Young nigga with the shred, 'cause you trippin' with the pole (Tear It Off)
Shit real in these streets, you gotta play it right
Don't let the bitch be the reason why you lose yo' life
Never lyin' on this shit, I'ma tell the truth
I ain't gon' rock wit' that booty if I ain't gon' shoot

[Verse 3: Slimmy B]
These niggas can't stand us
LOL for what though?
'Cause we the reason nigga's main bitches gettin' fucked on
Keep a small circle, new niggas, I can't trust those
These bitches fuck whoever bill's bigger, so it's fuck hoes
I go down and they get me in that room, I'm on hush-mode
North Vallejo turf nigga, Crestside, cutthroat
XD, Gleekos, Dracos we bust those
And every nigga that I call brother, I'll bust for
Shooter's everywhere, get you smacked for a band
Leanin' off this two-liter Sprite, thank the cough-man
Fuck talkin', slide through and get to sparkin'
This funk, will have you niggas MIA like the Dolphins
SOB the gang, we the niggas talkin' cash shit
G got that 'K, quick to make a nigga backflip
Woodgrain chop, but I'm rockin' wit' this plastic
And money blue or green, I'll get it out a fat bitch, nigga!

Ever since day one, I been the same nigga
Please, don't, confuse me for a lame nigga
Thirty shot's in that Glock, wit' no aim, nigga
Eleven shot's in that stock, sprayin' paint, nigga
Circle got small, I can't trust niggas
Bitch, I been a hot nigga since a young nigga
Took a loss, but you neva' seen me run, nigga
Thought I'm dumb, nigga, 'till his face meet this drum, nigga
Ten-deep in the foreign, ridin' back to back
Catch a opp-nigga slippin', runnin' lap to lap
All blue's in my loaf, nigga, stack to stack
And she gon' do all my bro's, nigga, back to back
Ha, yeah, niggas know the gang, nigga
Talk shit when it's diamonds in yo chain, nigga?
All-chrome thirty-twos, had to tuck that
Two-tone .380, had to bust that
Upgraded to that Glock, bitch, don't touch that
And it ain't on my hip if I won't bust that
Clutchin' in the party, nigga, clutch back
Put that barrel to his face, blow his buff's back
Make a nigga strip like a thot, bitch
Call that chop Ray Rice, how it drop shit
Doin' pop-ups, mom's house, TEC shots, two Glocks, headshots, Young Money "Bed Rock"
Man's turned on me, so he gotta catch a leg shot
Fuck cops, fuck opps, .40 in the tuck spot
Bitches want a nigga off they fame, I can't trust thots
SOB the gang, wit' more chops than a gunshop, bitch
[Outro: Lul G]
Ahh, 30s, 50s, 100s, bitch, we got 'em
Bitch, we been gettin' money
Talk shit when it's diamonds in yo' chain, bitch
SOB the gang, bitch8Embed
