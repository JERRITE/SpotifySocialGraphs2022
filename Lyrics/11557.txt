I Donâ€™t Wanna Be Funny Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too-short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
Is there room in the band? I don't need to be the front man
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan
[Verse 3]
I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist

[Bridge]
Try not to laugh
I know it'll be hard
I'm serious
I know it's a first but

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Yeah, I'll be the gossip, hear it through the grapevine
Pass it on, she's done with the old times
That funny girl doesn't wanna smile for a whileYou might also like3Embed
