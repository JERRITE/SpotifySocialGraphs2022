Staring at the Ceiling Lyrics[Intro]
Staring at the ceiling

[Verse 1]
When I, I lie awake at night
I get upset, I wonder why
Try not to cry
Try again, try again, but no reply
Tell myself: "Write it down"
"Ok, cry it out"
'Cause what is there left to talk about?
Phone a friend, then hang up
Before they pick it up
I'm losing my mind tonight
[Chorus]
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
About to fall apart, you didn't mean it
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at the ceiling
I lie awake at night just daydreaming
Deleting memories, I don't need them
This is what it feels like staring at thе ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at thе ceiling

[Post-Chorus]
This is what it feels like, this is what it feels like
Staring at the ceiling
This is what it feels like

[Verse 2]
When I, I wanna close my eyes
They're like the stars up in the sky
I try (All night) all night
Try again, try again, they won't align
Tell myself it's okay
Don't like you anyway (Anyway)
But I know I'll change my mind again
Suddenly yesterday seems so far away (Far away)
I hope you reply tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
About to fall apart, you didn't mean it
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at the ceiling
I lie awake at night just daydreaming
Deleting memories, I don't need them
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at the ceiling

[Post-Chorus]
This is what it feels like, this is what it feels like
Staring at the ceiling
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling

[Bridge]
And I, I lay awake at night, staring at the ceiling
(Try again, try again, try again, try again)
I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
About to fall apart, you didn't mean it
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at the ceiling
I lie awake at night just daydreaming
Deleting memories, I don't need them
This is what it feels like staring at the ceiling
Staring at the ceiling, staring at the ceiling
[Outro]
(Staring at the, starting at the, staring at the ceiling)
(Staring at the, starting at the, staring at the ceiling)
(Staring at the, starting at the, staring at the ceiling)3Embed
