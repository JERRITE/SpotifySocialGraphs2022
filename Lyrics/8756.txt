Wilbury Twist Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom Petty, All]
You put your hand on your head (Hand on your head)
Put your foot in the air (Foot in the air)
Then you hop around the room (Hop around the room)
In your underwear (In your underwear)
There ain't never been nothing quite like this
Come on, baby, it's The Wilbury Twist

[Verse 2: George Harrison, All]
Lift your other foot up (Other foot up)
And fall on your ass (Fall on your ass)
Get back up (Get back up)
Put your teeth in a glass (Teeth in a glass)
Ain't never been nothing quite like this
It's a magical thing called The Wilbury Twist
[Chorus: All]
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist
China, Belgium, France, Japan
Thailand, Poland, Pakistan
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist

[Verse 3: Jeff Lynne, All]
Roll up your rug (Roll up your rug)
Dust your broom (Dust your broom)
Ball the jack (Ball the jack)
Howl at the moon (At the moon)
Ain't ever been nothing quite like this
Everybody's talking 'bout The Wilbury Twist

[Chorus: All]
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist
Puerto Rico, U.S.A
England, Cameroon, Norway
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist

[Verse 4: Tom Petty, All]
Turn your lights down low (Your lights down low)
Put your blindfold on (Your blindfold on)
You'll never know (You'll never know)
When your friends have gone (When your friends have gone)
It could be years before you're missed
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist
You might also like[Verse 5: Bob Dylan, All]
It's a different dance (Different dance)
For you all to do (For you all to do)
Spin your body (Very versatile)
Like a screw (Spin your body like a screw)
Better not forget it on your shopping list
(You can stop and buy one, it's The Wilbury Twist)

[Outro: George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, All]
Ain't never been nothing quite like this
(Better come and get it, it's The Wilbury Twist)
I guess by now you've got the gist
(Everybody's crazy about The Wilbury Twist)Embed
