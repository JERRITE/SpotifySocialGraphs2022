This Feels Right Lyrics(Recording of Frank Zappa on Larry King Interview 1989)

"I say this: if lyrics on records could produce the kinds of negative results that certain people claim they produce, then take this example: most of the records which are broadcasted on the radio are songs about love. Ninety-nine percent is about love. And all we hear on the radio is love. So if the lyrics were impressing our society what would we have here: Disneyland. But we donâ€™t."

[Verse]

You ain't a regular
Baby you like a nebula
You see the world like I see it
We're both irregular
You got me feeling like
I popped x twice
And all I did was hold your hand
Yeah that "pop kiss" nice
Uh a little coffee with a conversation
Girl you take my breath away
Talk about a confiscation
Uh I'm just tryina make an observation
I've been waiting long enough
I think it's time for confirmation

I know I told the Lord that all I need is strength and patience
I guess that's why he wrote your name in each one of my pages
I'm the type of nigga that'll never talk to strangers
Cause I know how much relations can be dangerous but

[Hook]

You got a nigga wondering
What them lips feel like
You got a nigga wondering
If you're Mrs. Right
And baby this feels right
If loving you is wrong
I'll be wrong tonight (x2)

[Verse]

You ain't materialistic
You like the small things
You think I'm realistic
Cause I see the whole thing
You might also likeBut when I look at you
I swear that everything doesn't look so blue
When I look at you
The whole world stops and I feel so good

It feels so natural
Guess that we're just compatible
Really I'm thinking lateral
Love isn't really tangible
But I can feel it
No longer wanna conceal it
And if you're in need of healing
Then let me show you what I can do

I ain't a doctor
But baby I got some patience
No 9 to 5 but I still be making them paychecks
Don't need commitment but I could be his replacement
Move you out of that basement
I could give you a face lift

I got you smiling
Like I put your ass in clown school
Can't remember how we met
But I'm so glad I found you
Cause I used to feel
Like ain't nobody real enough for me
Then I met you got to know ya
And I really got to see

The side that you were hiding
Where nobody got invited
But you let me get inside it
Cause you got some trust in me

[Hook]

You got a nigga wondering
What them lips feel like
You got a nigga wondering
If you're Mrs. Right
And baby this feels right
If loving you is wrong
I'll be wrong tonight (x2)

[Verse]

Ain't too many that are like you
So I had to go and make a move
Got a quick reply then I replied
"Do you miss me" cause I do

You said you wanted me next to you
Like a coma, got inside the Impala
When you texted me, "come through"

I really like that you trust me just like a partner
I know we could go farther
I feel like it could come true

You never ask for a dollar
And give your two cents
You like to smoke marijuana
Go with the movements

You like the music
And tell me how to improve it
Everything that you do is
Drawing me close to you

[Hook]

You got a nigga wondering
What them lips feel like
You got a nigga wondering
If you're Mrs. Right
And baby this feels right
If loving you is wrong
I'll be wrong tonightEmbed
