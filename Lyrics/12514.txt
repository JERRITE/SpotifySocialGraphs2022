I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo Lyrics[Intro]
Sold my bed
Sold my, sold my
Sold my bed
Sold my...

[Verse 1]
Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
Blank tapes and posters on the door
Listen to my Pink Floyd cover
Take a seat like a backbeat lover
Mixed tapes and cushions on the floor
[Chorus]
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo

[Post-Chorus]
Sold my bed
Sold my, sold my

[Verse 2]
Paper bags and escalators
Pushing up those broken faders
Only way to find out who you are
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero
Little things will always get you far

[Chorus]
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo (Sold my, sold my)
I sold my bed, but not my stereo

[Bridge]
Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero
You might also like[Chorus]
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo (Sold my bed)
I sold my bed, but not my stereo (Sold my bed)
I sold my bed, but not my stereo5Embed
