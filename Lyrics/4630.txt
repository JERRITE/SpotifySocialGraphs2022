Straight & Tall Lyrics[Intro]
Mr. Ten08
Blockworks

[Chorus]
To a track from a team into a baseball
Now I cut up two hundred eighty-eight eightballs
Know some real niggas in the pen, free 8Ball
Blew up in the Tenn' like MJG & 8Ball
Done seen more bricks than China stacked in the Great Wall
On my third strike, it's just a friendly game of baseball
Been having motion with the pills, cocaine and dog
All of my soldiers in the field grew up straight and tall
All of my soldiers in the field stood up straight and tall
[Verse 1]
The memoirs of a orca, we who ate the sharks
Call me Gemstar 'cause a nigga cut razor sharp
Big 227 patriarch
Took the panties off the pint, had her showing all her lady parts
We done went digital, my nigga, talking state of art
These niggas ain't no killer whales, them some baby sharks
Pocket like a loan shark, finna take the charts
Thousand-dollar Chrome Heart hoodie, I be breaking hearts
This Heartbreak Hotel and I'm the hitman
Told my teacher when I grow up, I'ma be the brick man
Big Creature, niggas know that we some pigpens
Puzzle piecin' out a jigsaw down in St. Paul
May the best man win, winner takes all
May the best man win, winner takes all
I pray my left-hand spin if they take me off
Make sure that my son know that I always stood up straight and tall

[Chorus]
To a track from a team into a baseball
Now I cut up two hundred eighty-eight eightballs
Know some real niggas in the pen, free 8Ball
Blew up in the Ten' like MJG & 8Ball
Done seen more bricks than China stacked in the Great Wall
On my third strike, it's just a friendly game of baseball
Been having motion with the pills, cocaine and dog
All of my soldiers in the field grew up straight and tall

Catch your pops at the Valero, I was selling dope
Big can, barrel look like the back of a telescope
Weather the storm, had the shivers, damaging my liver
Had to plow through the snowstorm, now my neck a blizzard
Three Hundiddy Bop Bop if I press the issue
You respect the nigga got shot, we respect who hit you
Beam on the cyclops, I'll thread the needle
Big Creature like I'm Sasquatch with this Desert Eagle
I hit a nigga flush dead in his bald spot
From where we treat the blue and whites like some mall cops
My fans double bunk in beds on the compound
I'm just tryna stay the fuck out of the way, my dawg

[Chorus]
To a track from a team into a baseball
Now I cut up two hundred eighty-eight eightballs
Know some real niggas in the pen, free 8Ball
Blew up in the Ten' like MJG & 8Ball
Done seen more bricks than China stacked in the Great Wall
On my third strike, it's just a friendly game of baseball
Been having motion with the pills, cocaine and dog
All of my soldiers in the field grew up straight and tall
All of my soldiers in the field stood up straight and tall

[Outro]
Make sure this is straight when I get there bro

Please stay the fuck out the way, man, alright?

When you matter, everything you do matters, nigga
