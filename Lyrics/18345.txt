Mama Stay Lyrics[Intro: Haile]
Na, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy
Na, na-na, na-na, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy
In my zone, ayy, yeah, yeah
Na, na-na, na-na, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na, na-na, na-na, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Haile]
We runnin' in circles, you need diamonds
And all my devotion
We can make some moments
Show me that you're for me
You're the bag so secure yourself
Don't switch up, I got big plans
In my VIP, no wristband
When we rolling I ain't never need a wingman
[Verse 1: Akelle Charles]
We could chill if you wanna
Or you can find me by the corner store
I be chillin' with the ballers
Same me just a little bit taller, yeah
See mama (See mama)
We be flyin' all over the sеa, mama (Sea, mama)
You're the girl I was seein' in my drеam, mama (Dream, mama)
From your hair right down to your feet dun up
You can see that it's
Your lovin' and my thuggin'
When I'm clutching on my ting
They're basic and I'm famous, they can't say shit to my ting

[Chorus: Haile, Akelle Charles]
While she's rockin' my diamonds
And all my devotion
We can make some moments
Show me that you're for me
You're the bag so secure yourself
Don't switch up, I got big plans
In my VIP, no wristband
When we rolling I ain't never need a wingman (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus: Haile]
Mama stay, you can stay if you wanna (Hey, hey, hey)
Far away, mama stay if you wanna (Hey, hey, hey)
Mama stay, you can stay if you wanna (Hey, hey, hey)
Far away, mama stay if you wanna (Hey, hey, hey)
