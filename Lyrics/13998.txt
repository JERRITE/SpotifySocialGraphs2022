Bide Your Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam Fray]
The temptation is all too great
To know it's gone and it's all too late
I tried and I tried, I never applied
To any of the morals that I wish I had
You wait fifty whole weeks
Through all of your hides and all of your seeks
When the time finally arrives
It dawns on me that, the tension derives
From the girlfriend that you left at home
Sitting in the living room all alone
[Chorus]
You hate the suntan
And you can't stand to be around the short sleeved man
And the gaggle of girls who are singing too loud
Well, they do my head in
You hate the tattoos
And you can't handle the skinheads, the ones who cannot handle the booze
They're making you scared to be proud
Are you scared to be proud?
How can that still be?
Come and sing your heart out with me

[Refrain]
But if you, bide your time
And you stand there and you wait in line
It won't be long before her sarong is lying on your bedroom floor
But what about the girlfriend that you left at home
Sitting in the living room all alone

[Chorus]
You hate the suntan
And you can't stand to be around the short sleeved man
And the gaggle of girls who are singing too loud
Well, they do my head in
You hate the tattoos
And you can't handle the skinheads, the ones who cannot handle their booze
They're making you scared to be proud
How is that still allowed?
You're scared to be proud
When you're on cloud number nine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And the girlfriend that you left at home
Sitting in the living room all alone

[Chorus]
You hate the suntan
And you can't stand to be around the short sleeved man
And the gaggle of girls who are singing too loud
They fucking do my head in
You hate the tattoos
And you can't handle the skinheads, the ones who cannot handle their booze
They're making you scared to be proud
Are you scared to be proud allowed?
How is that still allowed?
When you're on cloud number nineEmbed
