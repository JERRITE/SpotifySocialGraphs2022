Green Utopia Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do ya wanna hit the gutter?
Little lover, say you love me
But the city is a pity
There’s a pretty way it can be

[Chorus]
Baby turn around (Yeah)
Under silver cloud (Yeah)
See the mystic sun (Shine on)
Green utopia (My love)
Green, green utopia
[Verse 2]
Do ya wanna smoke another?
In a leather make my heart beat
But the people, pretty evil
There’s a real place that I need

[Chorus]
6,5,4,3,2,1
Baby turn around (Yeah)
Under silver cloud (Yeah)
See the mystic sun (Shine on)
Green utopia (My love)
Green, green utopia

[Bridge]
I don’t need what I never got
I believe anything I want
Follow me through another world
Evergreen, let the city burn

[Chorus]
Baby turn around (Yeah)
Under silver cloud (Yeah)
See the mystic sun (Shine on)
Green utopia (My love)
Green, green utopia

Green, green utopia
Green, green utopia
Green, green utopiaEmbed
