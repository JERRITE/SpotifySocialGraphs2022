DIP N DRIP Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everytime when I walk in
Everyone come crawling
Callin' me darlin’
They start talkin’

Look at her walkin’
Look at her whippin'
Look at her dippin’
Look at her drippin’
I whip it around when I dip and dip and I drip with ambition
I’m in my prime and I drip and I drip 'til I get my commission

Look at me walkin’
Look at me whippin'
Look at me dippin’
Look at me drippin’

[Pre-Chorus]
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I dip and I dip and I dip and I

[Chorus]
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I drip and I drip and I drip with ambition

[Verse]
Everytime when I walk in
Everyone come crawling
Callin me darlin’
They start talkin’

[Pre-Chorus]
Whеn I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
When I dip and I drip, dip and I drip
