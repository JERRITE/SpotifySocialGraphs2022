She Loves My Cock LyricsSee the bird on the barstool looking for a jerk
If she likes the way he looks, she'll put his ass to work
And you know she's been all around the block
She's tried a doctor, lawyer, even tried a jock
But she loves my cock

Loves my cock
She loves my cock
Loves my cock
She loves my cock
Ain't no need to change it, that's just the way it is
Got to find a bigger jerk, she got to have his jizz
And you know she's been around the block
She's tried a doctor, lawyer, even tried a jock
But she loves my cock

Loves my cock
She loves my cock
Loves my cock
She loves my cock

There's as many hands on her as the knob on the door
She's such a pretty, pretty, pretty little whore
To get my cock, she'd walk through the flames of hell
'Cause I can always tell when she's coming
I can always tell

Loves my cock
She loves my cock
Loves my cock
She loves my cockYou might also likeEmbed
