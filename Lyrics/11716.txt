​dancing around Lyrics[Chorus]
I can't wait
I’ve been longing to be dancing around again
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again

[Verse 1]
I wish for the madness
I live a bit lavish
But you don’t care besides
And I'll be
Living this freely
And governing sadness
With a watchful eye
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll deal with restraint
He wanted me dead
Wish somebody
Told me it's all in my head

[Chorus]
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again

[Verse 2]
I’ll take it out in me
What cages ambition
That reaches out far

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll deal with restraint
He wanted me dead
Wish somebody
Told me it's all in my head

[Chorus]
I can’t wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again
You might also like[Bridge]
Dancing around again

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll deal with restraint
He wanted me dead
Wish somebody
Told me it's all in my head

[Chorus]
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around again
I can't wait
I've been longing to be dancing around againEmbed
