Triptych Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keeping you awake, keeping you awake on purpose
Hey, did I make a mistake and do my mistakes worsen?
I would give it up to every man I love
I take what I can get
And every woman too, I would too
That's my only secret left

[Pre-Chorus]
I will entertain your feet or your hands for a triptych
Sell me at the Strand on the stands for a fat brick
I get what I want, and your girlfriend too
Make a predator of me
[Chorus]
I'll be good to you
(I'm worth it)
(I'm worth it)

[Verse 2]
So before I turn it off, little light at my bedstand
Ask me what I thought of the life that I led and
I'll take off your pants, say goodnight to the ears there
Put you where I sing in the light in the damp air

[Chorus]
And I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm the moving mouth, moving mouth with my eyes closed
Breathing an excuse, breathing loose through my new nose
I will buy a round on your dime like I used to
Feeding you my cake, you my cake, eating it too

[Chorus]
I'll be good to you
I'll be good to youYou might also like2Embed
