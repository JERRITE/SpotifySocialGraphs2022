Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
She said she ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
I ain't never comin' back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put you on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than, see you leave just like the rest
(See you leave just like the rest)
Damn

[Interlude: Jeffrey Dahmer]
It made me feel like they were a permanent part of me, besides the mere curiosity of what it would be...

[Verse 2: Yung Goth]
Lately, I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately, I've been dyin' lately
Lately, lately, lately, I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately, I've been dyin' lately
Lately, lately, I've been dyin' lately
Gettin' high lately, gettin' high lately
Lately, baby, please don’t worry, baby
Always tryna blame me, you ain't tryna save me
Save me, lately, gettin' high, tasty
Now I'm on that lame shit, I've been dyin' lately
Lately, baby
