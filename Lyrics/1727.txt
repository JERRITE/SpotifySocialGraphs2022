Habaesha Lyrics[Intro:]
It's Ramrico Suave
Bailandoooo

[Hook]
Met an East African on the weekend
From the East End
Softest skin – with a waist so slim
She don't need collagen in her cheeks and shawty fleeking
And that ass on ten, hot cayenne
Bailen, bailen, bailen, bailando
[Bridge]
She my habaesha, bad bish uh
Habaesha, bad bish uh
Habaesha, bad bish uh
Habaesha, bad bish uh
I told her yene fikir just to dick her
I told her yene fikir just to dick her down

[Verse 1]
So thick, so brown
Baby make my head spin 'round
Way she bounce her nyash oh
Up down, imma bounce your nyash oh
Bounce it baby
Girl you're too Konjo
Made me come close
I lose control
When you baile lento

[Bridge]
Bailando, bailando
Losing control, I can't handle
Girl, bailando, bailando

[Verse 2]
Salaam, they call me Ram
But you can call me Ramy, madame
Girl I know you want this banane
But imma pass it off to Jaegen
Let me beat it up like Jaegen
She say I'm a gyalis
But babe for you I talk to gyal less
You make me be a better man
You take me high, hope I never land
I don't need no xan to zen with you
Used to be vans, caravans with you
Now it's new Jordans, Beamer, Benz with you
Girl I got a plan, got plans with you
