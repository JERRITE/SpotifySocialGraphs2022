Mmm-hmm

[Verse 1: Jesy]
You used to tell me that you loved me once
What happened? What happened?
Where is all of this coming from?
What happened? What happened?
You say I'm crazy and there's nothing wrong
You're lyin' and you know I know
Baby, what have we become?
What happened?
[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]
We used to never go to bed angry
But it's all we ever do lately
And you're turning away like you hate me
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh

[Chorus: Perrie]
You can take this heart
Heal it or break it all apart
No, this isn't fair
Love me or leave me here

[Post-Chorus: Perrie]
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here, oh

[Verse 2: Jade]
Do you remember when you loved me once?
What happened? What happened?
And you'd hold me here just because
What happened? No

[Pre-Chorus: Jade]
We used to never go to bed angry
But it's all we ever do lately
You're turning away like you hate me
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh
You might also like[Chorus: Perrie]
You can take this heart
Heal it or break it all apart
No, this isn't fair
Love me or leave me here

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie]
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here
[Bridge: Jade]
And love me, baby, please
'Cause I could still be the only one you need
The only one close enough to feel you breathe
Yeah, I could still be that place where you run
Instead of the one that you're running from, oh

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
You can take this heart
Heal it or break it all apart
No, this isn't fair
Love me or leave me here

[Post-Chorus: All, Leigh-Anne]
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Love me or leave me here44Embed
