Heat Wave Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of moving on
Spending every weekend so far gone
Heat wave, nothing to do
Woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you

[Verse 2]
Swirl in the white evening sun
Tell me that I'm the only one
And I hope I never get a clue
Green eyes, I don't know what to do
[Chorus]
And I hope whoever it is
Holds their breath around you
'Cause I know I did
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

[Verse 3]
Passing phases wear you thin
Same old world that you've been sleeping in
And I hope it never spends you up
Green eyes, what could ever be enough?

[Chorus]
And I hope the love that you find
Swallows you wholly
Like you said it might
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

[Outro]
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimesYou might also like9Embed
