Somewhere Somehow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I let it go
Sometimes I keep it real
Sometimes I make it up
Sometimes I freak the fuck out
I never know quite what to say
Sometimes I nail it anyway
I never know just what to do
I'm trying to make the best of you

[Chorus]
If I had my way
I'd have you right now
I wouldn't wait for someday
Somewhere, somehow
If I had my way
I'd have you right now
I wouldn't wait for someday
Somewhere, somehow
[Verse 2]
You look so good in all that power
But you won't mind if I have it back
I thought that you could handle me
But now I see you're just a man
I may not know quite what to say
So let me put it this way:
I do not care just what you do
I know I'll make the best of you

[Chorus]
If I had my way
I'd have you right now
I wouldn't wait for someday
Somewhere, somehow
If I had my way
I'd have you right now
I wouldn't wait for someday
Somewhere, somehowYou might also like2Embed
