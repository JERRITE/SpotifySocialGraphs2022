I Want You Anyway Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gave up a long time ago
Trying to find love
TV told me it was like the movies
But it never was
I couldn't beat it or join it
So, I just avoided it
Come what may
Then you came

[Chorus]
And I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna let you break my heart
I wanna feel the way it feels to make you stay
And I know you'll bring me to my knees
I know you're way out of my league
I know I can't afford the price I'm gonna pay
But I want you anyway
[Verse 2]
It's so self-betrayal of me
I'm about to say all the things
I swore I'd never say
My heart's in my mind
Drawing lines I can't erase
And all of a sudden
All that wasn't
So beautifully is
When we, kiss

[Chorus]
And I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna let you break my heart
I wanna feel the way it feels to make you stay
And I know you'll bring me to my knees
I know you're way out of my league
I know I can't afford the price I'm gonna pay
But I want you anyway

[Bridge]
The way the light hangs off you
I never stood a chance
See, you changed every plan I had with one glance

[Chorus]
And I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna let you break my heart
I wanna feel the way it feels to make you stay
And I know you'll bring me to my knees
I know you're way out of my league
I know I can't afford the price I'm gonna pay
But I want you anywayYou might also likeEmbed
