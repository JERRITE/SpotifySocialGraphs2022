Kiss Me, Kill Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you inhale money, do you ever think of me?
When you're running around to escape from the sound of my voice
It was perfect pain, but we're not in love
'Cause you're running around to escape from the sound of my voice
You can kiss me, darling
You can lay it on thick and make it hurt, a lot
But trust me I wouldn't miss it for a minute
You couldn't pay me enough to leave you behind

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe I'll go alone
Why can't you play along?
[Chorus]
You're like heavy sunshine
It hurts my eyes
I'm begging you to hurt me
If you wanted you could kill me
Maybe you could kiss me, but you'll kill me
Kiss me, kill me

[Verse 2]
When you exhale money, do you ever think of me?
You're not running around, do you still feel profound?
And worthy of the attention you got?
You know they love you
Trust me if you can't sleep you know I got you
I'll haunt your dreams until it'll wake you up

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know it's me?
Does it make you wanna kill me?

[Extended Chorus]
You're like heavy sunshine
It hurts my eyes
I'm begging you to hurt me
If you wanted you could kill me
Maybe you could kiss me, but you'll kill me
You're like heavy sunshine
It hurts my eyes
I'm begging you to hurt me
If you wanted you could kill me
Maybe you could kiss me, but you'll kill me
Kiss me, kill meYou might also like1Embed
