Expectations Lyrics[Verse 1: 6LACK]
You expect me to know, a lot of shit that I'm just out here tryna figure out
You expect me to know the answer to some shit that I'm just tryna get up out of
Where did the time, where did the time go?
I'm in the paint, tryna be Rondo
Of course, you got the answers, 'cause you ain't the one that's in my position

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now
[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, the winter is here, depression is triplin'
Nobody give a shit, I'm gettin' bread
Industry really be killin' my niggas
Guess entertainment business yin and the yang
Wait, I'm not the same, I can't find no peace
I sacrifice my world to a world that ignore me
Black man in therapy, 'cause white terror don't sleep
I got to roll up my leaf, might stop the PTSD
Carried away, bitches break up with you if you don't break
Niggas is lame, nigga my drive ain't the same
Of course you irate, it's a Wraith
On God, I got some reason to wear my head down (Head down)
Pray all my odds be even 'cause it get hard
And I follow what I feel, but that's the issue (Issue)
My thoughts can be deceivin' if they get a warm welcome

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now

[Refrain: Wale]
And on God, she got some reason to wear her head down (Head down)
Pray all her odds be even 'cause it get hard
And she follow what she feel, and that's the issue (Issue)
My thoughts can be deceivin', my thoughts can be deceivin'

Summer approachin', she look in the mirror, she wish it was winter
Her tummy is pokin'
Lookin' at Instagram, makin' you sick
Yeah, the figure you're fishin' for ain't in the ocean, no
Your potential is more than gold
Expectations is bogus though
Talk about what the eye don't see, this is body dysmorphia
Most of these pseudo-celebrities ain't really beautiful as you could ever be
Talkin', the tannin', and bleachin'
And all the procedures that make you go think that you not a queen
I ain't judgin', just bein' real, if the silicone help your anxiety
If I like you enough I'ma foot the bill
But you do it for you shorty, not for me
That's the cycle that she repeat
All the models she following livin' sweet
But the body she like doesn't come for cheap
She will live under knife, for the infamy
But who am I to judge?
I got my own problems, so I am not the one
When things get dark, I be in my own mind
So even in the crowd I'll be moreso alone
It's like, yo

[Break: Wale]
It's like me
It's like us
It's like her
It's like you
It's like us
[Chorus: 6LACK]
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now4Embed
