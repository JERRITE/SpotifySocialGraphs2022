Bacon & Eggs Lyrics[Intro]
They already know man (they know man)
That's enough of me explainin'
They know when they gonna see the video, they gonna be sad
I wishin' we coulda got down with them, damn
You damn right, wishin' you coulda got down with us

[Verse 1]
Yeah
God is in the details
I bought the Supreme resale
Bacon & Eggs, my whole team finna eat well
Hate to see me win, they would rather see the dream fail
I float away as I inhale
I watch a cigarette smoke sky fall over the beach
Break it down as I reach for the Backwood leaf
Take a drag, let the tide wash over my feet
And in this moment, I'm feelin complete
My 1980's Mercedes Benz is lookin' clean
Sippin' juice and gin in the 'preme playboy letterman
Rollin up doja
Pint of Hennessey tucked in the cup holder
Just a young soldier
Product of Johnny Knoxville and David Chappelle
Take a pull off the bottle and I face the L
Quotin' Terry Kennedy when we watchin' Baker 3
Dreams of ORV's with LED screens
Its like that, y'all run it right back, y'all
These rappers makin' me sick
Boy, you are what you sip
Throw my balance and I fall into an endless abyss
Hangin' by my fingertips, I lose my grip and I slip
(Yuh, aye)
With twin katanas on my back
Hit the Mazda with a sack of sticky ganja on my lap
Gettin' dollas, that's a fact
Boy, you fallin' for the trap
Yeah I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I be where that money at
Press record and run it back
Catch me fucking butt naked in a Polo bucket hat
Shawty rub my back
While she pressin' my juice
Dicin' up fresh fruit
Why you sippin' a deuce
Why you lookin' like a goof, he wearin' two left shoes
Use my influence to show 'em humility's cool
And I ain't mean to humble brag, but I just gots to
'Cause all the rest you mothafuckas ain't doin' nothin' new
[Chorus]
So go and get your numbers up
Your money slim like shady
All the news is fucked up on the TV lately
They'll leave your body slumped
Screamin' fuck you pay me
90's babies in a world gone crazy
Go and get your numbers up
Your money slim like shady
All the news is fucked up on the TV lately
They'll leave your body slumped
Screamin' fuck you pay me
90's babies in a world gon' crazy, yeah
9-90's babies in a world gon'
90's babies in a world gon' crazy
