I Want to Go Out Tonight LyricsI need to break the code
Tell me where's the way into your heart and mind
I need a heart that's full
And free from complication that absorbs my time
I need a hand to hold and 45 thousand for impulsive buys
I don't wanna talk about it anymore
I found ways to get back what is owed to mine

I think I've got, I think I’ve got it back
Becoming something more, yet natural in state
I will take the lead, I talk about the path
To getting to you straight
I really am obsessed, my baby is the best
I say it all the time
I wish you something great
I wanna be alive

Now nothing will break this spell
I'm finally feeling right
I wanna be yours
I wanna go out tonight

Now that life stopped spiraling
And I finally feel inside
I wanna be bad
I wanna go out tonight

Now nothing will break this spell
I wanna go out tonight

Now that life stopped spiraling
I wanna go out tonight

I wanna be yours
I wanna go out tonight
