How It Ends LyricsHold your grandmother's Bible to your breast
Gonna put it to the test
You wanted it to be blessed

And in your heart
You know it to be true
You know what you got to do
They all depend on you

And you already know
Yeah, you already know how this will end
There is no escape from the slave catcher's songs
For all of the loved ones gone
Forever's not so long

And in your soul
They poked a million holes
But you never let them show
Come on, it's time to go

And you already know
Yeah, you already know how this will end

Now you've seen his face
And you know there's a place in the sun
For all that you've done
For you and your children
No longer shall you need
You always wanted to believe
Just ask and you'll receive
Beyond your wildest dreams

And you already know
Yeah, you already know how this will end
You already love will endYou might also like1Embed
