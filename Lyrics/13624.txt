Call On Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
I'll never know why you've had to go
Through all the snow, down each winding road
So lost for hope and carrying it alone

[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Just know that you can call on me
When you're feelin' low, when you're missin' home
Just know that I will always be with you as you go
Closer than you know
[Verse 2: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
'Cause the days are getting colder, the snow begins to fall
Night's a vicious soldier with his shadow standing tall
And we're only getting older, our backs against the wall
And I know if I don't have you, I don't stand a chance at all

[Chorus: Seven Lions, Vancouver Sleep Clinic, Both]
Just know that you can call on me (Oh)
When you're feelin' low, when you're missin' home
Just know that I will always be with you as you go
Closer than you know (Oh)

[Drop: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
With you as you go
Closer than you know

[Chorus: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
Just know that you can call on me
When you're feelin' low, whеn you're missin' home
Just know that I will always be with you as you go
Closеr than you know

[Drop: Vancouver Sleep Clinic]
With you as you go
Closer than you knowYou might also likeEmbed
