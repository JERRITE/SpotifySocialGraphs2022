Time Passes On LyricsTime passes on like a river that must always run;
Now you are gone but I will have you till time is done
You can never take away
The love you gave me yesterday
And I don't have to capture you
'cause you're here in my memory

My life goes on like a song that is never still;
I'll sing that song to the emptiness I'll never fill
I don't need your photograph
To see your face in front of me
We may never touch again
But you're here in this melody
What once was will always be
And you've left your imprint on me
Sometimes I think it's the spark of conflict
With which we affect most heavily
But I hope if you think of me
You'll remember only harmony and

Time passes on like a river that must always run;
Now you are gone but I will have you till time is done
You can never take away
The love you gave me yesterday
And I don't have to capture you
'cause you're here in my memoryYou might also likeEmbed
