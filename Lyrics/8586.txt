Weâ€™re All Just Trying to Get By Lyrics[Verse 1]
Through the airports and train stations
Of the multiplex of nations
All the creatures of creation
All the fishes and crustaceans
To satisfy their sense of station
Through the rules and regulations
And just get by

[Chorus 1]
We're all just trying to get by
We're all just trying to get by
We're all just trying to survive
[Verse 2]
All the time ants in the sand
All the insects in the land
All the wildlife on the plain
Jungle plants expecting rain
All are playing the same game
In the struggle to remain
And just get by

[Chorus 2]
We're all trying to get by
We're all just trying to get by
We're all just trying to survive

[Guitar instrumental solo]

[Bridge to Outro Chorus]
Trying to ...
Trying to ...
Trying to survive

[Outro Chorus]
We're all just trying to get by
We're all just trying to survive
We're all just trying to get by
We're all just trying to surviveYou might also likeEmbed
