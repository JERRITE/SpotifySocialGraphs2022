Survived Lyrics[Intro]
(Conception)
Girl you loved me for day and night, I didn't die
Down on my ass now I still survived
You was out on that block wit' them different guy

[Chorus]
'Cause you loved me for day and night, I didn't die
Down on my ass now I still survived
You was out on that block wit' them different guy
Though that you'r like a brother wit' a different mob
No you wouldn't be there for me if ever I needed you, breakin' my heart, but I didn't cry
I thought you was gon' ride for me, I always believed you, should've known that nigga lied
[Verse 1]
You said you was brother, you snaked me
Now when I'm wit' you, I take it off, safety
How could you say that you made me
I've been that nigga since I was a baby
I should've known you were shady
Now you remindin', I look at you, crazy
Stayed on my grind, 'cause I couldn't be lazy
You asked a hand-out, but looked for a pavement
You know I builded sit up from that basement
You know they call me a [?] basic
You know I still be so high in the matrix
Gettin' in trouble, my mom couldn't take it
Walk through that block, I see all different faces
I hold that chopper up, I swing it all different places
And nigga try me, bring it back to the basics
I'm on my own, so who the fuck was you savin'?
You ever told a nigga the fuck what you sayin'
If you want some smoke, then you just gotta go say it
And you the one that told me I was gonna make it
And now I'm ups bitch you just over the hating
I had to talk the show out, I wasn't playin'
Nigga I was for real
Where you was at? I was out on that field
Bitch, I could've died, you waitin'' for a kill?
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you loved me for day and night, I didn't die
Down on my ass now I still survived
You was out on that block wit' them different guy
Though that you'r like a brother wit' a different mob
No you wouldn't be there for me if ever I needed you, breakin' my heart, but I didn't cry
I thought you was gon' ride for me, I always believed you, should've known that nigga lied

[Verse 2]
I should've know you was fakin'
You really my brother, I'on got no replacement
Look at my hear and it's vacant, uh
Thought you was there for me any occasion
I was polo and naked, uh
Knockin' that wood, but I could've got wasted
You know I toted that hammer and blazed it
I would start clappin' and slappin' the pavement
I would just sleep in that class full of racists
Hang wit' the guys with a pocket and faces
A pant and t-shirt, don't give a fuck what my grade is
Nigga touch me, I [?] do needa face him
Now nobody won't play, uh
Ain't nobody gettin' said, uh
Chopper take a nigga brain, uh
I'ma kill him for the fame, uh
Tryna cop us some Rollies and bigger chains, uh
Now you outta the picture, a different frame
I'on fuck wit' them boys, them niggas lame
And wishin'' it'd defend them, but niggas changed
I don't like them mean niggas, you call them gay
I thought we all should [?]
So now don't you ask, I'm rocking wit' nigga, 'cause I i'on think niggas be rockin' wit' me
Fuck it, catch a nigga sidin' his team
We gon' prolly 'bout to rockin' this sleeve
On that block, I'm prolly cockin' that heat
While you was blockin', party watching, you gettin' knees
You was shot, now 'bout to cop me some sneaks
While me and Jah' should split on somethin' to eat
But now we lookin' at the hunnid in peace
I bet you hungry, prolly want you a bean
[Chorus]
'Cause you loved me for day and night, I didn't die
Down on my ass now I still survived
You was out on that block wit' them different guy
Though that you'r like a brother wit' a different mob
No you wouldn't be there for me if ever I needed you, breakin' my heart, but I didn't cry
I thought you was gon' ride for me, I always believed you, should've known that nigga lied
