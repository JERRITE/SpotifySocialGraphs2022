1Punch Lyrics[Verse 1]
Think you know me cause of pictures
This just the start
I get gold in this rap game Olympics
My finger tip lay on that trigger
It's chilling for years, I been plotting
So now, let's go get it, huh
I'm 'bout to invest in real estate, huh
I'm under the table at dinner dates, uh
My rivals think highly and sit afraid
While my fanbase just sit back and meditate
Fear in your DNA, damn, you might die today
This the way that I feel every fucking day
If they want me to snap, then I'll go insane
If you wanna respond, don't sit back and wait
I will rip the whole life out your body
No, that's not probably, you want it then start it
It's victory season, I'm breaking the margins
And aiming at targets, that's wannabe partners
Last night, I let a pistol blow
Up 'til dawn alone
Felt my soul as it resists below
Contradict my hopes
Now they know they cannot come approach
Aiming for your throat
I don't know if I am slowly dying
Or if I am ghost
Midnight with me, gang on the street
Said the game is over, this the Midnight release
Slide on me please, leave me deceased
Go 'head, pop that lil pill so it put you to sleep
Midnight with me, gang on the street
Said the game is over, this the Midnight release
Slide on me please, leave me deceased
Go 'head, pop that lil pill so it put you to sleep, nah
[Verse 2]
Break, fuck that 'lil bitch on her break
Fuck that 'lil bitch i'ma rain
All of you niggas is lames
Bitch, I'ma run on that plane
Hundred fifty on the plane
Hundred fifty on the dash
Bitch, I'll rape you on a date
Fuck with me, bitch
Yeah, bitch
Oh, yeah, bitch
Yeah [?]
