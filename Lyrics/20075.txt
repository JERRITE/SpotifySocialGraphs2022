I Cum Blood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
Load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
Twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
Smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity
Smell was unbearable
As I unburied her
[Bridge]
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
Down her throat, swallow

[Verse 2]
Eyes glassy and vacant
Body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
Tonguing her rotted anus
I need a live woman
To fill with my fluid
A delicate girl to mutilate, fuck and kill
Her body exceptional
She thought I was normal
But I wanted more
I came blood inside of her
Choking on the clot
Gagging on the snot!

[Bridge]
Gushing blood from her mouth
Bloody gel leaking out

[Verse 3]
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
Sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
Greatest thrill of my life
Slit my own cock with a knife
Violent climax
Surging serum
On my skin

Back from the dead
I am resurrected
To spew putrefaction12Embed
