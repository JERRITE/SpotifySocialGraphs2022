Stuttering LyricsOh
Oh
No
I ain't usually lost for words
This is gotta be a first
And I'm tryna find the reason why I'm stu-stu-stu-stutterin
Something funny's happenin
I'm a place I've never been
And there's got to be a reason why I'm stu-stu-stu-stutterin

Every time you look my way
Something in me feels so strange
And I'm startin to think you are why I'm stu-stu-stutterin
I said hell hell hell hello
And my my my my my my my my my name is Jazmine
And it's so frustrating cus I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing
But it won't come up

Can't believe that I can't talk
But it's not my fault
Cause there's something that you do that's got me stu-stu-stu-stutterin
There's so much that I wanna say
But somethings getting in my way
And I got to figure out
How to stop stu-stu-stuttering

I said hell hell hell hello
And my my my my my my my my name is Jazmine
And it's so frustrating cause I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing
But it won't come up

Try to breathe but I'm suffocating
Just be me but it's complicated
I wanna tell you who I am, where I'm from
Where I go when I wanna be alone

I want you to know me better
Once I get my thoughts together
Should be so easy to tell you how I'm feeling
But I can't help stuttering

And I'm startin to think you are why I'm stu-stu-stu-stuttering5Embed
