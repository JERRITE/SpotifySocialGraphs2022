Televised Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a Tylenol
Took long enough to get back here, crying
Cheap tricks and fortune in a flash
She hits rewind to make it last, crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes
Oh, she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm in paradise
You show me heartbreak a thousand times
I don't care to be or be caught without sweet misery by my side
Wide awake and paper-thin
Prey to anything that's televised
It's safe to say my ignorant state of bliss is why
I'll stay in tonight

'Cause she's so bright
'Cause she's so bright

[Verse 2]
This modern life is a bore and
All is fair in love and war
It's for the best
As insatiable an appetite be put to rest

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's so bright
I can't believe my eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm in paradise
You show me heartbreak a thousand times
I don't care to be or be caught without sweet misery by my side
Wide awake and paper-thin
Prey to anything that's televised
It's safe to say my ignorant state of bliss is why
I'll stay in tonight

She's so bright
She's so bright
She is so bright5Embed
