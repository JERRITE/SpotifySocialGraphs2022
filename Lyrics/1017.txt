It's your world I wanna live in
It's your ocean I wanna swim in
It's your show and I'm just watchin'
Losin' you is not an option

[Pre-Chorus]
If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight
[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

[Verse 2]
You keep talkin', I'll just listen
Daydreamin' 'bout where your lips been
Pull my heart right out my chest, drive a train through
Still get up and forgive you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight

[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh, yeah
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind
You might also like[Bridge]
I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
Oh woah, oh, oh, oh I

[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind (Doesn't even cross your mind)
Yeah, tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild (Runnin' wild, oh)
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

[Outro]
