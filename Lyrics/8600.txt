Power to Love LyricsI was searching for the answer
But I didn't know where to start
So I went down to the doctor
To take a look in his black box
And he said what are you searching for
You don't need this to free your mind
And all the crowd sing
It's time out for the rat race
Feed on it my one true desire
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Know what he said
He said I'll take you on a journey
Across sea and over land
To see the death and the destruction
Brought about by our own hands
And all around the world
Check in to the last chance motel
And all the crowd sing
It's time out for the rat race
Feed on it my one true desire
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Push push push
Push on through
Push on through
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
Now we've got the power to love
We've got the power to hold on to
Push on through
We are the brightest star
