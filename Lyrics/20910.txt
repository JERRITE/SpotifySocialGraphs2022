It Doesn’t Matter Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Well, I don't show off; don't criticize
I'm just livin' by my own feelings
And I won't give in, won't compromise
I just only have a steadfast heart of gold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't know why I can leave though it might be tough
But I ain't out of control, just livin' by my word
Don't ask me why; I don't need a reason
I got my way, my own way, yeah!
[Chorus 1]
It doesn't matter now what happens; I will never give up the fight
There is no way I will run away from all of my frights
Long as the voice inside me says "go", I will always keep on runnin'
There is no way to stop me from goin' to the very top

It doesn't matter who is wrong or who is right

[Interlude]
(Oh— yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Well, I won't look back; I don't need to
Time won't wait and I've got so much to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Where do I stop; It's all a blur and so unclear
Well, I don't know, but I can't be wrong!

[Chorus 2]
This fight is not for anybody; this is purely for myself
There is no way I'm gonna give up 'til the very end
I can't tell what is wrong and what is right; I've got to find the answer
But until I do, there's no way I will ever give up

Place all your bets on the one you think is right!

(Eh!)
(Whoa!)

[Chorus 1]
It doesn't matter now what happens; I will never give up the fight
There is no way I will run away from all of my frights
Long as the voice inside me says "go", I will always keep on runnin'
There is no way to stop me from goin' to the very top

It doesn't matter who is wrong or who is right

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
(Whoa oh!)
(Yah! yah-eah)
(Whoa ho—)2Embed
