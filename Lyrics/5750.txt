Too Good For Giving Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a step, watch the ground
Rise to meet your feet somehow
When all that you are just ain't enough
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up

[Verse 2]
Imposters and counterfeits
So called low lives and misfits
Reclaim your shame and dress it up in love
Tomorrow's waiting down the line
It's getting late but there's still time
You're too good for giving up
[Chorus]
Look how far you've come
Stronger than the damage done
Step out of the darkness unafraid
Remember you belong
Here as much as anyone
Even when you're just about to break

[Verse 3]
Sitting by a bedside light
The lonely guard, the unseen night
Ever further from their god above
Let your silence make a sound
All that's lost can still be found
You're too good for giving up
Let your silence make a sound
All that's lost can still be found
You're too good for giving up

[Chorus]
Look how far you've come
Stronger than the damage done
Step out of the darkness unafraid
Remember you belong
Here as much as anyone
Even when you're just about to break
You might also like[Outro]
Take a step, watch the ground
Rise to meet your feet somehow
When all that you are just ain't enough
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up1Embed
