4th of July Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shower in the dark day, clean sparks diving down
Cool in the waterway where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun, breathing life like fire
I thought I was the only one, but that was just a lie

[Chorus]
'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
Ooh
[Verse 2]
Pale in the flare light, the scared light cracks and disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares, the fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it

[Verse 3]
Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load

[Chorus]
And I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
July, July

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, oh

[Verse 4]
Now I'm in control, now I'm in the fallout
Once asleep, but now I stand
And I still remember your sweet everything
Light a Roman candle and hold it in your hand
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
Yeah...23Embed
