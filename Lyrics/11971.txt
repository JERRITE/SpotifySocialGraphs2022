Off tha Leash! Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, fuck, okay
Fuck out of here, nigga, aight?
Stop playing with me, I don't know what a nigga saying, yeah, I don't give a fuck
You know what I'm saying? I really stand on my shit
Like, I'll really kill one of y'all niggas, I don't give a fuck
Know what I'm saying? You know what I mean?
Like, like, with that shit, you feel me
I'll, I'll really do that to you, bro, for real

Ayy, I had to keep that shit tucked (Tucked)
These niggas know they fucked up (Up)
They ain't want me to turn up (Up)
They ain't want me to show out (Out)
They ain't want me to go up (Up)
They want me all to they self (Self)
They trying to put me on a shelf (Nope)
I had the feelin' these niggas weren't right, but I had to keep that shit to myself (Self)
I have the feelin' these niggas gon' die if they keep fuckin' 'round with they self (Bitch)
I see through niggas intentions, niggas really bitches, don't care what they felt (Nah)
These niggas really need help (Yeah)
It's time to give up the belt

Ayy, ayy
