​love is dying. Lyrics[Intro: Snøw & Powfu]
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying

[Verse 1: Snøw]
I know that you've been calling
Ignoring you is best for me
Don't tell me you think I believe
Anything you'd have to say
Anything, anything
You'd have to say
[Chorus: Snøw & Powfu]
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying

[Verse 2: Powfu]
Never gave me love
Never gave mе what I needed
Saw me falling down
But then you chosе to leave me bleeding
Wonder why I hate you
Girl, I got too many reasons
All over the map, got emotions like the seasons

[Verse 3: Snøw]
Don't say I
Don't say I didn't try
So many restless nights I
Hearing you cry your mind
I swear you love to fight
You might also like[Verse 4: cøzybøy]
I swear you love to fight
You love to cry
You never give it up
In the middle of the night
You love to be right
You don't care to even try
You love to be right
So I gotta say goodbye

[Chorus: Snøw & Powfu]
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying
Tears are falling, always crying
You keep calling, love is dying
I've been stalling, I've been trying
I can see our love is dying

[Outro: Snøw]
Maybe if we met at a different time
We'd be alright, we'd be alright
But until thenEmbed
