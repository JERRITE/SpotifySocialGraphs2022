Wine Stained Lips LyricsSay we're young but we're old now
Everything so simple somehow
I thought that I'd open up for you
But I don't know how
We both know what comes next now

Wine stained lips taste so sweet
I love the way you hold me
At the edge of the balcony
You pour me a glass
Wine stained lips on my cheek
Maybe it's this place, the sky, the city
But I know, I know, I know you really love me
Could I love without you around?
We dance on tables 'til we figure it out
I thought you'd be calling out for me by now
You lost me in the big crowd

Wine stained lips taste so sweet
I miss the way you hold me
At the edge of the balcony
You pour me a glass
Wine stained lips on my cheek
Maybe it's this place, the sky, the city
But I know, I know, I know
Maybe it's this place, the sky or city
But I know, I know, I know you really love meYou might also likeEmbed
