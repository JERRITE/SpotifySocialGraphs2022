Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning) Lyrics[Verse 1]
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had
[Verse 2]
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad (It's not so bad)
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back (You don't need me back)
You're just the best I ever had

[Bridge]
And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

[Verse 3]
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?

[Chorus]
But it's not so bad (It's not so bad)
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back (I don't want you back)
You're just the best I ever had
You might also like[Outro]
(The best I ever had)
