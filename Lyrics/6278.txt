We Are All Insane Lyrics[Verse 1]
Monday makes a fool of me
Tuesday and my jealousy
Wednesday and a cup of tea
Keep calm
Thursday hope keeps tempting me
Friday and her infamy
Weekend I'll go back to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m afraid that I'm going mad
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We are all insane
Our pain is way too loud
Great danger in the clouds
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We are all insane
Our fear is way too proud
Great panic from the crowds
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Monday in its infancy
Tuesday sitting awkwardly
Wednesday creeps respectfully
Keep calm
Thursday night keeps tempting me
Friday in her infamy
Weekends are my specialty

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm afraid that I’ve gone mad

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We are all insane
Our pain is way too loud
Great danger in the clouds
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We are all insane
Our fear is way too proud
Great panic from the crowds
Ah-ah-ah

I feel terrorized
Terrorized, terrorized
I feel terrorized
I feel terrorized
Terrorized, terrorized
I feel terrorized
Ah-ah

[Chorus]
We are all insane
Our pain is way too loud
Great danger in the clouds
Ah-ah-ah-ah
We are all insane
Our fear is way too proud
Great panic from the crowds
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
And I am blessed, ahh
My madness
My-my-my, my madness
My madness
My-my-my, my madnessEmbed
