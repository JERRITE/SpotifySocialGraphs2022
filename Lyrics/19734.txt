We Don’t Need Em’ Lyrics[Intro]
Solo music

[Hook: SckSolo]
Started feelin' myself, care less for the thoughts of a hater, nah
Never needed motivation from 'em
It was nothin' just to cut em' off...
And I be chillin' with the real ones 'cuz the fake ones ain't where I'm from
So how I got you feelin' when we come up in your own city and we start to run it
And we ain't even from it
[Verse 1: SckSolo]
My mind is evil, constantly plottin' to murder beats
I set fire to haters everyday, maybe you heard of me
I could kill could everybody off if I wanted, don't encourage me
Boy bars be Sck, you could never be good as Solo be
Darkskin like how Rolos be
I'ma dig your grave, just when you think its the end of me
6 feet deep
Gettin' money is plan A
Cause messin' with these females, you will end up needin' a plan B
And like burnt pancakes you couldn't flip me
I gotta cool down, I ain't foolin' round with all this heat
From the bars that's charged
With all this hard and heart
Shock em, static electricity, higher than ceilings be
Maybe when you use your senses you can start feelin' me
But until then, I'll continue to ether beats
And havin' your girlfriend jumpin' out her seat
Cause I

[Hook: SckSolo]
Started feelin' myself, care less for the thoughts of a hater, nah
Never needed motivation from 'em
It was nothin' just to cut em' off...
And I be chillin' with the real ones 'cuz the fake ones ain't where I'm from
So how I got you feelin' when we come up in your own city and we start to run it
And we ain't even from it

I'm not ya' average everyday civilian
Don't look em' in his eye, get paralyzed by the vermilion
Filter inside his opticals, his third one is the obstacle
I'm known to move the K right next to E, now the  imPossiblek
Is Ron Stoppable, the sitch is stitched I'm pretty proud of me
They plowed the underdog's courage, didn't react cowardly
Instead he used his power genes
To pull up his own trouser seams
And get his boney ass back on like Bowser's team
These days the browser's seem to be the thing that's beneficial
The issue I got with this is our minds a powerful pistol
Screenshottin' a Snapchat's the way try to come diss you
Can't even enjoy a concert ya' phone in face like a pimple
Lettin' trends come and pimp you, I get it, I'm hypocritical
Till I find a way or stray away, i'll take a sip or two
I got ya' visuals by droppin' nukes and the residual: cold individuals
To say they cool would be equivocal

[Hook: SckSolo]
Started feelin' myself, care less for the thoughts of a hater, nah
Never needed motivation from 'em
It was nothin' just to cut em' off...
And I be chillin' with the real ones 'cuz the fake ones ain't where I'm from
So how I got you feelin' when we come up in your own city and we start to run it
And we ain't even from it
[Verse 3: SckSolo]
I'll never let a hater ether me, running at em' with the bars
Make 'em all retreat
Rambo with the scars and knife in my teeth
When bringing the heat, hotter than coffee be
At ya local ghetto Micky Ds
I promise you gon' remember me
And if I die, I'ma be back like DBZ
This ain't a cartoon, I'm ready to box you
You box I watch, like the 60 for pay per view
I told you boy, like Hulk, I smash
And nothing can hold me you should of known this boy
I make the noise
Hold the games
Cause we don't play the same, we the opposite of Toys R Us
Hold the lust
Cause love disgust
My heart is rust
We don't ever trust like Drake
Cause we got issues
But if you blow and we know its sucks
Then you can continue to try to mess with us..
Ha!

[Verse 4: Jimmy Luna]
Use to be a clone till I divided like reciprocals
Was hangin' with them niggas holdin' pot like a trivet do
I'm happy to be pivotal to hipster bitch's genitals
I'm whippin' out my tentacles, what's Kraken with them digits boo? My pinnacle is on the highest shelf, I'm like the finest elf
All I do is craft shit for kids and watch the ices {​melt}​
My grammar is nicest (welp), when it comes to crisis that your favorite rapper's like a welt, they got big off the nicest belt
Niggas with mouths covered in AU, to get your attention
I'll take their pension, throw they vice away
Like Node Glitch: Ascension, I bet they'd probably be like
"Hey dude!?! Ya' bein' mean to me!"
But all you talk is murder sceneries?
But that's not my business like when Kermit is snitchin'
I'm choppin' limbs and bustin' chins just from jottin' these sentences
I'm the Nemesis your superhero struggles to finish with
Leavin' niggas limpin' off this .22 like I'm Emmitt Smith

[Hook: SckSolo]
Started feelin' myself, care less for the thoughts of a hater, nah
Never needed motivation from 'em
It was nothin' just to cut em' off...
And I be chillin' with the real ones 'cuz the fake ones ain't where I'm from
So how I got you feelin' when we come up in your own city and we start to run it
And we ain't even from it1Embed
