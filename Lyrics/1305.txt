Let It Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heart of gold but it lost its pride
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
I've seen your face in another light
Why'd you have to go and let it die?

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
[Verse 2]
A simple man and his blushing bride
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Intravenous, intertwined
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Hearts gone cold your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?

[Bridge]
Do you ever think of me?
You're so considerate
Do you ever think of me?
Oh, so considerate

[Chorus 2]
In too deep and lost in time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
You might also like[Bridge]
Do you ever think of me?
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me?
Oh, so considerate

[Chorus 2]
In too deep and lost in time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?

[Outro]
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?7Embed
