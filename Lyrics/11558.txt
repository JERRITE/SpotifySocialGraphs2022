Salt in the Wound Lyrics[Verse 1: Lucy Dacus]
You put salt in the wound
And a kiss on my cheek
You butter me up
And you sit down to eat
You add insult to injury
You say you believe in me
But you haven't decided
About taking or leaving me

[Chorus: Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers]
But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret
[Verse 2: Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers]
Neck full of mockingbirds
All calling your name
I tried to sing it all back
Like I heard it, it don't sound the same
I'm gnashing my teeth
Like a child of Cain
If this is a prison, I'm willing to buy my own chain

[Chorus: Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers]
But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

[Outro: Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers]
They say the hearts and minds are on your side
They say the finish line is in your sights
What they don't say is what's on the other side
They say the hearts and minds are on your sideYou might also like8Embed
