FDB Lyrics[Chorus]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game? You can’t touch that shit
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that White2115, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch

[Verse 1]
Three, what you wanna do here? Bitch, I'ma float like root beer
Still workin' on gettin' the coupe cleared, you ain’t got none of my shoe gear
Red on the bottom, right, that red, shawty, she a model, her hair red
Bitch you ugly and bitch you ugly, and both y'all hoes look scary
I don’t wanna get married (Nope) chick, you a bird, parrot
I'm eatin' so good these hoes like, "Boy you're gettin' fat, eat salad"
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it in and I'm bunkin (2 Chainz)
Got your main bitch on my dick, shit, she ain’t nothin' (You lame)
Her hips fat, I seen her walk past, I was like, "Shit"
She seen my Audemar, she tried to touch that, I said, "Bitch"
I bang hoes ridin' in the top drop Range Rove
I train hoes, I’m a pimp, Trinidad James clothes
[Chorus]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game? You can’t touch that shit
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch

[Verse 2]
Three, FDB man, fly like AirTran
Me and E-Louie's got checkerboards on, you ain’t got that pair man
With my FDB clique, thirty-three deep shit
You tell that bitch, "Man fuck that ho, I ain't stuntin' that cheap trick"
Six for a bird bath, bitch, where’s your skirt at?
Ah, I like it, blowin' that kush on you like purp packs
Y’all niggas so wack, and bitch you so green
I pull up on the scene in the green Saleen, yeah nigga, I'm too clean
Westside, what's upper? Y'all niggas my supper
Fuck that bitch, 'fore I do that shit, I might need me a rubber
Belly on rotund, one whip, four guns
If you see the baby mama holla, "Fuck that bitch", that ho ain't no one

[Chorus]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game? You can’t touch that shit
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch

Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from

My True game and my shoe game? You can’t touch that shit
Bitch steady hollerin' 'bout fuck me? Nah, fuck that bitch46Embed
