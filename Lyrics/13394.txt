Cursed Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm in my favorite place, but I feel out of place still
Runnin' out of options, screamin' out, "Lord Jesus, take the wheel"
Tempted to kill all of my plugs, 'cause what if they lace the pills?
I'll be another legend fallen like Lil Peep and Mac Miller
This feeling is familiar
My new girl was scared, I'd go back to her
But I won't say her name, I know that it's cursed

[Verse 1]
But enough about my ex, I got real problems
Upgraded to my dream girl, solved my pill problems
She holdin' all the Percs until I go and fuck the pills out her
My past ruined love for me, I don't know how to feel about it
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, sippin' lean slow, oh, oh, oh, oh
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fucked up, but she still stayed
I can't let her go, no, I can't let her go
Sorrow, being haunted by my wrongs
Sometimes it gets hard to handle
Like oh no, here we go, go, go, go, go
Here we go, go, go
Wake up in the middle of the night gaspin'
For air, I don't know how this shit happened
But I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
[Chorus]
I'm in my favorite place, but I feel out of place still
Runnin' out of options, screamin' out, "Lord Jesus, take the wheel"
Tempted to kill all of my plugs, 'cause what if they lace the pills?
I'll be another legend fallen like Lil Peep and Mac Miller
This feeling is familiar
My new girl was scared, I'd go back to her
But I won't say her name, I know that it's cursed

[Verse 2]
Um, hey bae, it's me again, I know I've been tweakin'
Praying for forgiveness, demons at the cleaners
Never thought I'd have a love like this, and I mean it, oh, woah
Never thought I'd be the drugged out type, okay
"Juice WRLD really live the rock-star life," okay
Shit is not okay, got so paranoid, stopped smokin' Octane
Vision blurry, so my family Stevie Wonder 'bout me
My new girl make it clear, call her Lotti Blu-Ray
Lotti-Dotti Blu-Ray, I don't want no one around me
Feel like they don't want me around anyway, touché
Yeah, yeah, touché
If you couldn't tell, I'm real intoxicated
Just to fall asleep, but I know all my demons gonna wake me
I can't get no peace, now I'm starting to really grow impatient
I'm my enemy, but I don't feel like talkin' about it
Leave me alone and let me be

This feeling is familiar

But I won't say her name, I know that it's cursed14Embed
