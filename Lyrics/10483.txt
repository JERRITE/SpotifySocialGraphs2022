Concrete Angel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me breathe you in, and breathe the words in your mouth
Inside you're shivering, the silence shouts so loud
I just want to, I just want to stay around
And while my heart beats, I promise I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
If I'm somewhere else, it doesn't mean that I don't see
That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me
It makes me crazy, when you're crazy
You don't speak, you think you know me
But what you know is just skin deep
[Chorus]
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls

[Chorus]
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, until the concrete angel fallsYou might also like6Embed
