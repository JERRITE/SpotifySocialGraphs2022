Chapel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm going to get married today
The chapel is full of flowers and sage
He'll lift up my veil and he will say
"Are you sure that you love me?
Are you sure you can wait?"

[Verse 2]
He cuts into the wedding cake
And licks the frosting off the blade
He cuts into our palms, drops our blood into the lake
We stand on the bridge and give ourselves away
[Chorus]
I can be good, I can be true
You know I don't love anyone, but I love you
I can be good, I can be true
You know I don't love anyone, but I love you

[Verse 3]
I'm going to get married today
The chapel is full of crosses and bouquets
We pray to the wax bride and her violet varicose veins
Kiss me with forever where only death remains

[Chorus]
I can be good, I can be true
You know I don't love anyone, but I love you
I can be good, I can be true
You know I don't love anyone, but I love you

[Outro]
I'm going to get married today
So please don't touch me, please stay away
I know I'm not good, I've never been true
But you know that I love him and I don't love youYou might also like7Embed
