Hollandaise Lyrics[Intro]
(Wait a minute)
Same song, new dance
Same song, new dance, ho
Ho (Wait a minute)
Same song, new dance (Ayy)
Same song, new dance, ho (Man, look)

[Verse 1]
Get up off my dick, let me talk my shit
Let me show 'em how I feel, for real (Real)
These niggas ain't ill, they ain't got no skill
They ain't got no will, for real (Uh-uh)
I was ten-and-two on Central
Tryna make my dream come true (I was)
Youngin from Del Amo tryna let y'all know just what we go through (Uh-huh)
I was back-to-back at the bastard shack for a pack of Blacks
Tank wasn't on "F", as a matter of fact, it was half of half of that (That's fact)
Stopped goin' to church, like, "What it's all worth?"
What would Jesus do if he was in thеse shoes?
If Johnny pull up, I'm fucked, I'm drunk
Had Rossi in thе trunk, I was off that Jesus juice
Had the passion of Christ, I ain't need a Jesus piece (Uh-uh)
Just needed the people to believe in me (Yeah)
I ain't need a AP to put my city on the M-A-P (Nah)
Was a fade away from banging the ECC
The OG told me, "Stick to slingin' them ABCs" (Yeah)
[Chorus]
On the block, they done locked up
Locked in, I ain't give a fuck
Got it in while the getting was good (Same song, new dance)
Ooh (Same song, new dance, ho)
(Yeah) On the block, they done locked up
Locked in, I ain't give a fuck (Yeah)
Got it in while the getting was good (Same song, new dance)
Ooh (Same song, new dance, ho)

[Verse 2]
Get up off your ass
Go and get some cash, show 'em you mean business (Yeah)
Go above and beyond, evolve, these niggas so primitive
Left the murder scene, ain't leave no witnesses (Ugh)
My name must be "Abraham—
Lincoln," bitch, I'm innocent (Yeah, yeah)
Ugh, life's too short, you should be gettin' it, ugh (Yeah)
While the getting is good, if you knew better, you would (Ugh)
Gotta go hard in the paint
Gotta night-ride when they call it a day
All work, no play, crank up the ball and the chain
Dropped off on all you lames, y'all all in my way
Ayy, they been afflicted by this, off top
On top of the injured list, sit 'em in intensives (Yeah)
We knock 'em out like mama say, raisin' all of the stakes (Ugh)
To win this shit, I, I been addicted, I need hollandaise (Yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
On the block, they done locked up
Locked in, I ain't give a fuck
Got it in while the getting was good (Same song, new dance)
Ooh (Same song, new dance, ho)
On the block, they done locked up
Locked in, I ain't give a fuck
Got it in while the getting was good (Same song, new dance)
Ooh (Same song, new dance, ho)

[Outro]
Yeah, ho (Wait a minute)
Same song, new dance
Same song, new dance, ho
Ho (Wait a minute)
Same song, new dance
Same song, new dance, ho
(Wait a minute)
(Wait a minute)
(Wait a minute)
(Wait a minute)Embed
