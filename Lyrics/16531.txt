For Your Eyes Only Lyrics[Verse 1]
Medicate my soul with your lips, I need
I need to forget that my love's at peace
With another man who respects and treats
Treats her with a trust, and honesty

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
[Verse 2]
Make me come alive, I just want to breathe
I've been up for days, I just want to sleep
Please relieve the stress, got me on my knees
So heal me with your warmth, give yourself to me

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just wanna feel again, again
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only, oh, yeahYou might also like1Embed
