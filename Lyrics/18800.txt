Unhallowed Lyrics[Intro]
I feel no one will ever listen
The remnants of an empty soul
The ghost of monumental failure
Unhallowed

[Refrain]
I feel no one will ever listen
The remnants of an empty soul
The ghost of monumental failure
Unhallowed
[Verse 1]
I lay in bed awake
The anguish slowly aches
I'm starring at a dark abyss and wondering why
Crawling back to the womb
My depression a tomb
There's a fog inside my mind
So much hatred and doom
When the dead roses bloom
As I sabotage my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
Mind is fading
Going crazy (Now)

[Chorus]
I feel dead inside
An empty soul
And what was once my life
Is unhallowed

[Refrain]
I feel no one will ever listen
The remnants of an empty soul
The ghost of monumental failure
Unhallowed
You might also like[Verse 2]
Time slipping through my hands
Like granules of sand
This rusted razor blade is looking all too kind
When I close my eyes
Thoughts of suicide
There's an ache inside my soul
Just a shell of a man
In these hopeless hands
Blackened heart is stitched and sewn

[Pre-Chorus]
Mind is fading
Going crazy (Now)

[Chorus]
I feel dead inside
An empty soul
And what was once my life
Is unhallowed

[Post-Chorus]
I will not collapse, strong against the pressure
This final relapse, defiant gesture
Headstrong I overcome, lion's den of enemies
Tight lips, play dumb, in the belly of the beast
Unbound rage, the punishment of concrete
Pure in hate, malevolence I will defeat
[Bridge 1]
From crimson sky, I am this dark eternity

[Bridge 2]
New life begins
When darkness dies, I'm born again
These frozen bones remind me I'm so
Cold and alone
For the shame, I've caused this throne
Broken crown, weighs me down
But my demons I can't drown

[Outro]
I feel no one will ever listen
The remnants of an empty soul
The ghost of monumental failure
Unhallowed
I feel no one will ever listen
The remnants of an empty soul
The ghost of monumental failure
