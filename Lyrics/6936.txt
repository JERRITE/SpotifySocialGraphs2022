We Might Even be Falling In Love (Interlude) Lyrics[Verse]
Go 'head, act a fool in it
Freestyle with me 'til you find your groove in it
U-Haul 'cause I might let you move in it
'Cause I ain't had nobody hit it like you hit it
And it feels like
I'm gonna know you for the rest of my life
It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love
Ooh, love, love, love
Ooh, love, love, loveYou might also like4Embed
