Rattled Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, well
I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep

[Chorus]
I get rattled, baby, oh, over you

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted and I'm up and I'm down
[Chorus]
I get twisted, baby, oh, over you

[Bridge]
Well, baby, baby, baby, won't you save one night for me?
Baby, baby, baby, is there something wrong with you?
Baby, baby, baby, this is out of my control
It looks like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm twisted, shaken, rattled

[Chorus]
I get rattled, baby, oh, over you
Rattled baby, over you

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, baby, baby, won't you save one night for me?
Baby, baby, baby, is there something wrong with you?
Oh, baby, baby, baby, this is out of my control
It looks like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm rattled, twisted, shaken

[Chorus]
I get twisted, baby, oh, over you

[Verse 3]
Whoa, I get shaken, I get torn up by the roots
Yeah, I'm shakin' way down in my boots
You might also like[Outro]
I get rattled, baby, oh, over you
Yeah, I get rattled, baby, oh, over you
Yeah I'm rattled, baby, over youEmbed
