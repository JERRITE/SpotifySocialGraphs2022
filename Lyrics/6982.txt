Dancing with a Stranger (Acoustic) Lyrics[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire?
I need somebody who can take control
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

[Verse 2: Normani]
I wasn't even going out tonight
But boy, I need to get you off of my mind
I know exactly what I have to do
I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Normani & Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancin' with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancin' with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Ooh

[Outro: Sam Smith, Normani & Both]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new (Ooh)
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
I'm dancin', I'm dancin'
I'm dancin', I'm dancin'
I'm dancin', I'm dancin'
Dancin' with a strangerYou might also likeEmbed
