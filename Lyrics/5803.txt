Seen the Light Lyrics[Intro: Rico Love]
(I see the light)
Yo, uh, just feel real good right here, man
It's a good look, sugar bear, it's love
(I see what's wrong)
Young Chris, Gucci what up?
(See all the things I've heard about)
From the streets of V.A
Talk to the whole world, man
(See all the things I've read about)
Ghetto America, talk to 'em, man (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(I've seen the light)
[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's been a struggle for me
Wondering why I can't get by with my life
But now I'm free
And I done did some right and wrong but still I seen the light
And I done been around the sex and drugs
Hustling but mama ain't raise no thug
And it took a little to see
How real it could get and how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Seen a lot of bad things on my block
But I ain't wanna be a victim of a gunshot
I can't let nothing hold me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about (Woo)
See all the things I've read about (Woah, oh)
I seen the light (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard for me
To stay away from all these girls and the haters, they don't like
That I'm fulfilling my dream
But I'm just tryna do my thing, my nigga, can't I live my life?
I got the world on my shoulders (Shoulders)
And I'm only getting older (Older)
But it's like it's getting colder
I'm gon' make it but I can't take it sometimes

I came a long way from my block
And I'm grateful for everything I got
I didn't let nothing bring me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about (Ooh, yeah)
See all the things I've read about
I seen the light

[Interlude: Chris Brown]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Wow, huh man, after all this, who woulda thought? (Yeah)
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia
Y'all know what I'm saying? Would make it all the way to the top

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it (Don't like to hear it)
Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it (Uh, uh)
Like a runner, a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurrin', it was stirrin' up my hunger
But I couldn't let the **** bury a ***** under (Don't let it)
Used to cry hopin' all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I've won
'Cause I took my shades off and now I'm starin' at the sun
(See all the things I've heard about)
I'm seein' the light, I'm seein' the light
Uh, realizin' that it's me in the light
(See all the things I've read about)
I read about it (Read about it)
Heard about it (Heard about it), and now I know (Woo!)
(I've seen the light)
[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I coulda did wrong
I seen a lot of people hustle but I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
Taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
(I seen the light) I seen the light

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about
All the things I've heard about
See all the things I've read about
I've read about it, I've read about it, oh
I seen the light
I see the light, I see the light2Embed
