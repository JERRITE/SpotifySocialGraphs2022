Iâ€™m Always Right Lyrics[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
You're trying not to like it
But I know that you'll enjoy it
When you're gone
And everyone that looks at us
Is sure who there is something going on
Well you always say you're right
But I know sometimes that you surely must be wrong
You're trying not to like it
But I know that you'll enjoy it
When you're gone
[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always right
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always right

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
I told you not to push me
But you didn't hear a single word I said
And every time I look at you
I'm sure that you would rather see me dead

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always right
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always right, I
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always right
Well I just can't let you get your way tonight
But deep down inside you know I'm always rightYou might also like1Embed
