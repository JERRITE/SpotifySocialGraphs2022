Sinners Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fortune, fortune, smile and fade
I haven't seen you much of late
Need you now, cannot wait
But when I look, you're not around
Never minding what we do
The night's still good for a gram or two
I'll be drinking late with you
Until the morning comes around

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I must be good for something
Yeah, yeah
Oh sinners come down, come gather 'round
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobbled streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah, I must be good for something
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Down and out, and out of luck
We're spinning, but the needle's stuck
Let's go have some fun before
They put us in the ground
Lie and sit in solemn lines
Drinking gin and dropping limes
Wasting beats of this heart of mine
Until the morning comes around

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I must be good for something
Yeah, yeah
Oh sinners come down, come gather 'round
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobbled streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah, I must be good for something
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Oh sinners come down
Come gather 'round
Have a little fun before they put us in the ground
Yeah-eh-eh
Dancing on cold feet
Marching on cobbled streets
Oh sinners come down, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah, I must be good for something
Yeah, yeahYou might also like5Embed
