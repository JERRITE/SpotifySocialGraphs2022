If I Get Caught Lyrics[Intro]
Just fuckin' them girls, I was gon'—
I was gon' get right back
Just fuckin' them girls, I was gon'—
I was gon' get right back

[Verse 1: Daniel Daley]
You wouldn't want me if you thought I never had hoes
Women like men other women like
That's just something that everyone knows
[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Daley]
Don't forget I was a fly nigga when you got here (Yeah)
Charismatic when you got here (Uh, yeah)
You knew about me when you got here
Now you're trippin', girl, it's not fair
And you got my phone in your hands
Questions? Not again
Why do we do this this?
When really, the truth is

[Chorus: Daniel Daley, Choir]
If I get caught cheating, that don't mean I don't lovе you
Fuckin' them girls, I was gon'—, I was gon'— (Say it again)
If I get caught cheating (Chеating), that don't mean I don't love you
Fuckin' them girls, I was gon—'
I know, I know you won't ain't gon' let one little fuck (One little fuck)
Mess all this up (Mess all this up)
Don't let one mistake (One mistake)
Take all this away (Take all this away)
Don't let one little fuck (If they know now)
Mess all this up (An affair, yeah)
Don't let one mistake
Take all this away (Get right back)

[Verse 2: Daniel Daley]
Would you rather be the girl that cry in a Corolla or a foreign?
I don't wanna see you cry, I recognize the signs, I can't ignore 'em
And to tell the truth, it'll hurt you more, if you ever find what you're lookin' for
I ain't perfect
Baby girl, I'm worth it

[Chorus: Daniel Daley, Choir]
If I get caught cheating, that don't mean I don't love you (That don't mean I don't love you, you)
Fuckin' them girls, I was gon'—, I was gon'—
