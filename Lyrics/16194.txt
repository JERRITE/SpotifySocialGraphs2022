TranslationsPortuguêsJosslyn Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know we never said where we drew the line
But I was in your bed almost every night
I thought we made it clear how we felt, read the signs
But now there's nothing left 'cause you did nothing right

[Pre-Chorus]
You had to go and ruin it
So you could get a quick fuck
I'm sure you had fun doing it
And I won't make a big fuss
[Chorus]
But know we're off and we'll never be on again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Don't wanna fight, I just never wanna talk again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
I know we weren't together, but we're more than friends
Said you couldn't see me while she gave you head
So please don't ever call again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Yeah, I hope that it was worth it

[Verse 2]
You didn't wanna be like the boys from before
But look at what you did 'cause you hurt me more
You didn't have to lie like the truth is a chore
I guess I can't be mad 'cause I was never yours

[Pre-Chorus]
You had to go and ruin it
So you could get a quick fuck
I'm sure you had fun doing it
And I won't make a big fuss

[Chorus]
But know we're off and we'll never be on again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Don't wanna fight, I just never wanna talk again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
I know we weren't together but we're more than friends
Said you couldn't see me while she gave you head
So please don't ever call again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Yeah, I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Yeah, I hope that it was worth it

Can't believe I was so stupid
Just another girl you ruined
My friends said I shouldn't do it
Should've listened, guess I blew it
So have fun fucking Josslyn

[Chorus]
But know we're off and we'll never be on again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Don't wanna fight, I just never wanna talk again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
I know we weren't together but we're more than friends
Said you couldn't see me while she gave you head
So please don't ever call again
I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Yeah, I hope that it was worth it fucking Josslyn
Yeah, I hope that it was worth it13Embed
