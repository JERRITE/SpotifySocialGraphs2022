If You Know Whatâ€™s Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
How come you've hit that final chapter
So young, your days of being free
And I'm all for happy ever after
Just be sure it's where you want to be

[Chorus]
Baby, if you know what's right
You'll spend another year with Mama
Next thing you know your life's been
Taken down a different road
No, I don't wanna be like that
I'll love you till the end no matter
Just don't leave yourself behind
Please promise me you won't be saying you should
Of things that you could have become
[Verse 2]
I guess you've chose to take your chances
You know it's harder to agree
Just be sure that you know what the catch is
There's no cure for failed hopes and dreams

[Chorus]
Baby, if you know what's right
You'll spend another year with Mama
Next thing you know your life's been
Taken down a different road
No, I don't wanna be like that
I'll love you till the end no matter
Just don't leave yourself behind
Please promise me you won't be saying you should
Of things that you could have become

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Baby, if you know what's right
You'll spend another year with Mama
Next thing you know your life's been
Taken down a different road
No, I don't wanna be like that
I'll love you till the end no matter
Just don't leave yourself behind
Please promise me you won't be saying you should
Of things that you could have become
