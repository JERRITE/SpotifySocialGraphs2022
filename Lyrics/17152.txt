Calvin Cambridge Lyrics[Intro]
R-B-E S-O-B that's the gang bitch

[Verse 1: DaBoii]
Bitch Iâ€™m DaBoii
Who the fuck is you nigga?
S-O-B the gang, y'all ain't fuckin wit' my crew nigga
Day ones only, I don't really fuck wit' new niggas
Choppa like a thot, touch one you get blew nigga
Bitch, stop actin'
Like a white crowd chop won't stop clappin'
Allergic to a snake they like boy stop dabbin'
These niggas want my head, chop won't stop blastin'
Nigga be cautious, shout out to T.O
All white buffs OMG, think I'm Deebo
Bro got that chop, clip longer than a peacoat
Two chops get to singin' like Michael and Tito
Middle fingers to the feds they lockin' all my niggas up
Strip a officer for his badge, make him give it up
Nah I'm playin, keep ya badge we don't give a fuck
Vallejo, California where them youngin's they be quick to bust
Ruthless!
We don't really give a fuck nigga
I don't got no feelin's, I'ma laugh, ain't no fucks given
Circle got small, I don't really like to trust niggas
Shoutout all my niggas, S-O-B it's just us nigga!
[Chorus: DaBoii]
Gangin', gangin', bitch I be gangin'
Chopper start singin' if yo mouth where my name is
In my own lane, middle fingers to a lane switch
S-O-B bitch! We be ballin' Calvin Cambridge

[Verse 2: DaBoii]
Speakin' on my name I'ma laugh, get yo bands up
Brody go broke, it ain't shit, pick my mans up
Nappy head nigga and you niggas is my dandruff
Niggas all talk LOL, they just playin' tough
I'm that nigga hoes see me throw my gang up
Young wild niggas, we them niggas, they can't tame us
Brody keep a strap, where we go it be dangerous
Nappy head nigga, middle fingers to a taper
These Cartier, so please don't touch me
Better watch yo bitch, if not she gon' fuck me
Margielas out of space, they like these so ugly
I'm runnin' to the chips like casino money

[Chorus: DaBoii]
Gangin', gangin', bitch I be gangin'
Chopper start singin' if yo mouth where my name is
In my own lane middle fingers to a lane switch
S-O-B bitch! We be ballin' Calvin Cambridge
Gangin', gangin', bitch I be gangin'
Chopper start singin' if yo mouth where my name is
In my own lane middle fingers to a lane switch
S-O-B bitch! We be ballin' Calvin CambridgeYou might also like5Embed
