Heaven for Everyone Lyrics[Intro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 1]
In these days of cool reflection
You come to me
And everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine
[Chorus]
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one

[Verse 2]
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days
Of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me
Soothe my troubled mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free
This world could be one
We should bring love
To our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could
Be heaven for everyone

You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 3]
Listen, what people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

[Outro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone4Embed
