Walk in My Shadow LyricsMy throat is dry
My knees are weak
It's so damned hot
I can't even speak
Walk in my shadow
I can't take it anymore
When i get you in the shadows
I'm gonna show you what it's for
Yes i know baby
That's a shady kind of deal
I just want to find out
How you feel
Walk in my shadow
I ain't gonna take it anymore
When i get you in the shadow
I'm gonna give you what's in store
Yes i know you say i'm stupid
It just wouldn't be cool
Well i can tell baby that
I ain't no fool
Walk in my shadow
I can't take it anymore
When i get you in the shadow
I'm gonna lay you on the floor
When i get you in the shadow
I'm gonna give you what's in storeYou might also likeEmbed
