Give Up Baby Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night l got drunk
Waitin' at the boxcar like you wanted
I waited, you called
Then you never made it
I'm just sad alone
Tryin' to pick it up and move along

[Refrain]
You said you're ready for a long time
But you're on a roll of making fine
Let me be no other
Living like another sip and I'll be fine
But then I'm comin' off again
Wouldn't even remember that same look you're hiding there
I never seem to knock it anyhow
Knock it back and pow
Amazing, I cave in
As all my worries slip away again
[Chorus]
One for the party baby
Puff on the rolled drum and
Knock back a drink
Thеre's nobody home
Wakin' up Monday only to realizе
That your Saturday self ain't one you like
But I get by, don't you know?
Give up, baby, go

[Verse 2]
Last night I dropped acid
And came to know of all things passing
Most just get away
That's what George's records say
But I'm just sad alone
Tryin' to live right back in years ago

[Refrain]
You said you're ready for a long time
But you're on a roll of getting high
Let me be no other
Living like another sip and I'll be fine
But then I'm comin' off again
Wouldn't even remember that same look you're hiding there
I never seem to knock it anyhow
Knock it back and pow
Amazing, I cave in
As all my worries slip away again
You might also like[Chorus]
One for the party baby
Puff on the rolled drum and
Knock back a drink
There's nobody home
Wakin' up Monday only to realize
That your Saturday self ain't one you like
But I get by, don't you know?
Give up, baby, go6Embed
