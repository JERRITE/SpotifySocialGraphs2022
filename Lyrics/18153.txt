Be Happy (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: Dixie & blackbear]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there, let me be sad (Yeah)

[Verse 1: blackbear]
I don't wanna get up out of bed this season
All bad days, walk away, leave me bleedin'
It's fuck you and you
Fuck today, fuck this pain I been feelin'
I've got the devil on my shoulder, heart is getting colder
But I keep to myself
Anxiety been creepin', staring at the ceiling
But I don't need your help 'cause
[Chorus: Dixie]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let mе be sad
Sometimes I just wanna bе lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad

[Post-Chorus: Dixie & Lil Mosey]
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Mosey & Dixie]
Sometimes I be by myself 'cause it feel better
Sometimes my heart feel like snow, like it's cold weather
I know everyone fake, I just roll with it
So you can't come with me, you can't roll with it
All of you making me mad, I had to spaz out
I know it made me feel better so I had to cash out
This fame not what it seems
It bring bad bad energy
But

[Chorus: Dixie]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad

[Verse 3: Dixie]
Bad days, it's okay, let me feel it
In some ways, you've got to break your heart to heal it
I've got chips on my shoulder, only gettin' older
So I keep to myself
Ain't tryna complain, just don't wanna explain it
But

[Chorus: Dixie]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad
