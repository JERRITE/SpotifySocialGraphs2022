OK crazy LyricsDamnit you've been stuck on my mind
I’ve been thinking of u all of the time
I've been following u all over town
But you never even know I'm around

And now I’ve got a confession to make
Your girl, didn't mean to scare her away
I just need to have u all to myself
And it's really been affecting my health

She would never love you like I do
All I ever wanted was to make u happy
All I ever really wanted was u under me
I'd give anything to have u here beside me
I might be fucking crazy
All I ever wanted was to make u happy
All I ever really wanted was u under me
If ur feeling like ur living in a nightmare
It might be a daydream…

Everybody's acting insane
Always telling me that I should seek help
I'm just thinking of how happy we'd be
If you'd only take a look at me
Take a look at me
Am I not pretty?

All I ever wanted was to make u happy
All I ever really wanted was u under me
I’d give anything to have u here beside me
I might be fucking crazy
All I ever wanted was to make u happy
All I ever really wanted was u under me
If ur feeling like ur living in a nightmare
It might be a daydream

If ur feeling like ur living in a nightmare
If ur feeling like ur living in a nightmare
If ur feeling like ur living in a nightmare
It might be a daydream
