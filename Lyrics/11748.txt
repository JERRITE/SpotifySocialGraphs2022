TranslationsDeutschCalifornian Soil Lyrics[Verse 1]
I left my soul
On Californian soil
And I left my pride
With that woman by my side
I never had a willing hand
And I never had a plan
But I'm glad I found you here
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I never had a name
And I never felt the same
They keep on trying it on
And they will keep on trying it on
And they will keep on trying it on
And I never felt the same
[Verse 2]
I'm young, I'm old
And so you do what you're told
I never had a willing hand
And so you pack up all your bags
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I never felt the same
And this life is just a game
They keep on trying it on
They keep on trying it on
And they won't keep on trying it on
Until you never feel the sameYou might also like2Embed
