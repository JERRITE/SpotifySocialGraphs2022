Wet Em Up Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro: Lil Tjay]
Yeah
Turn me up a lil' bit
Let's roll
Ayy, ooh, ooh (No, no)
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
First nigga play, I bet he die
Bet he get left up in the sky (Left up in the sky)
Niggas been hatin', wonder why?
I been just lettin' bullets fly (Lettin' bullets fly)
Heard niggas talkin' on the book
They don't wan' see us, Smelly Drive (See a homicide)
Heard niggas talkin' on the book
They don't wanna see a homicide
We gon' wet 'em up, wet 'em up
I don't talk much through the cellular (No, no)
Been in that field thumbin' through drills
Shit ain't 'bout nothin', that's regular
And I been on that time, ain't no lettin' up
Don't you think 'cause my paper been gettin' up
I won't drill a nigga (Grr)
I'll still drill a nigga, maybe kill a nigga, bitch
[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
40 go dumb, I gave my lil' bro a drum (What else?)
Nigga, you dumb, caught him, he ain't have his gun
I'm gettin' paper, ain't got time for niggas, that's just what they want
I don't mean swingin' when I say that MAC leave a nigga swung
Bro caught a body, he ran
No cameras on him, so he might just beat it
If niggas don't tell on the stand
Hope niggas don't tell on the stand
All these opp niggas really be fans (Fans)
She stay on my dick, I know they mad
Tjay been gettin' the bands
Dummy, I had me a plan, try me, get blammed

[Verse 2: Sheff G]
R.I.P. the guys, free the guys
If he disrespect, then he should die
He ain't gettin' to the money, he a liar
Huh, throw the threes up in the sky
I put in pain
Any who want it, you know they get it, for the gang
Act like you want it, then you could get it, look
Run up the numbers and move like a running back, huh
You know we run up them numbers, so baby talk money, we into that, huh
You know we run up them numbers, so baby talk money, we into that
(You know we run up them numbers, baby, uh, uh)

Uh, look, we put the whole city on the map
Look, whole city on my back
Two or three hoes with me, couple bros with me
They gon' go for me, that's a fact
Pop out, we on timin', huh, yeah, we on timin'
Ask my opps, bet they gon' lie
Ridin' 'round the block with a big ol' nine
We don't get shiggy, nah
We never get shiggy
Back out chops, niggas gettin' busy
Roll up the pack, niggas gettin' slizzy
I ain't with your sis, probably with your bitty
Ooh, and I get love in my city
Ooh, but ain't no love in my city
Pull up, you catch a slug, on my mama
I gotta wet 'em up, that's a problem
I gotta do it, huh, huh
Run up that bag, know I'm gettin' to it
Ooh, she wanna do it
She wanna fuck to my music
No Corona, boy, I'm too sick
I just been coppin' all this new drip
Hold on, huh, wait, huh
She want Chanel, I just wanna hit
Name ring bells all up on your strip
Toilet gang, nigga, I'm the shit, huh
(Said toilet gang, nigga, I'm the shit, uh)
(Toilet gang, nigga, I'm the shit)
[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
First nigga play, I bet he die
Bet he get left up in the sky (Left up in the sky)
Niggas been hatin', wonder why?
I been just lettin' bullets fly (Lettin' bullets fly)
Heard niggas talkin' on the book
They don't wan' see us, Smelly Drive (See a homicide)
Heard niggas talkin' on the book
They don't wanna see a homicide
We gon' wet 'em up, wet 'em up
I don't talk much through the cellular (No, no)
Been in that field thumbin' through drills
Shit ain't 'bout nothin', that's regular
And I been on that time, ain't no lettin' up
Don't you think 'cause my paper been gettin' up
I won't drill a nigga (Grr)
I'll still drill a nigga, maybe kill a nigga, bitch5Embed
