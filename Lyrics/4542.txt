Constipation Lyrics[Intro: ScHoolboy Q & Ab-Soul]
Chyeah , chyeah, chyeah, chyeah
Brrat, black
Yeah (Uh)
Get it
As we proceed (Yeah, brrat, bop, boom)
To give you what you need (Yeah, yeah, Q)
T-D-E (Q, Soul, Q)
Hah, hah

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q & Ab-Soul]
Omega
Black Hippy came through to switch flavors (Ugh)
Wake and bake, no taters
Pa-pass me the ketchup, I'll homestyle fry 'em (Fry)
(You niggas better catch up as swift as I am)
I was born in Zion, I defeated the Lion
Soul made of iron, yeah, Soul made of iron
Nah, nigga talking how you can't fold when you trying (Oh)
Strive for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying (Dying)
Fuck the world, missionary (Yeah); Malcolm got popped (Yeah)
Obama got in office, and I'm still on the block (Yeah)
Ain't shit changed, the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high, flying objects (Hahaha) Yes!
We got next, now forever the Hippy is black interrogated by
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maize together and blaze (Don't be afraid), hey
See, this is how we do
Would say I thought you knew, but that would not be true (Ooh)
In fact, ve Q (You fags are through)
And like all of you teachers thus far
I'm passin' you, ooh
[Chorus: Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, & Both]
Black Hippy, Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy (Soul)
Black Hippy, Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy (Yeah)
Black-bla-b-b-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-b-b-Black Hippy (Yeah)
Please fix your face
We building up so much anticipation (Fuck bitches)
We finna shock the nation, oh shit, oh shit
Constipation
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes
We finna shock the nation, oh shit, oh shit (Fuck bitches, fuck hoes)
Constipation (Fuck bitches, fuck hoes)
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes (As we proceed)

[Verse 2: Jay-Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Activist (Black Hippy)
Rebel without a cause
Full clip left you stiff like a mannequin
Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal
What you on? I'm on some other shit
Feeling like I stepped off the mothership
We sabotage the government (Uh-huh)
CIA gotta evacuate when we done
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run (Mm)
It's going down I said (Boogie down, down)
Boogie down Bronx (In a black borrow hound)
Bumping Biggie like (Pac ain't dead)
Two side call it Twenty-two (Uh)
I'm twenty-two and I rap like twenty zoos (Mm)
Mm, straight animal
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
Protein shakes, acid, and manure (Goddamn!)
