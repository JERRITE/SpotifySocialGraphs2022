On the Level Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy, this could be your year
Make an old man proud of you, forget about the tears
On the level, see me eye-to-eye
Stand up like a man even from the other side

[Chorus]
On the level
On the level

[Verse 2]
Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance, never had a voice
On the level, carrying a name
Fall until my final day, now, who's there left to blame?
[Chorus]
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
