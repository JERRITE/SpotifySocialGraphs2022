Screamager Lyrics[Verse 1]
With a face like this I won't break any hearts
And thinking like that I won't make any friends

[Bridge]
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to think about anything like that

Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to know about anything like that
[Chorus]
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you

[Verse 2]
Your beauty makes me feel alone
I look inside but no one's home

[Bridge]
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to think about anything like that

Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to know about anything like that

[Chorus]
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you

I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
You might also like[Outro]
But get screwed up on you
But get screwed up on youEmbed
