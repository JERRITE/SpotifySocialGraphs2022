Hit Em (The Recipe) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ayesha got 'em serving the electro Mischa Barton
Going shopping out at Kitson, I'm the sexy robot vixen
Life in plastic is so hot, let them motherfuckers rot
Add some reverb and delay then a chunky 808
That's the recipe, messy so don't mess with me
Used to give them kisses now the misses is an entity
Erotic, sipping, hypnotic, bitch, get your audience
Your audio is rubbish, I'm a fucking music nauseant

[Chorus]
Slap 'em round (Slap 'em round)
Feel the sound (Feel the sound)
Chop it up (Chop it up)
Pitch it down (Down)
Smack it back (Smack it back)
Drag it out (Drag it out)
Electronic (Electronic)
Disco sound

[Verse 2]
Laser beams here, copy, paste what you just heard
Razor sharp glitching, getcha hook outta one word
A-Y-E-S-H-A, I brought crack back in the USA
Lick it up baby, getcha fix
Sorry, can't talk now 'cause I'm taking dicks
G-L-A-M-O-U-R, cutting up with a cocaine superstar
Now pass the pipe, you're my rock of love
If you're tired of smoking, bitch, shoot this up
Now drop the beat, high-speed
The beat is pussy, I'mma start to eat
The beat is pussy, I'mma start to eat
The beat is pussy, I'mma start to eat

[Chorus]
Slap 'em round (Slap 'em round)
Feel the sound (Feel the sound)
Chop it up (Chop it up)
Pitch it down (Down)
Smack it back (Smack it back)
Drag it out (Drag it)
Electronic (Electronic)

Then hit 'em with the

[Bridge]
It's Ayesha Erotica
The princess of gangbangs
I fucked ten french DJs in one night
Do an eight ball with celebrities, that's how I fucking go
