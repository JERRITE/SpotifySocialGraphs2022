Heart of a Dancer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lucifer, he came to me
He said, "Take this bass guitar, kid, then you'll be free"
It's true, it's true
I then saw the gates of hell
They were lined with golden amplifiers, I could tell
It was cool, it was cool

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They were calling out my name
But I could not be found
I was falling through the flames
In such a lovely sound, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's true
I'd never been alive
I was born to be a rocker and a rocker I'll die
It's true

[Chorus]
Let me dance like a bug on a cinema screen!
Shake my hand at the world and its pyramid schemes!
I'm in love with the groove and the gravy loves me!
Oh, mom, I've got the heart of a dancer!
