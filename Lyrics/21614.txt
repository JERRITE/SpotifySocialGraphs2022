More Than Love (Sofi Tukker Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a battle, at least they told me so
How to surrender, sometimes I never know
The walls up around me, they seem to never fall
Lend me some fire so I can burn 'em all
I know we've been struggling but hey, we've gotta move
I can still see you now, can you see me too?
Remember the rivers and how they merged our hearts
Never apart

[Chorus 1]
'Cause we came for morе than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for morе than love (More than love, more than love)
We came for more than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for more than love (More than love, more than love)
[Verse 2]
I can feel the fear on every single breath
Sometimes I feel like I can't take another step
But darling, I'm a soldier
I know that you're a soldier
So let's climb up this mountain and get over
All the things that keep us in the shadows, girl
I intend to cut 'em out of both our worlds
The mirror of the heart, it never lies
Gotta purify our eyes and shine

[Chorus 1]
'Cause we came for more than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for more than love (More than love, more than love)
We came for more than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for more than love (More than love, more than love)

[Chorus 2]
(More than love)
We came for more than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for more than love
More than love
We came for more than love
So baby girl, don't you run
We came for more than love
More than loveYou might also likeEmbed
