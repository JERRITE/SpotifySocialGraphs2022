Nothingâ€™s Real But Love LyricsStanding in a line, wonder why it don't move
Tryna get a hand, watching people break the rules
Maybe the man in charge, doesn't like my face
But then this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house
No car is like love

They watch us open bottles, as we joke around like fools
See who can be the worst, watch what I can do
But then the door gets slammed, slammed right in my face
And I guess, this world's not always good
And nothing's real but love, nothing's real but love
And no money, no house, no car is like love
It won't fill you up, no money, no house, no car, is like love
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah

I put it all away, holding it back for a rainy day
But what if that day don't come, I need love
Cause no money, no house, no car, is like love
It don't fill you up, it won't build you up, it won't fill you up

It's not love and nothing's real without love
And no money, no house, no car is like love
Nothing's real but love
And no money, no house, no car is like loveYou might also likeEmbed
