Not My Friends Lyrics[Hook: A-Reece]
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends
Them is not my guys, I do not know them
Who let them inside, I ain't call 'em in
Them not my friends, them is not my friends

[Verse 1: A-Reece]
Whole lotta ice on me I'm a polar bear
Only on a patience though, only now and then
Yeah, lit like Ric that one from the Flair
They took the elevator while I took the stairs
Now I got endurance guess they muscles tear
Getting money with my woes I make enough to share
Woes is not my friends though they fuckin' family
Yeah, working off the phone I pay myself a salary
I don't fuck with them plus I can't pretend
I heard what they said, I know why they mad at me
But since well I'm a God that shit is blasphamy
Catch me in the VI section rolling cannabis
[Hook: A-Reece]
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends
Them is not my guys, I do not know them
Who let them inside, I ain't call 'em in
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends

[Verse 2: A-Reece]
Whole lotta sprite pour it to the fuckin' brim
They like "what you want from us?"
I'm like "not a thing."
I could cop her what she want but I won't cop a ring
And she can ride it how she want but she ain't getting kids (nah!)
Look at what I did motherfucker listen
I don't know if you catching L's or just ain't tryn'a win
Came through with the squad, stole the show
Crime pays nigga
Tony Hawk fresh on my ride like I skate nigga

[Hook: A-Reece]
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends
Them is not my guys, I do not know them
Who let them inside, I ain't call 'em here
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends (nah!)
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends (nah!)
Them is not my guys, I do not know them
Who let them inside, I ain't call 'em here
Them is not my friends, them is not my friends

Them is  not my guys, them is  not my friends

Them is  not my friends, them is not my friend (nah!)
