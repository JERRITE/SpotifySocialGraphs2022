Bumper Cars Lyrics[Verse 1: Both]
Can't help wondering
What you're thinking
Wherever you are
Late night movies
Careless drinking
To cover these scars

[Pre-Chorus 1: Both]
And as much as I wanna be with you
I know
[Chorus: Both]
You and me, we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart
No, 'round and 'round, we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to
Is a pile of broken parts

[Post-Chorus: Both]
We're bumper cars, bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart

[Verse 2: Both]
Good intentions
All these questions
I'm sittin' alone
All roads since you
Are wrong directions
I'll never get home

[Pre-Chorus 2: Both]
And it's making me wanna be with you
I know

[Chorus: Both]
You and me, we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart
No, 'round and 'round, we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to
Is a pile of broken parts

We're bumper cars, bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart

[Bridge: Alex, Sierra, Both]
This was supposed to be fun
This was supposed to be the one
Maybe we stayed too long
Maybe we played all wrong
This was supposed to be good
But I know, I know

[Chorus: Alex, Sierra]
You and me, we're bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart
No, 'round and 'round, we chase the sparks
But all that seems to lead to
Is a pile of broken parts

[Post-Chorus: Both]
We're bumper cars, bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart
We're bumper cars, bumper cars
The more I try to get to you
The more we crash apart10Embed
