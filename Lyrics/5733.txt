Imagining Lyrics[Verse 1]
Close my eyes
'Cause here
Don't have to be controlling my desires
In my mind
It's us
And staying here is better than real life

[Pre-Chorus]
I live a lie, live a lie every night
Every night, every night on my mind
A fantasy I like I know isn't right
But staying here is better than real life
[Chorus]
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it out
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it out

[Verse 2]
Do you feel the same?
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you thinking of me now
Whispering your name
What would happen if I thought of you out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
I live a liе, live a lie evеry night
Every night, every night on my mind
A fantasy I like I know isn't right
But staying here is better than real life

[Chorus]
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it out
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it out

[Chorus]
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it out
I'm imagining, i-imagining
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you now
I'm imagining, i-imagining
And I'm hoping you'll figure it outEmbed
