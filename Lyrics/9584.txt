Cross My Mind Lyrics[Chorus]
I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Verse 1]
All the days you spend on my mind
All the times that I'd say that we'll be together, we'll be together, oh
All the ways you see through my heart
I know the good intentions, they won't last forever, won't last forever
[Chorus]
And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Verse 2]
All the hours we've spent on the line
All the times that you'd say that I never listen, I never listen
Through the conversations we've had 'til 4 AM
You say you want something different, want something different

[Chorus]
And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Not a single day goes by where you don't cross my
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mindYou might also like2Embed
