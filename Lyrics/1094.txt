TranslationsEspañolPurpose (Stripped) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We cry, we fight, yeah
But I know it's worth the pain
With your mind, and my crazy
It’s impossible to change, yeah
'Cause I tried to find
Something better, but I won't
When you kiss my cheek
It sends me to another place, ah

[Chorus]
Where no one can tear this away
I know she does it on purpose
Oh, it’s such a bitter game
The real you surfaced
Oh, the way she says my name
And there's no escaping
Oh, no complications
I know she does it on purpose
And if I let her go, I'll be insane
[Verse 2]
I'm all out of questions
So the silence overtakes
And it paints a perfect picture
Of who we are 'cause we're the same
To the way that you looked to me
And knew exactly what I was thinking
And I know that you're dangerous
But that's the risk that I will take

[Chorus]
No one can tear this away
I know she does it on purpose
Oh, it’s such a bitter game
The real you surfaced
Oh, the way she says my name
And there’s no escaping
Oh, no complications
I know she does it on purpose
And if I let her go, I'll be insane

[Bridge]
’Cause life as it goes, everyone knows
You gotta make your own
With you by my side, I swear that I
Will never let you go
And I could've chosen any path that's open
But you make it easy, you make it easy
You might also like[Chorus]
I know she does it on purpose
Always such a bitter game
The real you surfaced
Oh, the way she says my name
And there's no escaping
Oh, no complications
I know she does it on purpose
And if I let her go, I’ll be insane
(If I let her go I'll be insane)
I know she does it on purpose
And if I let her go, I'll be insaneEmbed
