Place In Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hold on, I never meant you any harm
Got no legs to stand on
I was just dancin' in the dark
Now with my eyes wide open
It's Heaven in your arms, hmm
Hold on, I never meant to start a war
I was just dead wrong
I know we've been in this before
Now with my eyes wide open
I tore you right apart, ah-ah-hmm
[Chorus]
Call me in the morning
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down, ah-ah-ah
I'm so apathetic it's pathetic
But I need you now, now

[Verse 2]
Sun's gone, but you always liked this time of day
No words left to play on
How many chances does it take?
Now with my eyes wide open
I'm nothing but a fake

[Chorus]
Call me in the morning
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down, ah-oh, ah
I'm so apathetic it's pathetic
But I need you now, now

[Bridge]
Hmm
Don't you move
Can't we just stay?
Can we start over?
Don't fade away

'Cause you'll always have a place in me (Hmm)
You'll always have a place in me7Embed
