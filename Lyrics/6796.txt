Auto Pistol Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, the pistol on me, but my vision cloudy
Keep them Glicks around me, he don't know shit about me
Oh, you a rich nigga? Let it hit, rip through the Audi
Hit up lil' folks, four-double-O, when I got dip through Cali

[Verse 1]
Bitches know me, niggas too, no Mick Foley, who is you?
How many niggas you got wit' you?
If it's more than like three, then I'm shooting a few
You lookin', who?
Bitch, we hit your roof with this shit
Knock a goof off his shit, knock your tooth loose and shit
I don't gotta brag, he ain't got no bag
He act like a fag, the body hit, get dragged, get it?
I finna pull out the mag and then rip it
The semi become automatic, I switch it
Get sent your location, I'm mapping it instant
I clap from a distance, the SPAS keep missing
Ten-cap, drilling shit, had me tripping
And I'm on the low, so imagine me slipping
And she wanna fly to the Vega from Britain
I told that bitch "Only if my bitch with it"
I just sent lil' mama a picture, and she replied said
"You ain't fit the description"
Might fuck around and start pimpin' this ho
She be popping the pussy like it's a prescription
Pop like a bully, it never stop picking
Glock and the hoodie, I never stop tripping
.33 in it, I'm calling it Pippen
Be with the bad boys, call it a piston
Fuck with the gang, that's a suicide mission
You causing a premeditated affliction
In my prediction, you is a victim
Get wet with the metal, I shoot down your system
He got some caskets, fuck nigga, pick one
No, I can't get in there with you, it fit one
Big gun, big drum, if you wan' get some
Only 5'8 baby giving me 6'1
She on my dick, huh, heard she got big tongue
You ain't my bitch, give a fuck if the bitch cum
Capital punishment, feeling like Big Pun
I just shoot shit with this gun, it ain't been done
[Chorus]
Riding 'round the city with a felony, felony
I can't hear the shit that you telling, telling me
Riding 'round the city with a felony, felony
I can't hear the shit that you telling me
Ayy, uh, uh
Riding 'round the city with a felony, felony
I can't hear the shit that you telling, telling me
Keep the stick, know I'm good for you like celery
Hickory Dickory, blowing a blickity
No magic trick when he disappear instantly

[Verse 2]
Play with position, I show you the symmetry
Show you the energy
Usually, keep it composed for my enemies
Don't even approach if you holding it timidly
I see the fuck shit in your demeanor
Uh, lil' nigga, I can read you
Body language deeper
He don't get no deeper
Simplistic, we are not interested
In a collab, I want none of you niggas
Why would I stand in front of you niggas?
Why would I go and give money to niggas?
Don't even know what I done to these niggas
Yeah, I got bad news, I ain't done with these niggas
You can get turned, but you will get burned
If you stand too long, I'm the sun of these niggas
Traumatized, I'm high, plenty inside
I hope to leave a landmine where the enemy hide
No Yosemite, I'm just Sam, you gon' remember these times
Don't you try to come by just timidly slide
Times five, I high rise, I'm not acknowledging the fuck shit
Fuck sick, I got the AIDS, I'm not the one to fuck with
I realized I'm not kin to these guys
Like the nigga that shot John, I invented these crimes, IYou might also likeEmbed
