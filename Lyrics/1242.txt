Either You Love Me Or You Donâ€™t Lyrics[Verse 1]
What do you want?
Where do I stand?
You know what it does when you hold my hand
I wish I didn't feel it
I'm opening up
Saying too much
Led me to believe that there was more to us
But you've been keeping
Secrets
The look in your eyes
Thought that I had you
Honest I can't even look at you
Don't avoid me something you've gotta
Say
[Chorus]
Either you're in or out
Either I'm with or without
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't
Either it's yes or no
Either you stay or I go
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong
But what if I'm right?
You told me that we could sit and talk all night
Then all you say is
Silence
Maybe it's me
But what if it's you
It isn't what you did
It's what you didn't do
You never once
Denied us

[Chorus]
Either you're in or out
Either I'm with or without
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't
Either it's yes or no
Either you stay or I go
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't

[Bridge]
So just
Let me know
Or let me go again
If it's the end
Let me know
Or let me go again
If it's the end

[Chorus]
Either you're in or out
Either I'm with or without
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't
Either it's yes or no
Either you stay or I go
You will or you won't
Either you love me or you don't
