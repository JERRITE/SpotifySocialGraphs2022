One More Day (Nicky Romero Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me we'll be alright whatever I might do
I may disappoint you 'cause I'm the one who always messes up everything
Being with me is like walking on a tightrope
So bring all of your hope, I think that I was born with broken wings

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I had to start a fire
Just tell me now, where to go
It's down or even higher
[Chorus]
If I promise you that I won't fuck up
From now on I'll be better forever
And I promise you that I will stay focused
Only you in my bed, like I once said
But only if you stay and help me find a way
But if I promise you that I won't fuck up
For now I will be better for ever
At least for one more day

For one more day

[Instrumental Drop: Nicky Romero]

[Verse 2]
Every time that I try pretending I'm a good girl
Like I'm in a fake world, maybe I just don't have what it takes

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I had to start a fire
Just tell me now, where to go
It's down or even higher

[Chorus]
If I promise you that I won't fuck up
From now on I'll be better forever
And I promise you that I will stay focused
Only you in my bed, like I once said
But only if you stay and help me find a way
But if I promise you that I won't fuck up
For now I will be better for ever
At least for one more day
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
For one more day
For one more day
For one more day
