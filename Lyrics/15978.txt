Truth Lyrics(Chorus)

If you wanna know the truth
Then come and talk to me now
I got eighty on my wrist
Now I’m the talk of the town
I’m the truth
I’m the truth
I just left without my roof
If you wanna know the truth
Then come and look me in my eyes
I’m a legend in disguise
I’ll be a legend when I die
Cuz I’m the truth
Look at me and see the proof
(Verse 1)

I just glide on em
I do the 2 step then I’m gone
I get to high on em
I take two pulls
And then I’m blown
That’s how I’m cut
She wanna ask me
What’s inside my cup
I said your luck
So take a sip baby
See what you got in store
I’ll make a private school virgin
Quickly turn to a whore
I’ll make a mute from Colorado
Start to scream give me more
And that’s for sure
Pop a molly while I’m sippin liquor
Just give me head
But promise me
You will not head for the door
I love you baby
But you won’t hear me
Say that often
The people saying I’m a don
All the way from Boston
I never lost
I pay the cost
So proceed with caution
I heard her ass from Calabasas
But those tits from Austin
You might also like(Chorus)

If you wanna know the truth
Then come and talk to me now
I got eighty on my wrist
Now I’m the talk of the town
I’m the truth
I’m the truth
I just left without my roof
If you wanna know the truth
Then come and look me in my eyes
I’m a legend in disguise
I’ll be a legend when I die
Cuz I’m the truth
Look at me and see the proof

(Verse 2)

Blue face hunnids
Stackin taller than toddlers
Half these bitches call me daddy
Knowin I’m not their father
I’m too selfish for a child
Plus I party too wild
I pop a bean to start my day
Then snort a line to run miles
I’m like Forrest Gump walkin
Cuz my pockets obese
I took a break from killing rappers
Just to hop on the beat
Don’t tell me shit
Come suck this dick
Before you suck on my feet
I’m a dirty motha fucka
Someone get me some bleach
I tell the truth
Even when I lie
Don’t act too surprised
These rappers faker than a maniquin
Take off your disguise
Look in my eyes
And you can see
That I’m a one of a kind
Fantastic
I bet you’ll look
But bet you won’t find
(Chorus)

If you wanna know the truth
Then come and talk to me now
I got eighty on my wrist
Now I’m the talk of the town
I’m the truth
I’m the truth
I just left without my roof
If you wanna know the truth
Then come and look me in my eyes
I’m a legend in disguise
I’ll be a legend when I die
Cuz I’m the truth
Look at me and see the proofEmbed
