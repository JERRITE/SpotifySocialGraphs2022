TranslationsPortuguÃªsUp On The Downside Lyrics[Verse 1]
This England made me between the war and rockets flying
And from the crib, it saves me and teach me wrong and right
The world was talking, it never got its chance to say
'Cause too much talking, nobody hears a word you say

[Chorus]
You won't see and baby now I won't hear
These blind communications only last throughout the year
And half of what we're saying is half-way inner truth
And blind communications for a million hearts and fools
[Verse 2]
I am a witness to a land of a million fools
All placing bets on life and hate the ones who lose
And all who lonely never get the chance to say
That the one and only would be the chance to even play

[Chorus]
You won't see and baby now I won't hear
These blind communications only last throughout the year
And half of what we're saying is half-way inner truth
And blind communications for a million hearts and fools

[Verse 3]
Hello Monday, the weekends just a blur
I been burning bridges and now I'm begging at your door
So keep on working cos it's a chance for me to play
Too much talking when you believe the words I say

[Chorus]
You won't see and baby now I won't hear
These blind communications only last throughout the year
And half of what we're saying is half-way inner truth
Blind communications for a million hearts and foolsYou might also like1Embed
