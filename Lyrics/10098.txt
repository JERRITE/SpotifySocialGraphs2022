Dark Skin Lyrics[Elijah Blake:]
It's not quite jungle fever
More of a forest cough
It's my slight tan against your Angel Soft
Dark skin
Dark skin

So let your full moon
Eclipse my sunlight
And light a fire so deep
Deep in your midnight
Da-a-ark skin
Dark skin
Skin
(Baby yeah)
Chocolate super supple
Juicy booty bubble
Diamond in the rubble
Dam I swear I love your
Dark skin

So let me blend
This melanin
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
That chocolate complexion
My hands at 2 and 10
I'm bout to drive it in
Drive it in
Drive it in

Dark skin
Your dark skin
Your dark skin
Your dark skin
I'm loving your dark skin

[D Smoke:]
Do that shit melt when she heat it up
We got find out if she keep it up
Chocolate caramel or peanut butter
She the favorite
She favor her mother
She raised a strong sense of self-confidence
Rock braids in her hair she fair with no competition
She shaped like a pear her derriere high sitting right
She be like gimme days
I be like gimme nights
Do you know that your melanin is fire
Do you know you set the bar higher
The shit they frustrated with to you is light work
Immune to all the bull no thanks to Pfizer
Its obvious now that the sun is our friend
The world that we know can no longer pretend
Like you ain't the source of where it all began
When we need the spark
We look at your beautiful dark skin

Chocolate complexion
My hands at 2 and 10
I'm bout to drive it in
Drive it in

Dark skin
Your dark skin
(Ooohh)
Your dark skin
(Caramel baby yeah)
Your dark skin
(Would you want to be anything else)
I'm loving your dark skin

[Muni Long:]
Black queen I am
That I am baby
If you think I'm thinking of your opinion of me
I know you crazy
Plus I know fucking perfect
Ass sitting titties perking
Property over a Burken
Give it to me I'm worth it
(You can give me that too though)
Black skin
Black queen

Black queen
Black skin
Black queen your everythingEmbed
