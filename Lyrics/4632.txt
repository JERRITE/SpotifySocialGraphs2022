Hot Water Tank Lyrics[Intro: ICECOLDBISHOP]
How much you want for it?
What I want for what?
Ah, it's just a water tank
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1: ICECOLDBISHOP]
Back and forth, shell casings scattered 'cross the concrete
Pass the torch, bullet fragments splash across your mom Jeep
Eatin' Chinese inside the hooptie, bitch, we five deep
And right beside me, a semi-automatic nine piece
Niggas killed my cousin, so it's fuck you, I deny peace
Scope police dogs sniffin', hide the weed inside of my sneaks
Caught that Twitter talkin' nigga slippin', now I'm geeked
Baby, hand that towel to wipe that nigga blood off my fleece
He got a hawk, but trade it for my blazеr just like Rasheed
I shifted to the D with еxtra pieces, bitch, I'm tryna eat
Until I make like twenty-five, I keep like ten racks set aside
Just for a rainy day, in case I gotta keep a play alive
Got a throwaway inside the truck, it's a full time job to try to stay alive
And if a fuck nigga gettin' out of line, he gettin' hogtied with a Christmas light, motherfucker
[Interlude: Boldy James]
If they get out of line, baow
You see, this, this water tank
You're a fiend beyond comprehension
Weak, junkie, rat
Where we at?
For example

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
They call me Bo Jack 'cause I run pills and I dump base (Yeah)
Whole battle was an uphill climb, nigga had to grind it out like the front breaks (Bricks)
Work a nine-to-five, no lunch breaks, nigga tryna open up the flood gates (Where we at with it?)
Like an uncut brick, all a nigga need is one take (Let's get it)
Take one, action (Ayy)
Me and Swally had three bodies on the same gun 'fore they snatched him (Bro-bro)
Now we live at the Franklin (Uh)
Held it down, kept it too real, 'fore he died, never got to thank him (At all)
Dog ranned off with the pack, caught him down bad and we spanked him (Grrt)
Burnin' opps in the Backwood, me and Jody in the Benzito (What else?)
Whole hood know about Lil' Dave, caught up with him, he finito
Off a buff mile like I'm Skitro, quatro, cinco, shells sing slow
Hit him two times with the Gleeko (Bah-bah), now he flyin' up Pico (Ayy)
With Guadalupe and Frederico (Yeah), 1942, Meek flow (Let's get it)
Turnin' kis to a soufflé, extra few K, get a free O (You know it)
Trap hard or go home, nigga had to use his shoebox for a bank
Fiend on his way to the scrapyard, he just stole another hot water tank
Where we at with it?

How much for that?
Ah, it's just a water tank1Embed
