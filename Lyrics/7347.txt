Okay then, wanna hear
I just wanna tell you a little story this little story
That my daddy used to tell me he was a king as well
I was born, probably about 68 years ago over by
That tree over there yeah
And I remember things changed a lot in those
Days, in Madagascar it wasn't so commercial, you know
There wasn't all the fuss bout who's got the latest tree
And what leaves
Are you wearing and who's got
The latest fur on their back you know
Those days it was just me and a couple of the others you
Know, doing the jungle boogie you know

Jungle boogie... jungle boogie
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
