Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woah-oh, oh mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the North and South and East

[Verse 2]
Woah-oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury
[Verse 3]
Oh oh, oh mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation underground, in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?You might also like13Embed
