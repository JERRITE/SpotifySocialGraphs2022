Take It or Leave It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, you should know by now that I’m right for you
But every time I step to you, you change your tune
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left
And there's no one else I'd rather die to myself

[Chorus]
Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it
[Verse 2]
Maybe I should pack my things and move on
Maybe I'm fooling myself and you're already gone
Watching the flames wither and fade
Trying to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down on my knees just praying that I can hold on

[Chorus]
Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm learning to unwind
I've been tripping over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it

[Bridge]
Baby, please, oh baby, please
Stay with me, or cut me free
It’s killing me

[Chorus]
Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave itYou might also like18Embed
