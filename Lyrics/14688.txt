Cantaloupe Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, don't, baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That, that cantaloupe
Th-th-th-tha-that cantaloupe
Baby don't, baby don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That-that, that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe

[Verse 1: Campa]
I be that shitty mother fucker, you hate him, but you love him
You took a million shots while I beat it on the buzzer
Fly, sittin' sideways, bitch, I'm on another
Gettin' high on a Friday, call me Mr. Tucker
Tucker ice cubes, chillin' in my ice room
Bitch I'm like a typhoon, kinda like a monsoon
I'm about to get you, wet you
Take you to the vet like an animal
Baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
[Verse 2: Cyrano]
Yo, it's that shitty mother fucker back up in the buildin'
Make that money buckle like the back of a Brazilian
Ah, Campa Cold, my brah, we the army
Gettin' cantaloupe from your Auntie, heard she got that donkey
Extra jalape√±o, sippin' on vino
My dick is on timber, tell her watch out below
Don't watch me, watch TV, livin' my dreams out while y'all sleep
While y'all freeze, I'm in beach clothes, chillin' in a beach cove
Mean flows, but I ain't PMS-in' (Nuh-uh)
PML, though, pretty much a legend (Uh-huh)
All these bitches stressin', but the money come first (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the pussy come second, man, it's time to go to work (Let's go, woo)

[Chorus]
Baby, don't, baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That, that cantaloupe
Th-th-th-tha-that cantaloupe (Woo)
Baby don't, baby don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That-that, that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe (Woo)
Baby, don't, baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That, that cantaloupe
Th-th-th-tha-that cantaloupe
Baby don't, baby don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That-that, that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe

Here we go, Cyrano back with the lyrical miracle
Campa, grab it
These bitches on my johnson (Why?)
'Cause I got that magic
It's tragic, I told these kids not to play in traffic
Don't get caught up in the fire when we come through Catarac-in'
Y'all be drivin', we be cabbin', we're cabbin' up in Cali
Where these pretty young girls like to show their hidden valley
I heard her name was Sally, but she go by Eden
And she got that Cantaloupe that's ripe in every season
And she, and she got that Cantaloupe that's ripe in every season

[Chorus]
Baby, don't, baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That, that cantaloupe
Th-th-th-tha-that cantaloupe (Woo)
Baby don't, baby don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That-that, that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe (Woo)
Baby, don't, baby, don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That, that cantaloupe
Th-th-th-tha-that cantaloupe (Woo)
Baby don't, baby don't act so sweet
Just give me that cantaloupe
That-that, that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe (Woo)
[Post-Chorus]
Give me that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe (Woo)
Give me that cantaloupe
Give me that, give me that cantaloupe
