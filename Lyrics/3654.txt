TranslationsEspañolLMLY Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't call me "Baby"
You call me my name
But I keep on hoping
Nothing has changed
Yeah-eah
We keep on touching
But we don't feel
Feels like you're letting
Your hands off the wheel
Ayy
[Pre-Chorus]
What if I just hold on for a while?
Baby, there's no drug quite like denial
Oh my, if this is goodbye

[Chorus]
Don't leave me loving you
But whatever you do
Don't leave me loving you
If you tip-toe out in the morning
I need a warning
If you don't feel it too
But whatever you do
Don't leave me loving you
If you're out of this when I'm all in
I need a warning

[Post-Chorus]
Don't leave me loving you, babe
Whatever you do, babе
Don't leave me loving you, babе
Ooh, babe

[Verse 2]
The sun is setting
In purple and blue
Is there no getting
Closer to you?
Yeah-eah
Waking up strangers
California King
Reaching out for you
To bring you to me
Yeah-eah-eah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
What if I just hold on for a while?
Baby, there's no drug quite like denial
Oh my, if this is goodbye

[Chorus]
Don't leave me loving you
But whatever you do
Don't leave me loving you
If you tip-toe out in the morning
I need a warning
If you don't feel it too
But whatever you do
Don't leave me loving you
If you're out of this when I'm all in
I need a warning

[Post-Chorus]
Don't leave me loving you, babe
Whatever you do, babe
Don't leave me loving you, babe
Whatever you do, babe
Don't leave me loving you, babe
Whatever you do, babe
Don't leave me loving you, babe
Ooh, babe
[Chorus]
Don't leave me loving you
But whatever you do
Don't leave me loving you
If you tip-toe out in the morning
I need a warning

[Outro]
Don't leave me loving you2Embed
