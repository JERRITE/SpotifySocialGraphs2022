Ch-Ching Lyrics[Refrain]

[Verse 1]
Nobody will help you 'til you go and help yourself
Take it and don't wait for it to come from someone else
I've got everything I need right here, between my hands
And there it is right in front of me...
[Chorus]
Take a look at me
Who'd have thought I'd be
The one that got away with it
I got a way with it
They showed me a fantasy
I stole it for you and me
Tripped it, switch, flipped it
Slow dripped it, unzipped it
I flipped it
[Post-Chorus]
Getting what you want can be dangerous (uh-oh)
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret (uh-oh)
And pass it back under the table to me
I put the stash in the bookshelf (uh-oh)
Open your mouth and I'll slip you the key
Now crack that combination (uh-oh)
Like 27-99-23

Take a look at me
Who'd have thought I'd be
The one that got away with it
I got a way with it
They showed me a fantasy
I stole it for you and me
Tripped it, switch, flipped it
Slow dripped it, unzipped it
I flipped it

[Post-Chorus]
Getting what you want can be dangerous (uh-oh)
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret (uh-oh)
And pass it back under the table to me

[Bridge]
If nobody sees it then nobody knows
I beg for forgiveness, not permission
The music ain't playing 'til you listen

[Post-Chorus]
Getting what you want can be dangerous
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret
And pass it back under the table to me
I put the stash in the bookshelf
Open your mouth and I'll slip you the key
Now crack that combination like 27-99-23
