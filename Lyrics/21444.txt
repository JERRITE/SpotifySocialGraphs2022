When You Told Me You Loved Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once
Doesn't mean anything to me
Come
Show me the meaning of complete
Where
Did our love go wrong?
Once we were so strong
How can I go on?

[Chorus]
When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right?
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run?
Baby, I thought you were the one
[Verse 2]
Why
Can't I just leave it all behind?
I
Felt passion so bright that I was blind
Then
Something made me weak
Talking in my sleep
Baby, I'm in so deep, and you know I believed

[Chorus]
When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right?
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run?
Baby, I thought you were the one

[Bridge]
Your lips, your face
Something that time just can't erase
My heart could break
All over again
You might also like[Chorus]
When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right?
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run?
Baby, I thought you were the one1Embed
