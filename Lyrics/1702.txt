Xtasy (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Ecstasy for the free, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Turn the heat, can you keep up? Oh-oh, oh, oh
(Enough, you got it, come on)
Ecstasy for the free, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Oh, woah)
(It's for the free)
Turn the heat, can you keep up? Oh
(Enough, you got it, come on)

[Post Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Throw your hands high, don't think too much
Put 'em in the sky and feel that rush
Oh (Turn the heat)
If we're going higher, feel my touch
The moon is shining down on us (Ecstasy)
[Verse 1: Ravyn Lenae]
If you're down, then I'll take you, love
My skin is so hot
I can barely breathe, I can't see
Surround me and take me up
Let's see what you got
Every heart, it beats over me
If you wanna go, then I'll meet you on the floor
Tell the DJ bye
If you ever change your mind
Keep your focus and reawaken
If you wanna know, then I'll open up a door to a fever high
I'ma hit you one more time, can't control it (I'm only taking)

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Ecstasy for the free, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Turn the heat, can you keep up? Oh
(Enough, you got it, come on)

[Post-Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Throw your hands high, don't think too much
Put 'em in the sky and feel that rush
Oh (Turn the heat)
If we're going higher, feel my touch
The moon is shining down on us (Ecstasy)

Ecstasy, you're next to me
Next pussy compared to me, no
Wet, hurricane like it's Katrina
On one knee but I speak prenups
Don't avoid it, you're in my vortex
Dora, explorer, inside my cervix
Fuck the morals, I just need your sex
Boy, pull over, I just need one sec
You put the X in ecstasy
You the reason I'm a freak
You be fucking up my weave
You the oxygen I breathe in
The only one, I wanna cuff you every season
The only nigga I believe in
You put the X in ecstasy
You the reason I'm a freak
You be fucking up my weave
You the oxygen I breathe in
The only one, I wanna cuff you every season
The only nigga I believe in

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
Ecstasy for the free, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Turn the heat, can you keep up? Oh
(Enough, you got it, come on)
You ready?
[Bridge: Ravyn Lenae]
Ecstasy, I wanna go high
I'm open, tonight I'm on fire
We're touching, your body on mine
Ecstasy, you're next to me
Ecstasy, we're takin' it slow
Can't you see I'm losing control?
How far will you go?
Ecstasy, you're next to me

[Outro: Ravyn Lenae]
Ecstasy
Enough, you got it
Can you keep up? (Enough, you got it)
Enough, you got it
Can you keep up? (Enough, you got it)Embed
