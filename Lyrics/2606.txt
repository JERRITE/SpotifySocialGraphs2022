Stick to the Status Quo Lyrics[Verse 1: Zeke, Ensemble]
You can bet there's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control
Everybody gather 'round

[Dialogue: Zeke (spoken), Chad (spoken), Ensemble]
Well, if Troy can tell his secret, then I can tell mine
I bake
What?
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy
Not another sound
Someday, I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée!
[Chorus: Ensemble]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo

[Verse 2: Martha, Ensemble]
Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare
But, inside, I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep

[Dialogue: Martha (spoken), Brainiac (spoken), Ensemble]
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break
Is that even legal?
Not another peep
It's just dancing! Sometimes, I think it's cooler than homework

[Chorus: Ensemble]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo

Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly
Speak your mind and you'll be heard

[Dialogue: Skater #1 (spoken), Skater #2 (spoken), Ensemble]
Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm comin' clean
I play the cello!
Awesome! What is it?
A saw?
No, dude, it's like a giant violin
Not another word
Do you have to wear a costume?
Coat and tie

[Chorus: Ensemble]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo, oh
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
[Verse 4: Sharpay, Ryan, Both]
This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Something is really—
Something's not right!
Really wrong
And we gotta get things back where they belong


[Verse 5: Sharpay & Ryan, Skater #1, then Martha, then Zeke, Ensemble]
We can do it
Gotta play
Stick with what you know
We can do it
Hip hop, hooray
She has got to go
We can do it
Crême brûlée!
Keep your voice down low
Not another peep, no
Not another word, no
Not another sound, no

[Dialogue: Sharpay (spoken), Gabriella (spoken), Taylor (spoken)]
Everybody, quiet!
Why is everybody staring at you?
Not me. You
Because of the callbacks?
I can't have people staring at me, I really can't

[Chorus: Ensemble]
No!
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know (Stick to the stuff you know)
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo, oh
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know (Stick to the stuff you know)
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status—
Stick to the status—
Stick to the status quo6Embed
