Fresh as a Daisy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, if you come from Heaven
You know that that's okay
Just as long as you're here to help me
It doesn't matter how long you stay

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
[Verse 2]
Well, tell me, can you feel it?
I'm felling alright myself
I'm changing my old habits
And I've found a new bill of health

[Chorus]
All because of you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
As fresh as a daisy?

[Bridge]
You do the things you do very well
You make me feel the way I've never felt
You make me feel the way I've never felt

[Verse 3]
Don't know how I'll feel tomorrow
Tomorrow's another day
I like everything about you
What more is there to say?

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
