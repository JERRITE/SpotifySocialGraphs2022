Toot That Lyrics[Intro]
(Damn, Sarge, you made that?)

[Chorus: Erica Banks]
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, go and beat too
Roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club
[Verse 1: Erica Banks]
I told him get back, back up 'less you got them racks up
Ain't no competition, tell them other bitches catch up
Throw it in rotation, make that nigga get up on it, bitch
Do it like you nasty, do it like you own it, bitch
Thick ass, got a lil' junk to it (Junk to it)
Big booty, got a lil' bump to it (Bump to it)
Throw it back quick, he'll run to it (Uh)
Got a lot of ones, he'll run through it, ayy (Okay)
Dump it on the dick like this, uh (Like this)
Dump it on the dick like that, ayy (Like that)
Teased how you want, get pleased how you want (Uh)
Drop it down and throw it right back, ayy (Hah)

[Chorus: Erica Banks & BeatKing]
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, you a dancer
Ride on it, don't get tired on it, ooh, he handsome
Slide on it, take your time on it, you a freak too
Rise on it, put them thighs on it, go and beat too
Roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that, roll that nigga up (Up), roll that nigga up
Roll that nigga up, throwin' ass in the club (Yeah, hold up)

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
Pop that cat at me, turn around, look back at me (Hold up)
I'm tryna beat it up, she say, "Throw a stack at me" (Ooh)
Psych, you retarded, trick, you know I got the 40 (Huh?)
I gave her counterfeit money 'cause I see that girl been snortin' (Yeah)
Throw that ass back on the bitch you came with (Toot that)
You a thot, you smashed my bro, you can't explain this (Toot that)
Pop that pussy on the Snap, I make her famous (Toot that)
When I hit DGs, Wayne, he gon' play this (Hold up)
