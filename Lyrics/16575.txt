We Are the Young LyricsTake me down the road
Take me where you need me
To will all their arms
Hold me like they love me

Calm down, calm down
When all their eyes are on me
Calm down, Calm down
When all their eyes are cold

For all the ones,holding on
We share the same blood
We are the young
Walk me down the road
Pick me up or tear me down
They'll take it all
Quikly to abandon

Calm down, calm down
When all their eyes are on me
Calm down, calm down
When all their eyes are cold

For all the ones, holding on
We share the same blood
We are the young
For all the ones, holding on
We share the same blood
We are the young

Is there ever enough?
Is there ever enough to go by?

For all the ones, holding on
We share the same blood
We are the young
For all the ones, holding on
We are the same
We are
For all the ones , holding on
We are the same
We are, we are the youngYou might also likeEmbed
