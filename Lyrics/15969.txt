Worst Kind of Hurt Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been spending all my time
Wishing we'd be forever
Imagining you're mine
That we were together
But we were in different places the whole time
We lost the war, but never even had a fight
I wish you made me hate you when we said goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
The worst kind of hurt
The kind that just burns
Is when there's no good reason
It didn't work
When you'rе still in love
But it's not enough
And nothing's evеn wrong
But you wish it was
[Chorus]
You didn't hurt me
I didn't hurt you
I still want you
But we don't want the same things
We can't be what we were
But I'll always be yours

[Post-Chorus]
That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah), worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah)
(Worst kind of hurt)
That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah), worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah)
(Worst kind of hurt)

[Verse 2]
You could have cheated or lied
You could have just made it easy
But I know that you tried
And I tried, and we tried, but sometimes
There's nothing you can do
I swear that

[Pre-Chorus]
The worst kind of hurt (The worst)
The kind that just burns
Is when there's no good reason
It didn't work (Oh)
When you're still in love
But it's not enough
And nothing's even wrong
But you wish it was (You wish it was)
You might also like[Chorus]
You didn't hurt me
I didn't hurt you
I still want you
But we don't want the same things
We can't be what we were
But I'll always be yours (I'll always be yours)

[Post-Chorus]
That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah), worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah)
(Worst kind of hurt)
That's the worst kind of
Worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah), worst kind of hurt (Ah-ah)
(Worst kind of hurt)

[Outro]
But we were in different places the whole time
We lost the war, but never even had a fight
I wish you made me hate you when we said goodbyeEmbed
