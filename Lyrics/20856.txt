Donâ€™t Talk to Strangers LyricsDon't talk to strangers

Don't talk to strangers
Cause they're only there
To do you harm
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real

Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key
That opens up your soul
Don't go to Heaven
Cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug
To make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
Cause they'll only bring you down

Hey you, you know me
You've touched me, I'm real, I'm forever
The one that lets you look and see
And feel me

I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane, don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind, yeah
Run away, run away, go

No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real

(Don't talk to strangers)
Cause they're only there
To make you sad
Don't dream of women
Cause they'll only bring you down

Run, run, run, run away3Embed
