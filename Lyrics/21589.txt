Best Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
So much harder to be honest
With yourself at twenty-somethin'
Wish I knew what I'm becomin'
And felt the ground while I was on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopin', waitin' on a moment
Not knowin' if it's comin' or it's goin', mm

[Chorus]
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm runnin' with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
If I'd known to fuеl the fire (Fire)
I would'vе thrown my arms up higher (Higher)
Woulda held on a little tighter
'Cause you don't know a thing you miss 'til it's behind you, mm

[Chorus]
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm runnin' with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?

What if the best days are the days I've left behind? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ah, ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh3Embed
