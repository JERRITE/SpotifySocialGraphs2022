Dancing In the Daylight Lyrics[One Two One Two Three
Alright
Dancing in the daylight
Dancing in the daylight]

[Verse 1]
Alone at the party, that's where it started
That's where it usually ends
But I caught you looking, at me from the kitchen
Having a drink with a friend
[Chorus]
I don't dance, I can't dance, I don't dance, when I'm sober
That's what she said, don't go to bed
But I've had a drink and the night's nearly over
But when I'm ahead now were dancing in the daylight
Yeah we are, she said kiss me when it feels right
So i did, it was quarter past midnight
When we met, now were dancing in the daylight
And we ain't finished yet

I've been waiting all my life for a night like this
And a midnight kiss
I've been waiting all my life for a girl like this
To share it with

Dance, dance, kiss me and dance
Dancing in the daylight, dance dance dance dancing in the daylight

[Verse 2]
Here in the moonlight, you got me so psyched
Don't want the night to end
'Cus I'd watch the sunrise, with you for a lifetime
And I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
I don't dance, I can't dance, I don't dance, when I'm sober
That's what she said, don't go to bed
But I've had a drink and the night's nearly over
But when I'm ahead now were dancing in the daylight
Yeah we are, she said kiss me when it feels right
So i did, it was quarter past midnight
When we met, now were dancing in the daylight
And we ain't finished yet
You might also likeI've been waiting all my life for a night like this
And a midnight kiss
I've been waiting all my life for a girl like this
To share it with

Dance, dance, kiss me and dance
Dancing in the daylight, dance dance dance dancing in the daylight

Now were dancing in the daylight
Yeah we are, she said kiss me when it feels right
So i did, it was quarter past midnight
When we met, now were dancing in the daylight
And we ain't finished yet

I've been waiting all my life for a night like this
And a midnight kiss
I've been waiting all my life for a girl like this
To share it with

Dance, dance, kiss me and dance
Dancing in the daylight, dance dance dance dancing in the daylightEmbed
