Play Along Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I didn't have to say this
Baby, you've been underneath my skin like I'm a [?], maybe
I just need to find someone to hang with
Everybody wants to leave me yeah that's why I'm standing, failing
Talking about yourself I get a headache
Every time I see you've got that look on your face
And I can't believe you make it up like I was crazy
I don't wanna play this
I don't got no time for any games
[Chorus]
Say you wanna go but now I'm proving you wrong
Apologizing for all the times that I wasn't enough
I got distracted and called you every single name in the book
And now I'm running from my feelings
That's why I'm taking the drugs
I could be your conscious
Say the way you're off if you need me I'ma be alright
Wish I wasn't gone
You know you've never say you're sorry
Wondering way too long
And now I'ma show to you it's alright
Well I just play along now
I just play along now
I just play along now
I just play along now
I just play along now

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of it (I'm sick of it)
Always put my hand out, but you always seem to forget
Calling me
Me have worked a few times
But I'll never do that again
Alright
I can't pretend it's alright
You lied
Sayin' it's all in my head
You might also likeWhy am I so afraid to say that
What I really feel, about you
How you're twisted
How your mind works
How I just play along with you
I just want to see right through you
[?]That vision that you used to
I just play along until you see what I see [?]
[?] The light and I only see the rearview

[Outro]
Your body is blinding me and you alwasy saver it yeah
I guess I just play along with you
Saying it's all in my head
Saying it's all in my headEmbed
