Between Lyrics[Chorus]
Where do we go when we close our eyes to sleep?
What makes an end if there is nothing in between?

[Verse]
Where do we go now?
Is it all inside my mind?
Did we get lost or found?
Between

[Drop]
Between
[Chorus]
Where do we go when we close our eyes to sleep?
What makes an end if there is nothing in between?

[Drop]
Between
Between

[Outro]
Where do we go when we close our еyes to sleep?
What makes an end if thеre is nothing in between?You might also likeEmbed
