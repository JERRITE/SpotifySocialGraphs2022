Getting Along Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can contemplate, but still I won’t remember
All the time it takes, can take until forever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You’re getting along without me
You’re waking up to keep
Getting along without me
And I finally see

[Chorus 1]
That I don’t wanna fall asleep 'cause then I won’t
See anything
And I don’t wanna close my eyes 'cause then I know
It only means
[Verse 2]
If I can concentrate, if I can just forget her
In the time it takes to think about forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It’s not the same in my dreams
And it’s different for me
You’re getting along without me
And I finally see

[Chorus 2]
That I don’t wanna fall asleep 'cause then I won’t
See anything
And I don’t wanna close my eyes 'cause then I know
It only means

[Verse 3]
When I wake up you won’t be here
When I wake up you won’t be here

[Pre-Chorus 3]
No one understands the reason why
I’ve been staying up awake at night
Think it’s right for me to try and work it out
But now I’m lying down
You might also like[Chorus 3]
And I don’t wanna fall asleep 'cause then I won’t
See anything
And I don’t wanna close my eyes 'cause then I know
It only means
That I don’t wanna fall asleep 'cause then I won’t
See anything
And I don’t wanna close my eyes 'cause then I know
It only means

[Outro]
When I wake up you won’t be here
When I wake up you won’t be nearEmbed
