Cocaine shawty, lookin' at me naughty
Met her at the party, now she all up on me
If you lookin' for me, posted with my .40
Cocaine shawty, touchin' on your body
(I'll do anything for some blow right now)
I only pull one-seated
Try to make me settle, boy, I call her on the weekend
Yeah, ouh, ayy, yeah, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Yunggoth✰]
Bentley dranks, quarter pound, I need it for the weekend, yeah
Live my life alone, that's why I only pull one-seated, ayy
Try to make me settle, boy, I call her on the weekend, yah
Danger when I want to, boy, you know it's Puerto Rican, ayy
Rifle on my Louboutins, what she call my shooter song
Xannie, ain't no foolin', boy, damn foreign shootin' star
Live and love, I die alone, pretty bitches in my phone
Skinny bitches in my home, cocaine shawty, give me dome
Cocaine shorty, wipe your nose, cocaine shawty, die alone
Cocaine shawty, cry alone, cocaine shawty, cry alone
Cocaine shawty, wipe your nose, cocaine shawty, die alone
Cocaine shawty, cry alone, cocaine shawty, yeah, yeah
