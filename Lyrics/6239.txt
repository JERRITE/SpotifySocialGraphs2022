Whatever forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out here all alone
Baby, we're not going home tonight
Can we dance under the stars
Until we get to Mars alright?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well right now there is no tomorrow
What if all this time is borrowed?
Better live it now
Before the time runs out
Day light
[Chorus]
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatever tonight
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatеver tonight
I don't really care about much, no
I just wanna havе some fun, let go
We'll be singing
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatever tonight

[Verse 2]
Bay a plane ticket
We can go anywhere we like
Rooftops is LA
New York
See the Tokyo lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Well right there is no tomorrow
What if all this time is borrowed
Better live it now
Before the time runs out
Day light
You might also like[Chorus]
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatever tonight
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatever tonight
I don't really care about much, no
I just wanna have some fun, let go
We'll be singing
Whatever forever
Whatever forever
Whatever tonightEmbed
