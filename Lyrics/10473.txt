On a Mountain Lyrics[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, VVS
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
Backend racks in, I need an accountant (Yuh), Cartier
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
Keep the Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Landed in LA, 3 hours, smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight hours in my Audi (Ayy)
[Verse 1]
That's on everything, everything, yeah
Walk in the mall buy everything
Everyday I change, Chanel strings
Play no games, Alexander Wang on her nail paint
Your drip insane, where the fuck my paint? Stop playin' games
Watch your range, my nut deranged, they actin' ways
Go get paid, the condo late, that Frito Lay (Lay)
Family straight, don't see no shade, the Dolce way
My new-new babe loves lemonade, like Beyonc√©
We the wave, ahh, flyin' out of PDK (PDK)
Smashin' in the Lamb I barely use the brakes (Use the brakes)
I'm in New Orleans on my birthday, I got Beaucoup cake (Beaucoup cake)
Gon' have to man that sail little harder for you to feel the lake

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, VVS
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
Backend racks in, I need an accountant (Yuh), Cartier
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
Keep the Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Landed in LA, 3 hours, smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight hours in my Audi (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, real slatt (Real slatt)
Uh, took your bitch, I'm smashin' her like my Hellcat (My Hellcat)
Do as I please I'm poppin' whatever I feel, yeah (I feel, yeah)
I crack a seal, pour up 'fore I throw this pill back (Pill back)
Like, slime, I keep a TEC, ain't finna get killed yet (Nah)
Life ain't Tom and Jerry, niggas some real rats (Real rats)
Thomas Ford on me when I ride that Maybach (That Maybach)
If you want some smoke, lil nigga, just say that (Just say that)
Gunna a fashion god my new nickname, Saks ('Name, Saks)
Nigga so cap I bought 'em a real hat (Real hat)
Throw dirt on my name, young Gunna don't play that (Don't play that)
Flood my bitch with drip, I still can't get attached (Can't get attached)
Hit her line and told her bring me that pussy cat

Four rings on my fingers, eight hours in my Audi (Ayy)4Embed
