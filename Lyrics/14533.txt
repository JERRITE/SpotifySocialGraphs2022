Rush The Floor Lyrics[Intro: Belly]
I'ma make you rush the floor
Fellas throw your hands up, ladies touch your toes
Look, I'm about to crush the floor
If they don't let us in we're gonna bust the door

[Hook: Massari]
Ay yo, I know that your feeling to stay close
First call me up, then maybe we can just lay low
Then we gotta dip out of here, and if they see you leave with me
They know, that your not on your way home
Im'a give you love then maybe we can just lay low
Shorty shorty tell me how you feel
Doing the things you did with me tonight
[Verse 1: Massari]
I know you want to ride with a soldier
These styles getting closer and closer
Yeah I keep my friends around me
Run and tell your friends about me
Make your body move like a cobra
And now you got me wishing I can show ya
All those things I could do, the things I would do
If you was with me

[Bridge: Massari]
You want me with you all the time
Thinking about me day and night
Baby I can trust you
I know you want the need to shine
Now your spending extra time
Just know that I know what your upto
All you wanna do is live my life from the get-go
If you love it then you never wanna let go
And all I wanna do is get mine from the get-go
If you with me then I gotta let you know

[Hook: Massari]
Ay yo, I know that your feeling to stay close
First call me up, then maybe we can just lay low
Then we gotta dip out of here
And if they see you leave with me
They know, that you're not on your way home
I'ma give you love then maybe we can just lay low
Shorty shorty tell me how you feel
Doing the things you did with me tonight

I'ma make you rush the floor

Look, I'm about to crush the floor
If they don't let us in we're gonna bust the door

[Verse 2: Belly]
I ain't getting commercial
I'm just hear vision impaired sipping on purple
I, Got nothing to lose
$50 Socks, hundred thousand dollar shoes
So even if she acting kinda rude
I'ma slide her through and show her what a rider do
She thought that she could never find a dude
This much ambition, I'm always on the move
Going fast tryna switch lanes, I'm Rick James
The gangster that spit game
And it ain't nothing like sick brain
Now I got you on the floor like Spike at a Knick game
Right beside me in the big range
Pinky worth three curve B on a sick chain
I know you dying to see
The way you look if you could ride with me
Mami

[Verse 3: Massari]
Shorty don't stop till its over
Watch, A gun and a rover
Girl I know you've heard about me
Must have heard the word about me
Now you wanna see what they told ya
And im'a show you over and over
And now that its time to let go, your not gon let go
You don't wanna leave...me
[Bridge: Massari]
You want me with you all the time
Thinking about me day and night
Baby I can trust you
I know you want the need to shine
Now your spending extra time
Just know that I know what your upto
All you wanna do is live my life from the get-go
If you love it then you never wanna let go
And all I wanna do is get mine from the get-go
If you with me then I gotta let you know

[Hook: Massari]
Ay yo, I know that your feeling to stay close
First call me up, Then maybe we can just lay low
Then we gotta dip out of here
And if they see you leave with me
They know, that you're not on your way home
I'ma give you love then maybe we can just lay low
Shorty shorty tell me how you feel
Doing the things you did with me tonight
Ay yo, I know that your feeling to stay close
First call me up, Then maybe we can just lay low
Then we gotta dip out of here
And if they see you leave with me
They know, that you're not on your way home
I'ma give you love then maybe we can just lay low
Shorty shorty tell me how you feel
Doing the things you did with me tonight

[Outro: Belly]
I'ma make you rush the floor
Fellas throw your hands up, ladies touch your toes
Look, I'm about to crush the floor (yeah)
If they don't let us in were gonna bust the door (owh)4Embed
