Come Clean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drawing hearts in the steam on the shower
There was screamin' and fightin' for hours
Say you love me, but some days you wish we never met
Fall asleep in my arms after midnight
I stay up wonderin' if it feels right
Say I love you, but some days I wish we never met

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have my doubts, my doubts
That you could let me down, me down
[Chorus]
So can you come clean?
Show me who you are, show me what you mean
'Cause I don't wanna have a doubt, a doubt
Can't you come clean?

[Drop]
(So can you) Come clean

[Verse 2]
I won't look, but I know how you're feelin'
Check your phonе, though I don't think you're cheatin'
Say I trust you, but some days I wish wе never met, oh
Yeah, you know that I love you forever
'Least the good fortune times we're together
Yeah, I love you, but some days I wish we never met, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have my doubts, my doubts
That you could let me down, me down

[Chorus]
So can you come clean?
Show me who you are, show me what you mean
'Cause I don't wanna have a doubt, a doubt
So can you come clean?
You might also like[Drop]
(So can you) Come clean
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
'Cause I have my doubts, my doubts
That you could let me down, me down
So can you come clean?

[Drop]
(So can you) Come cleanEmbed
