â€‹a letter to me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Used to be held captive by my fears
Shackles on my wrists like souvenirs
Lost myself in anything
Couldn't see the ending through my tears
Used to hold my tongue and play along
Only knew that I had to be strong
Lost my own identity
Didn't know what in my world was wrong

[Chorus]
Sugar-coated all my pain
Couldn't help it, I was just a kid then
Begging for a break
Now I'm twenty, pushing twenty-one
Hoping that I'll be someone
Running from the person I created when I had no one
Twenty, pushing anxiously
Hoping that I'll be happy
Writing to the person I wanna be
In a letter to me
In a letter to me
[Verse 2]
So, I'm done letting myself bleed
In a spiral of my own self-pity
I'm done searchin' for remedies in people who don't care about me
Yeah, there's a lot of things I don't know (Don't know, don't know)
But I know that I'm on my way
To finally bein' okay alone

[Chorus]
No more sugar-coated all my pain
Couldn't help it, I was just a kid
Begging for a break
Now I'm twenty, pushing twenty-one
Hoping that I'll be someone
Running from the person I created when I had no one
Twenty, pushing anxiously
Hoping that I'll be happy
Writing to the person I wanna be
In a letter to me
In a letter to me

[Outro]
