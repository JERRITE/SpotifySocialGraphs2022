TranslationsEspañol​i thought i died inside Lyrics[Chorus]
She make me feel alive, I thought I died inside
Why do I feel fine? Everything seems alright
She a ghost girl sending shivers down my spine
I only get to see her in the night time
I don't plan to stay so I'ma go
You've been down this road you know it never get's old
And we should fuck the pain away until our hearts cold
'Til we have no feelings 'cause we are growing old
You don't plan to stay then you should go
I've been down this road, no, it never get's old
And we should fuck the pain away until our hearts cold
'Til we have no feelings 'cause we are growing old
[Verse]
But sometimes life's like that
I don't wanna type back if I'm forced to fight back
(I'll just get a-) I'll just get a flight back home
Back to the rain to the green and the cold
Maybe I've just been home sick, but my home ain't shit
And my brain is a waste, fill it with a full clip
Maybe I've just been home sick, but my home ain't shit
And my brain is a waste, fill it with a full clip

[Chorus]
She make me feel alive, I thought I died inside
Why do I feel fine? Everything seems alright
She a ghost girl sending shivers down my spine
I only get to see her in the night time
I don't plan to stay so I'ma go
You've been down this road you know it never get's old
And we should fuck the pain away until our hearts cold
'Til we have no feelings 'cause we are growing old
You don't plan to stay then you should go
I've been down this road, no, it never get's old
And we should fuck the pain away until our hearts cold
'Til we have no feelings 'cause we are growing oldYou might also like9Embed
