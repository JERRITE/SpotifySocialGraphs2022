Richer Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
808 Mafia

[Chorus: Pi'erre Bourne]
Man, I miss my guys, this shit getting ugly (Hey)
Told my dawg, "We gon' be good, man nigga, trust me" (Hey)
When it's all said and done, she still gon' suck me (Hey)
Money fast, how it come? Like it rush me, hey
Yeah, but I want a bigger bag, want a bigger crib, hey
Want a bigger chain, hey, want the sickest whip, hey
Want some bigger shit, hey, when I'm bigger bitch, hey
We just nigga rich, hey, bitch, I'm nigga rich
[Verse 1: Pi'erre Bourne]
That nigga not cut like me, can't get no bucks like me
That's why I don't chill with them niggas, I rather get richer alonе
Yeah, I'ma home run hitter, yеah, I just be taking her home
And you is a phony nigga, man, you can't go back home
I be in the hood like every month, these niggas more pressed than the Claremont's
My life a movie, I'm Paramount, but it's some shit I don't share about
Tell me more shit I don't care about, I'm waiting on money, what Pi'erre about?
Can't be scared and stay in the house, used to throw parties and air it out
Now I'm up for a Grammy now, we got first not second down
Chase that town we gone throw it out, money like hair how I grow it out
I was on [?] for real, bitch I'm four for real
My nigga don't lift no weight, but he always holds the steel
My nigga done caught a case, they trying to give him ten years
Shawty showed the future fast, that past catches up for real
Introduce you to the bag, and we gone touch a 'mil
You know why my pockets fat, cause my bank like Uncle Phil's

[Chorus: Pi'erre Bourne]
Man, I miss my guys, this shit getting ugly (Hey)
Told my dawg, "We gon' be good, my nigga, trust me" (Hey)
When it's all said and done, she still gon' suck me (Hey)
Money fast, now it come like it rush me, hey
Yeah, but I want a bigger bag, want a bigger crib, hey
Want a bigger chain, hey, want the sickest whip, hey
Want some bigger shit, hey, when I'm bigger bitch, hey
We just nigga rich, hey, bitch, I'm nigga rich
