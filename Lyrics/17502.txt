Lullaby (Calvo Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me
So sing to me
I need you
I need
So sing to me
Just sing to me
[Bridge]
When I'm not sleeping, you're all I need and
Just sing, just sing to me
Can't you please sing to me?

[Chorus]
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me
I need
So sing to me
I need
So sing to meYou might also likeEmbed
