Peanut Butter Waffles Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’m always singing 'bout my fickle feelings 'cause there ain’t no antidote
Laying here in silence 'cause I cannot find the damn remote
Even if I found it, I would probably just flip, flip, and flip
In the midst of August getting started on my Christmas list
I been thinking 'bout you and I wanna go do something nice
I can’t take rejection and that’s why I pay the crazy price
If you ain’t ecstatic, I feel like I blew it big time
I’m a little manic, I just wanna see your big smile
Nothing means more to me than when I hear that you’re proud of me
Acting like a kid because I never quite learned how to be
Peanut butter waffles when it’s dinner time and I’m alone
Hiding in my castle, but the walls are made of styrofoam
[Chorus]
I know
There’s no in-between, it’s either: high, low
You know how to balance, but I don’t
I wish I could finally just find home
I know
There’s no in-between, it’s either: high, low
You know how to balance, but I don’t
I wish I could finally just find home

[Verse 2]
I’m drinking coffee at 3am, playing Battlegrounds and Overwatch
Volume up to 50 'cause it get too trippy if it’s not
I can hear the fridge buzz, I can hear my thoughts clear
I can hear the room ring, I can hear who’s not here
I let my lil' bro talk me into buying designer clothes
He tell me I’m flexing but I don’t even feel kinda close
Them bitches were brand new, but they look like old shoes
Could’ve bought a puppy or 220 cold brews
When somebody ask me how I been, I get too personal
Catching up and small talk are 2 things I never learned to do
I make life decisions in the time it take to brush my teeth
Can’t remember where I been, don’t know where I’m gonna be

[Chorus]
I know
There’s no in-between, it’s either: high, low
You know how to balance, but I don’t
I wish I could finally just find home
I know
There’s no in-between, it’s either: high, low
You know how to balance, but I don’t
I wish I could finally just find home
