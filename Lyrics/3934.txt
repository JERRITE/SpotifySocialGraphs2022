Bottom of the Ocean Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Here, nights are foggy and weird
Everyone I trusted disappears
Breathing life into my deepest fears
Take, now there's nothing to take
Now you're haunted by your worst mistakes
Watch me sinking underneath the waves

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
I don't want to drink about it (Stare it down)
Driving out at 3 am (No way out)
Blood is cold, my mind is clouded (And then I woke up drunken)
How'd I make it here again? (Too much, too much to take)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note, it read

[Post-Chorus: Matt Skiba and Simon Wilcox]
"If you need me, I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me, I'll be right here"

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus + Matt Skiba]
Air, leave it up in the air
Because the people on the ground don't care
They don't notice but it's everywhere
Chase, now there's nothing to chase
Every day I feel so out of place
Let me wash away without a trace

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus, (Matt Skiba)]
I don't want to drink about it (Stare it down)
Driving out at 3 am (No way out)
Blood is cold, my mind is clouded (And then I woke up drunken)
How'd I make it here again? (Too much, too much to take)

Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note, it read

[Post-Chorus: Matt Skiba and Simon Wilcox]
"If you need me, I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me, I'll be right here"

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus, (Matt Skiba)]
I'm out here in the deep end, I'm lower than I've ever been
(I burn it down, It turns to smoke)
And when I see the morning, it's colder than it's ever been
(My bloodshot eyes see through the smoke)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Days, I've been like this for days
Hiding underneath the darkest waves
I've been praying for the tide to change
Head, is this all in my head?
Running over every word I said
When they finally found my note, it read
[Post-Chorus: Matt Skiba and Simon Wilcox]
"If you need me, I'll be lying here at the bottom of the ocean
If you need me, I'll be right here"1Embed
