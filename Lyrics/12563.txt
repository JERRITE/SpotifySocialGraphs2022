Over & Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was a company event
With a margarita tent
I said, "how's your week?"
She said, "man I'm spent"
And I could use a crazy night
And I would love to see Chennai
We could commandeer a little plane and fly
Or we could just skip stones in the shade

[Chorus]
I wanna call you mine, and never let you down
I wanna feel it's right, over and over
I wanna get inside, and take it up and down
I wanna live this night over and over
[Verse 2]
She had her finger on the braille, we let the thimble go to jail
A little wooden sign that said, "brace yourself"

[Chorus]
I wanna call you mine, and never let you down
I wanna feel it's right, over and over
I wanna get inside, and take it up and down
I wanna live this night over and over

[Bridge]
And if we have to flee the city, from the parlor to the well
All we'll have to show for leaving, is a penny soaked to hell
And if we have to flee the city, from the parlor to the well
All we'll have to show for leaving, is a penny soaked to hell

[Chorus]
I wanna call you mine, and never let you down
I wanna feel it's right, over and over
I wanna get inside, and take it up and down
I wanna live this night over and over
I wanna call you mine, and never let you down
I wanna feel it's right, over and over
I wanna get inside, and take it up and down
I wanna live this night over and overYou might also like6Embed
