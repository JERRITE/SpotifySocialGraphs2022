â€‹touch tank Lyrics[Intro]
Canceled a hot hipster threesome for you
'Cause I preach of freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse
Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool
And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos

[Chorus]
'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me
[Verse]
It's such a short drive to get to the touch tank
To you, deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (Manta ray)
Tender two fingers to touch the display
I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face

[Chorus]
He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

[Bridge]
You took my breath away
So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore
We're too old to live with our parents
Do you wanna wake up to me every morning?
Every morning
Every morning
I'm swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean in a parachute
I am swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean

[Chorus]
He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with meYou might also like2Embed
