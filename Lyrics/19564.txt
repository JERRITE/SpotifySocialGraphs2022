My Phone Died Lyrics[Chorus]
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that I'm on
Already, yeah
Already sick of this song
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that i'm on
I prolly, yeah
I prolly end up alone

My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad, my bad, my bad
[Verse]
Knock knock
Who's there
Police department, the new sheriff
We need to talk to you about
Where you were at midnight
Would you care to share
I'm sorry to bother you
It's awfully rude
We just wanna to talk to you
Did you happen to watch the news?
The divorced dad killer’s back on the loose
At the crime scene left lots of clues
Dropped his tools
Lost both socks and shoes
Somebody saw the dude and said
He looked like a methed out prostitute
Sorry y'all
I’m not the guy
Can't talk right now not tonight
Good luck solving crime but I swear to you
Nobody’s tied up, locked inside
Of my 13 bathroom 10 bed mansion
Backyard with a tool shed expansion
Half Ted Bundy, half Ted Danson
Somehow ugly and drop dead handsome
It's hard to explain
Even to a Princeton, Harvard brain
Either end up in the Hall of Fame or down in a ball of flames
You might also like[Chorus]
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that I'm on
Already, yeah
Already sick of this song
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that i'm on
I prolly, yeah
I prolly end up alone

My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad, my bad, my bad

[Verse 2]
Relax, deep breath
Step back, heat check
Broke boy, defect
Big mushroom hit reset
Y'all couldn't take my style if you took my chain
And you had my presets
Flying with a sack in the backpack I forgot I had that
It's a good thing I got pre-check huh
Sitting up front with the seat back
You don’t want smoke, no e-cig huh
I get a call head over in a red Rover
Like I'm on recess huh
If you can't keep that dirty little secret
I might block that bitch like a reject
If my exes send me texts
That shit bounce back like a reflex
Oh wow
Up until now that ain't occur to me
Giving a smile and wave to security
I'm still a child, I blame immaturity
Currently I don't got time to play with them
I'm in a state of emergency
I severed a vein in surgery
Turned all the furniture burgundy
Now it's a murder scene
[Chorus]
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that I'm on
Already, yeah
Already sick of this song
Can’t even pick up the phone
All of the shit that i'm on
I prolly, yeah
I prolly end up alone

My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad my phone died, died, died
My bad, my bad, my badEmbed
