Bang My Line Lyrics[Intro: Cosmo's Midnight]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, bang my line, baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh

[Verse 1: Cosmo's Midnight]
Started as a friend
Can't seem to make a move
Don't know what to send to you
I was waiting for a feeling, I won't ever even show
And you could be misleading, and you'd never even know, oh
[Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to

[Post-Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, bang my line, baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, take your time, but don't forget to

[Verse 2: Tkay Maidza & Both]
Yuh, not really thinking 'bout the future and the repercussions
Where the topic is to ride it out without any discussion
Crazy, now you see the balance fall, I keep it very sweet
Twenty feet above the street
Windows down and cherry seats
Denim pants and dirty tees
Never been the one that's tried to take it slow, oh, yeah
You could be misleading and you'd never even know, oh

[Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to

[Post-Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, bang my line, baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, take your time, but don't forget to (Bang my line)

You know I been waiting for it
Hit the line and bring the foreign
Make sure all the seats imported (Bang my line)
Read receipts, it ain't important
If the energy's in orbit
Get the dunk, I'm speaking Jordans (Bang my line)
It ain't a map of the numbers behind us
You know, yeah, you know, yeah, you know
Where it goes

[Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to
Bang my line, take your time, but don't forget to

[Post-Chorus: Cosmo's Midnight]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, bang my line, baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh, take your time, but don't forget toEmbed
