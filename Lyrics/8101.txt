Call Me a Spaceman Lyrics[Verse]
Through the Milky Way in my spaceship
At the speed of light, I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me
Turn on the cameras take another scene
We go like hands up people get with the show
We're taking over people lose control
And that's my DJ reaching my soul
Aim for the stars my people, we never fall

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe
Yes, I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe
[Pre-Drop]
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman, call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman, man-man-man, man, man

[Drop: Instrumental]
Call me a spaceman

[Verse]
Through the Milky Way in my spaceship
At the speed of light, I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me
Turn on the cameras take another scene
We go like hands up people get with the show
We're taking over people lose control
And that's my DJ reaching my soul
Aim for the stars my people, we never fall

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe
Yes, I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe

[Pre-Drop]
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman, call me a spaceman
Call me a spaceman, man-man-man, man, man, man, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
