TranslationsTürkçeIf You Leave Me Now Lyrics[Intro: Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men]
Oh, whoa, oh
Oh-oh-oh, whoa
Ahh, ahh, ooh

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry, woah
It doesn't have to end this way
[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

[Chorus: Charlie Puth with Boyz II Men]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
(AH) You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now (Ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Wanyá Morris]
When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unravellin'
And girl, it's drivin' me insane
There's no road worth travellin'

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men]
When I think about all of the nights you're gone
(Nights you're gone, oh)
I get terrified (I get terrified)
Please don't say goodbye (Bye)

[Chorus: Wanyá Morris with Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out (Oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now, oh

Baby, if you leave me

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanyá Morris]
Baby, if you leave me now (Leave me now)
Oh, if you give it up and just walk right out (Hey)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now

[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wanyá Morris, Both]
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
