Acapella Lyrics[Intro: Amy Noonan]
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover (Lover)
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another (-nother)
Now you're talking crazy, saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella (-rella)
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
I’ma do it acapella, yeah
I’ma do it acapella, yeah
[Verse 1: Amy Noonan]
Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said, "Get a rich boyfriend
You don’t gotta love ‘em, girl, you can pretend"
You bet I totes believed her, yeah, every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread
Mama always said, "Nice guys finish last
Beat ‘em at his own game, honey, take the cash"

[Pre-Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Ooh, and what a lucky girl you will be
But no, he didn’t do jack for me
I want a bean with a beanstalk
And if the magic ain’t right, time to walk

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover (Lover)
All the harmony went falling out of key
So now you gotta find another, yeah
Now you’re talking crazy, saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella (-rella)
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
I’ma do it acapella, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I’ma do it acapella, yeah

[Verse 2: Amy Noonan, Nick Noonan, Both]
Out on our first date, he took me gourmet
We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy
Daddy always said, "Let the gentleman pay
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet”
I saw his bad intention, he didn’t wanna talk
He put the saucy on it (Oops!), time to check my watch
Daddy always said, ”Money can’t buy class
You don’t wanna get stuck taking out trash”

[Pre-Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Ooh, and yeah, I guess it wasn’t meant to be
Because he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with a beanstalk
And if the magic ain’t right, time to walk

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover (Lover)
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another, yeah
Now you’re talking crazy, saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella (-rella)
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
I’ma do it acapella, yeah

[Bridge: Amy Noonan]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me do it in falsetto
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh - nevermind, bring the beat back (Baby)

[Chorus: Amy Noonan]
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady (Hey)
Thought you were the perfect lover (Lover)
All the harmony went falling out of key
So now you gotta find another (Ooh, now you gotta find another)
Now you’re talking crazy, saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella (Hey)
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
I’ma do it acapella, yeah

[Outro: Amy Noonan]
