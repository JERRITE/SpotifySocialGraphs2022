Tonight Is The Night I Die Lyrics[Intro]
Tonight is the night I die

[Verse 1]
Lonely, another day
Drowning, please save me
I am struggling in my own daydream

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can't live much longer
Hear the angels sing
[Chorus]
Tonight is the night I die
Tonight is the night I die
Tonight is the night I

[Verse 2]
Surrender to my pain, locked inside my cage
Could I be a prisoner for the voices in my brain?
My mind is gone to waste, can't stand to look at my face
All these thoughts inside my head, be silenced by the bang

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can't live much longer
Hear the angels sing

[Chorus]
Tonight is the night I die
(Believe me, believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die
(Believe me, believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die

[Post-Chorus]
Die another day
What they want me to say
What they want me to say
Die another day
Die another day
Die another day
Tonight is the night I die

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I look at you as I take my last breath
As I die and fall to the floor
My pain and suffering is no more

[Chorus]
Tonight is the night I die
(Believe me, believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die
(Believe me, believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die

[Post-Chorus]
Die another day
What they want me to say
What they want me to say
Die another day
Die another day
Die another day
Tonight is the night I die
Tonight is the night I die2Embed
