F.ck Me Eyes LyricsWoke up another day being a vibe, I
Can’t say that I’m surprised
And no I’m not high
I just kinda got those
F.ck me eye, eyes

Abundant with the magic
I overflow
I’m not for you if
Supernatural
Make you uncomfortable
‘Cause I overflow
Feel free to feel free with me
I know we’re fed so many misleading ideas
‘Bout how this should be
But you should feel free to feel free with me

Woke up another day being a vibe
I can’t say that I’m surprised
And No I’m not high
I just kinda got those
Fuck me eyes
Eye-eye- eyes

Love when you lеt your music play
Unconventional taste
Nothing that I’ve hеard
And your words ring the same way
So original, vibe so pure
Even when its chaos you my peace, you a cure
I just canceled my session
Usually, work is first
But you and I are Art
A movie, must-observe
And I’m a masterpiece
Let you learn every curve
Hit you with the jokes
Yeah that’s just the way I flirt

Can’t say that I’m surprised
And no I’m not high
I just kinda got those
Fuck me eyes
Eye-eye- eyes

Woke up another day being a vibe
I Can’t say that I’m surprised
And no I’m not high
I just kinda got those
Fuck me eyes
Eye-eye- eyes


(Abundant with the magic, I overflow
No I’m not high - but I might get high, high, high)
