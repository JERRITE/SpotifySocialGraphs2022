No Exit Lyrics[Verse 1]
It gets hard tryna see through all this revenue, baby
If you had it all, what would you do with it?
You know I gotta tight grip on you (Woah, woah, woah)
I ain't ever losin' you (No, no)
'Cause you've been down for a long time
There's no other love that I'm gon' find

[Pre-Chorus]
(For you, for you) Yeah
So let me make this clear, my love
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere
It really ain't no exit (Oh), no, nah
It really ain't no exit for me (Oh, nah)
I ain't worried 'bout the next chick, no, no
There really ain't no exit for me
[Chorus]
'Cause I leave with you out the club (You know, you know)
Bad girls just don't do enough (You know, you know)
Take it all, you got my love (Ooh)
I promise, girl, you got my love (You know, you know)
Damn, there really ain't no exit (Oh)
There really ain't no exit for me (Oh)
I ain't lookin' for no exit (Oh)
There really ain't no exit for me

[Verse 2]
So don't be worried 'bout my ex-chick (No)
I know that you heard them stories
'Bout all them games we used to play
But that ain't me now, I'm different, babe
All around the world in one day
So many different girls be on me
You know them bright lights be on me
But you're the one for me, let's be honest

[Pre-Chorus]
(For you, for you) Yeah
So let me make this clear, my love (Nowhere)
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere
It really ain't no exit (No), no, nah
It really ain't no exit for me
I ain't worried 'bout the next chick, no, no
There really ain't no exit for me

'Cause I leave with you out the club (You know, you know)
Bad girls just don't do enough (You know, you know)
Take it all, you got my love

Damn, there really ain't no exit (Huh)
There really ain't no exit for me
I ain't lookin' for no exit (Oh)
There really ain't no exit for me (Ow!)

[Bridge]
If you ride, I'ma ride with you (Yeah)
I don't wanna go nowhere
I don't wanna go, no
I'ma make it up, baby, now
I'ma make it up to you now
Make it up, baby
Woah-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I leave with you out the club (You know, you know)
Bad girls just don't do enough (You know, you know, no)
Take it all, you got my love (You got it, oh)
I promise, girl, you got my love (You know, you know)
Damn, there really ain't no exit (No, no exit)
There really ain't no exit for me
