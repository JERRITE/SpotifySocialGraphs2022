Space Oddity (Clareville Grove Demo) [2019 Remaster] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight)
(Seven, six) Commencing (Five) countdown
Engines on (Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One)
And may God's love (Blast off) be with you
[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you
You might also like[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can doEmbed
