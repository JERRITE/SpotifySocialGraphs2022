Reasons to Stay Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been driving around here in this town
Know it like the back of my hand
I've been dreaming of ways, ways to get out
Put myself in a box that I'd never be
Someone I'm proud of you see
Here I am on this bridge facing defeat

[Chorus]
I'm just doing the best I can
I'm just living the life I have
I'm confused but I'm fine with that
The beauty will outweigh the pain
From the chill of the autumn wind
And the laugh of your sister's kid
To the first snow when it sets in
The beauty will outweigh the pain
We'll all find a purpose one day
There's so many reasons to stay
[Verse 2]
No I don't wanna die, just don't wanna live
Why can't I reach out for help
You would do anything to get me through this
I'm so used to alone, don't know what it's like
To let someone into my mind
But I'd do anything just to survive

[Chorus]
I'm just doing the best I can
I'm just living the life I have
I'm confused but I'm fine with that
The beauty will outweigh the pain
From the chill of the autumn wind
And the laugh of your sister's kid
To the first snow when it sets in
The beauty will outweigh the pain
We'll all find a purpose one day
There's so many reasons to stay

[Outro]
I'm just doing the best I can
I'm just living the life I have
I'm confused but I'm fine with that
The beauty will outweigh the pain
We'll all find a purpose one day
We all have a reason to stayYou might also likeEmbed
