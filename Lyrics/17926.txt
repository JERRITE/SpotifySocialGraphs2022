Paraiso Lyrics[Verse 1]
Return to a land called Paraiso
A place where a dying river ends
No birds dare fly over Paraiso
No space allows them to endure
The smoke that screens the air
The grass that's never there

[Refrain 1]
And if I could see a single bird
What a joy!
I try to write some words and create
A simple song to be heard
By the rest of the world
[Verse 2]
I live in this land called Paraiso
In a house made of cardboard floors and walls
I learned to be free in Paraiso
Free to claim anything I see
Matching rags for my clothes
Plastic bags for the colds

[Refrain 2]
And if empty cans were all I have
What a joy!
I never fight to take someone else's coins
And live with fear like the rest of the boys

[Chorus]
Paraiso, help me make a stand
Paraiso, take me by the hand
Paraiso, make the world understand

[Refrain 3]
That if I could see a single bird
What a joy!
This tired and hungry land could expect
Some truth and hope and respect
From the rest of the world
You might also like[Interlude]

[Refrain 2]
And if empty cans were all I have
What a joy!
I never fight to take someone else's coins
And live with fear like the rest of the boys

[Chorus]
Paraiso, help me make a stand
Paraiso, take me by the hand
Paraiso, make the world understand

[Refrain 3]
That if I could see a single bird
What a joy!
This tired and hungry land could expect
Some truth and hope and respect
From the rest of the world

[Chorus]
Paraiso, help me make a stand
Paraiso, take me by the hand
Paraiso, make the world understand

[Refrain 3]
That if I could see a single bird
What a joy!
This tired and hungry land could expect
Some truth and hope and respect
From the rest
[Outro]
That if I could see a single bird
What a joy!
This tired and hungry land could expect
Some truth and hope and respect
From the rest of the worldEmbed
