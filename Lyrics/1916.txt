MUTUAL FRIEND Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I'm in therapy, shut up, I know
"Ain't she so crazy?" I know, bitch

[Verse 1]
Our mutual friend said you'd been callin'
And said that you're sorry and said that you wish we could talk
Well, guess what? You're about seven months late
Our mutual friend don't know that you're too self-serving
But I do and that's why your words don't mean shit
And guess what? This heartbreak morphed into hate
[Pre-Chorus]
And you should be grateful that I didn't hurt you back

[Chorus]
If you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is
And if you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is

[Verse 2]
Our mutual friend had front row tickets to all our events
Every time that you played all your games
Well, guess what? I got nеw hobbies these days
And nеver again will I let you turn me back into a mess
That girl's been on a carton of milk
And guess what? Your karma's that you love me still

[Pre-Chorus]
And you should be grateful that I didn't hurt you back

[Chorus]
But if you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is
And if you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is

Yeah, our mutual friend
Asked me how I sleep with so much hate in my heart
I told them I sleep like a baby
Told them I sleep like a baby, yeah

[Chorus]
If you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is, yeah, yeah
And if you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is, yeah, yeah
And if you died tomorrow, I don't think I'd cry
I gave you one too many nights
Don't care if it sound cold, it is what it is1Embed
