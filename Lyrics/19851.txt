Telling Me Yes Lyrics[Chorus: AKA]
I don't wanna beef, I don't wanna contact
I don't want static, I don't want stress
2, 4, 6, that's simple math
Give her, her freedom, Uber Black
When your bottle is gone
(When your bottle is gone)
Your mami is telling me "Yes" (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 1: AKA]
(Yo!)
I couldn't even breathe when I pulled up in the parking
Everybody was on me, mamis lookin' like zombies
760 was creepin', please don't touch my belongings
Homie don't run up on me, askin' when we recordin'
Take the elevator to the kitchen
I'm so anti-social, keep your distance (Huh)
I done crossed off fifty bad bitch on my hitlist
'Cause I'm the realest nigga in existence
I swear on my life and the Lord is my witness
Flows over hoes, I'm the best in the business
Can't lose my control, I'm tryna be a good Christian
But I'm rockin' Dior, and Twitter is crucifixion (Woo!)
This a shot to your system, shot for your sister
Every ten bucks make me richer
Add it all up, now we all drunk
Who are you to judge my position?
I look in the mirror...
[Chorus: AKA]
I don't wanna beef, I don't wanna contact
I don't want static, I don't want stress
2, 4, 6, that's simple math
Give her, her freedom, Uber Black
When your bottle is gone
(When your bottle is gone)
Your mami is telling me "Yes" (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 2: L-Tido]
(Look, ayy)
As we continue with the saga
It's 16V bitch, did I s-s-s-stutter? (Huh?)
May compare to lames, that an easy bet
It's like a BMX tryna verse a CLS
You pull up on a thot, they denied request
I pull up on a thot, then it's Y-E-S (Yes!)
I'm from surrounding sec, cause some kinda deep stress
But still livin like some nigga with no regrets
Struggle is temporary, hustle is necessary
Don't talk to me 'bout beef unless it's culinary
Gomora's Eazy-E
She see the G in me
My heart colder than beach water in CPT
My nigga, you're a nasty dude
Me I'm stackin' tall racks like Nasty do
I'm from the bottom, where were you when I was reachin' out?
Could never walk in my shoes, these kicks ain't even out
You might also like[Chorus: AKA]
I don't wanna beef, I don't wanna contact
I don't want static, I don't want stress
2, 4, 6, that's simple math
Give her, her freedom, Uber Black
When your bottle is gone
(When your bottle is gone)
Your mami is telling me "Yes" (Oh oh oh)1Embed
