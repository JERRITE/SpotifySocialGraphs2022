Mr Sandman Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Yo! (yo)
Yo, can you put something else on while you're loading that beat so I can spit a little freestyle? (yeah) (K)

[Verse]
Yeah, they wanted to go shop for shot, now they're looking at the ref like please can you stop the clock?
I think that he's cheating or he's reading of the teleprompt
Whatever you need to believe in then you can tell him dog. (dog)(dog)
Like I fabricated my raps, they just aggravated that won't ejaculate in the ass, they just havеn't made it so now they have to blamе it on Mac. (He's to animated and all his animations are wack, Waaaow)
(You woke the beast up late)
You got a little chip on you like when the teacup breaks
Stanton made me Beats by Dre, to speak my brain
Used to work at pizza place to meat my fate, thanks
(Hey)
Now it's season 8, wait. (wait) (wait)
I meant season 7 (yeah). Leave that there, no need to edit. (no)
Piece that rare, don't need the credit. (nah)
(Easy)
Stumble through the door (door), kill so many people I'm in trouble with the lord
Leave them at the morgue , in a puddle on the floor
Used to do it low-key, I'm not subtle anymore, no
Smoking crack (crack), high, drinking mocha fraps
The dopest spoken rap is mine, I need Doja Cat
So she can take her top off like a soda cat
Top me off, up, down, rollercoaster tracks. (Weee)
This is for my amusement, ignore the excuses they making man, they borderline stupid, they reporting the music I'm making and hoarding the losing, then recording delusional verses they think it's improvements. (So why they pissed now!?)
Because the list where I cross names, I'm getting rich, rich rich, on the blockchain
If I walk then I stop, there's a soft stain. People looking at me like, he's got that octane
No, I'm not playing, You're a guest in the game no you're not staying. (Go away)
Go Away, get the fuck awayYou might also likeEmbed
