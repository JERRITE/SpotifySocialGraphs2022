[Chorus: K-Trap]
Hate when it's fizzy, I'd rather discreet (Quiet)
Little man wanna know if he hits someone with the pole, can he take it home? (Baow)
Playin' for keeps (Huh)
You play in the streets I tell him, "Don't do it", I promise you'll lay in the streets (Lay there)
If I got your whore on my phone then leave her alone, I promise she's layin' with me (Yes)
Bro got the ten and the twenty stack on the floor, that's a MAC with extra cheese (Grrt, bap)
Bro let it (Bap, bap, bap), I swеar he's got an extra sleeve (Huh)
I hatе when it—, needs extra grease (Argh)
Try get one on the way back home (Mm), made an extra scene (Mm)
[Verse 1: K-Trap]
I'm at aunties, smellin' like open bine (Yuck), hope she don't preach
Run up on me, I'll open fire (Baow), don't try it on me (No)
Bro came wearin' the G17 (Glee), Let me try it on me (Glee)
Get the drop and he's comin' home, Yardman ting, I'll bleach (I'll bleach it)
Twelve in this ugly betty, it's live and in reach (I got it)
This one a competitor with this glee, it's holdin' fifteen (Huh)
I can sport this Day-Date, calm, I filled Lambeth with arms (Grrt)
Party with the star, I'm savin' the last dance (Ha)
Came a long way from a cricket bat (Hooh, huh)
Now the whoosh holds thirty shots, that button on the side, gotta flick it back (Grrt, bap)
S-A-D means sad, that's gang, gonna do you bad
Bro tryna work the skrrt-skrrt, hold it and drag it back (Skrrt-skrrt)
Hundred bine for the summer, I bet Peewee's gonna say, "We need more" (Huh)
Made me a killin' off dummy bricks, had them screamin', "Need raw"
If they knew what we had in store
Remember when man done **** in store
Top floor views with a bag of whores
I ain't gotta brag no more (No)

[Chorus: K-Trap & Headie One]
Hate when it's fizzy, I'd rather discreet (Quiet)
Little man wanna know if he hits someone with the pole, can he take it home? (Baow)
Playin' for keeps (Huh)
You play in the streets I tell him, "Don't do it", I promise you'll lay in the streets (Lay there)
If I got your whore on my phone then leave her alone, I promise she's layin' with me (Yes)
Bro got the ten and the twenty stack on the floor, that's a MAC with extra cheese (Grrt, bap)
Bro let it (Bap, bap, bap), I swear he's got an extra sleeve (Huh)
I hate when it—, needs extra grease (Argh)
Try get one on the way back home (Mm), made an extra scene (Mm, One)

They thought they would get it back in blood (Tsh)
They was dissin' on gang, so instead they got their boy back in dust, (Mad ting, sad ting)
Bro let it (Bap, bap, bap), forensics had to get him out the mud (Argh)
We were old friends, is it out of hate or out of love? (Told me turn)
Yeah, I'm at Wireless wearin' in ears (Told me turn)
That I've been over there, I've been there
I see bro slappin' man's chest, Ric Flair
My young boys left that swimmin'
Forgot to tell them, "Bring swimwear"
Why fist fight when I Binance lives?
I ain't gotta put on no resident gear
We don't beef he was sittin' it out (No)
His BM, I was dickin' that down (Argh)
She told me you don't check for the yute, but you still wan' rap about a million pounds (Fool)
It's two G17s for the head back
The black blade doin' jet black
Shaved that (Shh), left him with a wet back
And he still ain't get no get back

[Chorus: K-Trap]
Hate when it's fizzy, I'd rather discreet
Little man wanna know if he hits someone with the pole, can he take it home? (Baow)
Playin' for keeps (Huh)
You play in the streets I tell him, "Don't do it", I promise you'll lay in the streets (Lay there)
If I got your whore on my phone then leave her alone, I promise she's layin' with me (Yes)
Bro got the ten and the twenty stack on the floor, that's a MAC with extra cheese (Grrt, bap)
Bro let it (Bap, bap, bap), I swear he's got an extra sleeve (Huh)
I hate when it—, needs extra grease (Argh)
Try get one on the way back home (Mm), made an extra scene
