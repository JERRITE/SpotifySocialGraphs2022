I Wanna Be There LyricsI wanna be there when you arrive
I wanna see her, I'll shred her eyes
I wanna be here when you defy
I wanna see it with my own eyes

And if you want to leave me fraying
I don't know what I'd do with myself
On the day I see you coming
I don't know what I'll do with myself

I don't like your sense of fun
I'll be laughing, I'll watch you run
I don't like your sense of fun
I'll be laughing, I'll watch you run, run, run
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
Oh, I wanna be there
I wanna be there
Oh, I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I'm gonna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I'm gonna be there
Be there
I'm gonna be thereYou might also likeEmbed
