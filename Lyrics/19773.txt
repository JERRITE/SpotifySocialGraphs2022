Snowflakes Lyrics[Chorus]
Now that I'm back on the road
You're in your bed all alone
It's alright, I'm doing okay
And in my mind, you're in the doorway
Now that I'm back in my zone
I smoke 'til my seams come unsewn
You could not take this away from me
You could not take this away from me
Work so damn hard on my own
Sit in my bedroom alone
I did this shit all in one take
You could not touch what I'm on, mate
Steady your breathing, it's cold
And your eyes are made out of coal
Crying but your tears are snowflakes
And this car that's coming got no brakes, no brakes
[Verse]
I've been livin' my life to the fullest
Anxiety comes but it won't sit
Got tossed in the bag but it won't zip
'Cause I killed my mind all in one hit
Blast to the past and I feel it
The days we put stars on our ceilings
The tape on my heart's always peeling
And I do not find that appealing
So maybe I contemplate, strategize ways to ease my mind
Sit awake and I bake all through the night
Touch base with your face being close to mine
And maybe you can't sleep 'cause your dreams never seem to soothe
So you spark in the dark tryna make your move
Touch me and I fall but I play it cool

[Bridge]
Lost in your embrace and I'm longing for your taste love
Said we'd run away but you hardly ever say much

[Chorus]
Now that I'm back on the road
You're in your bed all alone
It's alright, I'm doing okay
And in my mind, you're in the doorway
Now that I'm back in my zone
I smoke 'til my seams come unsewn
You could not take this away from me
You could not take this away from me
Work so damn hard on my own
Sit in my bedroom alone
I did this shit all in one take
You could not touch what I'm on, mate
Steady your breathing, it's cold
And your eyes are made out of coal
Crying but your tears are snowflakes
And this car that's coming got no brakes, no brakes

(You can't, you can't, take this, take this)
Steady your breathing, it's...
(Away, away, away, away, away)
Steady your breathing, it's cold
(You can't, you can't, take this, take this)
Crying but your tears are snowflakes
(Away, away, away, away, yeah)
And this car that's coming got no brakes, no breaks11Embed
