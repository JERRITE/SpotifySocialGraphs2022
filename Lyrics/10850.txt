Into The Sea LyricsAnd it's all right, it's all right
And it's all right, it's all right
Everybody is a failure in this light
And it's okay, it's okay
And it's okay, it's okay
Underneath it nobody's back is straight
I tried to stop it when
I saw your posture start to bend
But honey it was not mine to lift

Go throw yourself into the sea
And it's all right, it's all right
And it's all right, I can't make it right
Somebody put a bad lens in your eye
You try to shed your skin when you saw yourself in it so thin
But you only shed your blood
When you climb out you can't climb back in

Go throw yourself into the sea (x2)
Though we don't need a mountain moved
We just want to move ourselves
Take us somewhere, take us somewhere, anywhere else

Go throw yourself into the sea
It's all right, it's all right
Though we don't ever see you move
Slowly the wind turns you to sand
In the hands of children on the shoreYou might also likeEmbed
