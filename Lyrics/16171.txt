I Burned LA Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
You left a hole in my chest when you left
And my heart followed you out the door
And I stood and bled in the hall, watched it all
And the mess that it left on the floor
If I gave you less, would you want me more?
And you could've said anything at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter, broken heart
[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there

[Verse 2]
I waste my brеath on a prayer, you don't care
I was nevеr a part of your plan
You can't make a God of somebody
Who's not even half of a half-decent man

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter, broken heart

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there
I burned this city down 'cause you didn't care, no, you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there

You left a hole in my chest when you left
And my heart followed you out the door3Embed
