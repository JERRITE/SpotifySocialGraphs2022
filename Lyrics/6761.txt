Flash Bang Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, huh, yeah
Alright, hold up, hold up, hold up
There's like a droning noise coming out the headphones, man
Oh, that's the beat? That's the actual beat? Pfft
(Is this guy actually gonna rap on this?)
Alright man, shit, I had no idea
(He's gonna rap on this droning noise?)
Uh, huh, yeah, lemme try this
Uh, yeah yeah, okay, uh, yeah
Overkill
Oh my god, now this thing is gonna be talking over my adlibs
Killtacular
Killtrocity
Really?
Killimanjaro

[Verse]
Kill you where you standing, I don't think you understand it
I can't stand you, not gonna take that sittin' down? Okay, I'll slam ’em
Body drop like drowning pool, he 17, boy, stay in school
Ain't gon' make me lose my cool, that fan gon' blow right out the blue
I see you, when I see you, like a movie trailer preview, huh
But he ain't coming back so don't be waiting for that sequel
Your bones is gettin' broken like that ex that made you single
I reverse your hype entirely and see you in my rear view
I don't care bout if this feed you, watch me blade the key like Riku
I'm soaring past you goofies while you Donald Duck for cover
Call your people, get your brother, I'm aiming at yo' mother
If he think he slick as butter, can't believe it, grabbed your cousin
While they dreaming under covers, annihilate your lover
I shoot a jumper out the courthouse, still gonna beat the buzzer
They never should of let me out, the cage I been in lying down
Exposing all you liars now for what you really are deep down
Could've been this way before but chose to be this way right now
Could've been on top before but too lazy to go and take trash out
Yeah, 1k, keep that shit 1k, ball hard like 2K
Get yo' face, out my space, erase, everything you make
Real quick, huh, black hole yo' shit, uh-huh
Attract yo' bitch, she pull close get sucked in, uh-huh
Damn that Twit pic, uh-huh, she follow dick, uh-huh
Slip in slide her DM, slip inside her, she get wet, uh-huh
Fukkit so tech, give me lines like he sell tech
Or shoot back like TEC-9, divide by three right at ya neck
There's words left unsaid, need a censor like its triple x
I triple up yo' debt, now he doubting if he better dead
I put his ass to bed, like lil' baby while he wah-wah 'cause clearly you upset
Like you verified, I send a check that's pointed at yo chest
What you want with me? Nigga, what you want with me?
This a Kodak moment cause we in here smoking broccoli

[Hook]
Flashbang, white screen, no field of vision
Can't see what you can't hear in the distance
Concussed, your head bust
I scope you like it's 1v1 on Rust
I keep that thang tucked
It's Fukkit, cannot let you up
Flashbang, white screen, no field of vision
Can't see what you can't hear in the distance
Concussed, your head bust
I scope you like it's 1v1 on Rust
I keep that thang tucked
It's Fukkit, cannot let you up

[Outro]
