[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, ayy, man, listen

[Verse 1]
Soulo hold a prophecy, I got a premonition (Yeah)
I'ma let the beat build and do some demolition (Yeah)
Interrupt your whole style, this an inhibition
Kamikaze everybody, Eminem edition
[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
This the, this the flavor in your ear, and it's brand new (Uh)
Craig Mack been back, bitch, where you? (Where you?)
Started from the bottom like a square root (Yeah)
Then we kept it in the family like an heirloom (Squad)
Wagyu, medium, I'm in rare form
She hit the split, landed on the dick like Air Jordan

[Interlude]
Will he raise up? I got to know (Yeah)
Uh

[Verse 3]
Nat Turner with the curly hair (Yeah)
Pullin' strings like John Mayer (Uh-huh)
Probably make a bitch wish come true out the blue (Yeah)
Rub the oil lamp and I'm there, yeah
Monkey see, monkey do, my nigga, ask Abu (Huh?)
I'm on a magic carpet stompin' down Central Avenue (Yeah)
Del Amo Boulevard was all I knew
I sold my dream to Punch and Dude, they turned me to the fuckin' truth (Facts)

And the flow is alpaca (Rare)

'Bout it 'bout it, baby, illest nigga in Nebraska
Outlaw breakin' all the rules (Huh)
Pac ashes in the spliff, I'm un-topable

[Outro]
(Will he raise up? I got to know)
That's all I got for you
Yeah, uh

[Part II]

[Intro]
Yo

[Verse]
Another moment of most dopeness for Malcolm McCormick
On the prowl for another style that I stick a fork in
The steak was eighty an ounce, my elbows on the table
I got manners, but breakin' the rules is what we came to do
My lady built like she belong in a stable, I'm on my high horse
They call me Soulo, the irony is to die for
(This ain't a movie, dawg), this bag ain't full of no popcorn
You ain't up to par with me, nor are we on the golf course
Hidden gem like a YMCA in the boondocks
The weapon shop could not keep secret for too long
I'm Dangeroo Kipawaa, refrain from gettin' involved
Or your safety's at stake for sure like a surf and turf you enjoy
Raw backwards on all of you rappers, you heard it before
The rawest rapper of the planet's name is Herbert IV
Sex, drugs, money, and mayhem, the workers of Satan
Still take 'em to church and say, "Amen," my words in a playpen
Ridiculous, the sickest with it, you just a common cold
So novice, I'm the post office pushin' the envelope
Moosa had to remind me who the god was
I ain't on my knees, but I'm praying on him regardless
Matt need a new crib for his baby
So big, he be forgettin' where the crib for his baby
Dot told me, "This time, we demandin' respect"
Milk the game for all it's worth like a mammary gland, ayy
[Outro]
Man
Yeah
Wait for it, wait for it
