Wide Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, some evil spirit, oh, some evil this way comes
They told me how they fear it, now they're placing it on their tongues

[Chorus]
Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyes

[Verse 2]
No food or water for the better part of ten months
Quietly he sat between the folds of a tree trunk
[Chorus]
Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyes

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All the men of faith and men of science had their questions
Could it ever be on earth as it is in heaven?

[Chorus]
Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyesYou might also like11Embed
