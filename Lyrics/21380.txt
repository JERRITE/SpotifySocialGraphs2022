July Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
There I was on a July morning
Looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun
At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me
And the road of my own

[Chorus]
With the day, came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
[Verse 2]
I was looking for love in the strangest places
There wasn't a stone that I left unturned
Must have tried more than a thousand faces
But not one was aware of the fire that burned

[Chorus]
In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la

[Chorus]
In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La, la, la, la

[Verse 3]
There I was on a July morning
I was looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun
At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me, yeah
And the road of my own
You might also like[Chorus]
With the day, came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-laEmbed
