Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart LyricsDear, when you smile at me
I hear a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me
Started a symphony
Zing went the strings of my heart

Whoa now the breath of spring
Whoa I heard a robin sing
About a nest... apart
All that you seem to be
End up in harmony
Zing went the strings of my heart
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope we'll never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine
A rhapsody divine
Zing went the strings of my heart
Zing went the strings of my heart
Zing zing zing zingYou might also likeEmbed
