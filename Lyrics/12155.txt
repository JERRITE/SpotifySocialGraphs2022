Adrenaline Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remembering what you said
Now I'm laying alone in bed
Trying to wrap up this feeling
Falling apart instead

'Cause baby we hit the top
Sweeter than sugar rocks
Holding onto a moment
Let go, I'm falling off
[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it
Oh
Keep calling me home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

[Verse 2]
Remembering all those nights
With your body straight to the sky
You work me until the morning
Fall asleep half past nine (A.M.)

So crazy in love
Enough was never enough
Tell me our touch ain’t dull now
(Tell me our touch ain’t dull now)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it
Oh
Keep calling me home
You might also like[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

[Bridge]
And I don’t know where the ceiling is anymore
No, I don’t know where the feeling is anymore
No, I don't, don't

[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?
(Can we go back from here?)
Can we go back to adrenaline?
(Can we go back from here?)
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
(Can we go back from here?)
Anymore, ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh
(Can we go back from here?)
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
(Can we go back from here?)
Anymore, ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh
(Can we go back from here?)
'Cause I need to feel, need to feel it
