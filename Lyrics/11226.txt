Along Comes Mary Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

[Chorus 1]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

[Verse 2]
When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

[Chorus 2]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much, when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same

[Verse 3]
And when the morning of the warning's passed the gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across - the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone the songs are left unsung
And hung upon - the scars

[Chorus 3]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes, reflect the lies, and make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch3Embed
