Columbia River LyricsEverybody tries to make me dance but I just want to sit still
And stare right at you with my strongest gaze. It's an innocent youthful thrill
And hold your hand on my front porch swing when the summer night sends a chill
And dream of driving way up north though I know we'll never get our fill

Everybody tries to fall in love but I just keep making friends
When I sort through the stars at night I'm looking for some kind of sign of the end
If the sun won't rise when the morning comes I'll be ready 'cause I don't depend
On those things like philosophy and the sunrise, moon tides, pursuit of happiness

I find that I wish I was home
I find that I wish I was home
Singing songs that I [you] already know
Instead of always writing [singing] my own
And arranging the tones
In this city that reminds me I'm alone
I find that I wish I was yours
I find that I wish I was yours
And belonged to all the birds nesting on the porch
And all the trees along the river gorge
And every windswept metaphor --
All of yours until I am nothing moreYou might also like1Embed
