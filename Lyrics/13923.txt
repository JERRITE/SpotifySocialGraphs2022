Lemon to a Knife Fight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hero to zero, I pick up the bill
The brake lights cast a red light
And the road twists 'round the hill
Lipstick on the backseat, saliva on the dash
I've clawed my way out of here before
But I keep on coming back

[Chorus]
I push and you tend to shove
I give in and you don't give up
I'm not getting out of here this time
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I kick and you like to punch
I'm unhinged and you're undone
I'm not getting out of here alive
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
[Verse 2]
Hero to zero at 60mph
My eyes are getting wider with
Every word you say
Intoxicated, higher than the ISS
I've clawed my way out of here before
But tonight, I'm turning left

[Chorus]
I push and you tend to shove
I give in and you don't give up
I'm not getting out of here this time
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I kick and you like to punch
I'm unhinged and you're undone
I'm not getting out of here alive
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I brought a lemon to a knife fight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I push and you tend to shove
I give in and you don't give up
I'm not getting out of here this time
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I kick and you like to punch
I'm unhinged and you're undone
I'm not getting out of here alive
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I brought a lemon to a knife fight
I brought a lemon to a knife fightYou might also like6Embed
