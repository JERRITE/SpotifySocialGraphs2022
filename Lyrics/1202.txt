Iâ€™m in Love with a Monster Lyrics[Verse 1: Lauren, Dinah]
Oh, he'll buy me a thorn before he'll buy me a rose
Be covered in dirt before I'm covered in gold
He's trying it on, yeah, he's ticking me off
Say what you want but I won't ever be told
'Cause I'm in love with a monster
(Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila, Dinah]
Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind
But without you, boy, I'd be bored all the time
No, I don't really care for the same conversation
Got everything I need and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love with a monster
(Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh)
[Chorus: Lauren & Normani, Ally & Camila, Dinah, Lauren]
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I'm in love with a monster
(Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh)

[Verse 2: Dinah, Normani, Both]
Wrap me in leather before you wrap me in lace
We breaking rules like we changing the game
He's trying it on, and he's ticking me off
Say what you want but I won't ever be told
I'm in love with a monster (With a monster)
(Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ally, Dinah & Ally, Dinah]
My nana told me, I should have better taste
But I'd rather pay to see the look on her face
No, I don't really care for the lame conversation
Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love with a monster (With a monster)
(Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh; Aw!)

[Bridge: Lauren, Camila, Ally]
Sweeter you try, they don't be getting love from it
Ain't worth a dime cause I just don't get enough from it
Leave it to me, don't you see, I don't run from it
The bitter the better (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

[Post-Bridge: Camila & Normani, Camila]
You make me crazy, but I love it (I love it, babe)
