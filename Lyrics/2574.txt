Got To Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't like people telling me just who I am
They don't wanna know, they don't really understand
Too many people tryin' to tell me to be practical
Only think that I am one dimensional

Well, I can feel it, there's a fire raging underneath
Burning through the pages, here I am coming clean
I'm sick of lying to myself, gotta live the truth
And now I've got to do what I've gotta do
[Chorus]
This is where I should be
There ain't no other place, yeah
Where my soul really speaks
There ain't no other way

I can feel it save me, move me, chain me
Gotta go where the music takes me
Let it set me free
You got to believe

[Verse 2]
Is it a crime to just be who I wanna be?
I need some space so that I can chase all my dreams
'Cause when I hit the stage, anything is possible
I get lost in the song, and that is magical

So crank it up, feel the rush, then just turn me loose
I wanna build the inspiration that is coming through
And there's a wilder place where I feel so alive
When I start to sing, you just can't deny

[Chorus]
This is where I should be
There ain't no other place, yeah
Where my soul really speaks
There ain't no other way
You might also likeI can feel it save me, move me, chain me
Gotta go where the music takes me
Let it set me free
You got to believe

[Bridge]
When everybody's gone and I'm here all alone
(I don't gotta hide, I don't gotta try)
You got to understand that this is who I am
And it's where I shine
And it's where it's I shine

[Chorus]
I know this is where I should be
There ain't no other place, yeah
Where my soul really speaks
There ain't no other way

I can feel it save me, move me, chain me
Gotta go where the music takes me
Let it set me free
You got to believe

[Chorus]
This is where I should be
There ain't no other place, yeah
Where my soul really speaks
There ain't no other way
I can feel it move me
Gotta go where the music takes me
Let it set me free
(Let it set me free)
Let it set me free
You got to believeEmbed
