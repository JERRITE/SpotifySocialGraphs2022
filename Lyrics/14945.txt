Passive Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Dead as dead can be"
My doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability
To become my perfect enemy

[Chorus]
Wake up and face me
Don't play dead 'cause maybe
Someday, I will walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way
[Verse 2]
Leanin' over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
Of what you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy

[Chorus]
Wake up (Why can't you?)
And face me (Come on now)
Don't play dead (Don't play dead)
'Cause maybe ('Cause maybe)
Someday (Someday)
I will walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
You're better off this—
You're better off this—
Maybe you're better off—
You might also like[Chorus]
Wake up (Why can't you?)
And face me (Come on now)
Don't play dead (Don't play dead)
'Cause maybe ('Cause maybe)
Someday (Someday)
I will walk away and say
"You fucking disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

[Post-Chorus]
Go ahead and play dead (Go)
I know that you can hear this (Go)
Go ahead and play dead (Go)
Why can't you turn and face me? (Wake up)
Why can't you turn and face me? (Wake up)
Why can't you turn and face me? (Wake up)
Why can't you turn and face me? (Go)
You fucking disappoint me
