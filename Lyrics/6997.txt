Gucci Frames Lyrics[Verse]
I've been out here workin’ on my fitness
I got way more flexy, bae my witness
Countin' all this money, 'bout my business
Ever since you left me, I been winning (Yeah)
I bet you though that I’d say broken, but I won't (Yeah)
You had your reason to mistreat me, but you don't
I took a chance on saving me, that's not a front
While you ended up deserted and now I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Count my bags, I'm tryna move to East LA
Speedin' down 20, blazin', switchin’ lanes
You wanna be my friend now and it’s such a shame
[Chorus]
But trouble, I can't see you through my Gucci Frames (Frames)
Through my Gucci Frames (Frames)
Trouble, I can’t see you through my Gucci Frames (Frames)
Gucci Frames (Frames, yeah)
Trouble I can't see you through my Gucci Frames (Frames)

[Outro]
