TranslationsTürkçePortuguês日本語ItalianoComatose Lyrics[Intro]
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose

[Verse 1]
You were my best friend, now you're dead to me
Sad you've become my worst memory
You played the victim in reality
You never were
[Pre-Chorus]
Straight coats and empty cabinets
Ashes from all the mess you left
New lease without you
I confess that I'm happy you're gone

[Chorus]
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose

[Verse 2]
So used to pain that it's my remedy
Easy to hate, I gave you everything
Funny that you're the one that ran away
You left me first

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight coats and empty cabinets
Ashes from all the mess you left
New lease without you
I confess that I'm happy you're gone
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose

[Bridge]
You wasted all my fucking time
Were never really in my life
You were further than I could imagine
I loved you, but fuck you

[Chorus]
I don't care enough to miss you
After all the shit we've been through
My heart's comatose, comatose

[Outro]
I don't care enough, care enough
My heart's comatose
My heart's comatose, comatose36Embed
