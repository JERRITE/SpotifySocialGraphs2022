Butchieâ€™s Tune Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't give me a place for my memories to stay
Don't show me an end or a light to find the way
I ain't got time for the things on your mind
And I'm leavin' you today
On my way

[Verse 2]
Please don't you cry when the time to part has come
It's not for what you've said or anything that you've done
I've got to go anywhere any time
And I'm leavin', gone today
On my way
I'm goin' home
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Please don't stick around to see me when I'm feelin' low
Don't pass the cards to me to deal the crushin' blow
I'll even close the door so you won't see me go
When I'm leavin', gone today
I'm on my way

[Verse 4]
I'll walk away like a shadow in the night
I won't give cause for you to feel we have to fight
I'll make it easy so that you won't really - quite
Know I'm leavin' you today
On my way
And now I'm goin'You might also likeEmbed
