Born Ready Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't believe in no devil
'Cause I done raised this hell
I've been the last one standing
When all the giants fell

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't shiver
I won't shake
I'm made of stone
I don't break
[Chorus]
Start me up
Open my eyes
Turn me loose and you'll see why
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready
Staring at the pressure now
I won't quit, not backing down
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready

[Verse 2]
I am the unknown fighter
A dark horse coming for you
I'm gonna push up higher
I'm gonna do what I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't shiver
I won't shake
I'm made of stone
I don't break

[Chorus]
Start me up
Open my eyes
Turn me loose and you'll see why
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready
Staring at the pressure now
I won't quit, not backing down
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready

Keep pushing up higher
Keep pushing up
Keep pushing up higher, higher
Keep pushing up

[Interlude]
Keep pushing up higher, higher
Keep pushing up

[Chorus]
Start me up
Open my eyes
Turn me loose and you'll see why
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready
Staring at the pressure now
I won't quit, not backing down
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready

[Post-Chorus]
Keep pushing up higher, higher
Keep pushing up
Keep pushing up higher, higher
Keep pushing up
[Outro]
Start me up
Open my eyes
Turn me loose and you'll see why
I was born, born ready
I was born, born ready3Embed
