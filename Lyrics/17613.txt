Narcotic (Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike Remix vs. Ummet Ozcan Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
What were do right here
Is go back way back
Back into time

[Hook]
I don't mind it, I think so
I will let you go
I don’t mind it, I think so
I will let you go
[Chorus]
If you don't mind, then we just let go
If you don't mind, then we just let go
If you don’t mind, then we just let go
If you don't mind, then we just let go
If don't you mind it
If you don't mind it
If you don't mind it

[Drop]
Bring the bass back huh

[Chorus]
If don't you mind it
If you don't mind it
If you don't mind it
If don’t you mind it

[Drop 2]
