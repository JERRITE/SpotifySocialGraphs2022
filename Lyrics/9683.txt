I Still Love Her Lyrics[Intro: Qusai]
Been around the world (Been around the world)
And I've heard it all before (And I've heard it all before)
And I've heard it all before
Let's take 'em back to the old school
So here we go again, so here we go again
It's just me and my friend

Yo, check one, two
Yes yes y'all in the place to be, hey
All I need is two turntables and a microphone for this one Mr. DJ
Holler at the break dancers and the graffiti artists to do they thang
And let me be the MC
Here we go, true story, maan
[Verse 1: Qusai]
I met this girl when I was twelve years old
And what I like about her she has so much soul
It was around the time I first heard LL
N.W.A., the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
She was born around the same time I was born
So it was meant to be, 'cause she got it going on
When we first met, it was love of first sight
Like an angel, she took me from the dark to the light
She started in New York and I started in Jeddah
So I wrote her a letter saying I wanna get witcha
In the early 90s, I got to know her better
The type of girl, that's down for whatever
She had a mood swing though kinda like me
And she got a job working for the music industry
So I said me too, 'cause I wanna do that
I guess we're stuck with each other and that's a matter of fact
'Cause I

[Hook: Xriss Jor & Qusai]
Been around the world
I got to see so many places, faces and races
And I've heard it all before
Yeah, so here we go again
It will never ever change
It would always be the same
It's just me and my friend

We went on tour together, did shows together
Radio and TV interviews together
Magazine covers, and newspaper headlines
'Cause we like the spotlight, and the way it shines
She's very expressive with her street knowledge
Ebonical slang, she didn't have to go to college
'Cause she's the teacher, and I'm her student
And when I graduate, I'ma teach fluent all her elements;
History, versatility
'Cause what we have is more than just a chemistry
And I wanted to impress her with my style
Little did I know her middle name is versatile
Djing, Mcing, Graffiti and Breaking
So much in common, there is no mistaking
Every where I go I see her and hear her
When I'm alone I feel her and read her, so I right!

[Hook: Xriss Jor & Qusai]
Been around the world
I got to see so many places, faces and races
And I've heard it all before
Yeah, so here we go again
It will never ever change
It would always be the same
It's just me and my friend
Together forever 'til the end
[Verse 3: Qusai]
Now she's international and universal
Worldwide exposure, you see her in commercials
Constantly changing, sometimes I don't approve
But I can't knock her hustle, 'cause she's making moves
She might sold out with few things she's faking
If I don't like it I don't like it, doesn't mean that I'm hating
But that's the way it is, she gets funky with it
I can't resist a single minute man
She could be down with the gangstas
The voice of the streets, the power, the people, the words, the beats
Awareness, conscious, class, ghetto
Underground,  mainstream, hardcore, mellow
We both had purpose that's why we were conceived
But we both were distracted by what we see
It's kinda like a love hate relationship but I still love her
And that's it, hip hop

[Hook: Xriss Jor & Qusai]
Been around the world
I got to see so many places, faces and races
And I've heard it all before
Yeah, so here we go again
It will never ever change
It would always be the same
It's just me and my friend
Hip hop and I
Together forever 'til the end

[Outro: Qusai]
It ain't nuttin like hip hop musicEmbed
