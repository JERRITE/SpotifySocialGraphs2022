Spitfire Riddim (Boombox Cartel Remix) Lyrics[Intro: twoton]
Madsonik, twoton, and Kill the Noise, Kill the Noise
Madsonik, twoton, and Kill the Noise, Kill the Noise

[Chorus: twoton]
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Pussy boy test, we make a pussy retire, wah
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Bun off the roof, watch the flame get higher, higher
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
If a pussy try test, we make him retire, wah
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Bun off the roof, wah

Push the vibe up
Uh, spitfire

Kill and destroy
You know we don't play around, no
