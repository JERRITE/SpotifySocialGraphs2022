Crep Shop Lyrics[Intro: RV, Bandokay, Double Lz & SJ]
(Brigades)
(MKThePlug)
Out here in the concrete jungle
Gotta treat these opps like prey (Prey)
Just got a chase from jakes
But I got away, sorry, not today
I just got a chase, it's mad
It's a mad ting so I hide from jihadis (Hiding)
Decamp from gang, .32 goes bang (Bow)
Grease it so the mash don't jam
Me and S in the ride, two loaded waps
No flick shanks can’t get backed on man (They can't)
Car doors pop and the opps get prang
No cap, it's best for you to not lack
Get sent south side, no Bagel
Fuck a Bagel, slap corn at your Mac D's
These dumb little opp boys can't at me (Woi)
Try Gun Lean and get shot from the back seat
RV
[Verse 1: RV]
Bro was itching to get down my man
But I told him, "leave him for me" (Leave him)
That boy is mine like Monica and Brandy
I'll shave man's wig like Andy (Shave that)
I called the new wap Patrick
Cah I roll with the Star like Sandy (Ah)
Shh got shh, held one in his leg
And now he can't walk like Bambi (Pissed)
Keep tools in the ride at all times
Never know when they might come in handy (Never know)
I was in jail watching Hollyoaks
Same time Darren was cheating with Mandy (Stress)
I don't feel them yutes so I spilled man's juice
Shank game on cranberry (Ching)
Bad B wanna come to the Nizz and off them panties
Meet me at Tangy

[Verse 2: Bandokay]
Bando, I'll slap this gladly on the back street
Turn guys into athletes (Dash off)
I'm in the nizz, .44, that's Tangy
With a bad B backing it for a mad G
Man slapped at your tracksuits
Get round there and dash off two batteries, mad greeze (Dashing)
Man hide from jihadis, Ali's
Get round there with Rambos and ballys (Ching)
Bando, man's trappy, slappy
On the other hand tryna make mum happy (Happy)
My aunty's telling me I'm a bad breed
I'm a bad breed, spill juice like cranberry (Man spill it)
Boogie B gets splashy, free up my akhi
Bro-bro weren't no patty (Free bro)
The Niners too chatty, gang get tappy
Gyal on my line too catty (Catty)
You might also like[Chorus: RV]
Everyday I wake and pray
Thank God I ain't rubbed like them lot (Paigons)
I do bits like Love Island
My line don't ring for no ten shot (Ring)
Red card, get him sent off
Ching man's head, now he's looking like Lescott (Ching)
Just got new boots, I copped me a 9
But I never went to a crep shop
Everyday I wake and pray
Thank God I ain't rubbed like them lot (Paigons)
I do bits like Love Island
My line don't ring for no ten shot (Ring)
Red card, get him sent off
Ching man's head, now he's looking like Lescott (Ching)
Just got new boots, I copped me a 9
But I never went to a crep shop

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Three car doors get popped in the A
Man lurk on the 2's like I'm from that place
Catch me a opp, man cheffing that straight
Shave man, dip him up and then skate
What you know 'bout big fat shank on your waist?
Or a tinted dinger containing the gauge? (Bow)
Slap this dots, shells fly in your face
Back to the block, L2 get blazed
Kway back then used to roll with the kitch'
Now it's same size as a walking stick
Test me and bro, then you're taking a risk
You'll see me in the late night patrolling your strip (You will)
'Till a black male get shot or chinged
It's straight opp boys, no innocent shit
My yute run, you don't wanna get hit
That yute's broke but I made him drip
[Verse 4: SJ]
I could've been on the pitch doing rainbow flicks
But instead I'm in the trap with this Rambo (In the bando)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
My marj hates it but my fans don’t (Sorry marj)
This life is peak and I know it's the streets
So let me tell you how my gang roll
I'm in Southampton with this fifteen inch
New jewels now we see man in Zandos
If I could, I'll share my age
But most of you would think that this kid is bluffing (He's bluffing)
But let me show you suttin'
I done more things than most man in this ting, it's nuttin' (Trust me)
But don't start judging
I'm just telling you about this shitty little life that I'm stuck in (Shit life)
My friends in jail, my opps in hell
And the verbal abuse keeps coming (Dead up, dead up)

[Chorus: RV]
Everyday I wake and pray
Thank God I ain't rubbed like them lot (Paigons)
I do bits like Love Island
My line don't ring for no ten shot (Ring)
Red card, get him sent off
Ching man's head, now he's looking like Lescott (Ching)
Just got new boots, I copped me a 9
But I never went to a crep shop
Everyday I wake and pray
Thank God I ain't rubbed like them lot (Paigons)
I do bits like Love Island
My line don't ring for no ten shot (Ring)
Red card, get him sent off
Ching man's head, now he's looking like Lescott (Ching)
Just got new boots, I copped me a 9
But I never went to a crep shop6Embed
