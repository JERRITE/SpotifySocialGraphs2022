A Strange Encounter Lyrics(Verse)
Are we all friends? Are we sent to defend you or keep you in?
We're not so hard, we're the first to forget what it takes to fight
We're on your side, we're be there from the start
Till you get it right
Our paths have crossed, in the order of things we're just so lost
And closer still, it we think with our heads we can feel so high
And loosing ground, so the distance between is can keep us alive

(Chorus)
Are we only a few lonely hearts filling time in an empty jar?
Are we ever part, the delusion which's greater than we first thought
We're so surrealYou might also like2Embed
