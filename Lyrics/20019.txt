InDirect Message Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crystal ball ain't say no shit I wanna hear
The way I rage, my arms are big, you'd think that I was on the gear
I'm up late at night figuring out who the one that drank my beer
And I'll smash them like a Brit, I'm talking country not no Spears
You see me out here, all black, in the tree line
My girl she is a feline and no my card don't decline
Wanna see the behind, pull up with them dream eyes
Get rid of all them weak guys and yeah just only be mine

[Chorus]
Out here I'm flexing with an Alexis from Texas
She wanna talk to my neck and then maybе get in my Lexus
And I'm caressing thе dress and then then remembering stresses
Of all the times I've sent same messages to separate addresses
[Verse 2]
Cross hanging upon my back, Off-White like the Pope
The way I weave and bob and duck and dive you don't want this smoke
Up in the AM, watch Akira, but no Asa involved
Geeks be peeking, now they leaking out on the road
Drop top in a road block, turning up my beat
Young Nagasaki, young volcano man, he spray that heat
And I defeat these feeble neeks in only Gucci and jeans
What time I be there? Bieber first name, right at the scene

[Verse 3]
What time I be there? Bieber first name, right at the scene
Wildin' like I'm Riley, fly to Bali to read
Play 'em like Atari, probably die before I see
I'll be bathing on safari, camouflaged to the tee
I'll be with my bag
Origami paper planes, Elizabeth on the back
My flow deliberate, I don't limit it, don't be mad
You're still illiterate, I contribute it to your dad, I'll be

[Chorus]
Out here I'm flexing with an Alexis from Texas
She wanna talk to my neck and then maybe get in my Lexus
And I'm caressing the dress and then then remembering stresses
Of all the times I've sent same messages to separate addresses

Drop top in a road block, turning up my beat
Drop top in a road block, in a road block1Embed
