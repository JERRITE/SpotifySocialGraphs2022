Letter 2 U Lyrics[Intro]
You said you gonna love me every night and day (Yeah)
And I promise you that I will do the same (Oh, oh)
And I know that nobody will treat you the same way
Let me talk my shit (Oh, woah)
(Oh woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 1]
I just finished up rippin' up all these love letters
I wish me and you coulda had fell in love better (Oh woah)
I'ma call it how you are, you was flawless from the start
You think I'm a piece a shit, I wasn't cautious with your heart
And now you buggin' on my government (Oh)
Not the type to judge but you be movin' on some other shit
Girl you know my jewelry too expensive for you to grab it when I'm fuckin' you
You know how to make a nigga feel uncomfortable, oh woah
I wish I could feel the same way (Same way)
I broke up with you and I fucked your friend the same day (Same day)
I know you don't feel the same way (Same way)
Yeah
Said she only fuck with drug dealers, move like she don't love niggas
Leave your heart up to his hands, he was movin' dumb with it
She know I'm a thug nigga, never show no love nigga
She keep fuckin' up my plans (Fuck), she know I got trust issues
Couple thousand dollars on your body, got you confident (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We posted in the Yams whippin' Lambs, that's accomplishments
Treat you like my son, if I make a move you follow it
I'ma put it on her tongue, I'm tryna see if shawty swallow it
[Chorus]
You know I don't love you how I wish I could
You know I don't treat you how I wish I could
But it's you I want, oh, oh
It's you I want, oh
I know you don't love me how you wish you could
I know you don't treat me how you wish you could
But it's me you want, oh, oh
It's me you want, yeah

[Verse 2]
I be trippin' off your love, but I could never let no sweat drop
I ain't trippin' off no scrub, couple in the clip, we count head shots
Treat these rappers like my sons, I be movin' like they step pops
Fuckin' up your sheets, I know how to make your bed rock
Took a couple shots, I'm tryna take you out your comfort zone
Bringin' up my opps, I gotta worry who you fuckin' on
She put Justin on her lips, I gotta worry who she suckin' on
Used to always take a risk, just to say you was my bitch (Say you was my bitch)
And I heard you be fuckin' on your close friends
She got way too comfortable and took me off her close friends
You know I can't trust nobody, that's why I got no friends (No-no)
I put diamonds on your body, just so they could notice
I wrote a letter to my last bitch
My new bitch (Oh woah), gotta be better then my last bitch (Oh woah)
'Cause I done been through mad shit (Oh woah)
And I was never tryna treat you like a savage
Had to let these streets pick you up 'cause you came with baggage

You said you gonna love me every night and day
And I promise you that I will do the same
And I know that nobody will treat you the same way
Let me talk my shit

[Chorus]
You know I don't love you how I wish I could
You know I don't treat you how I wish I could
But it's you I want, oh, oh
It's you I want, oh
I know you don't love me how you wish you could
I know you don't treat me how you wish you could
But it's me you want, oh, oh
It's me you want, oh

[Outro]
You said you gonna love me every night and day
And I promise you that I will do the same
And I know that nobody will treat you the same way
