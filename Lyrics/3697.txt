Translations한국어RomanizationTAEMIN - 이데아 (IDEA:理想) (English Translation) LyricsSmall projection made by reason
You grow on instinct
Deep dreams
With the night in one's arms
Deepening shadow

In me
Under under under under
Under under under under
Beautiful silhouette
Sweet Voices
It drives me crazy Umm
You are my messiah
You are my
(killing me)
(Killing me softly)

I can't see, I can't hold
Define me anew before I know it
Everything in me doubles
It's the hottest breath I've ever seen

Undеr under under under
Undеr under under under
Beautiful silhouette
Sweet Voices
It drives me crazy Umm
You are my messiah
You are my
(killing me)

You are you are you are

My my IDEA My my IDEA
A dangerous dream that swallowed me
You're proving it's you
This tremor deep in the heart
You are my messiah (Killing me softly)
You might also likePerception is beyond the limits
Your shadow that you finally found
Everything you can't see
The moment that made me believe
Throw me beyond that

Flowing on me
The blue light
When you and I face each other
Stained in it
All one's feelings
It's an infinite range
In my world
Most dazzling
The absolute value of you
My my IDEA
You are you are you are (killing me)

My ah-ah My-ah-ah My-ah My-I-DE-A (You are)
My ah-ah My-ah-ah My-ah-ah-ah (Umm)

My ah-ah My-ah-ah My
You are you are you are

My my IDEA My my IDEA
A dangerous dream that swallowed me
You're proving it's you
This tremor deep in the heart
You are my messiah
(Killing me softly)
(Killing me softly Killing me soft)
The night that cut you out of me
(Killing me softly Killing me soft)
I finally opened my eyesEmbed
