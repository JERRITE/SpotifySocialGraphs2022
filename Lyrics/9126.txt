Looks That Kill Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now listen up
She's a razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Now she's a cool, cool black
She moves like a cat
If you don't get her name
Well, you might not make it back

[Chorus]
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the look
(She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill)
[Verse 2]
Now she's bulletproof
She keeps her motor clean
And believe me, you
She's a number thirteen
The church strikes midnight
She's looking louder and louder
She's going to turn on our juice, boy
So she turns on the power

[Chorus]
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the look
(She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got the look)

[Verse 1]
Now listen up
She's a razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Now she's a cool, cool black
Moves like a cat
If you don't get her name
You might not make it back
You might also like[Chorus]
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the looks that kill, that kill, oh
She's got the look
(She got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill)

[Outro]
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill
She's got looks that kill6Embed
