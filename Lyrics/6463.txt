We Are Legends Lyrics[Verse]
We are living on the run
Like a legacy undone
Shining brighter than the sun
Cause we are legends

[Chorus]
And we'll leave on in memories
On the pages of history
Forever you'll remember me
Cause we are legends
Cause we are legends
[Post-Chorus]
One day we'll leave this world behind
And say goodbye
But you and I will redefine
Space and time

[Verse]
Cause we are living on the run
Like a legacy undone
Shining brighter than the sun
Cause we are legends

[Chorus]
And we'll live on in memories
On the pages of history
Forever you'll remember me
Cause we are legends
Cause we are legendsYou might also likeEmbed
