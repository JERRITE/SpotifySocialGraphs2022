TranslationsTürkçeEspañolFrançais​somebody loves you Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spent four hours in the city
Just to see if you would miss me
Nowhere feels the same as Brooklyn
Dancing like nobody's lookin'

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what a dream
If we could be subtle lovers
In the suburbs
And all I can see
Are my philosophies
Going under 'cause
[Chorus]
Somebody loves you
Somebody loves you
I'm trying not to
But somebody loves you

[Verse 2]
Taking pics you're never sending
This hole I'm in is never-ending
It's lonely here without your laughter
And I'm afraid of what comes after

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what a dream
If we could be subtle lovers
In the suburbs
And all I can see
Are my philosophies
Going under 'cause

[Chorus]
Somebody loves you
Somebody loves you
I'm trying not to
But somebody loves you
Somebody loves you (Loves you)
Somebody loves you (Loves you)
And I'm trying not to, oh (Loves you)
But somebody loves you (Loves you)

I got too much energy
To be stable mentally
I've realized since therapy
That I'm my greatest enemy
Whatever's decided in the end
I'll be your fondest summer friend
Fuck if I'm far from falling off
I'm not alone and I'm not lost (Yeah)
Still, I know (Still, I know)
I get so caught up
So, I'm sorry, are you lonely?
Are you tired? Are you falling?
Well, it's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause somebody loves you (Loves you)
Somebody loves you (Loves you)
And I'm trying not to, oh (Loves you)
But somebody loves you (Loves you)5Embed
