TranslationsEspañolNot Ok Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I left, who's counting anyway?
But for me the only thing that’s changed
Is the distance between New York and LA
Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I was so easily replaced
It's so strange how I recognize her face
But tell me, does she make you feel the same?
Kills me to know she's sleeping in my place
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s midnight and I'm wasted
So wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm calling you up again
I know I might be crazy
So crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm calling you just to say

[Chorus]
I’m not okay
I just called you to say (Ooh)
I’m not okay (Oh)
I just called you to say (Ooh)
I'm not okay

[Drop]
I’m not okay

[Verse 2]
Medicate
With whiskey and cheap wine
But it don't stop this train wreck in my mind
My friends all say that all will heal in time
But the truth is it don't give me peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's midnight and I’m wasted
So wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm calling you up again
I know I might be crazy
So crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm calling you just to say
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I just called you to say (Ooh)
I'm not okay (Oh)
I just called you to say (Ooh)
I'm not okay

[Drop]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not, I'm not okay (Ooh)
I just called you to say (Oh)
I just called you to say (Ooh)
I'm not okay15Embed
