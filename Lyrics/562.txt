[Verse 1]
Hoes mad (Woo), hoes mad (Skrrt), I pull up in that old Jag' (Skrrt)
Ho fast (Yoom), I got these bitches staring (They what?), comparing (Woo)
If that's your girl, not sharing (No, no), that's past tense (Skrrt)
I be flexing (Woo), I say, "Baby, why you hating (Why?) and you wanna drink my liquor?" (Wanna drink my, what?)
But I ain't even tripping, Irv, please pass me a Swisher (Swish)
Smoking dope 'til I get hiccups (Woo), I think I need a pick up (Let's get it)
So wanna pick me up, 'cause these pills got me real high up
But these hoes mad (They what?), hoes mad (Hoes mad)
I think I fucked her best friend (Her what?), her cousin (Her what?)
I got these bitches staring (They what?)
They fighting (Skrrt), they texting me some weird shit
Oh man, hoes mad (Let's get it)

Hoes mad, hoes mad (Tell me why you mad), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad (This ho for real?), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad (Why is you mad?), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad (Why?), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad (Tell me why you mad), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad (Why?), hoes mad
Hoes mad, hoes mad, hoes mad

Oh man (What?), oh man (Fuck), I'm busting hard, let me call Flash (Flash)
Pull up fast (Skrrt), two bitches tried to set me up (What?), almost blasted (Boom!)
15 up in that pocket rocket (Skrrt), bitch think fast (Woo)
I can't go, yes I gotta keep it on me
Bitch, I'm going out like Tony (Like Tony)
I heard these bitches sneaky, tried to get me by my lonely (Skrrt)
I'm a dub, bitch, not a dummy (No dummy)
I'm all about some money (My money), and where the fuck the liquor?
Drinking Henny 'til I'm scummy (Skrrt)
Whole time (What?), whole time (What?), I'm flexing hard like Busta Rhymes (Skrrt)
You worth a dime, I'm all about my Peso, yayo (Yayo)
Need all mine, yo' bitch, she on my other line (What?)
