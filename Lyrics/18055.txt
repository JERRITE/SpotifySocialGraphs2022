​through the looking glass Lyrics[Verse 1]
I fall asleep inside your arms
Oh, it's a scary kind of warmth
There's suicide behind your eyes
But you look so good (Ooh)
If I could crawl up in your bones
It'd be a different kind of home
I'm fighting fire everywhere I go
But it burns so good (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me fall back down again
So I can be at your feet
And let me drink your poison
So I can see what you see
[Chorus]
So change, change the rhythm of my heart
Tell my story where to start and where to end
'Cause without you I'll forget
I can't change, change myself with my own hands
Take your knife and carve me over, and ovеr again (Mm)

[Verse 2]
And if you're lying, I don't mind
If I can fake it, then I'll try
Your gildеd crown, your perfect crime
Oh, you got me good (Ooh)
I think about you all the time
You're like a movie in my mind
I play your part and press rewind
And I look so good (Ooh)

[Chorus]
So change, change the rhythm of my heart
Tell my story where to start and where to end
'Cause without you I'll forget
I can't change, change myself with my own hands
Take your knife and carve me over and over again (Mm)

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I feel it closing in
Let the end begin
And change the rhythm of my heart
Tell my story where to start and where to end
'Cause I'm trying to forgetYou might also likeEmbed
