With Ur Love (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Cher Lloyd]
Da da da da dum dum, da dum dum
Da da da da dum dum, da dum dum
Da da da da dum dum, da dum dum
Da da da da dum dum

[Verse 1: Cher Lloyd]
Baby, you the best 'cause you worked me out
I keep building walls up, but you tear 'em down
I'm fighting, I don't wanna like it, but you know I like it
But you know I like it, like it, like it
Used to always think I was bullet proof
But you got an AK and you're blowing through
Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it
I want you to know it, know it, know it
[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game ('Cause they know that you own it)
You got this swag, you got this attitude
Wanna hear you say my name
'Cause you got me...

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Flying with your love
Shining with your love
Riding with your love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
One hit with your love
Can't quit with your love
So sick, but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love

[Verse 2: Cher Lloyd]
Everybody wants what I got with you
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million, million, million
I ain't even here, I'm in outer space
Like I'm Venus, you're Mars in the Milky Way
It's crazy what you're doing to me, how you do it to me
How you do it to me, to me, to me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
All of them other boys can walk away (Walk away now, just walk away)
They ain't even in the game ('Cause they know that you own it)
You got this swag, you got this attitude (La la la la la)
Wanna hear you say my name (Say my name)
'Cause you got me...

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Flying with your love
Shining with your love
Riding with your love (Yeah)
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
(I'm on top of the world)
One hit with your love (Yeah)
Can't quit with your love
So sick, but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Uh-huh, yo
I’m in love, man, I’m trippin' (Mhm)
I’m smoking on that sticky  (Mhm)
My chick look like Nia Long, your chick look like Miss Piggy  (Mhm)
And my chick is foreign, got a white girl like Iggy (Yes, sir)
I get so much money, I hypnotise, I’m like Biggie (Biggie)
I’m rollin' up and we flyin' out
My kush love Lassari
Me and her in a Lamborghini, getting high ride with the high beams (With the high beams)
My girl been ballin', she like Sheryl Swoopes
While you fuckin' with an ex-baller, shaped like hoops
[Bridge: Cher Lloyd]
'Cause you got me
Flying, baby, I'm shining, baby
I'm riding with your love (Hey, hey)
One hit, baby, I can't quit, baby
I'm so sick, but so what? (Hey, hey)
Flying, baby, I'm shining, baby (I'm shining, I'm shining, yeah)
I'm riding with your love
One hit, baby, I can't quit, baby
I'm so sick, but so what? (Yeah, I'm on top of the world)

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Flying with your love
Shining with your love (la la la la la)
Riding with your love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
(I'm on top of the world)
One hit with your love
Can't quit with your love
So sick, but so what?
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
