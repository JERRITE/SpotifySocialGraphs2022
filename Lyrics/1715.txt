Orionâ€™s Belt Lyrics[Verse 1]
This mess of emotions got his body questioning
"Is this feeling alright?"
He's studying my freckles like the constellations
And he's lookin' for signs

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're not used to this
Boy, will you let me teach you?
Your mind is askin' for my love
And you just need to hear it
Try not to wander off too much
Don't let your fears control you
Keep you attentive with authentic kisses
Filled with amor
[Chorus]
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel
When we meet at Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel

[Verse 2]
Runnin' my fingers through your hair, I'm feeling
That your thoughts have left the surface
Is it worth it? Yes
Is it genuine? Can I love like this?
Let me give you some reasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're not used to this
Boy, will you let me teach you?
Your mind is askin' for my love
And you just need to hear it
Try not to wander off too much
Don't let your fears control you
Keep you attentive with authentic kisses
Filled with amor

[Chorus]
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel
When we meet at Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel

When your hand's running down my thigh
It's like a ticket to a cosmic sky
Let your body get used to this
Let your body get used to this
It don't matter where we are
'Cause when we touch, we are caressing stars
Let your body get used to this
Let your body get used to this

[Chorus]
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel
When we meet at Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How we're supposed to feel6Embed
