TranslationsPortuguêsOHMAMI Lyrics[Intro: Mitchel Cave]
Bitch, I'm fuckin' styling (Ooh)
Yeah (Ooh, oh)
Yeah (Woah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Cuban link, diamond cross
I got a Spanish chiquita
"No habla inglés," not at all, no
Cut up three lines like Adidas
She clean that shit up with her nose
And I got a kilo, no Kilimanjaro
Baby, just a mountain of coke
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Ooh, mami, this a new 'Rari
Hit one-fifty on the dash, I bent the corner
Then she bent it for me sideways, ah
I might have to fuck her on the highway
Yeah, ooh, woah
Ooh, mami, I got blue molly
I throw Louis V, Supreme on top of Murakami
Bitch, I'm fuckin' styling, yeah
I might say I love her, but I'm liking
Yeah-ah, yeah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Oh no, no, no, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Christian Anthony]
Mamacita, I can see the Devil in your eyes
Muy bonita, tú quieres estar by my side
She might make me stay in for the night
For the night, oh-oh-oh
Call Maria, let's get drunk
I haven't been out for a month
Got a two-liter in the back
And another bottle in the trunk
Colombian gold in the front seat
The foreign girls showin' me love
Tellin' your friends that you hate me
But I know you can't get enough
You might also like[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Ooh, mami, this a new 'Rari
Hit one-fifty on the dash, I bent the corner
Now, now bend it for me sideways, ah
I might have to fuck her on the highway (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah, yeah, woah

[Verse 3: Mitchel Cave]
Ooh, oh my
I don't wanna take this call
I'm too high, red eyes
She might even take the fall if I ask her
Baby, pop it backwards
Actin' extra, but she never been an actress, yeah
Ah shit
Oh yeah, yeah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh shit

[Bridge: Mitchel Cave]
I said, I said, "Ooh mami, this a new 'Rari"
Bitch, I'm fuckin' styling, I don't need no stylist
All of my dogs, they be ridin'

[Verse 4: Mitchel Cave]
Shit
Fuck a double date (Shit)
Double-down on everything I say (Shit)
You can bring your friend, but she don't get to stay (Hey)
Guarantee she end up leavin' anyway
Never play, dog, watch out (Watch out)
Dark flames when my doors swing out (Swing out)
Switch lanes on a one-way route
Switchblade make your blood pour out
Make it rain in a drought
Hop in, hop out
Motherfucker, get down when I say, "Down"
Brown duffle bag, I fill it up with thirty clip rounds
Drop shit, pop wheelies, fuck a breakdown
I don't give a—
Bitch, I'ma slide either way
Please do not try me today
I seen the static from a mile away
She wanna fuck me, okay
She wanna know how it tastes
[Outro: Mitchel Cave]
Yeah, yeah
Fuck all that talkin', I'm restless
Yeah
I pray that I don't get arrested
Pray that you wake up for breakfast
Pray that you wake up for breakfast24Embed
