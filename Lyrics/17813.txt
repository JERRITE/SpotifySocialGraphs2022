9 Bridge Lyrics[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I know I don't never make promises
This time, I mean it, I promise

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
If I tell you, "I got you," my nigga, I got you
If I say, "I love you," my nigga, I love you forever
Don't listen to rumors, 'til you run it by me
Don't even panic, I know you're my man
Let's just hold that shit down like we Bobby and Rowdy
I'ma let you know if you movin' sloppy
Don't say that you got me when you never looked
Used to go to the PJs, meet up in the lobby
Now we on the PJ, right to Abu Dhabi
[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
I just bought me a Mulsanne, took her to Spain, she ate me like chicken lo mein
I just FaceTimed thе whole gang
They in LA, they on thеy way to the Bay
Tell 'em I'll soon be there, jet soon here
Nigga, I put that on 'Kane
I'm in Tampa Bay, straight, I made some bands today, ayy

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Stylist get the style for me, nah, nah, I Amiri the jeans
Hold up, I ain't never froze up, 'til I went to Elliott, now I see
Clarity in my baguetties and VV's
Apparently all of my niggas are fleas
Louis Vuitton all the time, I got a house on my arm all the time
All of my pieces is from Eliantte

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]
They catch me drippin' in front the Barclay
Catch me flying down the Parkway
Smokin' backpack, broccoli
It's just me and Boogie, back-to-back
In a Maybach, nigga, pardon me
Got my feet up with my heat tucked
If them lil' niggas start me, but it's

[Verse 4: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Fuck everybody, that's just how I feel, I ain't feelin' nobody
I pop on a pill when I'm flyin' in private, it give me the chills
And I land to an Audi, paranoid, that's why I move in silence
They ain't playin' fair, I move with the chopper
Hit up broski, he gon' tear up the spot
Watch the pocket-rocket put him right on his pockets

Huh?
Yes, I came up from nothing
Had no shmoney, no clothes, had to get it from nothing
I put the pot in the oven, mixin' and bakin' and cookin' that bitch with my cousin
He said he hot, but he wasn't
She said she not but she fuckin', I got that thot bussin'
I got my jewelry bussin'
I got my jewelry hittin', that's end of discussion

[Verse 6: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Rowdy Rebel]
Nineteen, I had dropped out of college
My favorite way to get money was the block
I got too addicted to the money, I'm honest
They thought I was tryna be Speaker Knockerz
I ain't tryna go out like Speaker Knockerz
Rest in peace, but I keep it a hunnid
Got Ps on my head and even the knockers
I keep it G, yeah, I keep it a hunnid (Huh?)

[Verse 7: Rowdy Rebel]
I keep it G, yeah, I keep it one hunnid
I'm the one that paid the fee for the gunners
I'm the one that bought the piece for the runners
They don't run on me, I'm good with the numbers
I'ma really fuck it up for the summer
Drop-top, doin' donuts in Hummers
Opp block with a chopper, I stun on
EBK, I give a fuck 'bout a color, I ride for my brothers
[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
If I say, "I love you," my nigga, I love you forever
Don't listen to rumors, 'til you run it by me
Don't need to panic, I know you're my man
Let's just hold that shit down like we Bobby and Rowdy
I'ma let you know if you movin' sloppy
Don't say that you got me when you never looked
Used to go to the PJs, meet up in the lobby
Now we on the PJ, right to Abu Dhabi6Embed
