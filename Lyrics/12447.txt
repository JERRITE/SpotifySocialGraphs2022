Keep Fighting Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I could feel it all for you
If I could, I would take back all that you've been through
And I would find a safer place for you to run
When you've come undone
I wish I could take the pain away
If I could I would paint for you a brand new day
But for now, you've gotta hold on through the night
I know we'll survive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting
[Chorus 1] x2
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna take us out
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us now

[Verse 2]
I swear, this storm is nothing more than noise
And I won't let it push you past the breaking point
We'll stand, together we will hold our ground
I'm not backing down
Cause I, I'll never lose my faith in you
And I won't forget the things you've brought me through
You're the one, the one who'll never leave my side
Till the day we die

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting

[Chorus 1] x2
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna take us out
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Go ahead and don't be afraid
The fire inside you can't be contained
Go ahead and don't be afraid
The fire inside you can't be contained

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting
Oh no, I'm never gonna let it go
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep fighting

[Chorus 1] x2
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Nothing's gonna take us out
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us now1Embed
