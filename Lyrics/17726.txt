Mad About Bars - S5-E12 LyricsPart I

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
You ready for another spoiler?
Kazza
I've always been a man of bold predictions
And I'm predictin' that this guy right here; star in the makin'
Comin' outta' West London, some of you may know the name
But for those who don't, it's my guy, Central Cee

[Verse: Central Cee]
If you got what it takes I'll take it
This shit took ages
Should know that you can't rush greatness
But you're too impatient
One million views ain't famous
Need me a crib no neighbours, mad
Need me a thousand acres
Can't wait 'til a man's on stages
I'm just not at that stage yet
Million views I'm grateful, love
Broski thinks that I've made it
What's the long term vision?
2M in my daughter's savin'
Cats fell back and I thought he fainted
Dirty trap, hope the jakes don't raid it
Pissed when I took that L
I thought 'bout jail and I stopped complainin'
Don't know 'bout drought
Spoke to the plug just now and a lot just came in
Bro's over the pot just whippin'
You know that the plot just twistin'
Bro done a whole lot of missions
Meanwhile, whole of your block just bitchin'
So it don't make sense
Sellin' them party drugs, why'd you think that I'm up, 4AM
Link my shqipe for the rawest yay
Don't you know that talk is bait?
Same way bro caught that case
When I make 10M might call it a day
I was young and I still invested
Cah I'm business minded
Stay in the trap or rap, or both, I'm indecisive
I was bando sofa surfin'
Observe, I overheard 'em
One sign I'll burn that bridge, might go left if I miss this turnin'
Can't make my mind up, I'm in two minds
Not once did I think 'bout quittin', I always knew that I'd blow due time
I always knew that ho weren't mine (Ha, ha)
I always knew them boys won't ride (Real shit)
Why'd you think that I rode on my own more time
Let the game commence
I'm upfront, they play the bench
I heard who's up next?, the city been sayin' Baby I'm board on the dinger had to tell B I don't have no children
I'm not in the mood for pics, I'm hearin' kids sayin' swear that's him
They know the songs I sing, they don't know the life I live
They talk 'bout ridin', they don't know 'bout the violent side of things
They see me shinin', they don't know 'bout the grind that I put in (Woo)
Part II

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
Aye, Cench, let's be real though
2020's been a fucked up year so far
And more time, don't even look like there's light at the end of the tunnel
'Nuff unanswered questions, and I need someone to speak on it
And who better than yourself? Free the man cuz

[Verse: Central Cee]
Tough times don't last
When's the pain gonna pass
I seen olders fall off and order one light, one dark
I won't talk too much, and put that boy on blast
They call me 23 but this ain't no last dance
CEO im renowned
For stayin' months in that town
I'm not welcome in my house my mum abandoned her child
Before they try and take my chain and pull their cameras out
Imagine beefin' with a brudda on a random account
Turn the news on, ain't nothin' informative though
I'm over it now, I'm sure that this corona's a hoax
The less we know, fam it's like the more they control
If all of us spoke, then I'm pretty sure we'd evolve
Importin' that dough, my brodie dodged the border control
They gave my brudda eight years for the caller info
Had to revoke, then I started seein' results
I wonder who's gettin' called, when MPs want coke, huh
Nobody showed me love when I was grindin' but it's changed
Whenever I'm around them they all smilin' but it's fake
If music don't cut it then the grind is gonna pay
I be ghostin' all the time, I disappear, hibernate
All the women that I fuck with say I'm suttin' else
Cause I put money first and I don't really trust these girls
Had to put a penny on it, I don't trust those girls
In the trap house with my brother doin' top and tales
This ain't for the fake or the small minded
Small circle, violate we all ridin'
I got vision, this ain't for the short sighted
Free the guys and this ain't for the law abidin'
I'm from a city full of skyscrapers
Armed feds, X5s, high speed chases
Now they wanna help I don't need your favours
When I needed help I couldn't see faces
Wanna see me fail and demotivated
I ain't fuckin' with no rappers they ain't no relation
I was losin' hope, plannin' home invasions
I'm only involved in money conversations
Fuck a generation gap I relate to the masses
I don't even need to drill I could pay for the action
Central persister and I'm too reluctant
I remember I was broke, had to learn to ration
It was fun while it lasted now its my turn
Choppin' down the onion make your eyes burn
I was puttin' work in when them guys weren't
I'm flyin' straight they tryna make me divertYou might also likeEmbed
