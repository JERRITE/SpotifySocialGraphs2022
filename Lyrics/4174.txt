Guaya Lyrics[Intro]
Gimme that, Imma get that
Me talk and get done
Me talk and get done
Drum, drum
Di gyal dem, dem a come
Now talk like we
Wise up, dis ya a boss, dis ya a boss

[Verse 1]
Gwaan, bitches got a ton
Walk past man, ya we no make a run
Boy down calm, struck ya wear out ya tongue
Flesh made swallow di tongue, sauce
Ma look at jungle, hear argument
Bobman, Bobman, rescue me then
Drop me a line
You a fool, man?
Dem plots, you a bludclot lolo
[Pre-Chorus]
Dance on the floor
And my legs on a roll
We all dance to the flow
All my ladies are the truth

[Chorus]
You are what I call a señor
Oye papi, echa a los perros
(Guayando, guayando, guayando, guayando)
Guayando, guayando
Guayando, guayando
Wise up, dis ya a boss, dis ya a boss

[Post-Chorus]
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan
Guayando
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan

[Verse 2]
Gwa-gwa-gwaan
Di boy says "where you come from?
Are you from the islands? Are you from the sun?"
Doesn't matter where I come from
Flesh made swallow di tongue, sauce
We know we stylish, ra-ta-ta, ta
Got it going on, we so fly-fly-fly, fly
What you need is what we want
What you get it's all night long
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Dance on the floor
And my legs on a roll
We all dance to the flow
All my ladies are the truth

[Chorus]
You are what I call a señor
Oye papi, echa a los perros
(Guayando, guayando, guayando, guayando)
Guayando, guayando
Guayando, guayando
Wise up, dis ya a boss, dis ya a boss

[Post-Chorus]
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan
Guayando
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan
Guayando
Whoa-oh-oh

[Bridge]
See the rising sun
You can hear its sound
No one is around
Staying here, we're heaven bound
Don't worry 'bout love
We're humming words to escape the world
Wanna move 'til the morning
We won't stop 'til it's morning
[Chorus]
You are what I call a señor
Oye papi, echa a los perros
(Guayando, guayando, guayando, guayando)
Guayando, guayando
Guayando, guayando
Wise up, dis ya a boss, dis ya a boss

[Post-Chorus]
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan
Guayando
Gwaan, gwaan, gwaan
