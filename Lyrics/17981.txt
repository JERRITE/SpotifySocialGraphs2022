What Do You Know About Love? Lyrics[ANNA, spoken]
Hans is not a stranger

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Okay. So, what's his last name?

[ANNA, spoken]
Of the Southern Isles!
[KRISTOFF, spoken]
That's not a last name...
[ANNA]
You've got opinions on my life and my relations
But let me tell you what

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Okay. Enlighten me

[ANNA]
Love is the one thing that has zero complications
And I can trust my gut

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Okay. You frighten me

[ANNA]
Some people know their hearts
The minute true love starts

[KRISTOFF]
Some people read a lot of books

[ANNA, spoken]
I like books!

(sung)
Some people simply know
When true love says "Hello"!
You might also like[KRISTOFF]
Some folks are taken in by curly locks and princely looks!

[ANNA, spoken]
He does have princely looks. We agree on that one!

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Right! Ah, by the way, what color eyes does he have?

[ANNA, spoken]
Dreamy

[KRISTOFF]
All I'm sayin' is when you go to climb a mountain
You don't just jump to the top

[ANNA, spoken]
If it's true love you can!

[KRISTOFF]
There's scalin' and scramblin'
And too many steps for countin'
And the work doesn't stop

[ANNA, spoken]
Maybe for you
[KRISTOFF]
Love's not an easy climb:
You have to take your time!

[ANNA]
We get a whole life, that's the plan

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
That's not a plan!

(sung)
Love's not a thing you get
It's work and tears and sweat

[ANNA]
So says a sweaty, smelly mountain man!

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
Oh, what do you know about love?
What do you know about love?

What do you know about love?
What do you know about love?

[ANNA]
Have you even kissed a girl?
I mean, a human girl!

[KRISTOFF]
Oh

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
What do you know about
Anything, anything?

[KRISTOFF]
Anyone with half a brain
Would have worn some winter gear!
[ANNA]
Anyone with half a life
Would have one friend who's not a deer!

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
I do!

(sung)
Any fool who jumps headlong
Is gonna bang their head!

[ANNA]
Any fool who doesn't jump right now
Is probably gonna end up dead!

[KRISTOFF]
Whooooooa!

[ANNA]
Like I said

(spoken)
You okay there?

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
I've been better...

[ANNA, spoken]
You should have listened to me! I've got good instincts! I know danger when I see it. Just like, I know love when I see it. Whoa!

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Thank you!

[ANNA, spoken]
Ah, that's not quite how I thought we'd end up

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
You've got to think things through in life, and... in love

[ANNA, spoken]
Touché

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Here. Grab on and brace yourself. Ready? Here we go!

[ANNA, spoken]
Whoa! Whoaa! Whoaaa!

(sung)
I'd like to point out that we've come a good long way here
And that you're–wow–really strong!

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
I lift a lot of ice

(sung)
You saved my life just now
I guess I gotta say here
My first impression was wrong

[ANNA, spoken]
And see? You're nice!

[KRISTOFF]
That jump was really brave

[ANNA]
Your catch was quite a save

[KRISTOFF]
You've got some guts!

[ANNA]
You've got some brains!

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Thanks

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
With miles and miles to go
I guess it's nice to know
That I can trust you
Though the question still remains...
What do you know about love?

[KRISTOFF, spoken]
Just, be careful

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
What do you know about love?

[ANNA, spoken]
Have a little faith

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
At least we know one thing:
This trip should be interesting!

What do you know about love?
What do you know about love?1Embed
