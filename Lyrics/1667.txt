If This is Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a long day and I'm trying to figure it out
The way those words left your mouth
I feel broken, shattered and blue
And it's all because of you
And I'm trying, trying to figure it out

[Chorus]
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?
[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since I've felt the way that I do now
Like I need you but I don't know how
It's been a while since I smiled
And I meant it for all my heart
But the idea of leaving this behind, it tears me apart

[Chorus]
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?

[Bridge]
Kiss me now and remind me why
I ever wanted to make you mine
And even though it hurts in this moment
I've always known it
You're the other half of my broken heart

[Chorus]
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?
If this is love
Why does it break me down?
Why do you break me down?
You might also like[Outro]
Even though it hurts in this moment
I've always known it
You're the other half of my broken heart4Embed
