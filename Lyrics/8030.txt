Youâ€™re Gonna Love Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a chance on a broken heart
Cause we're starting again
We gotta try even if it's hard
Try and understand
To find the rainbow in every storm
You gotta believe
Don't ever doubt that you do belong now
Cause it started with you and started with me

[Chorus]
Hearts run right 'til the end
And you're gonna love
You're gonna love again
And you're gonna love
You're gonna love again
[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna love, you're gonna love
You're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love
You're gonna love again

[Verse 2]
Everybody has their fears
Everybody has their fight
But don't you let it bring you down
No, don't you let it take your light
Cause you can turn this night around
Make it what you want it to be
If you're listening to me now
Set your inner spirit free

[Chorus]
Hearts run right 'til the end
People, come on
You don't need to be scared
Cause you're gonna love
You're gonna love again

[Post-Chorus]
And you're gonna love
You're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love
You're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love
You're gonna love againYou might also likeEmbed
