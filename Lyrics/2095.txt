Year 3000 Lyrics[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah
[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, oh

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000" (Yeah, yeah)
"Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"13Embed
