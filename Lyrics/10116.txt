â€‹fomo Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't follows fighting for a lost cause
Feel like even drifting, we're just off course

[Chorus]
Or is it no good?
What are we if dying for?
What are we lying for, oh, if it's no good?
Good, what would you call it?
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Mind if I don't end this dying (I don't follows fighting for a lost cause)
If it's worth it, you would know (Feel like even drifting, we're just off course)

[Verse 3]
Oh, it stops, all the faking, it's all fire
No flame can absolve sin
Oh, it's nothing
I'll get sullen, when I get sober
Despite my best, you keep calling


[Outro]
You got something I don't want to miss out on
I don't leave you over your stead
Would you call that love?
Love
Love
Love, love
You call that love?
Love
Love, love
Would you call that love?
Love
Love, love
All that love
Love
Love, loveYou might also like2Embed
