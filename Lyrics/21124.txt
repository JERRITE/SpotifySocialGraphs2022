The Reason Why Lyrics[Intro: Stefflon Don, Banx & Ranx]
Uh, Don
Yeah, Banx & Ranx

[Verse 1: JP Cooper]
Oh I, I feel like I can be myself with you
All these feelings came out of the blue
I found love, I'm lost in your perfume
It takes me over

[Pre-Chorus: JP Cooper, Stefflon Don]
Oh, won't ya come closer
Your head on my shoulder (Eh)
Can't keep my composure (Nah)
Not gonna lie
[Chorus: JP Cooper, Stefflon Don]
Sugar, don't you know that you're the reason why
Why I get up in the morning
It's the sugar in your love and you're the reason why
I'm addicted to you, darling
We ain't even sleepin', we be up all night
Making love until the morning (Yeah)
Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why
The reason why
The reason why
The reason why
You're the reason why
