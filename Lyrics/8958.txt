Ride on a Pony LyricsBaby won't you tell me
What you're tryin' to do
You don't mean to say
That our love is through
Because i love you
Yes i do
And i've go to see it through
I lives on the mountain
A hundred mile from town
That's a long way to go
Baby now
But soon i'm gonna be around
Because i love you
Yes i do
And i've got to see it through
Baby now
I'm gonna steal you baby away with me
I want to love you
Because you see
I am riding on a pony
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna be there in the morning
And i hope that it's all right
Sometimes when i am loney
I think about your face, baby
So i get on my pony
And i ride over your place
Because i love you
Yes i do
And i've go to see it through
I wanna take you, far away
I wanna love you, no matter what you say
Because i am riding on a pony
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna be there in the morning
And i hope that it's all right
I am riding on a pony
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna be there in the morning
And i hope that it's all right
I am riding on a pony
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna be there in the morning
And i hope that it's all rightYou might also likeEmbed
