One Hook LyricsHook:
(Look) i hope what we talking is money
I can be a thousand miles away from you but i'm never far from the money
Run, skip, even crawl to the money
Im just trying to have a ball with the money
Never ever get caught up in money
Loyalty will take you further than money
Remember times i had to borrow some money
Facetime had to call up the money
Instagram gotta follow the money
Can't sleep got me stalking the money
Bathroom never stalling the money
Remember times i took a lost with the money
Now i keep it n***a hogging the money
I'm just trying have all of the money (Fo real)
Verse:
God and my scale thats all i depend on
Gotta big load let me know when it hit the endzone
When you broke and down bad b****** put you in the friend zone
Now i'm balling Jim Jones
I was just worth 6 zones
Yea i been gone
But i'm back feeling like i'm Jay-z
Been outta town hustling ever since i was 18
I'ma get this money i'ma get this money gotta stay free
Had to say it over put it in my head like its beigene
Remember all them nights out in concord i use to day dream
When i woke up n***a i was surrounded by straight fiends
Thats real talk i make money n***a i don't make scenes
Yea he act good but he police n***a like J Reed
Yea i'm short as hell but i can see the block like i'm KG
And i know it well i can beat the block like i'm Tay Keith
Its my money and i need it now like i'm JG
Talking Wentworth for what the s**t worth you gone pay me
Have my young n****s put the starch on you like straight jeans
Make you say please
First 48 n***a AE
I don't give a f**K who you get them p***y n****s ain't me
Cause they never there and i'm everywhere like fake lean
Got my brother lock like beanie sigel now he state p
Been 10 toes so long n***a got gangrene
N***as will kill you nowadays for alphabets beter take heed
What do frank mean
Take ya head for an AP
(S**t) i'm tryna stack now saving every penny like i'm JC
See that money clearer 20/20 vision like its HD
Had to do what i had to to sold a n***a fake weed
I ain't talking CBD talking bout straight leaves
I had to get him how it go
I had to juug him out his clothes
Duck duck goose any mini mining mo
And i'm ready for any amount of smokeYou might also likeEmbed
