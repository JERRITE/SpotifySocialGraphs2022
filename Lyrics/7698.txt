We Own the Night Lyrics[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

[Refrain: Tilian]
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
You'll forget I'm wrong
You might also like[Verse 2: Tilian]
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison, mitigate my pain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone
(Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow)
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I'm not barely hanging on
(Do it again, do it again, do it again, now grow)
And medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
Medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
(Do it again, do it again, do it again now)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate our aging faces18Embed
