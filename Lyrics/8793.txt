20th Century Boy Lyrics[Intro]
(Ow!)

[Verse 1]
Friends say it's fine, friends say its's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I move like a cat, charge like a ram
Sting like a bee, babe, I wanna be your man
(Hey!)

Well, it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your boy
Your 20th Century toy
[Verse 2]
Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good

Well, it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy
