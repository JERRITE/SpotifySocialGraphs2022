God Was Never on Your Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
If the stars fall down on me
And the sun refused to shine
Then may the shackles be undone
May all the old words cease to rhyme
If the sky turned into stone
It will matter not at all
For there is no heaven in the sky
Hell does not wait for our downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the voice of reason chime
Let the pious vanish for all time
God's face is hidden, all unseen
You can't ask Him what it all means
[Chorus]
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side

[Verse 2]
See ten thousand ministries
See the holy, righteous dogs
They claim to heal, but all they do is steal
Abuse your faith, cheat, and rob
If God is wise, why is He still
When these false prophets call Him friend?
Why is He silent? Is He blind?
Are we abandoned in the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the sword of reason shine
Let us be free of prayer and shrine
God's face is hidden, turned away
He never has a word to say

[Chorus]
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side
No, no, no

[Outro]
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Never, never, never, never
Never on your side
Never on your side
God was never on your side
Never on your side3Embed
