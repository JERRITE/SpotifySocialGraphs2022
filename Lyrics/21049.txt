The Good Life Lyrics[Intro: Matt Sharp]
Yeah, check me, woo

[Verse 1]
When I look in the mirror
I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude
Staring back at me?
Broken, beaten down, can't even get around
Without an old man cane, I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone (Woo)
[Verse 2]
Excuse the bitching
I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling
'Cause feeling is pain
As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

[Verse 3]
Screw this crap, I've had it (I've had it)
I ain't no Mr. Cool
I'm a pig, I'm a dog
So 'scuse me if I drool
I ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene
Just need to admit that I want sugar in my tea
(Hear me?) Hear me? I want sugar in my tea

And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

[Bridge]
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life

[Post-Chorus]
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back
I wanna go back11Embed
