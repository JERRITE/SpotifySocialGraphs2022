Beside You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Even though I'm tired
I waited for a while
I just want your skin against mine
Baby, once you show up
I ain't gotta say much
You know what I got on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit every inch of my heart like an overdose
I guess a shot in the dark ain't impossible
And now I'm wrapped in your arms, baby, hold me close
Don't you let me go, let me go
[Chorus]
Oh, I never thought this could be real
They don't know what I do
It's heaven right beside you
And they'll never know how good it feels
'Cause they don't feel what I do
How the hell'd I find you?

[Drop]
Oh, I never thought this could be real
They don't know what I do
It's heaven right beside you
And they'll never know how good it feels
'Cause they don't feel what I do
How the hell'd I find you?
It's heaven right beside you

[Verse 2]
Baby, have I told you?
That even when I'm sober
The thought of you is getting me high, mmm
I'm caught up in the moment
It's hard to keep my focus
But you're the only thing on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit every inch of my heart like an overdose
I guess a shot in the dark ain't impossible
And now I'm wrapped in your arms, baby, hold me close
Don't you let me go, let me go
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, I never thought this could be real
They don't know what I do
It's heaven right beside you
And they'll never know how good it feels
'Cause they don't feel what I do
How the hell'd I find you?

[Drop]
It's heaven right beside
It's heaven right beside
It's heaven right beside

[Bridge]
Like an overdose
It's heaven right beside
Don't you let me go, let me go

[Chorus]
Oh, I never thought this could be real
They don't know what I do
It's heaven right beside you
And they'll never know how good it feels
'Cause they don't feel what I do
How the hell'd I find you?
[Outro]
It's heaven right beside
It's heaven right besideEmbed
