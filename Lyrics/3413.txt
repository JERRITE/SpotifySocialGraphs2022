No I in Team Lyrics[Intro]
Tell me where the cash at
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me where the...
Take, take it easy workin' 9 to 4
Yuh

[Chorus]
Tell me where the cash at, I been on the fast track
Shorty want my heart but I could never backtrack
I just wanna smash that, hit it then I pass back
Shorty want my heart, but, I could never backtrack
This is ain’t nothin' new, I been chasing dreams
She been playing games, but there ain't no I team
I stay with my crew, girl that’s all I need
She been playing games, but there ain't no I in team
[Verse 1]
It's just me, myself and squad
I been going hard
She told me to slow it down
I take it too far
Searching for a check
Searching for some luck
Used to look for love
Now I barely find a fuck
Used to catch them feelings aye
Now I'm catching planes
I just want the billies aye
I won't ever change
Woke up in the hillies ya
Red dots on my phone
If it ain't 'bout money then
Bitch leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don’t wanna die too young
But I been livin’ life too fast
And she just want all my love
But I know that it never lasts

[Chorus]
So tell me where the cash at, I been on a fast track
Shorty want my heart but I could never back track
I just wanna smash that, hit it then I pass back
Shorty want my heart, but, I could never back track
This ain't nothin’ new, I been chasing dreams
She been playing games, but there ain't no I team
Yeah, I stay with my crew, girl that's all I need
She been playing games, but there ain't no I in team

No there ain’t no I in team girl, team girl
No designer on my feet girl, feet girl
I'm tryna pull up in that new whip, that new whip
Check the socks I'm on my rhude shit, my rhude shit
And I just hit my new thang
She always on a trip
She just wanna do thangs
I just wanna sip
Shorty got a body
But she don't ever flex
I know she a good girl
But I don't need the stress naw

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna die too young
But I been livin' life too fast
And she just want all my love
But I know that it never lasts

[Chorus]
So tell me where the cash at, I been on a fast track
Shorty want my heart but I could never back track
I just wanna smash that, hit it then I pass back
Shorty want my heart, but, I could never back track
This ain't nothin' new, I been chasing dreams
She been playing games, but there ain't no I team
Yeah, I stay with my crew, girl that's all I need
She been playing games, but there ain't no I in team7Embed
