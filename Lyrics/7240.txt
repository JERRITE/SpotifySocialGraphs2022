Go Hard or Go Home Lyrics[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Family, family, fam-fam-family
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family

E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
For the family
E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
All for the family
Family, family, fam-fam-family

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for
Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure made me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the mula
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family
[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
For the family
E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
All for the family
Family, family, fam-fam-family (Switched it up)

[Bridge]
All, a-a-all for the, for the, for the
All, a-a-a-a, for the family
All, a-a-all for the, for the, for the
Family, family, a-a, for the, a-a

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
For the family
E-e-ey, e-e-ey, e-e-ey
All for the family
