Think of The LOX Lyrics[Verse 1: Styles P]
If the love don't work, what would money do?
I'ma need that G pickup truck colored honey dew (Wooh)
Cantaloupe-colored interior
Whoever act superior, we'll pop 'em with the .22 (Well, hah)
Have a car and a condo at 22 (Facts)
Bird on the birds comin' up route 22
Ain't a cup of liquor, but niggas know he's a hundred proof (Hey now)
Cut the legs off of niggas sayin' they run with you
I'm a pothead, the cool homie to vibe with
Violate, you oughta bring a homie to die with (You oughta)
I'll blow an eight, think of steaks that I could buy in
Cop an estate, think of weight that I could fly in
Can you hear me now like Verizon
King of New York, bang your head right on the hydrant
Pops always told me to think out the box
So when you think about the best, nigga, think of The Lox
[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
(Flygod)
Ayo, half a mill on the neck, got 'em big mad
You think you takin' the shit, you gettin' shit back
Blew two hundred, got the coupe all red
The real locked up and the best all dead
That's facts, 30+ clips and that's that
I aim for the body, but I hit all that
These rap niggas ain't real
Shoot out the Cullinan, one hand on the wheel

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yo, laid it on the toy like a B-boy
Park the whip, make my son come downstairs and watch Bruce Leroy
Last dragon, pants saggin', nigga, don don's here
I'm out for the season and I ain't have Achilles' tear
I'm [?] Shakira got the window seat
I light something and go dumb on a Large Pro beat
Who fuckin' with us? I only use a fifth of my brain (Uh-huh)
And I'm still better than them niggas tryna be Wayne
I move the 'caine like a blind man
I'm caked out without a million+ Soundscan (Facts)
My skin lookin' like I found a youth fountain (Look at me, baby)
And jumped in it
Got the red Louis duffle with the fuckin' pump in it (Shit)
White wraiths, space you could put clump in it (Uh-huh)
Passin' the graveyard, I could see Trump in it (Damn)
Mama always told me to think out the box
So when you think about the best, nigga, think of The Lox
You might also like[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
(Flygod)
Ayo, half a mill on the neck, got 'em big mad
You think you takin' the shit, you gettin' shit back
Blew two hundred, got the coupe all red
The real locked up and the best all dead
That's facts, 30+ clips and that's that
I aim for the body, but I hit all that
These rap niggas ain't real
Shoot out the Cullinan, one hand on the wheel

[Verse 3: Benny The Butcher]
Yo
Ridin' through them blocks in all foreigns like a baby chariots
Had to run it up or these niggas won't take me serious
Real life street shit, niggas know how I carry it
She can't sit on this leather interior on her period (Nah)
About the get the coupe with the gun slide in the rear of it
The 2022 like I forgot what year it is
Wanted it, I went and got it, now I'm sharin' it (Uh-huh)
Toss the money bags in the closet, I built the pyramids (I did)
I took my respect living off experience
Stories about my hood got me living all luxurious
Racks on racks, stacked right in the closet
Need another stash house, I might get one in Yonkers, I did
Look how I benefited from them losses (From them losses)
Paying back connects, I'm paying all 'em lawyers
Got work if you niggas can't afford you a verse
Still make my bitch ride with the joint in her purse
[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
(Flygod)
Ayo, half a mill on the neck, got 'em big mad
You think you takin' the shit, you gettin' shit back
Blew two hundred, got the coupe all red
The real locked up and the best all dead
That's facts, 30+ clips and that's that
I aim for the body, but I hit all that
These rap niggas ain't real
Shoot out the Cullinan, one hand on the wheel

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I've been gettin' money so you know I want more
I'm live at the barbecue lookin' at the front door
I got the glow like I just came home from off tour
Got the plane jane AP on, offshore
Skybox, doing what the owner would do (What's up?)
Couple hundred mill over a Corona or two
Every day I face off with the zone or the glue
And spend the old paper up, and pay [?] the new (Fresh)
First we gon' beat the odds then we even it up (What's up?)
No ice on, rabbit ears, leavin' 'em stuck (Woo)
Ask me, they was better off leavin' 'em tucked (Uh-huh)
There's four pipes on everything, even on trucks (That's right)
In the foreign listenin' to Lauryn
The joint about Zion,  and these niggas is lyin'
Put hands on 'em and sneakdissin' to stop
So when you thinkin' of the best, nigga, think of The Lox

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
(Flygod)
Ayo, half a mill on the neck, got 'em big mad
You think you takin' the shit, you gettin' shit back
Blew two hundred, got the coupe all red
The real locked up and the best all dead
That's facts, 30+ clips and that's that
I aim for the body, but I hit all that
These rap niggas ain't real
Shoot out the Cullinan, one hand on the wheelEmbed
