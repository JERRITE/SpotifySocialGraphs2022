I Cannot Settle Down LyricsSomewhere in this lonely world
There is a place where I belong
And I have seen its fields and streams
They have been revealed in my dreams

But you see I cannot settle down
There's just too much left unfound
I keep drifting like a cloud
On the wind, on the wind

Loved ones and friends lost along the way
I hope they have no ill words to say
'Cause I have cried so many tears
Leaving behind precious hearts throughout the years
'Cause you see I cannot settle down
There's just too much left unfound
I keep drifting like a cloud
On the wind, on the wind

I must keep traveling on
To find the place where I belong
And if I travel 'til the day I die
I'll make my home somewhere far beyond the sky

'Cause you see I cannot settle down
There's just too much left unfound
I keep drifting like a cloud
On the wind, on the wind

And you see I cannot settle down
There's just too much left unfound
I keep drifting like a cloud
On the wind, on the wind
On the wind, on the windYou might also likeEmbed
