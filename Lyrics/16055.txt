TranslationsEspa√±olThe Boys Are Back Lyrics[Verse 1: Troy & Chad]
Take it back to the place where you know it all began
We could be anything we wanna be
You can tell by the noise that the boys are back again
Together, makin' history

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Troy & Chad]
It's time to show how
To be a superhero
Just like a showdown
Will Smith and Bobby De Niro
We're the best, no doubt
Doin' it like we used to do
This is our town
And I'm tellin' you, oh
[Chorus: Troy & Chad]
The boys are back (Hey)
The boys are back (That's right)
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood
The boys are back (Yeah)
The boys are back (Alright)
Climbin' up the walls anytime we want
The word is out, the boys are back
The boys are back
Back to save the day
The boys are back, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Troy & Chad]
Keep comin' with the right, win the fight every single time
Undefeated here in our house, yeah
We can rock, we can shock anytime we like
And tonight, we're goin' all out

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Troy & Chad]
It's time to show how
To be a superhero
Just like a showdown
Keep the pedal to the metal, go
We're the best, no doubt
Doin' it like we used to do
This is our town
And I'm tellin' you, oh (Look out)

To solve the mystery, fight the battle, save the girl
