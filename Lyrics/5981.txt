Virginia (Wind In The Night) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Virginia don't sound like she used to
Walking home late
Smoke in my lungs and whiskey burning
In my veins
December won't be so forgiving
I'm haunted by a ghost
Of you and my past colliding
I can never go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Wind in the night
Wind in the night
Thought that I heard you laughing
Wasn't that you, my darling?
[Chorus]
Virginia don't sound like she used to
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, baby
Virginia don't sound like she used to
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've travelled all over in my life
But nothing's slowed me down
This place that I used to love
Well, it's just another town

[Pre-Chorus]
Wind in the night
The wind in the night
Remember I caught you dancing alone in that first apartment

[Chorus]
(Wind in the night)
Virginia don't sound like she used to
(The wind in the night)
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, baby
(Wind in the night)
Virginia don't sound like she used to
(The wind in the night)
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, yeah

(I can feel a heart beating for me, baby)
(I know her heart's beating for me, yeah)
Virginia don't sound like she used to
Virginia don't feel like she used to
I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
Another heart beating for me, yeah

[Chorus]
(Wind in the night)
Virginia don't sound like she used to
(The wind in the night)
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, yeah
(Wind in the night)
Virginia don't sound like she used to
(The wind in the night)
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, yeah

[Outro]
Wind in the night
The wind in the night
Wind in the night
The wind in the night1Embed
