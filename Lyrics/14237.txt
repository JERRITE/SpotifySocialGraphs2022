Unattainable Lyrics[Verse 1]
Only when the goal is unattainable
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
Is buried down deep with the rest

[Chorus]
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy, lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead
[Verse 2]
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Beyond the rough where not as much is good enough
Oh, if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
I will be waiting here with open arms

[Chorus]
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy, lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved insteadYou might also like2Embed
