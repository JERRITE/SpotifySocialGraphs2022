A Dream With A Baseball Player Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw you last night in my dream
That's still the closest you and I have been
That's kind of sad, don't you think?
I think so

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know
[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to ever be with him
When he and I don't speak the same language?
But we have conversations in my head

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 3]
There's so much going on
My grandmother's dead
And I can't sleep 'cause this isn't my bed
He doesn't even know those things exist

[Chorus]
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 4]
I could just meet him and get it over
Or I'll just keep wearing his name on my shirt
Whatever I need just to help me cope

How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?
How did I fall in love with someone
I don't know?Embed
