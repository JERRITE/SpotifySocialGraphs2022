Ainâ€™t Life Grand Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watchin' people roll by
Wonderin' where they're goin'
Hey, what's your job?
What are you knowin'?

[Verse 2]
Drivin' to the grocery store
Pull my money out
Passin' by the liquor store
Throw my money down
[Chorus]
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grand

[Verse 3]
My wife's got the blues
Now I've got them
Gonna bring her a kiss
Make those blues run

[Chorus]
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grand

[Verse 4]
Sun came out the other day
Through those dusty clouds
And in my mind I was a child
And it felt good

[Chorus]
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grand
Ain't life grandYou might also likeEmbed
