Lula, Iâ€™m Not Mad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your hands around his collar
An unworthy kiss and I wasn't bothered
Pretend I wanted a reason
To run out of reasons to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I lie and recover
My bed is a hospital
She said, "Are you okay?"
Well, I lie and recover
My bed is a hospital
[Chorus]
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet with you

[Verse 2]
And I try to get your attention
But it's deeply useless and frequently painful
Your shadow, classist, cold as rain
As it casts upon my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Recover
My bed is a hospital
She said, "Are you okay?"
Well, I lie and recover
My bed is a hospital

[Chorus]
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet with
You might also like[Refrain]
You (Hey)
You (Hey, hey)
You (Hey)
You (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet
Take all of my time
Take me for granted
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet with you

[Refrain]
You
You
Cut me up in a million pieces
On another planet with you

[Outro]
(Hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey)
