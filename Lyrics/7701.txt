Could This Be Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Max]
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling every day
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?
Stay up 'til late at night
Watch the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Jay]
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
[Chorus: Max]
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love? (Love, love)
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love? (Love, love)
Could this be love?

[Verse 2: Tom & Nathan]
Sat in bed, we're on the phone
Her voice is sweet, she doesn't know
Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?
Walk together through the night
Sky is clear, the stars are bright
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?

[Pre-Chorus: Jay & Max]
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
Let's take a chance on this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think you already know
You might also like[Chorus: Max]
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love? (Love, love)
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love? (Love, love)
Could this be love?

[Post-Chorus: Max & Nathan]
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love, love? Yeah)
Could this be love?

[Bridge: Max]
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling every day
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?

[Chorus: Max]
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love? (Love, love)
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love? (Love, love)
Could this be love?
[Post-Chorus: Max & Nathan]
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love, love? Yeah)
Could this be love?Embed
