I’m Just Feelin’ (Du Du Du) Lyrics[Intro]
Du du du, du du du
Du du du, du du du
Du du du, du du du
Du du, du du

[Verse 1]
Can't wait to get off my shift
To treat myself with that gift
My body says I don't need it
But fuck it, just wanna feel it
I wanna relive the dream
Where everyone knows 'bout me
Treat me like I'm the baddest of them all
[Pre-Chorus]
It's you (Oh yeah, yeah)
Light my world with colors, we don't need no others
'Cause with you
All I see is roses, wavin' in slow motion

[Chorus]
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du

[Drop]
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just (I'm just)

[Verse 2]
I wish that there was no end
For the show in my head
High up, up on the ceiling
Is where I found my heart beatin'
Trip along 405
People are passing by
No one can kill my vibe when I'm with you (No)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's you (Oh yeah, yeah)
Light my world with colors, we don't need no others
'Cause with you
All I see is roses, wavin' in slow motion

[Chorus]
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du (Oh yeah)
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du (Oh yeah)
Du-du, du-du
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du (I'm with you)
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm with you)
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm with you)

Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm with you)
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm with you)
Du-du, du-du, I'm just feelin'

[Bridge]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
But I just feel it when I feel it
Every night, every night, every night
Every night, every night, every night
I lose my mind to feel this rhythm

Du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du1Embed
