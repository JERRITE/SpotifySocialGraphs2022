[Verse 1: YBN Almighty Jay & YBN Nahmir]
I'm chasin' a bag, countin' guap, while you niggas on some broke shit (Bitch)
My brother stay strapped, pop any nigga on that ho shit (Grra)
Internet shooters, man, these niggas ain't gon' blow shit (They ain't gon' blow shit)
And you ain't my brother, so you can miss me with that bro shit (Ayy)
Niggas say you flippin' work, then I'm on that kick a door shit (On that kick a door shit)
Take a nigga down, get on that ground, get on that floor, bitch (Grra, pow, pow, pow)
Your broski, he a clown, bro, move around 'fore you get domed, bitch (Bro, move around, ayy)
Had to cut him off 'cause niggas snitchin' on that ho shit (These niggas hoes, ayy, ooh)
[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay & YBN Nahmir]
I'm 'bout the cheese and the guap, yo' bitch, she a thot, tryna take off her top (bitch, ooh)
My brother just burnt out the lot, had to go cop a foreign just to drop out the top (skrrt, ooh)
I gotta watch for the opps, put a drum in the Glock, that's a whole hunnid shots (grrah, ooh)
Niggas want beef with the gang, but the whole fuckin' time, they be tellin' the cops (ayy)
I'm up in traffic, know that my pistol be clappin', run up, you think that I'm lackin' (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
Bitch, I'm a savage, I ain't never run from shit, bitch, I be lettin' 'em have it (I'm high off Maverick, gang)
High off dope, no, I don't fuck with them average, you niggas not 'bout that action (grrah)
Slide down, if a nigga want smoke, you should've known that I'm packin' (ayy, bitch, ooh)

[Verse 3: YBN Almighty Jay & YBN Nahmir]
Bitch, I be high like a addict, Balenciaga, need to copy the fashion (bitch)
Shootin' up shit like the navy, illegal guns 'cause these hoes automatic (grrah, grrah)
How you want smoke with the gang, but you stay put up?
Nigga, you don't want static (you don't want static)
Rented the Lamb' for a week, let Nahmir drive it and he almost crashed it
You niggas copy (copy), you niggas dissin' for fame (fame), you niggas really be lame (grrah)
Pop off, If I catch you then Jay rubbin' off the paint (he rubbin' off that paint, bitch)
If I see you at that drive-thru, I might have a nice day (that's on my mama)
Bitch, this ain't no Mickey D's I turn yo' M into a K (grrah, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 4: YBN Almighty Jay & YBN Nahmir]
Bitch, I'm the man, my diamonds, they dance, yo' bitch on my dick like a fan (my diamonds, they dance)
I feel like Tay-K, I just did the race, 'cause I had to run up the bands (run up the bands)
My niggas' real shooters, so why would they fight? You know they not usin' no hands (nah)
Why niggas mad 'cause I tryna make it? That shit was just all in the plan (gang, all in the plan)
We ain't fuckin' with no Ford so I'm bringin' out that Porsche
Bitch, I'm probly in the Jeep and yet, that bitch ain't got no doors (skrrt)
Bitch, I'm speedin' in that 'Rari, know that label got a horse (it got a horse, bitch)
Leather print up in that bitch, so, yeah, I'm slayin' up them doors (ayy)

I'm not from the Chi' but I'm throwin' Ls 'cause niggas be lamer than a bitch (Niggas, they lame)
Chasin' a bag, not chasin' a bitch, blue hunnids like Lilo & Stitch
Don't fuck with new niggas, just me and my brothers 'cause I know how quick niggas switch (me and my brothers)
He talkin' that shit, two to three shells, split that boy's shit like a Twix (gang, gang)
When we pull up and hop out, these niggas run (these niggas run, ayy)
They be talkin' like, "Oh, shit, he got a gun" (ayy)
