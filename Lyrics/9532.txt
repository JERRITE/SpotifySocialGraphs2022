You’re Makin’ Me High Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (ooh, baby)
You're makin' me high (high, ooh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I want to be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, with you there beside me
All night, (ooh baby), doin' it again, and then again
(And then again, and then again)
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (ooh-yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (ooh, boy)
You're makin' me high (high, ooh-yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Bridge]
I wanna feel
Your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal
You roll, I lick, and we can go
Flying into ecstasy
Oh darling, you and me
Light my fire, blow my flame
Take me, take me
Take me away

[moaning/vocalizing]
And all I really want is moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, with you there beside me
All night, (ooh), doin' it again, and then again
(And then again, and then again)
Ooh baby, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (oh-yeah)
[Chorus]
Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (ooh, you know you're makin' me)
You're makin' me high (high)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (high, oh baby)

[Chorus]
Ooh, I get so high (ooh, oh-yeah)
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky (ah, touch the sky)
You make my temperature rise (you know you're makin' me)
You're makin' me high (you know you're makin' me high)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (high)8Embed
