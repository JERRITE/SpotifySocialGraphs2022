Let’s Find an Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
‪June's glowing red
Oh, strawberry moon
You're always coming back a little older
But it looks alright on you

[Verse 2]
Let's find an out
We'll start anew
With the headlights in your eyes
I see it all over you
[Verse 3]
Burn out when you want
Something that's lost belongs to you
If someone should pay for it
Well, I don't know who
