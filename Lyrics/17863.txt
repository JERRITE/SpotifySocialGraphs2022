Gettin Lit Lyrics[Intro: Lil Tjay]
(This is a Melo beat)
Yeah, I'm feeling lit
I put a three-five in the 'Wood, higher than a bitch, huh
Yeah, I'm feeling lit, ooh

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I'm feeling lit (Boom)
I put a three-five in the 'Wood, higher than a bitch (Bitch, yeah)
I put my whole hood on the map, I feel like the shit, huh (Shit, yeah)
I blew a half a ticket up in Izzy floodin' out the wrist, huh (Wrist, yeah)
I'm just young and I'm lit, nah, I'm just young and I'm lit, huh
Times change, I'm the wave, haters on the page tryna steal the drip now (Suck a dick)
I swear I done seen a lot, so I keep a Glock, I can't put the fifth down (Brrt, boom)
Nigga run up, he get hit down (Boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down (Boom, boom, boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down
[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
Talking 'bout drip, I'm fly as a bitch
See the foreigns on my feet now
Shawty want clout, like get off my dick
Why you all up on my piece now?
Swear I been up for twenty-four hours
Juggin', ain't no time to sleep now
Started off okay
I'm workin' real hard, that lil' youngin a beast now
I'ma keep dropping the heat
Took a few losses, but I'm on my feet now
Niggas weren't really for me
I wish I been saw the shit that I see now
I ain't with subbin' through tweets
See me in traffic, I'm shutting the streets down
Niggas better get off my meat
Eighty-three shooters, you don't wanna reach now
They see the babas is deep
Got in my Birkin, so I'm finna tweak now
I'm finna tweak now, I'm going dumb
Walk around, I keep a drum
I keep a drum, I'm tryna shoot it for fun
I'm from a block where you better know somebody that slide or you better not come
My little bro on the run
He getting low, blue and white catch him, he done
I got some drillers, they dumb
Take all they want, really living by the gun
Nigga, you ain't real, you a punk
I leave him slumped, leave a nigga looking junked
Throw a nigga in the trunk
Bitch, ain't no limit, told you this ain't what you want

I'm feeling lit (Boom)
I put a three-five in the 'Wood, higher than a bitch (Bitch, yeah)
I put my whole hood on the map, I feel like the shit, huh (Shit, yeah)
I blew a half a ticket up in Izzy floodin' out the wrist, huh (Wrist, yeah)
I'm just young and I'm lit, nah, I'm just young and I'm lit, huh
Times change, I'm the wave, haters on the page tryna steal the drip now (Suck a dick)
I swear I done seen a lot, so I keep a Glock, I can't put the fifth down (Brrt, boom)
Nigga run up, he get hit down (Boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down (Boom, boom, boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down

[Verse 2: Jay Gwuapo]
Too much money to be politickin'
Most of the niggas I'm beefin' with broke
If you get money, go invest in some guns
'Cause when we catch these niggas, shit ain't a joke
Bro just came home, he did a couple years
But still he be grippin' on it, tryna blow
They see us gettin' lit in every function
Opps in the party, then they gotta go
They on my dick
Tell them niggas if it's beef, we ain't duckin', we ain't layin' low
I'm with the shits
A hundred niggas with me, but I ain't worried, bitch, I got the pole
Roll me a spliff
I'm feeling high as shit, but bro, just keep on rolling up the dope
Empty the clip
Bro'll make a movie clip if these niggas wanna make a show
[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I'm feeling lit (Boom)
I put a three-five in the 'Wood, higher than a bitch (Bitch, yeah)
I put my whole hood on the map, I feel like the shit, huh (Shit, yeah)
I blew a half a ticket up in Izzy floodin' out the wrist, huh (Wrist, yeah)
I'm just young and I'm lit, nah, I'm just young and I'm lit, huh
Times change, I'm the wave, haters on the page tryna steal the drip now (Suck a dick)
I swear I done seen a lot, so I keep a Glock, I can't put the fifth down (Brrt, boom)
Nigga run up, he get hit down (Boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down (Boom, boom, boom)
We gunnin' more, so get down4Embed
