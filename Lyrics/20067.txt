Catastrophic Lyrics[Verse 1:Gizmo]
I'm a walking talking crisis
Fuck with me this a heist, bitch
Don't make me go ISIS
No saving any lives bitch
My presence catastrophic
Fuck my heart I lost it
Born in the toxins
Now I'm in the mosh pit

[Verse 2:Gizmo]
Wrist slit, my fists hit
Your fucking face make my blood spray
Simp shit, that diss shit
Come meet me put you in a body brace
Get chalked out, no talk now
Picking you apart like a hawk now
Funny how they hated I don't care your music barf now
It is
[Bridge 1:Saphir]
I got no reason to hide
I am the demon inside
I am haunting every single corner across your mind
I am the devil you find
Effective poisons of lie
Opaquing every single corner across your mind

[Bridge 2:Gizmo]
I'm a walking talking crisis
Fuck with me this a heist bitch
Don't make me go ISIS
No saving any lives bitch
My presence catastrophic
Fuck my heart I lost it
Born in the toxins
Now I'm in the mosh pit

[Closeup:Gizmo]
I'm a walking talking crisis
Fuck with me this a heist, bitch
Don't make me go ISIS
No saving any lives bitch
My presence catastrophic
Fuck my heart I lost it
Born in the toxins
Now I'm in the mosh pitYou might also likeEmbed
