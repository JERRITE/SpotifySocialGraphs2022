The Therapist Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the leather couch
Exorcizing demons
No keeping secrets
Pour a cup of coffee
A few more cigarettes
God only knows
The roads I've been down
Educate me now
Break me down
To the bits and pieces
[Pre-Chorus]
I need somebody to bring me
Back to life

[Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed

[Verse 2]
I've got my hands inside my pockets
But I've felt no change in years
I've got these broken mirrors
But they keep me here
I need a higher calling
To get me out of bed
But God only knows
The roads I've been down
Liberate me now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I need somebody to bring me
Back to life

[Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed

[Post-Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong, what's wrong

(Don't talk, just listen to us
Keep quiet on the couch and shut the fuck up, don't talk
Don't talk just listen to us
Keep quiet on the couch and shut the fuck up, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your problems
Let it out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me all your secrets
Get it out
I don't know why these monsters
Are trapped in my head
I keep trying to put them to bed
[Post-Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong, what's wrong
What's wrong, what's wrongEmbed
