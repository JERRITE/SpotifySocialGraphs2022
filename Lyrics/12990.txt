Riot Rhythm Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got a smart best friend, she's okay
Carve you out, start today
Rush the door, take your seats
Our little saints play for keeps

[Pre-Chorus]
Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Rhythm ride the lightning
It's not hell or heaven
Just like riot rhythm
[Chorus]
You gotta march

[Verse 2]
Because my best friend, she's okay
Carve you out all the way
Straight A kids like a treat
She stands up, takes the heat

[Pre-Chorus]
Dear heart, don't stop fighting
Rhythm ride the lightning
It's not hell or heaven
Just like riot rhythm

[Chorus]
You've gotta march
You've gotta march
