Make Me Yours Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lose ourselves in the great unknown
One more night, we ain't going home
'Cause when we love, we love to the bone
Can't do this alone

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is a little bit of you
And a little bit of me
And we can make history
All I need is a little bit of you
And a little bit of us
[Chorus]
So kiss me and make me yours, ooh
So kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yours
Just kiss me and make me yours
Just kiss me and make me--
Just kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yours

[Verse 2]
Tell me now which way we should go
There's no road that I won't follow
My wild young heart can't leave you alone
I need you to know

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is a little bit of you
And a little bit of me
And we can make history
All I need is a little bit of you
And a little bit of us

[Chorus]
So kiss me and make me yours, ooh
So kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yours
Just kiss me and make me--
Just kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yours, ooh
Just kiss me and make me yoursYou might also likeEmbed
