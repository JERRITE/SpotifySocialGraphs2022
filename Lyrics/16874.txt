Goodbye Love Lyrics[MIMI]
It’s true you sold your guitar
And bought a car?

[ROGER]
It’s true I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It’s true you're with this yuppy scum?

[BENNY]
You said you'd never speak to him again
[MIMI]
Not now

[MAUREEN]
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?

[ROGER]
Yeah!

[JOANNE]
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people’s-

[MAUREEN]
Who said I was talking to you?

[JOANNE]
We used to have this fight each night

[MARK]
Calm down!

[JOANNE]
She never admit I existed

[MARK]
Everyone, please!
You might also like[MIMI]
He was the same way it was always
Run away, hit the road, don’t commit, you're full of shit

[ROGER]
Mimi!

[JOANNE]
She’s in denial

[MIMI]
He’s in denial

[MARK]
Guys!

[JOANNE]
Didn’t give an inch when I gave a mile

[MIMI]
I gave a mile

[ROGER]
Gave a mile to who?

[MARK & BENNY]
C’mon guys, chill
[JOANNE & MIMI]
I’d be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had
Someone to live for
Unafraid to say “I love you”

[ROGER]
All your words are nice Mimi
But love's not a three way street
You’ll never share real love until you love yourself
I should know

[COLLINS]
You all said you’d be cool today
So please for my sake
I can’t believe he’s gone
And I can’t believe you’re going
I can’t believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can’t believe you disagree
I can’t believe this is goodbye

[MARK]
I hear, there are great restaurants out West

[ROGER]
Some of the best, how could she?

[MARK]
How could you let her go?

[ROGER]
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?

[MARK]
Maybe you'll see why
When you stop escaping your pain
At least now if you try
Angel's death won't be in vain

[ROGER]
His death is in vain

[MARK]
Are you insane? There's so much to care about
There's me, there's Mimi

[ROGER]
Mimi's got her baggage too

[MARK]
So do you

[ROGER]
Who are you to tell me what I know
What to do?

[MARK]
A friend

[ROGER]
But who Mark are you?
"Mark has got his work", they say
"Mark lives for his work and
Mark's in love with his work"
Mark hides in his work

[MARK]
From what?

[ROGER]
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact you live a lie
Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive

[MARK]
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive

[ROGER]
Poor baby

[MARK]
Mimi still loves Roger
Is Roger really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?

[ROGER]
Mimi did look pale

[MARK]
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time
Roger's running out the door

[ROGER]
No more, oh no, I've gotta go

[MARK]
Hey, for someone who's always been let down
Who's heading out of town?

[ROGER]
For someone who longs for a community of his own
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call
I hate the fall

You heard?

[MIMI (ROGER)]
Every word
You don't want baggage
Without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die
I just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love, came to say goodbye love
Goodbye
Just came to say
Goodbye love (Glory)
Goodbye love (one blaze of glory)
Goodbye love, goodbye (I have to find)
Please don't touch me, understand
I'm scared I need to go away

[MARK]
I know a place, a clinic

[BENNY]
A rehab?

[MIMI]
Maybe could you?

[BENNY]
I'll pay

[MIMI]
Goodbye love, goodbye love
Came to say goodbye love, goodbye
Just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love, goodbye love
Goodbye love, hello, disease3Embed
