Baby, I Need Your Loving Lyrics[Intro]
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Verse 1]
Baby, I need your loving (I really need you)
Baby, I need your loving (I really need you)
Although you're never near (I really need you)
Your voice I often hear (I really need you)
Another day, another night (I really need you)
I long to hold you tight (I really need you)
'Cause I'm so lonely
[Chorus]
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

[Verse 2]
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Then weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep

[Chorus]
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

[Bridge]
(Oooh) Empty nights echo your name
(Oooh) Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh) Will I ever be the same?
(Oooh) Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
When you see me smiling, you know (Baby, baby, I need you and I want you, baby)
Things have gotten worse (And I need you and I love you, baby)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby)
Has all been rehearsed (And I need you and I love you, baby)
Darling, I can't go on without you (And I need you and I want you, baby)
This emptiness won't let me live without you (And I need you and I love you, baby)
This loneliness inside me, darling (And I need you and I want you, baby)
Makes me feel half alive (And I need you and I...)

Got to have all your lovingEmbed
