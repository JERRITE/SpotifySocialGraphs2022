Portrait of a Female Lyrics[Intro]
I wish I don’t need you
I’ve been so deprived
Boy, when I’m with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

[Verse 1]
No Stockholm Syndrome
Full well you’re the devil
In disguise, feels right
Locked in your chains of love
Now I’m so miserable
When I'm free I just suffer
Too much, not enough
Locked in your chains
[Refrain]
It ain’t love if it don’t hurt
No safety word

[Chorus]
I wish I don’t need you
I’ve been so deprived
Boy, when I’m with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, hopefully
To the bedpost
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, unconditionally
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

[Verse 2]
Two hands cover my screams
Porno on the big screen
You ain’t shy, don’t lie
I’ll try anything twice
Hit me when you coming
Safe shit got you running
I ain’t her, I can learn
I’ll try anything
You might also like[Refrain]
It ain’t love if it don’t hurt
No safety word

[Chorus]
I wish I don’t need you
I’ve been so deprived
Boy, when I’m with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, hopefully
To the bedpost
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, unconditionally
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

[Outro]
And there’s nothing, nothing I can do
I ain’t deprived, I just wanna feel
You bring out the worst in me
And that ain’t how love’s supposed to be
And I ain’t disturbed, I just prefer
Let’s not pretend that we’re friends
I don’t care about your plans or how your day went
Just pin me up on the wall
Or the floor, or the bed, oh
There’s nothing I can do
All I want is to bring out the worst in you
All I want is to bring out the worst in you5Embed
