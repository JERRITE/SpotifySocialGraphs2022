Love Galaxy Lyrics[Intro]
Cosmic music

[Verse 1]
Go and turn the lights down in the boot now
Come roll with me
Way past Pluto, we on a route, though
With no gravity
Ooh, new planets, where have we vanished?
No [?]
Searching new places, these faces
A love galaxy
(Ooh, she's so) I got so much that I wanna show you
(Ooh, she's so) So much more that we can figure out
(Ooh) Ain't no better way to get to know you, to know you
Ain't no better time than now
[Pre-Chorus]
I never guessed I'd feel quite this incredible
If it's the final thing I'll ever do
Let us do some things unforgettable
Let's get it on and make new dreams come true

[Chorus]
Come with us if you want
Ride a rocket ship until your body gives up
This space and time is all we've got
We're gonna take it steady if you're ready or not
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, come with us, yeah
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, yeah, come with us

[Interlude]
Ooh, all we need, all we need, all we need
All we need's love (Love)
Ooh, all we need, all we need, all we need
All we need is love (Love)

[Pre-Chorus]
I never guessed I'd feel quite this incredible
If it's the final thing I'll ever do
Let us do some things unforgettable
Let's get it on and make new dreams come true
You might also like[Chorus]
Come with us if you want
Ride a rocket ship until your body gives up
This space and time is all we've got
We're gonna take it steady if you're ready or not
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, come with us, yeah
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, yeah, come with us

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
She said the beam from the skylights is so enticing (So enticing)
She reaching for the sky like Peabo Bryson
For a piece of the pie (For the pie), toast to the high life
And cake so sweet, it don't need no icing (Don't need no icing)
Well damn, girl, them dreams so lofty
You trying to hit pure D cream, no coffee (No coffee)
Well, I feel you, whatever don't kill you
I'll break a bitch down, we'll make a bitch realer

[Chorus]
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, come with us, yeah
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, yeah, come with us
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, come with us, yeah
Come with us, come with us
Come with us, yeah, come with us
[Outro]
Come with us, yeah
Come with us, yeah
Come with us, yeah
Come with us, yeahEmbed
