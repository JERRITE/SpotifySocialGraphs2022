Hear Me Say Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
All the late night conversations
Way too many hesitations
Feel the doubt, I feel the doubt
And the memories, I've been savin'
But the good ones, they're all fadin'
Fadin' out, they're fadin' out
And I hear you callin' out my name
Oh, we can't go back and that's a shame
[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could tell you there's no one to blame
Wish I could tell you I still feel the same
I want you to know, know, that it was never in vain
And that's the last thing that you'll hear, you'll hear me say

[Chorus]
Last thing that you'll, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, you, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, you, last thing that you'll hear

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Last thing that you'll hear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wish I could tell you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Last thing that you'll hear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It'll be the last thing, last thing

[Verse 2]
All the ways I tried to reach you
Told myself that I still need you
How I used to, the way I used to
And I know just what you're sayin'
But the words don't mean the same thing anymore
Oh, anymore
I hear you callin' out my name
Oh, we can't go back and that's a shame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could tell you there's no one to blame
Wish I could tell you I still feel the same
I want you to know, know, that it was never in vain
And that's the last thing that you'll hear, you'll hear me say

[Chorus]
Last thing that you'll, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, you, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, last thing that you'll hear
Last thing that you'll, you, last thing that you'll hear

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Last thing that you'll hear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wish I could tell you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Last thing that you'll hear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's the last thing, last thing

[Bridge]
But I wish I could tell you there's no one to blame
Wish I could tell you I still feel the same
I want you to know, know, that it was never in vain
And that's the last thing that you'll hear
Oh, it's the last thing that you'll hear
[Outro]
You'll hear me say, you'll hear me say
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Last thing that you'll hear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You'll hear me sayEmbed
