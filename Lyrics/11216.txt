My Sentimental Friend LyricsOn the floor, the people dance around
Moving close together
But there all alone in the corner
There's the girl I once knew
Who broke me in two

So won't you please play a song
A sentimental song
For my sentimental friend over there?
We've been so long apart
Make it go right to the heart
Of my sentimental friend over there
Bring the tears to her eyes
Help to make her realize
The love we had was just beyond compare
Then if the time is right
Maybe I'll hold her tight
My sentimental friend over there

I recall the way she used to feel
When we heard a sad song
The teardrops would fall
And she'd hold me
And tell me
She'd be forever with me

So won't you please play a song
A sentimental song
For my sentimental friend over there?
We've been so long apart
Make it go right to the heart
Of my sentimental friend over there

Bring the tears to her eyes
Help to make her realize
The love we had was just beyond compare
Then if the time is right
Maybe I'll hold her tight
My sentimental friend over there

Bring the tears to her eyes
Help to make her realize
The love we had was just beyond compare
Then if the time is right
Maybe I'll hold her tight
My sentimental friend over there

So won't you please play a song
A sentimental song
For my sentimental friend over there?Embed
