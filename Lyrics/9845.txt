More Than Music Lyrics[Verse 1: Calo]
This is more than music, I can feel it
And I'm readin' out people like Dr. Phil, and
Everybody hate, 'cause I just kill it
I'm the center of the stage;
Y'all just villains
I'm a G, I'm a G; don't get it twisted;
Believe Imma see all the dreams I wished of;
Checks in my checking account;
Why I be flexin' 'em out
Got stacks
You got opinion, no facts
Got you all runnin' in laps;
Squad full of generals
No room for soldiers;
They don't mess with us
But you know this
Swear Imma grab on this shit
And never lose grasp on this shit
Double XL, I will get;
Never gon' fail, I'm the King, yeah
Runnin' and runnin they follow my trail
Watchin' my moves, hopin' I bail
Hopin' I follow my dad
They hopin' I trip
Homie no, I am no kid
I be the shit
Walk in the party and leave with yo bitch
Uh, I leave with ya bitch, uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Now that's real shit, I shoot them bulletsYou might also like5Embed
