Lucky Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Fell asleep with my cigarette lit
Had a dream the house went up
All it did was burn through the sheets
Guess that I'm lucky enough
Came home and my house got robbed
Took my laptop and my stuff
Least my guitar was still there
Guess that I'm lucky enough
I'm lucky enough
[Verse 1]
To grab on that big o'l butt, just met her but I bet she cut
And I've been in this spot all night, bartender got me drunk
I've been off the Xans for days, my head's feelin' really light
I sleep all throughout the day and I'm awake all through the night
Least I got friends, but I miss my family, my mom and my sister, my grammy
My girl the best, she put up with me, she knows I'ma get me a Grammy
Walkin' down the boulevard steppin' on all the stars
That'll be me one day, the world is about to be ours

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with my cigarette lit
Had a dream the house went up
All it did was burn through the sheets
I guess that I'm lucky enough
Came home and my house got robbed
Took my laptop and my stuff
At least my guitar was still there
Guess that I'm lucky enough, I'm lucky enough

[Verse 2]
To rock out on that stage just booked a show, ooh this pays
I'ma get me into it, enough drinks here for the rage
Got a studio to make my songs
Got a card to swipe when I'm on
My homie know all these spots
All the spots with the baddest jawns
This life we live, this life is it
The way that we're headed we're bout to be rich
And even if not, we still got it locked
Still got a jacket, and still got the pot
Still got a heart, still got these dreams
Still made it all to fly with these wings
I'm lucky for y'all, I'm lucky for fame
I'm lucky I'm here this song is so free
I'm lucky enough
You might also like[Chorus]
I fell asleep with my cigarette lit
Had a dream the house went up
All it did was burn through the sheets
I guess that I'm lucky enough
Came home and my house got robbed
Took my laptop and my stuff
At least my guitar was still there
Guess that I'm lucky enough, I'm lucky enough

[Bridge]
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough
I'm lucky lucky they have not had enough of me
I'm lucky lucky left for a year but my people love me
I'm lucky lucky have all these angels above me
I'm lucky lucky left my girl but she still fuck me

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with my cigarette lit
Had a dream the house went up
All it did was burn through the sheets
I guess that I'm lucky enough
Came home and my house got robbed
Took my laptop and my stuff
At least my guitar was still there
Guess that I'm lucky enough, I'm lucky enough
I fell asleep with my cigarette lit
Had a dream the house went up
All it did was burn through the sheets
I guess that I'm lucky enough
Came home and my house got robbed
Took my laptop and my stuff
At least my guitar was still there
Guess that I'm lucky enough, I'm lucky enough3Embed
