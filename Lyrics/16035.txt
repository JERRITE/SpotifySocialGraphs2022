Made Of Matches (TV Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Red nails, High heels
She's reckless with the hearts she steals
Spends money, She doesn't earn
And sets fires just to watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
That girl is made of matches
And she wants to light her name until it catches
Too close to be playin' around
So she's gonna burn herself to the ground
[Verse 2]
Cool as ice, but flammable
She's kept her pretty little hands full
Hasn't felt, The sacrifice
At the alter of burnin' your name in lights

[Chorus]
That girl is made of matches
And she wants to light her name until it catches
Too close to be playin' around
So she's gonna burn herself to the ground

[Bridge]
She likes the feel of ashes
Between her fingertips but her lungs are
Fillin' up with smoke

[Chorus]
That girl is made of matches
And she wants to light her name until it catches
Too close to be playing around
So she's gonna burn herself
That girl is made of matches
And she wants to light her name until it catches
Too close to be playing around
So she's gonna burn herself
