Still There for Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh darlin', my dear
Please let me hold you near
You've waited long time
While I made up my mind

[Chorus]
I can't believe
That you are still there for me

[Verse 2]
I stumbled; I fell
And now I'm here to tell you
I need you, right now
I'll stay and we'll work it out
[Chorus]
I can't believe
That you're still there for me

[Verse 3]
You kept on forgiving me. You gave me everything...
I know now, I'm sure
My heart has found a cure
I'm ready; I'm strong, but you knew that all along

[Chorus]
I can't believe
That you're still there for me

[Verse 4]
Oh darlin', my dear
Please let me hold you near
This is where I'm at
I'm going to learn how to love like that

[Outro]
I can't believe
That you're still there for me
I can't believe
That you're still there for meYou might also likeEmbed
