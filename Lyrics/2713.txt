Anyway Lyrics[Intro]
Blaq Tuxedo

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway, way, way
'Cause I'ma love you anyway, way, way

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I know you probably never had somebody
Lovin' you like I do, someone who's there for you
Don't judge ya 'cause I know we only human
I must be stupid, babe, lettin' you slip away
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Tayla Parx]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage and all, no need to hide

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Chris Brown, Tayla Parx, Chris Brown]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway
'Cause I'ma love you anyway (Hey!), way (Hey!), way (Hey!)
'Cause I'ma love you anyway, way, way

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I wish that you could see you like I see you
It's not that you're no good, you're just misunderstood
Now it's my job to make you a believer
Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Tayla Parx]
If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage and all, no need to hide

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Chris Brown, Chris Brown, Tayla Parx]
'Cause I'ma love you anyway (Oh, anyway, oh)
'Cause I'ma love you anyway (Oh, anyway)
'Cause I'ma love you anyway (Hey! Hey!), way (Hey! Hey! Oh, yeah), way (Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I'ma love you anyway, way, way
(I wanna love you, love you anyway, huh)
