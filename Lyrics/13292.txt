Posing in Bondage Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you tell I've been posing
This way alone for hours?
Waiting for your affection
Waiting for you
Done up and drunk
Done up and fixed on
All of the nights you turned away my touch

[Chorus]
Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage
Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage
[Verse 2]
When the world divides into two people
Those who have felt pain
And those who have yet to
And I can't unsee it
Although I would like to
Posing in bondage
I hope you come home soon

[Chorus]
Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage
Closeness
Proximity
I need it
