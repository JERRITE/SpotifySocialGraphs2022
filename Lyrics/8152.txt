Come and meet me where the lights are low

[Verse 1]
I'll keep it secret
Oh, my, my
I'll keep it hush if we do something dumb tonight
Too many reasons
Oh, my, my
We should know better
Not talk about sex, but
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop it
No, no, no
If I'm being honest
Woah-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

[Post-Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel thе same, feel the same
Put our hands in placеs we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

[Verse 2]
She said let's do this
Oh, my, my
A lil' less talking, a little more lips on mine
Let's get into it
Oh, my, my
Know I said let's not open end up in bed, but
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop it
No, no, no
If I'm being honest
Woah-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

[Post-Chorus]
I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Come and meet me where the lights are low
Come and meet me where the lights are lowEmbed
