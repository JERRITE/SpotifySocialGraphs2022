Girls Love Rod Wave Lyrics[Intro]
(LMC)
(SephGotTheWaves)

[Verse 1]
Back to back dates, girl, do you miss me when I'm gone?
Just been busy and alone
Times I wish you would just hit me, come along
Go get dressed and call me, "Baby, come and get me," hit the road
I can’t wait to make it home, get in my room, take off your clothes, yeah
I hope you get in your feelings to this song
It's a message for your heart, I just wanted you to listen when I'm gone
Heart cold, snowfalls make you shiver through the storm
Time froze, I been waiting all winter for your love
[Chorus]
Look, I know girls lovе Rod Wave, girls love to party
Girls love to drink, thеn they think, and they call me
That’s when we link and you tell me you sorry
I know it's easy to leave me the hard way
I come from the streets, I mean beepers and hallways
I know our love deep like the sea in the ark days
Stare at the ceiling while she listenin' to Rod Wave
Girls love listenin' to Rod Wave

[Verse 2]
She asked, "If you not ready for it, what you want my lovin' for?"
Seem like we never reach whatever we been runnin' towards
She think if she scream it, then her feelings goin' unignored
And when she found her last, she could get hundred more
Just wanna tell you that I heart you dearly
Like, can you hear me?
I wrote this on the plane, just wishin' you could get near me
Girl, you keep me sane, my heart had been feelin’ weary
Trauma in my brain, I’m hopin' that you could heal me
Lately, I been saved ’cause I was up in that field deep
I never change, I always give you the real me
You know the saying, you sow it, that's what you will reap
Heart feelin' strange, so broken that it could kill me

[Chorus]
Look, I know girls love Rod Wave, girls love to party
Girls love to drink, then they think, and they call me
That's when we link and you tell me you sorry
I know it’s easy to leave me the hard way
I come from the streets, I mean beepers and hallways
I know our love deep like the sea in the ark days
Stare at the ceiling while she listenin' to Rod Wave
Girls love listenin' to Rod WaveYou might also like9Embed
