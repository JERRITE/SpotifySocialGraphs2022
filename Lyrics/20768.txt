Do You Believe In Love LyricsAfter we have listened to
Everything there is left to say
Watching the intended reality
Slowly fade away
Why is all we desire
Taken from our hand
Every dream is drifting away
There is understanding
For every-one who has ears to hear
No more looking over your shoulder
For someone to appear
Maybe you should be looking
Right into His eyes
So say goodbye to someone elses lies
I've got to know
Do you believe in love
In all the things
You've searched the world to find
But know nothing of
Through the sun, through the fire and rain
There is One who won't desert you again
(There is One who'll never hurt you)
If you believe in love

Some days I get up in the morning
And I wish I wasn't there
Life seems so incredibly lonely
When no one seems to care
But I've found somewhere
Within this heart a friend for life
To hold me close till all my fears subside
I've got know

Do you believe in love
In all the things
You've searched the world to find
But know nothing of
Through the sun, through the fire and rain
There is One who won't desert you again
(There is One who'll never hurt you)
If you believe in love
You might also likeDon't you go, don't you go
Asking questions anymore
Don't you go, don't you go
Asking questions anymore
The answer lies waiting for you

Do you believe in love
In all the things
You've searched the world to find
But know nothing of
Through the sun, through the fire and rain
There is One who won't desert you again
(There is One who'll never hurt you)
If you believe in loveEmbed
