No Heroes LyricsThis is my culture
I do what I do
Two fingers to fashion
I am what I am
This is my culture
I do what I do
Two fingers to fashion
I am what I am

We the pretty young things
We are the fashion
We don't want no heroes
We don't want no heroes
We the generation
So sick of labels
We don't want no heroes
We don't want no heroes
We don't want no heroes

This is my culture
I do what I do
Two fingers to fashion
I am what I am
This is my culture
I do what I do
Two fingers to fashion
I am what I am

We the pretty young things
We are the fashion
We don't want no heroes
We don't want no heroes
We the generation
So sick of labels
We don't want no heroes
We don't want no heroes...You might also like1Embed
