Bound Lyrics[Intro]
Bound, bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love

[Verse 1]
You started with a mere hello
And then you learned her name
You notice her finer qualities
And the magic of her rare personality
[Chorus]
Bound, bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound, bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love

[Verse 2]
You ask what sign she is
And you find that you're compatible
You realize how fine she is
She's just what you've been looking for, I'm

[Chorus]
Bound, bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound, bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love

[Bridge]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo

Don't you try to resist (Bound)
'Cause you're bound (Bound)
Bound to fall in love
Won't you try it again 'cause you know you're bound (Bound, bound)
Bound to fall in love
Oh, don't you know that you're bound (Bound), bound
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love
Don't you say that again (Bound)9Embed
