TranslationsEspañolРусскийPortuguêsSupernatural Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro]
I'm shy, oh my God

[Chorus]
Take a chill pill, take a chill pill
Take a chill pill, take a chill pill
Take a chill pill, take a chill pill
Take a chill pill, take a chill pill
[Verse]
Bitch, I'm from 800 where we kill, kill
Walked out doing drill, drill, pop out like a pill, pill
Wake up in the mornin', spark a blunt and crack a damn seal
We ballin', bitch, I break the backboard, Shaquille O'Neal (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I been turnt like Timmy, we got Dracos with titties
We got kids runnin' 'round with semis, that ain't love, that's envy
Big Jurassic in your city, Bimmers, Benz, and Bentleys
Rollin' 'round, G-Wagon, lean go to my kidneys
Bitch, I'm a monster, bitch, I'm a goon
I cannot lose, bitch, I'm a winner
Diamonds, they dancin' on me like thе winter
I got the shells, no Mastеr Splinter
I got them bails, put the blick on my hitter
Put a cross on my nails, but I won't cross my niggas

[Segue]
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on, gang
[Part II]

[Intro]
On my gang (Woah)
On my gang (Nigga)
On my gang (On my), gang
On my gang
On my gang (Woah)
On my gang (Yeah)
On my gang

With the gang, I'm a rebel (On my gang)
I make treaties with the Devil (Devil)
I'm in space, don't need no shuttle (Bah)
Don't be scared, don't need no trouble (Haha)
I just downed this Hennessy, it got me seeing double (Gang)
Countin' chips, don't let the cookie crumble (Woah)
We-We keep blicks, got that bag and I won't ever fumble
Trippie vs. the whole damn game, it's like a Royal Rumble (Bah, woah)
Pussy boy got pushed out the whip, I watched 'em roll and tumble (Bitch)
Your bitch kissin' on my dick, look like she blowin' bubbles (Woah)
Yeah, you niggas Autobots, I'm a damn Gundam
Walk around this bitch like I'm the pops, now they mad I sonned 'em (Woah)
Summin' up the paychecks, I'ma get this cash (Cash)
Summon up that paycheck, I'ma get that bag (Woah)
Private flights to Berlin, I got jet lag
Niggas try to steal my shine and I jet pack
And I'm only goin' up from here like a jet pack
And your homie all rolled up in here
It's that good pack (It's that good shit)

[Outro]
Bitch, gang (Woah)
Woah (On my gang)12Embed
