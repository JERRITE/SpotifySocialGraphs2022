TranslationsPortuguêsDeutschDead Horse Lyrics[Intro]
Alright, it took me three days to send you this, but
Uh, sorry, I was in a depression
But I'm trying to come out of it now

[Verse 1]
Every morning I wake up
From a dream of you, holding me
Underwater (Is that a dream or a memory?)
Held my breath for a decade
Dyed my hair blue to match my lips
Cool of me to try (Pretty cool I'm still alive)
[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
A shitty never-ending song

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's good to be the bigger person
But I'm so small I can't compare
And after all, it's only fair, yeah
I got what I deserved, I was the other woman first
Other others on the line
But I kept trying to make it work

[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To your shitty little song

Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

[Bridge]
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
When I said goodbye, I hope you cried

[Chorus]
I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
To a silly little song
I said I beat it like a dead horse, I beat it like a drum
Oh, I stayed with you too long
Skipping like a record, but I sang along
And now you get another song

[Outro]
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
(Now you get another song)
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
(Now you get another song)9Embed
