Raining Sunshine Lyrics[Intro]
Sunshine, Sunshine
Raining
Sunshine

[Verse 1]
When you think the hope is gone
There's a place somewhere beyond
Take a chance and realize, it's right before
Your very eyes
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Leave the dark clouds far behind
And step outside, the weather's fine

[Chorus]
It's raining sunshine
It's raining sunshine
All over mankind
It's raining sunshine

As real as it can be
Believe in what you see
It's not just in your mind
It's raining sunshine

[Refrain]
Sunshine, sunshine, raining sunshine (raining sunshine)
Sunshine, sunshine, raining sunshine

[Verse 2]
Something's in the atmosphere
Don't be scared of what you fear
Look around, the storm has past
Just hurricanes of happiness

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Raise up your umbrella's high
And stand beneath, the clear blue sky (the clear blue sky)
You might also like[Chorus]
It's raining sunshine
It's raining sunshine
All over mankind
It's raining sunshine

As real as it can be
Believe in what you see
It's not just in your mind
It's raining sunshine

[Bridge]
You may wonder to explain
Rays of sunlight and drops of rain
Coming down from up above
Cloudy with a chance of love
Can't you feel it in the air?
Sweet sensations everywhere
Whatever the weather is in store
Bring it on cause i want more

[Refrain]
Sunshine, sunshine, raining sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, raining sunshine

[Chorus]
It's raining sunshine
It's raining sunshine
All over mankind
It's raining sunshine
As real as it can be
Believe in what you see
It's not just in your mind
It's raining sunshineEmbed
