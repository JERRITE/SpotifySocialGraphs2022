Time for Heroes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shoveled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed
Truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you, my love

[Verse 2]
But there's a rumour spreadin' nasty disease around town
You're caught around the houses with your trousers down
A headrush hid in the bush
You know I cherish you, my love
Oh, how I cherish you, my love
[Chorus]
Tell me, what can you want, now you've got it all?
The scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
Oh, Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

[Verse 3]
He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
Then it's all
It's all in my hands
And it's all up the walls

[Verse 4]
So the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
It's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
And I sighed and sunken with pride
Well, I passed myself down on my knees
Yes, I passed myself down on my knees

[Chorus]
Now tell me what can you want now you've got it all?
The scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean
You might also like[Verse 5]
It was a few or more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
And we'll die in the class we were born
Well, that's a class of our own, my love
A class of our own, my love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shoveled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed
Truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you, my love
Yeah, I cherish you, my love2Embed
