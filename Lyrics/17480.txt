Wake Up With You Lyrics[Hook 2x]

I wanna wake up with you, in the morning
Every single morning, in the morning
I wanna wake up with you, yeah, yeah
I wanna wake up with you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]

And I love to wake with you and I know it took a while
When I see you naked in that kitchen, damn you cook in style
And I love them mornings when we wake up and your roomie out
And I'm asking if she heard us and you flashing me that crooked smile
Like oh my goodness, you be giving me that good shit
If your girlfriend heard you screaming that's like advertising good dick
Tonight let's leave the doorway open
And then maybe she can join us, if she get mad then I'm just joking
But I'm having trouble separating sex from the emotion
Cause when it comes to fucking, I'm in love when you start moaning
The money's nothing to me, if you want it then you own it
And all I'm 'bout is now so let's get caught up in the moment
The night is young but we old souls
By the time I'm done you be swoll closed
No looking back, you got no regrets
You just looking back when I slow stroke
You got that shit I'm trynna fall asleep inside
So I see you when I open up my eyes
I'm trynna wake up with you
[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]


You don't tell me to slow it down but it just started hurting
This what you calling rough but baby I just started flirting
When I have that type of night with you that'll make you call in work
And the neighbors see a show so baby girl let's open all the curtains
Your body perfect even if it isn't flawless
You mad your chest is small but they so perky when you braless
What makes you special is them things you insecure about
I hit it hard enough that you forget the shit you worry 'bout
And I know you heard about me mama they just rumors though
You cum so hard you laughing, I love your sense of humor though
And we can do it fast or we can do it slow
We do it while you high or while we getting low
You knowing that I think you fly, I'ma hit in your clothes
You move them panties to the side with a little pose
You got that shit I'm trynna fall asleep inside
So I see you when I open up my eyes
I'm trynna wake up with you
