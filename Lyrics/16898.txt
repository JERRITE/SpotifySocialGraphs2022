Choose Lyrics[Verse 1: Jack Avery]
We're supposed to be together, you ain't thinkin' straight
I gotta place that we can go and ease your stress away
A couple times I came around and you was M.I.A
It's kinda hard to be in love when we're in different states

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
Feel some type of way
I ain't tryna play
You got options, I got options
But you're here with me
Spent some time away
Now I'm here to stay
Life ain't stoppin', girl, what's poppin'?
What's it gonna be?
[Chorus: Jonah Marais]
Choose, I'm just sayin', what you wanna do?
Choose, I just dropped down in your city too
Choose, let me put you onto something new
Choose, ain't no tellin' what we get into

[Post-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
I'm ju- I'm ju- I'm just sayin', choose (choose)
I'm ju- I'm ju- I'm just sayin', choose

[Verse 2: Zach Herron]
So what, you stayin' or comin'?
It shouldn't be a discussion
All of these girls, we runnin' around
And I still be cravin' your lovin'
Center stage, no bluffin'
Interstate we buzzin'
Touchdown, I'm takin' off
So what, you all or nothing?

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
Feel some type of way
I ain't tryna play
You got options, I got options
But you're here with me
Spent some time away
Now I'm here to stay
Life ain't stoppin', girl, what's poppin'?
What's it gonna be?
