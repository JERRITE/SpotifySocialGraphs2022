Stop Making This Hurt Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Daniel puts the kids to bed
And they're screaming, "Oh, the gods must be crazy"
Well, Jimmy's on the road tonight
She doesn't recognize her country
My father's in the room next door
Crying with his ma at sixty-five
Well, every time I close my eyes
I just see it written in big lights
You know what it says?
[Chorus]
"Stop making this hurt
And say goodbye like you mean it
Stop trying on this hurt
Just say goodbye like you mean it"
("Just say goodbye like you mean it")

[Verse 2]
My mama's in the house tonight
Tryin' to break free of New Jersey
While the kids are on the street
And they're cryin', "Let me live in my country"
But me and Ray, we got a dream and a car
We're like free as the night
So how come every time I take a drive
I just see it written on street signs?
And you know what it says?

[Chorus]
"Stop making this hurt
Say goodbye like you mean it
Stop trying on this hurt
Just say goodbye like you mean it"
("Just say goodbye like you mean it")

[Bridge]
But if we take the sadness
Out of Saturday night
I wonder what we'll be left with
Anything worth the fight?
I wanna run from the darkness
Wanna shout at the light
It's coming over me now
Two, three, four, five, oh God, we barely survived
You might also like[Chorus]
(Just say goodbye like you mean it)
Stop making this hurt
(Just say goodbye like you mean it)
Say goodbye like you mean it
(Just say goodbye like you mean it)
Stop making this hurt
(Say goodbye like you mean it)
(Just say goodbye like you mean it)
And say goodbye like you mean it
(Just say goodbye like you mean it)

[Outro]
Come on, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Stop making this hurt3Embed
