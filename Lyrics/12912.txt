Empire (Live) - Bonus Track LyricsTime has been merciful, time is on our side
Time surrounds us, for us time decides
The path you have chosen, we will not astray
The path have been set for us, we will obey

Hail to the words, our gods, we're your servants
Hail to our gods, our world, our guardians

Oh, our creators stand by our side
Lords, take our offerings
Show us your grace
And show us the way, the light
Hail to the words, our gods, we're your servants
Hail to our gods, our world, our guardians

Relieve us from our sorrow
Grant us eternal life
Our dreams belong to you
We are yours

Hail to the words, our gods, we're your servants
Hail to our gods, our world, our guardians

Time had been merciful, time were at our side
Time surrounded us, for us time decided...You might also likeEmbed
