Where the Night Goes LyricsI’m tired of thinking of something to say
When there’s something we’re not talking about
You run a million miles away
But you don't go very far

You go where the night goes
You go where the night goes

Nobody sees how the lights
Go on around you when you’re down
And while we’re waiting for the night
Your eyes go wide at the sound
While we’re blinded by the light
I can tell just what you’re thinking
The graveyard is full of people who would love to
Go out tonight

So we go where the night goes
We go where the night goes

And I know this is your line
But you're not here to sing it
I think my eyes are turning white
I will never learn to stop

I've nothing left but time
Nothing left but time
And that's what gets youYou might also likeEmbed
