TranslationsPortuguêsSmoke Slow Lyrics[Intro]
I know, but— haha
I love you so much

[Verse 1]
She asks for a light
As our secrets spill on the window sill
We're buying more time
While we kill ourselves as we both inhale

[Pre-Chorus]
Making believe there's a future
Is it naive to think we could work?
The second it's out, then I lose her
We're already here so one more won't hurt
It won't hurt
[Chorus]
But all that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waitin' at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So, take your time while you're mine
And smoke slow

[Verse 2]
Breakin' away
For the hell of it, started innocent
I'm tellin' you things that I've never said
Hope I don't regret this

[Pre-Chorus]
Making believe that we're clueless
One little spark that we won't put out
Makin' a million excuses
'Cause isn't it fun just for now?

[Chorus]
But all that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waitin' at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So, take your time while you're mine
And smoke slow
You might also like[Bridge]
Addicted to illusions of a love that never was
And never will be, anyway (Ah), ooh
The nicotine don't taste the same
If I'm not with you savorin' every breath we take
Play with fire, take me higher

[Chorus]
All that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waitin' at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So, take your time while you're mine
And smoke slow4Embed
