You Give Me Something (Refreshed) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You only stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water
But now I've gotten in too deep
For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart
[Verse 2]
You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've nеver bought you flowers
I can't work out what they mеan
I never thought that I'd love someone
That was someone else's dream

[Chorus 2]
As you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart

[Bridge]
But it might be a second too late
And the words that I could never say
Are gonna come out anyway

[Chorus 3]
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart
You might also like[Outro]
Know my heart
Know my heart
Know my heart
Know my heart, yeahEmbed
