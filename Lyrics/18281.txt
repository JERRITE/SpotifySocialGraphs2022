Cocaine Catwalk Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, easy, breezy ghetto bitch
Coke all in my pinky nail
Taser in my Telfar just in case I gotta give 'em hell
I don't want no problems
Leave the drama at ya mama house
Heard ya nigga actin' up
I guess it's time to kick him out
Legal reefer blowin' in the wind
High as fuck, I'm lookin' low
I left my nigga with his friends
It's a girl's night
I need pussy poppin' left and right
Fenty glitter, booty bigger
Make these bitches wanna fight
Tell Evanda she ain't gotta hate
Night is young, the goose is grey
Moon is new so celebrate
Don't compеte, collaborate
Hit my bundle, feel a rush
Pop a molly, gеt a crush
Now we good to go
I'm with my bitches on the dance flo'
Dance flo', yeah
[Chorus]
Wanna get beside you while you movin' on the dance flo'
Wanna get behind you when you movin' on the dance flo'
Wanna get to know you, won't you lead me on the dance flo'
Do a line and walk it off, I know you wanna dance
Boy you fuckin' with a

[Verse 2]
Easy, breezy ghetto bitch
Coke all in my pinky nail
Racks all in my Telfar just in case I gotta pay for bail
Lookin' like a snack, he gon' react and ion blame him
You can put him on a leash
But you ain't got the strength to tame him
Run his pockets though
Show you ain't no silly hoe
Tell him bbymutha taught you better
Ion go for broke
Leave him at the crib with all the kids
Spend the night with me
Thuggin' with the coven, extra lovin'
Secrets safe with me
Take a trip to Muthaland
You poppin', you get in for free
All my bitches extra bad
But come on, I mean, look at me
We gon' dance the night away
Smoke 'til it's a cloudy day
Leave our obligations and frustrations on the dance flo'
Dance flo', yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Wanna get beside you while you movin' on the dance flo'
Wanna get behind you when you movin' on the dance flo'
Wanna get to know you, won't you lead me on the dance flo'
Do a line and walk it off, I know you wanna dance, c'mon
Boy you fuckin' with a demon bitchEmbed
