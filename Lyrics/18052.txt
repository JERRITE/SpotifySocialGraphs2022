​bored&blind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Honestly, I'm kinda burned out
I've been waitin' so long
I guess I've just been watching your mouth
Try to form the words of a love song
And, honey, will you sing it for me?
Get it stuck inside my head
Cutting letters out of a magazine
I write myself a ransom love note instead

[Chorus]
Well, how many figures will it take
For you to bring me back my heart?
'Cause right now, it's sittin' in your basement
Hidden in the back with some stolen art
And, hey, Mona Lisa
While you're smiling, will you give him one for me?
'Cause I locked myself inside his coffin
And I was dumb еnough
To throw away the—
[Verse 2]
Well honestly, it's kinda my fault
I'vе been wastin' my time
But I would rather watch you from miles away
Than be a little closer and bored and blind
And when I'm lookin' at you
Everything disappears
And lovin' gets a little bit lonelier
But loneliness was never my biggest fear

[Chorus]
Well, how many figures will it take
For you to bring me back my heart?
'Cause right now, it's sittin' in your basement
Hidden in the back with some stolen art
And, hey, Mona Lisa
While you're smiling, will you give him one for me?
'Cause I locked myself inside his coffin
And I was dumb enough
To throw away the key
Yeah, throw away the key, hey

[Bridge]
Don't you wanna read my letter?
Maybe you'd like to know me better
Don't you wanna read my letter?
Maybe you'd like to know me better
Don't you wanna read my letter?
Maybe you'd like to know me better
Know me better, know me better
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, how many figures will it take
For you to bring me back my heart?
'Cause right now, it's sittin' in your basement
Hidden in the back with some stolen art
And, hey, Mona Lisa
While you're smiling, will you give him one for me?
'Cause I locked myself inside his coffin
And I was dumb enough
To throw away the key
Oh, throw away the key
Yeah

[Outro]
Don't you wanna read my letter? (Ooh-ooh)
Maybe you'd like to know me better
Don't you wanna read my letter? (Don't you wanna read)
Maybe you'd like to know me better
(Maybe you'd like to know me)
Don't you wanna read my letter? (Don't you wanna read my)
Maybe you'd like to know me better
(Maybe you'd like to know me better, know me better)
Maybe you'd like to know me—4Embed
