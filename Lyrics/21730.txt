Life Is A Rollercoaster (2020 Version) Lyrics(Hey, baby)
You really got my tail in a spin, yeah
(Hey, baby)
I don't even know where to begin, no
But baby, I got one thing I want you to know
Wherever you go, tell me 'cause I'm gonna go

We found love, oh, so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster, just gotta ride it
I need you, so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery, girl, let's get inside it
(Hey, baby)
You really got me flying tonight (flying tonight)
(Hey, sugar, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You almost got us punched in a fight
(That's all right)
But baby, you know the one thing I gotta know
Wherever you go, tell me 'cause I'm gonna show

We found love, oh, so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster, just gotta ride it
I need you, so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery, girl, let's get inside it

So listen
Can't you feel my heart (feel my heart)
Can't you feel my heart (feel my heart)
Can't you take my heart

We found love, oh, so don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster, just gotta ride it (all night long)
I need you, so stop hiding
Our love is a mystery, girl, let's get inside it

So don't fight it, fight it, fight it (na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it (na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it (na na na na na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight itYou might also likeEmbed
