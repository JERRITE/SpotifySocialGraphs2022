The Boom Boom Doll Lyrics[Verse]
Addicted to the syringe, rhinoplasty forever
Me and all my girls gettin' pumped up together
Seeking aesthetic perfection, disco balls and reflections
Diet pills and depression, I do it all for attention
My daddy loves my plastic
And I break him off like chapstick
Picture perfect, snap this
I'm late for anal practice
I got Claire's body glitter runnin' down my tits
All covered in cum, cocaine, and spit
If you don't know by now, then learn
R.I.P. to Pete Burns
[Chorus]
I'm the doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm a doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm a doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm the doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm the doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm a doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm a doll, the teen boom boom doll
I'm the doll, the teen boom boom dollYou might also likeEmbed
