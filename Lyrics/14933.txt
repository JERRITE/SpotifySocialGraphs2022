Pop Goes the Weapon LyricsWho's that knockin' on my door?
What ya tryin' to bother me for?
Don't want none of what you're sellin'
I know that you're rotten to the core
So my 44 mags, about to put one in your melon

[B-Real + Chuck D]
Last night one of my neighbors
Got held up for the paper
But the popos never came
They won't do you any favors
Say your prayers
So many layers
Some things will never change
Ha ha ha
This afternoon got caught up at a red light
In the line of sight
Of these motherfuckers from the other night
Seems like the right time
Pullin' out his life line
Anytime you threaten mine
Gonna be a fight, you see

See I'm numb just lookin'
For a reason for my finger
To be squeezin' on the trigger
Do another killin' season

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real + Chuck D]
One gun, two gun, three guns, four
So many guns keep on runnin' out the store

[Chorus]
Pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop, ha ha ha ha
Pop, pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop, ha ha ha

Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Ha ha ha

[B-Real + Chuck D]
Feelin' my soul leave my body
La dee da dee
Somebody got me
I don't even know his name
Started fightin' at a party
No karate
Hammers droppin'
But the popos never came

Lightheaded and I'm dizzy
My vision fuzzy
I get the feelin'
It's the end of the game
I'm on the television, talk of me, ask who was he
'Cause they don't love me
That's when the fuckin' popos came

[Chorus]
Pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop, ha ha ha ha
Pop, pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop, ha ha ha
Yeah, pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop goes the weapon
You better keep on steppin'
Pop, pop goes the weapon
Pop, pop, ha ha ha

Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that knockin' on my door?Embed
