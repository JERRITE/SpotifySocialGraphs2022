We’re Still Here LyricsAll of a sudden
You changed my mind
Pulled back the curtains
A little at a time

You were on a frequency
The perfect opposite of me
Though i never needed any proof
To trust the heart that beats inside of you

Only one thing really matters:
We’re still here. We’re still here
Against all odds, we’re still here. Still here
There is color deep within your eyes
A history that only you and i could write
There is pigment in your memory
The origins of our family tree
Though i never needed any proof
To know the heart that beats inside of you

Only one thing really matters:
We’re still here. We’re still here

Through the static
Through the ashes
We were brave
Through the perils
Of endless narrow escapes
We’re still here. We’re still hereYou might also likeEmbed
