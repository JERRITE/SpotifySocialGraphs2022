Hotel Apathy Lyrics[VERSE]
You always tell me about the time you spent on your own
You always said there's something in the way you dress at the hotel
All of the lights as you're cashing in your prize start to shine
You always said there's no way you could ever lose

[HOOK 1]
I don't have to understand
Everything that I see
I just want to understand
Hotel apathy
[VERSE]
You turn it off, things are starting to go wrong, burning out
All of the lights suddenly don't seem so bright at the hotel
You always said that you could never stand to lose

[HOOK 2]
I don't have to understand
Everything that I see
I just want to understand
Hotel apathy, hotel apathy

[HOOK 3]
I don't have to understand
Everything that I see
I just want to understand
Hotel apathy, hotel apathyYou might also like3Embed
