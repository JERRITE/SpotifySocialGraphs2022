Letter In a Suitcase Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don’t think that you’re to blame
My rules ain’t gonna change
And I haven’t changed for no one
For no one, ‘cause baby…

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain’t got the time to be your man tonight
But I got enough to make you feel right

[Chorus]
I pack my bag!
I got a letter in a suitcase
I got a honey with a new face
I’m like “yeah!”
To every little thing that you say
You know that I’m not la-la-listening!
[Verse 2]
I feel like I’m fighting myself
I’m still finding myself, I feel…
Don’t think that it’s too late
I’m holding too much weight
You need to wait for someone, for someone
But not me

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain’t got the time to be your man tonight (your man tonight)
But I got enough to make you feel right (to make you feel right)

[Chorus]
I pack my bag!
I got a lеtter in a suitcase
I got a honey with a nеw face
I’m like “yeah!”
To every little thing that you say
You know that I’m not la-la-listening!
Pack my bag!
I got a letter in a suitcase
I got a honey with a new face
I’m like “yeah!”
To every little thing that you say
You know that I’m not la-la-listening!

Half the time I see myself alone
Half the time I don’t
Half the time I wish you’d let me go
Half the time you won’t
Half the time I see myself alone
Half the time I don’t
Half the time I wish you’d let me go
Half the time you won’t

[Chorus]
I pack my bag!
I got a letter in a suitcase
I got a honey with a new face
I’m like “yeah!”
To every little thing that you say
You know that I’m not la-la-listening!
Pack my bag!
I got a letter in a suitcase
I got a honey with a new face
I’m like “yeah!”
To every little thing that you say
You know that I’m not la-la-listening!Embed
