Just Because Iâ€™m Drunk Lyrics[Chorus]
Just because I'm drunk don't mean you're right
I'm a hangin loose and you're wound up tight
I'm ready to fuck and you wantin to fight
Just because I'm drunk don't mean youre right

[Verse 1]
Come quittin time on a friday afternoon
I got my dollar in the box, crank out a whiskey drinkin tune
I'm having a life and telling some good lies
Twist one up, burn it down
Till we're all runnin counter clockwise
A friend in need is a friend indeed
You gotta finish what you started
That's two things that I know
So I had to do my part to find the bottom
Of that bottle mama don't you know
Or I woulda been home hours ago
[Chorus]
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right
I'm a hangin loose and you're wound up tight
I'm ready to fuck and you wantin to fight
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right

[Verse 2]
I finally found my slice of life
Took me down a road that I once travelled
Left me standin down at the crossroads
One short road home, the other it all comes unravelled
Now I'm standing back at your front door
Mother, open it up and let me come inside
Want to ask me a thousand goddamn questions
When I ain't got a goddamn thing to hide

[Chorus]
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right
I'm a hangin loose and you're wound up tight
I'm ready to fuck and you wantin to fight
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right

[Verse 3]
Now I'm standing back at your front door
Mother, open it up and let me come inside
Now don't start it off with all of your questions, no
Because I ain't got a goddamn thing to hide
You might also like[Chorus]
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right
I'm a hangin loose and you're wound up tight
I'm ready to fuck and you wantin to fight
Just because I'm drunk dont mean youre right
Don't mean you're right, hell no

[Outro]
(Oh, hell no, I'm always right)Embed
