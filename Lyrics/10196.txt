Sleep Tight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sleep tight
I'm on my way back and feeling kinda sad
’Cause you were the best thing I never knew I had
I'm out of streetlights, I better make tracks
'Cause mum expects me back
But you were the best thing I never knew I had

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh my god, I’ve done it again
I almost killed our friendship, and I sure hope it's worth it
And I got all this stuff boiling up
'Cause I got drunk and said too much
I'm running in circles, and now we're–
[Chorus]
In the back of your car, we're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this, I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans, and my heart started screaming
God knows I’ve missed– God knows I’ve missed this feeling
This feeling, this feeling
God knows I've missed this feeling

[Verse 2]
Sleep tight, I’m coming right back to you in double time
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew is mine
And it seems like I wanna rush things, I should just enjoy the ride
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh my god, I can't believe
Everything was working out for me
Well, I sure hope we’re worth it (We're worth it)
'Cause I said too much I can't take back
Sorry if you weren't expecting that
We go in circles, in circles, and we're–

[Chorus]
In the back of your car, we're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this, I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans, and my heart started screaming
God knows I've missed (Aah-aah) this feeling
You might also like[Bridge]
Sleep tight, I'm on my way back and feeling kinda sad
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew I had

[Chorus]
In the back of your car, we're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this, I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans, and my heart started screaming
God knows I've missed– God knows I've missed this feeling

[Outro]
This feeling, this feeling, this feeling
This feeling, this feeling, this feeling
This feeling, I've missed this feeling1Embed
