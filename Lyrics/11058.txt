Me and My Arrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me and my Arrow
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow

[Verse 2]
Me and my Arrow
Takin' the high road
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow
[Bridge]
And in the morning when I wake up
She may be gone, I don't know
And if we make up just to break up
I'll carry on, oh yes, I will

[Verse 3]
Me and my Arrow
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my Arrow

[Verse 4]
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow
Me and my Arrow

[Verse 5]
Me and my Arrow
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows
It's me and my ArrowYou might also likeEmbed
