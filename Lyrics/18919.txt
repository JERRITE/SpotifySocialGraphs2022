Mr Darkness Lyrics[Intro]
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Dear Mister Darkness, I write you again
I've been so lonely, I'm needing a friend
Everyone tells me you never reply
But I still try
My walls are covered with pictures of you
I fantasise that you are here in my room
Most days I wake up just wanting to die
But I still try
[Chorus]
I give you my heart but you don't do the same
You tear me apart with a smile on your face, your face
You don't even know my, you don't even know my name
(My name)

[Verse 2]
Dear Mister Darknеss, I write you again
This time to tell you, today is thе end
I even shed a little blood on the page
Now it's too late
Gave me my twisted dreams and purpose in life
Maybe I'll meet you somewhere up in the sky
I never thought that love could bring so much pain
I can't escape

[Chorus]
I give you my heart but you don't do the same
You tear me apart with a smile on your face, your face
You don't even know my, you don't even know my name
Oh yeah
You don't even know my, you don't even know my name

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah
Come on now

[Bridge]
And when you close your eyes at night, we'll be together
I'll be your shadow, yeah, you'll never get away, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I give you my heart but you don't do the same
You tear me apart with a smile on your face, your face
You don't even know my, you don't even know my name
Oh yeah
You don't even know my, you don't even know my name
My name, my name, oh yeah

[Outro]
You don't even know my name, you assholeEmbed
