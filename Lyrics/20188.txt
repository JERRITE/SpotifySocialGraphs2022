â€‹chemical veins Lyrics[Intro: Sample]
He wrote me
"Coming back to the Sheba ghost, I thought of Solomon's list
Of all those signs one is only to name to quicken the heart"

[Verse 1: Mitch & Mars]
I'm sorry that I always start shit
I'm sorry that I seem so heartless
Sorry I bled on the carpet
And sleep all day in your apartment
(Sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(Sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(Feels so empty now) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Sorry, I'm sorry
I feel so helpless now
I know you want someone I can't be
You'll always be someone I can't please
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[Chorus: Mitch & Mars]
Taste of these chemical veins
My intuition is lifted whenever I hit or sip it
I got it, I get it till I am forgetting my name
What's death but an option?
I'm shit like my posture
Feel like an imposter
Live life like a monster
Just sad that I lost her
Now drown in the pain
Of these chemical veins

[Verse 2: 93FEETOFSMOKE]
See you down the bottom of barrels I'm fishing in
Stomp me out, toss me like roaches into the wind
At night the devil start speaking
Sews hate in my heart till I'm heated
I pull on the seams just to breathe in
Still pushing down urges, still fiendin'
Float away
Into the clouds, created by bullets
Throw away
All of my feelings, my brain says they're useless
Feel like my friends think I'm stupid (I'm sorry)
Nothing got good I'm not clueless (I'm sorry)
Keep my eyes low in my hoodie (I'm sorry)
Intuition left me bloody (Ahh)

Taste of these chemical veins
My intuition is lifted whenever I hit or sip it
I got it, I get it till I am forgetting my name
What's death but an option?
I'm shit like my posture
Feel like an imposter
Live life like a monster
Just sad that I lost her
Now drown in the pain
Of these chemical veins
Taste of these chemical veins
My intuition is lifted whenever I hit or sip it
I got it, I get it till I am forgetting my name
What's death but an option?
I'm shit like my posture
Feel like an imposter
Live life like a monster
Just sad that I lost her
Now drown in the pain
Of these chemical veins
Taste of these chemical veins
My intuition is lifted whenever I hit or sip it
I got it, I get it till I am forgetting my name
What's death but an option?
I'm shit like my posture
Feel like an imposter
Live life like a monster
Just sad that I lost her
Now drown in the pain
