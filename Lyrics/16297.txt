Games People Play Lyrics[Intro]
Where do we go from here
Now that all of the children are growin' up?
And how do we spend our lives
If there's no one to lend us a hand?

[Verse]
I don't wanna live here no more
I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life
Quietly fading away
Ah
[Chorus]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say aren't alright
If I promised you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

[Post-Chorus]
Where do we go from here
Now that all of the children have grown up?
And how do we spend our time
Knowing nobody gives us a damn?

[Verse]
I don't wanna live here no more
I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life
Quietly fading away

[Chorus]
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

[Instrumental]

Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say aren't alright
If I promised you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night
Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe me?
Games people play in the middle of the night2Embed
