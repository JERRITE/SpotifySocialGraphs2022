Vlone Flex Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey
Ice cold, dog
Ayy

[Chorus]
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang
[Verse 1]
Remember old days sellin' candy on the train, ayy
We ain't had no money, all my brothers hit a stain
School next day had to cop a new jet, ayy
And they cut ya ass 'cause you're broke and don't get paid
And now we in a foreign in the freeway switchin' lanes
Top off flashin', shawties wanna know my name
New whip, mansion, smellin' just like Mary Jane
6, 19, you don't wanna play the game
Grew up from the bottom, now I'm tryna reach the top
Pockets used to be a low now I'm gettin' all this guap
Writin' letters to my guys free my niggas off the rock
Happy for the ones that's here 'cause that's all I really got

[Chorus]
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang

[Verse 2]
Lamborghini switch the whip
Bugatti rollin' down the strip
Pull up and I'm movin' swift
Got in the booth and then got rich
You ain't even my shawty, why you trippin' on me?
When I pull up on your strip, you know know I'mma OG
All white on me, Vlone with the big V
Off-White on me, Vlone all on my tee
I remember I was broke, trappin' on the low-key
How you asking me for money? Why you think you so sweet?
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Got a big vest and inside I got the TEC
Don' my opp, I'm just tryna chase a check
I just got a hundred mil 'bout to go cop the wraith

Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang
Vlone on my body, I pull up and then I flex, ayy
Ice cold wrist, diamonds holdin' down my neck, ayy
Fake niggas see through, you could call it x-ray
Real niggas stay true, I call that my gang, gang6Embed
