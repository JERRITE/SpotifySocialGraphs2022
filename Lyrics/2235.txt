Homerun Hitter Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I'm gonna say it like it is
We've become identical to them
We've become the strangers we don't know
A dying rose
I'm forty miles North of where we met
You're forty miles South of where we live
It doesn't matter where we try to go
If all the exits are closed

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing I could say
To keep my head above the water
There's nothing I could do
If I lose one, I lose two
[Chorus]
'Cause I thought you were the Homerun Hitter, the cherry that never bitters
Like the first taste of heat, the feeling I want to keep until I'm dead (Dead, dead)
There's nothing I could do (Do, do)
And I thought you were a Cold Blood Assassin, a  truth I couldn't imagine
But that light never painted the room
Now there's nothing I could do (Do, do)
To make it easier on you

[Verse 2]
It's more than just the fire going out
It's more than just the candles on the ground
It's everything you wanted us to be
The parts I won't see
The door I always locked, you left it open
Too afraid that you would blink and it would close-in
And we would lose our vulnerability
Oh, we were so naive

[Chorus]
'Cause I thought you were the Homerun Hitter, the cherry that never bitters
Like the first taste of heat, the feeling I want to keep until I'm dead (Dead, dead)
There's nothing I could do (Do, do)
And I thought you were a Cold Blood Assassin, a  truth I couldn't imagine
But that light never painted the room
Now there's nothing I could do (Do, do)
To make it easier on—
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on you

[Bridge]
There's nothing I could say to keep those gorgeous eyes from crying
There's nothing I could do
If I lose you, I lose too

[Chorus]
'Cause I thought you were the Homerun Hitter, the cherry that never bitters
Like the first taste of heat, the feeling I want to keep until I'm dead (Dead, dead)
There's nothing I could do (Do, do)
And I thought you were a Cold Blood Assassin, a  truth I couldn't imagine
But that light never painted the room
Now there's nothing I could do (Do, do)
To make it easier on—

[Post-Chorus]
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on—, easier on—
Easier on youEmbed
