An End Has a Start Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't think that it's gonna rain again today
There's a devil at your side
But an angel on her way

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone hit the light
'cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd been and wanna go to
[Chorus 1]
You came on your own
That's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe

[Verse 2]
I won't disappoint you as you fall apart
Some things should be simple
Even an end has a start

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone hit the light
'cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd been and wanna go to

[Chorus 1]
You came on your own
That's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe

[Post-Chorus 1]
You'll lose everything
By the end
Still my broken limbs
You find time to mend
You might also like[Bridge]
More and more people I know are getting ill
Pull something good from the ashes
Now be still

[Chorus 1]
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands and air to breathe

[Post-Chorus 2]
You'll lose everything by the end
Still my broken limbs you choose to mend

[Chorus 2]
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave

You came on your own
You came on your own4Embed
