This Beautiful Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
What in the world are we doing here?
What is the meaning of it all?
To fall in love, to make a life that's calm and stable
Or just to find a place where I belong?

[Verse 2]
What in the world am I looking for?
What is the peace that I can find?
This longing for, I can't ignore but am I able
To see the good and taste it on my tongue?
[Chorus]
All that I know, all that I see
All that I feel inside of me
All that I've done, all that I've tried
There must be more to this beautiful life

[Verse 3]
Well, I go to the water to find innocence
Breathe deep the air to fill my lungs
And beauty sings His songs to me, every note I follow
To find out where the voice is coming from

[Chorus]
All that I know, all that I see
All that I feel inside of me
All that I've done, all that I've tried
There must be more to this beautiful life

[Bridge]
Whoa, and I can't be satisfied
Whoa, this well has long been dry
Whoa, what does it cost
To find a home for whatâ€™s been lost?

[Verse 4]
Well, maybe I'm a part of something that's bigger than me
Like I'm a page in a book in a library
And inside my heart, there's a dying part that's always searching
Because I know that there's a place where I belong
You might also like[Chorus]
All that I know, all that I see
All that I feel inside of me
All that I've done, all that I've tried
There must be more to this
Wonderful, terrible, beautiful life1Embed
