Congruency Lyrics[Intro]
Eh
Is there anybody else out
Eh eh eh

[Chorus]
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me
You get high, you get low, well by tomorrow said it's all the same thing
Goddamn
Keep my head up for tomorrow
Got a dollar I could borrow?
[Know there's just a small few to] shed a tear when I'm gone
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me (me, me, me)
[Verse]
I cannot relate to my peers
In a room but I feel likе the only one herе (yeah)
This feeling ain't rare
I've been dealing with this shit for years
Though I appear
Calm, cool, and collected
Looking like I ain't stressing
Looking like I ain't pressing
Looking for my time to come, I'm looking at the clock every second, I'm tired
I can't be something I'm not said I refuse to live a lie
It get dark inside my head when I got too much on my mind
I obsess about the art because to me it is sublime
Found serenity I did
I just cook up at the crib
I recall back when niggas really didn't have no love for me
I was on a warpath by my lonely
Had to realize that it's on me solely
So I stayed motivated
You can see what a nigga created
Going in 'til I'm cremated
Gotta leave a legacy to see my greatness

[Chorus]
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me
You get high, you get low, well by tomorrow said it's all the same thing
Goddamn
Keep my head up for tomorrow
Got a dollar I could borrow?
[Know there's just a small few to] shed a tear when I'm gone
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me (me, me, me)

Ima need more hope
Ima need more signs
A little more patience
A little more time
[Been holding onto space] for the peace of mind
Gotta go and get it every day I rise
Fly high god
Lemme stretch my hands so I could touch the whole sky
Why I put limitations on myself to numb the pain ah
Feeling the, feeling the, rain ah
Difficult try to explain it
Way that I'm living is dangerous
My mental state has been straining
All of my trauma’s remaining
Tryna put this shit in layman's
Time to get to the mainland, then again
I get higher, I get lower
It gets harder to be sober
It don't matter how you call it, either way we getting older
Hoping negative experiences never leave me colder
Even though these burdens getting hard to shoulder, god

[Chorus]
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me
You get high, you get low, well by tomorrow said it's all the same thing
Goddamn
Keep my head up for tomorrow
Got a dollar I could borrow?
[Know there's just a small few to] shed a tear when I'm gone
Is there anybody else out there that feel quite like me (me, me, me)Embed
