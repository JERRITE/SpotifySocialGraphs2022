Travellers Tune Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where do you go buttoned in your favourite coat
Stepping out to a different world
And you might be home late
And where are you now
Staring at your favourite box
The one with the traveller's cross
On the road past the gate

[Chorus]
But if you find yourself standing on the corner
While you're thinking of a different world
Then you might see me waiting on the corner
Staring through you in your different world
[Verse 2]
And if I could swim
Then I'd get out and find my boat
Sail away to my favourite coast
And let you all in
And if I could do all the things you're asking for
Then maybe I'd find your door
And bring it home to you

[Chorus]
But if you find yourself standing on the corner
While you're thinking of a different world
Then you might see me waiting on the corner
Staring through you in your different world

[Guitar solo/Guitar Break]

[Chorus]
But if you find yourself standing on the corner
While you're thinking of a different world
Then you might see me waiting on the corner
Staring through you in your different world

[Verse 3]
So where do we go
Like two Christophers in the snow
Yeah we're blind but we want to know
Just to say I love you
And all of our lives
We'll sail through the suns and moons
To sing our travellers tune
Just to say I love you
You might also like[Chorus]
But if you find yourself standing on the corner
While you're thinking of a different world
Then you might see me waiting on the corner
Staring through you in your different world

[Chorus]
But if you find yourself standing on the corner
While you're thinking of a different world
Then you might see me waiting on the corner
Staring through you in your different worldEmbed
