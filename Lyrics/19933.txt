I'ma take my time when I'm in it
(I'ma take my time when I'm in it)
I'ma make my mind up by tonight
(I'ma make my mind up by tonight)
No, I can't die when I'm singin'
(No, I really can't die when I'm singin')
I could live forever, way past the mic
(I could live forever, way past the mic)

[Chorus]
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passin' by, no one noticed my angel wings
Gettin' high 'cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passin' by, no one noticed my angel wings
Gettin' high 'cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why I might sing you a symphony
[Outro: Sample from The Omen]
