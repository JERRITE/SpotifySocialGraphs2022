If Iâ€™m Not Your Lover Lyrics[Chorus]
If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am
If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby...

[Verse 1]
I'm just a man
Who comes around at night
And to leave you, girl
Baby, that ain't right
You call me over and give me sexy talk
After things are over
You tell me take a walk, girl
[Pre-Chorus]
If you think
I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one
Who's loving you the most, girl
Material things
Don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

[Chorus]
If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend, yeah
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am
If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

[Verse 2]
Since this conversation
I'm so confused
Tell me, baby
Am I being used?
Dedication is what I want
You're being complicated
You know it's just a front, girl
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
If you think
I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one
Who's loving you the most, girl
Material things
Don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

[Chorus]
If I'm not your lover, yeah
If I'm not your friend
(If I'm not your friend)
Tell me, baby
(Just tell me, tell me, tell me)
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Your friend
Just tell me what I am

[Bridge]
If I'm not your...
Just tell me what I am
If I'm not your...
[Chorus]
If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Just tell me, baby
Just tell me
Just tell me, tell me

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
(Not your lover)
If I'm not your friend
(Not your friend, not your friend)
Tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
Just tell me what I am (Just what I am)

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am (Just what I am)

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby
Just tell me what I am

If I'm not your lover
If I'm not your friend...Embed
