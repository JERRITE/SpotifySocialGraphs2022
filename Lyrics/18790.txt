New Found Power LyricsI'm living in seclusion
I left it all behind
The way for me to be satisfied
Simplified

A heart full of desire
I've been searching for a while
The day came I decided to be free
Joyfully

Leading the way
I'm here to stay
My mind is clear
Now the sun starts my day
Leaving all doubt behind
I was trapped all my life
Now the shades fade away
Many years I was blind
New found power inside

I no longer strive for fortune
I've already had it all
No fear, I walk on a solid ground
Still unbound

But I had a point in my lifе
I turned everything around
It's clеar that I was in denial

Leading the way
I'm here to stay
My mind is clear

Now the sun starts my day
Leaving all doubt behind
I was trapped all my life
Now the shades fade away
Many years I was blind
New found power inside

I'm here to stay
My mind is clear

Now the sun starts my day
Leaving all doubt behind
I was trapped all my life
Now the shades fade away
Many years I was blind
New found power inside

New found power
All my life
Now the shades fade away
Many years I was blind
New found power inside
