Swerve Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now we ain't tryna have no fuckin' party
Unless your girls tryna all get naughty
I got some lean in my truck right now
And I'm tryna make it all go down
My friends like sniffin' cocaine
They hit the strip club on a bitch and make it rain
I like making money on the fuckin' corner too
But I'd much rather be somewhere doing wall street deals
[Hook]
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
Whats the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on em'? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
[Verse 2]
Now I'm always flying down on the highways
I be tryna make a money turn to five ways
I remember when I used to have a two way
And now I make the club go up on a Tuesday
My cousin outta town with that new shit
He comin' right back like a new pit
He barkin' with that new fuckin' sparker
Niggas out here crazy like they Waka

[Hook]
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
Whats the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on em'? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve](4566289)

[Verse 3]
I don't like to share my drugs
Cause all these niggas wanna smoke my bud
Don't nobody have no fuckin' money
They laugh at jokes, ha ha, they think this shit is funny
But ain't nothin' funny at all
I had to make a hundred thousand before fall
I got niggas tryna kick me out my house
I got niggas in the trap like a mouse

I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
Whats the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on em'? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve

[Verse 4]
Now I'm bout to fly outta town
I'll be back in September when it's brown
On the leaves but I'll still have that green
I mean my friends kinda know what I mean
We be gettin' fuckin' drunk all the time now
I be tryna be in the high times now
On the front cover with my fuckin' dojer
I play games bitch I'm PlayStation controller
So let me swerve on em', so let me swerve

[Hook]
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
Whats the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on em'? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve32Embed
