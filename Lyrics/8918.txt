Rock & Roll Stew Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sitting in a transit all night long
Playing clubs and rocking right on
The road's much too long
Seems like I've been wasting my time
Wish I was home again sipping my wine

[Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
It's where I'm from, I'm on the road again
[Verse 2]
L.A. to London's a mighty long time
Eight hours flying can bring you down
Sitting near a suit whose red-neck's glowing
His eyes are moving but there's no life showing

[Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
It's where I'm from, I'm on the road again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm home again
Things sure much better
Biding my time with my little go-getter
No matter what they say
No matter what they do
Gonna end up in the middle of that rock 'n' roll stew

[Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, I don't care
It's where I'm from, I'm on the road again

[Outro]
(Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone)1Embed
