Better in My Memory Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been feeling, don't want to feel this
I hate the memories we made, mmm
I've got secrets, been up so sleepless
I need these memories to change

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna make it stop
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm gonna turn it off
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
'Cause I've had way too much
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm gonna turn it off, turn it off
[Chorus]
Reprogramming our history so it's perfect in my mind
Changing the way it ended so you never see me cry
It's better in my memory
One place that you'll never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need
You're better in my memory, memory, memory

[Verse 2]
Something's missing, the plot needs twisting
Replace these thoughts in my head
The truth needs fixing, our time rewritten
The good things we never did

[Chorus]
Reprogramming our history so it's perfect in my mind
Changing the way it ended so you never see me cry
It's better in my memory
One place that you'll never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need
You're better in my memory, memory, memory

[Post-Chorus]
You're better in my memory, memory, memory
One place that you'll never leave, never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need, what I need, what I need
What I need, what I, what I
Better in my memo-memo-memory, memo-mo-mo
One place that you'll never leave, leave, leave
Turn you into what I need, what I, what I, what I need
Better in my memo-memo-memory
Memo-memo-memory

Oh, you bring me to my knees
Forget every
