Crash 2.0 Lyrics[Intro]
Trap House Mob
Ayy, Mobz that sounds wavy

[Verse 1: Skengdo]
I heard mans whippin' the nicest pot (Yes)
Greedy cunt, yeah I want that grub (Want it)
You wouldn't think that I'm a skinny fuck
My chargies rise and they take mans block
Sparkz just lurk, man he come like fox
Free Slapit out the fuckin' box (Free him up, free him up)
Risin' heat and collectin' dosh
Bro don't stress, man the clocks don't stop
Think I'm puttin' my faith in thots
You must be mad, I don't love thots
Don't be silly, just suck my cock
Finish the job, get jiggy then bop
Cookie bud, yeah it comin' like rock
Raw flavours, don't give me that dust
Sticks and leaves, don't give me that stuff
Gelato wave got me feelin' all mad
Gelato wave got me feelin' all mad
You're beefin' me, I don't beef this don
I bought my rod but the fishes gone
Never grabbed my bait, man the shit gets long
Ask .22 how the drill raps real?
Then he drew man out, coulda made man spill (Ching)
Sittin' in the box, that's never the deal
Now everyone knows how Skengdo feels
[Chorus: Skengdo]
Don't make sense tryna crash on Crash
Crash do crash, but the crash don't chat
Been war ready like Clash of Clans
When we rise those things and we crash your clan
Don't make sense tryna crash on Crash
Crash do crash, but the crash don't chat
Been war ready like Clash of Clans
When we rise those things and we crash your clan

[Refrain: AM]
Back with a bang (Boop-boop-boop)
Slap and attack, crash in the back
Mind where you hang (Boop-boop-boop)
Act for the snap, chat dem are chat
Not for the gang (Ayy-ayy)
And do-do-do, look what I what brang, just look
Look how they ran (Just look)

[Verse 2: AM]
How you gonna crash on me? (How?)
Don't you know I step with cra', shh-shh, Crashaleen (Dudu)
Man fill up the ting with gas, uh-uh, gasoline (Dudu)
See a hella man talkin' wass (Wass, wass), wasaleen (Ugh)
Look how many times we lurked and the feds can't chat for me (No way)
She was tryna get me burst, but you ain't trappin' me (No way)
Bitch that's a mazza, uh, mazzaleen
If I make one call right now, get jump like trampoline (Dudu)
Clap man like tambourine (Ugh)
And if you ever get caught on road
I don't wanna hear that you ain't involved
Kick down doors, coulda bruck mans toes
Coulda bruck down bud, but you're brass and broke
Italian came with sauce and smoke, Italian shoes, Italian coat
They know, we know, Baghdad doin' the most
You might also like[Refrain: AM, Skengdo]
Back with a bang (Boop-boop-boop)
Slap and attack, crash in the back
Mind where you hang (Boop-boop-boop)
Act for the snap, chat dem are chat
Not for the gang (Ayy-ayy)
And do-do-do, look what I what brang (Just look)
Look how they ran (Just look)

[Chorus: Skengdo]
Don't make sense tryna crash on Crash
Crash do crash, but the crash don't chat
Been war ready like Clash of Clans
When we rise those things and we crash your clan
Don't make sense tryna crash on Crash
Crash do crash, but the crash don't chat
Been war ready like Clash of Clans
When we rise those things and we crash your clanEmbed
