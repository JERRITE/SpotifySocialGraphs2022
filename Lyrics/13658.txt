Sweet Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, I got this question on my tongue
It's probably gonna end up sounding stupid
Unless you tell me this is what you want
Then we can go-o-o, then we can go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I like the way we're swaying in the moonlight
And we're kissing like we're tryna say goodbye
I don't know if it's the drinks
But I need you to be mine
[Chorus]
I just wanna waste another day
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
We could watch the ocean fade away
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
We could watch the ocean fade away
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake

[Drop]
We could watch the ocean fade away
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake

[Verse 2]
I don't really care how we wake up
We don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
I hope there's nothing left inside your cup
So we can go-o, so we can go

[Chorus]
I just wanna waste another day
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
We could watch the ocean fade away
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake

[Outro]
I just wanna waste another day
Tell me can I be your sweet mistake
We could watch the ocean fade away
Tell me can I be your sweet mistakeEmbed
