Start Without You Lyrics[Intro: Alexandra Burke & Laza Morgan]
Don't make me start without you
[?]
La-la-la-la, ooh
[?]
Uh, RedOne, Alexandra, hey

[Verse 1: Alexandra Burke]
Eh, hey, I'm like a beast
Eh, hey, I'm like a beast
DJ dropped the record, I'ma start a stampede
He dropped the record, I'll start a stampede
Eh, boy, I push it out
Eh, boy, I push it out
Fire move my body like a merry-go-round
Front to the back, I'll make you go 'round
[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Get like me
(I don't wanna start without you)

[Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low
You 'bout to miss, windin' to this
Don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
I'm coming up, put down your cup
Don't make me start without you

[Post-Chorus: Laza Morgan]
Ayo, Shake it off and let me see you get it

[Verse 2: Alexandra Burke]
Eh, boy, way that I move
Eh, boy, way that I move
Body like a weapon that'll make you go boom
Hit like a drum, I'll make you go (Boom)
Eh, boy, oi, where you at?
Eh, boy, oi, where you at?
You're the only one that I want on my back
The only one I want on my back
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Get like me
(I don't wanna start without you)

[Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Oh, here I go, drip droppin' way down low
You 'bout to miss, windin' to this
Don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
I'm coming up, put down your cup
Don't make me start without you

[Verse 3: Laza Morgan]
Hear it out, push it out, watch it how she work it out
Poppin' a couple bottles, drink it down, and get another round
I know you love to rub a dub with a thug
Don't start without me, I just got in the club
You steal the show, no competition
You the hottest thing since the fire invention
Drop it from the air, like you give me amnesia
Shake it, shake it, shake it, like your booty got a seizure
Take it down
Propeller, she windin', windin', wind
And me press up behind, behind, behind
My girl, she know what to do, yeah
Drop it for me, missile that'll make me go boom
[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Get like me, get on the dance floor

[Chorus: Alexandra Burke, Laza Morgan]
Oh, here I go (Here I go), drip droppin' way down low (Down low)
You 'bout to miss, windin' to this
Don't make me start without you (Hey)
Oh, here I go (Here I go), you're moving way too slow (Get it)
I'm coming up, put down your cup
Don't make me start without you (Hey)
Oh, here I go (Here I go), drip droppin' way down low (Come here)
You 'bout to miss, windin' to this (I'm right here)
Don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go (Here I go), you're moving way too slow (Too slow)
I'm coming up, put down your cup
Don't make me start without youEmbed
