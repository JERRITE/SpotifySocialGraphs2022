Take Back The Track LyricsEvening
At a bar in Northside
Is where we all were last night
Somewhere too loud to hear ourselves
And just then
I heard something entrancing
I couldn't stop myself from dancing
To a song that went just like this
Take back the track
I wanna hear it again
Take back the track
I returned and I beg the DJ
To identify the song name
Oh, but she couldn't remember
That song, so beautiful and timeless
In the light of dawn I found it
Could you play it all over again?

Take back the track
I wanna hear it again
Take back the track

Take back the track
Do it again
Take back the track

Take back the track
I wanna hear it again
Take back the track

Take, take back the track
Do it again
Take back the track

Take back the track
Take back the track
Take back the track
Take back the track
Take back the track
Take back the trackYou might also likeEmbed
