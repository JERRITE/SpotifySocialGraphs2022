Keed talk to 'em!

[Verse 1: Lil Keed]
Yeah, watch your mouth
Yeah, yeah, pipe your ho down (Say what?)
Yeah, then we kickin' her out (Sheesh)
Yeah, left the ho quiet as a mouse (No cap)
Yeah, 23's yeah, on me now (Fuck that)
Yeah, talkin' 'bout smoke, we en route (Brrrp)
Yeah, talkin' bout that cash I'm en route
Yeah, yeah, when I walk in the building
Straps on us so don't pat me down
I told you that fire was on me (Woo)
Yeah, in these Armani jeans (Woo)
Ruth Chris steak, it ain't cheap
Tell her we can have a party (Yeah)
My main ho got diamonds in her teeth (Yeah)
Yeah, rockin' Louis sweatpants (Yeah)
Yeah, they came from overseas
(Keed talk to 'em!)
[Chorus: Lil Keed]
Bitch, don't want you, bitch (Nah)
Diving out the pool, bitch
Tell your nigga, "Move," bitch
I'm finna bool, bitch
I bring that slime, ho (Slime)
Y'all niggas 5-0 (Yeah)
Who done got vibe, ho? (Woo)
Yeah, we got blue Tonys (Blue)
She sent my location, had to move
Even though I got her babysittin' me (Brrr)
Know I should've blown your roof (Gah)
Pine-Sol the color of the ring (Pine-Sol)
And then she playin' peekaboo
Ain't talkin' Lord of the Rings (Say what?)
Yeah, this a tinted Audi coupe (Tinted)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Big rock tennis (Hey, big rock)
Stick, cocked semis (Brr, sticks)
Big block engines (Grr)
Slide in the stolo, mini (Slide)
Vibe with your ho, got her sinnin' (Vibe)
Get a towel on your toe for attention (Huh)
I arrived in a Rolls with no ceiling (Skrrt)
You could hit her, I could hit her, ain't no hard feelings
Keep the flood on my wrist, with these new baguetties (Flood)
Dug up a ditch when the stick cut machetes (Graah graah graah)
Shit sprayin' like confetti (Bow)
Leakin' out the body, spaghetti
Put about 100 in the Chevy
She fuckin' on the gang 'cause I said it (Gang)
Pop me a Perc', need my medics (Perc')
Pour a four up in this Snapple drink, heavy (Four)
Put the bands on the cash, no credit (Woah)
Get the mask, get the MAC, number 11 (Graah)
Pitch black, all black, like the reverend (Pitch black)
The diamonds all white, they from Heaven (White)
Pew, pew, bow, bow, you get the message (Pew pew)
These niggas ain't solid, they veggies (Sweet)
Bought a 'rari, robotic, get sexy (Bought a 'rari)
I fucked a lil' thotty, hit the X (Thot)
