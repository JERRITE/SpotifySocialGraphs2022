Starstruck Lyrics[Intro: Juice WRLD]
...Eyes lock

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Mark Hoppus]
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I'm off the Percs, she don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, no
This a conversation, not a love song

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Mark Hoppus]
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Everything that's wrong with me, is everything that's wrong with you
You threw the blade, I caught the knife
I'm right back in your room tonight
Reflections in the broken glass
No, I can't fix your broken past
Count my blessings, close my eyes
I'm right back in your room tonight (Oh)
I can't escape your shadow (Oh)
I can't forget what we don't know (Oh)
Your love is a sentence to death row
And you've got a seat in the front row (Oh)
Hold me close but you're cold as ice (Oh)
Watch me choke on every line (Oh)
And it feels like Hell tonight, it feels like Hell
You might also like[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Mark Hoppus]
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
We met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Mark Hoppus]
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
I'm here to serve a purpose
Girl, I know I ain't picture perfect
One more thing I know for certain
If you leave, I'll close the curtains16Embed
