Buck 50 Lyrics[Intro: Juice WRLD]
(Ayy, Scheme, you killed it)
Yeah

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I'ma keep it a buck fifty (Uh), you can't fuck with me (Uh-uh)
Try to run on me (What?), we gon' bust semi's (Grrah, Grrah)
In the trap house, water whippin' (Uh)
I'm fuckin' on a thot, in her kidneys (Uh)
Nigga, this my city (Uh-huh, my city)
Come and take a ride with me, oh-oh-oh (Ride with me)
[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Skrrt, swerve or somethin'
Hop off on your ass and go earn some
Gettin' to the bag on a daily basis
Hit Saks Fifth, I'ma burn some
I don't go shopping without my gun (Yeah)
.30 on me, why I take codeine with the blunt (Blunt)
.40 on me, why I sip codeine and smoke Runtz (Sticks), uh
Livin' my life on the money hunt

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Hatin' on me, but they wanna bе just like me, I know
Jealousy is onе of the ugliest things to show, oh
Poppin' A-215s, the only thing that numbs
Yeah, yeah, hit the plug, now I'm tryna get her some
These drugs got me stuck inside a prison
They put me in the groove, help me find my rhythm
I take drugs and tote my pistol
FN hangin' out Balenciaga denim
Pockets got Death Race for Love money in 'em
We set up shops, catch an opp then we skin 'em
Then mail his head to his motherfuckin' children
My goal is billions, I'm up millions
Superstar, not a civilian
Me and Ben Frank got cool, we chillin'
I ain't mean to say chillin', bitch, I'm billin'
At least I ain't drug dealin'
Hit the mall and I spend me a lottery ticket
I don't kick it with groupies, with my bitch, I'm bickin' it
Me and her get so high, we can't feel ligaments
Still fuckin' off of the Perkies, we intimate
Leave Earth, we ain't comin' back, nigga

I'm fuckin' on a thot, in her kidneys (Uh, yeah)
Nigga, this my city (Uh-huh, my city)

Livin' my life on the money hunt

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Uh, smokin' these Runtz
Hitting your bitch from the back and the front, uh, uh
Poppin' these Percs, I might just go berserk and fuck on a bitch all night long
I got thots inside my house, one way in and one way out
Put my dick up in they mouth, tryna feel what they talking 'bout
I'm at Coachella, double R on the truck, feel like Birdman, I'm a Young Stunna (Yeah)
Not a pedestrian, I shoot a movie like cameras, Gunner and Gunna (Oh yeah)
Bitch, I'm a superstar, I may pull up in a supercar fuckin' yo' mama
Drive the Hellcat like a NASCAR
Screamin' out, "Slatt," with my gun drawn
Opps comin' from everywhere, Call of Duty how they spawn
But I got killers everywhere, bullshit is what they're on
It's three strikes in this game of life, but I ain't worried, I'm Barry Bonds
Knock it out the park, Barry (I feel like Rick James)
Or maybe Rick and Morty 'cause my life is insane
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I'ma keep it a buck fifty (Uh), you can't fuck with me (Uh-uh)
Try to run on me (Yeah, what?), we gon' bust semi's (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
In the trap house, water whippin' (Uh)
I'm fuckin' on a thot, in her kidneys (Uh)
Nigga, this my city (Uh-huh, my city)
Come and take a ride with me, oh-oh-oh (Ride with me)

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Skrrt, swerve or somethin'
Hop off your ass and go earn some (Uh)
Gettin' to the bag on a daily basis (Uh)
Hit Saks Fifth, I'ma burn some (Uh)
I don't go shopping without my gun (Uh)
.30 on me, why I take codeine with the blunt (Uh)
.40 on me, why I sip codeine and smoke Runtz (Uh), uh
Livin' my life on the money hunt
