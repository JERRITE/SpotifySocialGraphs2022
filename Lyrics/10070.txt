Sweet Lady Lyrics[Intro]
It's only one, 03

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(G-slide and hit your Ricky ass)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay, but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh-woo
Go to court for a nigga like why, boo?
[Verse 1]
Fucked around and dropped some codeine in my champagne
She goin' in like diamond lane in the diamond lane
She goin' down like the motherfuckin' stock exchange
Addicted like some cocaine to the campaign
I like the 'Woods, kiss the motherfuckin' ashtray
One more time for Poo Poo, bet you I can make that ass shake
Baby, I can get you straight, don't act gay
Fuck it, I won't interrupt you, get them stacks, bae
I'm in Atlanta, you know one day I'll be back, bae (I'll be back)
Support my daughter May May, no back pay (Uh-uh)
If I gotta creep up on you with a masked face
Or put these bitches on the blade, fuck Backpage (Fuck that)
Doin' numbers like a motherfuckin' fax page (Woah)
Seventh letter, crooked letter, get your facts straight (Bangin')
All you niggas quick to tell, it's a rat race (Skrrt)
Waste your time hatin', I'ma go and rack chase

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(Hahaha, free my nigga Tang though)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo (Woah)
I know she gay, but I done fell in love with Poo Poo (Oh, oh)
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh-woo
Go to court for a nigga like why, boo?

Sweet lady, Grape Street lady, think she tryna have my baby
She know to have that sex appeal like Mari (Mari)
She know to always keep it trill like BA (BA)
I do her wrong, but I ain't in to being sorry (No)
My other hottie left a nigga for a flee J
He ain't rollin' with no money, he a cheapskate
Ho, I'm just tryna get a ticket like a sweepstakes
I love my hottie dumb thick like cheesesteak
Run that bitch like Diddy, have you walkin' for some cheesecakes
Making the Band, say I'm the man 'cause the D came
Had a bitch that look like Cassie workin' three blades (Hey)
I got a bitch who fuck me off the syrup, booty out
Smugglin' something, got a porno over Mookie house (Woah)
She got a body on her, pockets healthy (Healthy)
Which one look better, is it Kendra, is it Elthy? (Is it Elthy?)
I need a miracle, might ask the Lord to help me (Help me)
She a project bitch, but look hella clean
Just a couple up-and-comers that be on the scene
Fucked her once under the covers like up on me
Got her wishin' it was some way she could clone me
I'ma just pull up up the road, she's really lonely

[Chorus]
I'm from Grape Street, where we G-slide
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Sweet Shay Shay, would you be mine?
You know I like 'em dark skin like Shay Shay
Got that pretty smooth skin like Fay Fay
I think Shanini got a body like Tata
She fuck with Greedy 'cause he fuck her like a pornstar
Freaky-deeky, heard her pussy got that voodoo
I know she gay, but I done fell in love with Poo Poo
Sex appeal like butt butt, I'm like ooh-woo
Go to court for a nigga like why, boo?
[Outro]
I like all the hotties with the colors in they hair
Tats on they face with the buds in they ear
P-I-M-P, come and fuck with a player
Bang my whole gang and you know I won't care
At all, at all, at all
Watch a young nigga ball, ball, ball
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I don't know who I'm missin', oh
Can't forget Nae Nae, she thick as a bull
GiGi, she had all that ass, I ain't really seen her too much after the baby, but you see what was goin' on, haha
They say Pooka got it in, we ain't gon' talk about how, why, when, and where, hahaha
Hey, hey, if you from the Jordan Downs, then come over there
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Too many hotties in my section, I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all
Call me Greedy 'cause I want 'em all, hey
I get GiGi 'cause I wanna ball
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Take a project bitch off3Embed
