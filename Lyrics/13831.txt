All I Can Say Lyrics[Verse 1: Bria Salmena]
Sun comes up over the plains
Lay in bed, sleep the day away
Think of all the things we used to see
All those pictures of you and me

[Pre-Chorus: Bria Salmena]
And I, I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore

[Chorus: Bria Salmena]
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
[Verse 2: Orville Peck]
Warm nights wane, we hear the trees a-hummin'
Softly you whisper, you hope it ain't gone
Sit in bars, sit on sidewalks, sit down and just cry where you're standing
I sit alone anyway, every night in your arms

[Pre-Chorus: Orville Peck & Bria Salmena]
And now I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore

[Chorus: Orville Peck & Bria Salmena]
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

[Bridge: Orville Peck & Bria Salmena]
Count the lights, think of what we had
Baby, I'm headed back west
Go ahead, be beside yourself
Drive 'til we got nothing left
Hold my breath 'cause I'm scared to death
We didn't know it 'til now
I hate springtime anyhow

[Chorus: Orville Peck & Bria Salmena]
For now (Yeah, for now)
All I can say
All I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

All I can say, all I can say
All I can say, all I can say is goodbyeEmbed
