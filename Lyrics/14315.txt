Take A Ride (Lights, Camera, Action) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a ride, take a ride
We've only got one night
She's liftin' up her skirt
While I'm speedin' through the lights
Hands around my neck
While she looks into my eyes
I haven't felt like this in real long time
Take a bite, take a bite
There's no rules tonight
Just about to pull up
And she's ridin' like a bike
Tyres burnin', heads are turnin', let 'em look
'Cause, baby, I'm not holdin' back
Yeah, I want it all
[Chorus]
Show me somethin' that you've never shown before
Tell me somethin' that you've never told before

[Verse 2]
Come on, honey
Won't you take me to the floor?
Heart-shaped dust
And let the liquor pour
I wanna be, I wanna be everythin' you're not
A superficial wannabe, artificial rock
I just can't, I just can't
But I better let it go
Nothing's gonna stop us
We're just goin' with the flow
Fuck it, I ain't gonna stop it
I'm not holdin' back
Yeah, I want it all

[Chorus]
Show me somethin' that you've never shown before
Tell me somethin' that you've never told before
And forget about everythin', and just let it go
And make sure you take it all in, the afterglow

[Bridge]
I won't stop, I won't slow down (Slow down)
I'll take in this moment to the bitter end
I won't stop, I won't slow down (Slow down)
I won't stop, I won't slow down (Slow down)
I'll take in this moment to the bitter end
I won't stop, I won't slow down

I won't stop, I won't slow down
I'll take in this moment to the bitter end
I won't stop, I won't slow down
I won't stop, I won't slow down
I'll take in this moment to the bitter end
I won't stop, I won't slow down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Show me somethin' that you've never shown before
Tell me somethin' that you've never told before
And forget about everythin', and just let it go
And make sure you take it all in, the afterglowEmbed
