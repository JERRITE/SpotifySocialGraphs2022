I Think Weâ€™re Alone Now (Single Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand
And so we're

[Pre-Chorus]
Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say
[Chorus]
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

[Verse 2]
Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
Cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're

[Pre-Chorus]
Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

[Chorus]
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

[Chorus]
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone nowEmbed
