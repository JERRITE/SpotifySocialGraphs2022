Good Rain LyricsIf there's a hole in your soul
You better fill it
If your cup is over flowing
Don't spill it, you better hold it

While the whole world is spinning around
And when your eyes look down at another
Just remember that he's your own brother
This kind of love ain't gonna go under
I've found and when you love one another
Only good rain comes down
And if you're feeling
Like you've stopped learning
If the wood in your fire ain't burning
You better sparkle a match

Start turning your wheel
You better turn in so it's right
Start living, stop taking and start giving
This is the one thing missing
I feel the love of one another is the only thing real

Well don't let your blessings turn into stone
That kind of live will live you all alone
If there's a hole in your soul you better fill it
If your cup is over flowing don't spill it

You better hold it while the whole world is spinning around
Well don't let your blessings turn into stone
That kind of live will live you all alone
And if your heart id troubled by a feeling
Just remember there's a way the spark healing

The first step is when you start believing
It's real and this is the only thing missing
I feel ohh I feel
The love of one another is the only thing realYou might also likeEmbed
