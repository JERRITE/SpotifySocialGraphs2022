Is It Just Me? Lyrics[Verse 1: Emily Burns]
It's been way too long for me to find it this hard
Sitting alone, my fingers pickin' the sofa apart
In attempt to distract from the fact that I miss you
I wonder if your friends have had to carry you home
And stay for the night because they don't wanna leave you alone
Where before it was fun, it's becomin' an issue

[Pre-Chorus: Emily Burns]
I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too
[Chorus: Emily Burns]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform and the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?

[Verse 2: JP Cooper]
It's been three months and two days and five hours
Since I walked away and we left it so sour, I know
That you're probably thinking you're better without me
And all my days have turned cold but not as cold as your shoulder
I've been thinkin' it over while I drink myself sober again
Please understand

[Pre-Chorus: JP Cooper, JP Cooper & Emily Burns]
That I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too

[Chorus: JP Cooper & Emily Burns, Emily Burns, JP Cooper]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform and the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak? (Mm-mm)
Or is it just me?
You might also like[Bridge: JP Cooper & Emily Burns]
'Cause this would be one whole lot easier (Ah, ah, ah)
God, I know that's selfish but it's true (Ah, ah, ah)
If underneath some calm exterior
You're all fucked up too

[Chorus: Emily Burns, Emily Burns & JP Cooper, JP Cooper]
Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops
Like you stood at the platform when the trains cross?
Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screamin' on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
With only cigarettes for company?
Are you cryin' in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?2Embed
