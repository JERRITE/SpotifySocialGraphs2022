Come Over Love Lyrics"Come Over Love"
(originally by Estelle)

[Intro:]
Ooh ooh oh ooh
Ooh ooh oh ooh

[Verse 1:]
If I was to tell you just how much I need you, would you come tonight
Would you not believe me cuz a love that easy never turns out right
I'm trying to change the rules, you deserve something good in your life
We've waited for far too long so come get your blessings tonight baby
[Chorus:]
Won't you come over love, so I can show you love
I promise I got enough to give you all that you need baby
So many search to find, a love that's good as mine
But I don't wanna waste your time so bring it all to me baby

Ooh ooh oh ooh
Ooh ooh oh ooh

[Verse 2:]
Baby let me teach you, give you love instruction, show you what I know
Need to take it easy, ain't no need rush now, baby nice and slow
All this love I can give to you, I expect just a bit in return
You don't have to be perfect love as long as you're willing to learn baby

[Chorus:]
Won't you come over love, so I can show you love
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need baby
So many search to find, love that is good as mine
I don't wanna waste your time so bring it all to me baby

Ooh ooh oh ooh
Ooh ooh oh ooh

[Bridge:]
Turn out the lights, give you all of my love tonight
Lets do what lover do, oh I'm ready for you
I don't wanna waste my time
So don't make me beg tonight
Don't keep me waiting for love
Won't you come over love
Come over love
I'll show you love, show you
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need baby
So many search to find, a love that is good as mine
I don't wanna waste your time, so bring it all to me yeah
