Hold My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't need a hero to save me
I'm not a girl to set free
It's nothing you did to me
I've always been this way

[Chorus]
I might be strong, I might be weak
There might be a part of me that I won't let you keep
Been on this road, and come this far
Don't need a man to hold my hand
I just want one to hold my heart
(I just want one to hold my heart)
[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid to hold this
Even the thorns have roses
I know I can stand alone
But I can't love on my own

[Chorus]
I might be strong, I might be weak
There might be a part of me that I won't let you keep
Been on this road, and come this far
Don't need a man to hold my hand
I just want one to hold my heart
(I just want one to hold my heart)

[Bridge]
Want you to, want you to hold my heart
Want you to, want you to hold my heart
Want you to, want you to hold my heart
Want you to, want you to...

Want you to, want you to hold my heart
Want you to, want you to hold my heart

Want you to
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to
Want you to hold my heart
You might also like[Chorus]
I might be strong, I might be weak
There might be a part of me that I won't let you keep
Been on this road, and come this far
Don't need a man to hold my hand
I just want one to hold my heart
(I just want one to hold my heart)

[Outro]
I just want one to hold my heart3Embed
