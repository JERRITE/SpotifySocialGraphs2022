Debonaire Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't need diamond rings or high priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashing things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million dollar hair
Modern dames without a brain, I never really care

[Hook]
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamour games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head
Or modeling for magazines or to be a debonaire
[Hook]
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
I don't care nothin' about it!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa, yeah!
Whoa!You might also likeEmbed
