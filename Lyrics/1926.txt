TranslationsPortuguêsNot Another Love Song Lyrics[Intro]
I don't wanna mess this up
Could it be too much to say I'm in—

[Verse 1]
Deep in, swimmin' in my feelings
I've been here before but it feels like I'm drownin'
Sinkin' in my overthinkin'
Tell me, am I foolish to think you need me here?
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
I wanna do this again
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' down 'cause I know that it's you I see in my dreams
I'm goin' down, let me drown over you, livin' in my dreams (In my dreams)

[Chorus]
I love the way you do it, don't stop, don't wanna lose it
I love the way you do it to me (To me)
I love the way you (The way) do it, don't stop (Do it to me), don't wanna lose it
I love the way you do it to me (I love the way you do it to me)
But

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna mess this up
Could it be too much to say I'm in—
I just wanna know what's up, do you feel it? 'Cause I think I'm in (Lovе)

[Verse 2]
I'm finna take my time, my mind, my rules
This ain't no crimе
Makin' love to you, though you ain't say it's mine
I had a hard time waitin' for you, boy (Oh, oh, oh)
Like ooh, boy, you, boy
Got me where you want, just gotta say and it's on
It's like, ooh, boy, do you know you got me like
Where do you go when you're alone? (I wanna do this again)
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, I wanna do this again (I wanna, I wanna)
Oh, oh, ooh, oh, I wanna do this again
Oh, oh, ooh, oh

'Cause everyone ain't you, babe
Want nobody but you, babe
