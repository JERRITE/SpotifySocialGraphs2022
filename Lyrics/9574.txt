FEED THEM Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mema used to tell a story about the earth and all the glory
Used to say it was more than dirt
All the kids would gather 'round, sitting on the ground
And she'd tell us what it's worth

[Chorus]
She said teach them, it will feed them
Plant the seeds they can believe in, keep on breathing
Play the beat loud on the bass drum
Spread the word, it's our world, we all stand now
[Verse 2]
Me and you, if we take action, we could start a chain reaction
Sound alarms for all our farmers, super heroes go beyond us
Every human for our children, give a hand now for our land now
That mеans you two over there, gathеr 'round, we got a plan how

[Chorus]
She said, teach them, it will feed them
Plant the seeds they can believe in, keep on breathing
Play the beat loud on the bass drum
Spread the word, it's our world, I'm singing freedomYou might also likeEmbed
