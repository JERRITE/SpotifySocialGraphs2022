Here I Come Lyrics[Intro]
Shoodilley-wop, shoodilley-woop, ooh woh ooh
Eeh-ooh, eeh-ooh
Ooh-eeh-ooh
Shoodilley-waddliley-diddley-diddley woh-oh-oh
Zeen!

[Verse 1]
On the intercom, Rosie tell me to come
Say, she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son
She said: "The lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come
And if you don't come quick, you're not gonna know that son"
So I grabbed a bunch of rose, and I started to run
Here I come (woh-oh-oh)
Two months later, she said: "Come and get your son
'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down
And because you are old, and I am young
Yes, while a me young, yes, I wanna have some fun"
Run me down
Shoodilley-waddliley-diddley-diddley woh-oh-oh, swing
[Hook]
I'm broad, I'm broad
I'm broader than Broadway
Yes, I'm broad, I'm broad
I'm broader than Broadway

[Verse 2]
When you go to Volcano, itâ€™s like a stage show
You have men that sing, DJ and blow
Put it on the radio (Put it on the radio)
Eeh-oh-eeh-oh-oh, swing

[Verse 1]
On the intercom, Rosie tell me to come
Say, she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son
She said: "The lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come
And if you don't come quick, you're not gonna see your son"
So I grabbed a bunch of roses and I started to run
Here I come (woh-oh-oh)
Two months later, she said: "Come and get your son
'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down
And because you are old, and I am young
Yes, while a me young, yes, I wanna have some fun"
Run me down
Shoodilley-waddliley-diddley-diddley woh-oh-oh, swing
