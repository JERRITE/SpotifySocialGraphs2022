A Guide To The (Solo) Discography of Royce da 5'9" LyricsI had the idea for this page a long time ago, when I revisited an old thread about Aesop Rock's discography, which was about 5 months ago

So for like a week after that spent literally hours to try and dig up pretty much every solo project Royce da 5'9" has ever done, in some cases with very little success. I still found some gems that many Royce fans probably don't know though, so yesterday I randomly decided that I'd finally write this thing now

This list will contain Royce's solo projects and one old Bad Meets Evil compilation, but I won't actually include all the PRhyme and Slaughterhouse stuff or the Bad Meets Evil album from 2011.Demo for Aftermath
(That's not actually a real, official cover by the way)Tracklist:01 Another Hit
02 King of Kings
03 United Divided
04 The Desert (feat. Wallstreet)
05 I Dare You (Freestyle)
06 Clap to This
07 Flash On
08 Friends
Finding this project was a pain in the ass so to speak. It was leaked to the internet somewhere in the mid-2000s, but when Megaupload got closed down, nobody ever bothered to re-upload it to any other filesharing website
So I went through a lot of research that ended up with "file not found" messages for me, until I found part of it on some old, fishy looking romanian rap forum and two other songs on YouTube of all websites. What I have declared unfindable for myself are only the songs "The Desert", "Flash On" & "Friends".

The only song from this project that reoccurs somewhere later in his discography is "King of Kings", but the other songs are quite interesting to listen to as well
For example the song "Clap To This" contains a lyrics in which Royce states his age ("I'm 20 with money"), which would make that song to be from 1997 and thereby one of the oldest recorded Royce songs I know of

Unfortunately I have no source for whether this is legitimatetly the demo tape Royce handed Dr. Dre back in the day or just a compilation of really old songsRock City mixtape and Rock City album(s)The mixtapeIn 2001 Royce released a Stretch Armstrong hosted promo mixtape for his upcoming album Rock City, which contained an intro with cuts from former Def Squad live disc jockey DJ Ev, two freestyles and six songs/snippets:Tracklist:01 Intro
02 You Can't Touch Me
03 Freestyle #1

05 What The Beat (From DJ Clue's The Professional Part 2)

I haven't able to find a copy of this mixtape so I unfortunately can't tell you whether those freestyles have ever been re-released or notRock City Vol. 1Tracklist:01 It's Tuesday (Intro)

10 Boom
11 What Would You Do?
12 Who Am I
13 Life (feat. Amerie)
This was supposed to be Royce's debut, but his record label at the time didn't want to put it out like that. It features songs such as the street hit "Boom" or the song "Life" in which he speaks to his newborn son and tries to explain the world to him. The song "She's The One" also exists as a Bad Meets Evil versionRock City Vol. 2Tracklist:01 It's Tuesday (Intro)

12 Soldier's Story

15 King of Kings

This is Royce's official solo debut right here and the tracklist is slightly different from the first Rock City. Still featuring all the gems the first edition had to offer (like "Life" or "Boom") but now also with another DJ Premier produced song ("My Friend") and even one with Clipse, produced by The Neptunes ("Mr. Baller")DJ Butter presents "Scary Music"This is the most complete inofficial compilation I have been able to find for all the old Bad Meets Evil stuff, and it might even be not that inofficial since DJ Butter would later do more mixtapes with RoyceTracklist:01 Re-Incarnated (Intro)

This compilation tape pretty much contains everything dope Bad Meets Evil put out back then, such as the original to the Eminem x Jay-Z song "Renegade". The only thing really missing from this is the full version of their legendary 12 minute Stretch Armstrong freestyle.Build and Destroy: The Lost SessionsThis is a double disc compilation Royce put out in 2003, with different tracklists for the US and the European version (I put both tracklists together into one).

This tape contains some of Royce's best stuff to date and features production from some legends like Pharrell, Just Blaze, Kanye West, The Alchemist, Dr. Dre and even the late great J Dilla. Some of these songs are diss tracks towards D12 (like "Malcolm X"), while others are tracks that send peacemaking messages towards them (like "Let's Grow")Death Is CertainTracklist:01 Intro

14 Death Is Certain Pt. 2 (It Hurt's)
15 Something's Wrong With Him (feat. 6 July)

This album is obviously well known for it's very dark tone and subject matter. Many Royce fans (including me) consider it their favourite album of his. Highlights include songs like the DJ Premier produced "Hip Hop" or introspective songs like "I & Me", "T.O.D.A.Y" or "Death Is Certain Pt. 2".Defending The Crown mixtapesDefending The CrownTracklist:01 King Detroit Of DJ´s (Intro)

I haven't been able to find this anywhere, so i can't really say much about it aside from pointing your attention to track number 19, which tells us that this tape is from pre Febreuary 2004. This is probably also one of the first solo records Royce has that features his younger brother Kid Vishis.Defending The Crown Vol. 2: Kiss The RingTracklist:01 Stay Tuned (Intro)

20 For The Fans (DJ Butter Outro)
21 Bonus Track

The only installment of the 3 Defending The Crown tapes that I was able to find, is also the one that features the least amount of Royce on it. It has a couple of promo songs from some of his M.I.C. homies (which are in parts really nice and it parts pretty boring) and some kind of weird remixes, alongside of some good Royce songs like The Illest (Original). This was released in June of 2005 and served as a promo tape for the Independent's Day album (see somewhere further below)The M.I.C. mixtapesM.I.C. Mix Vol. 1Tracklist:01 Welcome To The M.I.C. (feat.

This promo mixtape was supposed to put Royce's M.I.C. homies on the map back in the day and featured some cool tracks as well as some of his first self-produced songs (such as "Street Games"). Unfortunately I have not been able to find this project entirely, the only songs I was able able to dig up are the ones that are featured on the second edition (see below) anyways or were already on previous projectsM.I.C.: Make It CountTracklist:01 Buzzin'

Known among fans also as "M.I.C. Vol. 2" or "The official M.I.C. mixtape", this tape was highly anticipated and is a lot more commonly known among fans than the first one (which might be due to the fact that the first one is pretty much impossible to find). The song "Buzzin'" received some more recognition when Madlib made a weirdly indian sounding remix to itM.I.C. presents: Best Of Royce da 5'9"Tracklist:01 Buzzin'

I haven't been able to find this project in it's entirety either, it was leaked to the internet by a canadian guy who bought it at a Royce show in Ottawa, but all the links for it are pretty much dead by now and I have never seen anybody on the internet selling this either. But it's quite interesting to see that Royce apparently didn't think his career would last much longer after November 2004 when this dropped because otherwise he would not have released a greatest hits album after pretty much just 2 or 3 years of really being on the map in the rap gameIndependent's DayTracklist:01 Intro

18 Yeah

The album is called Independent's Day because Royce's birthday is on July 5th, one day after the american inependence day and he was an independent artist at the time. Many people don't give this project the credit it deserves as Royce's 3rd studio album. It may not be as great as the previous two, but there's a great variety of songs from party to gangsta to very dark. So there's pretty much something for everybody on this projectThe Raw SessionsRaw Sessions Vol. 1Tracklist:01 Real Talk

Very nice nixtape from Royce here, only track that I can't find anywhere is the number 03 "Pray". Most of the "songs" are just single verses and then over a minute of just the beat playing out. Highlights include the rugged "Pray For Me" and "Cry", which is a message of a deceased Royce to his mother, who mourns over the death of her sonRaw Sessions Vol. 2Tracklist:01 Apologize

The second installment of The Raw Sessions series features some amazing leftovers from the Death is Certain album, such as "T.O.D.A.Y. (Original)" and "Death Is Certain Pt. 1".  Seriously, if you know somebody that's a big fan of the Death Is Certain album, show them these leftover songs, there's a good chance they don't know them yet and finding those was like Christmas for me. Another highlight is the song "Apologize", which shows Royce apologizing to his wifeThe Bar ExamsThe Bar ExamTracklist:01 Dj Premier Intro

A fan favorite project right here. DJ Premier and Statik Selektah did a great job as executive producers of this mixtape and both contributed some dope original beats to this as well.

21 It's All About

This executively produced by DJ Premier album marked Royce's studio album comeback after a rough time of beefing, losing friends, reconciling with old rivals and going to jail. It features some stellar bars as always, as well as the song "Part Of Me", which is the story of a guy hooking up with two girls who cut off his dick. The song is so good and captivating, I promise you that if you are a male human being, you won't ever want to revisit it again. Go check out the DJ Premier produced single "Shake This" instead or go listen to Royce doing what he did best during those times: Rap about guns ("Gun Harmonizing")Success Is CertainTracklist:01 Legendary (feat.

07 I Ain't Coming Down
08 Security
09 Second Place
10 My Own Planet (feat. Joe Budden & Mr. Porter)
11 I've Been Up, I've Been Down

This is currently Royce's latest solo record and it features some of his best ever verses (i.e. "Legendary"), some great storytelling (like on "On The Boulevard" or "Security") as well as production from the always present DJ Premier ("Second Place), among others. Title and cover are obviously a nod to his 2004 album "Death Is Certain", but signing to Shady Records as Slaughterhouse and going Gold with the Bad Meets Evil album probably put Royce a almost polar opposite place to those timesUnfortunately this list ends on something released 4 years ago, but I'm confident that we'll see something new from Royce very soon. I'm very eager to hear sober Royce on a project other than PRhyme, which already was phenomenal. The new Slaughterhouse project should be great as well, they have assembled a dope production team, Joell is hungry as ever (not just due to his weight loss) and I do credit Joe Budden a little bit with Royce being more and more introspective since they formed the group in 2008. Everything Royce has been on recently has been nothing but fire (he was on Statik Selektah's new album with a solo track and featured on a bunch of people's songs), so I'm definitively ready for his next solo effort. Or a new Slaughterhouse album before that. Or PRhyme 2. Or all those things. PLEASEYou might also like14Embed
