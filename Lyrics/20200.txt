​i just need time (ƎTANG Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I did the unthinkable
I pulled you close and let you go
You couldn't even save yourself, save yourself
I was tryna fill a void in me
But I was just avoidin' me
I was tryna save myself, save myself
(Self, self, self, self, self)

[Build]
Oh, I just need time, I'm tryna clear my head now
Such a long night, I'm feeling like I'm dead now
It's a grave sight, got me off a med now
Fuck up my mind, I'm tryna see the end now
But the weeks fly by (By, by, by, by, by, by)
(Got a girl on the side)
(I'm ashamed tonight)
I was tryna save myself
[Drop]
Oh, I just need time, time, time, time, time, time (It's a grave sight)
I'm trying to clear my head, head, head, head, head, head
(Got me off a med—) Such a long night
Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night
I'm feeling like I'm dead now, dead now, dead now, dead now
(I'm tryna see the end)

[Verse 2]
I was tryna fill a void in me
But I was just avoidin' me
I was tryna save myself, save myself
(Self, self, self, self, self)

[Build]
Oh, I just need time, I'm tryna clear my head now
Such a long night, I'm feeling like I'm dead now
It's a grave sight, got me off a med now
Fuck up my mind, I'm trying to see the end now
But the weeks fly by (I don't feel like me)
(Got a girl on the side) Saying, "Come see me"
(I'm ashamed tonight)
I was tryna save myself

[Drop]
Oh, I just need time, I'm tryna clear my head now
Such a long night (Such a long night)
I'm tryna clear my head, head, head, head, head
(Got me off a med—) Such a long night
(Such a long night, I'm feeling like I'm dead now, dead now)
Got me off a med now, med now, med now, med now
(I'm tryna see-)

I got a lot of dark thoughts
I been low, I been low, I been low and gettin' low
Shoulda known (Shoulda known) that I'm so incapable
Of this love that I won't ever really feel a pulse
In my heart, it's not your fault, girl, I want it and I don't
I been sunk, I been slow, I'm just tryna stay afloat
Got a hoe and she blow, I'm addicted to that throat
When I'm low, I go low, break her heart, I take her soul
On the couch, on the floor, I don't ever sleep alone

[Outro]
Couch on the floor, I don't ever sleep alone
Couch on the floor, I don't ever sleep alone1Embed
