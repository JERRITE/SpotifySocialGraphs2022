Daisy Daisy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your shiver echoes in the morning sun
Mindless kisses like a Gatling gun
Your long hair tumbles out the bed
With silver dreams swaying over head

[Chorus]
Hold me daisy daisy like a reckless fool
Tell me daisy daisy are you meaning to
And though you never knew me, could you learn to
If I gave you my heart and my whole life too?
[Verse 2]
These dreams would kill me if I let them breathe
Making guesses on reality
I see my words roll down the street
When the red light shines I can hear him speak

[Chorus]
Hold me daisy daisy like a reckless fool
Tell me daisy daisy are you meaning to
Though you never knew me, could you learn to
If I gave you my heart, if it's not too soon?You might also like1Embed
