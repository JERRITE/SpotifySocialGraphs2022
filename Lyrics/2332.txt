LA DONâ€™T LOOK GOOD ON U Lyrics[Chorus]
105, you gon' drive me wild
L.A don't look good on you, baby
Out all night, UberX outside
L.A don't look good on you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Fendi or red bottoms
You can keep your problems
Baby, I don't want 'em, oh no
Louis bag or Prada
You can keep your problems
Baby, I don't want 'em, oh no
(I don't want 'em, no, no)
[Chorus]
105, you gon' drive me wild
L.A don't look good on you, baby (Oh no, yeah, yeah)
Out all night, UberX outside
L.A don't look good on you, baby

[Verse]
All your friends look the same, I can't tell who is who
Every night I see you out with somebody new
Losing your keys and picking up an attitude
Stay out too late and wake up in the afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Fendi or red bottoms
You can keep your problems
Baby, I don't want 'em, oh no
(Oh no, I don't, baby)
Louis bag or Prada
You can keep your problems
Baby, I don't want 'em, oh no
(I don't want 'em, no, no)

[Chorus]
105, you gon' drive me wild
L.A don't look good on you, baby (Oh no, yeah, yeah)
Out all night, UberX outside
L.A don't look good on you, baby
You might also like[Bridge]
You should slow down, baby
L.A don't look good on you
Should know that, baby
L.A don't look good on you
Should slow down, baby
L.A don't look good on you
Should know that, baby

[Chorus]
105, you gon' drive me wild
L.A don't look good on you, baby (Oh no, yeah, yeah)
Out all night, UberX outside
L.A don't look good on you, baby1Embed
