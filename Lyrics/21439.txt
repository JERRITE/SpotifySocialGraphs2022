A Public Affair Lyrics[Verse 1]
There go the street lights
The night's officially on
I got the green light
To do whatever we want
Gonna stand outside, the box
And put the rules on hold
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go
[Chorus]
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares? Let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)

[Verse 2]
Hey, baby, I see you looking over here, baby
Are you gonna keep looking or get up
And talk to me?
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go

[Chorus]
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
(All night, let's rock, don't stop, oh)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares? Let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)
(Who cares? Let's rock, don't stop, oh)

[Bridge]
Do what you wanna do
Tonight the world does not exist (No, no, no, no)
Move how you wanna move
All my girls work it out, like this
Give me room to shake, shake, shake
You might also like[Chorus]
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
(All night, let's rock, don't stop, oh)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares? Let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)
(Who cares? Let's rock, don't stop, oh)
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop)
(All night, let's rock, don't stop, oh)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares? Let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)
(Who cares? Let's rock, don't stop, oh)

[Bridge]
(Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop)
All night, don't stop
Who cares? Let's rock
All night, don't stop
(Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop)
Who cares, let's rock
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Hey baby
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
All the girls stepping out for a public affair (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
(All night, that's right, 'cause the party don't stop) (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
All the cameras come out for a public affair (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop, stop, stop) (Oh, oh-oh-oh)3Embed
