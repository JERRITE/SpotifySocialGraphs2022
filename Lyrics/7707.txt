She Makes Me Wanna Lyrics[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, okay
It's Dev and JLS
JLS
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1 - JLS]
I can't explain what's gotten into me
My sanity is in the passenger seat
I let her drive me she is my guide
We’re flying reckless tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
I'mma get it on on on on
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
I'mma get it on on on on

[Chorus]
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
London to Jamaica
LA to Africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2 - JLS]
I think her eyes are hypnotizing me
Something about her turns me into a wild beast
I mesmerized, down for the ride
Flying reckless tonight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
I'mma get it on on on on
Direct me to the floor
And turn it up some more
I'mma get it on on on on

[Chorus]
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
London to Jamaica
LA to Africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3 - Dev]
Well that's kind of funny
I-I was just thinking
How you make me oh-oh-oh
We’re flying over buildings
Sitting under palm trees
Drinking bubble gum drinks
We’re counting all our monies
Dancing in ice rinks
Buying icies
(It’s nothing)
We’re loving
We’re worthy of this
Look where I come from
Now this world our kingdom

[Chorus]
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
London to Jamaica
LA to Africa
She makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Makes me wanna
Oh oh oh oh oh oh2Embed
