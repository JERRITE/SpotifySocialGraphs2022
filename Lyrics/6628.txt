Legends Are Made Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I've got that lightnin' inside me
Son of a God
I'm like a titan that's risin'
Oh just you watch
I'm steppin' into fate
There is no time to waste
I've got that lightnin' inside me
This is how legends are made
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made

[Verse 2]
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
Victory is mine
Show you the harder the battle
The harder I fight
I've come too far to quit
Step back I'm goin' in
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
This is how legends are made

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made

Like iron
From the fire
Gettin' stronger
This is how legends are made
Above it all
Untouchable
A new animal
This is how legends are made

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made

[Outro]
I've got that lightnin' inside me
(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh just you watch
(Oh-oh-oh)
This is how legends are made
I'm like a titan that's risin'
(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh just you watch
(Oh-oh-oh)
This is how legends are made1Embed
