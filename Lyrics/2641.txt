Day ‘N’ Nite (Martin Jensen Edit) Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Day and night (Day and night)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play (Play)
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I’m not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
[Chorus]
'Cause day and night (Day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (Night)
He’s all alone through the day and night (Day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
'Cause day and night (Day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (Night)
He's all alone through the day and night (Day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Post-Chorus]
Day and night (Day and night)
Free his mind at night (Night)
Things won't ever change (Ever change)
Free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone (Phone)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
Hе's on the move, can't seem to shake thе shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep (Deep)
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (Too)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
You might also like[Chorus]
’Cause day and night (Day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (Night)
He’s all alone through the day and night (Day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
'Cause day and night (Day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (Night)
He’s all alone through the day and night (Day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Outro]
Day and night (Day and night)
Free his mind at night (Night)
Things won't ever change (Ever change)
Free his mind at night
At, at, at nightEmbed
