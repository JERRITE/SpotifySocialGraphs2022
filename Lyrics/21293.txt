Speed Parade Lyrics[Verse 1]
They come and they go when they want me
I sit and I wait my turn
I want to let go, but I can't see
All I know is from what I've learned
Hitchhiker born to the side of the road
Got your thumb out, climb in
Shut your mouth and do what you're told
This is where the ride begins
[Pre-Chorus]
Heads up, the mountain's comin' down
Like a ball and chain
Stand up, the best is all around
The question is, "would you like to calm the insane?"

[Chorus]
It goes on and on, just like a speed parade
It goes on and on, till the taillight reached my head

[Verse 2]
Here lies a rude instigator, or so he says
Is he movin', movin', movin', movin', movin'?
Or does he lie there and just play dead?

[Pre-Chorus]
Heads up, the mountain's comin' down
Like a ball and chain
Stand up, the best is all around
The question is, "would you like to calm the insane?"

[Chorus]
It goes on and on, just like a speed parade
It goes on and on, till the driver drops dead

[Bridge 1]
Drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'
You might also like[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Gotta get on the road or get on your knees
Hear the boy, he plays, he plays for speed (All that speed)
Faster boy, put your foot on the floor
Salivating, he just wants more (A little more)

[Pre-Chorus]
Here come the calm with the bold insane
Well, I can feel it like a ball and chain
When the question stands, does the shit remain?

[Chorus]
It goes on and on, just like a speed parade
It goes on and on, till the driver droppin' dead
Yeah-yeah-yeah
We goin' on and on
Just like a speed parade
It goes on and on
Till the driver, driver drops deadEmbed
