Best Love Story LyricsFreestyle Dada - Best Love Story. Feat. Joanna (Introducing)

(Chrous - Joanna)

Where did the love go
What happened to i love u girl
The night you broke my heart, i didn't loose my love
I lost my world
How did u live me
After all we been through
I thought you were my boy
You said i was the one
I know it wasn't true

(VERSE 1 - Freestyle Dada)

It's all running thru ma head girl i can't decide
This can't be right, I'm blacked out and i can't see light
And when i thought that we was fly u turned pesticide
I always knew that u were the one no jet lee style (huh)
Matters of the heart, matters of the heart
Got a nigga on his knees baby please come back (uhuh)
I want u here or i"ma
Load up this lead shower
And get the gun to ma dome blow and go gaga
Reminiscing on those times that u were here
Going through ur photos and merrn i shed tears
Ma homies warned me but i still played deaf ears
Never knew u would do this through all these years
And now is morphines and alcohol,wanna loose it all
Give me more greens i wanna fall,never love
Never will i love,never will i trust
Let the rain pour,let the plane crush

VERSE 2 - FREESTYLE DADA

Slow  dowwwwwn
Slow down baby
We used to run the town but now u down shoddy
Another round,baby try throwing u best at me
Held prisoner of your love i"m in custody
So laugh at me,some of your friends will
But i'm getting over u,ma heart is on a stand still
Buried in ma mind,light up i need a candle
Sharpening ma soul am straight outta the anvil
So get me gone,and turn it on,or maybe Shawn
Like a baby born,a new song,a new dawn
All these Armani, Gucci,Prada,and Louie Vuitton
Got me going bananas like u are donkey Kong
But don't worry,i appreciate your care tho
Taught me some lessons,it got me stressing and i learned slow
And now u gone am using it as ma tears oooh
U a bad ho,u a bad ho
