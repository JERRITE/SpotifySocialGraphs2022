Very Special Lyrics[Vocals: Debra Laws, Ronnie Laws]

[Verse 1]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes
I know our love was meant to be
'Cause our souls touched tenderly
Love is life and life is living, it's very special
[Chorus]
In my heart there was you, only
Love is life, what dreams come true
And even though I can't have you, baby
Desires like these are true for you

[Verse 2]
Hold my hand and take my life
Through these days adventure rules
Once my love was truly great
Then my life was sewed together
A change in life can bring good things
When you're here, love so supreme
Close to you, our lips should meet
To remember days so sweet
I need you and you need me, very special
Our love is joyous, yeah, we can make it

[Chorus]
In my heart there was you, only
Love is life, what dreams come true
And even though I can't have you, baby
Desires like these are true for you

[Verse 1]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes
I know our love was meant to be
Because our souls touched tenderly
Love is life and life is living, it's very special
You might also like[Break]

[Bridge]
Then your love excited me, baby
Days full of joy, no tears
Cannot keep this feeling inside, dearly
'Cause a girl like me has realized that

[Outro]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes...2Embed
