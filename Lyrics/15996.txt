Beautiful Lyrics[KEVIN]
We were so tiny
Happy and shiny
Playing tag and getting chased
Singing and clapping
Laughing and napping
Baking cookies, eating paste

Then we got bigger
That was the trigger
Like the Huns invading Rome
Welcome to my school
This ain't no high school
This is the Thunderdome
Hold your breath and count the days
We’re graduating soon
College will be paradise
If I'm not dead by June

But I know, I know
Life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray
For a better way
If we changed back then
We could change again
We can be beautiful
Just not today

[VERONICA]
Things will get better
As soon as my letter
Comes from Harvard, Duke, or Brown
Wake from this coma
Take my diploma
Then I can blow this town

Dream of ivy-covered walls
And smoky French cafes
Fight the urge to strike a match
And set this dump ablaze
You might also like[ARCHIE]
But I know, I know
I know life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray
I pray for a better way

[JOSIE]
We were kind before
We can be kind once more
We can be beautiful
Just not today

[BETTY]
And I know, I know
Life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray
For a better way
We were kind before
We can be kind once more
We can be beautiful

[JUGHEAD]
Just not today

[ALL]
Why do they hate me?
[JOSIE]
Why don't I fight back?

[REGGIE]
Why do I act like such a creep?

[ARCHIE]
Why won’t she date me?

[BOYS]
Why did I hit him?

[ALL]
Why do I cry myself to sleep?

Somebody hug me
Somebody fix me
Somebody save me
Send me a sign, God
Give me some hope here
Something to live for

[CHERYL, VERONICA, AND BETTY]
Ah, Heather, Heather, and Heather
I love Heather, Heather, and Heather

[CHERYL]
And you know, you know, you know
This could be beautiful
Mascara, maybe some lip gloss
And we're on our way
Get this girl some blush
And Heather, I need your brush
Let's make me beautiful

[VERONICA]
Let's make her beautiful

[BETTY]
Let's make her beautiful

[CHERYL]
Beautiful

[CHERYL, VERONICA, AND BETTY]
Okay? Okay!

[REGGIE]
Out of my way, geek

[FANGS]
I don't want trouble

[REGGIE]
You're gonna die at 3 p.m

[CHERYL]
Don't you dare touch me
Get away, pervert

[SWEET PEA]
What did I ever do to them?

[ALL]
Who could survive this?
I can’t escape this
I think I’m dying

[KEVIN]
And you know, you know
You know life can be beautiful

[VERONICA AND BETTY]
You hope, you dream
You pray and you get your way

[CHERYL]
Ask me how it feels
Looking like hell on wheels
My God, it's beautiful

[ALL]
Beautiful

[KEVIN]
I might be beautiful

[CHERYL]
And when you’re beautiful

[KEVIN]
It's a beautiful fricking day2Embed
