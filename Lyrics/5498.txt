Thru the Glass LyricsI wanna take a walk, rain cloud, coat on
And the wind is blowing from the south
I wanna climb a rock from bottom to top
Nothing is getting left behind

I wanna hear your voice call me call out loud
When you talk to me I'll hear you out
I wanna space it out
Too close move on out
It's all around for you to see
It's all I wanna see
But there's such a lot of baggage
You got us into this
So get us out of this
Get us out of this
Get us out of
You got us into this
So get us out of this
Get us out of this
Get us out

Oh get us out of this
Oh get us out of this
Oh get us out of

I wanna lose control look down scream out loud
Let the others sort it out

I wanna be impressed with everyone
Everyone give all the best

You got us into this
So get us out of this
Get us out of this
Get us out of
You got us into this
So get us out of this
Get us out of this
Get us out
