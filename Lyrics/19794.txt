Hopscotch Lyrics[Intro: Swae Lee]
Dumpin' out the lean, out of sight
Jumpin' out, the lean out of sight
Shawty will…

[Chorus: Preme with Swae Lee]
Hopscotch, jump into my ride, ride or die (Die)
Hopscotch, jump into her thighs, Slip 'N Slide (Slide)
I know you can see the dollar signs in my eyes (Eyes)
I don't wanna talk to you long, way too high (High)
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, birdies in my ride (Ride)
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirpin', birdies on my line (Line)
Step outside, see me poppin', pullin' up in my ride (Ooh)
All we wanna do is feel alive 'fore we die (Ooh)
[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Yeah, off the magazine with the stars (Yeah)
Crash the limousine, stumble out (Ooh)
I'ma make a scene with the yacht (Hеy)
Baby girl a fiend for that guap (Yeah)
You can't evеn reach, money tall (Reach)
New Tesla with the software installed (Installed)
I still got the drink, praise God
These niggas losin' but it ain't my fault (Woo)
These niggas mad but it ain't my fault
Two hun'ed racks, that'll break my fall (Fall)
Take off my shirt and, yeah, she takin' off her bra (Bra)
Jump in the drop, yeah, I mean, it's hopscotch (Hopscotch)
A lot of cameras, a niggas can't dodge (Dodge)
I'm goin' hard, nigga, no soft spots (Spots)
Don't wanna see us gettin' money? Don't watch (Fuck off)
I'm switchin' top models sittin' on my crotch (Yeah)

[Chorus: Preme with Swae Lee]
Hopscotch, jump into my ride, ride or die (Die)
Hopscotch, jump into her thighs, Slip 'N Slide (Slide)
I know you can see the dollar signs in my eyes (Eyes)
I don't wanna talk to you long, way too high (High)
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, birdies in my ride (Ride)
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirpin', birdies on my line (Line)
Step outside, see me poppin', pullin' up in my ride (Ooh)
All we wanna do is feel alive 'fore we die (Yeah, yeah)

Yellow tape the scene with the Glock (Yeah)
Came up servin' fiends 'round the clock (Ooh)
In my wildest dreams, never thought (Hey)
I'd hop out throwin' green at a thot (Yeah)
Now my money machine never stop (Yeah)
No lie, I'm with the team at the top (Yeah)
Don't try or you gon' leave with a shot (Woo)
Oh my, my bitch cream of the crop (Oh)
First whip came from whippin' in the pot (Ayy)
Gettin' top while I'm sittin' in the drop (Ayy)
Big shot, Scottie Pippen of the block (Block)
Big shot, .40 kickin' at the ops
Your bitch busy, nigga, please don't call (Brrr)
I'm goin' dizzy, doin' donuts in the 'Rar (Skrr, skrr)
A nigga got rich, praise God (Ooh)
Still can't believe a nigga made it this far (Yeah)

[Chorus: Preme]
Hopscotch, jump into my ride, ride or die (Die)
Hopscotch, jump into her thighs, Slip 'N Slide (Slide)
I know you can see the dollar signs in my eyes (Eyes)

Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, birdies in my ride (Ride)
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirpin', birdies on my line (Line)
Step outside, see me poppin', pullin' up in my ride (Ooh)
All we wanna do is feel alive 'fore we die (Yeah)Embed
