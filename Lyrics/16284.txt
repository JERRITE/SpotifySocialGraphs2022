Love Donâ€™t Live Here Anymore Lyrics[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 1]
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby
[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 2]
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 3]
Through the windows of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, babe
Love don't live here anymore, no, no, no
You abandoned me
Love don't live here, live here no moreYou might also like3Embed
