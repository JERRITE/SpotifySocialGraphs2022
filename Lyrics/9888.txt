Diapers Lyrics[Intro]
(Hurricane)
G-Lock, G-Lock, G-Lock, G-Lock
Yeah

[Chorus]
Dirty ass Sprite got me high as a kite (Yeah)
I be workin' all day and trappin' all night (Yeah)
Yeah, racks too big, gotta put up a fight (Yeah)
When I catch your boy, yeah, you know it's on sight (Yeah)
Everything I do wrong, feels so right (Bitch)
I lied like I love her, I should've said "Sike"
These niggas some bitches, these niggas some dikes
Yeah, bitch, I'm the shit, ayy, where is the diapers? (Ayy)
[Verse 1]
Shoutout to Glizock, that nigga my idol
Ayy, shoutout my lil' bitch, she don't need a title
Shoutout my opps tryna kill all my rivals
Yeah, nigga, and that's on my side-bitch (On God)
I'm sippin' on mud and smokin' on flowers (Phew)
Yeah, I got that bag in, I got some power (Phew, phew)
Just got two black 9s, Jae Crowder
My dawgs don't say too much, just growl
South Memphis like the wild, wild West
So you better find you a vest (Uh, uh)
Only twenty-four and I ball like a vet
Steppin' on everybody neck (Yeah)
Check, check, yeah, check after check (Yeah)
Nine letters, you know what I rep (Bitch)
I'm killin' this bitch, tryna fuck her to death
I'm gettin' to that bag, and that bag, ain't nothin' else
If it ain't 'bout that bag, you can bag it on up
Yeah, back in the day, I was baggin' it up
Yeah, sackin' it up, yeah, stackin' it up (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Dirty ass Sprite got me high as a kite (Yeah)
I be workin' all day and trappin' all night (Yeah)
Yeah, racks too big, gotta put up a fight (Yeah)
When I catch your boy, yeah, you know it's on sight (Yeah)
Everything I do wrong, feels so right
I lied like I love her, I should've said "Sike"
These niggas some bitches, these niggas some dikes
Yeah, bitch, I'm the shit, ayy, where is the diapers? (Ayy)

Then slapped me on my head (Yeah)
