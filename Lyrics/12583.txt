Dark Days (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Kelcey Ayer]
Finally what you came for
Finally what you hoped to find
Racing home from her house
Looking out for black and white
Dark days in the summer
A million ways to toe the line
Can't wait, holy other
Might as well be the seventh sign

[Chorus: Kelcey Ayer & Amelia Meath]
Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the afterlife
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why?
[Verse 2: Amelia Meath]
Moving in the shadows
Sneaking pass the warning sign
Chlorine in the green light
Bodies looking out of sight
Dark days in the summer
In the rain, the water's fine
It's a wild combination
Either that or right down the line

[Chorus: Amelia Meath & Kelcey Ayer]
Ooh, it goes hand in hand with fear for the afterlife
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it if we don't even know why?

[Outro: Kelcey Ayer & Amelia Meath]
I've been on the way
I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so long
I've been on the way
I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so longYou might also likeEmbed
