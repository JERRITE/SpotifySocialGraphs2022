One Me Lyrics[Intro: OMB Peezy]
Helluva made this beat, baby
Look

[Verse 1: OMB Peezy]
One me, three bitches
Too much smoke up in the room, fuckin' up my vision
Think 'bout takin' somethin' off, hey, them niggas wiggin'
Teach 'em how to tie they shoes, heard them niggas trippin'
Loose talkin' on the phone, I'ma think he snitchin'
Can't be on my line hollerin' 'bout illegal business
You could always find some cookies in my grandma's kitchen
Got a freaky bitch in Houston, saved her under "Whitney"
I might step down and fuck her if she willing
Grew up around it so I ride with extension
Used to tell me stay out grown folks' business
I might stop talking but I'ma still listen
Rob who? Bitch, I keep a thirty on my waistline
Fuck basketball, cross me over, then they dyin'
Bitch, I'm taking everything but I'm takin' my time
Run in a nigga house quick if he play with a dime
[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Two of y'all, that ain't enough
Better get some more niggas, that chopper eat a nigga's guts
Ayy, I'ma show niggas retaliation is a must
Done seen some shit up in these streets, don't know who I can trust

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
One me, five choppers
And I'ma shoot all them bitches, on my mama, ayy
Ammunition on my niggas, fuck a problem, ayy
Pop a nigga like a pimp pop his collar, ayy
Or pour some liquor on them bitches, dick all on her tongue
Huh, clip out on your son, trip you if you run
Ben Simmons with this pump, get a triple doub'
My crippled nigga, he a blood, still'll get it done
Gang gang like a band, sticks and the drums
Instruments in the club, pullin' strings for fun
My tall nigga swing on you, Brandon Ingram, ayy
I'm trappin' on the flip phone out in England, ayy
Me, Juan, Twan, Owen, B-Beezy, ayy
Pull up, serve your ass wherever you need it, ayy
Try to run off with the work, we squeezin', ayy
Got the straps, on gang, we keep it, ayy, huh

[Chorus: OMB Peezy]
Two of y'all, that ain't enough
Better get some more niggas, that chopper eat a nigga's guts
Ayy, I'ma show niggas retaliation is a must
Done seen some shit up in these streets, don't know who I can trust

Done seen some shit up in these streets, don't know who I can trust
Done seen some shit up in these streets, don't know who I can trustEmbed
