Would I Lie to You? Lyrics[Intro]
No, no, no, baby
Mm-mm-mm
La-la-la-la-la-la (Look into my eyes)
Would I lie to you, yeah? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on
[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on (Would I lie to you?)

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page a mystery (It's a mystery, yeah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine, woo! (In this heart of mine)

Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
Come on!

[Break]
(Look into my eyes) Ooh, ooh
(Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you?) Would I lie to you, baby? (Oh, yeah)
(Look into my eyes) Yeah, yeah
(Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you?) Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
(Would I lie to you?) When you wanna see me night and day
(Would I lie?) If I tell you that I'm here to stay
(Would I lie to you?) Do you think I give my love away?
(Would I lie?) That's not the kind of game I play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (In this heart of mine, deep in my heart)
Whoo!

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?

Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
(Would I lie to you, baby?) Come on!
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on and kiss me, baby)

(Look into my eyes)
(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
I wouldn't lie to you, baby, there ain't no one else but you
Oh, oh (Look into my eyes)
(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Come on, come on, come on, come on and trust me, baby
(Look into my eyes)
I won't lie to you, baby (Would I lie to you?) (Oh, yeah!)
There ain't no-one else but you, darling
Tell me what you need, I got what you need, yeah
(Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?) Ooh, ooh1Embed
