Why You Looking at Me (Demo) Lyrics[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh (Woo)
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see? (Woo)
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh (Woo)
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Verse 1]
Gimme that paycheck
Worked all week, now I wanna forget
Make it rain, so wet
I get lucky like Russian Roulette
Wanna lose control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all
'Cause it’s the weekend and I wanna let go
[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we’re up so high
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh (Woo)
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see? (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up, hey
Now I'm on a roll
Propane, I'm about to take off
Sippin' from bottles
Champagne with the cherry on top
Man, I lost control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all
'Cause it’s the weekend, I don’t wanna go home
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
’Cause we're up so high
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're ’bout that money

[Breakdown]
'Bout that money, 'bo-bout that money
'Bo-bo-bout that money
'Bout that money, 'bout that money
'Bo-bo-bout that money

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh (Woo)
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see? (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights (Lights)
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we're up so high (So high)
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money
