Meat This Lyrics[Verse 1: DDG & Blueface]
All this ice, I'm getting seasick (Ice)
She an innoncent lil’ bitch, but she need dick
I see where we going with this one, DD, you on that freak shit (Alright)
Bitch wanna meet me in person, tell her to meat this (Ooh)
DD, huh, I'm on some G shit
He a chicken, he ain't really with that beef shit
I can’t take no L, M's, N-O-P, bitch
Peep this, click the link if you wanna link, bitch (Young Mackey)

[Chorus: DDG & Blueface]
Bitch, I got the money just because of me
I only fucked with her once, but she in love with me
I got the drip, I'm mixing Louis with the double G
I told the bitch to keep me close, or she gon' fumble me
I get to wanderin' off on that other bitch for that other bitch
Huh, he a bitch, he postin' guns just to cover it
Too much bread, I might fuck around and butter it
[Verse 2: Blueface & DDG]
Shh, I got bitches from the A to LA
Ayy, BC, DD, these bitches bustin' like VVs
At the W, off the X while she poppin' them ZZs
I could give a fuck less ’bout a bitch with cheap cheese
I need ass, gas, or grass, pass me the weed (Weed)
You don’t really want that bitch, nigga, pass her to me
I could never fear a nigga, all these niggas gon' bleed
Big Glock, click-clock, nigga, get on your feet
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, bullets go doo-doo-doo
You and you, if I was Martin, I would’ve shot Bruh-Man
Every nigga from the same hood is not your mans
I could put your bitch on a flight that's not gon' land

[Chorus: DDG & Blueface]
Bitch, I got the money just because of me
I only fucked with her once, but she in love with me
I got the drip, I'm mixing Louis with the double G
I told the bitch to keep me close, or she gon’ fumble me
I get to wanderin' off on that other bitch for that other bitch
Huh, he a bitch, he postin' guns just to cover it
Too much bread, I might fuck around and butter it

[Post-Chorus: Blueface & DDG]
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, F&N get to bustin' in
Popcorn ready, bitches poppin', had to let 'em in
Airbnb, DDG make a TikTok
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop at your bitch pops
Big Glock and a Draco with a red dot, boom

Boom-boom-boom, man down
He thought a nigga was a joke 'til I ran down
I took a jet to that show, finna land now
I'm like, "Bitch, you ain't know? I'm that man now"
Hands down, psych, hands up, bitch, it's a stick-up
Diamonds on freeze, don't move or even hiccup
Ridin' 'round town with a MAC-10 in a big truck
Huh, yeah, alright, don't play with me, play with your bitch butt

[Chorus: DDG & Blueface]
Bitch, I got the money just because of me
I only fucked with her once, but she in love with me
I got the drip, I'm mixing Louis with the double G
I told the bitch to keep me close, or she gon' fumble me
I get to wanderin' off on that other bitch for that other bitch
Huh, he a bitch, he postin' guns just to cover it
Too much bread, I might fuck around and butter it

[Post-Chorus: Blueface & DDG]
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, F&N get to bustin' in
Popcorn ready, bitches poppin', had to let 'em in
Airbnb, DDG make a TikTok
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop at your bitch pops
Big Glock and a Draco with a red dot, boom1Embed
