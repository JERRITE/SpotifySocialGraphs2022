Miss You All The Time Lyrics[Intro]
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah oh
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah

[Verse 1]
You know that I don't like to say goodbye
I didn't know that we were out of time
I'm sorry that I couldn't save your life
So I walk, yeah, I walk
I go to pick the phone up every day
And imagine conversations we would say
But I'm always hanging up the same way
And I walk, yeah, I walk
[Chorus]
In the house where the heart don't cry
Dancing in a silver light
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
I miss you all the time
All the stars calling out your name
Ever since you went away
There's no sleeping you off my mind
I miss you all the time, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah oh
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah
(Miss you all the time)

[Verse 2]
I know that you were only passing through
In a moment you were lighting up the room
Oh, there'll never be another like you
So I walk, and I walk
And I try to keep my eyes up on the road
And remember all the stories that you told
Oh, I'm sorry that you'll never grow old
So I walk, yeah, I walk
You might also like[Chorus]
In the house where the heart don't cry
Dancing in a silver light
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
I miss you all the time
All the stars calling out your name
Ever since you went away
There's no sleeping you off my mind
I miss you all the time, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah oh
Woah-oh woah-oh-oh woah
I miss you all the time
Oh oh oh oh oh
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

[Chorus]
In the house where the heart don't cry (Don't cry)
Dancing in the silver light (In a silver light)
And I'm dreaming of you tonight
Oh, I miss you all the time
All the stars calling out your name (Your name)
Ever since you went away
There's no dreaming you off my mind
I miss you all the time
Oh, I miss you all the time
Yeah, I miss you all the timeEmbed
