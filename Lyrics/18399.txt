He Be Like Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Body smoking, marijuana, I get that shit from my mama
He always asking do I love him? I always be tellin' him, "Uh-uh"
He say that pussy so good that he wanna take off the condom
I told him he pushing his luck, he better be happy I fucked him

[Chorus]
He be like
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch, you that bitch"
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch"
[Verse 1]
I don't be callin' him daddy or nothing
Only if that nigga carrying something
Dick so good, wanna put it on lock
Like baby, we should go get married or something, look
Fuck him real good in the front seat, backseat
I ain't runnin', he ain't gotta catch me
Pussy in his mouth, he gon' suck it like a paci'
Bounce on it, drop on it, I do him nasty
He say I'm fuckin' like them hoes on Ebony
My pussy is his favorite recipe
I tried to ask him how it taste
But uh, right now I don't think he listening
I be like, "Dig in it, get in it"
So wet, wanna stay in it
Waterpark, wanna play in it, ayy

[Chorus]
He be like, he be like
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch, you that bitch"
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch"

I don't compete with these bitches
I don't share dick with these bitches
Why I'm offending these bitches?
I just want sex
I just want neck from these niggas
Don't really care for these niggas
Your nigga wanna be down
You lucky I'm turning him down, bitch
I think he'd be with the shits
You lucky I ain't give him rounds, bitch
One taste and I bet you he ain't comin' back
I be in his head, I be runnin' that
And if he ain't tryna give me everything
I'm the type to ask him where his daddy at
And I'ma fuck on him, squirt on him
Lick on him, suck on him
Ooh, fuck, but I ain't never ever tryna love on him

[Chorus]
He be like
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch, you that bitch"
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, fuck, ooh
He be like, "Damn, you fine"
He be like, "Damn, you thick"
He be like, "Damn, you bad"
He be like, "You that bitch"
