Arms Of Another LyricsBabe
How do you stand the rain
And how did you get to be
So close to invincible without seeming out of reach

How do you keep your eyes
Shining the way they do
With the same kind of wonder that brought me to you

Sometimes I find it hard to prove
I've been living without you
When I'm by myself
Oh how did you get to be happy with someone else
In the arms of another
In the arms of another

And common sense tells you that
It's a sin looking back
When you've worked so hard to get better
Sentiment will only end in tears

So how did you spend the years
And how did you get to be
This close to invincible when I'm still here

Oh I find it hard to change
How I'm thinking about you
When I'm by myself
Oh how do I get to be happy with someone else?

In the arms of another
Oh how do I get to be happy with someone else?
In the arms of another
In the arms of another

If you say my name then that's OK
You cross my path just the same
If you make me laugh then that's OK
You know each line on my face
You might also likeBut if I say your name that's not OK
So I cross my heart and be good
Keep the secrets I'll never tell
No never again 'cos you're happy with someone else

In the arms of another
In the arms of another

And yes
I tend to blame myself
For all the pieces
And yes
I find it hard to see myself
In the arms of another

And yes
I tend to blame myself
For all the pieces
And yes
I find it hard to see myself
In the arms of another

And yes
I tend to blame myself
That I'm living with you
And yes
I find it hard to see myself
In the arms of anotherEmbed
