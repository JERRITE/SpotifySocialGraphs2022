World in My Pocket Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could be the king
You're the queen in a dream
We could rule all day and night
It's never what it seems
Everything is nothing
Unless it's you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
But every empire gonna rise
And every empire gonna fall
And when you look at me
I believe I can see
A kingdom in your eyes
A kingdom in your eyes
[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got you

[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got you

[Verse 2]
You can take my heart
Make it stop make it start
Make it flash before your eyes
You could be the sparks
When I dance in the dark
Give me bright like neon skies

[Pre-Chorus]
But every empire gonna rise
And every empire gonna fall
And when you look at me
I believe I can see
A kingdom in your eyes
A kingdom in your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got you

[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got you

[Bridge]
Take the sun
And take the sky
Take the color out my eyes
They mean nothing without you
Take my body
Take my mind
Take my heart before it dies
They mean nothing without you

[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got you
[Chorus]
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing 'til I got you
I got the whole world in my pocket
But it don't mean nothing if I don't got youEmbed
