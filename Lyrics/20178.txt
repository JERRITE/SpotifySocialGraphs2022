â€‹netherrealm Lyrics[Verse 1: Shingami]
I'm so numb and cold, my skin and bones
Blood stains from the razor on my skin (On my skin)
I'm losing on my own
There's no way for you to take away this pain
This never fucking ends (It never ends, I'm too far gone)

[Chorus: Shinigami]
Is it wrong that I feel these feelings (Feelings)
What would you do if you came home
To see me hanging from the ceiling (Hanging from the ceiling)
[Post-Chorus: Shinigami]
Is it wrong that I feel these feelings (These feelings)
What would you do if you came home
To see me hanging from the ceiling (Hanging from the ceiling)

[Verse 2: $hy]
Now on the count of 3 I don't wanna see
Your fucking face ever again (Ever again)
And you can tell your friends
But I know when you're in bed at night
You know that you're the one who brought this in (You brought this in)
And I'll never see you again

[Chorus: Shinigami]
Is it wrong that I feel these feelings (Feelings)
What would you do if you came home
To see me hanging from the ceiling (Hanging from the ceiling)

[Bridge: Shinigami]
Get lost
Losing my mind
One day at a time
When the demons escape
There's nowhere to hide

[Chorus: Shinigami]
Is it wrong that I feel these feelings (Feelings)
What would you do if you came home
To see me hanging from the ceiling (Hanging from the ceiling)You might also like2Embed
