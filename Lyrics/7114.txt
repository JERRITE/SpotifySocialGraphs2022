F Myself Lyrics[Intro]
Actually, um, I'm not sure where I come in but it doesn't matter, huh?

[Verse 1]
To the person who called me an old hag, flop
You need to stream my whole catalog
Tell me why these frosty bitches just lack love
It has to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
If I wasn't so deep in love with myself
You might've fucked my whole day up as well
No you didn't think you would get a reply
Darling, I'll give you a piece of my mind
[Chorus]
If I had a dick, I would definitely fuck myself
I don't need a dick and I definitely don't need your help
Try to get a grip, go outside, baby, touch some grass
Once you figure out how to love yourself, comе on back

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, come on back
And try again, my friend

[Verse 2]
You just probably wokе up with really bad breath today
Someone stupid cut you off on the highway
Something tells me that you never felt truly safe
And that's okay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I wasn't always this chill and refined
I still say stupid shit all of the time
All that I'm saying is you’ve got a choice
Hope you can feel all this love in my voice

[Chorus]
If I had a dick, I would definitely fuck myself
I don't need a dick and I definitely don't need your help (Don’t need your help)
Try to get a grip, go outside, baby, touch some grass
Once you figure out how to love yourself, come on back
You might also like[Bridge]
While you were focusing on talking shit
And bringing me down (Bringing me down)
I was just thinking 'bout how magical you could be
If you (If you) were in your power

[Chorus]
If I had a dick, I would definitely fuck myself (Fuck myself)
I don't need a dick and I definitely don't need your help (Don't need help)
Try to get a grip, go outside, baby, touch some grass
Once you figure out how to love yourself, come on back

[Post-Chorus]
Come on back
Try again
Oh, woah, woah
Try again, my friend1Embed
