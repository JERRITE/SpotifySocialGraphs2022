Legends Never Die (Nightcore Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Legends never die when the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

[Verse 1]
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
[Chorus]                                                                                      Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

[Verse 2]
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

[Chorus]
Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

[Bridge]
When the world is callin' out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up 'cause
You might also like[Chorus]
Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never dieEmbed
