Little Flower LyricsRun together hand in hand
You fell into my world like a perfect plan
My little flower
You're lighting up the night
Run from the devil he pushed he down
He made me kiss the dirt
Made me hit the ground
My little flower
You stayed right by my side

Down Down! Dropping I hit the floor
I got a noose already, just break my jaw...Aw!
I wonder where it all went so bloody wrong
I walked away from my son
I know I gotta be strong
Run Run! Paster jump over the edge
I started falling down flying
I thought I was dead
And then you came to me with all of your strength
You slapped some sense into me
A sucker back on the mend

Why did you do it - How did you care
Why did you save me
When I couldnâ€™t even bear
So long dead beat' born again son
All feels better
Now the devil has goneYou might also likeEmbed
