TranslationsEspa√±olCloser To You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel it in my bones, even when I'm alone
Mama said, "I told you so," going down a different road
You call me late at night, I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind, get some peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change
[Chorus]
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

[Verse 2]
Can't push me away, I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways, say
So I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change

[Chorus]
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stayYou might also like10Embed
