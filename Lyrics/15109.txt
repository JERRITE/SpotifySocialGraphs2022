Pets Lyrics[Verse 1]
Children are innocent
A teenager's fucked up in the head
Adults are even more fucked up
And elderlies are like children

[Verse 2]
Will there be another race
To come along and take over for us?
Maybe martians could do better than we've done
We'll make great pets!
[Chorus]
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
My friend says we're like the dinosaurs
Only we are doing ourselves in
Much faster than they
Ever did
We'll make great pets!

[Chorus]
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!

[Chorus]
We will make great pets
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We will make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
We'll make great pets!
