Phone Down Lyrics[Hook]
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
[Verse 1]
I can make you put your phone down
As we cruise through the city
I can make you put your phone down
You ain't gonna text no one when you wit me
I can make you put your phone down
So you can show me attention
And I'll cut mine off too
Boy that'll help when I listen
I can make you put your phone down
Baby we don't need it
Every time you get a message
Act like you don't see it
I can make you put your phone down
Tell me do you copy and paste
I can make you put your phone down
Boy that ain't gon' stop me

[Hook]
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you put your phone down

Make you not wanna check that again
I could make you put your phone down
Ridin in a drop hair blowin' in the wind
Baby I will put my phone down
Cause when you talk imma listen
I can make you put your phone down
Leave it at the crib guarantee you wouldn't miss it
I could make you put your phone down
And it wouldn't leave your pocket
I can make you put your phone down
Probably wouldn't even know how to unlock it
I could make you put your phone down
I see your friend callin but forget em'
I can make you put your phone down
Your mama probably think you out there missin'

[Hook]
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone down

[Outro]
Ahh
I can make you put your phone down
I can make you, I can make you
I can make you put your phone (put your phone down, put your phone..)9Embed
