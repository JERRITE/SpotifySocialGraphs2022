TranslationsPortuguêsMatter of Time (Interlude) Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the ground up, don't you burn it down
Everybody's got the chance to turn it around
Rebuild it like a vase or a shattered crown
Dive into the ocean and you'll never drown
Darkness shows up, don't you let it grow
The light will shine in, then your heart will know
That all of these things that cause us pain inside
Will come and go (And go, and go)

[Verse 2]
When the roses bloom and the record don't scratch
Close your eyes, don't you ever look back
Painful lessons are a perfect tool
School's in session and the number onе rule:
[Chorus]
Ah, it's all just a matter of time
Ah, it's all just a mattеr of time

[Outro]
(It's all just a matter of time)
