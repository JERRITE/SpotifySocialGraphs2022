Come Over (Interlude) Lyrics[Intro: Shannon]
I know you wanna come over
You can come over

[Verse 1: Shannon & Aubrey]
Baby, I'm alone tonight
And I wanna feel alright
You already know what I like
Boy (If you come over)
I will lay it down so right
It will really blow your mind
Baby, just relax your mind
You know (Whenever you come over)
[Verse 2: D. Woods & Aundrea]
Ain't nobody thinkin' 'bout leaving
'Cause we've got each other in the end
You can stay until the
Morning (I love it when you come over)
Because I don't want to wake up alone
Baby, I'm checking the phone
Boy, you belong
Here (When you come over)You might also like1Embed
