Feels like Home (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time to pack my bags and leave, finally I feel the air I breathe in
And I can see the light, become a light in me
Well in your lights I'll always be

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
And I move myself away, when it don't feel like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
Like home, it feels like home
Feel like home
[Verse 2]
It's time to be a man and leave, I'll leave your safe grounds
Stop some distance, I am a light so
Light my high, well I'll become a higher me

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
And I move myself away, when it don't feel like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
Like home, but it feels like home
Feel like home

[Outro]
But it feels like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like homeYou might also likeEmbed
