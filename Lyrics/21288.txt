Neither Can I Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once had a friend
They found him in a car
A hose to the window
And the motor running hot
Seems he couldn't take it
The rhetoric of life
Someone found him naked
With a note right by his side
By his side
Woah, by his side
[Pre-Chorus]
He can't take it back

[Chorus]
Neither can I
No, neither can I
Mommy and daddy, I've borrowed the car to sleep on the floor
I'm sorry so much for bringing my own living hell to your door
Thanks for all the flowers
At the ringside seat
Thanks for nothing, everyone
The prayers were too weak

[Verse 2]
This is the way it happens, all the time
Can you pay attention to everyone that cries?
Remember, you can make it through
And make it new
Only if you try
You gotta try

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you can't take it back

[Chorus]
And neither can I
No, neither can I
Mommy and daddy, I've borrowed the car to sleep on the floor
I'm sorry so much for bringing my own living hell to your door
But things had gotten heavy
Everything was deep
Nothing really mattered
So, I just went to sleep
I just went to sleep
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't take it back
I won't try

[Solo]

[Bridge]
I won't try
I won't try (I won't try)
I won't try (I won't try)
I won't try

[Chorus]
Mommy and daddy, I've borrowed the car to sleep on the floor
Mommy and daddy, I'm sorry to tell you, life is a bore
Don't send any flowers
Don't send any more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't give it back
No moreEmbed
