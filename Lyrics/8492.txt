Where Are You Now (Kungs Remix) [Mixed] Lyrics[Verse: Calum Scott]
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song goin' 'round and 'round my head
[Build: Calum Scott]
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head, 'round my head
'Round my head
