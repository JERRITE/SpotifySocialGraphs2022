Lucky Lyrics[Intro]
Smokin' on loud
DP on the beat
Hey, baby
All the loud
You know I'm a star, you know you like it
She make me feel like I got lucky
Don't act like you love me
She make me...

[Chorus]
She make me feel like I got lucky, I got lucky, I got lucky
But she really only fuck me for my money, fuck me for money, fuck me for my money
Every nigga know, that lil' monkey, that lil' monkey, that lil' monkey
I'm a CEO, baby, these niggas flunkies, these niggas flunkies, these niggas flunkies
[Verse]
Ayy, girl, you want some money, ayy
Some money for your monkey
Girl, you lucky that you fucked me, you lucky
I'm smokin' skunky
I don't smoke duckies, I'm not a honky
Smokin' out the pound
You don't wanna fuck, bitch, watch ya mouth
'Fore you gotta get out
Get the fuck up out me house now, wow
You smoke mild, mild
I'm coughing up this dope like ow, ow
Baby, I see pounds of clouds
Pull up to the spot like, "Where's my money? Where's my money? Where's my money?"
'Cause you know it was a hard life for me, hard life for me, hard life for me, guess I got luckyYou might also likeEmbed
