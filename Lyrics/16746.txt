Lord Forgive Me Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, dear lord forgive me
I know it's been a minute but
I feel like this time I just gotta holler at you
Will-A-Fool, Will-Will-Will-William

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
'Cause lately I been all in my feelings, fuckin' all these women
Lately it's been hard for a nigga, God I been sinnin', lord
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
I've been taking somebody's prescriptions
I'm starting to think I'm gettin' addicted
Can't three days without 'em, I'm all in my feelings
I'm mixin' Adderall and Henny, lord I hope you hear me
[Verse 1]
Suicide thoughts be runnin' through my mind, all of the time, I ain't lyin'
I just be feelin' like if I wasn't here than everybody else would be fine, uh
I swear I don't want to die, yeah
But I keep mixin' them prescription drugs with alcohol, lows and highs, huh
I'm just tryna chase a high, yeah
I'm just tryna clear my mind, huh
I'm just tryna find the time
To get out my feelings and wipe all these tears from my eyes, yeah
Percocet help me sleep through the sad feelings
Got a check and start fuckin' these bad bitches
Cut 'em off when I find out they have feelings
So my ex bitch, I been a savage really
No good intentions, ain't no love here
I'll probably never know how love feel
'Cause everything I gave my heart to
Ain't with me now like it wasn't real
Really ain't been a good father figure
All this sinning, hope the lord forgive me
If you listen to me hope you all ears
Derez De'Shon

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
'Cause lately I been all in my feelings, fuckin' all these women
Lately it's been hard for a nigga, God I been sinnin', lord
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
I've been taking somebody's prescriptions
I'm starting to think I'm gettin' addicted
Can't three days without 'em, I'm all in my feelings
I'm mixin' Adderall and Henny, lord I hope you hear me

Lately I been in my feelings, lately I been poppin' all them prescriptions, yeah
Lately my lady been trippin', she say I ain't gave her attention, yeah
Really to keep it a hundred though
I just wanna fuck her, I don't wanna roll
I tell her to leave and she want to go
She don't want to go, she just go in her room and slam the door
All these prison letters in these envelopes
Niggas countin' on me, I can't help 'em
When my kids need me I ain't there
Send a couple dollars here and there
Dirty pistol on me, it ain't registered
I've been stayin' to myself, Cinderella story
And ain't no one around here stressin' for her, yeah
Mama used to say it'd be days like this
But I never thought I'd see it face to face like this
Lord I never thought that I would pray like this
In the booth confessin' shit, and I hope you hear me

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
'Cause lately I been all in my feelings, fuckin' all these women
Lately it's been hard for a nigga, God I been sinnin', lord
Lord forgive me (lord forgive me)
I know I been trippin' (I know I been trippin')
I really ain't got nobody to talk to so I hope that you listenin'
I've been taking somebody's prescriptions
I'm starting to think I'm gettin' addicted
Can't three days without 'em, I'm all in my feelings
I'm mixin' Adderall and Henny, lord I hope you hear me1Embed
