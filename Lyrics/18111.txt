Alive And Unwell Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna wake up
Can't cover up the pain with my make-up
All these strangers rip me to shreds
The beauty of the internet
But I don't make it better
You know I never have my shit together
I'm a bad drunk, can't keep a job
I'm a disappointment to my mom

[Pre-Chorus]
Think that I might lose it
Damn, I feel so insecure
If you ask me how I'm doing
One, two
One, two, three, four
[Chorus]
I'm alive and unwell
Some days I fucking hate myself
No, magic pill is gonna help
But at least I'm thriving in hell
Yeah, I'm alive and screwed up
Ruining everything I touch
I'm a hot mess, but guess what
I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Alive and unwell
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Alive and unwell

[Verse 2]
It is what it is, I am who I am
You can tell me what to do
But I won't listen
I'm a lost cause
I'm a bit depressed
I'm the worst even at my best

[Pre-Chorus]
Think that I might lose it
Damn I feel so insecure
If you ask me how I'm doing
One, two
One, two, three, four
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm alive and unwell
Some days I fucking hate myself
No magic pill is gonna help
But at least I'm thriving in hell
Yeah, I'm alive and screwed up
Ruining everything I touch
I'm a hot mess, but guess what
I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Alive and unwell
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Alive and unwell

[Outro]
I'm alive and unwell
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Alive and unwellEmbed
