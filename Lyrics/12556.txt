Me and Michael Lyrics[Intro]
Woah…

[Verse 1]
Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think, the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

[Interlude]
Woah…
[Verse 2]
In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

[Chorus]
Me and Michael (woah…)
Solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
It's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
Solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
It's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)

[Interlude]
Woah…
Woah…

[Verse 3]
Binary stars sink, like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think, the losing side would never break dividing lines
But sanctity wasn't in doubt
You might also like[Chorus]
Me and Michael (woah…) solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…) it's not a question now (woah…)
It's me and Michael (woah…) solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…) it's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah, woah…)

[Outro]
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
