Downhill Lyrics[Verse 1]
That’s just something people say
When they’re on their last leg and
They need someone to say something to help them cope
Or someone to say something hopeful
“I hope you’re okay”
But that's just something people say
And if I meant every word that I ever said
You would probably question the life I have led
You’d probably think I’m an evil, broken person
And you would be right
[Chorus]
Because I went downhill at such steep incline
That my rearview mirror showed me only the sky
And I laughed about it all night
And I said “Hey man, isn’t it poetic
That the sky is what we leave behind?”
Because I was born into the world on a silken cloud
And I got bored of the world before I hit the ground

[Verse 2]
And you’re the one who taught me to be brave
I’ve never spent a moment loving anyone but you
And maybe that’s just something that people say
But I hope that you know it’s the truth

[Chorus]
Because I went downhill at such steep incline
That my rearview mirror showed me only the sky
And I laughed about it all night

[Verse 3]
Because you were the first one to show me the stars
And they don’t mean much to me, but I still wonder where you are
Some nights, I still try to find you relative to constellations
All your relatives are still on vacation, or so I heard from a friend
Does it mean anything that you stayed in town?
Probably not
You might also like[Chorus]
I went downhill at such steep incline
That my rearview mirror showed me only the sky
And I laughed about it all night
And I said “Hey man, isn’t it poetic
That the sky is what we leave behind?”
Because I was born into the world on a silken cloud
And I got bored of the world before I hit the ground
“Hey man, isn’t it poetic
That the sky is what we leave behind?”
Because I was born into the world on a silken cloud
And I got bored of the world before I hit the ground5Embed
