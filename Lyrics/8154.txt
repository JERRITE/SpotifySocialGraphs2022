I Got a Feeling Lyrics[Intro: DThang, Tdot2Oppy & French Montana]
RPT (Grrah)
4Sev'-4Sev' (Grrah-grrah)
It's that Tdot, nigga (Grrah-grrah, grrah-grrah, boom)
Ayy, Y to the Gz, Gz to the sky, never put an O before my Y (Might not never, hey)
Even my abuela know that (Let's get 'em mixed)

[Verse 1: DThang]
Let's go (Let's go), we take a trip to the opps (We take a what?)
Tryna bury them niggas who diss on my block (Get that nigga)
No way, we be sendin' them shots, like, it's okay
Fell in love with my knock (Like, what?)
Bro get a check, we ain't showin' our opps (Get that nigga)
She want me to eat her, but move like a thot (Like, what, like, how?)
Red flags, I be puttin' a lot (Red flags)
Bro get a check, we ain't showin' our opps (Get that nigga)
She want me to eat her, but move like a thot (Like, how?)
Red flags, I be puttin' a lot (Red flag, red flag)
Red flags, I be puttin' a lot (Red flag, red flag)
[Chorus: DThang & will.i.am]

Reminiscin' how we took boy good life
You act right, I might put you on a good flight

Money make your bitch get wetter (Wetter)
South Bronx, can't get no better (Let's go)
I told DThang, "Keep your head up" (Head up)
I wrote Max B that letter (Wait, I got a feeling)
New Bugatti, that's matte black (Woo-hoo)
Send a diss song, gon' clap back (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
I don't trust nobody, that's that (That tonight's gonna be a good night)
Sunday Service with my strap (Bah, bah, boom)
Did it first before Soulja (Soulja, be a good night)
We comin' for the town, I told you (Told you)
We don't fake beef for the exposure (Like, how?)
Stuck on an island with Doja (That tonight's gonna be a good, good night)
Still throw parties when an opp die (Woo-hoo)
Still see red flags in her eye (Red flag, like, what?)
Pull up with Ye, Julia Fox, put that boy on FOX 5 (That tonight's gonna be—)
I brought Fergie to the block (Block), Fordham for the stunt (Tonight's gonna be a good night)
Me and Smurk before the deal, this ain't what you want (That tonight's gonna be a good, good night)
We got the streets, niggas ain't eatin' (Tonight's gonna be a night)
Niggas is fraud like all of my beefs
Montana just went diamond (Diamond, that tonight's gonna be a good, good night)
Still get you smoked, I be wylin' (Get that nigga)
She said, "Frenchie on some other shit" (No cap)
I got a hoopty, I call it a Cullinan (Woo, shit fat)
She wanna kick it, I told her, "I'm puntin' it" (Uh-huh, my strap)
Let me slide by (Gang) and this a drive-by (Gang, gang, gang)
[Chorus: DThang & will.i.am]

In L.A., smokin' opps, it's a good life
Reminiscin' how we took boy good life
You act right, I might put you on a good flight

Told my niggas this day was gon' come (On bro)
Now we up in L.A., havin' fun (Like what, like what?)
Couple bitches and bottles with a couple guns (Like what?)
Just in case if these goofy niggas wanna front (Grrah-grrah, boom, I got a feeling)

Like, bro really put RPT on the map (RPT, that tonight's gonna be a good night)
Bro be quick to be uppin' with straps (Like what?)
My demon, we brothers like Cody and Zack (On bro)
And the streets said, we could never lack (At all, that tonight's gonna be a good night)
Movin' daily, dressin' in all-black
Tell these rapper niggas, "Stop the cap" (Like what? That tonight's gonna be a—)
Just for you, we gon' roll a new opp in a pack (On bro)
And the streets said, we could never lack (At all)
