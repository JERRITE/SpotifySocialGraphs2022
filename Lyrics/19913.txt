Fell In Love At The Airport Lyrics[Intro]
GothBoiClique in the back again
Mackned

[Verse]
I never see your face again
Fucking up my sheets then she fucking with my head yeah
It's the way that you put it in the air girl
You love me better when I'm grabbing on your neck girl
Ten bands in my pockets with a shoe lace belt
Drugs make me feel alive it can be bad for my health
Nineteen hour flight just to see me
Can't pronounce the name don't know how it's spelt, yeah
[Hook]
I don't know what she fell for
I think I fell in love at the airport
How does she get into my head girl
How does she get into my head girl
Sometimes I wish that I never gave you a chance to hurt me
Sometimes I wish that I never gave you a chance to love me, love me yeah
Sometimes I wish that I never gave you a chance to hurt me
Sometimes I wish that I never gave you a chance to love me, love me yeahYou might also like1Embed
