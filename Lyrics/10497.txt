Being Harsh Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stay far on fire
It's okay to forget
I tried so hard to learn to say "Get out of my way"

[Verse 2]
Stay around the fire
It's okay to regret
I tried so hard to learn to say "I'll see you again"

[Chorus]
She calling
She calling
She calling you
She calling
She calling
She calling you

She calling
Calling
It's calling you
It's calling
It's calling
It's calling you
