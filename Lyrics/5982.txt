Down In The Valley Lyrics[Chorus]
Down in the valley
Where the girls get naked
If you throwin' bands
Then you know she gon' shake it
1, 2 break 'em
3, 4 rake 'em

[Verse]
These niggas grind hard
But these bitches grind harder
Climbing up the pole
Just to get out the bottom
The crowd, below
Stay ready for the show
The pimps, the dough
Don't let it take your soul
We make fallin' on the sky look easy
Look at my bitches gangsta walking on the ceiling
Green on the floor
Money talk, can you hear me?
This world is addicting
But dreams is expensive
Keep spending
Work hard for the top
Can't fall now
But whatever goes up
Must fall down
What you do
When the power out
Kids hungry
Can't do nothing but scream shout
We all choose to live
But it's different routes
Take the shit with shine
Gotta make it count
When you live and die by the paper out
Spend a dime just to make it out, yeah
[Chorus]
Down in the valley
Where the girls get naked
If you throwin' bands
Then you know she gon' shake it
1, 2 break 'em
3, 4 rake 'emYou might also like1Embed
