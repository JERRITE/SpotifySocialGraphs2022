On My Own Lyrics[Chorus: Goody Grace]
I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
All on my own, my own, my own, all on my own

[Verse 1: Jez Dior]
You see I dealt with way too much to take "no" for an answer
I lost way too much family, some to violence and cancer
I've been on a hide-away, and keep it all in my zone
Like, why the fuck do I need friends? I live this life on my own
I might sound selfish but loss to me is overwhelming
And medicine never helps so I'd rather be by myself and
If I stay alone, I can't lose anyone
I won't have to cry through the night and the sun
[Bridge: Jez Dior]
Got me talkin', talkin', talkin' to myself in the mirror
I'm no good for the world, but I feel good right here
Got me talkin', talkin', talkin' to myself in the mirror
I'm no good for the world, but I feel good right here

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
All on my own, my own, my own, all on my own

[Verse 2: Jez Dior]
I rest my head on my pillow just thinking 'bout it
Some things I saw when I was young were too traumatic
I spent my time wondering where my fucking dad went
I turn my TV all the way up for the static
Everything else felt too loud
I ain't even like my house
I can't even keep this down
I'm sorry for the words that come out of my mouth

[Bridge: Jez Dior]
Talkin', talkin', talkin' to myself in the mirror
I'm no good for the world, but I feel good right here
Got me talkin', talkin', talkin' to myself in the mirror
I'm no good for the world, but I feel good right here

I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
I've been getting high just to even out the lows now
I've been on the run, on the run, never slowing down
Lonely in the world trying to make it on my own now, all on my own
All on my own, my own, my own, all on my own
All on my own, my own, my own, all on my ownEmbed
