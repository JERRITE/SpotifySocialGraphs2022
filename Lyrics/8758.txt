Poor House LyricsYou walk in, half past nine
Lookin' like a queen
Serving me with papers
Calling me obscene

Woman, I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And you'll take all the rest

Up all day, down all night
Working on the job
Everything I do is wrong
I always end up robbed
Woman, I try so hard
Done all I can do
They're gonna put me in the poor house
Keep all the best for you

(Oh-oh, in the poor house)
(Oh-oh, in the poor house) Oh

If I drove a pulpwood truck
Would you love me more?
Would you bring me diamonds
And hang around my door?

Woman, I've done my best
They're ain't much left for me
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And throw away the key

(In the poor house)
(Oh-oh, in the poor house)

You walked in, half past nine
Lookin' like a queen
Serving me with papers
Calling me obscene
You might also likeWoman, I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And you'll take all the rest

(In the poor house)
(Oh-oh, in the poor house)
(In the poor house)
(Oh-oh, in the poor house)Embed
