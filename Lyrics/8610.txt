Old Habits Die Hard Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shame on me, slap on my wrist
At your door and I'm not proud of it
Yesterday I said "I'm done"
I swung back just like a pendulum

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ha ha)
Ooh, and the sugar turned bitter
Ooh, and the summer turned to winter
But I still want your love (want your love)
(Ha ha)
Ooh, they can tell me I'm a sinner
Ooh, but they can't call me a quitter
I won't give you up
[Chorus]
Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You know that I wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die hard

[Verse 2]
Made a promise, made a pact
With my fingers crossed behind my back
Like a creature you set free
I'll crawl back to you eventually

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ha ha)
Ooh, and the sugar turned bitter
Ooh, and the summer turned to winter
But I still want your love (want your love)
(Ha ha)
Ooh, they can tell me I'm a sinner
Ooh, but they can't call me a quitter
I won't give you up
You might also like[Chorus]
Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You know that I wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die...

[Post-Chorus]
One more time, wanna fade away
Too far gone to come back today
Old habits die...
One more time, wanna fade away
Too far gone to come back today

[Bridge]
Even though they tell me I'd be better alone
You're in my muscle memory and you're in my bones
A world without you is a world I don't wanna know

[Chorus]
Old habits die hard
Every time I say goodbye
I find a way to justify
Running to your arms
Old habits die hard
You know that I wanna change
I wanna correct my brain
You can't help who you are
Old habits die...
[Outro]
One more time, wanna fade away
Too far gone to come back today
One more time, wanna fade away
Too far gone to come back today11Embed
