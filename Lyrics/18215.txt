Almost There (Disney Princess Remixed) Lyrics[Dara Reneé]
Mama, I don't have time for dancin'
That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messin' around
And it's not my style

[Izabela Rose]
This old town can slow you down
People takin' the easy way

[Ruth Righi]
But I know exactly where I'm goin'
I'm gettin' closer and closer every day
[Ruth Righi]
Woo
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
And I'm almost there

[Dara Reneé]
I'm almost there

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
People down here think I'm crazy

[Izabela Rose]
But I don't care

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
Trials and tribulations

[Ruth Righi]
I've had my share

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
There ain't nothin' gonna stop me now
'Cause I'm almost there

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Ruth Righi]
I remember Daddy told mе
Fairy tales can't come true
But you gotta makе 'em happen
It all depends on you

[Izabela Rose]
So I work real hard each and every day
Now things for sure are goin' my way
Just doin' what I do

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
Look out, girls, we're comin' through
And I'm almost there

[Ruth Righi]
I'm almost there

[Dara Reneé]
People gon' come here from everywhere

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
'Cause I'm almost there
[Ruth Righi & Dara Reneé]
Woo
Woah-woah, woah, woah, yeah
Uh

[Ruth Righi]
Come on, come on, come on, now
Come on, come on

[Izabela Rose]
There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share

[Dara Reneé]
I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river, and I'm

[Dara Reneé, Ruth Righi & Izabela Rose]
