We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', so we're breakin' free

[Verse 1: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us 'til we're separate hearts
But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe
[Chorus: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
We're breakin' free
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
Can you feel it building?
Like a wave the ocean just can't control
Connected by a feelin', ooh, in our very souls (Very souls, oh)
Rising 'til it lifts us up, so everyone can see

[Chorus: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
We're breakin' free
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Gabriella, Troy & Both]
Runnin', climbin'
To get to that place to be all that we can be
Now's the time, so we're breakin' free
We're breakin' free (Ooh, yeah)

More than hope, more than faith
This is truth, this is fate
And together we see it comin'
More than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need
Both of us, breakin' free

[Chorus: Gabriella, Troy & Both]
Soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free (Breakin' free)

[Post-Chorus: Gabriella, Troy & Both]
We're runnin', ooh, climbin'
To get to that place to be all that we can be
Now's the time (Now's the time), so we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free (Oh)

[Outro: Troy & Gabriella]
You know the world can see us
In a way that’s different than who we are13Embed
