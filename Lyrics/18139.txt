Flashbacks Lyrics[Intro]
All these—
All these—

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I'm not supposed to be cryin' over you
But you the one I wanna be closer to
On your line, I'm waitin' on ya comin' through
Oh (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all these flashbacks
Made me wish I had you back, yeah (Woo)
Backtrack
I ain't tryna backtrack, no (No)
I shouldn't have put my all in that (That)
'Cause breakin' up is like a heart attack
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
No, no, no, I don't (Yeah)
'Cause I, I go crazy here without you, baby (I go crazy)
I do, I do (Uh)
Don't wanna go a day without you (Oh, oh, oh)
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Woah

(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
My love, oh, no-no

[Verse 2]
'Cause you on one when you said you loved me
There's no one that can take you from me, yeah
We both said we done (Yeah)
But we know the truth now
And I don't want nobody else fuckin' with you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, flashbacks
Made me wish I had you back, yeah (Had you now)
Backtrack
I ain't tryna backtrack, no (No)
I shouldn't have put my all in that (That)

Lickin' all that drippin' water, I'm lovin' your juice, yeah
They won't see us when they see us in the Bentley coupe, yeah
Windows tinted when I'm kissin' on that pretty cooch, yeah

But I know you love me
