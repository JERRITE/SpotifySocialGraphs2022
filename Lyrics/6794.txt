Drills in the Hills Lyrics[Verse 1]
Leave him ass naked with his socks off
Pop up out the cut, boy, this shit'll knock yo socks off
In the hills doin’ drills on them rich niggas
I don't ditch beef, but sometimes I like to ditch niggas
Here's a T-shirt, here a hollow tip, hit the dirt
Boy fuck what you heard, you get hurt, tryna steal some work
I was in the dark, where they lurk, I ain’t had no church
Now I'm in the 'burbs with the birds making hella serve
Try and run my pockets boy you funny, you must got some nerve
Super Soaker, it is not a Nerf, pinch your fucking nerves
Me and Bando finna make her swerve, yo' peace get disturbed
Shoot the preacher, doc, and nurse, so when you die, they can't observe
[Chorus]
Niggas wanna copy all my work like a fuckin' nerd
Yo bitch treat me like dessert, man, the way she slurp
Hit it from the back like I'm tryna make the baby burp
Hit my white shooter, call it Steve Kerr or Larry Bird
Told that bitch, I like Mary Jane, I can't marry her
Told that bitch I got AT&T but can’t carry her
She jump when I tell her jump, she’s a terrier
Gotta hair-trigger on me, shit get hairier

[Verse 2]
Nightmare on Elm Street, shit get scarier
Dick make her fall asleep, shit, finna bury her
He get an F forever, he get a F for effort
I ball forever-ever, I'm cold like sweater weather
I ball like dark lettuce, this clip will take measures
Bought an assault weapon, that shit say K Hetchler
Aye your lil shawty fucked the first day I met her
I guess it’s safe to say a nigga knew her way better

[Chorus]
Niggas wanna copy all my work like a fuckin' nerd
Yo bitch treat me like dessert, man, the way she slurp
Hit it from the back like I'm tryna make the baby burp
Hit my white shooter, call it Steve Kerr or Larry Bird
Told that bitch, I like Mary Jane, I can't marry her
Told that bitch I got AT&T but can’t carry her
She jump when I tell her jump, she's a terrier
Gotta hair-trigger on me, shit get hairierYou might also likeEmbed
