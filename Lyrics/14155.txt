Searching the Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
War is over now
I feel my mind returning
Carried on a cloud
Every nerve was burning over you
I never had a need at all for anyone
Anyone other than you
But now that's through
So through

[Chorus]
We're prayin' to get it fast
And we pray it's in the past
Is anything we do, ever gonna last?
Couldn't I have a clue?
Searchin' the blue
Couldn't I have a clue?
Searchin' the blue
I'm searching the blue
[Verse 2]
The lay of land disease
Rocky and uneven
The light that we receive
Clouded beyond reason
Still we breathe
A human knows its self throughout without a doubt
For better, for worse we will remain
The same

[Chorus]
We're prayin' to get it fast
And we pray it's in the past
Is anything we do, ever gonna last?
Couldn't I have a clue?
Searchin' the blue
Couldn't I have a clue?
Searchin' the blue
I'm searching the blueYou might also like2Embed
