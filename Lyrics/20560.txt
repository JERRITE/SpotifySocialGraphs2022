Solid Gold Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if we were made like lovers
What if we were more than friends
We could keep it undercover
We could have it how we want it
Make the feeling [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Excited, hearts ignited
No trying, out here vibing
Electric, so connected
Ecstatic, dancing with design
[Chorus]
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I'd like to know, want to know you better
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I'd like to know, want to know you better

This love could be solid gold
This love could be solid gold (bеtter)
This love could be solid gold
This lovе could be solid gold (better)

[Verse 2]
I just want to get to know you
I'm not feeling no one else
All I want to do is hold you
For a minute, can't you feel it
If you're in it, I'm into it

[Pre-Chorus]
Excited, hearts ignited
No trying, out here vibing
Electric, so connected
Ecstatic, dancing with design

[Chorus]
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I'd like to know, want to know you better
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I'd like to know, want to know you better

This love could be solid gold (better)
This love could be solid gold
This love could be solid gold (better)

[Bridge]
I could be the one you want, the one you need
This love could be your solid gold
I could be the one you want, the one you need
This love could be your solid gold

Solid gold, solid gold
Solid gold, solid gold
Dancing with design

[Chorus]
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I want to know, want to know you better
This love could be solid gold (solid gold)
I want to know, want to know you better

This love could be solid gold
This love could be solid gold (better)
This love could be solid gold
This love could be solid gold (better)Embed
