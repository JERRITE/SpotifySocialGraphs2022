Knife Under My Pillow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sorry, I don't mean to freak you out
But I hear someone inside my house
Heart racing, keeping me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Paranoia slipping in
Checking all the locks again
It's so loud inside my head

[Chorus]
Got me feeling paralyzed
I can't sleep without the lights
A chill is running down my spine
Staring out the window
A knife under my pillow
But it's all inside my mind
Oh, I'm holding on for dear life
Why's this happen to me all the time?
Got me staring out the window
A knife under my pillow
But it's all inside my mind
[Verse 2]
I know I've made this call before
Not crying wolf, I'm pretty sure
There's just some fears you can't erase

[Pre-Chorus]
Paranoia slipping in
Checking all the locks again
It's so loud inside my head

[Chorus]
Got me feeling paralyzed
I can't sleep without the lights
A chill is running down my spine
Staring out the window
A knife under my pillow
But it's all inside my mind
Oh, I'm holding on for dear life
Why's this happen to me all the time?
Got me staring out the window
A knife under my pillow
But it's all inside my mind

[Outro]
