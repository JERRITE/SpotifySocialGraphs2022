When something so near and dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire
When something so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone
[Guitar Solo: Brian May]

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
When something so dear to your life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is burned alive (Burned alive)
When somethin’ so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]

When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
