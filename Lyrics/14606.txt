[Verse 3:Akon]
When I came in the place shawty wanna play me
If i look at the place man she would've made me
If i gave her the rope man she would've hate me, would, would, would've hate me
I can tell by the place she would've blamed me
Wrap a dollar from my face she would get up on me
And we all in the place being going crazy, go, go, going crazy
Well, I know if I didn't get her she wouldn't be pleased
And I never forget her nigga for making her leave
It was the best situation yeah you wouldn't believe
Would, would, you wouldn't believe
Well, I know if I didn't get her she wouldn't be pleased
And I never forget her nigga for making her leave
