Bop to the Top (Nini & Kourtney Version) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Ashley Tisdale & Lucas Grabeel]
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away

[Interlude: Lucas Grabeel, Ashley Tisdale]
Caliente
Suave

[Chorus: Ashley Tisdale, Olivia Rodrigo & Ashley Tisdale, Dara Reneé & Lucas Grabeel, All]
Yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop, hop 'til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop, pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove 'til the music stops
[Post-Chorus: All, Ashley Tisdale & Lucas Grabeel]
Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme, gimme, shimmy, shimmyYou might also likeEmbed
