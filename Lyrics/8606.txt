All Right Now (Live) Lyrics[Intro]
You said goodbye (Woo)
I thought I would die
But I survived to testify
Said I'm all right now
This was written by Sami McKinney back in the day
Yeah?
Yes, alright now
There you go, it's alright
Woo, go
Yeah
Oh, I gotta move y'all
Yeah
Woo, come on, yeah
Uh, uh
I like it (Yeah)
I like it (What?)
Oh, woo
Alright, alright
Yeah
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Yeah, ooh, hey now, ooh
Hey, woo
[Verse]
You used to mean the world to me
My eyes were blind
I couldn't see the truth for all your treachery
(Woo)
Too tired to fight
I just accepted we were never meant to be
(Oh yeah) After the rain
I lived with the pain (Woo)
Of trying to find myself again
Alright, alright now (Alright)
Woo, yeah

[Chorus]
When you said goodbye
I thought I would die
But I survived to testify
Said I'm alright
Alright now, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
After the rain
I suffered the pain
Of trying to find myself again (You better sing, girl)
Woo, yeah, alright now
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

Woo, back in the day jam
Must've been fifty years ago for that one
I don't remember, but Sami McKinney wrote that, honey, yes
That's a good one, that's a good one, alright Sami
I had a video too back in the day for that
Really?
Yeah, girl, I only made four in my life
That was one of 'em, woo, gosh
That's hot, Patti, that was hot
Thanks, baby, thank you, darling
Oh, I tell you
We came to have fun
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes
This is amazing, this is amazing
Yeah
Especially at a time like this where we can come together
We need to have fun, yeah
You know, and share things throughout our lifetime
'Cause we've always been the same levels as we go, you know
We've never changed
Never changed
Never
Yep
Ooh, Gladys
What is this?Embed
