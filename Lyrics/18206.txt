Hope Youâ€™re Well LyricsSpread the word
Tell all of the Angels
She's not coming home tonight
I've been searching for some satisfaction no words can describe
Our course is changing all the time
I know she'll always be by my side

She whispered in my ear promises of a revolution
A change towards the light
I was lost but now I'm found again
She gave me a hand when i needed a friend
How could I be so blind
And every corner I turn
Reminds me of you

And I say
Yeah
I hope your well
Yeah
I hope you're well
I hope you're well

Have you heard
They're playing our song
I wished that you were here tonight
I've been searching with a satisfaction no words can describe
The intuition left behind
It's always on my mind
I've never been good with goodbyes
But still I try

And I say
Yeah
I hope you're well
Yeah
I hope you're well
I hope you're well
I hope you're well
I hope you're well
Oh I hope you're well
I hope you're well
