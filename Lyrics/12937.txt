When Iâ€™m With You Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, listen

[Verse 1]
Don't have to try too hard, don't have to act
I can just be myself, take off the mask
You make me forget I'm a lonely man
Basically, I'm sayin' I like who I am

[Chorus]
When I'm with you, yeah
When I'm with you, yeah
[Verse 2]
You feel like a sunset summer breeze
Don't have to take a shot for me to breathe
You make me forget I'm an anxious man
Basically, I'm sayin' I like who I am

[Chorus]
When I'm with you, yeah
When I'm with you, yeah

[Verse 3]
I feel calm, I don't get riled up
They can't get to me when I'm with us
You make me forget I'm an angry man
Basically, I'm sayin' I like who I am

[Chorus]
When I'm with you (Ooh, ooh), yeah
When I'm with you (Ooh, ooh), yeah
I'm with you

[Outro]
