Tiny Voices Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been all pinched up since Saturday
I've run myself dry of excellence
16 long years in-hale the bullshit in
Whatever I said on Saturday
Whatever I did, I'd do it all again
19 marks up walls, each year one short fall

[Chorus]
Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
[Verse 2]
What is this for ex-parking lot
The dreamers go by they never stop
20 plus 5 in, let the youth cave in

[Chorus]
Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down

[Bridge]
(Background talking)
Use your voices
Use your voices

Use your voices
Use your voices

[Outro]
Tiny voices
Make things harder
Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let downYou might also like1Embed
