TranslationsEnglishAin’t No Way Lyrics[Chorus: 6LACK]
Ain't no way niggas still doubt me after this shit
Ain't no way you been here this long and still ain't rich
I done dumped my savings and my dreams like ayy
Pull up on your bitch like wait
Still talkin' slick like wait
Nigga on the road, my escape
Humble as a bitch, but not today
Ridin' through the 6 without the Drac', but got the drape
Oh, oh, oh
[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Gotta take it slow, fuck up out my way
Been five years, still ain't took a break
I done did so much and still, I paved my way
Good poker face, do that shit with grace

[Bridge: Jasiah]
Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way
Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way
Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way
Ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way, ain't no way

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
I can't fake when bitches smilin' in my face
Wanna take what I make? Too bad I do this shit with grace
Can't relate, take a break, and come back when it resonate
I raisе the stakes (Yeah), I put thе fire to the flame, I put the hater shit to shame (Ooh)
Such a shame, they can't break a bitch with what they say (Bitch)
I wake up and I choose the money (Money), they wake up and they choose to hate (Huh?)
Can't mimic the image (Yeah), they don't know what to do (What?)
These bitches been itchin' for an issue, couldn't fit in my shoes
So I got me some puff, and I got me a pump (Huh?)
And I shot me a punk, bitch, I'm poppin' the trunk (Bitch)
Bitch, my trunk in the front, pussy poppin' and young (Yeah)
If I pull this chopper out when I shoot, bitch, better duck

Ain't no way niggas still doubt me after this shit
Ain't no way you been here this long and still ain't rich
I done dumped my savings and my dreams like ayy
Pull up on your bitch like wait
Still talkin' slick like wait
Nigga on the road, my escape
Humble as a bitch, but not today
Ridin' through the 6 without the Drac', but got the drape
Oh, oh, oh

[Interlude]
What's the real rules and regulations?
Like what's the conversation?
What you really sayin'?
Nah, for real, nigga
What you really sayin'?

[Verse 2: JID]
Ain't no way I ain't gon' Shawshank from out the shit
Shovel snow, shiverin' in cold
I don't want the silverware, shit goes
I saw myself sinkin', shawty slipperyed the slope
My partner praise a lot and slang dope
My block the same, we rock the same clothes
Watch the same shows, readin' rainbows, fuck the same hoes
Keep the bank closed, let the thing blow like
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Ain't no way this the way I'm livin' out my final days
I feel like JAY, chakra flowin' through me like a tidal wave
Rivals made to be a slave inside my suicidal page
Watchin' Paris with a H, we ain't where the Eiffel stay
Over the years, friends turn to enemies
Bullets curvin' left and right sort of like parentheses
Viciously, I can turn your sympathies to symphonies
And I can send you up the same day you try to sin for me
Niggas be gettin' famous off of infamy
Infiltrate the industry by usin' my life to write a hit
At first, I used to fight this shit
Jiggaman made his first album at twenty-six
I passed twenty-five, I was seventeen gettin' rich
Ain't no way I was gonna take what people sell me
Run the jewels 'cause I kill a mic on any LP
Trained up my body and soul, you can't derail me
Trust, between God and myself, they'll never fail me

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Ain't no way niggas still doubt me after this shit
Ain't no way you been here this long and still ain't rich
I done dumped my savings and my dreams like ayy
Pull up on your bitch like wait
Still talkin' slick like wait
Nigga on the road, my escape
Humble as a bitch, but not today
Ridin' through the 6 without the Drac', but got the drape
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Buddy]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh20Embed
