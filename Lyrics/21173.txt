2000 Miles Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's gone
2,000 miles
Is very far
The snow is falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you

[Chorus 1]
The children were singing
He'll be back at Christmas time
[Verse 2]
And these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream
You appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow
Sparkle

[Chorus 2]
Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time

[Bridge]
2,000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go

[Verse 1]
He's gone
2,000 miles
Is very far
The snow is falling down
It's colder day by day
I miss you
You might also like[Chorus 3]
I can hear people singing
It must be Christmas time
I hear people singing
It must be Christmas timeEmbed
