Never Leave You (Single Version) Lyrics[Hook]

Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(And I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time
I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
[Verse 1]
Hey yo, I've been there, right here in them bold streets
Late nights tryin' to write, mom sayin', "Go sleep"
A king here, music world within my own feet
Dealin' with the mainstream, thank the Lord daily
I'm sincere and I've been from the start
Ask Dyl, ask Will, man, I've had it in my heart
So I drop tears cause everything's changed
Reminiscing them days tryin' to turn the page
Cause I've been around the world, I've seen so many places
Livin' the life, I've worked so hard to make it
Tradin' the world for money, stars, and power
Livin' my life at a hundred miles an hour

[Hook]
I'm lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
Yeah, whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya

[Verse 2]
You must be jokin', don't tell me that it's over
I'm drivin' the scene forward, I'm a chauffeur
It's open, so come we all enter
Tired of bein' in the back, now we're cent
Now we're chosen, but they're tellin' us we're sellin' out
All we wanna do is open doors, man, hear me out
We're frozen, cause they left us in the cold
Only right I took my chance, now I'm bringin' it home
Cause I've been around the world, I've seen so many places
Livin' the life, I've worked so hard to make it
Tradin' the world for money, stars, and power
Livin' my life at a 100 miles an hour

I'm lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
I'm still loving you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
Yeah, whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya

[Verse 3]
Hey yo I dived in, and now I'm swimmin' in the deep-end
And I've been gone since the weekend
So how's your week been? Without me how you keepin'?
Well, this is come back season
Well this is come back season, I call it come back
I've seen the whole map and I'll be back by the evenin'

[hook]
Cause I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time
(Like the very first time)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time)
(Like the very first time)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I'm still lovin' you like it was the first time)
(Like the very first time)
Whoa, whoa ,and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
(I will never leave)
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave yaEmbed
