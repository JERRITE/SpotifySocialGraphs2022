Easier Said Than Done LyricsSay I don't miss you every day
Don't need you anyway
I can take your love away
Oooh, but it's easier said than done
Can't shout out to anyone
Can't hide my love for none
Say I don't miss you every day
Don't need you anyway
I can take your love away
Oooh, but it's easier said than done
Can't shout out to anyone
Can't hide my love for none
Say I don't miss you every day
Don't need you anyway
I can take your love away
Oooh, but it's easier said than done
Can't shout out to anyone
Can't hide my love for none
Say I don't miss you every day
Don't need you anyway
I can take your love away
Oooh, but it's easier said than done
Can't shout out to anyone
Can't hide my love for none
Say I don't miss you every day
Don't need you anyway
I can take your love away
Oooh, but it's easier said than done
Can't shout out to anyone
Can't hide my love for noneYou might also likeEmbed
