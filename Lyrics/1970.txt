Begginâ€™ On Your Knees Lyrics[Verse 1]
You had it all
The day you told me, told me you want me
I had it all
But let you fool me, fool me completely
Yeah, I was so stupid to give you all my attention
'Cause the way you played me
Exposed your true intentions

[Chorus]
And one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah, one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You messed with me and messed with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah, one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me
[Verse 2]
So watch your back
'Cause you don't know when or where I could get you
I've set the trap
And when I'm done, then you'll know what I've been through
So, oh, Mr. Player
Do you feel like the man now?
And I bet you're nervous
'Cause this song makes you freak out

[Chorus]
And one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah, one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You messed with me and messed with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah, one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me

[Bridge]
I know I'm being bitter
But I'ma drag you under
'Cause you just don't, don't deserve happy ever after
For what you did to me
After you told me you never felt that way
It was only just a game
You had it all
And one day
You might also like[Chorus]
And one day
I'll have you beggin' on your knees for me
Yeah, one day
I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You messed with me and messed with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah, one day
You'll be beggin' on your knees for me7Embed
