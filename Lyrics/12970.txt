I’ll Haunt You Lyrics[Verse 1]
As the sun slips over my shoulder
I can tell I've been getting older
Drawn to you like the horizon
I'm the first one to break the silence

[Refrain]
I can tell I've been getting
I can tell
I can tell I've been getting
I can tell
[Verse 2]
As the sun slips over my shoulder
All my need is pulling me closer
Only you make this rock spinning
Off to nowhere much more appealing

[Outro]
On the edge of the earth
On the crest of a wave
How long can we stay like this?
Leaning in for one more kiss
I'm holding you so long
I will haunt you when I'm goneYou might also like1Embed
