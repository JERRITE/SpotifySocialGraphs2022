Heart Skips a Beat Lyrics[Intro: Olly Murs & Rizzle Kicks]
My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat
Olly Murs, true lad
Rizzle Kicks, yeah
Them girls make your heart skip like, like

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
I can see, you're not yourself
Even when you're here, with me
I know that you're some, where else
[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
So, hung up
We can't, let go
If you really have, to leave
One more time just move, me slow

[Pre-Chorus 2: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
'Cause all you ever need to know is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat
You might also like[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Rizzle Kicks]
Rizzle Kicks, yeah
At the start of the night I was like, what? Let's have a team talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see Saw
Ooh, she let me sleep with her, I figured her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'm a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (Skip a beat)

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[Outro/Ad-Lib: Olly Murs & (Rizzle Kicks)]
My heart skips, skips a beat
(My heart skips a beat)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My heart skips, skips a beat6Embed
