Papa Lin Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight
Everything touching the moon is purple
I sleep for a while then my leg starts throbbing
So I make my way to the house, the kitchen for some tank water
Girl sits in the windowsill in perfect moonlight
And we get to talking
After a while, she says that she likes my chest
And I get shy and make my way back through the house
And all the while, the trees stand guard
[Chorus]
When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazy
When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazy
And then, when I'm awake the world is hazy
When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazy

[Verse 2]
And today while listening to new music
I dozed
A yellow-spotted hickering sang from the hill outside my window
The recollections I have of these last few days
I'm struggling to tell which ones are real
Now Papa, he's mostly busy in the shed
Turning sandstone into giant birds
And, he comes into the house
For snacks and coffee
Smelling like tobacco, dust and sweat

[Verse 3]
And today, while walking in the bush
I merged with the frequency of the cicada drone
And for a moment, my body is no longer my own
Think of you when the sun excites the tin roof
And when people ask me what I've been up to
I say
Not much

When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazy
When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazy
And then when I'm awake the world is hazy
When I stay at Papa Lin's I dream so crazyEmbed
