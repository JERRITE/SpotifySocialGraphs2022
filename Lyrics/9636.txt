Bottoms Up 2.0 Lyrics[Chorus]
Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up

[Post-Chorus]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
[Verse 1]
Miss. Keke P lookin extra glossy
Gotta rep yo style lookin extra flossy
I'm bossy but I keeps it cute
With my stunna shades on and a tree on my boots
Got that Chi-town swagga and I rocks it full
Yes, Mudville baby we don't take no bull
We keep it rockin when we move our hips
Do that ol' school step, then we make it dip

[Chorus]
Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up

[Post-Chorus]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up

Keep it movin man
Make it poppin man
I be on the move, gotta catch me when you can
Might see my face on the movie screen
Hypnotize you frame by frame and scene by scene
Stayin fly while I keep it fresh
Wrote this at 13 and now ya girl's a vet
Sittin' back, saying this a hit
While you sway side to side, and move your hips

[Refrain]
You got some swagga? Better let 'em know
You got some swagga? Better let it show
Take your swagga with you to the A, and roll it back up to the Bay
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away

[Chorus]
Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up
[Post-Chorus]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up

[Refrain]
You got some swagga? Better let 'em know
You got some swagga? Better let it show
Take your swagga with you to the A, and roll it back up to the Bay
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away

[Outro]
