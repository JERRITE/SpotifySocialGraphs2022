Weapon & the Wound LyricsI won't break this
It took so long to make this
The life I lead is getting through to me
I won't take this
Took so long to get rid of this
Anything is everything to me
What a step in time
Running after you
I don't know where you are
And I can't seem to get you
I want you to know me, yeah
The pain that greets me
Is the stick that beats me
Solid dream, hope isn't what it seemed, yeah
Words I can't miss
It's a song that sings you
Missing friend, tomorrow is the end

What a step in time
Find my place in life

Running after you
I don't know where you are
And I can't seem to get you
I want you to know me

Running after you
I don't know where you are
And I can't seem to get you
I want you to know me, yeah, alright

Anything is everything to me
Anything is everything to me, yeah, yeah

Running after you
I don't know where you are
And I can't seem to get you
I want you to know me

I don't know where you are
And I can't seem to get you
I want you to know me

Yeah
Don't know where you are
I want you to know meEmbed
