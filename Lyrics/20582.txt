This Groove Lyrics[Instrumental]
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do
[Bridge]
It's time to move (time to move)
Time to get loose
Anywhere you are
It's time to groove (time to move)
Me and you
Out there on the floor

[Instrumental]
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you doYou might also likeEmbed
