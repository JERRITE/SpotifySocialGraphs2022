​this is bs. Lyrics[Intro: Snøw]
I know yeah, I know
I know yeah, I know yeah
I know yeah

[Verse 1: Snøw]
I know I ain't perfect
You ain't gotta tell me baby
I already know this
All this negativity making me lose focus
Should've seen the signs, yeah
Could've been avoided yeah
And I know that, you don't wanna be with me
'Cause you wanna be with him
But can he take you places that, you ain't never been (no)
No, that you ain't ever been (yeah)
But you gotta admit that this is bullshit
If this is what you want then I'll say "okay"
'Cause I don't wanna fight, I'll feel so drained
Smoke a pound a day, hope the pain just go away (but)
But it don't
I don't wanna do this no more
Livin' really feelin' like a chore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna, I don't wanna do this anymore
Yеah-yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: Laeland]
Yеah
I been skippin' showers
Thinking bout you through the hours
Circling like I’m the long hand on the clock
You got a power over me and I can't shake it
When you're still callin' me baby
Yeah you say it to my face and then you're gone
Changin' places to get away with you
You're toxic I'm nauseous I don't know what to do
Yeah you text me "goodnight" right before you said your phone died
But I know you went with him to spend the night
You gotta admit that this is bullshit
If this is what you want then i'll say "okay"
'Cause I don't wanna fight it, I'll feel so drained
Drink like every day, hope the pain just go away, but
But it don't
I don't wanna do this no more
Livin' really feelin' like a chore
And I want this to work out so badly
But I think it's over and done

[Refrain: Snøw]
I know I ain't perfect
You ain't gotta tell me baby
I already know this
All this negativity making me lose focus
Should've seen the signs, yeah
Could've been avoided yeah
And I know that, you don't wanna be with me
'Cause you wanna be with him
But can he take you places that, you ain't never been (no)
No, that you ain't ever been (yeah)
But you gotta admit that this is bullshit
If this is what you want then I'll say "okay"
'Cause I don't wanna fight, I'll feel so drained
Smoke a pound a day, hope the pain just go away (but)
But it don't
I don't wanna do this no more
Livin' really feelin' like a chore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna, I don't wanna do this anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
