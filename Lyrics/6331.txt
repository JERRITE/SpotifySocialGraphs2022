First Person On Earth Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the beginning, there's a heat-wave
It's us from nothing
I caught a red-eye, out to bed-stuy
To get your lovin'

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one, girl
It's alright (It's alright)
[Chorus]
If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each other's sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you

[Verse 2]
Because you're timeless, you see me clearly
All of the violence turns to silence
When you are near me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one, girl
It's alright (It's alright)

[Chorus]
If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each other's sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And see it born anew
'Cause we got no secrets to tell
You know me like I know myself
Well, it's alright
All of my time in the world
I want you to be my one, girl
It's alright (It's alright)

[Chorus]
If you were the first person on Earth
We would be together when it ends
Started when we had no names or words
Finishing each other's sentences
Nobody understands me
Nobody like you do
So if I'm the last one standing
I would wanna watch it burn with you

[Outro]
I would wanna watch it burn with you
I would wanna watch it burn with you1Embed
