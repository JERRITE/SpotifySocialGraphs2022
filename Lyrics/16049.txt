Dance for Life Lyrics[Intro: Adam Hicks & Drew Seeley]
A-plus baby
Ooh
I see you, Drew
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Let's get it started

[Chorus: Drew Seeley]
Let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
Let's, let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
[Verse 1: Adam Hicks & Drew Seeley]
Now, now, now I started dancing, I'm feeling the vibe
I'll tell you how I'm feeling while it's still in my mind
Shock wave through your body that you feel in your spine
Killer rhymes help fill in while I'm spilling my mind like
One time, are you down for that?
See, I really want to know just where the dance is at
You know, the rhythm make our bodies want to answer back
And this dance can expand to our hands and clap, so
Get it poppin' like you dance a lot
And let it drop to the feeling where your hands will pop
Now, while your heads start rocking to the jams, I drop
Or feeling not, like (ooh, yeah)
Life is dance, we dance for life
The stage, the bands, the fans, the lights, so
When you tell me, you better answer right
'Cause baby, there's lights
We're gonna dance tonight, like

[Chorus: Drew Seeley & Adam Hicks]
Let's kick it off right, right, right (yeah)
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
Let's, let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
Yeah
Mm, (ready, dance, ready, dance)
I'm dancin' for my life

Now, now, now party, dancing, down for that
Move it all around, bring it down and back (oh)
You're seein' how they move when they heard the track
Around the map, they dance to the sounds of rap
Like, one time, are you down or not? (or not?)
To keep it all hot with the sound of pop
Probably need earplugs just to drown my watts
With underground flow, we're just down the top
Like party, dancin' life's on
And we might just dance all night long
'Til the night's gone with the right song
Give me a mic and a rhythm that I write on, uh
Take cover when the fight's on
Turn this whole rap game to an icon (icon)
Yeah, 'cause we givin' in hot
And if you really think you livin'
You should give it a shot, like

[Chorus: Drew Seeley & Adam Hicks]
Let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
Let's, let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
(Drew)
[Bridge: Drew Seeley & Adam Hicks]
I dance on the edge
Risking it all (sing it)
I move to survive
I gotta stay strong, oh
I gotta stay strong
Let's kick it off right now

[Chorus: Drew Seeley]
Let's kick it off right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life, it's my life
Let's, let's kick it off right, right, right, right, right
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life

[Outro: Drew Seeley & Adam Hicks]
Life's for dance, we dance for life
The stage, a band, the fans for life
So when you tell me, you better answer right
'Cause baby, this is like we gon' dance tonight like
Let's, let's kick it off right, right, right, right, right (yeah)
I'm, I'm, I'm dancin' for my life, life, life
I'm dancin' for my life
I'm dancin' for my lifeEmbed
