Goodnight Socialite Lyrics[Intro]
In the darkest corner of the house, I found her body there
Cold and stiff, spine in a twist
She left a note, it read like so:
My dearest one, here's what you've done

[Chorus]
I've got your knife inside my back
I've got your rope around my neck
I feel the poison in my veins
Corrode and eat away my brain
I've told you fifteen dozen times
And that's one hundred-eighty times
If I can't have you
Then no one can
[Verse]
She was an honest girl (Never told a lie)
Raised with the finest things (Far too rich to die)
A silver spoon, gold diamond rings
And her sainted mother, the benefactor
Of the inheritance that I was after
She's got a feeling that I'll get even
And if I can't have you, then no one can
(Whoa, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I've got your knife inside my back
I've got your rope around my neck
I feel the poison in my veins
Corrode and eat away my brain
I've told you fifteen dozen times
And that's one hundred-eighty times
If I can't have you
Then no one canYou might also like6Embed
