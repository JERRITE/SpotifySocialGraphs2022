Artificial Red Lyrics[Verse 1]
Artificial red
Smoke, poison consumed
In the house of ill repute
Is this the way I spend my days
In recovery of a fatal disease?

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
On a cloud of pink has turned to gray
And I'm alone again, yeah
Someone to hold against my own
Alone, untouched is what I crave

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Artificial red
Smoke, poison consumed
In the house of ill repute
Is this the place I search for love
When my need is within me, a gift from above?

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
