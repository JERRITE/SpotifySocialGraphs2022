LOVE ISN’T REAL Lyrics[Intro]
You always tell us you know (Oh)
Ooh, ooh (You always tell us you know)
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm standing next to nothing
You always act like you know how it feels
We used to stand for something
Now we've been acting like love isn't real
I'm standing next to someone
I always act like I know how it feels
You know you left me fucked up
Now I've been acting like love isn't real
[Post-Chorus]
Now I've been acting like
Now I've been acting like love isn't real
Now I've been acting like
Now I've been acting like love isn't—

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
But then you soaked up all my feelings then you left me on the shelf
And that was something I could manage, not with anybody's help
I know the reason that you left me is the reason that I felt remembered

[Refrain]
I don't wanna feel this pain (Feel this)
I don't wanna run away
I've been waiting for a change
Do you think we feel the same?

[Bridge]
Do you think we feel the same? (Feel the same)
Do you think we feel the...?

[Verse 2]
I won't let you let me down again
I've been looking for a friend
I don't wanna wait until the end, when I'm dead
I know you remember what I said
You can see my face inside your head
But I know that you'll pretend
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm standing next to nothing
You always act like you know how it feels
We used to stand for something
Now we've been acting like love isn't real

[Post-Chorus]
Now I've been acting like
Now we've been acting like love isn't real
Now I've been acting like
Now I've been acting like—

[Bridge]
Mm, mm
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Refrain]
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run away
I've been waiting for a change
Do you think we feel the same?

[Chorus]
I'm standing next to nothing
You always act like you know how it feels
We used to stand for something
Now we've been acting like love isn't real
You're standing next to someone
I always act like I know how it feels
You know you left me fucked up
Now I've been acting like love isn't real
[Outro]
(Now I've been acting like love isn't real)
I'm standing next to nothing
Oh, oh
We used to stand for something5Embed
