Chemical High Lyrics[Intro]
I told all my systems to go, go
You done made the room spin so slow, yeah

It's just a chemical high that I'm feeling
Love still burning in my brain (4x)

[Verse 1]
The smoke cloud is in full effect
Stoner raps I used to love to slap
Lately I've been growing up
I ain't slowing down, that shit's a trap
My cup, yeah, over runneth with
The ability to stomach it
Hollywood at half time
That whiteboy that's dunkin' it
Look how all the stars align
Precious moments when you get signed
But better when you get back up
Take it for yourself this time
These people they don't give a shit
They head bob, that's sucking dick
That same cat they fucking wit'
They'll drop his ass
They don't notice it
The don't give a shit
Are you serious?
You funny Eddie, delirious
You money team like Mayweather
Bet against us and then pay later
In a tent somewhere in Nor Cali
Where the green grow, maybe Mill Valley
I've been everywhere, I rep it all proudly
I got killers to, I can talk loudly
I was that kid when it got rowdy
I make a call, and now who clowning
Haha, there's two down
Now I gotta calm all the troops down
Peace keeping here for the evening
But an instigator since I was breathing
Just so I can see who means it
Itâ€™s entertainment they all dreamingYou might also like1Embed
