[Chorus:Wicca Phase Springs Eternal ]
Can you lift me up?
Now and by the wings?
I’ll hold you in my hands
I feel it start to rain
Can you lift me up?
Before I hit the trail of trouble
I see you with your grace and confidence
Can you see me all my double?
[Verse 1: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
We can be the same
You folded into me
I feel you in the dark
Highway in the night
Straight down to the beach
On another plane
You stare out and I see what you see
Emotion that I dare never name
The sentiment that hides in the trees
Full of pain, full of love
Fallen angel ascend
Let our love be the last
Shoot the legs, I attack
I’m a new kind of man
Maybe not even that
Full of charm, full of tact
From the mount take the back
In the back of the club
Put your hands in the air
To the trees in the dark
I’m the maximum star
And it’s all that I want
Two in total command
And it’s all that I want
Only her once again
You might also like[Verse 2: Døves]
I’m still in the back
I’ve still got my head in my hands
I think I lost track
I think I lost ten years of my life to this emptiness hollow and impermanent
I’ve been so low like my whole life
Can you lift me up? I’m just so tired
I’ve flown with broken wings since I was seventeen
On that highway in the night, straight to the beach
I can see in you what you can see in me
Can you lift me up?
Will you fly with me?

[Chorus: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal & (Døves)]
Can you lift me up? (Can you lift me up?)
Now and by the wings? (Now and by the wings?)
I’ll hold you in my hands (I’ll hold you in my hands)
I feel it start to rain (I feel it start to rain)
Can you lift me up? (Can you lift me up?)
Before I hit the trail of trouble
I see you with your grace and confidence
Can you see me all my double?1Embed
