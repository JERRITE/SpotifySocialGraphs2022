Translations한국어RomanizationONF - Sukhumvit Swimming (English Translation) LyricsI wanna fly to the south, look for a city that swallows the sun
I wanna meet you in the place that grows hotter once the moon rises

My days and my heart were so dry
They’re about to crack, help me, help me
I wanna get wet and messy
So shout out louder, shout shout

Jump into the long road, the channel to connect us
I’m right here
Swimming swimming swimming
Just arrived arrived arrived
I like it sukhumvit swimming
I feel alive la la alive
I like it sukhumvit swimming

Eh oh oh oh
Eh oh oh oh

Feels like I’m floating around this afternoon
When I close my eyes, I softly, softly, softly fall
Into the special dream that you built

I wanna fly to the south so I can find you, who has stolen the starlight
I wanna meet you, who shines even more when night comes

This song of the night won’t stop
This is our youth, youth youth

Jump into the long road, the channel to connect us
This is it, Bangkok
Swimming swimming swimming

Just arrived arrived arrived
I like it sukhumvit swimming
I feel alive la la alive
I like it sukhumvit swimming
You might also likeI dive in Sukhumvit and a swimming
Posing like a butterfly, I feel great
This place shines on us, squeeze
Let’s play with fluttering hearts
Like oh yeah this is our best spot

Just arrived arrived arrived
I like it sukhumvit swimming
I feel alive la la alive
I like it sukhumvit swimming

Eh oh oh oh
Eh oh oh ohEmbed
