Think of You Later (Empty Room) Lyrics[Verse 1]
This might be my last chance
So maybe i should take it
I just hope your listening
To everything i'm sayin
I miss the long drives, the car rides
The bad fights, the good times
The way you make me feel
Will never leave my mind

Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, i, will fall asleep alone
Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, i will fall asleep alone
So quit your cryin
And wipe the tears from your eyes
Cause this is see you later, i'm not into goodbyes
Watch the brake lights as i leave the driveway
The long nights will stay beside me
No matter where i go

Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, i, will fall asleep alone
Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, i, will fall asleep alone

Watch the brake lights as i leave the driveway
The long nights will stay beside me
No matter where i go

Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, i, will fall asleep alone
Think of you later in my empty room
Where i, where i, will fall asleep aloneYou might also likeEmbed
