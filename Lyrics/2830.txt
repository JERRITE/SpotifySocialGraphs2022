[Verse 1: Tobe Nwigwe]
I been broke like the U.S.A. government
Put my pipe in my wife right after the covenant
Pistol right by my side, contemplate dumpin' it
Only if a demon try schemin' or touchin' me
Ooh, yeah, big drip on me
Don't trip, might slip then hydroplane
Ooh, yeah, whole squad ball so hard
On God, might buy Rogaine
Ooh, yeah, how lil' buddy
Make it out the mud and still got his family intact?
Ooh, yeah, troublers
Might get your whole jaw buttoned up like a chinstrap
Ooh, every bar of praise a gift rap
Ooh, flow water, get a swim cap
Ooh, can't feel this, big cap
Low-key, I deserve big deal 'cause I been

Sound like the old Atlanta, got a pole in the Phantom
Codeine in an orange Fanta
Ain't goin' back to bein' broke no more
Eatin' shrimp, day shift with a pole dancer
Ambitious all my life
I serve fiends, manifestate my dreams
And an Asian made these jeans
Euros in my pocket
Shout out my amigo, he the socket, yeah
Flow like epoxy (Poppin')
I'm talkin' German engineerin'
African-American, I need some therapy
I just need someone to listen (Someone to listen)
Came with the D like a Piston
She make a wish in the Rolls-Royce 'cause stars in the ceilin' (Ceilin')
Who made it hard?
Swap EBT for cash like tradin' cards, yeah

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
H-Town Texan, always be investin'
Comin' through drippin' and saucin'
I'ma keep shinin' like Iceman Nick
Trae, Flip, Slim Thugga and Paul's grin
Ever heard 'em say that money talks? Yeah
I'm the one doin' the most talkin'
Rule number one is get money
Number two is get money, R.I.P. to Young Dolphin
Everything black on black, yeah
Amex, melanated dark skin
Y'all runnin' to the major label like you think they gon' save you
Who you think that is, Clark Kent?
I am not seven, not three
Not two, not eight, I'm nine above top ten
Could've been a one-hit wonder
You should wonder why I ain't in the situation, y'all in, uh
