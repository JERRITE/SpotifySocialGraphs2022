How Do You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You give me everything you've got
Everything you are, hey
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater
A mistreater, a deceiver
You must not know me
On my way to hell and I don't even care
I just blow trees
Nah, you must not know me
Ain't never been good to anybody
Man I will step up to anybody
Don't talk to me like you anybody, oh no
But I must admit it's something different
When I'm feeling your existence, oh Lord
And you make me wanna switch this
Way that I've been living, I don't get it
[Hook]
How do you love me?
Said the last time was the last time
How do you love me?
Knowing last time ain't the last time
How do you love me?
How do you love me?

[Verse 2]
Give me everything you've got
Everything you are
Oh, I'm a sinner, I'm a thief
All I ever gave was grief
You gave mercy
I need mercy
And I say again

[Hook]
How do you love me?
Said the last time was the last time
How do you love me?
Knowing last time ain't the last time

[Outro]
How do you love me?
