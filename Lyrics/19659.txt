Swallowa Lyrics[Intro: Just Juice]
I thought I wanted followers
But what I really want’s a Swallowa
(Oh boy, 3am)

[Pre-Chorus: Just Juice]
She left me now she want me to wallow her
I told her know her role, I just promoted her to swallower
I let her Tik Tok, she ticked 'cause I wouldn’t follow her
She started as a follower but now that chick a swallower
[Chorus: Just Juice]
Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a follower but now that chick a swallower
Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a fan but now that chick be a Swallowa

[Verse 1: Just Juice]
They say they take what want while homies take what they can
It ain’t nothin to replace her with money married to bands
Rose Tinted my Cartier’s, see me matchin' my brands
Only love me for my clout you ain’t a dime you ain’t a gram
You look perfect in makeup but you look better in nothing
Baby girl get your cake up and make that bread while we fuckin'
You felt worthless with everything, lost your purpose with nothing
Baby, prove that you grateful, tell me why I should trust it
Tryna break you down, break you down again
It’s nothing hoe
Tell me what you need from me, I’ll undercut, it’s nothing new
Why’d I let our love unfold, I should’ve kept us bottled up
Now my bed is broken and you walking with a model strut
A Swallowa

[Pre-Chorus: Just Juice]
She left me now she want me to wallow her
I told her know her role, I just promoted her to swallower
I let her Tik Tok, she ticked 'cause I wouldn’t follow her
She started as a follower but now that chick a swallower

Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a follower but now that chick a swallower
Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a fan but now that chick be a Swallowa

[Verse 2: Lil Tjay]
I don’t even know where I’m going
All I know is I’m just flowing
I’m running to bags
These niggas hating and I swear it’s so sad
My bad, these niggas mad but now I’m popping these tags
I got my dollars up
Money first, don’t care about no followers
Swallowa, I can turn your shorty to a Swallowa
She a fan, always tryna link me
I don’t bother her
If she try to thrive me more than once, I pass to Oliver
Big thuns, her shit 3D no binoculars
Got her thinking Imma blow a bag but I’ma pocket her
I ain’t playing games with these fuck girls
Everything change when you step in a thug’s world

[Pre-Chorus: Just Juice]
She left me now she want me to wallow her
I told her know her role, I just promoted her to swallower
I let her Tik Tok, she ticked 'cause I wouldn’t follow her
She started as a follower but now that chick a swallower
[Chorus: Just Juice]
Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a follower but now that chick a swallower
Swallowa, Swallowa
Turnt her to a Swallowa
Started as a fan but now that chick be a Swallowa

[Outro: Just Juice]
I thought I wanted followers
But what I really want’s a Swallowa1Embed
