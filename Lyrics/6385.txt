Back in the 90's Lyrics[Bridge]
Back in the nineties
I was in a very famous TV show (Ooh)
I'm BoJack the Horseman (BoJack)
BoJack the Horseman, don't act like you don't know

[Verse]
And I'm trying to hold onto my past
It's been so long, I don't think I'm gonna last
I guess I'm just trying to make you understand
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse
