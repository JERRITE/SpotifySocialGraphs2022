Fuck â€™Em Up Lyrics[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em up

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Got the four-four next to me, squeeze the trigger, make 'em bleed
MGP, my kidneys leak, gon' pop this flat and watch it peak
Rollin' and rollin', I swear I keep goin'
My money is growin', my bitches are foreign
My goonies they lurkin, [?] I'm swervin'
I'm curbin' these bitches, Buffet Boys, we blowin'
Always up, poppin' off, stupid ho, just shut it up
Opp he pop, we clappin' up
Downin' lean, I can't get up
Don't like you, we smashin' up
Call the plug, what happenin', bruh?
All my money stretchin' far, my Euro bitch with foreign cars
Thrash these streets, gon' shred the gnar
Gas bag, loud pack by the jar
Burning swishas, lungs got tar
My ego shinin' like a star
Everyone know who we are, my car real fast, it's NASCAR drivin'
She suck my dick, she swallow it
I kick her out, I won't commit
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em up

[Verse 2: Eddy Baker]
We gon' fuck shit up, hit 'em with a Falcon Punch
This ain't what he want, smash him like some Captain Crunch
Bitch I'm off the blunts, spark it and proceed to puff
Never been a chump, pussy, never been a punk
Goons like Captain Hook, bitch, you fuckin' with the crook
I will leave you shook, ass-whoopings, I wrote the book
When you flexin' how we flex, all the hoes gon' look
Yeah, I skeeted on her neck, I'ma fuckin' fool
I was trappin' at the school, never follow rules
A+ in the shop class, I was good with tools
I'm that nigga with a sack, who the fuck are you?
Put a nigga on his back if he lose his cool

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
We gon' fuck em up, we gon', we gon' fuck 'em up
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up
We gon', we gon' fuck em upYou might also likeEmbed
