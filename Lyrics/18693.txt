Sounds Good To Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll break my heart a thousand times
Can see it from miles away
It's gonna hurt, I'm gonna cry
When I walk home in the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
No one said it was easy
We'll be calling each other names
Making life a living hell
'Cause we gonna be jealous, selfish
Playing the dirty game
Fighting for the thrill of it
[Chorus]
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So why don't we get extra keys and bigger beds?
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So bring your jeans and old CD's, don't second guess

[Verse 2]
I let you down a thousand times
When I don't pick up the phone
You'll stay awake night after night
You've never felt so alone

[Pre-Chorus]
No one said it was easy
We'll be calling each other names
Making life a living hell
'Cause we gonna be jealous, selfish
Playing the dirty game
Fighting for the thrill of it

[Chorus]
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So why don't we get extra keys and bigger beds?
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So bring your jeans and old CD's, don't second guess
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me

[Bridge]
Won't you come on over stay the night?
Here by my side, yeah
I keep waiting for you, hold me tight
And we'll be alright

[Chorus]
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So why don't we get extra keys and bigger beds?
Sounds good to me, sounds good to me
So bring your jeans and old CD's, don't second guess

[Outro]
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
Sounds good to meEmbed
