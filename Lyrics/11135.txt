Travelling Light Lyrics[Verse 1: Stuart Staples]
There are places I don't remember
There are times and dates, they mean nothing to me
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
They don't serve to jog my memory

[Verse 2: Carla Torgerson]
I'm not waking in the morning, staring at the walls these days
I'm not getting out the boxes, spread out all over the floor
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
Those faces, they mean nothing to me no more
[Chorus 1: Stuart Staples & Carla Torgerson]
Hey, I travel light
You travel light
Everything I've done
You say you can justify, you travel light

[Verse 3: Stuart Staples & Carla Torgerson]
I can't pick them out, I can't put them in this sad old bag
Some things you have to lose along the way
When times are hard I'll only pick them out, wish I was going back
When times are good you'll be glad you ran away

[Chorus 1: Stuart Staples & Carla Torgerson]
Hey, I travel light
You travel light
Everything I've done
You say you can justify, you travel light

[Bridge: Stuart Staples, Carla Torgerson & both]
Do you remember how much you loved me?
You say you have no room in that thick old head
Well, it comes with the hurt and the guilt and the memories
If I had to take them with me I'd never get from my bed
But there's a crack in the roof where the rain pours through
That's the place you always decide to sit
Yeah I know I'm there for hours, the water running down my face
Do you really think you keep it all that well hid?

No, but I travel light
You don't travel light
Everything I've done
It's just a lie, you don't travel light

[Outro: Stuart Staples & Carla Torgerson]
I'm travelling light
No, you don't travel light
I travel light
No, no, you don't travel light
I'm travelling light
You don't travel light1Embed
