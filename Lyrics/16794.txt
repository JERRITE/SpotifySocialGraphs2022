Kiss from a Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

[Bridge]
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've (And if I should fall along the way) been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah (Yeah)
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

[Outro]
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray2Embed
