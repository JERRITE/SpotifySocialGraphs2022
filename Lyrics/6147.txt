Boys and Girls Lyrics[Chorus]
You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls

[Verse 1]
If the world turned dark and fell apart
You still have the love light in your heart
I hope you know it, I hope you know it
If the kids in charge try to burn our forest
I'll be outside congress throwing rocks
I hope you know it, I hope you know it
[Chorus]
You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah
You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah

[Verse 2]
And the sun will rise above and hit our doors
And we'll march out, we're moving forwards
Seen a brighter future's while we're moving towards
Let me hear your voice
'Cause when the stars align
We as the youth have to see the signs
Fill up the streets with our love and pride
The hatred will never survive, I hope you know

[Chorus]
You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah
You say we only boys and girls
I say we can change the world
The future lies within the boys and girls
The boys and girls, yeah

[Bridge]
We just want justice, are we really asking too much?
(We just want justice, to sit up in the house without 'em killin' us)
We just want to change the world and spread our love
(We just wanna- we just wanna paint the whole world but they paint us as a villain)
We just want justice, are we really asking too much?
(We just wanna- we just wanna live and laugh, make a wave like a flood)
We just want to change the world and spread our love
(We just wanna- We just wanna change the whole world and make love, we just want love.)

[Outro]
Love, spread our love (We just wanna spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Oh we just wanna spread our love)
Love, spread our love (We just wanna spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Oh we just wanna spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Spread our love)
Love, spread our love (Oh we just wanna spread our love)Embed
