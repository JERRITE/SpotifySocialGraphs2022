I Belong in Your Arms Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crossing my heart, open wide
You're my crystal and clover
All of me, honestly
Is dedicated to hold you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Swear to god, double knot
What would you do if I stole you tonight? (Ah ah)
Why waste time? (Ah ah)
[Chorus]
'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms

[Verse 2]
Feelings are good, nothing to say
Just want my head on your shoulder
Banana split, honestly
You're my remote controller, ah ah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Between you and me, suddenly
Something, something, something
Is on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes and no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms
You might also like[Bridge]
(Ay)
Woo!
(Ay)

[Chorus]
'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms

[Outro]
I belong
