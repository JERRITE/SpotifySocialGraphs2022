LV Smoke Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, super fly
Check the 'louers ('Louers)
Louis V check from the boot up (Boot up)
Get his thing, got to shoot them (Pew pew)
They playing two nights, got to root up
Treat me like a Louis connoisseur
Kick the game, now I got to suit up (Suit up)
Praying that the devil don't do us (Yeah)
Did he do us? (Aw)
[Verse 1]
Brand new whip but it's saying last year
Most y'all talk, I ain't seeing what I hear
Bought him the tape, I ain't talking about a kill
Quiet in the room but I'm standing right here
Came for the one, but she left for the three
I don't like the kill, but it came with a beat
Y'all be on the 'Gram with the shit going off
Then y'all get caught with the shit so it's off
The reef
That's why I ain't seen with them (Didn't see)
I don't even speak with them (Don't speak)
You better keep peace with them (Peace)
Or you ain't going to sleep for real (No sleep)
My niggas blow heat for real (Blow heat)
That shit can get deep for real (Get deep)
This shit for real

[Chorus]
Yeah, super fly
Check the 'louers ('Louers)
Louis V check from the boot up (Boot up)
Get his thing, got to shoot them (Pew pew)
They playing two nights, got to root up
Treat me like a Louis connoisseur
Kick the game, now I got to suit up (Suit up)
Praying that the devil don't do us (Yeah)
Did he do us? (Aw)

I ain't trying to talk, what you say bruh?
I ain't going to leave until I lay one
Brought her to the room, she was A1 (Yeah)
You ain't no boss, till you face one (Yeah)
Ain't as fly as me with a cape on (Yeah)
I ain't trying to die where I came from (Yeah)
She just want to fuck, that ain't really what I need
Talk like Jhene', but she looking like Rhi'
Ass, she a little freak (Freak)
Diamonds so sharp made me bleed (Yeah)
Shit ain't going to pop without me (Yeah)
Keep it a thou' with my cheese
I want the smoke
I ain't takin' no L's
I don't fuck with no L's
If you started with me
You going to die by yourself
Trey the one
Eight niggas know what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
Yeah, super fly
Check the 'louers ('Louers)
Louis V check from the boot up (Boot up)
Get his thing, got to shoot them (Pew pew)
They playing two nights, got to root up
Treat me like a Louis connoisseur
Kick the game, now I got to suit up (Suit up)
Praying that the devil don't do us (Yeah)
Did he do us? (Aw)3Embed
