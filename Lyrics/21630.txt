Wait Up For Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Leave on a light in the kitchen
Leave a little space in those sheets
I'll be home soon, stay there and listen
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
Open all the blinds and watch down the driveway
Wear your favorite shirt you stole from me
Chills running down my skin just thinking 'bout you
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
Hope you're pacing back and forth, up and down the highway
I'll be right there, I'm turning down your street
You come and get me smiling, been thinking 'bout it all day
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
[Chorus]
And when I get my hands on you
Do everything you want me to
You won't even have to spеak
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma keep you warm like a furnacе in the winter
You can cool me off like a summertime breeze
All I wanna do is wrap my arms around you
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
I even stopped off and bought you some roses
That's the kinda fool that you made me
I'm really crazy 'bout you, if you didn't notice
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me

[Chorus]
And when I get my hands on you
Do everything you want me to
You won't even have to speak
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me

[Outro]
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
Don't go to sleep, wait up for me
Don't go to sleep, wait up for meEmbed
