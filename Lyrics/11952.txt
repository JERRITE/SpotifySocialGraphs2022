One Kall Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, Uh, Uh, Woah
Woah, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
I got lean in my cup, sip the pain away
Put my feelings in the drank then I fade away
Smokin' Metro out the pound when I'm in LA
I just came to dick her down, that is not my bae
All it take is one call, get a nigga hit
You can't name one block that I won't spin
Double-back and go do it again
Hot-boxin' out the pound, I need some oxygen (Yeah)
[Verse]
Uh, beat a nigga ass, I flash out, don't touch me
Cameras 'round the crib, view 'em through the flatscreen
Killers bought an AP off some fake green
Hit 'em with that K, that makeover, Maybelline
Nigga, you ain't never made a bad bitch cream
Nigga, you ain't never pourеd a whole 16
Nigga, you ain't gotta drop 8's to get sleep
I got high on the bitch, I got hеr mad, we ain't link
Baby girl a demon, tryna suck me in my sleep
Young rich nigga, put Chanel on my feet
Keep a bad bitch, she keep her flaws on fleek
Blow her back out, now she don’t never want to leave

[Chorus]
I got lean in my cup, sip the pain away
Put my feelings in the drank then I fade away
Smokin' Metro out the pound when I'm in LA
I just came to dick her down, that is not my bae
All it take is one call, get a nigga hit
You can't name one block that I won't spin
Double-back and go do it again
Hot-boxin' out the pound, I need some oxygen (Yeah)
