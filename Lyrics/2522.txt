Tattoo (How â€™Bout You) Lyrics[Verse 1: Chance Perez]
Called you up this time, I thought I'd be your shelter
You left me standing at your door
Kept you off my mind last weekend, but it felt worse
Now I'm back outside once more

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos]
'Cause I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage, not on the floor
Something just pulled you away
Happened in front of my face, what's all of this for?
I'm still feeling the same
[Chorus: Sergio Calderon, with Brady Tutton]
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I'd hate to have to change this tattoo too
Yeah, I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh

[Verse 2: Brady Tutton &  Chance Perez]
Always seem to have a question for your answers
How could you act so carelessly? Ayy
Your reasons don't add up, you're such a little actor
So give you all my thoughts for free (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Ramos, with Chance Perez]
'Cause I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage, not on the floor
Something just pulled you away
Happened in front of my face, what's all of this for?
I'm still feeling the same
You might also like[Chorus: Sergio Calderon, with Brady Tutton & All]
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I'd hate to have to change this tattoo too
Yeah, I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day
Should've been up on the stage
How 'bout you, (how 'bout you?) you
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Conor]
I'm, cuttin' all my distractions
No tats 'cause, baby, I don't want no attachments
Maybe this is perfect and I'm overreacting
Or maybe I'm just missing something I haven't had yet
How 'bout you?
You really think that we could work together
But if it don't last, you're gonna hurt forever
You say maybe we should give it a chance, cancel our plans
I really hope that you understand, it's like

[Bridge: Sergio Calderon]
Called you up this time, I thought I'd be your shelter
You left me standing at your door
Kept you off my mind last weekend, but it felt worse
Now I'm back outside once more
[Chorus: Sergio Calderon & Drew Ramos & Brady Tutton & All]
How 'bout you, you?
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh
(I miss the stupid things that we do)
How 'bout you, you? (Ooh)
'Cause I'd hate to have to change this tattoo too (Have to change this tattoo)
Yeah, I like the rhythms you play
Melodies making me sway, wanted some more
We were the talk of the day (We were the talk of the day, oh)
Should've been up on the stage
How 'bout you (How 'bout you?), you? (How 'bout it?)
'Cause I miss the stupid things that we do, ooh (Ooh)4Embed
