Pistol Made of Bones Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was shot
By a Pistol made of bones
I got got
By bullets made of stones

[Chorus]
Oh the earth fueled the flame
But it was only me to blame
I was shot
By a Pistol made of bones
[Verse 2]
The shooter was
A mean and mighty ghost
Ooh yeah
He hated me
Because I loved him most

[Chorus]
The ones you should fear
Are often oh so near
I was shot
By a pistol made of bones

[Bridge]
Oh how could I be so blind?
But the gun was with me all the time

[Chorus]
The ones you should fear
Are often oh so near
I was shot
I was shot
By a pistol made of bonesYou might also like1Embed
