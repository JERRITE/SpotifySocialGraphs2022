12345SEX Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some call it insane
Say, "Baby, you're so vain"
But I'm living on overdrive, all the time
And I like the way you taste
Some liquor and a chaser
Flavor of forever just for the night

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is gettin' warmer, running outta air
But you can send me way up to the stratosphere
Tonight I'm feeling like a fucking billionaire
Not playing fair
Won't you come here
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
Cashing all my checks and telling lies
Might drive this car real fast until we die
One, two, three, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
One, two, three, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind

[Verse 2]
High on all the ways, you're whispering my name
Go play me like a game but just so you know
I'm obsessive with the chase
I'll come but never stay so
Turn me on and up just like radio

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is gettin' warmer, running outta air
But you can send me way up to the stratosphere
Tonight I'm feeling like a fucking billionaire
Not playing fair
Won't you come here

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
Cashing all my checks and telling lies
Might drive this car real fast until we die
One, two, three, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
(One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind)
Cashing all my checks and telling lies
Might drive this car real fast until we die (Until we die)
One, two, three, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind (Yeah, one, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind)
Cashing all my checks and telling lies
Might drive this car real fast until we die (Drive this car real fast until we die)
One, two, three, four, five, six (Yeah)
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
You might also like[Outro]
One, two, three, four, five, sex on my mind
