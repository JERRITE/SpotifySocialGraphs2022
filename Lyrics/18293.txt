OHFR? Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch
Hah

[Chorus]
Oh, for real?
They said Rico put a ten piece in her grill
I been movin' how I want, fuck how you feel
I was told to get how you live
Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? (Yeah)
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I was taught to feel how I feel, keep it real
Diamonds wet, they shockin' bitches, neckpiece like an eel
Niggas said I'm actin' different since I got a deal
I just think I'm eatin' different, more food for the meal
No more Happy Meals, just champagne cheers
I used to not have fans, now I fill up fields
Bought a new housе, but I need me a buildin'
I can't stop until I'm makin' me a billion
No Aminé, we reel in
Any bitchеs fishin' and seekin' out for attention
Geekin' in the mentions
Please don't make me have to smack a bitch
Ooh, I been itchin' (Lil' bitch)

[Chorus]
Oh, for real?
They said Rico put a ten piece in her grill
I been movin' how I want, fuck how you feel
I was told to get how you live
Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? (Yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm making money smoothies, blend it up, I'm steady mixin'
Like I got the ball, go to the mall and they steady blitzing
They wanting pictures and they wanna know just how I'm living
What I make a show vs. you is a big digit difference
I do the same thing that you do, it's just with me, they feel it
Oh, you mad that you can't hurt my pockets or my feelings?
When I ask you what the issue is, you hard of hearing
I been sinnin' lately, but I'm still God-fearing
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, for real?
They said Rico put a ten piece in her grill
I been movin' how I want, fuck how you feel
I was told to get how you live
Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? (Yeah)
