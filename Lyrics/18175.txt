Nothing’s All The Time Lyrics[Intro]
(Nothing's all the time)

[Verse 1]
I'm in my bed, spent a couple days now
Up in my head, and I can't seem to crawl out
Thought on my meds, I'd never have another fall down
Another cold ground, but

[Pre-Chorus]
Good things never last, and neither do the bad things
Easy saying that, but never when it's happening
Happy or I'm sad, it all feels everlasting
Always when it's happening
[Chorus]
Pull me out, pull me out, of this state of mind
Hold me down, hold me down, 'til I realize
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing's all the time
(Nothing's, nothing's)
Nothing's all the time

[Verse 2]
A couple drinks, ten minutes 'til midnight
No, we won't sleep, we stay up 'til the sunrise
Don't wanna blink, I wanna stay here my whole life
Feels so right, but

[Pre-Chorus]
Good things never last, and neither do the bad things
Easy saying that, but never when it's happening
Happy or I'm sad, it all feels everlasting
Always when it's happening

[Chorus]
Pull me out, pull me out, of this state of mind
Hold me down, hold me down, 'til I realize
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing's all the time
Nothing's all the time
(Nothing's, nothing's)
So when it feels like I won't, make it out alive
Just remind me of all, the storms I survived
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing's all the time
(Nothing's, nothing's)
Nothing's all the time

Pull me out, pull me out (Out)
Hold me down, hold me down (Down)
Pull me out, pull me out (Out)
Hold me down, hold me down

[Chorus]
Pull me out, pull me out, of this state of mind
Hold me down, hold me down, 'til I realize
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts all the time
Nothing's all the time
(Nothing's, nothing's)
So when it feels like I won't, make it out alive
Just remind me of all, the storms I survived
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing's all the time
Nothing's all the time

[Outro]
(Nothing's, nothing's)Embed
