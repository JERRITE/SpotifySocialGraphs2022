That Was Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yesterday I had nothing
Didn't know whether I've amount to something
I had holes in my shoes and in my clothes
Only yesterday
I was just a boy living amongst children
A mini guitar that I could play with
I would pretend that anything could happen
That was yesterday

[Chorus]
That was yesterday
That was yesterday
No matter how far I've come
Still know where I'm from, oh
Never let it slip away
Still trying to figure out
What the game is all about, oh
So I take it day by day by day
[Verse 2]
Yesterday no one was listening
Today it's gonna be different
They couldn't hear my voice under the suffering
That was yesterday
Yesterday I had no direction
In my mind I had nothing but questions
I could've never dreamed of what would happen
That was yesterday

[Chorus]
That was yesterday
That was yesterday
No matter how far I've far come
Still know where I'm from, oh
Never let it slip away
Still trying to figure out
What the game is all about, oh
So I take it day by day by day

[Verse 3]
Yesterday I was hoping
Today the future's wide open
I was lost and the signs in my mind
That was yesterday

[Bridge]
That was yesterday
That was yesterday
That was yesterday, oh
That was yesterday
That was yesterday
That was yesterdayEmbed
