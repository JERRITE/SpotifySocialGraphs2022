Think of Me Tonight Lyrics[Intro]
I miss your room
I miss everything about everything you do
I could never forget a face like you
I'll feel better if I know that you'll think of me tonight
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I used to call when you were crying
But now you're crying on the floor
I can tell that there's something so wrong, baby
I know I said things would be different
But now you're walking out the door
I take it all back, oh no, come back, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Can I say something to change your mind?
Can I do something to make it right?

[Chorus]
I miss your room (Say you'll come back, baby)
I miss everything about everything you do
I could never forget a face likе you
I'll feel better if I know that you'll think of me tonight

[Verse 2]
I know you told mе not to call you
So I've been staring at my phone
I wanna tell you that I was so wrong, baby
And I don't got no one to talk to
So I been sitting here alone
I take it all back, oh no, come back, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I say something to change your mind?
Can I do something to make it right?

[Chorus]
I miss your room (Say you'll come back, baby)
I miss everything about everything you do
I could never forget a face like you
I'll feel better if I know that you'll think of me tonight

You live in my head again and again, forever and ever
To never forget the things that we said, forever and ever
You live in my head again and again, forever and ever
To never forget the things that we said, forever and ever

[Chorus]
I miss your room (Say you'll come back, baby)
I miss everything about everything you do
I could never forget a face like you
I'll feel better if I know that you'll think of me tonight5Embed
