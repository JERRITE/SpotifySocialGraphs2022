Hang On, Hang On Lyrics[Verse 1]
We never left you
We never left you that day
We never left you
Even though you fell far away
Couldn't hold you
But you didn't wanna be here anyway

[Chorus 1]
So hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
'Cause you already come so far along
[Verse 2]
We never failed you
Even though you might've felt that way
We never left you
Hard to see you in so much pain
And I would've stayed there forever
But it didn't work out that way

[Chorus 2]
So hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
When morning comes you won't be here alone

[Bridge]
Say you love us, babe
A lover's prayer is all we know
Say you love us, babe
As we standin' there in the shadow and stone
Say you love us, babe
A lover's prayer is all we've know
Say you love us, babe

[Chorus 2]
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
When morning comes you won't be here alone
When morning comes you won't be here alone
When morning comes you won't be here aloneYou might also likeEmbed
