Ignorance Ain’t Bliss LyricsBreaking down the barrier
They just wanna bury you
Thinking that you know it all
I don't know what’s scarier
Ignorance ain’t bliss
Kill em wit a kiss
People putting poison in their kids
I don't miss
Hollow tip to the soul
Control is their goal
Heaven is the destination
I just wanna go
Found me in a hole
I just wanna grow
Something like a flower full bloom thru the snow
Water me with tears
Wash away my fears
Wandered thru the desert
Been in the wilderness for years
Hide me from the flames
Burn away the pain
All the times I failеd
You always stayed the same
I’m forеver grateful
Drop the weight of hate
No I could never pay you back
That’s why you my saviour
I been doing fine
You always on my mind
I just need to hear your voice one time
Made a choice one time...You might also likeEmbed
