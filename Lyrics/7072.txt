Be the One (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Sinéad Harnett]
Rollin' for days now
Clouds in my head
How you turn all the noise down?
Weight off my chest

[Pre-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
When I thought it was improbable
’Cause of all of the others before
But you do something I've never known
It compels me to bare you my soul
[Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one, ooh

[Verse 2: Sinéad Harnett]
Only one choice now
Just to let us be
'Cause I treasure the way you calm me down
How you set me free

[Pre-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
When I thought it was impossible
’Cause of all of the fuckers before
But you're different, you're good to the bone
It compels me to bare you my soul

[Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
I wanna be the one, ooh (Be the one)

[Verse 3: Col3trane]
Yeah, dreamin' and drivin' through sunsets with you
Yeah, in your dirty Jeep, off to Malibu
A blondie and her eyes blue as the sky
And Blonde be the only CD in the drive
So Frank gon' be the vibe, I'm with you, that's just fine
You look in my eyes soon as I grab hold of your thigh
And I ain’t gon’ act surprised that I knew you'd be the one
So won’t you say it baby? I love to hear you say that
You might also like[Chorus: Sinéad Harnett, Col3trane, Both]
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
Whoa, whoa, oh
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
Said I wanna be the one
I wanna be the one (Be the one)
Whoa, whoa, oh
I wanna be the one, ooh (Be the one)
I wanna be the, I wanna be the one babe, yeah

[Outro: Sinéad Harnett]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ohEmbed
