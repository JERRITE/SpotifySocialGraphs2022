Driving at Night LyricsIt's cold tonight but I ain't shy
Let's get inside and run away with love
I don't know where I'd rather be
City lights, the boys still fight
It breaks out onto the streets but they're alright
I don't know where I'd rather be

Passersby, have you got a light?
I haven't, mate, but why don't you ask that guy?
I don't know where I'd rather be
It's always been a battle between
Thinking and feeling, the bullring is freezing
And there is no meaning to any of this
I know where I'd rather be
Driving out to a place that you don't know
It won't ever be the same as home
Driving out to a place that you don't know
It won't ever be the same as home
Driving out to a place that you don't know
It won't ever be the same as home

I'm thinking, I'm feeling
I don't know where I'd rather be
I'm thinking, I'm feeling
There's nowhere I'd rather be
(Driving out to a place that you don't know)
I'm thinking, I'm feeling, I'm thinking, I'm feeling
(Driving out to a place that you don't know)
I know where I'd rather be
(Driving out to a place that you don't know)
I'm thinking, I'm feeling, I'm thinking, I'm feeling
(Driving out to a place that you don't know)
I know where I'd rather beYou might also likeEmbed
