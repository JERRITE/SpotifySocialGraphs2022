I Turn To You - Hex Hector Radio Mix Lyrics[Intro]
You.....
You.....

[Verse 1]
When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

[Chorus]
I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
[Verse 2]
When my insides are wracked with anxiety
You have the touch that will quiet me
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice
When I need inspiration, when I need advice

[Chorus]
I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you

[Bridge]
Where would I be? What would I do?
If you'd never helped me through
I hope someday if you've lost your way
You could turn to me, like I turn to you

[Chorus]
I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you
When fear tells me to turn around
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you.....You might also like1Embed
