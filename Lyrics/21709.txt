Steady Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hit me like the big bang
Raining like a flash flood
Through me like a hurricane
Now I got you in my blood

[Pre-Chorus]
What if all I ever knew was life without you?
Then I would have nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Where the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides
And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life
[Verse 2]
I've been to the other side
Images I've never seen
Technicolor, real life
Baby, what you do to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
What if all I ever knew was life without you
And I would have nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Where the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides
And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life

[Bridge]
I'll be your lifeline
I'll be the first to jump in
There ain't no current strong enough to hold me back
I'll pull you up from
From the wreckage
Just know that I'm never giving up, never giving up
Oh no, ooh
Oh, yeah
You might also like[Hook]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Where the ocean meets the sky
Lay shadows on the crimson tide
I'm gonna give you steady love
And love you 'til the storm subsides
And when the water fills your lungs
And your soul begins to die
I'm gonna give you steady love
I'm gonna bring you back to life3Embed
