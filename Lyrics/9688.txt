Ma poking and ticklish, it comes to life
Peaches the sweetest, the creamiest taste for love
It makes you sweep and licky get them better
Chocolate kisses, vanilla thighs
Just what it takes to get in your mind
Ticking with tongue, addicted to taste
Cinnamon lemon, a dozen to try

If you want I could be more
Turning it anyway you want (Anyway you want it)
You could be mine, some of the time
And I could be yours the rest of the time
And we could be lovers (We could be lovers)
