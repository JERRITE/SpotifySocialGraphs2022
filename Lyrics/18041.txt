TranslationsEspañolPancakes for Dinner Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna cross a line
But if I were to crash in this plane tonight
I'd want you to know this

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna say too much
Intrude on your space
But if I were to crash and I never made it home
I'd want you to know this
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
And I wish that you could hear me
When I talk to myself
But this plane might not land safely
So what the hell do I have to lose?
If I just tell you

[Chorus]
I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her, I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester
And what was that song about?
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I'll just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now?

[Chorus]
I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

[Outro]
Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead4Embed
