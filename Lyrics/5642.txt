Wildfire Lyrics[Intro: Yukimi Nagano]
Ah-ah

[Verse: Yukimi Nagano]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to set the alarm 'cause of the thrills that run up my back
You are my star, nothing else can lead me off track

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano & SBTRKT]
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat

I could bet all the riches that I ever had

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano & SBTRKT]
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire

Your innocence, who's brave?

It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat

Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
