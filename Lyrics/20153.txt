​​​​died and came back to life Lyrics[Intro: fats'e]
Life goes on
Can't say I didn't try
Just not hard enough
Found a new timeline
Just tossed to the side
Died and came back to life

[Verse 1: heylog]
You're across the states, I wish it wasn't the truth
It's either them or me, now you're gone, you had to choose
So I gave you a piece of art I took time and drew
You can keep it forever, I hope it stays with you
You've got so much ahead of you and goals to accomplish
While I make a song saying "Log, you need to top this"
But god I'm tired and the struggle is real
I died and came back to life, now I can't feel
[Chorus: fats'e]
Life goes on
Can't say I didn't try
Just not hard enough
Found a new timeline
Just tossed to the side
Died and came back to life
Life goes on
Can't say I didn't try
Just not hard enough
Found a new timeline
Just tossed to the side
Died and came back to life

[Post-Chorus: fats'e & heylog]
We both come undone
Feeling stuck in a loop
That I can't seem to outrun
Feeling stuck in a loop, can't escape

[Verse 2: Lil Skele]
And God, I'd love to talk but look just not right now
Got some shit to say, I just don't know how
Spent every night alone just fucking dreaming of you
And love, I know you're hurting, it kills me too
And tell me why it always gets so hard
Getting out of bed feels like I'm heading to war
And if I saw the reaper know he'd take me for sure
Breaking down alone, I put my head to the door
I don't get it, I thought I was better
You said it so why can't I remember?
I'm sick of living like this, I hate the medicine
I'm sick of crying like this, it never fucking ends
At this point, think I've died twice
Really good at fucking up my life
And I don't care if you love me
I just need you to lie
Life goes on, I just don't wanna try
I got used to all the pain inside

Life goes on
Can't say I didn't try
Just not hard enough
Found a new timeline
Just tossed to the side
Died and came back to life
Life goes on
Can't say I didn't try
Just not hard enough
Found a new timeline
Just tossed to the side
Died and came back to life

[Post-Chorus: fats'e & heylog]
We both come undone
Feeling stuck in a loop
That I can't seem to outrun
Feeling stuck in a loop, can't escape

[Outro: fats'e]
We both come undone
Feeling stuck in a loop1Embed
