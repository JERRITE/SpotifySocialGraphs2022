I Know I’m Funny haha Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's sit around and drink some saké
Then we can argue 'bout the same things
Talk about neighbors on our front porch
I wonder if they know we're moving
Hope they don't know my landlord personally
'Cause I never told him you moved in with me
But fuck him, he kept my money

[Verse 2]
I think your sisters are so pretty
Got drunk and they forgot they met me
I made her laugh one time at dinner
She said I'm funny and then I thanked her
But I know I'm funny haha
[Verse 3]
We go through phases when we're over ours
Right now we both wanna be rockstars
Got you a bass last year on your birthday
The same one the guy from Linkin Park plays
But you look better with it anywaysYou might also like3Embed
