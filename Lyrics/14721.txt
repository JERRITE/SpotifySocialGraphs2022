Lick Ya Down Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, whoa-oh

[Verse 1]
Why, the lights on
You said, said you were out
You did gone
Yeah you did left, but now
I'm on your lawn, I could tell that
There was something wrong
What's goin' on?
Saw a silhouette, oh no, no
I smell a cigarette - you don't smoke
Well, well, I guess you're home
You dead gone
Now you gon' get it out
Get-get, get-get it, get it
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you flip the switch
You gon' wish you never did this
I'ma flip the script
Put you, put you on my hit list
Who you think this is?
You know I'm about my business
What you think this is?
You know I'm about my business

[Chorus]
You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down

You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down

Now I'm your ex
I'ma put you on blast on the Internet
No regrets, no doubt, I'm over it
But before I'm out I'ma make you sweat
Make, make you sweat, sweat

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you flip the switch
You gon' wish you never did this
I'ma flip the script
Put you, put you on my hit list
Who you think this is?
You know I'm about my business
What you think this is?
You know I'm about my business

[Chorus]
You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down

[Verse 3]
Girl, I know I did you wrong
Played you like a fool
Please don't hold a grudge this long
When you gon' be cool?
Girl, you know me, now I want you back
Feeling like a fool
When can we be cool?
'Cause I'm feeling like a fool
Girl, I know I did you wrong
Played you like a fool
Please don't hold a grudge this long
When you gon' be cool?
Girl, you know me, now I want you back
Feeling like a fool
When can we be cool?
'Cause I'm feeling like a fool

[Bridge]
Cha dread, cha dread
Cha dread, cha dread

[Chorus]
You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down

You don't know me
Boy you can't run away
Oh please, gon' find you anyway
I'ma lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, down
Lick ya, lick ya down
Lick ya, lick ya down, downEmbed
