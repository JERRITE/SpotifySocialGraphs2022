Iâ€™ll Have to Say I Love You in a Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I got to say can't wait
I know you'd understand

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say "I love you" in a song
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know it's kind of strange
But every time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say "I love you" in a song

[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time the time was right
All the words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say "I love you" in a song

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know it's kinda late (it's kinda late)
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just got to say
(I know you'd understand)
I know you'd understand

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say "I love you" in a songYou might also like5Embed
