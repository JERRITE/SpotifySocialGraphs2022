Always Where I Need to Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
She don't know who she is
Oh, I can take her anywhere
Do whatever comes naturally to you
You know she just don't care
You know she just don't care

[Chorus]
Because I am always where I need to be
And I always thought I would end up with you eventually
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
[Verse 2]
And now I see her again
I ask to be her hummingbird
Whisper words in her ear
Oh, now you know I just don't care
You know she just don't care

[Chorus]
Because I am always where I need to be
And I always thought I would end up with you eventually
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do

[Bridge]
I'm a man, I'm a man, oh, oh, I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man and I can be so obscene

[Chorus]
Because I always think that I know how to be
But I always thought I would end up with you eventually
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do

[Outro]
I'm a man, I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, I'm a man, I can be so obsceneYou might also like6Embed
