Vvolvo Lyrics[Intro]
Beautiful

[Chorus]
Riding in my Volvo today
Going where? I really don't know
Riding in my Volvo today
With you or solo

[Verse]
If you wanna roll sometime
You can come and ride with me
I been on the road lately
Drivin' 'round in 180
Baby, you can come and see
[Chorus]
Riding in my Volvo today
Going where? I really don't know, uh
Riding in my Volvo today
With you or solo
Riding in my Volvo today
Going where? I really don't know
Riding in my Volvo today
With you or solo

[Bridge]
Call it when I see it (Yeah, yeah)
So fast, can't believe it (Uh, uh)
Faster shit, don't need it (Yeah, yeah)
I'll be riding in my Volvo (Huh, huh)
