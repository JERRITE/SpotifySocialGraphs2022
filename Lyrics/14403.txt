I Don’t Love Anyone (But You’re Not Just Anyone) Lyrics[Verse 1]

I don't love anyone, but you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

I don't love anyone, but you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

[Chorus]

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger thumb a wish
You live this way, and oh I'll never leave (the outside world, it seems so cold)
[Verse 2]

I don't love anyone, but you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

The luck a penny brings, means everything
When you kiss and cross superstitiously-aly-aly-aly

[Chorus]

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger thumb a wish
You live this way, and oh I'll never leave (the other world, seems just so cold)

[Bridge]

Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah
Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah
Johnny comes marching home again, with this and that and a big bass drum
And they all come marching, over the hill from war

[Verse 2]

Well I don't love anyone, oh you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me
You might also likeThe luck a penny brings, means everything
When you kiss and cross superstitiously

[Chorus]

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger thumb a wish
You live this way, and oh you'll never leave (the other world, it's just so cold)Embed
