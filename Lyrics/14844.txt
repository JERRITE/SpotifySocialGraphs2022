Trippinâ€™ on a Hole in a Paper Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dying anyway
Take a look at Eiffel towers
Never trust them dirty liars
Sipping lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on tripping anyway

[Chorus 1]
I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade
[Verse 2]
Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life, Vicks vapor life
And when you binge, I purge alike, let go
It's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper, I'll be gone
Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose

[Chorus 2]
I am, I am I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer, Let me go
Let me be, just let me be

[Chorus 1]
I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade

I am, I am I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer, let me go
Let me be, just let me be

[Chorus 1]
I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade7Embed
