THE TASTE Lyrics[Intro]
We looking for some weed
If there's some weed, good weed?
Where is the motherfuckin' weed?
I'm from the motherfuckin' Chi-town where the bodies drown
We don't motherfuckin' play
Period

[Verse 1: VIC MENSA]
Girl, you sweeter than a Baba's lemonade
Right when the sun's 'bout to fade
We could make up at The Rink on 87th Street
Maybe one time let's couple skate
We could light up the night, like it's the Fourth of July
Let's go to Navy Pier (Navy Pier)
Ring me like Bеars '85, I'm running back every time
Girl, I'll bе your sweetness (Your sweetness)
[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
You taste like Chicago
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
Rollin' up something good, smokin' on hay
You taste like Chicago
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
Them Fours, them Fives, them Six, them Trey
Stay focused 'cause they gangbang all day

[Verse 2: VIC MENSA]
Jukin' on the weekend, had me tweakin' in yo' Baby Phat
Yeah, we both is grown now but girl, I still bounce and break your bed
Phasin' in a basement to that Chris Brown, let me take you down
My cousins is from Gary, we up early when they came in town
Hit up ford city, just to get some ones we up at River Oaks
If a nigga got yo fitted broke
Switch your hat they'll think you're Folkz
Movin' through the city like CTA
We was riding steamers like GTA
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
When the streets lights come on will you run away with me?
And when we ride Lake Shore Drive, it feel like we on LSD

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
You taste like Chicago
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
Rollin' up something good, smokin' on hay
You taste like Chicago
Summertime, summertime, summertime, hey
Them Fours, them Fives, them Six, them Trey
Stay focused 'cause they gangbang all day

Bounce then break yo back
Bounce then break yo back
Bounce then break yo back
You bounce so hard you break yo back, girl
Bounce then break yo back

You bounce so hard you break yo back, girl
Bounce then break yo back (Jukin' on the weekend)
Bounce then break yo back (J-j-jukin' on the weekend)
Bounce then break yo back
You bounce so hard you break your back, girl

[Outro: VIC MENSA]
Shorty give me a sign
When you wanna be satisfied
Shorty, I need to know
How far you're willing to go
Shorty, if I can be
Your freakiest fantasy, girl
I promise that I can do
What it takes to make you (Cum, cum) baby, yeahEmbed
