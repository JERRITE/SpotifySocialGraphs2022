Problem with You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Was I cold?
Went to hold you, but I wanted to control you
Paranoid
What's wrong with me?
Why am I pointing out everything wrong with you?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let's talk about last night, who were you with?
Why didn't you answer me?
All of these questions, criticizing
You bring out the worst in me
[Chorus]
The problem with you is
That I can't get you off my mind
And I think about you all the time
It's your fault that I don't feel right
The problem with you is
That you're all that I dream about
And you're not right here right now
Took a minute, but I figured it out
The problem with me is you
Oh no, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
When we met
I was careless with all of my emotions
But the closer we'd get
I became more attentive, more protective, more aggressive

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's talk about last night, you went to sleep
Didn't even talk to me
You left me with questions, agonizing
You bring out the worst in me

[Chorus]
The problem with you is
That I can't get you off my mind
And I think about you all the time
It's your fault that I don't feel right
The problem with you is
That you're all that I dream about
And you're not right here right now
Took a minute, but I figured it out
The problem with me is you

Now I understand why I feel this way
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed
Now I understand why I feel this way
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed
The problem with me is you
Now I understand why I feel this way (With me is you)
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed (Ooh, it's you)
Now I understand why I feel this way (You)
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed

[Chorus]
The problem with you is
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time
The problem with you is
You're all I dream about
And you're not right here right now
I figured it out, the problem with me is you3Embed
