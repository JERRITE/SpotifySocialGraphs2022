Just For You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Morning brings me mental
What's the story? Run my head through
Draw up a mind map, set for central
Followed a blind man
'Cause we felt the need to move right now

[Verse 2]
For the glory, on and onwards
Hear the roaring growing stronger
We're on a shine, man, and we're dreadful
Turned on a wise land
'Cause we felt the need to move right now
And we never bring each other to the ground
(One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
And yeah, we'll come for you
Yeah, we'll come, and
Come just for you

[Verse 3]
Yes, our timing will be crucial
We're not blinded, speaking truthful
Forever grinding with our people
Watching wisely, we're only equal

[Bridge]
Somewhere we belong
Until then, carry on
Somewhere we belong
Until then, carry on
(One, two, three, four)

Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
And yeah, we'll come for you
Yeah, we'll come, and
Come just for you
(One, two, three, four)
Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Sun is always shining
It's there, it's there, it's there
And yeah, we'll come just for you
Let this world define me
And yeah, we'll come for you
Yeah, we'll come, and
Come just for you
[Outro]
Just for you
