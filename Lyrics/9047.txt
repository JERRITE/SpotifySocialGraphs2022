Arc of a Diver LyricsShe bathes me in sweetness I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams, I need my woman
This humble expression meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean it has no meaning
But jealous night and all her secret chords
I must be deaf, on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano, no more running, honey

This time to the sky, I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry, and even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Arc of a diver, effortlessly
My mind in sky and when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime, I feel you near
Warm water breathing, she helps me here

But jealous night and all her secret chords
I must be deaf, on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky, I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry, and even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer because with you I'm stronger

But jealous night and all her secret chords
I must be deaf, on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky, I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry, and even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer because with you I'm stronger

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Lean streaky music spawned on the streets
I hear it, but with you I had to go
'Cause my rock 'n' roll is putting on weight
And the beat, it goes on

My mind in sky, and when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime, I feel you near
Warm water breathing, she helps me here

But jealous night and all her secret chords
I must be deaf, on the telephone
I need my love to translate

With you my love
We're gonna raid the future
With you my love
We're gonna stick up the past
We'll hold today to ransom
'Til our quartz clock stop
Until yesterday
Whoa, until yesterday
Until yesterday
'Til our quartz clock stopEmbed
