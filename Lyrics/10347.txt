All I Got Lyrics[Verse 1: Hendersin]
Yeah, we going in again; this is that intrusion
Spending like we got them ends, this is that conclusion
You should bring your friend again, I find that shit amusing
Take a shot; you see it, now you don'tâ€”that's the illusion
Yeah, I'm packing clubs, best believe I'm on my caddy flow
I guess that it's apparent, even yo mom and yo daddy know
That I put on that dope show, show 'em just what Manson 'bout
And they rooting for the kid, that's because I'm branching out
Gotta keep it moving, sorry baby, I don't like to wait
I'm hungry and I'm driven, can you please get me a license plate?
Girl be feelin' it, they killin' it, I see them dead chicks
Got that money, they stick to you, yeah, I guess that bread sticks
Nigga got a vision, I don't think you see it well
Over when the fat lady sings, do you see Adele?
I am young and I am reckless, plus I'm hung just like a necklace
Go against me and you're screwed, so Texas, ahhh
[Hook]
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take (give and take)
But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake (possible mistake)
Life is not what it seems, just a kid with a dream
I'ma do it till the day that I die, I
Pour them bottles up 'cause we don't give a fuck
Get a drink and throw it in the sky, I
You can be mad, but it's "Fuck what you had"
'Cause I'm coming and I'm taking your spot, I
Never gon' quit, middle fingers what they get
Let them know I give it all I got, I

[Verse 2: Hendersin]
Uh, I got' em quoting verses, got 'em saying, "My god"
Book them shows, the only gigs you got is on your iPod
You are often mad and you talking 'bout your swag
Only label that's behind you is a motherfucking tag
And I been grinding steady, so when the timing is ready
Don't bring them funny verses, I ain't talking bout Mazzetti
I'm reaching for the throne 'cause I know that you can't stand me
And a nigga never idle, and you looking like Randy
Plan b, nah, this my chance to be in a record books
They say what comes around goes around, tell me how this record looks
'Cause once it gets 180, that's the day they gonna pay me
'Cause I been paying these dues and it's been driving me crazy
So let's just make a toast and let's just get a buzz
Saying "Hi" to what we'll be, saying "Bye" to what we was
And if I'm gonna make it, we'll see
But I guarantee that you should focus on me, me
