No Oneâ€™s Here To Sleep Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every carpet, every floor
Everywhere I look, I fall
Climbing up the walls
I'm climbing up the walls
What goes on behind these doors
I'll keep mine and you'll keep yours
We all have our secrets
We all have our secrets

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind every door
Is a fall, a fall and
No one's here to sleep
[Chorus]
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me
And you were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me

[Verse 2]
Here's the pride before the fall
Oh, your eyes, they show it all
I can see it coming
I can see it coming
As I rise up through each floor
Shit gets dark and you lose it all
I can hear it coming
I can hear the drumming

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind every door
Is a fall, a fall and
No one's here to sleep

[Chorus]
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me
And you were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me
You might also like[Chorus]
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me
And you were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me

(You were always faster than me
I will always catch up with you)12Embed
