I Came for Blood Lyrics[Verse 1]
The bloody nose of victory
Fueled by seeds of hate
Make peace with my enemies?
No chance, not today
I've traveled through the unknown
That is where I thrive
You chose to say my name aloud
So I shall never die

[Pre-Chorus]
You can’t break me down
For my time is now
I will make you see
This battle is not an option
It's part of who is me
[Chorus]
I, I came for blood
My one desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is driving me

[Verse 2]
A battered soul for destiny
I know I'll pull through
No one here can stop me
Not him, not her, not you
I’ve watched your body wither
Your courage turn to dust
I'll rise to fight another day
On that you can trust

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't break me down
For my time is now
I will make you see
This battle is not an option
It's part of who is me

[Chorus]
I, I came for blood
It's my desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is driving me
I, I came for blood
My one desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is driving me
It's driving me

[Chorus]
I came for blood
It's my desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is driving me
I, I came for blood
It's my desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is driving me
I, I came for blood
It’s my desire
I will get what I need
I, I came for blood
My one desire
Is to make you
Make you bleedEmbed
