60 Seconds Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blocked in my driveway by two cars
Uber's running hella late, that's two stars
Got a session in North Hollywood, that's too far
This day's not off to a good start
Phone's blowing up like hot air balloon
It's like my friends really don't think I got shit to do
Got a album on the way, I'm a busy dude
Now I know why CEO's drinking at noon

[Chorus]
You're going on and on, asking favors
Damn, now my time's stolen
I wanna help, swear I got the best intentions
But right now, I need a moment
I need a minute to myself (I need that minute, minute)
I need a minute to myself (No, no, no, no, no, no)
[Verse 2]
Afternoon and I'm feeling zombie
Swear I'm moving too slow, I'm too sloppy
Tryna find some patience like the Lord taught me
Eyes barely open, man, I need some coffee
So I pull up to the shop on the corner
There's no line, I walk straight in and I order
I get my drink, turn around and hit the door when
Somebody stop me and they claiming that they know me

[Chorus]
And they going on and on, asking favors
Damn, now my time's stolen
I wanna help, swear I got the best intentions
But right now, I need a moment
I need a minute to myself (I need that minute, minute)
I need a minute to myself (Get up, get up off me)

[Bridge]
I just need a minute, I just need like 60 seconds
I just need a minute, I just need like 60 seconds
I just need a minute, I just need like 60 seconds
I just need a minute, I just need like 60 seconds

[Chorus]
I need a minute to myself (I need that minute, minute)
I need a minute to myself (Get up, get up off me)
I need a minute to myself (I need that minute, minute)
I need a minute to myself (Get up, get up off me)
