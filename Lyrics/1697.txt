LOST YOU Lyrics[Verse 1]
Didn't know that love could change ya
Then I woke up to a stranger
After all this time, I thought that I knew
You and I was no debating
Now it's up for conversation
Tell me, was it all a lie? I'm confused, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am, right back with you
[Chorus]
Although I lost you
I, I'll always want you
'Cause you take me high (High)
See, I'll always want you
But I know I've lost you

[Post-Chorus]
Say it, right (Right)
(Oh-ooh-ah)

[Verse 2]
I won't hold the past against you
When you hold me, I forget to
I can never draw the line with you, no
Wish I knew what you were thinking
But that probably wouldn't change shit
So deep and I'm still falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am, right back with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Although I lost you
I, I'll always want you (I'll always want you)
'Cause you take me high (High)
See, I'll always want you
But I know I've lost you

[Outro]
La-da (Yeah), da-da, da
Oh-oh, oh
Doo-doo-doo-doo, ah, doo-doo, ah-ah3Embed
