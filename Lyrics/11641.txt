Daft Pretty Boys Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's a sunrise dressed like dusk
Going out, she's getting into something
He's a moth drawn to a flame
He's going in, he's going all or nothing
They look so pretty from afar

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the gates of heaven are open now
And my one true love has just waltzed right out, yeah
There's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind
[Instrumental Chorus]
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
There's a dangerous kind of cool about you
But she didn't, no, she didn't know nothin'
Now she swims right past his eyes
Where she didn't, no, she didn't find nothin'
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You look so pretty from afar

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the gates of heaven are open now
And my one true love has just waltzed right out, yeah
There's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind

[Chorus]
Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
All the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
Got no time to waste on another pretty face, whoa-oh-oh
Got no time to waste on another pretty face

[Bridge]
There's one thing about me that you should know
That I can't help from speaking my mind
I don't like you
You look so pretty from afar
I despise you
Why you so fucking perfect on the outside?
She's a sunrise dressed like dusk
Going out, she's getting into something
He's going all or nothing
I'm saying
You might also like[Chorus]
Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
All the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
Got no time to waste on another pretty face
Girl, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
All the time in the world for chasing pretty girls
Yeah, you waste your time on daft pretty boys
Got no time to waste on another pretty face, whoa-oh-oh
Got no time to waste on another pretty face, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Got no time to waste on another pretty face, ooh6Embed
