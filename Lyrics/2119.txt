Girls Like Girls Lyrics[Intro]
(Boys)
(Boys)
Boys, (Boys)
(Boys)

[Verse 1]
Stealing kisses from your missus
Does it make you freak out?
Got you fussing, got you worried
Scared to let your guard down
Boys, boys
Tell the neighbors I'm not sorry if I'm breaking walls down
Building your girl's second story, ripping all your floors out
[Chorus]
Saw your face, heard your name, gotta get with you
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new
Isn't this why we came? Gotta get with you
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new

[Verse 2]
Always gonna steal your thunder
Watch me like a dark cloud
On the move collecting numbers
I'ma take your girl out
We will be everything that we'd ever need
Don't tell me, tell me what I feel
I'm real and I don't feel like boys
I'm real and I don't feel like boys

[Chorus]
Saw your face, heard your name, gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Isn't this why we came? Gotta get with you
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new

[Bridge]
I've been crossing all the lines, all the lines
Kissed your girl back made you cry, boys
You might also like[Chorus]
Saw your face, heard your name, gotta get with you
Girls like girls, like boys do, nothing new
Isn't this why we came? Tell me if you feel it too!
Tell me, girls like girls like boys do, nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do, nothing new58Embed
