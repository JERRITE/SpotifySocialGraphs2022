My Dying Spirit Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm barely on my feet, mama
Barely holding on by a thread
Every night I lose a different friend
Thought I had it how I wanted
Far away as I could ever dream
I don't think California's my speed

[Pre-Chorus]
All on my own
All I know
[Chorus]
If I'm high like those other guys you've kissed
Maybe I'll find you in my bed again
But I'm all alone, living on the edge
I'm right at the limit
Will I ever heal my dying spirit

[Verse 2]
I'm hanging on needless hunger
Keeps the tears out the devil's eyes
I don't eat because he tells me that it's fine
Barely even standing now
Goddamn I need another round
I can hear my name out in the crowd, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If I'm high like those other guys you've kissed
Maybe I'll find you in my bed again
But I'm all alone, living on the edge
I'm right at the limit
Will I ever heal my dying spirit

[Bridge]
If I was a hotel lobby, you'd be mighty fucking sorry to be staying at this piece of shit right off highway 9
I'm on the floor of my kitchen on a vaporizing mission
Find a little calm
Please ease my mind
I'm so sorry Alexa, I won't make her graduation
But tell Sloaney girl she's the apple of my eye
Tell her, take your time
Take your time
Take your
Take your
Take your time
I get high
You might also like[Outro]
Yeah, oh baby, yeah
Every night I'm hanging on by a thread
Yeah, oh baby, yeah
I'll never heal it, my dying spirit1Embed
