Leave A Little Love Lyrics[Chorus]
Before you go and leave my life
Find paradise in someone else's eyes
Just one thing you'll promise me
I'm begging please, please, please
Just leave a little love for me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Yeah, leave a little love for me
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Just leave a little love for me
(Oh yеah, oh yeah)
Yeah, leavе a little love for me
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
[Chorus]
Before you go and leave my life
Find paradise in someone else's eyes
Just one thing you'll promise me
I'm begging please, please, please
Just leave a little love for me

[Verse]
When I'm drowning in the midnight
I'm trying to mend my broken heart
I could tell you what it feels like
I'm trying to shoot straight in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
One step closer
Standing on the edge, I'm looking over
Here's to my regrets, it's time for closure
But I can't seem to close the door
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Before you go and leave my life
Find paradise in someone else's eyes
Just one thing you'll promise me
I'm begging please, please, please
Just leave a little love for me

[Chorus]
Before you go and leave my life
Find paradise in someone else's eyes
Just one thing you'll promise me
I'm begging please, please, please
Just leave a little love for me

[Bridge]
Yeah, leave a little love for me
Oh, no
