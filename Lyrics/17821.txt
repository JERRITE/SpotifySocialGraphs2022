Don’t Start, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
You can leave that intro, we 'bout to–, aw, man
We got JBans in the stu' (You better get in tune, like)
Kha wit' me (Hold on, oh, what?), Lover got the .30 (Baow)
Plus see-through, with the laser (What?)
Word to my mother, he just, aw, man

[Verse 1]
I'm really EBK
JJ, he wit' me and you know he droppin' rakes
You move hot, you get shot today
In the hood movin' tact', broke boy, you know how I play
Where you at, you could die today
If you not in my circle then you know you outta place
Got some shooters that's outta state
I done told y'all already that I ain't gon' hesitate
Like, call Choppa U-Haul 'cause that nigga movin'
Hop out the V, I just might lose it
I got some shooters that's feenin' to boom 'em
These niggas must, think it's really just music
Like, don't ask if I'm Choo or am I Woo
Nigga, I'm Structure, don't try to confuse it
He owe me bread, his ass on a pool stick
And I just might disrespect him
With a TD, I'm Victor, a Chevy, I'm Odell Beckham
We cause terror like 9/11
Call up the cuz and you know he finna wet 'em
I got shooters that's down to stretch 'em
Niggas jack beef, but you know I never met 'em
Bando can't wait to catch 'em
I been trappin' and juggin' since I was the age of seven
I got a stick and move
Got a bad lil' bitch who'll line you up for some shoes
She want Chanels from me
How you gon' move like you tough and then tell on me?
And my shooters give Hell for me
But if I do the hit, they gotta have bail for me
We spot 'em, my niggas spinnin' with so many options
I swear it's two or three different knockings
Bitches be fuckin' off Henny and vodka
Like, look, I love when they kick us like we playin' soccer
I used to unload and reload the choppa
I do a drill bumpin' Biggie - Who Shot Ya?
My plug got shells that's bigger than lobsters
Can't fuck with niggas who move like a copper
Like, I don't get that
You got shot in yo ass and then made a diss track
Pick up a gun and go get back
He tried to flex, bullet rip through his six-pack
We put that boy in a shit bag
Like, niggas know I don't cap
I made it cool to jack what I jack
I'm EBK, niggas know all the facts
You respect me, I respect you
So I fuck with my Woos who really could rap
Don't ask about Pop, don't ask about Ciggy
I'm chasin' guap and I'm gettin' plenty
Shots to your chest is like we drinkin' Henny
If she wanna fuck then I tell her to jank me
(Shots to your chest is like we drinkin' Henny
If she wanna fuck then I tell her to jank me, like)
[Chorus]
I told 'em, "Don't start with me"
But these niggas done started some shit
I keep a Glock with a stick
He make a move and his apple get split
Like, like, slide
Hop in the V, let's go for a ride
Like, pride
Don't lose your life tryna trip over pride

[Verse 2]
She wanna drive
Ain't tryna get naked, pull that to the side
We gotta vibe
But I'm movin' cautious 'cause bitches the line
JJ gon' hop out and blast 'em
We makin' movies, call up PG
Then get rid of all when we flash 'em
I got some shooters that's really elite
They up in the jet in the Ashton
I need the backend
She want a Mackage
I'm in the hood and I'm still movin' tactic
If I can't back it I'll shoot through the jacket
They do not know me so they think I'm cappin'
Subs on the book but it ain't no reactions
Call up, Kha Structure, you know he gon' whack 'em, like
You might also like[Chorus]
I told 'em, "Don't start with me"
But these niggas done started some shit
I keep a Glock with a stick
He make a move and his apple get split
Like, like, slide
Hop in the V, let's go for a ride
Like, pride
Don't lose your life tryna trip over pride, like

[Outro]
Don't ask if I'm, don't ask if I'm, what?
Don't ask if I'm, what?
Nigga, I'm shootin', I'm tryna come through
