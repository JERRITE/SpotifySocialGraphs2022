(Let somebody, let somebody go)

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars cause this I know
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez, Both]
All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now, without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Chris Martin, Chris Martin]
Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go (Body go)
Oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh
(Let somebody, let somebody go)

[Bridge: Chris Martin, with Selena Gomez]
Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know
Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know
So when you love somebody
When you love somebody

Then it hurts like so
To let somebody go
It hurts like so
To let somebody go

[Outro: Chris Martin]

But you're still with me now, I know12Embed
