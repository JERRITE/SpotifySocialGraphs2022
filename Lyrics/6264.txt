All These Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've been going like a hurricane
Who's gonna be the one to break the silence
Are you driving in another lane?
'Cause I've been waking to the sound of sirens

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking lately
Thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking lately
You're somebody I don't wanna lose
[Chorus]
All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Have all of these nights been leading to something?
'Cause all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Say, say you wanna stay
All of thesе nights we've been talking and touching
And  all I wanna hear is you to say you lovе me

[Verse 2]
Levitating, got me off the ground
Out of control and I can't stop climbing
Look what you do to me, look what you do to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking lately
Thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking lately
You're somebody I don't wanna lose

[Chorus]
All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Have all of these nights been leading to something?
'Cause all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Say, say you wanna stay (Oh, oh)
All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me (Oh, oh)
I've been thinking
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me

All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Have all of these nights been leading to something?
'Cause all I wanna hear is you to say you love me

[Chorus]
All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Have all of these nights been leading to something?
'Cause all I wanna hear is you to say you love me
Say, (Say) say you wanna stay (Stay, oh, oh)
All of these nights we've been talking and touching
And all I wanna hear is you to say you love me1Embed
