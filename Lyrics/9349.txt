Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) [Bryce Miller/Alloy Tracks Remix] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you

[Interlude]
No!
No!

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Someday, love will find you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Outro]
No!
No!You might also like1Embed
