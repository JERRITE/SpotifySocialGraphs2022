Time Stands Lyrics[Verse 1]
For a moment, I could wait to see it fall apart
Every empty bed in every city I've been
I sit and contemplate all the moments you said
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

[Verse 2]
What's that you used to say? Find a love that you can wait for
Or do you feast upon the weak and weary of heart?
I can take the pain, but I can't take all the hatred
Laziness of mind and simplest of thoughts
[Chorus]
Are you just too old, or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

[Verse 3]
Now you're pouring out your hate at every difference you found
You won't even listen to reason at all
Not questioning your faith, far be it from me
But you would speak of love while tying one's hands

[Chorus]
Are you just too old, or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old, or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

[Verse 4]
Now lean and use your weight, that's what a shoulder's made for
Carry all the dead and children from here
Curses on the men and the greed that seems to plague them
I can't raise my hand, so I'm raising my voice

[Chorus]
Are you just too old, or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old, or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
You might also like[Outro]
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Time stands in a duel and I stand for youEmbed
