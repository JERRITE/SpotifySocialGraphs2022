Scarred For Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've done, everything we've talked about
I tried, they don't wanna give it up (give it up)
I thought, you really got it right this time
So wrong, they don't wanna give it up (give it up)
It almost felt alive again, now this struggle long and vain
Made up, made up
You made it up
I believed in every lie 'bout a love that never dies
Made up, made up
You made it up
[Chorus]
Cuts are getting deeper
You really fucked me up this time
I just can't stop bleeding
Baby I am scarred for life

[Verse 2]
Was it worth it, did it do you any good
Was she worth it, did she do you good
Every night I had to wait, telling me you're working late
Made up, made up
You made it up
I remember what you said and it echoes in my head
Made up, made up
You made it up

[Chorus]
Cuts are getting deeper
You really fucked me up this time
I just can't stop bleeding
Baby I am scarred for life

[Bridge]
I will never try again can't survive another end
Give up, give up
I give it up
We'll build us up a hundred times
You really told me down tonight
(Break up, break up)
I'm breaking up
You might also like[Chorus]
Cuts are getting deeper
You really fucked me up this time
I just can't stop bleeding
Baby I am scarred for life
Cuts are getting deeper
You really fucked me up this time
I just can't stop bleeding
Baby I am scarred for life
Baby I am scarred for lifeEmbed
