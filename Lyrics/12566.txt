Million Bucks Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some people say there's nothing really real here
They paint it like a sun without a soul
So I thought I could love nothing but the breeze here
But I fell hard for what just blew in off the coast

[Pre-Chorus]
State I'm in right now
Salt drips from her brow
No more days without
Makes me feel so right
I can do no wrong
We'll keep going strong
[Chorus]
I've got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
Got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks

[Verse 2]
I used to be a skeptic non-believer
But now it's changed, you're worth your weight in gold
The richest love ain't growing on the trees out here
But confidently, I can say I'm sold

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay all-in right now
Salt drips from her brow
No more days without
Makes me feel so right
I can do no wrong
We'll keep going strong

[Chorus]
I've got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
Got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you

[Bridge]
The ceiling's just the start
Reaching for a star
A bullseye from a dart
The ceiling's just the start

[Chorus]
I've got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
Got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
I've got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
Got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks
[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks6Embed
