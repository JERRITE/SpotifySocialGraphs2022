Play Pretend Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout someone special
She's kinda perfect and I wish she knew
Told me that she thinks she has to settle
But I know that ain't true
She used to laugh at all the trouble we got in
Always finding ways to break the rules
Lately, I don't see her smile as often
I think you know it’s you

[Chorus]
Don't take this the wrong way
I want you to be happy
But it's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
Spending all of my time
Dancing on this fine line
It's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
[Post-Chorus]
I know you likе the back of my hand
I want you more evеry day, and
It's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend

[Verse 2]
We can talk until three in the morning
The sun will rise, I never want it to
Feelings for you came without warning
Ever since we met it's only you

[Chorus]
Don't take this the wrong way
I want you to be happy
But it's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
Spending all of my time, dancing on this fine line
It's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend

[Bridge]
I know you like the back of my hand
I want you more every day, and
It's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
All you gotta do is let me be your man
Got a hold on me, like quicksand
It's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh
You might also like[Outro]
Don't take this the wrong way
I want you to be happy
But it's hard to watch you fall again
'Cause now I gotta play pretendEmbed
