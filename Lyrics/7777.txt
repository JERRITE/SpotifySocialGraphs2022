I Am Always Going to Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I felt it from the moment
That you stepped into the light
There was absolutely nothing I could do
I'd be blessed or I'd be cursed
For the rest of my life
'Cause I knew that I was always gonna love you

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna love you til' my dying day
I'll be beside you when you're old and grey
Just like the feelings that I feel right now
I'm never gonna go away
[Verse 2]
If you ever hit your head and
You lost your memory
So that every morning started life anew
Well with every passing day
I'd invent another way to show that
I am always going to love you

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you til' my dying day
I'll be beside you when you're old and grey
And just like the feelings that I feel right now
I'm never gonna go away

[Outro]
From the picture perfect moments
That I never want to end
To the couch and TV kind of afternoons
You're a light that's always shining
There's a million reasons why
I know that I am always gonna love youYou might also likeEmbed
