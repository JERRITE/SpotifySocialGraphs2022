LOT OF ME Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything still cool (Ayy), being me, I can't lose (Ayy)
I know you getting confused
They like, "How you do it so smooth?" (Ayy)
Gotta stay in tune (Ayy), with your love, I can't lose
Say nine, say ten, make sure you gon' lose, yeah (We love you, Tecca)

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Yeah, mixing different shades up, ballin' like the fall (Ayy)
Trap money, real money, yeah, I want it all
I just take my best feelings, put it in a song (Ayy)
I know I was right (Ayy), I know you was wrong (Ayy)
Yeah, I got a vision (Baow), let it capture in 4K (Baow-baow-baow)
We forever young, you won't see me in old age (Ayy)
I'ma do what I want right now, I can't wait 'til it's too late (Ayy)
Everywhere up in the world right now, ten bands in the suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything still cool (Ayy), being me, I can't lose (Ayy)
