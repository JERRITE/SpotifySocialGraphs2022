Ain’t No Half Steppin’ LyricsI've got my eyes on you (no half steppin')
Watching  what you do (no half steppin')
Don't  think that you can't jive (no half steppin')
'Cause I'll be checking all the time (no half steppin')

Ain't no half steppin'
You  gotta do it good
Ain't  no half steppin'
Like you know you should
Ain't  no half steppin'
Stop and smell the smoke
Ain't no half steppin'
'Cause we're the funky folk
No  half steppin'
Are you good enough to show?
Do you think you got the soul?
Are you sharp enough to shine?
Can you party all the time?

Don't let your motors run (no half steppin')
Keep on keeping on (no half steppin')
I said don't let me see you slide (no half steppin')
'Cause party people keep it tight (no half steppin')

Ain't no half steppin'
You gotta do it good
Ain't no half steppin'
Like you know you should
Ain't no half steppin'
Stop and smell the smoke
Ain't no half steppin'
'Cause we're the funky folk

No half steppin'
Are you good enough to show?
Do you think you got the soul?
Are you sharp enough to shine?
Can you party all the time?
