Lovinâ€™ Woman LyricsI'm kinda sick, mama, kinda down
Truckload of trouble, Lord, be what I found
And as I turn Mama, get away
Another spoken problem done got somethin' to say, yeah

Lord, I gotta find my home
Oh yeah, I need a lovin' woman I can call my own
Yeah you see, I'm just tired, mama, oh tired of runnin' alone
I need a, I need a lovin' woman
Oh I can call my own
Ain't got no time Ma', no time to think
Search me some gold child, grab me a drink
Got's me a frown, baby, need to find a smile
Whether your grass is green or blue, child, I'll walk the mile, yeah

Lord, I gotta find my home
I need a lovin' woman I can call my own
Lord, oh I'm just tired
Oh Lord I'm tired of runnin' alone, oh yeah
