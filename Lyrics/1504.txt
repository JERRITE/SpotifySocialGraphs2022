Middle of the Night Lyrics[Verse 1: Brad]
I keep coming back to that moment
Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
'Til I can't feel my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Brad]
And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I do all I can
To get you out of my head
[Chorus: Brad]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

[Post-Chorus: Brad & Martin Jensen]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

[Verse 2: Brad]
I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

[Pre-Chorus: Brad]
Yeah, and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
To forget you again

[Chorus: Brad]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you

[Chorus: Brad]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

[Post-Chorus: Brad & Martin Jensen]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you11Embed
