Break Shit Lyrics[Chorus]
Ayy, fuck you (Bitch) and the clique that you came with
I ain't for the bullshit, I just need my payment
Fuck you (Bitch), leave yo' ass on the pavement (Brr, brr)
It's the type of night, me and my niggas tryna break shit (Brr, hey, hey)
Fuck you (Bitch) and the clique that you came with
I ain't for the bullshit, I just need my payment
Fuck you (Bitch), leave yo' ass on the pavement
It's the type of night, me and my niggas tryna break shit (Brr, brr, brr, hey, hey)

[Verse]
Cruising down the street with my niggas, we gorillas (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I don't give a fuck where I am, I'll fuck ya' 'ville up ('Ville up)
No, you can't hang, boy, you plain, you vanilla (You vanilla)
Fuck the one percent of crackers mad 'cause I'm a nigga (Ayy)
I kill 'em, don't need no hitters (No hitters)
My niggas rich, makin' high-percentage (High-percentage)
You can't reject me, I'm no rookie or beginner
Talkin' to me crazy, you gon' make me turn to villain
[Chorus]
Ayy, fuck you (Bitch) and the clique that you came with (Fuck it up)
I ain't for the bullshit, I just need my payment
Fuck you (Bitch), leave yo' ass on the pavement
It's the type of night, me and my niggas tryna break shit
Ayy, fuck you (Bitch) and the clique that you came with
I ain't for the bullshit, I just need my payment
Fuck you (Bitch), leave yo' ass on the pavement
It's the type of night, me and my niggas tryna break shit

[Bridge]
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it up
I ain't for the bullshit, I just need my payment
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it up
It's the type of night, me and my niggas tryna break shit

[Chorus]
Ayy, fuck you (Bitch) and the clique that you came with
