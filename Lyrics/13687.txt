That Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
That I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
[Drop]
That, that, that way, that, that way, want it right now
That, that, that way, that, that way (Tell me why)
That, that, that way, that, that way, want it right now
I want it that way

[Verse 2]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Drop]
That, that, that way, that, that way, want it right now
That, that, that way, that, that way (Tеll me why)
That, that, that way, that, that way, want it right now
I want it that way

I want it that way
Just want it that way
I want it that way, eh
I want it that way
Just want it that way
I want it that way

[Chorus]
Tell mе why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why (Yeah)
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that wayEmbed
