Just Get Here Lyrics[Part I]

[Verse 1: Xavier Omär]
She said, "Babe, are you busy?
Do you mind comin' over to visit?
I mean, like, could you be here in a minute?
I'm missin' you more than I usually do"
I said, "On me (Me), I'll be right there prolly right around three (Three)
Where you tryna go? Tell me what you wanna see (See)
Or we can lay up, girl, you know I'm in the league (Woo)
And when I'm with you, I don't ever wanna leave (What's up?)"
[Pre-Chorus: Xavier Omär]
And this ain't the last time I'm back at your door
Good and the bad times, I'm tellin' you now

[Chorus: Xavier Omär]
I got it bad for you, baby, I do
I want you back just as soon as you can
Whether you're near or whether you're far as the stars
Baby, just get here
I got it bad for you, baby, I do
I want you back just as soon as you can
I need you near, I need you moments away
Baby, just get here

[Verse 2: VanJess, Xavier Omär, VanJess & Xavier Omär]
Hearin' the alarm is goin' off
But, honey, this dress still comin' off
We got places to be, love
But I've been waitin' for your touch (Ah)
What you do to me, there is no escape
Too lost in this daze, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, I cannot pretend, I don't want this to end
Said I'm fiendin' for ya and I'm missing ya, baby
I'm creepin', I'm investigatin'
That lovin' you givin' got me goin' crazy
Don't make me wait, you already late
Pick up the pace, on my way just to see your face
I got it bad for you, baby, I do
I got what you're missin', I'm tellin' you now
You might also like[Chorus: Xavier Omär]
I got it bad for you (Yeah), baby, I do (Yeah)
I want you back just as soon as you can (Woo)
Whether you're near or whether you're far as the stars
Baby, just get here (I need you right beside me now, when the rain is falling down)
I got it bad for you (Baby, I do)
I want you back just as soon as you can (Soon as you can)
I need you near (I need you near), I need you moments away (Ooh)
Baby, just get here

[Bridge: Xavier Omär]
Can you make it here?
Oh
Ooh
Make it
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Wale]
You're on my mind, I'm in your heart, I love the vibe
We don't do titles but if we did they'd be unified
Is it love, lust? Uh, we let the mood decide
I maneuver through them thighs, I'm makin' sure you oblige
Like, what's the 411? I am so punch drunk
I am in hot water like good night, Rev Run
Heaven's missin' an angel, 'cause heaven know I seen one
'Fore I check on another I should be checkin' my pulse
Drop top lookin' drop-top gorgeous
Balenciaga mama, you will not pay for it
Flight change, I upgrade ya serious
I get you nice things but don't change for material possessions
I know you love flexin'
I know I love my privacy, we can't meet in the middle
But I can be the remedy 'cause baby, you the illest
I communicate the best 'cause we can't illustrate the feelin', inexplicable
And with that said, the less that's said, the better
Smoke a couple petals and I'll tell you 'bout the pedestal I got you on forever
'Cause I got you on forever
If love is like a concert, lil' mama, this a residency
I ain't gon' let up, I ain't gon' let up
I think so highly of you, buy you infinite stilettos
And intimacy's necessary but she love aggression
So I bring my doll to life, it's more like I'm Geppetto
But better, Folarin
[Bridge: Xavier Omär]
Take your time (With the way you love me, babe)
Not a day goes by (I'm not thinkin' of you, babe)
Oh, you changed my life (You changed everything now)
It's better, it's better when you're here
Here (Woo)

[Outro: Xavier Omär]
Bae, swear I'm on the way
Beside a good man a good woman, I relate, yeah
Bae, swear I'm on the way
Beside a good man a good woman2Embed
