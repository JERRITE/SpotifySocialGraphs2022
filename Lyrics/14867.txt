Anaâ€™s Song (Open Fire) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please die, Ana
For as long as you're here
We're not
You make the sound of laughter
And sharper now seems softer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I need you now, somehow
And I need you now, somehow
[Chorus]
Open fire on the needs designed
On my knees for you
Open fire on my knees desires
What I need from you

[Verse 2]
Imagine pagaent
In my head, the flesh seems thicker
Sandpaper tears corrode the film

[Pre-Chorus]
And I need you now, somehow
And I need you now, somehow

[Chorus]
Open fire on the needs designed
On my knees for you
Open fire on my knees desires
What I need from you

[Bridge]
And you're my obsession
I love you to the bones
And Ana wrecks your life
Like an anorexia life
You might also like[Chorus]
Open fire on the needs designed
On my knees for you

[Chorus]
Open fire on my knees desires
What I need from you
Open fire on the needs designed
Open fire on my needs designed
On my knees for you5Embed
