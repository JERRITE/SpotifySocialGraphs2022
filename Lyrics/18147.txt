​i ain’t rich, girl Lyrics[Chorus]
I ain't rich girl
I ain’t got a nice car
And my credit card bills aren't paid
We can get by, we don't need no money
We can survive on this, oh, sweet loving

[Verse 1]
I know you got no time for me
’Cause you've got your mind on finer things
But that's fine with me
All I got is love and a song to sing
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me be your unexpected taste
Wrapped around like Gucci on your waist
I could be your favourite summer phase
If you could see it through Balenciaga shades

[Chorus]
I ain't rich girl
I ain't got a nice car
And my credit card bills aren't paid
We can get by, we don't need no money
We can survive on this, oh, sweet loving
I ain't rich girl
But I’ve got a big hеart
And that’s all that matters anyway
We can get by, wе don't need no money
We can survive on this, oh, sweet loving

[Verse 2]
You know you look good in your favourite Prada sweater
But you don’t need to wear it in ninety degree weather, yeah
And remember, I can do it better
I know you like your Fiji, but I swear I'll make you

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me be your unexpected taste
Wrapped around like Gucci on your waist
I could be your favourite summer phase
If you could see it through Balenciaga shades
You might also like[Bridge]
I know you think I'm not enough
But we'd have that priceless kind of love
No way you’d say I'm not the one
Not the one

[Chorus]
I ain't rich girl
I ain't got a nice car
And my credit card bills aren't paid
We can get by, we don't need no money
We can survive on this, oh, sweet loving
I ain't rich girl
But I've got a big heart (Yeah)
And that's all that matters anyway
We can get by, we don't need no money
We can survive on this, oh, sweet loving (Oh, sweet loving)

[Outro]
I know you got no time for me
'Cause you've got your mind on finer things
But that's fine with me
All I got is love and a song to singEmbed
