U Wanna Dance? Lyrics[Chorus: Mica Tenenbaum]
Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now
Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now

[Verse 1: Mica Tenenbaum]
It's a fucked up world, are you cool enough to get it?
Fit enough to sweat it? See me driving, gonna rev it
If you want to (Uh)
And you want to (Na, na, na, na)
With an old worldview, so emotional and ready
Tiene' el alma heavy, no te escondas, dime, baby
If you want to (Uh)
And you want to (Na, na, na, na)
[Pre-Chorus: Mica Tenenbaum]
Face yourself, erase yourself for love (For love)
Oh, I know you really want it

[Chorus: Mica Tenenbaum]
Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now
Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now

[Verse 2: Mica Tenenbaum]
It's a fucked up world, but you've got a girl
If you want to
And you want to (Na, na, na, na)
And you're turning blue like you're dying just to get it
You see me in my leather and you're taking off your sweater
'Cause you want to
Yeah, you want to (Na, na, na, na, hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Mica Tenenbaum]
Face yourself, erase yourself for love (For love)
I know you really want it

Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now
Oh, if you wanna dance shimmy on time
Oh, if you wanna dance, see you in line
I'm the girl when you wanna get down
Just a little longer, keep it up now

[Outro: Mica Tenenbaum]
Oh, do you wanna go? Baby, let me know
I'm the girl, take me down, take me down, oh
Oh, do you wanna go? Baby let me know
I'm the girl, take me down, take me down, ohEmbed
