I Fell (Darby Allin AEW Theme) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't sleep ’cause my head's on fire
I hate creeps, and I hate liars
Oh, you want a grave kept secret that I never tell
I'm up in heaven but I came from hell

[Chorus]
I fell
So did you
I fell
I fell
So did you
[Verse 2]
It doesn’t matter what came before
I felt pain and I wanted more
Oh, I'm not settled until I've done it all and right
I split my head open again last night

[Chorus]
I fell
So did you
I fell
I fell
So did you

[Verse 3]
I don't sleep 'cause my head's on fire
I hate creeps, and I hate liars
Oh, you want a grave kept secret that I never tell
I'm up in heaven but I came from hell

[Bridge]
I came from death, I'm dead
And torn up flesh
I painted my face white and then it turned out red
I came from nothing
And nothing is where I return
You lit a match, now watch it burn
You might also like[Chorus]
I fell
So did you
I fell
So did you
I fell
So did you
I fell
I fell
So did you5Embed
