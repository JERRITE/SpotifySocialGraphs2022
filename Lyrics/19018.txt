The Burning of Sodom LyricsOnce, the tale of Sodom brought anguish to the eyes
Of all god-fearing people with eternal afterlives
Sin and lust run rampant now, perversion on the rise
Reliving all the ways of old, Gomorrah realized

Sodom, an unholy place, angels searched for few
Souls who'd yet to fall from grace to save them from the doom
Paradise of pleasures lost herein the future lies
Laughing at the holy cross as death rained from the skies

Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, the sinners pay
Skeptics failed to heed the call of angels sent to tell
Of the impending death to all in a blazing city hell
Consorting with the demon's craft the ways of God repelled
Burning cross, cause to laugh, lot, the one expelled

Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, the sinners pay

[Instrumental Break]

The sufferers' impalement inside the city gates
Worshiping the holy priests, the masters of all hate
The flag of the inverted cross, menacing, held high
Laughing at the holy cross, at twelve, the virgin dies

Our righteous family did escape the family-father lot
Sinful daughters succumbed to rape, not as holy as thought
Mankind throughout eternity built on evils' designs
The resilience of iniquity lives on in Christian minds

Falling from the heavens
Angels lie decayed
Burning, city of Sodom
One by one, the sinners payYou might also likeEmbed
