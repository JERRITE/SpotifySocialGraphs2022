​i wish the world ended in 2012 Lyrics[Intro]
POSHBOY!
They don't love you (No, they don't really love you)
They just love what you can do for them (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I ain't never ask for nothing but respect
It's my season
Watch your mouth
I'm coming for your neck
Every time I shoot baby it's
WET [x4]
Read a lick better than I read a book
Never stole shit baby, I took what I took
I tried to tell em, but I think that they misunderstood
I did everything, and you only did what you could
[Chorus]
I could take his shit
Only need one look
I could take his bitch
Only need one look
I could take his shit
Only need one look
I could take his bitch
Only need one look
I could take his shit
Only need one look

[Verse 2]
They don't love you
They just love what you can do for em
Cut em off
That's the best thing you could do for em
I'm not hating
I'm still undercover rooting for em
I'm just sick and tired of turning all they juice on
WET [x4]
Only need one look [x4]

[Outro]
I could take his bitch
I could take his shit
I could take his bitch
I could take his shitYou might also like2Embed
