The Original LyricsEverybody's gonna lose their minds
When they see what you're gonna do
Play it back like a million times
Because they know that you're the absolute

The original, moon walker, heart stopper
The original, black leather, forever
The original

Everybody's gonna stand in line
They wanna touch a little Solid Gold
When you're classic when you start it all
You ain't never ever getting old
No one else is even coming close
They're all just reaching for a piece of youYou might also likeEmbed
