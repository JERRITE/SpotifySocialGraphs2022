Rap Shit Easy Breh Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lay that murder game
Enhale that Mary Jane with my eyes closed and a busy brain
I feel like Bizzy Bone, I'm always busy now
I barely call my moms, I'm going Hollywood
It doesn't shade my love I'm just misunderstood
That's why my foreign chicks don't really think I care about them
Because I text them twice a month on some random shit
Ain't got time to talk I'm turning to a man
Life been interesting since I flew away from Baltimore
Finally on my own, doing drugs more learning from the trips
The different naked chicks I connected with
Found me some hippie'd out black girls on scholarships
Learned a lot of life that Chicago winter
Drugs, girls, and Harold's Chicken for my dinner
Gahtdamn I swear that shit was all a dream
Dropped out of college after Thanksgiving, I wasn't having with it
I gave that shit a shot, I'd rather shoot at rappers
I rather give them comp, I'd rather set examples
College too expensive, I got a drug addiction
I swear I lose weight when I write raps
Trying to live to see my dream stay awake in my naps
Nappy headed nigga syndrome
I was raised by pimps, I'm the heir to bitches
[Verse 2]
I know every word in "Paid In Full"
Hash in the blunt niggas about to skip school
Young nigga making moves back in the day getting views on Youtube off raps it took me 10 minutes to write
I been kicking rhymes since they aired Nick & Nite nigga
(What you know about the Cosby Show?)
Leftover keys from the Bellagio in my wallet
Kicking knowledge in the studio
Knowledge is the key to life, watch me twist the knob
I'm not the type of nigga to get a hand job
I look like Ray Charles Barkley
Dunking on rappers hella easy with my eyes closes looking Godly, looking gnarly nigga
Tell that bitch to wine me down
Tommy Hilfiger Road, I live in Nike Town
I run in the same circles as Rich His
I chills with girls that pop pills forreals
I got deals on acid and Molly pills
I'm the Mushroom Master turned rapper
Rap game Len Bias nigga we drugged out
Nigga we thugged out, we took the Tupac route
Just to see how it turn out, got a fortune on my mind
Awe fuck I fucked up that last line
And it still rhymed

[Verse 3]
Refined in line with Einstein
Sipping Chandon out a Slurpee cup you dumb fuck
I'm addicted to phat butts, blunts, and junk food
Need a hoe that can run, jump, suck, and handle drugs
Sorry my love all I'm seeing through these eyes
Is fingers passing blunts like Brazilian Thighs, with mushroom eyes
I can make some money off of one of these thoughts
Living for the dream the King fought for
I'm a young king live from the underground
Trying to get my head big enough so I can wear the crown
But I'm n to a cocky nigga keep it strictly undergroundYou might also likeEmbed
