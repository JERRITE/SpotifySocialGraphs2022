Cocktail Lyrics[Intro: Young Adz]
Ouch
I done seen a whole lot of women, but I've never seen this woman 'round town
Feelin' like I wanna pull up, pull down, spit game, exchange, I'm out
I might pull up, [?]
I might pull up, [?]
You see who's real
You see who's real

[Chorus: Young Adz]
Ouch, yeah
I done seen a whole lot of women but I never seen this woman 'round town
Feelin' like I wanna pull up, pull down, spit game, exchange, I'm out, yeah
I got lean by the litre and we be buying flavours by the ounce, yeah
If you hold this hammer one more night, darling, I might take you shopping up town
[Verse 1: Dirtbike LB]
She got me up in Harrods for some female shoes
Man, I need more jewels
Girl, I said "Drop out those niggas, you don't need those fools"
They ain't winners, they lose
Half a brick of snow on my Roley
Fuck them niggas, they owe me
I only let her drink my lean 'cause she cute
I had to spoil her with Loubs
She know I'm the man
Spent 100 bands but I don't pay tax
This Henny that I pour, it make me talk more, I'm rich off the trap
All these bitches on tour, you know I'm with Bane, I don't need my wap
But we come from pain, we come from estates, I say more life to that

[Chorus: Young Adz]
Ouch, yeah
I done seen a whole lot of women but I never seen this woman 'round town
Feelin' like I wanna pull up, pull down, spit game, exchange, I'm out, yeah
I got lean by the litre and we be buying flavours by the ounce, yeah
If you hold this hammer one more night, darling, I might take you shopping up town

[Verse 2: Yxng Bane]
Yeah, shoes
Tell me want you want, watch me get it times two
Came for the belly like a crop top too
But she tell me that she love me if she gets new shoes
Yeah, who knew?
Now I'm doing shows, she don't act brand new
Now I'm doing shows, she acts like we knew
Each other way back so she pour falls through
I'm in your hood without a top
Dan came a long way from robbing plants
I know she say that she my main, but she ain't the one
I bought some jewels, my nigga [?] and I bought him grub
But then I got bit by a snake, a venom one
But Diadora sign a check, a wetty one
I made my nigga hold a huh, from a rack song
We ballin' out on you boys, COMME des GARÃ‡ONS, in fashion
You might also like[Chorus: Young Adz]
Ouch, yeah
I done seen a whole lot of women but I never seen this woman 'round town
Feelin' like I wanna pull up, pull down, spit game, exchange, I'm out, yeah
I got lean by the litre and we be buying flavours by the ounce, yeah
If you hold this hammer one more night, darling, I might take you shopping up town

[Outro: Young Adz]
I done seen a whole lot of women but I never seen this woman 'round town
Feelin' like I wanna pull up, pull down, spit game, exchange, I'm out, yeah
I got lean by the litre and we be buying flavours by the ounce, yeah
If you hold this hammer one more night, darling, I might take you shopping up town2Embed
