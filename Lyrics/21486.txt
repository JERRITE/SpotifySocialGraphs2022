Where the Dark Things Are LyricsAltars to ashes
Burn down my churches
And give up what's holy
To live off your mercy

Joining the forces
Summon the powers
Rip me to pieces

Cause you know I would die if I won't live
Push me down to my knees
And take me where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are

Black is the magic
White is the night sky
Please make me have it
I'll worship you all night

Ruin and ravage
Make me your priestess
Rip me to pieces

Cause you know I would die if I won't live
Push me down to my knees
And take me where the dark things are

Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
Where the dark things are
