Back Seat Driver (Spirit Guide) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Aw baby, switched at birth
The money ring around
So let's run away
Never to be found
A couple overdosin'
A case of Rolling Rock
Just got personal
Don't call the cops

[Chorus]
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
Colliding, collapse, the crash that kills
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
'Bout time that you took the wheel
Backseat driver
'Bout time that you took the wheel
[Verse 2]
I wanna fly straight
Into your blind spot
No more time to waste
It's gettin' too hot

[Chorus]
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
Colliding, collapse, the crash that kills
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
'Bout time that you took the wheel

[Bridge]
Spirit guide
A backseat driver
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
Back again

[Chorus]
Spirit guide
Backseat driver
'Bout time that you took the wheel
Spirit guide
Backseat driver

It's a long ride, from long lengths
Don't cry 'bout what you cannot change
Don't worry baby, I'll keep you safe
Don't cry 'bout what you cannot change
Don't worry baby, I'll keep you safe1Embed
