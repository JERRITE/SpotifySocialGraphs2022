The Rock Who Found A Rollinâ€™ Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are my rock who found a rolling stone
Yeah you picked me and you took me home
You smoothed out the edges and you made me shine
Saving me from myself baby right on time

[Chorus]
You are my heart
You are my soul
You give these arms something to hold
And without you, well I'd be a mess
Still tumbling down a mountain heading for the edge
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm strong, sometimes I'm weak
But you always seem to see the best in me
Yeah the love you give could make me lose control
Go on, lift your gate baby, let me pay the toll

[Chorus]
You are my heart
You are my soul
You give these arms something to hold
And without you, well I'd be a mess
Still tumbling down a mountain heading for the edge

[Bridge]
Baby lay with me tonight
Lay with me tonight

[Chorus]
You are my heart
You are my soul
You give these arms something to hold
And without you, well I'd be a mess
Still tumbling down a mountain heading for the edge
Straight down a mountain heading for the edge

[Outro]
You are my rock who found a rolling stone
You picked me up and you took me homeYou might also likeEmbed
