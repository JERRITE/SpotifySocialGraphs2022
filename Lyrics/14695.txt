Big Banana Lyrics[Intro: Prophet]
DJ Havana Brown, you crazy?
Havana, I heard you got a question, though?
Talk to 'em
Let’s go

[Verse 1: Prophet]
Thicker than a Magnum, ace of spades
Strobe light, we can play charades
My pants, keepin’ ace
Bananas, clips, shoot for days
[Bridge: Prophet & (Havana Brown)]
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
What?
(That big fat...)

[Verse 1: Havana brown]
I’m goin' out tonight
Got a locked gun, I don't wanna fight
I’m a hot girl, I have a right
Have a right, have a right
Kill a guy hard, I'ma call you Bruce
Be a Top Gunner, I'ma call you Cruise
Beat it up, up, up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

[Chorus: Havana Brown & (Prophet)]
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
(If you want that, baby, I got it)
Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
That big fat...

If your shit don't, matter black or white
Let me shake the, uh, don't cut the light
Let 'em all bark, I love to bite
Love to bite, love to bite
Gettin' tipsy, ain't getting loose
I got the vodka, they got the juice
Beat it up, up, up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

[Chorus: Havana Brown]
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
That big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana, ooh-na-na-nana

[Bridge: Havana Brown & (Prophet)]
Do you have a big banana?
(If you want that, baby, I got it)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
That big fat... (Let's go)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
Gi-gi-gi-give me (Let's go)
That big fat...
[Outro: Prophet]
Let's go, go, she don't know (Yeah)
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
Automat black with the Rolls go
Let's go go, she don't know
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
Automat black with the Rolls goEmbed
