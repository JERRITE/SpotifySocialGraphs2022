TranslationsEspañolРусскийDanny Phantom Lyrics[Intro: Nicole Zymek & Trippie Redd]
Yeah, first I wanna show you some of this damage, it's pretty hard to miss considering it's front and center on this red Ferrari
You can see the 14 very clearly on the front hood
That suspect also put in 1400 on the side door
Before going on to the BMW over there
He also wrote 1400 on the other side of this orange Aston Martin (Outtatown, but we never outta money)
Before going on to a second Ferrari at the back there (Star Boy, you're my hero, huh)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Pull up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (Yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (Ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (Ghost)
Pulled up in a Ghost, big body Ghost (Yeah, yeah)
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (Ha, ghost)
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost (Ghost)
[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Bitch, I'm going ghost, huh
Let a pussy nigga try me like I'm DeJ Loaf, huh (Ayy)
Suck my dick, yeah, my body (Yeah) so insane, I know, uh (Ayy-ayy, ayy)
Bring that back, I'ma swing, let a nigga know, huh (Ayy)
Just like the Knicks, play with my balls
Play with my dick, wear out your walls
Just like a gnome, I'm at your home
Right on your yard, pulling your card
My bitch big body, moves like the president
You cannot rap, you are irrelevant
I'm just beginning just like I'm Genesis
She wanna fuck 'cause I got melanin, ayy
