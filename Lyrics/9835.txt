Take My Time Lyrics[Intro]
Tha Biz, Tha Bizness

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time
Oh, oh, just do me
Do you right
[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, when you step all wet from out the shower, baby
I want you to lay down, just stay naked
Now I'm staring for an hour, babe, oh
I got your back up against the wall
I got strength, won't let you fall
When I make you bloom like a flower, babe, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna take my time
As stingy as you are, think you're ready?
Girl, I wanna do you right
I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time
Oh, oh, just do me
Do you right

[Verse 2: Tank, Chris Brown]
It ain't your fault you ran out of power, babe
'Cause I've been kissing and licking on you everywhere (You wanna, babe)
Oh, I wanna hear you scream my name and, girl, you know the way
Baby, it's cool I'll wait, for you, baby, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tank]
I just wanna take my time

As stingy as you are, think you're ready?

I just wanna give you what you need
Baby girl, take my time
Oh, oh (Oh, oh), just do me (Ooh)
Do you right
(Do you, do you right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
