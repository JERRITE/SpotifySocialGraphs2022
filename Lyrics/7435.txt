Finally (Cannot Hide It) Lyrics[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Finally, it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

[Verse: Kelly Rowland]
Waited for this moment
It's so golden
You can see it in the way we shine
Oh yes, I do believe we're chosen
Yes I know it, ah
So I ain't gon' let you change my mind
Oh no
[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland & CeCe Peniston]
Finally
The words you used to try to hurt me
Don't mean a thing anymore
Finally
There ain't no stressin', ain't no worries
It's me I'm livin' for

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Finally, it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it (Ah, ah)
Finally, it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it (Finally)
Finally, it has happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me (Finally)
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

[Refrain: Kelly Rowland]

Bitch, I been had the drip like waves (Hey)
Bitch, I done been the bitch, okay?
Not gonna let you bother me
Bitch, I been poppin' shit from day (Hey)
Bitch, I been had the drip like waves (Hey)
Bitch, I done been the bitch, okay?
