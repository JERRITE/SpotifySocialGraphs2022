Locust Laced Lyrics[Verse 1]
A screaming comes a thousand miles
It might be yours, it might be mine
God forgive, but don't forget
Your wicked self is rising
Run, rabbit, run, but you can't escape
The wicked way is here to stay
Run, rabbit, run on broken legs
The wicked day is here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Call up the queen
Give us a taste
[Chorus]
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight

[Verse 2]
Crush my fate, I'm losing breath
Send me an angel of death
God forgive, but don't forget
Send me an angel of dеath
Banshee slams her hand in the door
She won't go outsidе anymore
Banshee slams her hand in the door
She won't go outside anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Call up the queen
Give us a taste

[Chorus]
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight

[Bridge]
Run, rabbit, run, but you can't escape
Run, rabbit, run on broken legs
You might also like[Chorus]
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight
I feel like dynamite, I feel like dying tonight

[Outro]
Just give me a taste
Let it be locust-laced
Just give me a taste
Let it be locust-laced1Embed
