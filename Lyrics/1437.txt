FEEL SOMETHING DIFFERENT Lyrics[Intro: Bea Miller]
I have so many feelings
I can feel something wrong with me
I have so many feelings
But I can feel you and you on the way
So many feelings
I can tell what you want with me
I got so many feelings
But I can feel you and you on the way

[Verse 1: Bea Miller]
If I could choose anything
I would be good in bed one day
I would fall into love and stay
I'd fall into love
[Pre-Chorus: Bea Miller]
And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again (Oh)
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again-gain-gain

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Verse
I just took a pill so that I could really feel (Limbo)
Lights be gettin' blindin' like the diamonds in my grills (I'm shinin')
All my opps know drinks ain't the only thing we gon' spill (Yessir)
Thank God my niggas didn't let me get behind the wheel (Brrt)
Old thing on the phone, lil' zip for the trip and a shot of Patrón (Sheesh)
She want a text back 'cause she miss the cologne (Yee)
Pasqué killed the beat so I had to chamon, look (Yee)
Had to try again like Aaliyah
Drowned in my feelings, but I love to see the ee-yah (True)
This ain't about no signs
Smoke a lil' somethin', eliminate my pride (Bitch)

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Oh, oh, yeah)
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again-gain-gain-gain
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again-gain-gain

[Post-Chorus: Aminé & Bea Miller]
Oh yes (Oh)
Want you, yes (Oh)
Fuck you, yes (Oh)
Yes, yes, yes
Nothin' left (Oh)
Gave you the rest (Oh)
Tried my best (Oh)
Yes, yes, yes, yes

[Bridge: Bea Miller & Aminé]
Can you tell me a secret? (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
I know I should be angry (Say yes, yes, yes, yes)
Can you tell me a secret? (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?  (Yeah)
No
[Chorus: Bea Miller & Aminé, Bea Miller]
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel (Oh, oh, yeah)
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again-gain-gain

[Outro: Aminé & Bea Miller]
Oh, I keep a bad bitch on my mind
Ooh-ooh, oh, mmm, mmm1Embed
