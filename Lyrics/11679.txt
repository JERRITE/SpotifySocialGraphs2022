Daphne Blue Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeffery Jordan]
I don't wanna talk about it
And I think we both know why
I wish it wasn't automatic
The way I want you every time

[Pre-Chorus: Jeffery Jordan]
'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to
Can't think straight since you've been gone
I saw someone out in your go-to outfit
Right when I thought I was on
[Chorus: Spencer Stewart]
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still, you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you

[Verse 2: Jeffery Jordan]
I hesitate to say the ocean
Could hold a candle to your eyes
You shut the door and cut me open
Now I'm wishing I was colorblind

[Pre-Chorus: Jeffery Jordan]
'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to
Right when I thought I was on

[Chorus: Spencer Stewart]
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still, you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you

[Chorus: Spencer Stewart]
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still, you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you3Embed
