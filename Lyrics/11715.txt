​lmho LyricsI’ve been racking my mind
Somebody else is keeping me blind
In the dark, yet again
Can’t keep warm in this time
Playing tricks on my mind
You’re a tough one to find
To find

I can’t see the end
Every time I take a step ahead
I’m as lost as I
Was when I began
What can I say to make anything
Make sense to me anymore?
Play fair with me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?
What can I say to take all the pain
Make it a dream-
Build it right back into me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?

Won’t you let me be free
Trouble can't let its grip go on me
Here i am, stumbling
Sorry if i’ve ‘come a bore
I’ll just even the score
Can’t take me down anymore
Anymore

What can i say to make anything
Make sense to me anymore?
Play fair with me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?
What can i say to take all the pain
Make it a dream-
Build it right back into me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?

Arms ‘round my side
To keep me down
You keep me down
You keep me down
You have your hands all tied in mine
Arms ‘round my side
To keep me down
You keep me down
You keep me down

What can I say?
What can I say?

What can i say to make anything
Make sense to me anymore?
Play fair with me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?
What can i say to take all the pain
Make it a dream-
Build it right back into me
Ain’t it enough that I'm
Laying my heart out?2Embed
