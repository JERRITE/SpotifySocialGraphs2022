A Mansion In Darkness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Riding up the alley in the rain
No lights to show the way
How could this ever be their home?
Through the darkness you could only see
A giant shadow that swells to be
A house where evil rules at night

[Chorus 1]
And the shadows at the gate
They seemed to be alive
Yeah, the shadows at the gate -- alive
[Verse 2]
Everything inside was left untouched
Except for what the rats had got
And the dust of time that showed its mark
Armed with candlelight and open eyes
Through the dark they fought their way
'Til every room was lit again....

[Chorus 2]
And the house began to breathe
It seemed to be alive
Yeah, the house began to breathe -- alive

[Verse 3]
As the candlelight began to fade
And Jonathan said, "Let's go to bed."
The fireplace had ceased to burn
Both were fast asleep before the dawn
Dreaming, dreaming
And they did not know about the shadow

[Chorus 3]
Yeah, the shadow on the wall, it really came alive
Yeah, the shadow on the wall -- Sunrise!You might also likeEmbed
