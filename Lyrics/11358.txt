Still Crazy After All These Years Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met my old lover on the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me, I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers

[Chorus]
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

[Verse 2]
I’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on old familiar ways
And I ain’t no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
[Chorus]
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

[Bridge]
Four in the morning
Crapped out, yawning
Longing my life away
I’ll never worry
Why should I?
It’s all gonna fade

[Verse 3]
Now I sit by my window, and I watch the cars
I fear I’ll do some damage one fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers

[Outro]
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these yearsYou might also like4Embed
