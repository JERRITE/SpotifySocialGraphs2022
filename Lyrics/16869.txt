[Verse 1]
You can have my love
You're the girl of my life
Am I all you're dreamin' of?
Yes, you're my desire
I wanna give you so much
For the things that you give to me
Just take my love, baby
Because you are so dear to me

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you want, baby
Whatever you need
There's nothing I won't do
And I say whatever you want (whatever you want)
My heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you

[Verse 2]
Once in a lifetime
You will find someone like you
And now that I have you
Here's what I'm gonna do (I'm gonna give you so much)
I will give you my all and all
Over and over again, lady, lady, lady
Lovin' you too much, baby
Is not, is not, is not a sin

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, baby
Whatever you want
There's nothing I won't do
And I say whatever you want (whatever you want)
My heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you

[Bridge]
Anything, anything, anything you want
I'll do it for you
In the morning
Whenever you want it (makes no difference)
In the evening (in the evening)
Whenever you need it (late in the midnight hour)
When the night falls (you know I got it)
You know that I've got it (pick up the phone and dial my number)
So baby, just call me (call me)
You know that I'll do it

[Hook]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, baby
There's nothing I won't do
And I say whatever you want (whatever you want)
My heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need
I'll be right here for you
Whatever you need
My heart belong to you
Whatever you need
There's nothing I won't do
I say whatever you want
My heart belongs to you
I say whatever you need9Embed
