Made love lately LyricsCome inside, I know what you want
Yeah, wait, before we do that
I just wanna tell you something
Jim Beanz, Day 26, are you listenin'?

Hello lady, I'm glad you came
I can tell you're on the same page
You want it like I do, ready to get into
Some good love
I'll let you have it, I'll make it last and-
You never know what's gonna happen next
This ain't your usual thing that you're used to-
Type of sex
Baby I love the way that you touch me
Tonight we're gonna set the stage, yeah
I just can't get enough, baby I'm burning up
But I just got one question for you baby
Tell me
Have you made love lately?
(Have you made love?)
I just wanna know if we can take a moment
To get it right, We got all night
(Got all night)
Have you made love lately
(Have you made love... tell me)
Have you made, (tell me)
Have you made, (tell me)
Have you made love

Oh. baby!
I just begin to experiment you
Baby I think I found the formula
There's so much energy, I feel the chemistry between us
From your reaction, I see the passion
This whole experience is something new
Long as I serve my purpose, wanna be of service to you, baby

Baby I love the way that you touch me
Tonight we're gonna set the stage yeah
I just can't get enough, baby I'm burning up
But I just got one question for you baby
Tell me!

There's not too many things that I wanna say
Actions speaks so much louder than words baby

Cause I just wanna take my time
And girl I wanna do you right, all night
There's one thing that's been on my mind
Have you baby, have you made love
