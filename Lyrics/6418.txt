Razzmatazz Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wait, don't hold your breath for goodness' sake
Nobody's home
But you've got parliaments filled with parasites, plus marquees with your name in lights
A star is born, and that's the trade for everyone you know

[Chorus]
Let's go paint the town on our way home
The blinking lights are breaking bones
Cast all your spells, and there you have
That good old fashioned razzmatazz
[Verse 2]
Oh, you broke my heart again
You climbed up on your ivory tower, and you paid off all my friends
And now, well some things just cannot be fixed with sparkled tongues and politics
In a fascist little paradox, we all become anonymous

[Chorus]
Let's go paint the town on our way home
The blinking lights are breaking bones
Cast all your spells, and there you have
That good old fashioned razzmatazz
[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
Let's go paint the town on our way home
The blinking lights are breaking bones
Cast all your spells, and there you have
That good old fashioned razzmatazz

[Instrumental Outro]

[Spoken]
