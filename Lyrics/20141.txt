She Told Me to Kill Myself Lyrics[Chorus: Smrtdeath]
She told me to kill myself
Like I haven't been working on it
I don't think it's real, I am
Wishing that I was dead every morning
Now I'm 'bout to feel myself
I've been gassing it, let's be honest
Baby I'm a real one, wo-o-ow
Imma do whatever, I'm living nonsense

[Verse: Lil Aaron]
She told me to die like I don't already want to
I lay awake at night thinking about shit that I can't undo
As long as I'm alive, got some money Imma run through
I'm just here for the night
Shawty told me I should come through
But, I don't wanna talk, just want a shot
Throw some guap, and get some top
I'm feeling hot, to the top
I ain't gon' stop, don't fuck with shawty she a not
I bet she gets that a lot
I bеt she gets that a lot
[Bridge: Smrtdeath & Lil Aaron]
Yeah, and I'm doing alright without you
I'm finе without you
Yeah, and bitch Imma shine without you
And die without you

[Chorus: Smrtdeath]
She told me to kill myself
Like I haven't been working on it
I don't think it's real, I am
Wishing that I was dead every morning
Now I'm 'bout to feel myself
I've been gassing it, let's be honest
Baby I'm a real one, wo-o-ow
Imma do whatever, I'm living nonsense

[Verse 2: Smrtdeath]
I've been working on dying
Like I made beats for Uzi
Tryna hurt me, I'm tryin' to
If I'm winning, I'm losing
Every time you hit my line
I'm like "The fuck are you doing?"
I left all that shit behind
Now they mad 'cause I'm movin'
But, none of it means anything
Lately I've been getting things
Lately I've been getting in
I get the check and let us in
Pockets full of 'phetamines
My fit it cost a wedding ring
I'm looking like a rock-o-rama
Boutta cop a seven string
You might also like[Bridge: Smrtdeath]
Baby to be real, you don't even know me like that
(know me like that)
Sethany like Rick Ross 'cause these hoes can't hold me back

[Chorus: Smrtdeath]
She told me to kill myself
Like I haven't been working on it
I don't think it's real, I am
Wishing that I was dead every morning
Now I'm 'bout to feel myself
I've been gassing it, let's be honest
Baby I'm a real one, wo-o-ow
Imma do whatever, I'm living nonsense2Embed
