Heart Vroken Lyrics[Chorus]
Fell the pain hard in my [?] yea
Always feel alone like I'm trapped in a cage
And my heart is in a maze that will never be found
Depression on my face and I'm always feeling down
Lay me down to rest is the only time I rest
Got a wand up on my chest
And the things that I would do you would never feel impressed
Hope you get the message now with a bullet in my chest
I hate youYou might also likeEmbed
