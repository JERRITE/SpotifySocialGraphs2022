One More Time (Klingande Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can break my heart
But you can't break my spirit, baby
When we fall apart
I will pick up the pieces, watch me

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin'
Watch me dance the night into the mornin'
Darlin', hold me
Like it was forever, darlin', hold me
[Chorus]
This is our last song, last night, last sunset
Last kiss, goodbye ain't done yet
Last song, last night, last sunset now
Then we'll do it one more time

[Drop]
Then we'll do it one more time
Then we'll do it one more time

[Verse 2]
You can shut the lights
But you can't take the sunshine from me
I'll be up all night
Makin' fire with every heartbeat

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin'
Watch me dance the night into the mornin'
Darlin', hold me
Like it was forever, darlin', hold me

[Chorus]
This is our last song, last night, last sunset
Last kiss, goodbye ain't done yet
Last song, last night, last sunset now
Then we'll do it one more time
Last song, last night, last sunset
Last kiss, goodbye ain't done yet
Last song, last night, last sunset now
Then we'll do it one more time

Then we'll do it one more time
Then we'll do it one more time

[Outro]
One more time
One more time
Ah
Then we'll do it one more timeEmbed
