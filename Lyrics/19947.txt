TOXIC PARADISE Lyrics[Verse 1]
Touch down in LA, im'ma need the pack
Hit the plug, call him up hollerin' "where you at?"
Next move, call you playing phone tag
Up-down, up-down, call me right back
Girl, you know that heavens overrated
And the angels honestly hate it
Gods strict, and he dont get faded
And he just can't fuck like satan
Two door with top laid back, let's go
I know that you can't give up much more
Baby come close, and lose your halo
Go on work it for the boy, yeah, let your horns show
Thirst for your love that I can't control
A pill on your tongue slides down your throat
I try, but I can't resist, it's on, and we can't stop
[Chorus]
Wasting away my serotonin to stay in toxic paradise, Oh-ho
I know that it's wrong, but I just love feeling numb
I'll be your sacrifice
Herе in toxic paradise

[Verse 2]
Hotel, 1 A.M. when I pullеd up
See the "do not disturb" when the door shut
Turn the lights down low pull the shades back
Inhale-exhale, try to relax
I'm the maelstrom that you created
I'm a monster, and I can't escape it
Disgusting, the way that I crave it
Graceless and contaminated

[Chorus]
Wasting away my serotonin to stay in toxic paradise, Oh-ho
I know that it's wrong, but I just love feeling numb
I'll be your sacrifice
Here in toxic paradise

[Bridge]
Exiting my body, I float through the ceiling
It hurts, but oddly I long for the feeling
I can't escape myself
Wish I was someone else
I'm scared that I'm losing my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Wasting away my serotonin to stay in toxic paradise, Oh-ho
I know that it's wrong, but I just love feeling numb
I'll be your sacrifice
Here in toxic paradise1Embed
