Play Stupid Lyrics[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Shawty made my other girl dip (Dip, oh, oh-oh, oh)
If I was to love her, she'd leave me with shit (Shit, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hey (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Uh
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Shawty made my other girl dip (Dip, oh, oh-oh, oh)
If I was to love her, she would leave me with shit (Shit, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Still tryna play Cupid
I don't play mind games, I don't play stupid (No, no)
We can take a ride in the Urus (Skrr)
Spend it all, I got more, don't even trip (Trip)
Last night we was too lit (Lit)
We don't have pics, but we was too lit (Yeah, too lit)

[Post-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Oh, oh, your body's perfection
You told me close the door

[Verse 1: Strick]
And you supercharge, way you keep the Lambo
I know the referee, I feel like I been ballin' too much
I was attendin' to the girl, I had no time at lunch
I get my heart the way I'm thumbin' through the money count
I'm tryna blink and see two commas in the Bentley
She new to Hollywood, and got her body adapted
Keep it G, even my backup bitches the action
I bossed up for all my ex or for my toxic

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Shawty made my other girl dip (Dip, oh, oh-oh, oh)
If I was to love her, she would leave me with shit (Shit, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Still tryna play Cupid
I don't play mind games, I don't play stupid (No, no)
We can take a ride in the Urus (Skrr)
Spend it all, I got more, don't even trip (Trip)
Last night we was too lit (Lit)
We don't have pics, but we was too lit (Yeah, too lit)

You told me close the door, hey

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Flexin' for the ice, yeah, wishin' for the shit
Flexin' for the shit, shawty movin' quickly
Baby, you can ride in the Lamborghini Urus (Skrrt)
Pics for the memories, but please don't post it (I'm toasted)
I won't show up with roses (Roses)
I told I wouldn't blow this
You changed your hair for me to notice
Girl, guess what I'm smokin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Shawty made my other girl dip (Dip, oh, oh-oh, oh)
If I was to love her, she would leave me with shit (Shit, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Still tryna play Cupid
I don't play mind games, I don't play stupid (No, no)
We can take a ride in the Urus (Skrr)
Spend it all, I got more, don't even trip (Trip)
Last night we was too lit (Lit)
We don't have pics, but we was too lit (Yeah, too lit)

[Post-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Oh, oh, your body's perfection
You told me close the doorEmbed
