Left Behinds Lyrics[Verse: Taylr Renee]
Cast me out, drug me through hell
Devil's ashes live under my nails
Where's the hope, belief in humanity?
Ask for a drink, strangers look down on me

[Chorus: Taylr Renee]
Fallen angel, that is I
I'll lead you all you left behinds
Now is ever do or die
Together, no man left behind
We are the left behinds
[Instrumental Drop: Paris Blohm]
We are
The left behinds

[Verse 2: Taylr Renee]
Metal hearts melted down
Pool of souls I wish to drown
Where's the hope, belief in humanity?
Ask for a drink, strangers look down on me

[Chorus: Taylr Renee]
Fallen angel, that is I
I'll lead you all you left behinds
Now is ever do or die
Together, no man left behind
We are the left behinds

[Instrumental Drop: Paris Blohm]
We are the left behindsYou might also likeEmbed
