Elevens LyricsEvery day day i wake up a new man
New eyes new heart new flesh new hands
Who guessed he’d get a little depressed in the summertime must be something wrong what the fuck is on his mind
Why is he by himself in the shade of an underpass
Drinking rum and whispering to someone who has come to pass
Press forward and fall back on your fantasies
Under grass under concrete jungle canopies
This a note to the people who just like me
The kripes road vicodin vipers it isn't likely I'd write the same song twice
Pick a day
Long night
Of staring at the ceiling gotta think away the thoughts like
Don't get invested
Show up on record scratch and focused on a boss fight he's hoping for a necklace
Choke it out a breakfast bet
This won't work if i don't catch a breath but it's worth this whole setlist i said it's all i have and i meant it
Man it's all a blur the volume is obnoxious
I pass out over texas
Drop kick
Gemani the lux and castor
Evidently my ship is sinking
So thirsty
Can't drink ship sinking faster
Say uncle
Chase the abyss
Don't call home fake the laughter
Everybody likes basic banter laced wit cantar
86 okay i'll break the silence
Uh
I remember being picked apart in grade school
Can't afford the shoes cause my dad just could pay for it had to feed the fam he was the last to take a plate or just didn't eat at all he just sat there and he prayed for us
Dont dont get it twisted with an sos i got next on the table im the best at chess because id sacrifice my people just to check the box and best of luck but don't let lester catch you
Heads up
Bitch face bit twisted backwards on a bust made of granite and a chisel made of plaster
Give or take a decade
Give up in a hour
I got sketches made of vision
I got vespers made of cowards im depression in a prism with a gesture when it showers
Heaven knows i'm tryin
Everybody doubting
Never set the limit i'm a precipice of sirens
All i want is happiness and everybody crying
See im 3 too short of the best that could ever be
And just 1 foot shallow to venture the seven seas
The rents a week late but never gon let us leave
Someone broke a promise
I hope i wasn't me it probably was though
See me in the corner on the ceiling playing tug rope
Read me off a chapter from the good book
Bleed me out a cut throat shut ya mouth
And don't look when they cut me down
Enough’s enough
Yeah
But that won't stop me
I didn't write a hook just cause everybody copies and i bet you never heard me when i said i got some problems you was ready to respond with some eccentric bit knowledge must of read up on the internet
I bet he went to college
I said you wouldn't get it
He said he couldn't bother
It's a mess
Hold me underwater
Hope i see you smile as i slowly go unconscious
Nope it not a testament to anything you said you ever wanted
I been on a bender since the crutch toons
Haven't spoke to trevor since we parted
Wrote myself a check and then departed
Won't you get undressed with me and party till the sun comes up and don't start me on some fuckin dedication shit while i've been working hard it looks like yall been on vacations its a monster
Ship is underwater
Now im sippin on the vodka just to tanic all the monsters i got
Have faith
Bro gimme a break
You got sympathy i see that but you need to relate i'm on a tooth for tooth level just to see what it takes it takes 16 years in a pyramid shapeYou might also likeEmbed
