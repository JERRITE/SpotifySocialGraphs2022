Everything I Ask For Lyrics[Verse 1]
She takes her time with the little things
Love notes reminding me (Reminding me)
She wears red when she's feeling hot (So hot)
I have her, but it's all I got
She looks best without her clothes
I know it's wrong but that's the way it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what she sees in me (She looking at me)
But I'm happy that she's happy now that she's with me
And I'm freaking out because I'm just so lucky
[Chorus 2]
Oh, she makes me feel like shit (It's always something)
But I can't get over it (She thinks it's nothing)
'Cause she's everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for and so much more

[Verse 2]
She loves music, but she hates my band
Loves Prince, she's his biggest fan
She's not big on holding hands
But that's alright 'cause I still got her
She keeps up on current affairs
Prada is what she wears

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what she sees in me (She looking at me)
But I'm happy that she's happy now that she's with me
And I'm freaking out because I'm just so lucky

[Chorus]
Oh, she makes me feel like shit (It's always something)
But I can't get over it (She thinks it's nothing)
'Cause she's everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for and so much more

Fistfights turn into sex
I wonder what comes next
She loves to always keeps me guessing (Guessing)
And she (She) won't (Won't) give it up
And we (We) both (Both) know
It's because

[Chorus]
Oh, she makes me feel like shit (It's always something)
But I can't get over it (She thinks it's nothing)
'Cause she's everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for and so much more1Embed
