Looking as You Are Lyrics[Verse 1]
I told the devil and the deep blue sea to hide
I thought that you were after them, I was right
But it's a picture I'll always keep in mind
Where you say I've never been even liked
For anything truly mine

[Chorus 1]
And you did it looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
[Verse 2]
Love enters and leaves you through your eyes
You threw away the only thing that I liked
And now to tell you that things will be all right
It never really seems that way late at night

[Chorus 2]
When you did it looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are

[Bridge]
And now I know, that the world's not waiting
For you, nor for me
And now I know that the world got heavy
Won't change

[Chorus 3]
'Cause you did it looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
Looking as you are
You might also like[Coda]
Now you're gone
I stand on my ownEmbed
