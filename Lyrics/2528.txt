TranslationsفارسیThis Is Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away", they say
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away", they say
"No one'll love you as you are", but

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I'm meant to be
This is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies
This is me

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Another round of bullets hits my skin (Eh)
Well, fire away 'cause today (Oh, oh)
I won't let the shame sink in (Eh, eh)
We are burstin' through the barricades
And reachin' for the sun ('Cause we are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become (Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't let them break me down to dust (Ah)
I know that there's a place for us (Ah)
For we are glorious

I am brave, I am bruised, I am who I'm meant to be
This is me
Look out 'cause here I come (Eh, eh, eh)
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum (Eh, eh)
I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies
This is me

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh; eh, eh)

[Bridge & Refrain]
And I know that I deserve your love
'Cause there's nothin' I'm not worthy of

Look out 'cause here I come (Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum (Marchin' on, marchin-marchin' on)
I'm not scared to be seen, I make no apologies
This is me
[Outro & Refrain]
(Whenever the words wanna cut me down)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Send a flood, gonna drown them out)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out, aye!
