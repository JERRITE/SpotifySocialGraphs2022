Mr. Writer Lyrics[Verse 1]
You line them up
Look at your shoes
Your hang names on your wall
Then you shoot them all
You fly around in planes
That bring you down
To meet me who loves you
Like me crashing to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you so lonely?
You don't even know me
But you'd like to stone me
[Chorus]
Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?
Why don't you tell it like it really is
Why don't you tell it how it really is
Before you go on home?

[Verse 2]
I used to treat you right
Give you my time
But when I'd turn my back on you
Then you do what you do
You've just enough, in my own view
Education to perform
I'd like to shoot you all

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you go home
With you on your own
What do you really know?

[Chorus]
Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?
Why don't you tell it like it really is
Why don't you tell it how it really is
Before you go on home?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And then you go home
With you on your own
What do you even know?

[Chorus]
Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?
Why don't you tell it like it really is
Why don't you tell it how it really is
Before you go on home?1Embed
