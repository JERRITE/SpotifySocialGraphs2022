Robbery Part 5 Lyrics[Intro]
She lost all her memory, she lost all her memory
(J-J-J-J-JR)
Damn

[Verse]
I have a seat
Look in her eyes, I'm like, "You don't remember me?" (Me)
She noddin' off, can't really talk, she still weak
I'm feelin' relieved, I take my hand off my heat
The cop like, "When the last time you saw her, sir?" (What?)
I give him a card like, "That's my lawyer, you can talk to her"
Said the "L" word to him, now he feel defeated (Lawyer)
Hе like, "Bet, herе's my card if you ever need it" (Alright)
The doctor look at me like, "Sir, I know you grievin'
But she need her rest, she just got out of surgery this evenin'"
I'm like, "Doc', listen, she won't forgive me if I leave
You won't even know I'm here, she made me promise, then agreed" (Bet)
Now for a whole month, we been kickin' it with each other (Catchin' up)
The doctors finally tell her she can leave, she recovered
She look at me like, "I know I don't remember nothin'
But one thing I remember is I never had a brother" (What?)
"So who are you? Why you been here more than my mother?" (Listen)
I said, "Listen, I been here because I love you" (I love you)
"We ain't never get married, but, baby, I'm your husband" (We didn't)
She like, "Your energy familiar, I knew it was somethin'" (Knew it)
"You got me out of situations, for that, I'm grateful" (Grateful)
"Gon' always be with you and that's my way of sayin' thank you"
She like, "Boy, you stood by my side, I appreciate you
Gon' always be your woman, I'm gon' always be faithful" (I know)
And she ride every time I ride (Every time)
I made it out and she survived, you can't question God (That's crazy)
And you a vibe, they ain't fuckin' with you in my eyes (At all)
And as long as I'm alive, need you by my side
You with me? Let's get it (Let's do it)
All that street shit behind now (Behind now)
Startin' a family my full-time job now (That's my job)
I'm out here tellin' hoes the truth, ain't no more lyin' now
I got a bitch, so play the side or get timed out (Or get cut off)
Matter fact, why fuck with all these bitches when you got a queen?
And I ain't missin' nothin', she do everything
Nigga, I'm wide awoke with the girl of my dreams
Make it official, then my happy ending gon' be complete
Next day, I went out and bought a wedding ring (A big one)
This gotta be my wife, she survived and she set me free (Let's get it)
Before I got on one knee and said, "Marry me"
She pulled out a gun like, "Nigga, I remember everything"
[Outro]
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
I remember everything
