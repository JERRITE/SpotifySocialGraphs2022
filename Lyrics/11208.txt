Canâ€™t Nobody Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you, baby
'Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

[Chorus]
Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do, oh
[Verse 2]
I'm going to love you in the morning
Love you late at night
I ain't going to stop loving you
Till you tell me everything's alright, oh

[Chorus]
Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

[Verse 3]
Can't nobody kiss you
(Can't nobody kiss you)
Like I'm kissing you right now, little girl
'Cause they don't know how to kiss you like I do

[Verse 4]
And there ain't nobody that can talk to you
(Can't nobody love you)
Like I'm talking to you right now
'Cause they don't know how to talk to you like I do

[Verse 5]
Listen now
Sam bought you cake and ice cream
Called you cherry pie
Ray Charles called you his sunshine
But you're the apple, apple of my eye, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how to love you like I do
No they don't know how to love you like I do1Embed
