First Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the darkness
All I see is you, you
When I'm lost, you lead me home
It's true, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
Yeah, it's hard to run away
[Chorus]
(Ooh) Feels like we're falling for the first time
(Ooh) This is exactly what it feels like
When I can't go to sleep unless you're lying next to me
(Ooh) Feels like we're falling for the first time

[Drop]
(Ooh) Feels like we're falling for the first time
(Ooh) Feels like we're falling for the first time

[Verse 2]
I, I knew that you were worth it
I don't know if I deserve this
You have given me a purpose
You, yeah, you were always worth it
I, I know that you're worth it
I don't know if I deserve this
You have given me a purpose
You, yeah, you were always worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
It's hard to run away
