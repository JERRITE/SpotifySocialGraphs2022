Put It In Lyrics[Verse 1: Bobby V.]
I don't usually say this
Yeah, do "Just playing"
Let me see what's up
Well, now something got me loose, fill it up
We can go all night long
I love bumping, not talking about the iPhone
You look right girl, I know you down
Turn it from around

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V.]
Swing em up, baby you'll be saying "Don't stop"
And when we about to finish, you tell me "Get on top"
Be real
We are
Girl, I gotta get five stars, no playing
Just talking to you got me saying
[Chorus: Bobby V.]
Imma put it in (Naked)
Put it in
Imma put it in
I ain't joking girl, why you're playing?
Imma put it in (Put it in that)
Put it in (Put it in that)
Imma put it in
I ain't joking girl, why you're playing?

[Verse 2: K. Michelle]
See, I don't usually say this
Hold your hands, we gon' get x rated
See, this song tonight is for a special guy
That's right here, is "On the next to" right?
Imma change it up, instead of talking I'm gon' show it
Put your hands on my thighs, we'll go all night in slow motion
We speed it up
Took the pat like ladies club
Make moves, come back to my place
I gonna do something on that straight laze
We can go all night, all night, all night
I'm just saying, uh
Stop tripping boy, why you're playing?

[Chorus: K. Michelle]
I tell to put it in (Baby)
Put it in
I tell to put it in
I ain't joking boy, why you're playing?
I tell to put it in (All in, yeah)
Put it in (All in, yeah)
I tell to put it in
I ain't joking boy, why you're playing?

I wanna make love to you
Wanna make love to you
Wanna make love to you
Boy, I wanna make love to you
Wanna make love to you
Wanna make love to you
Let's go

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby V. & K. Michelle]
Swing em up, baby you'll be saying "Don't stop"
I'm gon' have you begging for more
'Cause girl, I wanna give it to you
Boy, I wanna give it to you
Imma freak that body all night

[Outro: Bobby V. & K. Michelle]
Imma put it in (Baby)
Put it in
Imma put it in
I ain't joking girl, why you're playing?
I tell to put it in (Put it in that)
Put it in (Put it in that)
I tell to put it in
I ain't joking boy, why you're playing?
I tell to put it in (All in, yeah)
Put it in (All in, yeah)
I tell to put it in
I ain't joking boy, why you're playing?Embed
