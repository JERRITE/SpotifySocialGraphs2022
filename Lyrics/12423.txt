That Day Lyrics[Verse 1:]
In my DNA the one that TNA
A girl video fine could win VMA
And I remember, last June these girls barley had class never pass noon
With you I payed to the details cause your a female
That's gonna prevail, you said don't get attached you’re not a email
And love is known to suffocate spreet well
You said boy I hope that you gon' listen I ain't looking for a man
Nobody is missing I don't wanna fall in love, hope you like fishing
That’s just on a real tryna’ tell you how I feel I said
Its cool you playing by your own rules
And we can drink until we blackout blown fuse and catching feelings no
They not contagious but now lets just get between the covers like bathers
[Hook:]
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply

[Verse 2:]
How’d password yeah you got me open
In this last couple months well it got me hoping
Maybe we can make this thing exclusive I mean I'm cool with just sitting there, Abusive, but maybe we make a change like a fashion show
You said when when my boyfriend’s cheat I'm the last to know
I've been brokenhearted it wasn’t even they said they wouldn’t even know they always end up leaving, deceiving
End up looking like a fucking fool cause everybody will know
About that shit around school so we gotta’ be friends or this shits
Has to end cause I promise I will never go do it all again.. Damn

[Hook / Bridge:]
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply
You might also like
[x2]
When your lips are on my lips
And our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run

[Verse 3:]
Now I’m all yours and you're all mine
I know that I took time
But look how far we've gone
Laying in this bed a place to my head
I still remember what you said (x2)

[Hook / Outro:]
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in loveEmbed
