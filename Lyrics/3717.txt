Late Night Feels Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if we go missin'?
Turn off both our phones
Making bad decisions
Do some things we won't
Do it when they listenin', yeah
Proof's in kitchen, mm
We're the only witnesses
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-ooh-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve
You're my ideal
I know you got taste, like
If Gucci made cakes, right
I'd take two, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels, I want you, baby
Know what you do in those late night heels
Late night heels, yeah, ooh-ooh
Shawty, can I meet you in the lobby?
You know we ain't waitin' for nobody
Know what to do with these latе night feels
Late night feels, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Late night heels, late night heels
Yеah, ooh-ooh
Late night feels, late night feels, ooh

[Verse 2]
We've been livin' in that midnight life
Sippin' with the same things in mind
It's true
Woah-oh-woah, yeah
They've been telling me I'm wasting time
With my hands around your waistline
Not true
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve
You're my ideal
I know you got taste, like
If Gucci made cakes, right
I'd take two, ooh-ooh-ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels, I want you, baby
Know what you do in those late night heels
Late night heels, yeah, ooh-ooh
Shawty, can I meet you in the lobby?
You know we ain't waitin' for nobody
Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Late night heels, late night heels
Yeah, ooh-ooh
Late night feels, late night feels, oohEmbed
