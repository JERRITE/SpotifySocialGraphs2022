Sheâ€™s So Lovely Lyrics[Chorus]
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

[Verse 1]
Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you
[Verse 2]
From the way that her eyes are shaped
And it's making me sick
With her head on my shoulder
Waking up baby just to believe

[Bridge]
For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner

[Chorus]
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

[Chorus]
She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

[Verse 1]
Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is stay away from youYou might also like1Embed
