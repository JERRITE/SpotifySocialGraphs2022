Imaginary Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, how you doing?
I haven't seen you around
Your mouth is moving
Superficial sound
Let's get together
Act like we care for a while
It's been forever
I don't really mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I, blank staring faces
I make it to fake it
[Chorus]
When I'm hanging with my imaginary friends
All we ever do is smile and play pretend
Nothing to give, nothing to get
Only exist inside of my head
Imaginary, imaginary friends

[Verse 2]
We go out talking
You're still obsessed with yourself
Wish I was walking
Back into my shell
Cause every time I think it's different
You come around just working the same shit
Like you're someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
I, blank staring faces
I fake it to make it

[Chorus]
When I'm hanging with my imaginary friends
All we ever do is smile and play pretend
Nothing to give, nothing to get
Only exist inside of my head
Imaginary, imaginary friends

How does it, how does it, how does it feel?
When nothing, when nothing, when nothing's real
How does it feel? How does it feel?
How does it feel? How does it feel?3Embed
