TranslationsEspañolSOMEONE’S SOMEONE Lyrics[몬스타엑스 - SOMEONE'S SOMEONE 가사]

[Verse 1: Shownu, Joohoney]
Maybe this is crazy, crazy just to wonder
Wonder if there's someone meant for you
Sunshine when it's raining, raining over lovers
Lovers in the shade of color blue

[Pre-Chorus: Kihyun]
Is there someone to give it all?
[Chorus: I.M & Kihyun]
We all wanna be someone's
Wanna be someone's someone
With somebody we can't live without
We all wanna be someone's
Wanna be someone's someone
Someone we can't live without

[Verse 2: Hyungwon, Minhyuk]
Sick of being perfect, perfect with no reason
Reasons are for people you're meant to lose
Someone full of secrets, secrets in the shadows
Shadows with excuses breaking through

[Pre-Chorus: Kihyun]
But is there someone to give it all?

[Chorus: I.M & Kihyun]
We all wanna be someone's
Wanna be someone's someone
With somebody we can't live without
We all wanna be someone's
Wanna be someone's someone
Someone we can't live without
Someone we can't live without
Someone we can't live withoutYou might also like11Embed
