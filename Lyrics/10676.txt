Sneaky Link Chicago Lyrics[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Baby park down the street
Let’s be discreet
They can’t see this double R
You my freaky freak
I ain’t trying to lose you
‘Cause I choose you
You don’t fuck me for no money
I amuse you
Hitting it from the back
Just like that, I abuse you
Give no fuck about no niggas at all
But I accuse you remember
Know them other suckas got no money
So they use you
Remember me going beserk off them percs
That’s what them blues do
You know that pussy tight
So it hurt made you twerk before work
Hit that wall til it urk
Make you squirt, I’m a jerk
I ain’t nеver hit no shit
Ain’t let me spin, that’s my turf
Hеr bare minimum she good
I spend a fin that’s her worth
[Chrous: HXLLYWOOD]
Girl, I can be your sneaky link
We sneaky, be your sneaky
Girl, I can be your sneaky link

[Verse 2: Queen Key]
You trying to be my man
You already know key can’t fuck fans
You already know key fucked your friends
You already know key can’t pretend, yeah
Play a nigga like a band
Cut a nigga off same day bought a benz
Cut a nigga off same day rebrand
Ion want to talk if a nigga ain’t paying
Bitch, I got that crack if he it from the back
He gone get attached like a track
Eat me from the back, pussy fat like a cat
Pussy on his face, my shit act like a tat
That bitch had to pack ’cause he act like a rat
Bitch, you can’t be my sneaky link
What the fuck you think, nigga
What the fuck you thought
I’m a fucking boss you
Bitch, you got to pay the cost
Eat my pussy off
Ain’t my fault that bitch exhausted
‘Cause her nigga lost it

Ain’t no stupid, I got stupid
I can’t love no bitch, no cupid
Shorty slide just like she Nike
I call her and she just do it baby
Shorty kind of crazy trying to get up in my pants
Say she trying to have my baby
But plan B the only plan

[Chrous: HXLLYWOOD]
Girl, I can be your sneaky link
We sneaky, be your sneaky link
Girl, I can be your sneaky link
We sneaky, be your sneaky link
Girl, I can be your sneaky link
Sneaky link, sneaky link, sneaky link
Yea, I’m your sneaky link
What baby park down the street
They can’t see this double R
You my freaky freak…Embed
