Faceless Angel LyricsFaceless angel hitchhikes through the rain
Trying to get back to the place from which he came
Fallen brother, forever on the run
It’s been that way since his time had begun

Faceless angel, footsteps in the snow
Faceless angel, where - where do you go?

Faceless drifter sleeps beneath the moon
Lays his head down where the blackest flowers bloom
Forgottеn lovers passing in the street
They spеak of magic in a world that can't be seen
Faceless angel, footsteps in the snow
Faceless angel, where - where do you go?

Faceless angel, footsteps in the snow
Faceless angel, where - where do you go?You might also likeEmbed
