Beat Drop Lyrics[Intro]
Let the beat drop

[Verse 1]
Time to round them up
And tell them where we're gonna go
If they don't know how to work it
Then I'll leave them at the door
Got to make it to the center of the circle
Grab my hand
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band
[Chorus]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Yeah, it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told it to you once
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band

[Verse 2]
So give it to me baby
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
Gonna give it to me dirty
Out where everybody sees
'Cause I can't do nothing with you
If you're never gonna dance
So you'd better find some rhythm
'Cause they're playing "Bad Romance"
(Want your bad romance)

[Chorus]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Yeah, it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told it to you twice
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band

[Chorus]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Yeah, it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told you three times
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band

[Chorus]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Yeah, it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told you four times
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band

[Bridge]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I said it five times
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking band
[Outro]
Let it in your body
And the party won't stop
Yeah, it's seven kinds of naughty
When you let the beat drop
I told it to you once
I said "why don't you understand?"
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Tell the DJ drop the beat
Drop the beat
Don't play some motherfucking bandEmbed
