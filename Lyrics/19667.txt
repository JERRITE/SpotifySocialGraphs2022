Run My Shit Remix Lyrics[Intro: Merkules & Mindflip]
Oh, no
Mindflip, I don't think they realize, man, they had it coming to 'em the whole time
It's big Merk, but you knew that already
Let's fuckin' do this, homie
Look

[Chorus: Mindflip]
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down
[Verse 1: Mindflip]
They tryna tell me how I'm supposed to roll
The same people bendin' over, chokin', overdosin'
You could'vе learned your lesson 'forе you dove your nose in
All my shit and started acting like you knowin' the motion
I came to bring it like it's back in the day
Ahead of my time, though, 'cause I've seen the past of the day
Been moving pronto even though we passin' the blaze
Still on my grind, stackin' paper, slowly packin' the safe (Woo)
I got it covered, man, I'm doing my thing
But still these motherfuckers hate and try to ruin my game
But they been doing me a favour when they using my name
Just like a free labour working as I cruise into fame (We get up)
You ain't gon' see me tryna hop on these frauds
And kill the music for the purpose of just topping these charts (Hey, no)
Cats ain't writers, they shopping their bars
And must have got it all on sale 'cause what they dropping ain't hard (We get up)

[Chorus: Mindflip]
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down

Y'all ain't fuckin' with this, I'm really runnin' my shit
They want war 'til I'm out front of they crib dumpin' the clip
Don't forget to throw this song on when you jump in the whip
And tell these rappers when they see me I ain't bumpin' no fists, nah
We cross country, Vancouver to Montréal
I'm a pitbull and all of these dudes are just puppy dogs
Why's everybody look at me funny like something's wrong?
'Cause I don't mean Reeboks when I promise to pump you off
Look, me and Mindflip are like 6'5'' and they 5'6''
I'm sick, I see in the future, I'm like a psychic
I spit a verse and like twenty rappers have died since
Try this, pick a new genre that you can vibe with
I'm bringin' terror, I'm chillin', listenin' to Simple Terror
I move the needle, my shit is dope, man, it isn't sterile
I'm still a hero, my verses smoother than Aloe vera
And I'm the reason it's hard for you to look in the mirror
It's Merk

[Chorus: Mindflip]
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down
Homie, I get up, I run my shit
Really, I don't give a fuck
Y'all don't run me up, so mind your shit, right
You ain't never had a clue how shit get down
[Outro: Mindflip]
Yeah, shit ain't over, man, I swear
People try and tell me I can't do this shit, man, haha
Y'all trippin', manEmbed
