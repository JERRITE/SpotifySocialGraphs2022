Had to Fall in Love LyricsWhat mattered to me
Was the right to be free
Like I'll be someday
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way

The places I've seen
And the road in between
Make me wonder why
I'm searching for my dreams up in the sky
I heard the call
And in the mirror
I saw the writing on the wall
And I had to fall
In love with you
The face that I've known
Seems so lost and alone
When you're far away
I'm comin' for you baby right away

The places I've seen
And the roads in between
Make me wonder why
I'm searching for me dreams up in the sky
I heard the call
And in the mirror
I saw the writing on the wall
And I had to fall
In love with you

What mattered to me
Was the right to be free
Like I'll be someday
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the wayYou might also likeEmbed
