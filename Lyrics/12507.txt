Cult Logic LyricsAll my life I've been the slave of consequence
Wondering how this life could be so intricate
I wanna rewrite my heart and let the future in
I wanna open it up and let somebody in

Can you free me from the logic that I knew?
I'll believe it even if it is not true

Am I falling asleep on my feet again?
I call out - is anybody listening?
And it's like I'm diving into emptiness
But at least there is something beating in my chest
Can you free me from the logic that I knew?
I'll believe it even if it is not trueYou might also like1Embed
