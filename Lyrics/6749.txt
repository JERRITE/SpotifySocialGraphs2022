Moments Lyrics[Verse 1]
Met you in a crowded room
Yeah and I kinda wish I didn't notice you
I could've saved myself from this
And I guess I kinda talked a lot
I talk when I'm nervous and yeah you were hot
Knew then you'd be something that I'd miss

[Pre-Chorus]
And my friends just love asking what we are
And all I think about are nights spent in your car
And all I can say
[Chorus]
I had him for a moment
Then I didn't
I wasn't what he wanted anyways
Don't got a name for it
I had him for a moment
And I loved it
Wasn't long but it feels like it was something
There's no way to it
And I don't know what to call it
But at least I got moments

[Verse 2]
You're out with someone new
Loving your life whilе I'm kinda blue
And Claire said she kinda looks likе me (Ouch)
And that's what hurts the most
I can't call you my ex but I knew we were close
You gave me nothing I could keep

[Pre-Chorus]
And my friends just love asking what we are
And all I think about are nights spent in your car
And all I can say

[Chorus]
I had him for a moment
Then I didn't
I wasn't what he wanted anyways
Don't got a name for it
I had him for a moment
And I loved it
Wasn't long but it feels like it was something
There's no way to it
And I don't know what to call it
But at least I got moments
You might also like[Bridge]
And I wonder what you call me now
But I never wanna ask around

[Chorus]
I had him for a moment
Then I didn't
I wasn't what he wanted anyways
I don't have a name for it
I had him for a moment
And I loved it
Wasn't long but I know that it was something
There's no way to it
And I don't know what to call it
But at least I got momentsEmbed
