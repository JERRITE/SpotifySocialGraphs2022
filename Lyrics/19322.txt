[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she could be up
Oh, she could be down
But I'm not around to see her (Hey)
Oh, she could be up
Oh, she could be down
But I'm not around to see my baby
[Chorus]
To see my baby, to see my baby
I need my lady, she thinks I'm crazy
To see my baby, to see my baby
I need my lady, she thinks I'm crazy

[Verse]
I know she wanna ride with my niggas
But she can go get high but not with us
I'm gonna take that ass aside then fuck with her
I'm gonna get you in your thighs in the, in the,in the (?)
How could you forgive me, babe
How could you forgive me
I gave you (?)
I can get you wet instantly
Know you can't forget it
Baby girl I'm waiting for a minute
So get here on me
And I'm lonely
Baby girl, you got it for me
Baby girl, you know you know me
Better than I know my homies
'Cause you kept it real with a nigga
And now you tryna chill with these bitches
And I don't ever wanna keep you with no other bitches
Only mine girl, you're mine girl
And I really wanna kick it, I will miss you
But you're mine girl, so bye
