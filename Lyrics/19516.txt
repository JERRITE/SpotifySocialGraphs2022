Floats My Boat Lyrics[Intro: Dave]
On the—, on the—, on the—
On the roof gettin’ high, high, high

[Chorus: Dave]
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)
[Verse 1: Carter]
I be after that half and half Arnold Palmer tea
I got your girl callin’ told me meet me at the beach
I’m hootin’ hollering at main street of the colony
Starlight was bright with her last night, now she’s calling me
The rules might bend or break, that’ll remain hidden
Like Roo throwin' down when Mary’s away on business
Back deck stairs flower dress long hair
Blurred nights but we still takin' care we rep the FAM
Wake up way too early get some and food and dine and dash
Too hungover to know the difference between this and that
Focused on how to open her up but approach her with class
Weekends lose their meaning, every evening like the last

[Chorus: Dave]
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)

[Bridge: Carter]
I can keep up with the tempo
(That’s right, he’s right, alright, let’s ride)
Now what you tryna get into
(Let's find some time tonight)

Yeah and Roo didn't forget to pick up the 750
Of dry gin from fifth ave liquors
Us kids are wavy waving at sweeties on the street
Sticker slap the FAM logo right upon the damn hood of a jeep
No cloud in the sky, but clouds in my mind
She with another man not wonderin' why
Comfortable surrounding never not a full stride
We’ll see your ass tomorrow so don’t call it goodbye

[Chorus: Dave]
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)
Blow my smoke in the sky, still ignorin' advice
On the roof gettin’ high (Sippin' on my SoCo)
Live it up till I’m dead, ignorance in my head
Fuck whoever you are (I do what floats my boat)

[Bridge: Carter]
I can keep up with the tempo
(That’s right, he’s right, alright, let’s ride)
Now what you tryna get into
(Let's find some time tonight)
[Outro: Dave]
Whats up ladies and gentlemen, this is the bright side
Bring your friends, and shut it down
I hope everyone's havin' a good time playin' it in summer of 2012
If it's summer of 2040, play this shit a little bit louder
Cuz we makin' timeless music man this is the fresh Aer movement
And if you don’t fuck with us that’s fine24Embed
