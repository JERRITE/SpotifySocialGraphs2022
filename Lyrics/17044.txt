Crying Over You ‚óê Lyrics[Verse 1: HONNE]
You don't mean to be a problem
You don't mean to cause me pain
You don't mean to do much but they're, they're one and the same
I don't know where this came from
I thought we were plain sailing
This has taken me aback and it, it goes without saying

[Pre-Chorus: HONNE]
That I'm gonna feel broken for a bit
Life's gonna be a little bit shit
Oh, for at least the next week
We had our flaws, I'll be the first to admit
And we both struggled to commit
But oh, was it really that bleak?
[Chorus: HONNE & BEKA]
And I don't know why I've been crying over you
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know, just how much more I can go through
Man, oh man, I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

[Verse 2: BEKA]
I don't mean to be a problem
I don't mean to cause you pain
Don't wanna break it off, but there's no other way
You're not the only one who's hurting
Or who's finding this hard
But you gotta admit that we're drifting apart

[Pre-Chorus: BEKA]
Look we're gonna feel broken for a bit
And it's gonna be a little bit shit
But you'll find the strength when you're weak
You'll find a love when you least expect it
It could be any minute
So don't fight the tears on your cheek

[Chorus: HONNE & BEKA]
And I don't know why I've been crying over you
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know, just how much more I can go through
Man, oh man, I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

(Don't mean to be a problem)
I've been crying over you
(Don't mean to cause you pain)
I've been crying over you

[Bridge: BEKA with HONNE]
You're not the only one hurting
And though I can't say when
I know love will find its way again, way again

[Chorus: HONNE, BEKA & Both]
And I don't know (I don't know) why I've been crying over you (Over you)
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know (I don't know), just how much more I can go through
Man, oh man, I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you
Man, oh man, I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you
Man, oh man, I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

[Outro: BEKA]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh11Embed
