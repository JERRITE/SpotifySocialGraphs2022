​miss u haven’t met u tho Lyrics[Hook]
Times-Times-Times change but I don't really care though
I've been laying low, time is moving kinda slow
Douse my wounds with a bit of rubbing alcohol
Driving back roads, miss you, haven't met you tho
Times change but I'm still alive, I guess
Brain chemistry whacked, yeah, I'm quite a mess
Kiss my wounds with a bit of rubbing alcohol
Driving back roads, miss you, haven't met you tho

[Verse]
Oh, been lonely, I'm sure you already know
This last week everyday we're on the phone
Not like me, usually I'm all alone
I'm so distant, always feel so tired and cold
Can't find home, lately I've been on the move
Ease my stress, yeah, that's what i need to do
To get out my head, and stop thinking 'bout myself
Complaining, really need to shut my mouth
[Hook]
Times-Times-Times change but I don't really care though
I've been laying low, time is moving kinda slow
Douse my wounds with a bit of rubbing alcohol
Driving back roads, miss you, haven't met you tho
Times change but I'm still alive, I guess
Brain chemistry whacked, yeah, I'm quite a mess
Kiss my wounds with a bit of rubbing alcohol
Driving back roads, miss you, haven't met you thoYou might also like1Embed
