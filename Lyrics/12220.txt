All or Nothing Lyrics[Chorus]
All or nothing
Half a love never meant shit to me
If your heart never could yield to me
It's all or nothing
Cause I would much rather be lonely
Than waste time baby, don't you agree?

[Verse 1]
Please don't bring your lips so close
Don't smile or I'll get lost
My heart might grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell for the spell of your call
I'd get lost in the undertow
And that's why I gotta say no
[Chorus]
All or nothing
Half a love never meant shit to me
If your heart never could yield to me
It's all or nothing
Why cry for somethin' that might have been?
If it's love there is no in between

[Verse 2]
Clarity, this morning I had an epiphany
See I've been runnin' from reality
But now I just need some stability
See, baby, I belong to nobody
I only speak out of sincerity
And now it's clear that your case is charity
So please don't ask me why I gotta leave

[Chorus]
All or nothing
Having love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
It's all or nothingYou might also like6Embed
