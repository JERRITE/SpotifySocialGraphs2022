Help Me God Lyrics[Intro]
The help, help
The help of almighty God
I know, I know I can be— can be strong
I know I can be— can be strong

[Verse 1]
Extremists, take everything to the extremest
Alfredo at the top of the crop, I'm where the cream is
Yeah, swords swingin' over my head, under my kingship
Hah, madame cum laude when shawty bodied the dean's list
Huh, yeah, that means it's murder in the first degree
The universe versus me
Ha, these verses took me further than most of the university
And you movin' like your Cadillac converter weak
Can't believe everything you read, it could be Burgundy
How we go to HBCU's and let 'em turn us Greek?
What if a nigga strike me, how can I turn a cheek?
Scour the room, look inside the mind of the Mona Lis', jeez
They say Jesus died at thirty-three
But he still alive, so did Nipsey die at thirty-three?
Huh, so look at threats as hyperboles
'Cause when you a God, you can't even take it personally
Come have some church with me
[Chorus]
Tell you not to fly
There will be no reason why
Gravity defied
Most of us won't even try
But, that don't justify
They gon' always criticize
Statue and you die
Stab you while you're still alive

[Verse 2]
Yeah, bring it, can't live without my iron, I'm anemic
Yeah, huh, red beam mean it's personal, business if it's the green shit
On the road less traveled through gravel, I picked the scenic
I really seen it
Madame cum laude when shawty bodied the dean's list
Huh, that means it's murder in the first degree
Mercy me, I see murder like Percy P
Leonidas vers the Persian fleet
You murkin' me, stay off the oxy, moron, that's like a Virgin freak
Knew that I would turn into somethin' how they was curvin' me
Haha, it's just me and my extendo, nigga, that means I'm thirty deep
Pussy, you know you heard of me
Black Kennedy ridin' with a Jacky-O
Huh, I see you niggas plottin' from the grassy knoll
You make a mil', your bros will be the first ones at the stove
But if your plans don't pan out , I bet your cats'll roll"
But if your plans PAN dont out, i bet your "casserole"
If your "PLANS" dont "PAN OUT", i bet your"cast" a "role"
Woah, El Chapo, I got tunnel vision
Just in case they tryna put me under prison
Competition, couldn't comprehend my compositions
Confidence is doin' it religiously 'til it becomes religion
Then it becomes tradition
You might also like[Chorus]
Tell you not to fly
There will be no reason why
Gravity defied
Most of us won't even try
But, that don't justify
They gon' always criticize
Statue and you die
Stab you while you're still alive

[Bridge]
Yeah, this a symphony for when Lucifer fell from heaven
Looked in the eyes of a Judas in use of a deadly weapon
But bless his heart, and life is hard, count every blessing
Through the ultralight, father, you see my hands stretchin'
He said, "Your arms ain't long enough to get 'em", that's Armageddon

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Tell you not to fly
Gravity defied
But, that don't justify
They gon' always criticize
Statue and you die
Stab you while you're still alive
[?]
Help me, help me
Help, ooh
Still alive1Embed
