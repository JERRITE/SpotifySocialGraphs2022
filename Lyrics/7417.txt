Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Solange]
I just wanna wake up to the suns in Saint Laurent
Hundred thousand dollars on the fronts, hella blunts
I just wanna wake up on ya thigh, on a yacht
Or in the Rolls that's rented, windows tinted
We call that big spendin', big spendin'
I'ma get back on my feet, give me a minute
I'ma feel this in my thighs, like he been in it
Young Simma, Young Simma, give me a minute

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Sun down, wind chimes
Break it down, one line, a line
Can't no see me, no flex, be kind
Dollars never show up on CP time

[Verse 2: Solange]
I just wanna wake up on CP time
Wake up to that nigga, leave he behind
Get a presidential suite, leave with they linen
In the Rolls that's rented, windows tinted

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Sun down, wind chimes
Break it down, one line, a line
Can't no see me, no flex, be kind
Dollars never show up on CP time
