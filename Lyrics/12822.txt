Best Tears Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shoot for the moon, dear
Straight-placed, stay grounded
Be unique, though you're the same here
Speak 'cise but sounded

And you, you shouldn't stare
At the light, that's where you're going to
Just keep moving and grooving to the sound of the beat
You'll get there in time unless you stop your feet
[Chorus]
Do smile and dry those eyes
So, all the girls and bad boys made you cry?
Well, you know, those were the best tears of your life
Of your life

Look cute in leather boots
And if makeup brings you down, just buy a noose
So at least you'll keep your head held way up high

[Verse 2]
Have some reserves, kid
Don't waste potential
Try your best, just like your father did
Success is mental

Please, show us and tell
How your life's not going straight to hell
All those jeepers and creepers wanna sit in your head
But fall out of line and you'll be shot and dead

[Chorus]
Do smile and dry those eyes
So, all the girls and bad boys made you cry?
Well, you know, those were the best tears of your life
Of your life

And if makeup brings you down, just buy a noose

[Outro]
Learn to smile as every good day goes on by6Embed
