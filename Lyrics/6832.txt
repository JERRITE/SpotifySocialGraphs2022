Sorry, I Can’t Talk Right Now LyricsSorry, I can't talk right now, man I wish I was on my way
Can I call you later some time? But I doubt you’ll wanna wait
I'm in the cut with the boys right now
We're all crying, it’s that time of day
It feels like that time of life, my friend, man you gotta just walk away

I can't get my head right
Tunnel vision with the end light
Was not a land slide
You know I promise, still not on top of things
I'd love to show my hand
Making bad habits, call me J. D. Salinger
Make bad impressions; Max Fischer from Rushmore
Tinkerbell, other side of the room
Cold night in the middle of June
When drinking they're seeing the devil in my eye
Are they my people, do I need disguise?
Never thought you'd betray, honestly, promised me, effortlessly
Obviously wasting my time
Sorry, I can't talk right now, man I wish I was on my way
Can I call you later some time? But I doubt you'll wanna wait
I'm in the cut with the boys right now
We’re all crying, it’s that time of day
It feels like that time of life, my friend, man you gotta just walk away

Yeah that's no shine on my wrist
For you I glowed a little bit more than I used to
But I can’t attach, you let me go and I can't come backup
I cannot see all the things that you want, sometimes I wish I was like everyone else
I'll wear the same grey for the rest of the month
I could try a new face out in public for once
But shit never goes to plan (Plan)
I could give her the world and she'd turn down my hand
I could make a few mill’ but I'd still be depressed
Could make a new friend; cut em off like the rest

Sorry, I can't talk right now, man I wish I was on my way
Can I call you later some time? But I doubt you'll wanna wait
I'm in the cut with the boys right now
We're all crying, it's that time of day
It feels like that time of life, my friend, man you gotta just walk away

Sorry, I can't talk right now, man I wish I was on my way
Can I call you later some time? But I doubt you'll wanna wait
I'm in the cut with the boys right now
We're all crying, it's that time of day
It feels like that time of life, my friend, man you gotta just walk away
