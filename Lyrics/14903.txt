Irresistible Force Lyrics[Verse 1]
We didn't know that it would blow up with such might
The stars are even brighter contrasted by the night
Sent out shock waves filled up the outer space
Even the ghost came to the late, late, late show watch us play

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything went tossing everyone was talking
Making up their faces wonder what we look like naked?

[Chorus]
Ah the irresistible force met the immovable object
Oh!
Ah the irresistible force met the immovable object
[Post-Chorus]
Banging and banging
And banging and banging and banging
Together

[Verse 2]
We've become a big business a galaxy merger
The two of us a big bang god is a real man
God isn't dead god isn't dead

[Chorus]
Ah! The irresistible force met the immovable object
Oh!
Ah! The irresistible force met the immovable object

[Post-Chorus]
Banging and banging
And banging and banging
And banging together

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ah! The irresistible force met the immovable object
Oh!
Oh! some may call me a lucky shot
No, no, no, but it was not
You might also like[Outro]
Banging and banging
And banging and banging
And banging and banging
Banging and banging
And banging and banging
And banging togetherEmbed
