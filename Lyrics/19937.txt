LONDON TO 1800 Lyrics[Chorus: Jackboy]
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yea
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yea

[Verse 1: BEXEY]
Can't take nothing from me, I promise
Flight from London to 1800
I'm wondering, why in the fuck have they got problems
Jealousy up in their eyes, I feel it when they watching
Rock him to sleep, yeah
I'm with the Z's, but I ain't sleeping
Like a blind lifeguard I cannot see shit
Boy you drown in the deep end
Mm riding round the city with Jackboy
Like the S up on the sniper gang logo you backwards
Acting like you got bricks hidden up in your mattress
Go pay your mums rent pussyboy you embarrassing
[Chorus: Jackboy]
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yea
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yea

[Verse 2: BEXEY]
Had him speaking through the wire like old school Kanye
Can't hear a word you say, heard ya fucking' jaw break
Unintentional masterpiece.. I left your Blood up on the pavement, boy you left The floor stained
Took my.. kindness for weakness it backfired
I let you sleep in my yard and I got your Racks high, you bit the hand that fed you, You ain't no vampire?
And now you're dead to me
Thank you for making me wiser
Demon inside uh.. I feel no threat on my life
Spirit protection I never needed a gun on my side
Smile in the face of death, cause if I'm gonna die
Then it's supposed to be, I'll see you in the afterlife

[Chorus: Jackboy]
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yea
On the road from London, couped up with a Z3, yeah
Got a four or som', tryna come kick it with me, yeah
Big Glock cocked on 'em, won't take nothin' from me, yeah
Late night drop on 'em, rock his ass to sleep, yeaYou might also like5Embed
