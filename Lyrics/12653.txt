Le Velo Pour Deux Lyrics[Verse 1]
Vampires never have to complain
Of living a dull circumstance
So let's all pretend that we are undead
In turn of the century France
I want the love on your wrist
Oh, give me the heart on your neck
And it would be fine
To spend my whole life
With you, together
[Chorus]
Parlez vous, or something like that
Le velo pour deux or something like that
And that's what I'll say to get you to ride away with me
Hey!

[Bridge]
Oh, it would be fine to spend my whole life
With you, on a bicycle built for two

[Outro]
Ahhh, ahhh, whoah, oh, oh!
Ahhh, ahhh, whoah, oh, oh!
Oh it would be so oh fine to spend my whole life
With you, on a bicycle built for twoYou might also like12Embed
