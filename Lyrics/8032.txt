Reason - Radio Edit LyricsWhen the puzzle connects
It's like you never forget
The way it's got to be
It's nobody's concern
Cause they don't know how it burns
When you're not here with me

So am I wrong up my way in the sky
Cause I can never deny
These feelings
How can I ever stop
When I don't want to give up
This is my reason
Reason (repeat)

Cause I get you, I get you
And you get me, you get me
It's that simple, It's that simple

Don't matter where we are
Cause we are never far

When the puzzle connects
It's like you never forget
The way it's got to be
It's nobody's concern
Cause they don't know how it burns
When you're not here with me

So am I wrong up my way in the sky
Cause I can never deny
These feelings
How can I ever stop
Ooh I don't want to give up

This is my reason
Reason (repeat)You might also likeEmbed
