Bury Me in Smoke Lyrics[Verse 1]
Windows are closing
Keep me locked away
No chance was given
To find myself today
My time of aging
Wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come
I'll know the reason why

[Chorus]
I have an escape
Alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have a reason
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die, bury me in smoke
[Verse 2]
Under the world
I wait for my fate
My soul is resting
Beneath my blissful haze
My time of aging
Wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come
I'll know the reason why

[Chorus]
I have an escape
Alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have a reason
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die, bury me in smoke
Smoke, bury me in smoke, smoke
Smoke, smoke, smokeYou might also like1Embed
