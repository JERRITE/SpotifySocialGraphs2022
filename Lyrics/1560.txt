Letting Go for a Little While Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's 7:30 and I'm late, they're calling at the airport gate
We are running out of time, I have to go and stand in line
I know you love me, but now it's time to let me go
And I know you're sad but please don't cry
After all it's not goodbye
We're just letting go for a little while

[Verse 2]
And with your final words you lied, when you tell me you'll be fine
You even faked a smile before I disappear behind the door
My heart is beating against the walls inside my chest
But I can go back anytime, after all it's not goodbye
We're just letting go for a little while
Ooh, for a little while
[Bridge]
I guess all that's left to say is I will miss you each and every day

[Verse 3]
Now as I stand here on my own, I'm filled with memories of home
And all the friends that I have known
I realise how much we've grown
It feels like only yesterday, that would walk down Butcher Lane
But I can go back anytime, after all it's not goodbye
We're just letting go for a little while
Ooh, for a little while

[Outro]
And I hope they know I will always hold them close
We're just letting go for a little whileYou might also like1Embed
