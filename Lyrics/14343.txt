Murphyâ€™s Law Lyrics[Verse 1:]
This Evolution
A string of atoms
Adam planted a single apple to sing this album
Do you think you have what it takes to shape the masses?
Do you have the strength to crack and break your ribs and make it happen?
Adam did it after all
Created Eve then added on
And now they kids are fishing for a frikkin' fission atom bomb
'at a boy that's the only answer after Martial Law
We been in rations for too long we'd rather face the wrath of God
Authorities have dropped the ball
Securing banks and not the law
The older generation praying so amen and inshallah
I've seen the vision through my prophet eye
And my oh my
I just hope you'll be alive to fly
Been living in outer limits without a limit around my mind
I copped a cloud with Stevie Wonder ribbon in the sky
Whoever said that Evolution was just a theory was clearly living in fear
My niggas started from an atom now we here
[Hook]
Fuck niggas
Fuck bitches
Get money
[X4]

[Verse 2/Bridge]
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed - no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust; it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
You should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you

[Verse 3:]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Hopes and dreams that got chopped in two
Categories I'm boxed into
Labels that limit the artist
Stealing the art, its larcen, opted into
I'm trying to be all opulent too
Weaving toxic air follicles
We kill money, oil, fossil fuels
My niggas win like they really ain't got to lose
Probably cause there really ain't a lot to lose
I'm from the land of base heads and prostitutes
I'm trying keep an old soul like Posdnuos
But folks sell their own soul like pass the noose!
All to be popping
Niggas can't read the fine print, I guess we de-evolve

[Verse 4]
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, Bible in my left
Pages flippin like an acrobat
Yall would say the pledge
I raise the fist above, the afro back
Type of niggas didn't have the guts to climb the Aggro Cragg
Aggravated agents, raided aggregators back to back
Tryna gage an elavated educated black to back
I was up constructing social studies, studies after math
Trash the status quo like it's Aftermath, Shaft the math
After hours after class, Apple Jacks and tackle task
'Fore I learn to fly, used to jump and try to tap the glass
Had to strap the jimmy for the game before I tapped that ass
Victor, called the game before she came and got attached to fast
Rappers think they changing shit by saying shit
Where the fucks yo action?
Look what happened to Lesane Parish, Hendrix, Marley, Michael Jackson
Caskets shattered, drugged up for killin' lies and spillin' truth
Just imagine what these mothafuckas tryna do to you

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
He's so cold, he's so cold
He's so cold, he's so cold
That's why you're loving him right now
Why you're loving it right now2Embed
