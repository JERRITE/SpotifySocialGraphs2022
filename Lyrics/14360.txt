Gotta Reason Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hung around here long enough
I've seen the smooth, but only caught the rough
I've got no reason
Ooh no, I've got no reason
Disco on the radio
I ain't got no place to go
I've got no reason
Ooh no, I got no reason

[Pre-Chorus]
But wait, see the new girl in town
Maybe I can show you round
Oh baby, let's generate some heat
[Chorus]
Gotta reason
Ooh now I've gotta reason

[Verse 2]
Hey hey, baby, you knock me out
You make me want to scream and shout
I've gotta reason
Now, I've gotta reason
You can make it all worthwhile
I like your face girl, I like your style
You've gotta reason
Ooh, now I'vegotta reason

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you look so good
I want to eat you up like food
Oh baby, let's generate some heat

[Chorus]
I've gotta reason
Ooh now, I've gotta reason

[Bridge]
Alright, let's go
Woo
Check it out, check it out yeah
Oh yeah

Ooh now, I've gotta reason
Ooh now, I've gotta

[Outro]

I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta
I've gotta reason, gotta

I've gotta reason, gotta
