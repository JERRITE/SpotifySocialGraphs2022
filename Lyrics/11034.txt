Role Models LyricsDave: I’ve been reminded that at some point I need to do an entire podcast as Morgan Freeman.

Rene: You did an ad read as Morgan Freeman on review.

Dave: Did I?

Rene: Yeah.

Dave:  All right.

Rene: I believe you did.
Dave: I don’t think that shipped, though. I hope that didn’t ship.

Rene: It might have shipped, I don’t know.

Dave: I do know that I think it was on review last week -- the ad read. I had to listen back to it and there’s an entire chunk of stuff that I said “you’re going to have to cut this” and you said “okay” and it’s all still there.

Rene: Was it funny, though? Because if it was funny, then I didn’t need to cut it.

Dave: Well it was funny, but it was like, potentially offensive. I think it wound up being okay, but it was borderline. And I’m thinking, hmm, I’m fine -- I don’t care if I offend people, but I don’t want to do it during the sponsor read.

Rene: Is that when we forgot to do Christopher Walken during the sponsor read?

Dave: I don’t think we’ve ever done Christopher Walken.

Rene: You keep forgetting our celebrity sponsor reads, Dave. It’s heartbreaking.

Dave: No. No, I think like, I accidentally offended Asian people or something. I don’t know. It was something like that.

Rene: Alright, well, you’ve got to pay better attention to that.

Dave: These things happen. I mean, nobody complained, so I figured it’s okay. And in fact, I even sent the audio of that read -- or no, I sent the time read to the sponsor and they said it was a great read. They really liked it.

Rene: Okay, good.

Dave: So I’m going to count it as a near miss.
Rene: Win column.

Guy: Wait, is this --

Dave: Near miss, not a win. It’s near miss.

Guy: Is this the show?

Rene: Alright, so officially starting the show.

Dave: Let’s call that follow up.

Guy: No, I was actually going to ask a question.

Dave: Do it.

Guy: No, no, no, it’s a meta-question. I’ll wait until after the show.

Rene: Alright.

Dave: Well now everybody’s going to wonder.

Guy: Yeah, well guess what, tune into the after show that we won’t ever release, so ha ha.

Rene: So many unreleased after shows.
Rene: Alright, Tim Cook did an op-ed for Business Week where -- there had been rumors that he’s been gay for years. But he came out and said it in Business Week and he did it for an incredibly good reason. He didn’t say it just, you know, just off-hand. He said it because growing up, he didn’t have role models and he wanted to make sure -- he thinks role models are a powerful thing and he wants to make sure people looking up that him being gay and a powerful CEO, he could be a role model to people. And I thought it was an excellently written editorial. I was really impressed with it.

Dave: It was vaguely “I’m not the hero you need, but hero you deserve.” It was good. It was like a -- it felt like this isn’t something he wanted to do because he wanted attention. It’s something that he wanted to do because he felt it was important because of the position he was it. Like it was a recognition of “well, I’m here, I should just tell you this thing now.” Or it seems like it’s absolutely right reason to do it.

Rene: The way he ended it was really nice. He said, “When I arrive in my office each morning, I’m greeted by framed photos of Dr. King and Robert F. Kennedy. I don’t pretend that writing this puts me in their league.  All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I’m doing my part, however small, to help others. We pave the sunlit path to justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.

Dave: Yeah. I mean, I guess it’s not my place to say right or wrong. I think any reason to tell people about yourself or to -- anytime you feel comfortable publicly disclosing things by yourself, that’s on you and there’s no right reason or wrong reason. But this is especially a right reason. It’s like his heart is not just in the right place, he’s doing this as almost a -- if not 100% as a service to others rather than a selfish endeavor and that makes it extra okay to me.

Rene: The scary part is he says in this, too, that by admitting this, he could be legally fired in many states of the country that he lives in.

Dave: Yeah, this seems like a -- not as an activist move, but they’re does seem to be a little bit of a hint of that.

Rene: He’s been a -- I can’t say he’s taken up -- what he and Apple have been very proactive in terms of inclusivity. They had the gay pride parade this year and they did the #ApplePride. And they’ve been supporting the civil liberties and I the, I think it’s called the Equal Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

Soroush: Yeah, it seems to fit in very much with a lot of the stuff Apple does including, like, the video about apps for blind people and other accessibility stuff they do. It’s definitely like part and parcel with that stuff, it feels.

Rene: That was in Georgia, so maybe we should introduce him, Dave.

Dave: Oh. Hey Soroush, who are you?

Soroush: I’m Soroush. Hi.

Dave: Oh. Hi.

(Laughter)

Guy: Problem solved.

Dave: What do you do over there, Soroush?

Soroush: I’m an iPhone app developer. I work for Genius, formerly known as Rap Genius.

Rene: The Genius Bar?

Soroush: The Genius Bar. I work for the Genius Bar. No, it’s an annotation platform. I make the app. It’s a pretty cool app. You should download it.

Dave: Do you can’t help me with this broken screen issue?

Soroush: The broken screen is on you, Dave.

Dave: All right.

Rene: The annotation app, you guys annotate things. Isn’t the Tim Cook thing up on Genius?

Soroush: The Tim Cook thing is up on Genius. We have annotations on that. It sort of started from rap music, and now has branched off to lots of other stuff. The Tim Cook thing has a handful of annotations on it. They are pretty cool. You can also find other things, like the Obama announcement today about net neutrality; we have that up on the site with annotations of what stuff means and what people think of it, so...

Guy: So...

Dave: I like things to be annotated.

Rene:  We’ll annotate Dave after the show. This is also, I mean, I don’t know what the decision making process went into this -- it seems -- and I don’t know if you want to say anything about this, Dave

6:30

Guy: I don’t think that’s necessarily accurate.

Dave: I agree.

Rene: It was him standing up.

Guy: Yeah, it’s a bit of a different thing. I mean while it, like -- I’m looking at a quote right now in the article and it says, “While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either until now. So let me be clear, I’m proud to be gay and I consider be gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.”

Dave: That was interesting phrasing, too. We can get to that in a minute.

Guy: Yeah. I personally liked it. We may different on that. I thought it was good. So no, I don’t think this is like, Tim Cook’s coming out and he’s been in hiding all this time. No, I think people close to him probably knew and it’s not of anybody else’s business, you know. I don’t talk about my sex life in a public way and --

Dave:  -- why not?

Guy: Why not? Because it was be a long f***ing discussion, that’s why.

Dave: I can teed that up for you.

Guy: But you know what I mean? It’s like, no, it’s private and it has no bearing on his job or the company or anything else. So in a lot of ways, it’s completely irrelevant. Where it is relevant is in the ways that he outlined, which is to say that, you know, he’s the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world. And to publically state that he’s gay sends a positive message to other people, despite the fact that he clearly seems to value his privacy.

Dave: He is the first -- please somebody correct me if I’m wrong -- the first Fortune 100 CEO to come out, right? It was Fortune something.

Guy: Yeah, I mean again, I don’t to -- close enough. Yes.

Dave: Close enough. Yeah, we’ll say close enough. The point being --

Guy: -- It’s very, very, very right, so I --

Dave: -- There’s a girth of strong role models in that sector for gay people of either gender, any gender.

Guy: Yes.

Dave: This kind of thing, it sets an example, it sets a bar in the same way that it echos so much of what the tech industry right is talking about with the way women in technology are being treated, where so much of it is, let’s find and elevate because we’re trying to give off the air of equality, but rather we want to set forth actual example of, like. It’s so hard to find great role models that when you can find them, let’s really cast a light on them.

Guy: Yeah, and I think that’s valuable. I mean, like I think you were just trying to say, it’s not you don’t want to put on airs or and I really dislike this word, but being deverous [spelled phonetically], like diversity.

Dave: Right, right.

Guy: I dislike the word because talking about diversity sort of is predicated upon the notion that there is a this fixed norm. You know what I mean? Would you say --

Dave: Or at least some kind of hero-normativity.

Guy: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You know what I mean? Like hey, let’s be diverse. There’s a gay guy. It’s like, well…

(Laughter)

Dave: Yeah he’s not the token gay CEO. He’s was a very accomplished, extremely successful and by any accounts, by anybody who’s paid any attention to Apple’s history, an incredibly effective -- like so much of Apple’s success today is ode to the work that he’s done over the last, however long he’ been at Apple. He’s been a huge part of that long before the world knew about this. So theres no question, I think. There’s no sane person, nobody with any knowledge of how Apple works or what the trajectories been like since Steve came back, would look at Time and say that he hasn’t earned his place in history regardless of his sexuality.

Guy: Oh yeah, right. For sure.

Dave: And I think that’s important. This isn’t that he’s getting attention like, hey, some CEO announced that he’s gay and now he’s getting all this press to him. It worked the other direction, where sort of -- I hate to use a word like this, but it kind of legitimizes it.

Rene: He didn’t do it to get attention on himself. He did it to get attention on something that mattered to him a lot.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Yeah and --

Dave:  Really easy for detractors if it had gone the other direction. If this were a smaller company or somebody you’d never heard of, it would be really easy for detractors to say that it was just somebody looking for attention or this was a political move. Where this really feels like long before the world knew about this, so.

Guy: Yeah because I mean, for the point, this didn’t really get a lot of news coverage. I mean, it got coverage, but this -- it’s not like it did a whole news cycle and it’s like, “Wow, holy sh**, we can’t believe this.” Like, ground shaking stuff. Yeah.

Guy: It was more like, “Oh yeah, okay. We got it. Moving on.”

Rene: Yeah because we all kind of looked at each other like, “Well, yeah.”

Dave: There was some --

Guy: Well yeah, I mean we all knew. I mean, well, you know, it had been talked about for a long time.

Dave: Yeah, it wasn’t a surprise.

Rene: No, I forget who said it. It was someone on Twitter and forgive me, I don’t remember who it was. But there was some backlash and  there was some push back on it and it was really all --

Guy: -- on Twitter? Someone was being a jerk on Twitter?

Rene: No, but I think they made a point was --

Guy: -- Oh, stop the presses.

Rene: A couple months ago at Apple shareholder meeting a guy stood up and he said, “Why are you wasting money on accessibility and the environment?” And Tim Cook basically said because we believe they’re incredibly important and not everything’s about the bottom line and if you don’t like it, don’t own Apple stock. And the sort of response to this was the same thing. Like there was people saying well Apple was going to lose customers because of that. They’re not going to lose a single customer that they care because of this.

Dave: Right, right. And there were people on, I guess Twitter or Facebook because I guess there was a whole thing on Facebook about boycotting Apple.

Rene: And Google too because Google had two gay guys in their last commercial and some people were outraged.

Dave: Yeah, well I mean Apple’s commercials, the whole Justin Timberlake, Jimmy Fallon thing, that’s borderline.

(Laughter)

Rene: But there are --

Dave: But that’s a guy I love. But that’s a little different.

Rene: I think it’s fair to say those people are on the wrong side of history and looking back 50 years from 100 years, we’re going to be appalled at the way we treated humans the same way we’re appalled at how we treated them 100 years ago.

Dave: In St. Petersburg, they took down the Steve Jobs memorial because they were convinced that Apple was helping this spread gay propaganda.

Rene: Did they give back their Macbooks and iPhones?

Guy: I don’t know.

Rene: It seems like a very jerky public thing to do.

Guy: As a very small Apple shareholder, I would totally support them just pulling out of Russia. Really. F*** those guys.

Dave:The entire nation?

Guy: Well, I don’t mean the individual people, but I mean come on. If you’re going to --

Dave: -- Oh I agree with you. This is a -- whenever you go on your rants about the things America needs to do, I got ot roll my eyes a little bit. But I’d stand behind you on this one. Like come on Osha, get your shit together.

Guy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I do -- yeah, I mean, those are answered mostly in good fun. It’s like needling your brother, right? At that point.

Dave: But yeah, the whole Russia thing, it drives me nuts because we look at that country like, when me as an American, I look at an entire nation I’m like, too intolerant.

Soroush: And didn’t Tim Cook to go Russian and meet Putin or didn’t Putin come to Silicon Valley a little while ago?

Dave: Oh man, can you imagine Tim Cook lands in Moscow and is immediately arrested for being gay.

Rene: Yeah well that’s, I think, that sort of thing when you put them in those situations, it does highlight just how absurd some of the stuff is.

Guy: Well I mean up until, when was it -- a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago -- Tim Cook was the CEO of Apple to like arguably one of the most powerful companies in and he was not legally allowed to be married in his home state.

Rene: Yeah.

Guy: Which is mind boggling when you think about it.

Dave: I think this is the obvious comparison and the comparison people tend to make is the civil rights movement. I think that the civil rights movement happened at a time when that was still a new enough idea that you could kind of see why people had a hard time with the change. Like I’m not saying that they’re right. I’m not trying advocate for that position, but you could understand why at that point in history, people might see it the other way. Now this doesn’t feel like the civil rights movement because we f***ing know better. This is not a legitimate, reasonable position to be taking anywhere in the world in the year 2014.

Soroush: Right. We’ve been through the abolitionist movement, we’ve been through the suffrage movement, we’ve been through the civil rights movement, and it’s like, how many times do we have to do this?

Rene: How many times can we get this wrong?

Dave: Yeah, you’re not just on the wrong side of history, you’re so clearly on the wrong side of logic that it’s ah, there’s just no f***ing help for you people.

Guy: I wonder what the next thing's going to be. Like what are we --

Dave: -- AI rights?

Guy: AI rights maybe. I mean yeah, like --

Dave: Well I was going to go one step further because right now we’re talking just gay, but like transgendered and all these other things -- that’s going to be, I think, the next phase of this part of it. But like, what is the next thing?

Rene: Animal rights? Robotic rights?

Guy: Well I’m trying to think like, what would be offended as when we’re like 20, 30 years from now.

Dave: Android users.

Rene: We love our Android users.

Guy: Those guys need to go into gou leg [spelled phonetically].

Dave: They can already vote. I don’t know what else they’re going to get.

Rene: We’re getting to a point where, I mean, our tolerance level -- like there are some religions in which murder is okay and you know, we still don’t like those. So it’s not that we’re saying everything is fine, everything is dandy. We’re saying that you know, there's certain things we believe is human that transcend any particular background, culture, belief system, etcetera and we’re trying to get those things right.

Guy: Right.

Dave: I think if I’m going to off the cuff, straight out of my ass, bullsh** an answer to that question, I think maybe it’s politics. Maybe your political affiliation. We start self-selecting these things and it becomes we’ve run out of things to hate each other for. Like it’s no longer okay to hate each other for -- no longer considered reasonable to hate each other for things we can’t control, now we just focus on hating each other for things can’t control.

Rene: Terrible example of this, when I grew up, two of my best friends were Jamaican and their families would talk Jamaican politics a lot. And one of the things they told me because we were going to through the whole language debate in Quebec at the time, was that here we are, we come from an island that has terrific weather, most of us are the same cultural background, we all speak the same language, we all have the same religions, we kill over politics. I was like, humans have to find a way to be divided against each other.

Dave: We need an “us” and we need a “them”.

Rene: Well if Georgia was here, she could explain tribalism to us again.

Dave: Where is Georgia?

Rene: Secret assignment.

Dave: Oh.

Soroush: It doesn’t feel like this is about tribalism, though. You know, we’ve talked about sort of diversity or like falling on the right side of history and I think Tim Cook puts it pretty plainly. He just wants this to be for the people who don’t have someone to look up to.

Guy: Right.

Soroush: I don’t think there’s much else that you can pull from this specifically.

Dave: Oh, no we’re sort of like talking broadly about the issue.

Soroush: Certainly.

Rene: To that point though, Casey Newton on The Verge --

Dave: -- I thought you were going to say Casey Liss.

Rene: No, not that Casey. The other Casey, Casey Liss from The Verge put up a terrific follow-up where he said how important it was to him to have a role model like Tim Cook.

Dave: Oh yeah, I saw that.

Soroush: I thought it was really interested how it was very much divided between there are people who thinks this is super not a big deal -- whatever, Tim Cook came out; we already knew he was gay. And the people who are like prayer hands emoji, this is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and this is so inspirational. And there was such a huge division there.

Dave: I think it’s pretty easy to see why it would be a big deal for people. We want, I mean I say “we” I mean people, I hope, we want to be accepted. We want for the things that make us different to not make us so different that we’re treated as outcasts. And to have the, like -- Apple is cool. It’s not just that Apple’s a big company or a powerful company, it’s that Apple’s brand is really cool. It’s very in. It’s cool to have an iPhone. It’s cool to wear Beats headphones. It’s cool to have, you know, white earbuds in. Apple’s brand is hot. To have the guy who runs all of that be gay is way more valuable than if it were like, I don’t know, the guy running Microsoft, which is not quite as cool.

Rene: To go back to what you said a minute ago about the next great divide maybe being politics and I think Guy Neild [spelled phonetically] talked about this briefly the other day in the arts and Klein [spelled phonetically] piece in Vox about how people now define themselves by politics more than any other category. Where before, even if somebody was from your own party, you might not vote for them if they're from a different culture or a different religion. But now the politics means more to you than any other single attribute and people are divided by political lines to a far greater degree than they ever were previously.

Dave: And mark my words, we’re like eight years away from an election being you just walk in and you grab a red crayon or a blue crayon.

Guy: Yeah, you guys got to fix that.

Rene: We don’t have a two-party system in Canada. We have like eight parties and --

Dave: -- so you got a small box of crayons.

Rene: Yeah, it stops us from doing anything at all but also anything dumb as often, I think.

Dave: That's like sports. You just go in wearing your colors and everybody knows which team you’re on.

Rene: I might offend people by saying this, but when I was a kid, I thought American politics was like the Superbowl because I saw the Super Bowl on TV and I thought that you guys had two teams and every four years they would come together in this big fight and people would vote for them and one of them would win. And it really was like one versus the other.

Dave: You weren’t that far off.

Guy: And just for the record, you were growing up in South Africa, so…

Rene: Well, I left South Africa then came here.

Guy: Oh, oh, okay.

Soroush: It is very much like that, though. Right? There’s like all intermediate elections that are actually super important and just like the games in the middle are important to decide who gets to the big game, but those get sort of ignored in favor of the big hoo-rah Super Bowl.

Rene: Because in Quebec -- and Guy will laugh at this -- but in Quebec, our far extreme left party is the liberals because everyone else is on the socialist spectrum behind, like not to the left of them. And with two or three socialist parties now, it’s so much harder to have an extremist view about the politics themselves.

Dave: What is that argument? We should have free healthcare! No, you’re wrong! We should  have free healthcare and get free cars!

Rene: Yeah, see it’s very much -- yeah, it’s --

Guy: -- Well free education would be one.

Rene: Yeah. Right now we have cheap education, but free education should be…

Guy: Yeah, which I’m actually in favor of. But, whatever.

Rene: Yeah, I mean it’s an interesting debate. Some people believe that free education means that you won’t appreciate it and you’ll waste it. And some people believe that it means that it makes it more accessible to everybody.

Guy: That’s an idiotic argument. Like you won’t appreciate it? Seriously? Well…

Dave: We call that oxygen.

Guy: Yeah, it -- yeah, it’s just dumb.

Soroush: Do you guys not appreciate your free health care?

Dave: Who cares if you appreciate it. It’s not about whether or not you appreciate your education. It’s about whether or not you have it.

Guy: Well it’s like the idea is like people just skip school and like in theory it would just be a bunch of money spent that didn’t need to be spent, but --

Rene: -- Well we’d educate them all over the U.S. immediately.

Guy: -- who cares? We’d have like a super highly educated population.

Dave: I think that’s worth it.

Guy: I know, it’s like one of those -- it’s totally, and I hate this term, but it’s a classic political touchstone. Like the welfare mother, kind of thing, where you’re willfully going on welfare. In this case, it’s so stupid. Exactly. It’s like, you find one guy -- I mean, like Fox is classic for this. I think they found one surfer dude who was living on welfare and they kept beating on it for a like month.

Soroush: The very --

Guy: Sorry, my dog is going crazy.

Dave: Oh, I thought you were leaking.

Guy: No, she’s totally adorable, but she needs to go outside.

Dave: Like you’re a Guy English balloon and somebody was slowly letting air out of you.

Guy: She’s the cutest, though. She’s a -- god, she’s adorable.

Rene: So now that we’re hip deep into politics, the other thing that happened just today actually, was Barack Obama came out in favor of --
Dave: -- Oh, I thought you -- “came out...in favor of net neutrality.”

Rene: Yeah, no, totally different kind of coming out, but…

Guy: [Unintelligible] was shocked.

Rene: But this is interesting because he’s at the end of his presidency. He has no direct control over net neutrality; that’s governed by the FCC. He did a point they had at the FCC, although that head comes from the -- it was a cable industry lobbyist, so he was eminently opposed to net neutrality. And he’s just unclear why he waited so long. I mean, it sounds it’s like a great thing for him to do now, but might of been better to do then or maybe to pick people and put them in the FCC to actually get it done.

Dave: If you’re a president and you’re in second term and the midterm elections have already happened, this sounds like exactly the time you would do this sort of thing.

Guy: Yeah, he’s a lame duck. He might as well go down swinging at this point.

Dave: Right. Like everything he ever promised he was going to do, now’s the time when he’s going to try to do those things so that history remembers him as the guy who tried to do those things.

Guy: Right. It’s a hail mary. He’s got nothing to lose.

Soroush: He’s not even swinging, though. This is like not even something he has any power over.

Dave: Right, it’s about saving face because he hasn’t done anything that he promised to do.

Guy: Well…

Dave: I voted for the guy, so, blame me I guess.

Soroush: I’m with Dave.

Guy: Yeah, I don’t know. Everybody seems disaffected with him. But if you look at the numbers, he’s actually done a pretty good job. I agree that it’s pretty much ineffective. Like he can’t actually affect really any change by saying what he did. At the same time, he’s doing the most he can do, which is publicly state what he wants to have happen. I mean, that’s the limit of his powers for I think, probably good because I think if the executive branch could control the FCC, I think that would lead to like, a world of hurt.

Dave: Well the perspective that matters here -- you’ve got to understand you’re a Canadian with an education and an understanding of how the American politics works. Here in America  where we have no idea how our political process works, we all think that the president can just do anything he wants to, so --

Soroush: -- I don’t know, Dave. I’ve seen a lot of CTP grade radios [spelled phonetically].

Dave: For him to come out and say I think this should happen, most Americans and certainly on the right, want you to think this, are going to think that well, he can just do that. Like whatever he says would just be that he makes laws.

Guy: How much of a bad idea would it be if the president of the United States could control the FCC, which in turn controls the media? That is the worst idea ever. He should not be able to do that.

Dave: But that’s -- you’re thinking it through.

(Laughter)

Guy: Sorry. I’m sorry.

Dave: You can’t expect us to.

(Laughter)

Rene: Are you saying this has symbolic value, Dave?

Dave: I think that it’s really easy to snake charm the masses with this kind of thing. I think that for most people who don’t understand how the presidency works or how the FCC works or how any of these things are linked together, they're going to see Barack Obama wants net neutrality. And if you’re on the red team, you’re going to be like, “well f*** net neutrality,” and if you’re on the blue team, you’re going to be like, “yeah, net neutrality is the future.” And that’s all people are thinking right now. There’s no thoughtful discourse on what this means and what we should be doing. It’s just assumed that it’s happening now.

Guy: That’s horrible. You know what? I mean -- and again, you’re going to say that I’m making fun of America, but like evolutions falls along those lines.

Dave: Yeah.

Guy: Well not strictly and I’m sorry--

Dave: -- and neutrality is just --

Guy: -- and I’m sure there’s probably some republican voters who listen to this, but I don’t mean to -- yeah, it’s a theory -- I don’t mean to paint it with such a broad brush, but there’s cultural conservatism and for lack of a better word, you know, science.

(Laughter)

Dave: “For lack of a better word, science.”

Guy: They seem to be you know, divided along red/blue lines, which I think is pretty bananas and it’s a weird --

Rene: -- The FCC should mandate equal scientists for both sides.

Guy: That’s the worst idea ever.

Dave: It isn’t equal on both sides.

Rene: No, you should have to take scientists. Like you shouldn’t be like the ones who just -- you should have to have on your team real scientists in an equal manner.

Guy: Well, yeah, let me tell America again how to fix itself because I’m a jerk.

Dave: You should just start a show where that’s what you do.

Guy: Yeah, I know.

Rene: How to fix America, by English.

Dave: “Listen up, America,” with Guy English.

Guy: Yeah. And you know, here’s the thing, pro wrestlers versus monster trucks.

(Laughter)

Guy: Boom. Boom.

Soroush: Is that how you would decide our presidents, or…

Rene: They fought a war against the English once. They’re going to do it again.

Dave: Was that a fun?

Rene: I don’t know what that was.

Guy: So a multiple parties is probably what you guys need to be -- I mean, that’s the most basic thing.

Rene: Bring back Ross Perot.

Dave: I think the --

Guy: -- Yeah, why not? I mean hey, he funded NeXT and that’s how he got OS X in the iOS.

Dave: Unless something changes dramatically in the next two years, my vote is going to be for -- I’m just going to write in CGP Grey.

(Laughter)

Rene: So I don’t know if you saw it though, Dave, but Chris Eagler [spelled phonetically] had an interesting piece where he called out John -- you can tell I can’t pronounce his last name again -- Legere? Legere?

Dave: Legere. You asked, so that’s not a [unintelligible].

Rene: That’s so wrong that he pronounces it that way.

Guy: Is that really how he pronounces it? Really? Like -- okay. Well, he’s wrong, but okay.

Rene: So because he’s the maverick, he’s the guy who comes out and drops the f-bomb, he’s the one who’s supposed to be on the people’s side. And he was doing some really interesting tweets about net neutrality where he used the hashtag, but his tweets were kind of against it and it seems like there’s a tension between him being big carrier CEO who doesn’t want net neutrality for profit reasons and him trying to be the people’s champion who wants to be the guy that all the other carriers don’t do.

Dave: I think that he kind of -- he’s got a job to do and that job at the end of the day, he has shareholders and whatever. And I can kind of see why this might be a tough one for him. It sucks though because I like the guy and I like his maverick, “f**k everybody else“ attitude and I wish there was more of that.

Guy: I do think it’s shortsighted to suppose that you know, making a system where net neutrality is not a part of it or not ensured, that you will get more profits. I understand why because you can artificially jack up the price and like, charge for fast lanes and all that, but I don’t necessarily think that you’re locked into not being able to make big profits when you’re not a utility. Do you know what I mean? Like they don’t want to be utilities, so they want to strike down net neutrality.

Rene: Well that’s the title thing too, right, is that they’ll be reclassified as a utility and that has a whole different side of governance than what they have right now.

Guy: Yeah. They should be, because they are. I’d like to see somebody at least go with it and see what happens.

Dave: And it seems like T-Mobile, they were the first carrier, the whole un-carrier thing. They kind of understood that the whole future of their business  was just seling people dumb pipes and they needed to be the best dumb pipe company they can be. and it seems like all the moves they’ve made over the last year or whatever have been toward that goal. Like we’re going to be -- you know what, you know what sucks? Is these companies trying to give you all this crap you don’t want and charging you [unintelligible]. Here’s the deal -- we’re going to invest any of our time or energy into the crap you don’t want. Here’s an extra gig of data for the same price. Here’s unlimited calling because we’re not focused on this other sh**.

Guy: Right, that’s what I mean. I think there are approaches that could make you the best dumb pipe --

Soroush: -- Sort of the way Verizon FiOS is.

Guy: Sure. Yeah.

Soroush: I think Legere might be legitimately worried or he thinks he’s very worried that there’s just not enough bandwidth for everybody to have like a big wireless pipe straight to their phone. I don’t know if that’s the reality. There are some people that think there’s like a physical limitation there, but like I could imagine that being like what --

Dave: -- He should be smarter than that.

Soroush: -- super scared. Yeah.

Dave: If anybody should know better, it’s the guy running --

Rene: -- The guy with the pipe.

Dave: -- one of the four big carriers.

Soroush: But if you take a look at the tone of the entire statement that Obama made and compare it to the tone of the Tim Cook thing, I mean it’s night and day. The Tim Cook thing feels very honest and it feels very, like we said, he wrote it himself. But the Obama thing is almost phoney, like Obama didn’t sit down and wrote this; his speech writer wrote this.

Rene: Well he read it out loud in a video.

(Laughter)

Soroush: Well that’s good.

Dave: Well I read things out loud in videos.

Rene: I know. He totally apped [spelled phonetically] your style, Dave.

(Laughter)

Dave: Does he have cookware behind him? I haven’t see it.

Guy: Be ban [spelled phonetically]. Be ban with whiskers

Dave: I call him get-mo [spelled phonetically].

Guy: Get-mo?

Dave: [Unintelligible] joke.

Guy: Rolling with the get-mo.

Rene: So does anyone actually think that this is going to go anywhere? Or go anywhere within the next two year? Is the FCC going to have a ruling on it? They’re going to have the guts to make it a utility?

Guy: I think within --

Dave: -- Let’s elect --

Guy: -- Go ahead.

Dave: Let’s elect John Legere. Let’s see what happens. Let’s just bring him in office.

Rene: Was he born in the U.S.? Can we do that?

Dave: I don’t know. So the thing -- I guess my final thought on John Legere is he’s kind of like the pope. Where it’s not that this is the platonic ideal of the guy we want running a carrier, but  man, he’s so much better that it’s hard not to kind of celebrate some advancement. We’re not there yet, but what a great step forward.

Rene: He’s unboring. He’s not only the un-carrier, but he’s unborning.

Dave: Yeah. Here’s a carrier CEO who isn’t an obnoxious d*ck, or if he is, he’s kind of the fun kind of obnoxious d*ck. Yeah. He seem to be more on our side than he’s not. I’m pretty sure he believes in evolution.

Guy: I have a really hard time backing the idea that we should elect people for entertainment value.

Dave: Oh no, no. I didn’t mean that we should elect him for anything; I meant that we should elect him because he’s the [unintelligible]. Yeah, he’s got some ideas that are unconventional. That’s where I’m being facetious. I don’t really think we should elect him.

Guy: Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Because I mean --

Dave: Like I said, I’m voting CGP Grey.

Rene: O’Regan was an actor, right?

Guy: That’s exactly where I was going. Yeah. Twenty-five years ago the wall fail, mostly because Regan shouted at it.

Rene: Did you see that they rebuilt it with balloons over the weekend?

Guy: I know, I loved it. It looks great.

Dave: What? Really?

Rene: 99 luftballons they the --

Guy: -- Yeah, yeah. So it’s a 15 kilometer track of where the wall was -- and this is very pertinent to backter [spelled phonetically] -- but these two brothers, basically it’s an art installation and it’s like maybe every five feet there’s like a lamp post with a -- it’s a balloon or it’s a, at least a light.

Rene: Yeah.

Guy: And it’s along the entire 15 kilometer track where the wall was and it’s all lit up at night. So you can see it in an aerial shot, like exactly where the wall was in these bright, white lights and they look beautiful, too. It’s a cool -- like they should just make that installation.

Dave: Yeah, a nice little reminder of how dangerous history can be.

Guy: Well, so there thing was like -- so where the wall was, was like a dark, oppressive, depressing thing, so they thought well why not replace it with something light.

Dave: I agree. I like it in both directions. I like it the optimism of it and I like that it’s a reminder of things weren’t always this optimistic. Let’s not forget that.

Guy: Yeah, yeah.

Soroush: And the important thing is you can walk between the balloons.

(Laughter)

Guy: Oh yeah, yeah.

Rene: There’s no unarmed [unintelligible].

Dave: Well I think if they were to just remake the Berlin wall out of balloons, that still would solve the problem.

Guy: That would actually be kind of fun. Right?

Rene: But it does reinforce, like you said, Dave, that again looking 50 years out, 100 years out, do we think that we’ll be looking back and still seeing things, like a divided Korea? Still seeing things like, you know, some conflicts have been going on for thousands and thousands years and some of them have been solved in the span of a lifetime. It’s interesting exercise and scale.

Dave: You know this may sound silly, but there’s that movie, that James Franco, Seth Rogen movie coming out where they’re making fun of Kim Jong-un and apparently he’s really pissed off about this. At one point there was like a declaration of war and other sh**. What a great thing.

Rene: A movie is a declaration of war?

Dave: Yeah. Well I mean, its North Korea.

Rene: Some movie of mass destruction?

Dave: If we can keep moving North Korea in the direction of nobody in the world takes them seriously, good. If we can just make them angry and prove to the world they’re never going to do anything about it, good.

Guy: Yeah, that’s the last time the Korean war was really, really brutal.

Dave: Right, right. And this is what I’m talking about with the future-looking, optimistic, eye to the past. What can we do? What’s our next step in solving this South Korea problem? Like what needs to happen?

Guy: Given that hey have nukes and they’re insane.
(Laughs)
A movie with Seth Rogen isn’t the best way. I’m on your side; I do like it.

Dave: The only reason that we’re not just going in there and like hand waiving the problem away is because they do have weapons of mass destruction, to use the term I hate so much.

Guy: No, no, no. There’s good reasons not to, too. China would smack you down. I mean --

Dave: -- Right. There’s a handful of things. So what is our best weapon, then? Our best weapon is the court of public opinion. And so in order to start making movies where we’re just mocking their leader and like make that the -- it’s common knowledge that that guy is just an idiot. So between team America and now this thing, it seems like the problem that might be solve to some degree by comedy.

Rene: He’s going to hate our podcast now so much.

Guy: Kim Jong-un?

Dave: You know what? I’m fine with that. I’m fine with that.

Rene: No, I forget that someone said on Twitter today that comedy and entertainment and storytelling were often the best ways to instigate social change. And it’s often in the ways that are the most underestimated by those who don’t want social change.

Dave: Yeah. I like that something as dumb as a Seth Rogen movie might be another brick in the path to -- by the way, that’s a metaphor from Tim Cook -- toward fixing this f**king problem because it’s not like the rest of us are doing a whole lot about it.

Rene: Seth Rogen. Is he playing Waz [spelled phonetically]?

Guy: Eh.
Dave: He’s playing Steve Jobs now.

Rene: Well they’re going to get to him soon. I mean they’re running out of the Christian Bale’s and the Christian Slater’s.

Guy: I just don’t care. I don’t care.

Dave: You don’t care who’s playing Waz?

Guy: I mean when it’s done, I’ll watch it. Maybe.

Rene: Did you like The Social Network?

Guy: Sure. But you know, whatever. I mean, you’re adapting the Isaacson book, so…

Rene: Well I don’t know if he is. He’s doing three scenes all around -- it’s probably going to be very Aaron Sorkin where at some point, like the stage presentation -- the Mac, the iPod, iPad -- and it’ll be everything that happens around that. Sort of like the West Wing was everything around the Oval Office and Sports Night was everything around the cable broadcast.

Guy: Yeah, but he didn’t even pick the right ten poles.

Rene: Yes, I agree.

Soroush: I just want a sequel to Pirates of Silicon Valley. To have something just as good as that would be --

Dave: -- Oh, with Johnny Depp.

Rene: You got the Bill O’Reilly still, right?

Soroush: Yeah, he’s still around.

Dave: Maybe we could do a crossover event movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley and Pirates of the Caribbean.

(Laughter)

Rene: Because George is not here right now, I know we’re going to get a ton of negative reviews for all the politics we talk in this episode. So if you actually like this show, go out and give it a good review just so that we can maybe balance out all the negative ones we’re going to get.

Guy: Really? We get negative reviews about politics?

Dave: Yeah, and it’s always about the politics.

Rene: Yeah, Dave stop talking about -- you know this phenomenon happens on Twitter, too, where you’re put in a box and if you talk about anything that’s not from the box that you’re put in, people are upset with you. Stick to technology.

Guy: People would rather hear us just talk about technology in general? Or they don’t like the particular political views that we --

Dave: -- I think it’s more the latter.

Rene: Yeah, but I think our views are very humanist. Guy and I aren’t Americans. We aren’t registered republicans or democrats, we’re --

Dave: Yeah, you’re just an actor. You shouldn’t talk about politics.

Rene: Yeah. You are just --

Dave: -- Who cares what those think? Well, you know, these are people who are still a citizen, who still vote, who still have a right to thoughts and opinions about this sh**.

Guy: Alright. Okay.

Soroush: And no matter what political opinion you give, there’s going to be somebody that disagrees with it.

Dave: Well the argument is, I think, that we should just stay out of politics.

Soroush: Well certainly.

Dave: But you know, my salary isn’t paid for by the public. I owe nobody the favor of staying out of politics.

Guy: Well here’s the thing, I don’t know if you can talk about the way that technology interacts with everyday life without occasionally venturing into politics.

Dave: And net neutrality is a prime example of that.

Guy: Exactly. I think it’s all -- it ends -- Tim Cook’s message is again, intertwines with all of this stuff. So if somebody thinks that it’s a third rale, well maybe. But I don’t think you can have an honest discussion about this kind of stuff without touching in politics. And if we tend to come down on the side you don’t enjoy, I’m sorry, that’s us. But I don’t think you can discuss these kinds of topics without addressing them. And you know, the effect of social sphere and guess what, that’s what politics is. Regardless of party allegiance or anything, these are social issues and that’s what politics is about. Right?

Dave: I could see an argument -- like if your issue wasn’t that we’re talking about politics, if your issue was that we’re talking about a man that’s come out as gay, it would be easy to assume that everybody on the panel here is straight. I could see how that might be a thing worth talking about.

Rene: To bring Sorkin back into it for a second, there was a great line from the West Wing back in 1997 or something where they’re arguing about privacy and Sam Seaborn said you know, in the 30’s and 40’s it was the role of big government, in the 50’s and 60’s it wa civil rights, in the 90’s and 2000’s it’s going to be about privacy about medical records and who’s gay and who’s not and it turned out that that was prescient. That really is what everything is about now and technology is intimately woven into politics. Half the stuff that’s going on now, either the lobbying way behind technology and unable to regulate it in an effective way or trying to overregulate it, according to some. It’s going to be a recurring theme for the foreseeable future.

Guy: Yeah, well I mean I think what we call technology now is -- I mean, this show is going to be really stupid 20 years from now because we’ll be talking about --

Dave: -- You think we’re still going to be doing this in 20 years?

Rene: Do you have any plans, Dave?

Guy: Yeah. Yeah, bear with me. Bear with me.

(Laughter)

Guy: We might be.

Dave: That’s a long episode.

Guy: I’m still going to be --

(Laughter)

Guy: Call you up every week just to make sure this happens. And I will call you. They’ll be like, holographic things, but I’ll still actually just call you on the phone.

Rene: And Skype will still suck.

Dave: [Unintelligible] between Guy English shows up in my living room.
Rene: Like a sith holocron.

Guy: Right. I think what we call technology -- bear with me, this is going to be stupid -- but what we call technology now is defectively going to become everyday use, if it hasn’t already. Right?

Dave: I think it has already.

Guy: Yeah, yeah. That’s what I mean. Right.

Dave: And I think we’re far past the point.

Guy: Right. So once you hit past that tipping point, well of course this kind of stuff is going to intersect with you know, the politics and social policy and society at large, right?

Soroush: Well there’s that saying that you know, politics is the stuff that you disagree with. Everything else is, if it’s something that you already agree with, it’s just telling it like it is.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Yeah.

Rene: Yeah. I like that.

(Laughter)

Rene: That’s our episode right there.

Guy: I can’t argue with that. That’s like a totaligy. I can’t actually argue with that. Yeah, I guess I agree with it.

Dave: It’s tricky because it’s so -- it’s easy to look at our views on politics, our views on technology, through the lens of where we are right now.and I think that you’re right. If we aren’t already past , we’re coming up on the point where these things don’t quite work out. And the same way that I reject when people talk about geeky things or nerdy things. I'm as guilty of this as anybody because it’s sometimes just easier to classify and I typically only use the word “nerd” or “geek” when I’m including myself in it because it feels pejorative.

Guy: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Dave: But even then, the word kind of doesn’t make any sense to me. I was having a conversation with somebody recently where they commented on me being into nerdy things because of a video game thing I  mentioned and I’m like, what? What part of what I’m into seems nerdy? Is it the iPhone thing? Because that’s like the best selling thing ever. Is it that I like internet things? Because everyone is on the internet. Is it because I like comic book movies? Because guess what? THose are like the biggest movies right now.

Rene: Third highest grossing movie of all time.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Was it your glasses with the tape like, connected?

(Laughter)

Rene: Maybe it’s the protector.

Dave: It doesn’t mean anything anymore. What’s nerdy about any of this? Nothing. It’s all mainstream.

Guy: No, but I think that those words have lost any meaning. They’ve certainly lost their sting.

Dave: Exactly, but I think they’re still used by either people who are used to hearing it who are trying to own a word, trying to own a title, or by people who are still trying to cast it as a pejorative. And even like a subtle or playful one, it’s a weird thing. It’s hard to even break this down, but I think that people who use that word are either on the receiving end or the giving end of a pejorative whether they realize it or not.

Dave: I’ve been reminded that at some point I need to do an entire podcast as Morgan Freeman.

Rene: You did an ad read as Morgan Freeman on review.

Dave: Did I?

Rene: Yeah.

Dave:  All right.

Rene: I believe you did.

Dave: I don’t think that shipped, though. I hope that didn’t ship.

Rene: It might have shipped, I don’t know.

(Laughter)

Dave: I do know that I think it was on review last week -- the ad read. I had to listen back to it and there’s an entire chunk of stuff that I said “you’re going to have to cut this” and you said “okay” and it’s all still there.

Rene: Was it funny, though? Because if it was funny, then I didn’t need to cut it.

Dave: Well it was funny, but it was like, potentially offensive. I think it wound up being okay, but it was borderline. And I’m thinking, hmm, I’m fine -- I don’t care if I offend people, but I don’t want to do it during the sponsor read

Rene: Is that when we forgot to do Christopher Watkin during the sponsor read?

Dave: I don’t think we’ve ever done Christopher Watkin.

Rene: You keep forgetting our celebrity sponsor reads, Dave. It’s heartbreaking.

Dave: No. No, I think like, I accidentally offended Asian people or something. I don’t know. It was something like that.

Rene: Alright, well, you’ve got to pay better attention to that.

Dave: These things happen. I mean, nobody complained, so I figured it’s okay. And in fact, I even sent the audio of that read -- or no, I sent the time read to the sponsor and they said it was a great read. They really liked it.

Rene: Okay, good.

Daev: So I’m going to count it as a near miss.

Rene:Win column.

Guy: Wait, is this --

Dave: Near miss, not a win. It’s near miss.

Guy: Is this the show?

Rene: Alright, so officially starting the show.

(Laughter)

Dave: Let’s call that follow up.

Guy: No, I was actually going to ask a question.

Dave: Do it.

Guy: No, no, no, it’s medic question. I’ll wait until after the show.

Rene: Alright.

Dave: Well now everybody’s going to wonder.

Guy: Yeah, well guess what, tune into the after show that we won’t ever release, so ha ha.

Rene: So many unreleased after shows.

(Laughter)

Rene: Alright, Tim Cook did an op-ed for Business Week where -- there had been rumors that he’s been gay for years. But he came out and said it in Business Week and he did it for an incredibly good reason. He didn’t say it just, you know, just off-hand. He said it because growing up, he didn’t have role models and he wanted to make sure -- he thinks role models are a powerful thing and he wants to make sure people looking up that him being gay and a powerful CEO, he could be a role model to people. And I thought it was an excellently written editorial. I was really impressed with it.

Dave: It was vaguely “I’m not the hero you need, but hero you deserve.” It was good. It was like a -- it felt like this isn’t something he wanted to do because he wanted attention. It’s something that he wanted to do because he felt it was important because of the position he was it. Like it was a recognition of “well, I’m here, I should just tell you this thing now.” Or it seems like it’s absolutely right reason to do it.

Rene: The way he ended it was really nice. He said, “When I arrive in my office each morning, I’m greeted by framed photos of Dr. King and Robert F. Kennedy. I don’t pretend that writing this puts me in their league.  All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I’m doing my part, however small, to help others. We pave the sunlit path to justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.

Dave: Yeah. I mean, I guess it’s not my place to say right or wrong. I think any reason to tell people about yourself or to -- anytime you feel comfortable publicly disclosing things by yourself, that’s on you and there’s no right reason or wrong reason. But this is especially a right reason. It’s like his heart is not just in the right place, he’s doing this as almost a -- if not Dave00% as a service to others rather than a selfish endeavor and that makes it extra okay to me.
The scary part is he says in this, too, that by admitting this, he could be legally fired in many states of the country that he lives in.

Dave: Yeah, this seems like a -- not as an activist move, but they’re does seem to be a little bit of a hint of that.

Rene: He’s been a -- I can’t say he’s taken up -- what he and Apple have been very proactive in terms of inclusivity. They had the gay pride parade this year and they did the #ApplePride. And they’ve been supporting the civil liberties and I the, I think it’s called the Equal Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

Soroush: Yeah, it seems to fit in very much with a lot of the stuff Apple does including, like, the video about apps for blind people and other accessibility stuff they do. It’s definitely like part in parcel with that stuff, it feels.

Rene: That was in Georgia, so maybe we should introduce him, Dave.

Dave: Oh. Hey Soroush, who are you?

Soroush: I’m Soroush. Hi.

Dave: Oh. Hi.

(Laughter)

Guy: Problem solved.

Dave: What do you do over there, Soroush?

Soroush: I’m an iPhone app developer. I work for Genius, formerly known as Rap Genius.

Rene: The Genius Bar?

Soroush: The Genius Bar. I work for the Genius Bar. No, it’s an annotation platform. I make the app.
It’s a pretty cool app. You should download it.

Dave: Do you can’t help me with this broken screen issue?

Soroush: The broken screen is on you, Dave.

Dave: All right.

Rene: The annotation app, you guys annotate things. Isn’t the Tim Cook thing up on Genius?

Soroush: The Tim Cook thing is up on Genius. We have annotations on that. It sort of started from like, rap music, and now has branched off to lots of other stuff. The Tim Cook thing has a handful of annotations on it. They are pretty cool. You can also find other things, like the Obama announcement today about net neutrality; we have that up on the site with annotations of what stuff means and what people think of it, so...

Guy: So...

Dave: I like things to be annotated.

Rene:  We’ll annotate Dave after the show. This is also, I mean, I don’t know what the decision making process went into this -- it seems -- and I don’t know if you want to say anything about this, Dave

6:30

Guy: I don’t think that’s necessarily accurate.

Dave: I agree.

Rene: It was him standing up.

Guy: Yeah, it’s a bit of a different thing. I mean while it, like -- I’m looking at a quote right now in the article and it says, “While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either until now. So let me be clear, I’m proud to be gay and I consider be gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.”

Dave: That was interesting phrasing, too. We can get to that in a minute.

Guy: Yeah. I personally liked it. We may different on that. I thought it was good. So no, I don’t think this is like, Tim Cook’s coming out and he’s been in hiding all this time. No, I think people close to him probably knew and it’s not of anybody else’s business, you know. I don’t talk about my sex life in a public way and --

Dave:  -- why not?

Guy: Why not? Because it was be a long f***ing discussion, that’s why.

(Laughter)

Dave: I can teed that up for you.

Guy: But you know what I mean? It’s like, no, it’s private and it has no bearing on his job or the company or anything else. So in a lot of ways, it’s completely irrelevant. Where it is relevant is in the ways that he outlined, which is to say that, you know, he’s the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world. And to publically state that he’s gay sends a positive message to other people, despite the fact that he clearly seems to value his privacy.

Dave: He is the first -- please somebody correct me if I’m wrong -- the first Fortune 100 CEO to come out, right? It was Fortune something.

Guy: Yeah, I mean again, I don’t to -- close enough. Yes.

Dave: Close enough. Yeah, we’ll say close enough. The point being --

Guy: -- It’s very, very, very right, so I --

Dave: -- There’s a girth of strong role models in that sector for gay people of either gender, any gender.

Guy: Yes.

Dave: This kind of thing, it sets an example, it sets a bar in the same way that it echos so much of what the tech industry right is talking about with the way women in technology are being treated, where so much of it is, let’s find and elevate because we’re trying to give off the air of equality, but rather we want to set forth actual example of, like. It’s so hard to find great role models that when you can find them, let’s really cast a light on them.

Guy: Yeah, and I think that’s valuable. I mean, like I think you were just trying to say, it’s not you don’t want to put on airs or and I really dislike this word, but being diverse -- like diversity.

Dave: Right, right.

Guy: I dislike the word because talking about diversity sort of is predicated upon the notion that there is a this fixed norm. You know what I mean? Would you say --

Dave: Or at least some kind of hetero-normativity.

Guy: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You know what I mean? Like hey, let’s be diverse. There’s a gay guy. It’s like, well…

(Laughter)

Dave: Yeah he’s not the token gay CEO. He’s was a very accomplished, extremely successful and by any accounts, by anybody who’s paid any attention to Apple’s history, an incredibly effective -- like so much of Apple’s success today is ode to the work that he’s done over the last, however long he's been at Apple. He’s been a huge part of that long before the world knew about this. So theres no question, I think. There’s no sane person, nobody with any knowledge of how Apple works or what the trajectories been like since Steve came back, would look at Time and say that he hasn’t earned his place in history regardless of his sexuality.

Guy: Oh yeah, right. For sure.

Dave: And I think that’s important. This isn’t that he’s getting attention like, hey, some CEO announced that he’s gay and now he’s getting all this press to him. It worked the other direction, where sort of -- I hate to use a word like this, but it kind of legitimizes it.

Rene: He didn’t do it to get attention on himself. He did it to get attention on something that mattered to him a lot.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Yeah and --

Dave:  Really easy for detractors if it had gone the other direction. If this were a smaller company or somebody you’d never heard of, it would be really easy for detractors to say that it was just somebody looking for attention or this was a political move. Where this really feels like long before the world knew about this, so.

Guy: Yeah because I mean, for the point, this didn’t really get a lot of news coverage. I mean, it got coverage, but this -- it’s not like it did a whole news cycle and it’s like, “Wow, holy sh**, we can’t believe this.” Like, ground shaking stuff. Yeah.

(Laughter)

Guy: It was more like, “Oh yeah, okay. We got it. Moving on.”

Rene: Yeah because we all kind of looked at each other like, “Well, yeah.”

Dave: There was some --

Guy: Well yeah, I mean we all knew. I mean, well, you know, it had been talked about for a long time.

Dave: Yeah, it wasn’t a surprise.

Rene: No, I forget who said it. It was someone on Twitter and forgive me, I don’t remember who it was. But there was some backlash and  there was some push back on it and it was really all --

Guy: -- on Twitter? Someone was being a jerk on Twitter?

Rene: No, but I think they made a point was --

Guy: -- Oh, stop the presses.

Rene: A couple months ago at Apple shareholder meeting a guy stood up and he said, “Why are you wasting money on accessibility and the environment?” And Tim Cook basically said because we believe they’re incredibly important and not everything’s about the bottom line and if you don’t like it, don’t own Apple stock. And the sort of response to this was the same thing. Like there was people saying well Apple was going to lose customers because of that. They’re not going to lose a single customer that they care because of this.

Dave: Right, right. And there were people on, I guess Twitter or Facebook because I guess there was a whole thing on Facebook about boycotting Apple.

Rene: And Google too because Google had two gay guys in their last commercial and some people were outraged.

Dave: Yeah, well I mean Apple’s commercials, the whole Justin Timberlake, Jimmy Fallon thing, that’s borderline.

(Laughter)

Rene: But there are --

Dave: But that’s a guy I love. But that’s a little different.

Rene: I think it’s fair to say those people are on the wrong side of history and looking back 50 years from 100 years, we’re going to be appalled at the way we treated humans the same way we’re appalled at how we treated them 100 years ago.

Dave: In St. Petersburg, they took down the Steve Jobs memorial because they were convinced that Apple was helping this spread gay propaganda.

Rene: Did they give back their Macbooks and iPhones?

Guy: I don’t know.

Rene: It seems like a very jerky public thing to do.

Guy: As a very small Apple shareholder, I would totally support them just pulling out of Russia. Really. F*** those guys.

Dave: The entire nation?

Guy: Well, I don’t mean the individual people, but I mean come on. If you’re going to --

Dave: -- Oh I agree with you. This is a -- whenever you go on your rants about the things America needs to do, I got ot roll my eyes a little bit. But I’d stand behind you on this one. Like come on Russia, get your shit together.

Guy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I do -- yeah, I mean, those are answered mostly in good fun. It’s like needling your brother, right? At that point.

(Laughter)

Dave: But yeah, the whole Russia thing, it drives me nuts because we look at that country like, when me as an American, I look at an entire nation I’m like [sucks teeth] too intolerant.

(Laughter)

Soroush: And didn’t Tim Cook to go Russian and meet Putin or didn’t Putin come to Silicon Valley a little while ago?

Dave: Oh man, can you imagine Tim Cook lands in Moscow and is immediately arrested for being gay.

(Laughter)

Rene: Yeah well that’s, I think, that sort of thing when you put them in those situations, it does highlight just how absurd some of the stuff is.

Guy: Well I mean up until, when was it -- a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago -- Tim Cook was the CEO of Apple to like arguably one of the most powerful companies in and he was not legally allowed to be married in his home state.

Rene: Yeah.

Guy: Which is mind boggling when you think about it.

Dave: I think this is the obvious comparison and the comparison people tend to make is the civil rights movement. I think that the civil rights movement happened at a time when that was still a new enough idea that you could kind of see why people had a hard time with the change. Like I’m not saying that they’re right. I’m not trying advocate for that position, but you could understand why at that point in history, people might see it the other way. Now this doesn’t feel like the civil rights movement because we f***ing know better. This is not a legitimate, reasonable position to be taking anywhere in the world in the year 2014.

Soroush: Right. We’ve been through the abolitionist movement, we’ve been through the suffrage movement, we’ve been through the civil rights movement, and it’s like, how many times do we have to do this?

Rene: How many times can we get this wrong?

Dave: Yeah, you’re not just on the wrong side of history, you’re so clearly on the wrong side of logic that it’s ah, there’s just no f***ing help for you people.

Guy: I wonder what the next thing's going to be. Like what are we --

Dave: -- AI rights?

Guy: AI rights maybe. I mean yeah, like --

Dave: Well I was going to go one step further because right now we’re talking just gay, but like transgendered and all these other things -- that’s going to be, I think, the next phase of this part of it. But like, what is the next thing?

Rene: Animal rights? Robotic rights?

Guy: Well I’m trying to think like, what would be offended as when we’re like 20, 30 years from now.

Dave: Android users.

(Laughter)

Rene: We love our Android users.

Guy: Those guys need to go into a gulag.

Dave: They can already vote. I don’t know what else they’re going to get.

(Laughter)

Rene: We’re getting to a point where, I mean, our tolerance level -- like there are some religions in which murder is okay and you know, we still don’t like those. So it’s not that we’re saying everything is fine, everything is dandy. We’re saying that you know, there's certain things we believe is human that transcend any particular background, culture, belief system, etcetera and we’re trying to get those things right.

Guy: Right.

Dave: I think if I’m going to off the cuff, straight out of my ass, bullsh** an answer to that question, I think maybe it’s politics. Maybe your political affiliation. We start self-selecting these things and it becomes we’ve run out of things to hate each other for. Like it’s no longer okay to hate each other for -- no longer considered reasonable to hate each other for things we can’t control, now we just focus on hating each other for things can’t control.

Rene: Terrible example of this, when I grew up, two of my best friends were Jamaican and their families would talk Jamaican politics a lot. And one of the things they told me because we were going to through the whole language debate in Quebec at the time, was that here we are, we come from an island that has terrific weather, most of us are the same cultural background, we all speak the same language, we all have the same religions, we kill over politics. I was like, humans have to find a way to be divided against each other.

Dave: We need an “us” and we need a “them”.

Rene: Well if Georgia was here, she could explain tribalism to us again.

Dave: Where is Georgia?

Rene: Secret assignment.

Dave: Oh.

Soroush: It doesn’t feel like this is about tribalism, though. You know, we’ve talked about sort of diversity or like falling on the right side of history and I think Tim Cook puts it pretty plainly. He just wants this to be for the people who don’t have someone to look up to.

Guy: Right.

Soroush: I don’t think there’s much else that you can pull from this specifically.

Dave: Oh, no we’re sort of like talking broadly about the issue.

Soroush: Certainly.

Rene: To that point though, Casey Newton on The Verge --

Dave: -- I thought you were going to say Casey Liss.

Rene: No, not that Casey. The other Casey, Casey Liss from The Verge put up a terrific follow-up where he said how important it was to him to have a role model like Tim Cook.

Dave: Oh yeah, I saw that.

Soroush: I thought it was really interested how it was very much divided between there are people who thinks this is super not a big deal -- whatever, Tim Cook came out; we already knew he was gay. And the people who are like prayer hands emoji, this is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and this is so inspirational. And there was such a huge division there.

Dave: I think it’s pretty easy to see why it would be a big deal for people. We want, I mean I say “we” I mean people, I hope, we want to be accepted. We want for the things that make us different to not make us so different that we’re treated as outcasts. And to have the, like -- Apple is cool. It’s not just that Apple’s a big company or a powerful company, it’s that Apple’s brand is really cool. It’s very in. It’s cool to have an iPhone. It’s cool to wear Beats headphones. It’s cool to have, you know, white earbuds in. Apple’s brand is hot. To have the guy who runs all of that be gay is way more valuable than if it were like, I don’t know, the guy running Microsoft, which is not quite as cool.

Rene: To go back to what you said a minute ago about the next great divide maybe being politics and I think Guy and Italked about this briefly the other day in the Erza Klein piece in Vox about how people now define themselves by politics more than any other category. Where before, even if somebody was from your own party, you might not vote for them if they're from a different culture or a different religion. But now the politics means more to you than any other single attribute and people are divided by political lines to a far greater degree than they ever were previously.

Dave: And mark my words, we’re like eight years away from an election being you just walk in and you grab a red crayon or a blue crayon.

Guy: Yeah, you guys got to fix that.

Rene: We don’t have a two-party system in Canada. We have like eight parties and --

Dave: -- so you got a small box of crayons.

Rene: Yeah, it stops us from doing anything at all but also anything dumb as often, I think.

Dave: That's like sports. You just go in wearing your colors and everybody knows which team you’re on.

Rene: I might offend people by saying this, but when I was a kid, I thought American politics was like the Superbowl because I saw the Super Bowl on TV and I thought that you guys had two teams and every four years they would come together in this big fight and people would vote for them and one of them would win. And it really was like one versus the other.

Dave: You weren’t that far off.

Guy: And just for the record, you were growing up in South Africa, so…

(Laughter)

Rene: Well, I left South Africa then came here.

Guy: Oh, oh, okay.

Soroush: It is very much like that, though. Right? There’s like all intermediate elections that are actually super important and just like the games in the middle are important to decide who gets to the big game, but those get sort of ignored in favor of the big hoo-rah Super Bowl.

Rene: Because in Quebec -- and Guy will laugh at this -- but in Quebec, our far extreme left party is the Liberals because everyone else is on the socialist spectrum behind, like not to the left of them. And with two or three socialist parties now, it’s so much harder to have an extremist view about the politics themselves.

Dave: What is that argument? We should have free healthcare! No, you’re wrong! We should  have free healthcare and get free cars!

Rene: Yeah, see it’s very much -- yeah, it’s --

Guy: -- Well free education would be one.

Rene: Yeah. Right now we have cheap education, but free education should be…

Guy: Yeah, which I’m actually in favor of. But, whatever.

Rene: Yeah, I mean it’s an interesting debate. Some people believe that free education means that you won’t appreciate it and you’ll waste it. And some people believe that it means that it makes it more accessible to everybody.

Guy: That’s an idiotic argument. Like you won’t appreciate it? Seriously? Well…

Dave: We call that oxygen.

Guy: Yeah, it -- yeah, it’s just dumb.

Soroush: Do you guys not appreciate your free health care?

Dave: Who cares if you appreciate it. It’s not about whether or not you appreciate your education. It’s about whether or not you have it.

Guy: Well it’s like the idea is like people just skip school and like in theory it would just be a bunch of money spent that didn’t need to be spent, but --

Rene: -- Well we’d educate them all over the U.S. immediately.

Guy: -- who cares? We’d have like a super highly educated population.

Dave: I think that’s worth it.

Guy: I know, it’s like one of those -- it’s totally, and I hate this term, but it’s a classic political touchstone. Like the welfare mother, kind of thing, where you’re willfully going on welfare. In this case, it’s so stupid. Exactly. It’s like, you find one guy -- I mean, like Fox is classic for this. I think they found one surfer dude who was living on welfare and they kept beating on it for a like month.

Soroush: The very --

Guy: Sorry, my dog is going crazy.

Dave: Oh, I thought you were leaking.

(Laughter)

Guy: No, she’s totally adorable, but she needs to go outside.

Dave: Like you’re a Guy English balloon and somebody was slowly letting air out of you.

Guy: She’s the cutest, though. She’s a -- god, she’s adorable.

Rene: So now that we’re hip deep into politics, the other thing that happened just today actually, was Barack Obama came out in favor of --

(Laughs)
Dave: -- Oh, I thought you -- “came out...in favor of net neutrality.”

Rene: Yeah, no, totally different kind of coming out, but…

Guy: [Unintelligible] was shocked.

(Laughter)

Rene: But this is interesting because he’s at the end of his presidency. He has no direct control over net neutrality; that’s governed by the FCC. He did a point they had at the FCC, although that head comes from the -- it was a cable industry lobbyist, so he was eminently opposed to net neutrality. And he’s just unclear why he waited so long. I mean, it sounds it’s like a great thing for him to do now, but might of been better to do then or maybe to pick people and put them in the FCC to actually get it done.

Dave: If you’re a president and you’re in second term and the midterm elections have already happened, this sounds like exactly the time you would do this sort of thing.

Guy: Yeah, he’s a lame duck. He might as well go down swinging at this point.

Dave: Right. Like everything he ever promised he was going to do, now’s the time when he’s going to try to do those things so that history remembers him as the guy who tried to do those things.

Guy: Right. It’s a hail mary. He’s got nothing to lose.

Soroush: He’s not even swinging, though. This is like not even something he has any power over.

Dave: Right, it’s about saving face because he hasn’t done anything that he promised to do.

Guy: Well…

Dave: I voted for the guy, so, blame me I guess.

Soroush: I’m with Dave.

Guy: Yeah, I don’t know. Everybody seems disaffected with him. But if you look at the numbers, he’s actually done a pretty good job. I agree that it’s pretty much ineffective. Like he can’t actually affect really any change by saying what he did. At the same time, he’s doing the most he can do, which is publicly state what he wants to have happen. I mean, that’s the limit of his powers for I think, probably good because I think if the executive branch could control the FCC, I think that would lead to like, a world of hurt.

Dave: Well the perspective that matters here -- you’ve got to understand you’re a Canadian with an education and an understanding of how the American politics works. Here in America  where we have no idea how our political process works, we all think that the president can just do anything he wants to, so --

Soroush: -- I don’t know, Dave. I’ve seen a lot of CGP Grey videos.

Dave: For him to come out and say I think this should happen, most Americans and certainly on the right, want you to think this, are going to think that well, he can just do that. Like whatever he says would just be that he makes laws.

Guy: How much of a bad idea would it be if the president of the United States could control the FCC, which in turn controls the media? That is the worst idea ever. He should not be able to do that.

Dave: But that’s -- you’re thinking it through.

(Laughter)

Guy: Sorry. I’m sorry.

Dave: You can’t expect us to.

(Laughter)

Rene: Are you saying this has symbolic value, Dave?

Dave: I think that it’s really easy to snake charm the masses with this kind of thing. I think that for most people who don’t understand how the presidency works or how the FCC works or how any of these things are linked together, they're going to see Barack Obama wants net neutrality. And if you’re on the red team, you’re going to be like, “well f*** net neutrality,” and if you’re on the blue team, you’re going to be like, “yeah, net neutrality is the future.” And that’s all people are thinking right now. There’s no thoughtful discourse on what this means and what we should be doing. It’s just assumed that it’s happening now.

Guy: That’s horrible. You know what? I mean -- and again, you’re going to say that I’m making fun of America, but like evolutions falls along those lines.

Dave: Yeah.

Guy: Well not strictly and I’m sorry--

Dave: -- and neutrality is just --

Guy: -- and I’m sure there’s probably some republican voters who listen to this, but I don’t mean to -- yeah, it’s a theory -- I don’t mean to paint it with such a broad brush, but there’s cultural conservatism and for lack of a better word, you know, science.

(Laughter)

Dave: “For lack of a better word, science.”

Guy: They seem to be you know, divided along red/blue lines, which I think is pretty bananas and it’s a weird --

Rene: -- The FCC should mandate equal scientists for both sides.

Guy: That’s the worst idea ever.

Dave: It isn’t equal on both sides.

Rene: No, you should have to take scientists. Like you shouldn’t be like the ones who just -- you should have to have on your team real scientists in an equal manner.

Guy: Well, yeah, let me tell America again how to fix itself because I’m a jerk.

Dave: You should just start a show where that’s what you do.

Guy: Yeah, I know.

Rene: How to fix America, by English.

Dave: “Listen up, America,” with Guy English.

Guy: Yeah. And you know, here’s the thing, pro wrestlers versus monster trucks.

(Laughter)

Guy: Boom. Boom.

Soroush: Is that how you would decide our presidents, or…

Rene: They fought a war against the English once. They’re going to do it again.

Dave: Was that a fun?

Rene: I don’t know what that was.

Guy: So a multiple parties is probably what you guys need to be -- I mean, that’s the most basic thing.

Rene: Bring back Ross Perot.

Dave: I think the --

Guy: -- Yeah, why not? I mean hey, he funded NeXT and that’s how he got OS X and iOS.

Dave: Unless something changes dramatically in the next two years, my vote is going to be for -- I’m just going to write in CGP Grey.

(Laughter)

Rene: So I don’t know if you saw it though, Dave, but Chris Ziegler on the Verge had an interesting piece where he called out John -- you can tell I can’t pronounce his last name again -- Legere? Legere?

Dave: Legere. You asked, so that’s not a drink.

Rene: That’s so wrong that he pronounces it that way.

Guy: Is that really how he pronounces it? Really? Like -- okay. Well, he’s wrong, but okay.

Rene: So because he’s the maverick, he’s the guy who comes out and drops the f-bomb, he’s the one who’s supposed to be on the people’s side. And he was doing some really interesting tweets about net neutrality where he used the hashtag, but his tweets were kind of against it and it seems like there’s a tension between him being big carrier CEO who doesn’t want net neutrality for profit reasons and him trying to be the people’s champion who wants to be the guy that all the other carriers don’t do.

Dave: I think that he kind of -- he’s got a job to do and that job at the end of the day, he has shareholders and whatever. And I can kind of see why this might be a tough one for him. It sucks though because I like the guy and I like his maverick, “f**k everybody else“ attitude and I wish there was more of that.

Guy: I do think it’s shortsighted to suppose that you know, making a system where net neutrality is not a part of it or not ensured, that you will get more profits. I understand why because you can artificially jack up the price and like, charge for fast lanes and all that, but I don’t necessarily think that you’re locked into not being able to make big profits when you’re not a utility. Do you know what I mean? Like they don’t want to be utilities, so they want to strike down net neutrality.

Rene: Well that’s the title thing too, right, is that they’ll be reclassified as a utility and that has a whole different side of governance than what they have right now.

Guy: Yeah. They should be, because they are. I’d like to see somebody at least go with it and see what happens.

Dave: And it seems like T-Mobile, they were the first carrier, the whole un-carrier thing. They kind of understood that the whole future of their business  was just seling people dumb pipes and they needed to be the best dumb pipe company they can be. and it seems like all the moves they’ve made over the last year or whatever have been toward that goal. Like we’re going to be -- you know what, you know what sucks? Is these companies trying to give you all this crap you don’t want and charging you [unintelligible]. Here’s the deal -- we’re going to invest any of our time or energy into the crap you don’t want. Here’s an extra gig of data for the same price. Here’s unlimited calling because we’re not focused on this other sh**.

Guy: Right, that’s what I mean. I think there are approaches that could make you the best dumb pipe --

Soroush: -- Sort of the way Verizon FiOS is.

Guy: Sure. Yeah.

Soroush: I think Legere might be legitimately worried or he thinks he’s very worried that there’s just not enough bandwidth for everybody to have like a big wireless pipe straight to their phone. I don’t know if that’s the reality. There are some people that think there’s like a physical limitation there, but like I could imagine that being like what --

Dave: -- He should be smarter than that.

Soroush: -- super scared. Yeah.

Dave: If anybody should know better, it’s the guy running --

Rene: -- The guy with the pipe.

Dave: -- one of the four big carriers.

Soroush: But if you take a look at the tone of the entire statement that Obama made and compare it to the tone of the Tim Cook thing, I mean it’s night and day. The Tim Cook thing feels very honest and it feels very, like we said, he wrote it himself. But the Obama thing is almost phoney, like Obama didn’t sit down and wrote this; his speech writer wrote this.

Rene: Well he read it out loud in a video.

(Laughter)

Soroush: Well that’s good.

Dave: Well I read things out loud in videos.

Rene: I know. He totally aped your style, Dave.

(Laughter)

Dave: Does he have cookware behind him? I haven’t see it.

Guy: Be ban. Be ban with whiskers

Dave: I call him Gitmo.

Guy: Gitmo?

Dave: [Unintelligible] joke.

Guy: Rolling with the Gitmo.

Rene: So does anyone actually think that this is going to go anywhere? Or go anywhere within the next two year? Is the FCC going to have a ruling on it? They’re going to have the guts to make it a utility?

Guy: I think within --

Dave: -- Let’s elect --

Guy: -- Go ahead.

Dave: Let’s elect John Legere. Let’s see what happens. Let’s just bring him in office.

Rene: Was he born in the U.S.? Can we do that?

Dave: I don’t know. So the thing -- I guess my final thought on John Legere is he’s kind of like the pope. Where it’s not that this is the platonic ideal of the guy we want running a carrier, but  man, he’s so much better that it’s hard not to kind of celebrate some advancement. We’re not there yet, but what a great step forward.

Rene: He’s unboring. He’s not only the un-carrier, but he’s unboring.

Dave: Yeah. Here’s a carrier CEO who isn’t an obnoxious d*ck, or if he is, he’s kind of the fun kind of obnoxious d*ck. Yeah. He seem to be more on our side than he’s not. I’m pretty sure he believes in evolution.

Guy: I have a really hard time backing the idea that we should elect people for entertainment value.

Dave: Oh no, no. I didn’t mean that we should elect him for anything; I meant that we should elect him because he’s the [unintelligible]. Yeah, he’s got some ideas that are unconventional. That’s where I’m being facetious. I don’t really think we should elect him.

Guy: Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Because I mean --

Dave: Like I said, I’m voting CGP Grey.

Rene: Reagan was an actor, right?

Guy: That’s exactly where I was going. Yeah. Twenty-five years ago the wall fail, mostly because Reagan shouted at it.

Rene: Did you see that they rebuilt it with balloons over the weekend?

Guy: I know, I loved it. It looks great.

Dave: What? Really?

Rene: 99 Luftballons --

Guy: -- Yeah, yeah. So it’s a 15 kilometer track of where the wall was -- and this is very pertinent to Vector -- but these two brothers, basically it’s an art installation and it’s like maybe every five feet there’s like a lamp post with a -- it’s a balloon or it’s a, at least a light.

Rene: Yeah.

Guy: And it’s along the entire 15 kilometer track where the wall was and it’s all lit up at night. So you can see it in an aerial shot, like exactly where the wall was in these bright, white lights and they look beautiful, too. It’s a cool -- like they should just make that installation.

Dave: Yeah, a nice little reminder of how dangerous history can be.

Guy: Well, so there thing was like -- so where the wall was, was like a dark, oppressive, depressing thing, so they thought well why not replace it with something light.

Dave: I agree. I like it in both directions. I like it the optimism of it and I like that it’s a reminder of things weren’t always this optimistic. Let’s not forget that.

Guy: Yeah, yeah.

Soroush: And the important thing is you can walk between the balloons.

(Laughter)

Guy: Oh yeah, yeah.

Rene: There’s no unarmed [unintelligible].

Dave: Well I think if they were to just remake the Berlin wall out of balloons, that still would solve the problem.

Guy: That would actually be kind of fun. Right?

Rene: But it does reinforce, like you said, Dave, that again looking 50 years out, 100 years out, do we think that we’ll be looking back and still seeing things, like a divided Korea? Still seeing things like, you know, some conflicts have been going on for thousands and thousands years and some of them have been solved in the span of a lifetime. It’s interesting exercise and scale.

Dave: You know this may sound silly, but there’s that movie, that James Franco, Seth Rogen movie coming out where they’re making fun of Kim Jong-un and apparently he’s really pissed off about this. At one point there was like a declaration of war and other sh**. What a great thing.

Rene: A movie is a declaration of war?

Dave: Yeah. Well I mean, its North Korea.

Rene: Some movie of mass destruction?

Dave: If we can keep moving North Korea in the direction of nobody in the world takes them seriously, good. If we can just make them angry and prove to the world they’re never going to do anything about it, good.

Guy: Yeah, that’s the last time the Korean war was really, really brutal.

Dave: Right, right. And this is what I’m talking about with the future-looking, optimistic, eye to the past. What can we do? What’s our next step in solving this South Korea problem? Like what needs to happen?

Guy: Given that hey have nukes and they’re insane.
(Laughs)
A movie with Seth Rogen isn’t the best way. I’m on your side; I do like it.

Dave: The only reason that we’re not just going in there and like hand waiving the problem away is because they do have weapons of mass destruction, to use the term I hate so much.

Guy: No, no, no. There’s good reasons not to, too. China would smack you down. I mean --

Dave: -- Right. There’s a handful of things. So what is our best weapon, then? Our best weapon is the court of public opinion. And so in order to start making movies where we’re just mocking their leader and like make that the -- it’s common knowledge that that guy is just an idiot. So between team America and now this thing, it seems like the problem that might be solve to some degree by comedy.

Rene: He’s going to hate our podcast now so much.

Guy: Kim Jong-un?

Dave: You know what? I’m fine with that. I’m fine with that.

Rene: No, I forget that someone said on Twitter today that comedy and entertainment and storytelling were often the best ways to instigate social change. And it’s often in the ways that are the most underestimated by those who don’t want social change.

Dave: Yeah. I like that something as dumb as a Seth Rogen movie might be another brick in the path to -- by the way, that’s a metaphor from Tim Cook -- toward fixing this f**king problem because it’s not like the rest of us are doing a whole lot about it.

Rene: Seth Rogen. Is he playing Woz?

Guy: Eh.

Dave: He’s playing Steve Jobs now.

Rene: Well they’re going to get to him soon. I mean they’re running out of the Christian Bale’s and the Christian Slater’s.

Guy: I just don’t care. I don’t care.

Dave: You don’t care who’s playing Woz?

Guy: I mean when it’s done, I’ll watch it. Maybe.

Rene: Did you like The Social Network?

Guy: Sure. But you know, whatever. I mean, you’re adapting the Isaacson book, so…

Rene: Well I don’t know if he is. He’s doing three scenes all around -- it’s probably going to be very Aaron Sorkin where at some point, like the stage presentation -- the Mac, the iPod, iPad -- and it’ll be everything that happens around that. Sort of like the West Wing was everything around the Oval Office and Sports Night was everything around the cable broadcast.

Guy: Yeah, but he didn’t even pick the right tent poles.

Rene: Yes, I agree.

Soroush: I just want a sequel to Pirates of Silicon Valley. To have something just as good as that would be --

Dave: -- Oh, with Johnny Depp.

Rene: You got the Bill O’Reilly still, right?

Soroush: Yeah, he’s still around.

Dave: Maybe we could do a crossover event movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley and Pirates of the Caribbean.

(Laughter)

Rene: Because George is not here right now, I know we’re going to get a ton of negative reviews for all the politics we talk in this episode. So if you actually like this show, go out and give it a good review just so that we can maybe balance out all the negative ones we’re going to get.

Guy: Really? We get negative reviews about politics?

Dave: Yeah, and it’s always about the politics.

Rene: Yeah, Dave stop talking about -- you know this phenomenon happens on Twitter, too, where you’re put in a box and if you talk about anything that’s not from the box that you’re put in, people are upset with you. Stick to technology.

Guy: People would rather hear us just talk about technology in general? Or they don’t like the particular political views that we --

Dave: -- I think it’s more the latter.

Rene: Yeah, but I think our views are very humanist. Guy and I aren’t Americans. We aren’t registered republicans or democrats, we’re --

Dave: Yeah, you’re just an actor. You shouldn’t talk about politics.

Rene: Yeah. You are just --

Dave: -- Who cares what those think? Well, you know, these are people who are still a citizen, who still vote, who still have a right to thoughts and opinions about this sh**.

Guy: Alright. Okay.

Soroush: And no matter what political opinion you give, there’s going to be somebody that disagrees with it.

Dave: Well the argument is, I think, that we should just stay out of politics.

Soroush: Well certainly.

Dave: But you know, my salary isn’t paid for by the public. I owe nobody the favor of staying out of politics.

Guy: Well here’s the thing, I don’t know if you can talk about the way that technology interacts with everyday life without occasionally venturing into politics.

Dave: And net neutrality is a prime example of that.

Guy: Exactly. I think it’s all -- it ends -- Tim Cook’s message is again, intertwines with all of this stuff. So if somebody thinks that it’s a third rale, well maybe. But I don’t think you can have an honest discussion about this kind of stuff without touching in politics. And if we tend to come down on the side you don’t enjoy, I’m sorry, that’s us. But I don’t think you can discuss these kinds of topics without addressing them. And you know, the effect of social sphere and guess what, that’s what politics is. Regardless of party allegiance or anything, these are social issues and that’s what politics is about. Right?

Dave: I could see an argument -- like if your issue wasn’t that we’re talking about politics, if your issue was that we’re talking about a man that’s come out as gay, it would be easy to assume that everybody on the panel here is straight. I could see how that might be a thing worth talking about.

Rene: To bring Sorkin back into it for a second, there was a great line from the West Wing back in 1997 or something where they’re arguing about privacy and Sam Seaborn said you know, in the 30’s and 40’s it was the role of big government, in the 50’s and 60’s it wa civil rights, in the 90’s and 2000’s it’s going to be about privacy about medical records and who’s gay and who’s not and it turned out that that was prescient. That really is what everything is about now and technology is intimately woven into politics. Half the stuff that’s going on now, either the lobbying way behind technology and unable to regulate it in an effective way or trying to overregulate it, according to some. It’s going to be a recurring theme for the foreseeable future.

Guy: Yeah, well I mean I think what we call technology now is -- I mean, this show is going to be really stupid 20 years from now because we’ll be talking about --

Dave: -- You think we’re still going to be doing this in 20 years?

Rene: Do you have any plans, Dave?

Guy: Yeah. Yeah, bear with me. Bear with me.

(Laughter)

Guy: We might be.

Dave: That’s a long episode.

Guy: I’m still going to be --

(Laughter)

Guy: Call you up every week just to make sure this happens. And I will call you. They’ll be like, holographic things, but I’ll still actually just call you on the phone.

Rene: And Skype will still suck.

Dave: [Unintelligible] between Guy English shows up in my living room.
Rene: Like a sith holocron.

Guy: Right. I think what we call technology -- bear with me, this is going to be stupid -- but what we call technology now is defectively going to become everyday use, if it hasn’t already. Right?

Dave: I think it has already.

Guy: Yeah, yeah. That’s what I mean. Right.

Dave: And I think we’re far past the point.

Guy: Right. So once you hit past that tipping point, well of course this kind of stuff is going to intersect with you know, the politics and social policy and society at large, right?

Soroush: Well there’s that saying that you know, politics is the stuff that you disagree with. If it’s something that you already agree with, it’s just telling it like it is.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Yeah.

Rene: Yeah. I like that.

(Laughter)

Rene: That’s our episode right there.

Guy: I can’t argue with that. That’s like a tautology. I can’t actually argue with that. Yeah, I guess I agree with it.

Dave: It’s tricky because it’s so -- it’s easy to look at our views on politics, our views on technology, through the lens of where we are right now.and I think that you’re right. If we aren’t already past , we’re coming up on the point where these things don’t quite work out. And the same way that I reject when people talk about geeky things or nerdy things. I'm as guilty of this as anybody because it’s sometimes just easier to classify and I typically only use the word “nerd” or “geek” when I’m including myself in it because it feels pejorative.

Guy: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Dave: But even then, the word kind of doesn’t make any sense to me. I was having a conversation with somebody recently where they commented on me being into nerdy things because of a video game thing I  mentioned and I’m like, what? What part of what I’m into seems nerdy? Is it the iPhone thing? Because that’s like the best selling thing ever. Is it that I like internet things? Because everyone is on the internet. Is it because I like comic book movies? Because guess what? THose are like the biggest movies right now.

Rene: Third highest grossing movie of all time.

Dave: Right.

Guy: Was it your glasses with the tape like, connected?

(Laughter)

Rene: Maybe it’s the protector.

Dave: It doesn’t mean anything anymore. What’s nerdy about any of this? Nothing. It’s all mainstream.

Guy: No, but I think that those words have lost any meaning. They’ve certainly lost their sting.

Dave: Exactly, but I think they’re still used by either people who are used to hearing it who are trying to own a word, trying to own a title, or by people who are still trying to cast it as a pejorative. And even like a subtle or playful one, it’s a weird thing. It’s hard to even break this down, but I think that people who use that word are either on the receiving end or the giving end of a pejorative whether they realize it or not.Embed
