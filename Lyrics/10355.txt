Fragile Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just watching the clock count down
Yeah, just a couple seconds and it all comes out
And why would she hold back now?
Been doing it all her life
Ain't wasting no more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't keep it all inside
Couldn't even if she tried
Told 'em all to run and hide
'Cause it's all coming out tonight
Who needs inhibitions like
Oh, suddenly she wasn't scared at all
In the comfort of the chaos and the calm
When she realized she was fragile like a bomb, like a bomb
Oh, growing like a flower through a wall
And drawing all the power from the flaws
But she's nothing like the flower, not at all, not at all
[Chorus]
Oh woah, it's a beautiful, wild kind of power
Oh woah, let it out, let it out, let it out
Oh woah, oh, it's a beautiful, wild kind of power
Oh woah, oh, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out

[Drop]
It's a beautiful, wild kind of power
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
Oh woah, let it out, let it out, let it out

[Verse 2]
She'll dare ya to do something
Waiting for the moment she can pull the pin
She's had enough of it
Been doing it all her life
Ain't wasting no more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't keep it all inside
Couldn't even if she tried
Told 'em all to run and hide (Ooh)
'Cause it's all coming out tonight

[Chorus]
Oh woah, it's a beautiful wild kind of power
Oh woah, oh, let it out, let it out, let it out
Oh woah
Let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out

Let it out, let it out, let it out
Let it out

[Outro]
Hold your breath, start counting backwards
We're all fighting quiet battles
There is so much strength in all your fragile, yeah
Hold your breath, start counting backwards
We're all fighting quiet battles
There is so much strength in all your fragile, yeah1Embed
