The Shift Lyrics[Vers e1]
I didn't feel the change but don't feel the same, I never knew a shift was happening
The scenery just seemed to be stuck on, stuck on, stuck on repeat
All of my memories are just a colorful blur
Feels like I'm falling, falling, falling in reverse

[Chorus]
In the art of war (in the art of war)
What are we fighting for (fighting for)?
We go from silence to sirens without a space between
We are a violent virus without a remedy
[Verse 2]
In a wild lust, we've opened up a whole new world set to self-destruct
My innocence just seemed to be slipping, slipping, slipping away
All that we've managed to make is just a comfortable cage
Oh god, I got to get out, get out, get out of this place

[Chorus]
In the art of war (in the art of war)
What are we fighting for?
We go from silence to sirens without a space between
We are a violent virus without a remedy

[Bridge]
Art, war, what are we fighting for?
Art, war, what are we dying for?
Art, war, what are we fighting for?
Art, war, what are we dying for?

[Outro]
We go from silence to sirens without a space between
(without a space between)
We are a violent virus without a remedy
(without a remedy)
We are a violent virus without a remedyYou might also like1Embed
