First thing to go was the sound of his voice, ah
It echoes still, I'm sure, but I can't hear it
Was it gentle or cold? Or maybe just noise, I
Heard what I wanted until I couldn't

[Chorus]
And I'm scared to lose, ah
What's left of you

[Verse 2]
Time moves slow, I just talk to myself
I finish my own sentences the way you used to
Why do memories glow the way real moments don't? Ah
My altar is full of our love's delusions
[Chorus]
And I, mmm
And I, mmm
And I'm scared to lose
What's left of you
And I should forget
But I love what's left

[Outro]
