I can’t fight this feeling that won’t go away
Into deep to think of looking back, yeah
You go stealing hearts and then you runaway
And I keep holding on to what we had

[Pre-Chorus: Kendall & James]
When it comes to you girl
I’m prepared to do anything that it takes
I’m falling down, fall on me
Zero games, baby please
Please, please, yeah!
[Chorus: All]
'Cause I'm never giving you up, not giving you up
Not giving you up, not giving you up
Not giving you up, not giving you up, no
'Cause I'm never giving you up, not giving you up
Not giving you up, not giving you up
Not giving you up, not giving you up, no
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Carlos & Logan]
Some cardio and mimosas in the morning
I just can’t get enough of you (ooh)
Just name it girl you know that I’d be on it
I just can’t say no to you

[Pre-Chorus: Kendall & James]
When it comes to you girl
I’m prepared to do anything that it takes
I’m falling down, fall on me
Zero games, baby please
