Sweet Child O’ Mine (Live In Las Vegas, Thomas & Mack Center - January 25, 1992) Lyrics[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
[Chorus]
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds mе of a warm, safe place
Wherе as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

[Chorus]
Woah, woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Woah, yeah
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-woah-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, oh, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
