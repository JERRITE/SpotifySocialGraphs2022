Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me

[Verse 1: Luke]
Never a night alone, anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the mornin' wearin' someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone with people I don't know
Woke up in the mornin', how the hell'd I make it home?
[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Chorus: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me

[Verse 2: Luke]
Another round, here we go, goin' in blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Bridge: Luke]
Devil at my door
Got me knockin', knockin', knockin' on the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walkin', walkin', walkin' outta here alive

[Chorus: Luke, Luke & Calum]
