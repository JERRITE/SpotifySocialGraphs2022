TranslationsEspañol​pg baby (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: redveil with Denzel Curry]
You can go your own way, or leave me
You can go your own way, or leave me, baby
Uh, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty

[Verse 1: redveil]
Keep them trucks up on the railing just a little bit longer
Landing make you stronger
Skin to skin with everything I pondered
So we don't take dishonor for that
Run up my commas, out the way and it won't be a problem
All my brothers climbing, we repellent to the bottom
Every second spent to never have another autumn
That was back when everyday was solemn
Now they falling under me, I'm leading every column
Meter doing jumping jacks, I'm leaning on the pedal
So much steam left on the asphalt, they fiending to say hello
Every season, I'ma blast off and reach that different level
Got my head up on a swivel and my hand close to the metal, get the medal
Bring it back to Largo, that P.G. baby never settle
Easy day to get him silent tryna meddle
'Veil adjacent to the pot, you bet not touch it 'til it settle
And I'm hitting every shot, boy that’'s the fucking fundamentals
Push it with conviction, hit this mission on the code
If they said that 'veil was missing, that shit fiction, on my soul
Ain't no permission, I envision giving me a simple road
I'm gon' take that trek alone, I'm gon' get it back in gold
Never fitting in that mold
My reflection one-of-one, these niggas sectioned into rows
My perception one-and-done, it's to the next soon as you fold
I attest I'm at they neck, I'm right above they collarbone, uh
Yeah, look, alright, wait
[Chorus: redveil]
Bitch, I can't trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh, wait
Bitch, I can't trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh

[Post-Chorus: redveil & Denzel Curry]
Uh, yeah, uh
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh, yeah
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh, uh (Win)
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Swim good through my stream of consciousness so ponder this
Wondering what it was like to grow up in my pond, I guess
Life is just a sandy beach, just sitting on the sands of time
So with these mighty hands of mine, I'm close to Adam's most divine
Float the mile on banks of memories, we had no chimneys
It's always hot, frozen cups and quarter juices hit the spot
Almost forgot, football in front of the crib with no socks
And barely no shoes, running back-and-forth on the block
With all the locals, fist fights had us falling out with each other
It's silly 'cause they my niggas but really, they are my brothers
In turn, they all made me tougher but rougher around the edges
But most importantly, see what's greater over the hedges
My name is D.C., baby, I ain't from D.C., baby
My dawg from P.G., baby, and I'm from that Z3, baby
Carol City, stand up, Dade County, stand up
You don't wanna drown in this wave, throw your hands up
You might also like[Chorus: redveil]
Bitch, I can't trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh, wait
Bitch, I can't trip 'bout shit 'cause I've fallen
Better feed my kin if you think about calling
I can tell you ain't about to win 'cause you stalling
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh

[Outro: redveil with Denzel Curry]
Uh, yeah, uh
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win, uh, uh
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win
I can tell you ain't about to win, shawty
I can tell you ain't about to win1Embed
