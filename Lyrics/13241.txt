​little person Lyrics[Verse]

I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me
I do my little job
And live my little life
Eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife
[Chorus]

And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say:
I know you
You're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun

[Bridge]
Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun

We'll take a road trip
Way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
You're the one I like the best

[Outro]
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and playYou might also likeEmbed
