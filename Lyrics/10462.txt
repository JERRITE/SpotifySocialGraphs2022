TranslationsSOPHIE - Faceshopping (Traducción al Español)Faceshopping Lyrics[Chorus 1: Cecile Believe]
My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

[Verse 1: Industry Plant]
Artificial bloom
Hydroponic skin
Chemical release
Synthesise the real
Plastic surgery
Social dialect
Positive results
Documents of life
[Pre-Chorus: Cecile Believe]
Oh
Nana-nana-nana-nana
Nana-nana-nana-nana-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-nana-nana

[Chorus 1: Cecile Believe]
My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front, front
I'm real when I shop my face

[Verse 2: Industry Plant, Cecile Believe]
Scalpel, lipstick, gel
Action, camera, lights
Violence in your heart
Memories of love (What?)
Percussive?

[Pre-Chorus: Cecile Believe]
Oh
Nana-nana-nana-nana (Hold it)
Nana-nana-nana-nana-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-nana-nana
