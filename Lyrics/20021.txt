Armoured Backpack Lyrics[Intro]
Call me when you want I'll be at home
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Blood on my shirt leave your body in the dirt, man
Take a seat while I'm preaching I'll be converting, man
Oh I might attack, armoured backpack
Only show my eyes 'coz I'll be searching for the stacks, oh
Flip my wrist, I'll be ripping, I'll be like every way
Keep on tripping and gripping, I'll be like anyway
Oh, I might attack, armoured backpack
Only show my eyes 'coz I'll be searching for the stacks, oh
[Post-Hook]
Searching for the stacks, oh
Searching for the stacks, oh
Yeah for the stacks, oh

[Interlude]
Call me when you want I'll be at home
Tell me everything you want to know
I'll be out here waiting on the road
Call me when you want I'll be at home

[Verse]
Yeah, feeling kinda bland
Yohji armour, Yohji jacket, Yohji on my lap
If I caught her with some water that was foreign
In some garden, with some garments
Drinking orange juice
Then I'd be glad, yeah
I could be that bad
I want you to be mad
Make me feel impossible
The drinking is an obstacle
I wish you weren't inoperable
I think the world that I would rule

[Pre-Hook]
Body flicker in the club
And Herraduras in my cup
I think I want to get it numb
But I can't seem to get enough
Wear designer any day
Drink tequila anyway
Think I want to be the one
And who will take my freedom mane?

Blood on my shirt leave your body in the dirt, man
Take a seat while I'm preaching I'll be converting, man
Oh I might attack, armoured backpack
Only show my eyes 'coz I'll be searching for the stacks, oh
Flip my wrist, I'll be ripping, I'll be like every way
Keep on tripping and gripping, I'll be like anyway
Oh, I might attack, armoured backpack
Only show my eyes 'coz I'll be searching for the stacks, oh

[Post-Hook]
Searching for the stacks, oh
Searching for the stacks, oh
Yeah for the stacks, oh

[Interlude]
Call me when you want I'll be at home
Tell me everything you want to know
I'll be out here waiting on the road
Call me when you want I'll be at home1Embed
