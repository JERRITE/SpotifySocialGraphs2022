ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
I might just fall in love with death
I might just fall in love with death tonight
I might just fall in love with death
I might just fall in love with death tonight
I lost myself, got nothin' left (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death tonight (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death tonight (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Kin$oul]
I go hard even when I'm depressed (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody out here got stress (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I guess life's a test (Yeah, yeah)
Take drugs 'til my eyes turn red (Yeah)

[Refrain: Cooliecut]
I'm feelin' real good
And you know that is how it should be (Uh-huh)
My vision blurry like I'm tipsy (Uh-huh)
I'm wishin', hopin' that you miss me (Uh-huh)
I'm wishin', hopin' that you miss me

[Verse 2: Bass Santana]
You stay like ten steps ahead of me
I can't trap you with this melody
I fell in love with your energy
Can't stand myself when you're mad at me
I refuse to pretend I'm someone else
Just to prove that I love you
I just need to keep my heart to myself
From this damage that love do
I can't live to fight another day
Is you down with me now, down with me now? Oh
Took my heart and took my love away
Is you down with me now, down with me now? Oh

And you know that is how it should be (Uh-huh)

I'm wishin', hopin' that you miss me (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
I might just fall in love with death
I might just fall in love with death tonight
I might just fall in love with death
I might just fall in love with death tonight
I lost myself, got nothin' left (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death tonight (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I might just fall in love with death tonight (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
