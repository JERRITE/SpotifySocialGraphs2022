Butterfly 2021 Lyrics[Verse 1: Ekoh]
Yeah, it’s kinda crazy how life goes
Until I met you, I always thought I would die alone
But now I know the feeling of heaven when both our eyes closed
With your head on my chest, letting the time go
And since I met her, know nothin’ has been the same
A picture perfect painting inside of a perfect frame
Wild child, got in some trouble back in the day
But I don't give a fuck about the reputation that you made, yeah
Keep it real, ride or die to the end
Nobody got my back like she do when it gets low
Fucks like a porn chick, parties like a rock star
Spray paint our names in a heart on this cop car
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ekoh]
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave here
Anything you need, just give me the time and place, I’ll be there
Anybody hatin' mistaken for thinking we care
And for the first time in a long time, I see clear, yeah
I’m hypnotized by the way that she feels
Ain't no limit to the love and the things we can build
Butterflies in her eyes, she got looks to kill
And if I die, she gon' be right there, so

[Chorus: Ekoh, Crazy Town]
Come my lady
Come, come, my lady
Be my butterfly, sugar, baby
Come my lady, you’re my pretty baby
I’ll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady
Come, come, my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar, baby
Come my lady, you’re my pretty baby
I’ll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 2: Crazy Town]
All the girls get excited when they play this song
Some had the chance but they played it wrong
I'm not the kind of guy that you take home to mom
But the thing I love about you is you know they're wrong
You don't want a sucker, want a man that's strong
The kind of guy that makes it hard to keep your panties on
I'm at your front door like I'm Amazon
And I don't get shy when the camera's on
Crazy Town, baby, you can do the dance
Another dirty love story like true romance
Heavy metal sex and slow jams
We hold hands
You're the only one, the other girls got no chance
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2: Crazy Town]
So sexual like my life line
Now's the right time to let your light shine
You never really know just what you might find
I'm never gonna hurt you in my right mind
Sex so hot, I got a new best friend
I take my tongue, tie a knot with a cherry stem
You know I rock hard but I move to the slow beat
Eggplant, moon, fire, pink heart emoji

[Chorus: Ekoh, Crazy Town]
Come my lady
Come, come, my lady
Be my butterfly, sugar, baby
Come my lady, you’re my pretty baby
I’ll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady
Come, come, my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar, baby
Come my lady, you’re my pretty baby
I’ll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Outro: Crazy Town]
