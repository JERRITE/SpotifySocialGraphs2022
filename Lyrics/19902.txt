Where I Go Lyrics[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Mm, mm-mm, hmm
Hmm

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
She wanna know where I've been
And who I seen
She wanna know where I'm goin'
And can we meet? (Oh)
She say I'm so terrible
But this is me (That's not my fault)
I love her from head to toe
And in between (Girl, I love all of you)
[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I know we do a lot of back and forth
I know we do a lot of fast and slow
You know I'm gon' contradict myself
I know you gon' ride the dick like a pro
I know you got a lot of faith in me
I know you put a lot of things on hold
I hope you got a policy
I know you got a lock on the whole thing

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I had to tell you somethin', tell you somethin' before I go
I left a lil' somethin' special in the envelope
I had to mail you somethin', tell me when it's at the door
And when you open it, I hope you get hysterical
I had to share it with somebody that I really trust
So when we celebrate, I'ma hit you up
I had to go and find a runnin' mate who didn't rush
I hope you know it was imperative for both of us

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
She wanna know where I've been (Where I've been)
And who I seen (Baby, that's no one)
She wanna know where I'm goin'
And can we meet?
She say I'm so terrible (Terrible)
But this is me (That's not my fault)
I love her from head to toe (Head to toe)
And in between (Girl, I love all of you)

I know we do a lot of back and forth
I know we do a lot of fast and slow
You know I'm gon' contradict myself
I know you gon' ride the dick like a pro (I know it)
I know you got a lot of faith in me
I know you put a lot of things on hold
I hope you got a policy
I know you got a lock on the whole thing

[Verse 2: H.E.R. & Anderson .Paak]
You know that you my motherfuckin' cinnamon apple (Yeah)
Know that when it come to lovin' you, I'm a natural
Know how much you hurt me, that's in the past though
When I'm all alone, better not be with that ho, oh-oh-oh
I had to deal with your sides and your pieces (Yeah, yeah)
I put two and two together in the sequence
I promise that I'm tryin' not to be on defense
But I'm reminded of it every time you leave

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & H.E.R.]
She wanna know where I've been
And who I seen (Baby, where been you goin'?)
She wanna know where I'm goin' (You goin')
And can we meet? (Ah, ah, ah)
She say I'm so terrible (Terrible)
But this is me (That's not my fault, don't you call me crazy, don't, don't, baby)
I love her from head to toe (You should know that)
And in between (And girl, I love all of you)
[Outro: H.E.R. & Anderson .Paak]
I know we do a lot of back and forth (Yeah)
Lot of fast and slow
Contradict myself (Contradict myself)
I'm gon' suck the dick like a pro (I know it)
Lot of faith in me
Lot of things on hold
I know you got it, got it, ooh, baby
That's true, ooh, ooh-ooh
I love you, ooh, oh-ah2Embed
