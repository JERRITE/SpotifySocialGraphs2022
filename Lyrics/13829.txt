Tried Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Send it forward I got you
Pretty important I had you
Will you make sure I loved it
If you would I

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it seems like I could be it all
Do you trip when you hear it all?
And burnt blood when you feel it all, yeah
[Bridge]
It could be better I wouldn't even know
Tried to call my bluff when you had your last go
And a keen forty, did you say you'd make my last show?
I could call but you'd get to hang up, up

[Chorus]
Tried up, I’m tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up, untie for me
I'm tried up, I'm tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up

[Verse 2]
Keep it locked, unbothered
Keep it boxed I don't want it
Did they tell you I was sorry?
It didn't feel right

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it seems like I could be it all
Do you tripp when you hear it all?
And burnt blood when you feel it all, yeah

[Bridge]
I mean, it could be better I wouldn't even know
Tried to call my bluff when you had your last go
And a keen forty, did you say you'd make my last show?
I could call but you'd get to hang up, up

Tried up, I’m tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up, untie for me
I'm tried up, I'm tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up

[Bridge]
Stand on your motorbike
And for the most part I don't lie
There was just crowded heights (There was just crowded)
Did you predict out there was darkened?
Did you try and see it for me? ('Cause I)
And you had me climbing old trees (Gimme)
'Cause the rings were older than I ever knew before
It could be better
It could it could be better
It could be better
It could it could be better
It could be better
It could it could be better
It could be better
It could it could be better

[Bridge]
It could be better I wouldn't even know
Tried to call my bluff when you had your last go
And a keen forty, did you say you'd make my last show?
I could call but you'd get to hang up, up
[Chorus]
Tried up, I’m tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up, untie for me
I'm tried up, I'm tried up, un-try for me huh?
I’m tied up, I'm tied up4Embed
