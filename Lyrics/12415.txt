What You Deserve LyricsTell me just how deep you would dig
If you could bury me
I'd claw my way back through hell to bring you to your knees
I wanna see your face as you watch the world fall apart
At the seams

I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
You should know
What goes around comes around
You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You think you can sit back and act like everything's okay
Stripped of your crown, knocked off your throne
It's the price you pay
I wanna see your face as you watch the world fall apart
At the seams

I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
You should know
What goes around comes around

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve
You might also likeYou crossed the line
The wrong, the right
The dark, the night
You cry wolf
I've heard it a thousand times

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

You get what you came for
This time you've gone too far
I think you should know what you've done
You get what you deserve

(You get what you came)
(You've gone too far)
(You've gone too far)
You get what you deserve
(You get what you came, came)
(This time you've gone too far)
You get what you deserve

(You've gone too far)
(You've gone too far)1Embed
