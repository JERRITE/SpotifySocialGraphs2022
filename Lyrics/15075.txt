Crashing Foreign Cars LyricsThere's another sucker born
Every minute lord
Take her out and pay for a good time
Never know what you can afford
Another wreck and time to collect
More souvenirs
Gone another million miles
No worse for the wear

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute lord
And he deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car
Swear to god I'm wrecking it all
Your happy end
Spin around the block in half the time
I know where you've been
Too bad you're not feeling too bad
Wanna be my friend?
Got another ride and you're taking off
Met a General Motor man

And there's a sucker born
Every other minute lord
And he deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car

There's a sucker born
Every other minute lord, I know
He deserves you more
You know I'll only crash this car

You know I'll only crash
You know I'll only crash this car, dear lord
Know I'll only crash
You know I'll only crash this carYou might also like1Embed
