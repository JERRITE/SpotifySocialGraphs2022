Is this love - 2008 - remaster LyricsI should have known better than to let you go alone
It's times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again
I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you babe? Back's against the wall
I Need you by my side to tell me, "It's alright"
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore
Is this love that Im feeling?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love cause its really got a hold on me
A hold on me
I can't stop the feeling, Ive been this way before
But with you Ive found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms
Is this love that Im feeling?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love cause its really got a hold on me
A hold on me
Is this love that Im feeling?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
