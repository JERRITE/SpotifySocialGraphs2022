Mortal Reminder Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blinded by hate brought by the fall
As I swear death to all
You will feel my vengeance
As I claim your mortal soul

[Verse 2]
I will punish and destroy
Those responsible for this ploy
I will seek a thousand deaths
I will bring a thousand years of war
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All that I had taken away
My home is gone, and my loved ones slain
For every sleep claims a piece of me
Every waking moment, every single dream

[Chorus]
As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian

[Verse 3]
Now I seek the blood of those
Who claimed the innocent
I will hunt the enemy to the last
I will banish and rejoice
The final breath of foes
You will see what you have made
You will see what I have finally become

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All that I had laid to the waste
My spirit broken and just memories remain
For every day claims a piece of me
Every waking hour claims my inner peace
My inner peace
You might also like[Chorus]
As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian2Embed
