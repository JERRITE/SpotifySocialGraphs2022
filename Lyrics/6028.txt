TranslationsPortuguÃªsAnyone for You (Tiger Lily) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tiger lily, moved to the city
She just turned twenty-one
And then I said, "Here's my number, hit me up
If you're needing anyone"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I could be anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone for you
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

[Chorus]
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light
Be your light (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Well, I gave her love but it wasn't enough
So she called me up just to call it off
I can't afford to make that mistake this time
And if you're flying over the Serengeti
Tiger lily, don't forget me
The way I am, not the way I was, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
And I could be anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone for you
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

[Chorus]
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light
Be your light (Light, light, light)

[Bridge]
Anyone for you
You might also like[Chorus]
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light (Woo)
Be your light (Woo)

[Outro]
Oh
I can be your light1Embed
