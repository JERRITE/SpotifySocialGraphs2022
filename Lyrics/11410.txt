Lady dâ€™Arbanville LyricsMy Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
Yes, you will be my fill

My Lady d'Arbanville
Why does it grieve me so?
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low
Why do you breathe so low
My Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
Yes you will be my fill

My Lady d'Arbanville
You look so cold tonight
Your lips feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white
Your skin has turned to white

My Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
Yes, you will be my fill

La la la, la la la
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la la ah
La la la la la la, la la la la la laaaaaaaaa

My Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you grieve me so?
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low
Why do you breathe so low

Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die
This rose will never die

I loved you my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
But this rose will never die
This rose will never die1Embed
