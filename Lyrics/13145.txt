Describe Lyrics[Verse 1]
No bells anymore
Just my stomach rumbling

[Chorus]
Can you describe them for me?
Can you describe them for me?

[Verse 2]
The lock on the door
Is barely holding
[Chorus]
Can you just wait here with me?
Can you just wait here with me?

[Bridge]
Ooh, his lovin' felt like ribbons
Ooh, an echo in the canyon
Ooh, his lovin' felt like ribbons
Ooh, an echo in the canyon

[Chorus]
Can you just find him for me?
Can you describe them for me?
Can you just find him for me?You might also like3Embed
