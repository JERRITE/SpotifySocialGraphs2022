Wanna Get With U Lyrics[Intro: Teddy Riley & Guy]
Yo, drop it
I wanna get with you (I wanna)
So let's get together (Come on, I wanna)
So let's get together (Come on, come on, I wanna)
So let's get together (Come on, come on, I wanna)
I wanna get with you (Come on, come on, come on)
(I wann—, I wann—)

[Verse 1: Teddy Riley & Guy]
I wanna get with you 'cause you got a lot (I wanna)
You're sure 'nough kickin', you lookin' hot (I wanna)
I wanna get with you if you got the time (I wanna)
Baby, we can swing it, but you gotta make up your mind
(I wann—, I wann—, I wanna)
Gotta get with you, gonna make you sweat (I wanna)
I can't wait just to make you wet (I wanna)
And if I get with you, can't forget the crew (I wanna)
So you can get your girlfriends and I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
(I wann—, I wann—, I wanna)
[Chorus: Guy & Teddy Riley]
I wanna get with you
Oh, oh, I gotta get with you
(I wanna) I wanna get with you
Oh, ow, I wanna get with you
(I wanna) I wanna get with you
Oh, just gotta get with you
(I wanna) I wanna get with you
Yo, bust, I wanna get with you
(I wanna)

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley & Guy]
Yo, I wanna get with you
Tell me is that much to ask for? (I wanna)
Nothing more than a spare minute
I got time if you wanna get with it (I wanna)
Whatever you want, I'll get it
I got cash, now help me spend it (I wanna)
Don't worry, if you're broke, I'll fix it
Like a flat then blow you up wicked
(I wann—, I wann—, I wanna)
Got the ingredients, you need me to mix it
So, baby, let me go to work (I wanna)
I'll show you how I go to work
Have the whole thing sewed up like a shirt (I wanna)
Give me a chance to show you
Spend some time, I need time to know you (I wanna)
After that, we're in like the New Jack Swing
Until it's through, I wanna get with you (I want you)

Yo, Aaron, take it to the bridge

[Bridge: Aaron Hall, Teddy Riley & Guy]
You got what I want (Uh, I wanna)
(You got what I want)
You're so fine, I cannot front (I wanna, I wanna)
On my knees, begging you please (I wanna)
I'll do anything in the world to get with you (C'mon, baby, come on)
(I wann—, I wann—, I wanna)
[Verse 3: Teddy Riley & Guy]
I wanna freak you, freak you, girl (I wanna get—)
If you think you can rock my world (I wanna, I wanna)
Bring all the girls to the men with clout (I wanna get—)
And then we'll see who can bust who out (I wanna)
If I had the chance to get with you (I wanna get—)
There's nothing in the world that I can't do (I wanna get—, I wanna)
Say we get together tomorrow at two (I wanna get—)
I wanna get with you, hmm
