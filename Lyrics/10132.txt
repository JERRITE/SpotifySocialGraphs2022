Something In The Water Lyrics[Intro]
(Yo, KP, that you?)

[Verse 1: Tone Stith]

But you'll never replace me
You still on my mind

There's something in the water (It don't feel the same)
There's something in the water (Oh, oh-oh, oh, something)
Must be something in the water (It don't feel the same, no)
'Cause you still on my mind
There's something in the—
