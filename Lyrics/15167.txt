Cherry Cola Lyrics[Verse 1]
I sip the liquor but it's much too harsh
Chase me down, chase me down make a stop
I know she said that she fuck with a old soul
Unfortunate 'cause I sold mine to the devil for this mojo
She think it's just the soco
But she make my breath stop like she the centerfold
I've been searching for something sweet
That's cool in the summer and takes away this heat
Now, vanilla coke, she's much too bland
And lime trying hard chasing all the other men
Well, I'm just searching for classic and timeless
Oh, hey, there I think I found it
[Chorus]
She my cherry cola
She gonna' keep me sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay
I'm just sipping one thing

She my cherry cola
She gonna' keep my sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay
I'm just sipping one thing

[Bridge]
If it's not you, then it won't do
If it's not you, then it won't do
If it's not you, then it won't do

[Verse 2]
Before you I was drowning way deep in this fountain
Pulled me to the surface, no way I deserve this
Sweet like that sugar cane, I'm so glad that you came
No clouds in my sky, 'cause she bring that sunshine
Hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
Don't let me drown, don't let me drown
You might also like[Chorus]
She my cherry cola
She gonna' keep me sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay
I'm just sipping one thing

She my cherry cola
She gonna' keep me sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay
I'm just sipping one thing13Embed
