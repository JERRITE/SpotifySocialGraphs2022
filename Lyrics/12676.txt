TranslationsРусскийWords Ain’t Enough Lyrics[Intro]
(Mmm-mmm)

[Verse 1]
You're fire, you're proud
But you're cold when it counts
It's open and shut

[Chorus]
You can say you love me, but
Words ain't enough
[Post-Chorus]
(Mmm-mmm)

[Verse 2]
You want me, you say
But then you turn away
And I'm pressin' my luck

[Chorus]
You can say you love me, but
Words ain't enough

[Bridge]
(Ahhh)
Cut myself into pieces easy to chew
(Ahhh)
Carve me up into someone you'd like to choose
Till I'm only pieces of you

[Chorus]
So, you can say you love me, but
Words ain't enough
So, you can say you love me, but
Words ain't enoughYou might also like2Embed
