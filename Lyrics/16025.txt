Big Time Rush Lyrics[Bridge: All]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Kendall Schmidt & James Maslow, All]
Make it count, play it straight
Don't look back, don't hesitate
When you go big time
What you want, what you feel
Never quit it, make it real
When you roll big time (Oh-oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Carlos Pena Jr., James Maslow & Logan Henderson, All]
Hey! (Oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh)
Listen to your heart now (Eh)
Hey! (Oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh)
Don't you feel the rush?
Hey! (Oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh)
Better take your shot now
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Hey!: oh!)

[Chorus: All]
Go and shake it up! What cha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya gotta live it big time

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Carlos Pena Jr., Logan Henderson & James Maslow, All]

Go for broke, make it clear
Gotta go big time (Oh, hey)
Make it work get it right
Change the world over night
Gotta dream big time (Ouh-ouh)

Look around
*Nothings really as it seems, nothing but dreams*
You and I
*Gonna make a brand new sound, like we own this town* (We own this town)
We can fly
*Now our feet are off the ground, we'll never look down*
Welcome to the big time (Time)
All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine
Welcome to the good times (Times)
Life will never be the same!

[Outro: All]
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got, so ya gotta live it big time26Embed
