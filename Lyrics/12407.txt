Toxic - explicit album version LyricsCatch a fire, fire it up
Corrupt, stirring it up
It's burning hot, drifting
Hitting every slot
With a drop kick, it's toxic
Trouble, like your girl in a mosh pit
I've lost it
And that's the only way that we rock shit
Banging heads and ripping threads
If I wasn't rocking shows
I'd be better off dead
With a one, two
One word can destroy your whole crew
And that's toxic
Toxic, loud and obnoxious
Crazy Town's toxic
With that, rock your block
Shit
Toxic, popping more lip
We love to talk shit
Rocking your block with that
Straight out the block shit
Toxic

A Buddha, ballistic
Blacklisted, twist of fate
My vocal's fatal
As naughty block concoctions
Rock your cradle
I thought I'd wait 'til
The timing was right
To ignite
Cause people like me
We only come out at night
I rock the main line
And party with fine bitches
Which is a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
So, who's the crew with?
More hoes than vivid
Lyrics explicit
So, fuck the critics
We leave them hanging
Like INXS
You might also likeToxic thresholds of
Colombian gold
You can't roll how we roll
We possess your soul
And push the panic
Is it godly or satanic?
Toxic or organic?
Manic minds refined or frantic
Just the way we planned it
See, we be stomping around
The planet
And we stand alone
We infiltrate your chromosomes
No clone
Our DNA has got a strain
Of its own
And it's toxicEmbed
