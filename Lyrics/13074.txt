You Broke My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't
Don't give up
'Cause you're crying
It isn't enough

[Verse 2]
Love
No I'm not in love
'Cause you're not worth it
You're not worth thinking of
You're not worth thinking of
[Verse 3]
Oh, run
Yeah, I saw you run
From the television
From the TELE/VISIONS
Oh, run
God I saw you run
Now I'll never never never never never never
See you again
I'll never see you again

[Verse 4]
And cry
Oh I want you to cry
For what you did to me
On that night
'Cause I'm scared
God I'm terrified
What will happen to my life
To my life

[Verse 5]
So don't
Give up
'Cause you tried
'Cause you tried
'Cause you tried
But it wasn't good enough
