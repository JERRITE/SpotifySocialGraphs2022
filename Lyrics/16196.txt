Love Myself Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Yeah (Hey)

[Verse 1]
When I get chills at night, I feel it deep inside
Without you, yeah (Hey)
Know how to satisfy, keepin' that tempo right
Without you, yeah (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures in my mind on replay
I'm gonna touch the pain away (Hey)
I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name
[Chorus]
I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
I love me (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I take it nice and slow, feeling good on my own
Without you, yeah (Hey)
Got me speakin' in tongues, the beautiful it comes
Without you, yeah (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna put my body first
And love me so hard till it hurts (Hey)
I know how to scream out the words
Scream the words

[Chorus]
I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
I love me
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (Hey)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
I love me
