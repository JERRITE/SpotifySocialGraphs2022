I See You (Theme From Avatar) Lyrics[Intro]
I see you
I see you

[Verse 1]
Walking through a dream, I see you
My light in darkness, breathing hope of new life
Now I live through you and you through me, enchanted
I pray in my heart that this dream never ends

[Chorus]
I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love
[Verse 2]
You teach me how to see all that's beautiful
My senses touch a world I never pictured
Now I give my hope to you, I surrender
I pray in my heart that this world never ends

[Chorus]
I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life, I offer my love, for you

[Bridge]
When my heart was never open
And my spirit never free
To the world that you have shown me
But my eyes could not envision
All the colors of love and of life evermore
Evermore
(I see me through your eyes)

[Chorus]
I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love
I live through your love
You might also like[Outro]
I see you
I see you2Embed
