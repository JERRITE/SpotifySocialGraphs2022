Sha la la la lee - mono version LyricsPicked her up on a Friday night
Sha la la la lee, yeah
I knew everything gonna be alright
Sha la la la lee, yeah
Sha la la la lee

I asked her 'where do you wanna go?'
Sha la la la lee, yeah
Well we went someplace, I don't know

I held her close and I asked her if
She was gonna be my baby
It felt so good when she answered me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

She looked good and she moved so fine
Sha la la la lee, yeah
And all the guys knew she was mine

She was gonna be my baby
It felt so good when she answered me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeh, oh yeah
