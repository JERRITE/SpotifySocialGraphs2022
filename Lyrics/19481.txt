Maybe I Do Lyrics(Huey Mack - Verse)

I came to raise hell
Hope I got good enough homies to post bail
Cause I don't really think i'd do that well in jail
Tequila got me moving slower than two snails or post mail
Who you know that got it like this
Only chubby kid you know to end up taking your bitch
Wanna leave i'll hit the uber we can bounce real quick
I'll get you off like Johnny Cochran and I mean that shit
Young, chubby, money hungry sex symbol
Every time i'm in your city shit liver than Jimmy Kimmel
You know, wanna party than I know where to start
I got the loud I burn it down like it was Joan of Arc
I make a song I kill it every time dog
They hate me cause I speak my fuckin' mind dog
I don't care i'm poolside just fine dog
With two women cleaning up the wood like Pinesol
(James Davidson and Huey Mack - Chorus)

Tequila got me feeling crazy, forgive me for the things I say
When I get drunk I love to talk my shit, know I don't really feel that way
Or Maybe I Do
Or Maybe I Do
Or Maybe I Do

(Futuristic - Verse)
Yo, I talk my shit when i'm faded
I beat your ass like Jaden Smith after trainin'
I fuck around and leave someone's face on the pavement
Two bottles got a nigga walking circles like i'm racing
Grand theft auto, wasted
House party take your girlfriend to the basement
Cops come tryna shut down the operation
You might get saved by the bell something like slater
Like a waiter here's a tip lil homie take a hike
I like my peach ciroc with sprite
I'm superman no kryptonite
I might just fuck your bitch tonight
Man let me talk my shit tonight
Got all these people watching me like you used to watch nick at night

(James Davidson and Huey Mack - Chorus)

When I get drunk I love to talk my shit, know I don't really feel that way
Or Maybe I Do
Or Maybe I Do
Or Maybe I Do
