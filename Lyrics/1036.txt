T-Shirts (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe I can sail and stay afloat
Maybe I can dive but I won't
'Cause I can't face the tide alone
Sitting on the edge of windows
Where we used to talk and you'd smoke
But now I'm up here on my own

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Boxes full of years in empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you
[Chorus]
So you can
Keep my t-shirts for what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos, I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again
Someday
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I know we haven't spoken in weeks
It's like we only meet in my sleep
And I can't wait to close my eyes
I found the missing earring you wore
The night you threw me out and slammed the door
But you won't let me back this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now it haunts me in these empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you

[Chorus]
So you can
Keep my t-shirts for what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos, I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again
Someday
Oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Keep my t-shirts for what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos, I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again
SomedayEmbed
