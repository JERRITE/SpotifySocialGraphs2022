Lockdown Forever LyricsThis isolation is a blessing of heaven
All obligations of my former life fade
Completely safe, I'm in my apartment
For two years now, shorts parade

First they told us to plunder the food stores
Be prepared, a virus might come
Then they closed off the cities and highways
Home alone I noticed the fun

Karaoke games! Knitting and yoga! Never felt ashamed!
I want lockdown forever
TV surfing, pizza falt rate
Got my record collection
Metal music all night and day

I met a woman on somе internet party
Love in an еra when mask became king
Sex via Zoom, no physical romance
Porno movie worshiping!

Can't impress me with fake news and hate speech
Brewing beer instead I will learn
Writing memoirs on my toilet paper
Ain't that great, my daily concern?

Karaoke games! Knitting and yoga! Never felt ashamed!

I want lockdown forever
TV surfing, pizza falt rate
Got my record collection
Metal music all night and day

Karaoke games! Knitting and yoga! Never felt ashamed!

I want lockdown forever
TV surfing, pizza falt rate
Got my record collection
Metal music all night and day
It's my favorite outbreak!
Sweet embargo, social hygiene
Booked my online vacation
Watching football is my vaccine
