Iâ€™m Not Dead Yet LyricsSlow down my chest can't keep up
With the rate that you're moving
Now were moving

Deeper and deeper
Now were falling
Faster and faster
There's nothing left

Please wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet
You can't seem to hide
What's inside
You can't seem to hide
What's inside

Deeper and deeper
Now were falling
Faster and faster
There's nothing left

Please wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet

Lets shake things up
Lets shake things up

Please wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so
You might also likePlease wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet1Embed
