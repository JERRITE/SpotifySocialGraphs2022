Glass Walls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you believe in destiny and fate
Do you say now or never
Or never too late
The time has passed
But I remember everything
A flash that faded fast
But my bruised heart still sings
It sings

[Chorus]
Glass walls and waterfalls
Can't stop your light
From reaching my eyes
Kingdoms can rise and fall
I won't lose the key
If you find the door
[Verse 2]
When the mist descends
And hope is gone
We'll freeze a dream
To last until another dawn
Cos when the mountains fall
And crumble into dust
Our bones may turn to stone
But hearts like ours don't rust
Don't rust

[Chorus]
Glass walls and waterfalls
Can't stop your light
From reaching my eyes
Kingdoms can rise and fall
I won't lose the key
If you find the door

Glass walls and waterfalls
Can't stop your light
From reaching my eyes
Kingdoms can rise and fall
I won't lose the key
If you find the doorYou might also likeEmbed
