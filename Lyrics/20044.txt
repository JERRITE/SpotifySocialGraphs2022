Stars in the Sky Lyrics[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
Take me away in your rocket ship
Been a long day, get me out of here
Stay in a state of the greatest bliss
Whenever I'm in your atmosphere
I'm so glad that I've got you
You're my dream come true (Ooh)
We are divine, match made in Sirius
We defy time, nothin' else matters when
Two stars collide
You are my one and true love, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Phora, Phora & Jhené Aiko]
You know I love you
I see a halo above you
Planets align when I touch you
Stare at the stars in the sky, in the sky
Said I complete you
Do you need me like I need you?
All that I want is to keep you
Here with me right by my side, by my side (Uh)

[Chorus: Phora, Phora & Jhené Aiko]
I'll be runnin' back, I'll be runnin' back
You're my medicine, you take my pain away
Baby, love me back, give me somethin' back
'Cause I'm drownin' in you like a tidal wave
I'll be runnin' back, I'll be runnin' back
You're my medicine, you take my pain away
Baby, love me back, give me somethin' back
'Cause I'm drownin' in you like a tidal wave

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh
Ooh (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Phora, Phora & Jhené Aiko]
Your eyes shine like the stars in the sky
You're the one that make me feel alive
I just wanna be the reason why
Reason why you smile all the time
I just wanna be the one you need
Butterflies every time I breathe
Late at night when I go to sleep
You're the one that's always in my dreams, yeah
Full moon, late night conversations
Taught me true love, taught me patience
Your lips, your smile, perfect paintin'
Need me, tell me, I'll be waitin'

Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh
Ooh (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Phora, Phora & Jhené Aiko]
You know I love you
I see a halo above you
Planets align when I touch you
Stare at the stars in the sky, in the sky
Said I complete you
Do you need me like I need you?
All that I want is to keep you
Here with me right by my side, by my side (Uh)

[Chorus: Phora & Jhené Aiko]
I'll be runnin' back, I'll be runnin' back
You're my medicine, you take my pain away
Baby, love me back, give me somethin' back
'Cause I'm drownin' in you like a tidal wave
I'll be runnin' back, I'll be runnin' back
You're my medicine, you take my pain away
Baby, love me back, give me somethin' back
'Cause I'm drownin' in you like a tidal wave11Embed
