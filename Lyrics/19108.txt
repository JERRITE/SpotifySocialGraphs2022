My Bay LyricsAcross the bay now
Past our home towns
Backlit for one last glimpse
Of surging shoals and autumn browns

Stay wicked
You are forgiven
All are forgiven now that
Alms abound in escape routes

Sunset lights the way
Above my bay
There's a deeper, darker torrent
One mile high
So if you're feeling bold or brave now
Wave bye-bye
As the contrails vanish in southern skies
Above my bay
At the first sign of tears
They turn their heads away
Yet so transfixed by the blood on the highway
And the vestiges of a virile heart
Are pulsing me so far away

You were desperate
So you used me
Don't say your sorrys yet cause
I’ve abused most everything

Still I’m doomed
And better off dead
Don’t throw away just yet
Those voodoo dolls, Darling
I'm hanging on by a thread

Sunset lights the way
Above my bay
There’s a deeper, darker torrent
One mile high
So if you're feeling bold or brave now
Wave bye-bye
As the contrails vanish in southern skies
Above my bay
You might also likeThey bring it in
They cut it right in front of me
I'm so transfixed by the blood on the highway
And the vestiges of a virile heart
Are pulsing me so far away

Across the bay now
Past our home towns
Don't throw away just yet
Those voodoo dolls, Darling
I'm hanging on by a thread

Sunset lights the way
Above my bay
There's a deeper, darker torrent
One mile high
So if you're feeling bold or brave now
Wave bye-bye
As the contrails vanish in southern skies
Above my bayEmbed
