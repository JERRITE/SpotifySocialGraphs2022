Killed by Death Lyrics[Intro]
Show on!

[Verse 1]
If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventure
And I'm a reptile too

[Chorus]
But it don't make no difference
Cause I ain't gonna be easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone
[Verse 2]
I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

[Chorus]
But it don't make no difference
Cause I ain't gonna be easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone

[Bridge 1]
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone's gonna killed by death, someone
Someone

[Guitar Solo 1]
