TranslationsPortuguÃªsSet Me Free Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know what I did to deserve all of this
I don't wanna be rude or on the defensive
But I've been goin' through it, too
And I know you feel used, I know you've been hurt
Anything I did to make you feel worse
I'd take it all back if I could

[Pre-Chorus]
And nothing I say will ease the pain
Why must I hurt for you to feel okay?
[Chorus]
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)
And I don't need your apology (Let me be)
I don't recognize you, not anymore
You're not the love that I fell for
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)

[Verse 2]
I've been runnin' away, I've been facin' my fears
Tell my mama I'm okay while I'm holdin' back tears
It's been a fuckin' year
And I've been doin' my time, I've been workin' on me
Wasn't sure I'd survive, never felt so weak
And nothin' really seemed to help it

[Pre-Chorus]
And nothing I say will ease the pain
Why do I have to hurt for you to feel okay?

[Chorus]
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)
And I don't need your apology (Let me be)
I don't recognize you, not anymore
You're not the love that I fell for
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)

I hope you know that I still care about you dearly
But I've gotta lock the door and throw away the key
And I hope you know that I still care about you, darlin'
I won't ever let you hurt me how you hurt me
Again, ever again

[Chorus]
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)
And I don't need your apology (Let me be)
I don't recognize you, not anymore
You're not the love that I fell for
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)
You don't get to take all of me (Set me free)

[Outro]
You don't get to take all of me
