What’s the Issue Lyrics[Verse]
You can look into my eyes, see the demon in me
She wanna have my baby, she like put that semen in me
I told my niggas let em live bring that nigga to me
I'm so anonymous and ain't no nigga bigger than me
My niggas kill for money, but for me they kill ya for free
When you jumped off that porch niggas in the middle of the street
Better be cool cause if you don't I'll hit ya ass with that heat
I told my mom I'm on a mission to take over the streets
I'm in that big body Bentley, pistol under the seat
I make these big booty bitches wash the dishes for me
And if you yelling bout some beef, bet not be mentioning me
Bitch my shades cost a G, double G's on my feet
She eat my babies, I refuse to take a bitch out to eat
We got 380's, Mac 11's, and we got 223's
Michael Jordan's on my feet bitch that's 223's
I just bought me a finger choppa for a couple of thieves
It ain't no pressure, get ya kill for a couple of fee's
We ridin foregin, put some bullet holes in ya entry
Dope man sellin dope, bitch how many ya need
She said Lud Foe is you gon fuck me
I said bitch I'll see, she said Lud Foe you burning up
I told that bitch I agree
I gotta shout out Mama Dukes, just for raising the Beast
I name these bullets Tylenol put you pussy's to sleep, aye I put the pussy to sleep
This nigga said he coming for me, but when I run into that Nigga he be running from me, bitch
Lil nigga you get RIP'ED, Balmain's on me use to rock
LRG'S bitch
I fucked this bitch named Victoria, and she keep begging me to keep her a seeeecret
I hit the mall buy it all, fuck a check up
Lil nigga I ain't really with that cheap shit
I seen him on the internet tryna sneak diss, but I know he ain't Really with that street shit
Nina ross, she a freak bitch make her tongue kiss
Any nigga wanna sneak diss
We pull up on ya ass with them Glocks out
Mistake me for a janitor the way I bring them mops out
He running out of time he done clocked out
I tote a Glock, but I still can box you get knocked out
Remember selling poles at the trap house
Now I'm doing shows adding money in my stash house
He fucking with me wrong I'd spazz out
Ain't shit to put some money on his head I'll cash out
Nigga, there's shooters that ain't shoot at shit
We pull up on you with them extended clips on that movie shit
Nigga, I heard you on that goofy shit, hating ass nigga
On my dick on that groupie shit
Nigga, already know we do this shit, all my niggas win we ain't really with that losing shit
You figure, you thinking that we cool and shit
Dissing in ya raps 'Ima show you how the uzi spit
I'm off pills and liquor, riding with the steel finna kill a nigga bitch. And no I don't feel these niggas
What’s a fucking monkey to a real gorilla bitch
We riding late on that hot shit, I snuck inside the club
With the slump free, fresher than the cock pit
I'm a young nigga dripped in gold
I'ma go getter, she keep thinking she my girlfriend
I don't go with her
I got heart, fuck a body guard, I fear no nigga
Play it smart If you don't play ya part, you a smoke nigga
I run them bands up fast, never been a slow nigga
Hit the gas, do the dash, murcielago nigga
I'm out West 290, I’m a young Chicagorilla
He know where to find us, if he tryna bombard with us
Put them bullet holes in ya anus, if you fuck with us
And we gon make a fuck nigga famous put him on a picture
We roll a fuck nigga like a swisher, make a nigga bitch
Suck my dick then I dismiss her
She crying,  ya mama need some tissue
When it hit you, now ya mama miss you
FUCK NIGGA WHAT'S THE ISSUE!You might also like3Embed
