Walk Like That LyricsI thought I was giving you gold
All my melodies were sung for you
Now I see how it all unfolds
And I can't close my eyes anymore

You were always troubling me
Trying to make me see what you see
You've given up, Oh my friend, looks like you're dying for inspiration
Can't get up, can't pretend, I'm not into imitations

I don’t walk like that, and talk like that, like you want to
I just wear my black, and talk my smack, and do what I wanna do
Cuz I don't care
If you don't care
I thought I was honestly yours
Girls are always doing their chores for you
I'm done, giving up on this useless conversation
I've had enough, had enough. No I'm not into imitations

I don't walk like that, and talk like that, like you want to
I just wear my black, and talk my smack, and do what I wanna do
I don't walk like that, and talk like that, like you want to
I just wear my black, and talk my smack, and do what I wanna do

Cuz I don't care
If you don't care
Cuz I don't care
If you don't care


Why you throwin me shade, Muffin?
Trying to take me away
Why you throwin me shade, my friend?
It's not like you were here to stay
Why you throwin me shade, Muffin? My friend, Muffin
Why you throwin me shade, Muffin? My friend, Muffin

I don't really know what you want from me
Medicate yourself and get back to me
I don't really know what you want from me
Medicate yourself and get back to me
I don't really know what you want from me
Medicate yourself and get back to me
I don’t really know what you want from me
I don’t really know, I don’t really know
You might also like
I don't walk like that, and talk like that, like you want to
I just wear my black, and talk my smack, and do what I wanna do

I don't care
If you don't care
I don't care
If you don't careEmbed
