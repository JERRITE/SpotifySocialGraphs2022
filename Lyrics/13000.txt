Birds Dont Sing Lyrics[Verse 1]
She said "How could you joke at a time like this?
I know why, cause this is what you wanted all along now, isn't it?
I think that all you ever really ever wanted was a reason to complain
That never stopped you before, don't let it get in your way"
Those are her words, not mine
As far as I'm concerned, we could've had a good time
So, if you walk out that door in disgust
I guess there's nothing more to discuss

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye
[Samples from Dangerously Yours]
(Over and over again)
("Well, um...yes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")
("You don't sound 'a little sick' to me.")

[Verse 2]
Don't listen to my music, don't lie in my bed
Don't listen to the references to things that you might have actually said
'Cause those are my words, not yours
As far as I'm concerned, it could have been a lot worse
I wasn't trying to avoid the confrontation
She isn’t crying, she’s just making conversation

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye
