Road Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
You gave road head on a turnpike exit
Going home, going home
Last ditch desperate, like a makeshift siphon
Pump and run, pump and run
Pump and run, pump and run

[Chorus]
Run, run
Run, run
Run
[Verse 2]
"Dream on, baby," were his last words to me
"Dream on, baby"
So dreaming baby took that corkscrewed highway
Lightless miles of big rigs
Lightless miles, miles and miles

[Outro]
Home, home, home, home
Home, home, ho-home, home
Home, ho-home, home, home
Home, home, home, homeYou might also like3Embed
