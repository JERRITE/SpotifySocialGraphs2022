Six Shooter Lyrics[Verse 1]
I took a
Cheap shot; A clean miss
Burning my defenses by the shaking of her hips

And then she
Moves in; A quick kiss
Breathing down my neck, she had me wrapped around her wrist

I try to
Break loose; Tight grip
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip
It was a
Lost cause; A fast fight
She ain't taking any prisoners and she's through playing nice

[Chorus]
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And so I
Break off, I gave in
Feeling pretty good about the trouble that I'm in
She got me
Beat down and bruised up
I'm bleeding, barely breathing, but I can not get enough

[Chorus]
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"

Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up" (Yeah)

[Bridge]
She gets me deep in the chest
Straight through my bullet-proof vest
She kisses like a grenade
Like a blade, or Bayonet
She gets me deep in the chest
Straight through my bullet-proof vest
She kisses like a grenade
Like a blade, or Bayonet
She gets me deep in the chest
Straight through my bullet-proof vest
She kisses like a grenade
Like a blade, or Bayonet

[Chorus]
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up"
Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds
Yeah she's a sweet six shooter, she knows how to get down
Until the kick-back when my heart hits the ground
She said "You think you're so tough, baby put your hands up" (Yeah)4Embed
