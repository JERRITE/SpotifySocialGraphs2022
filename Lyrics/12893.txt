​chasing kites Lyrics[Verse 1]
It’s a thin, thin line and I've walked both sides of it
See the other side appear so tempting, worth dying for it
And your limbs, aching out of want
Absorbing your every thought
Worth risking it all for
Working its wonders and now for you

[Chorus]
Over the ocean outcast, with nowhere to go
(Nowhere to go, nowhere to go)
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow
(We let it go, we let it go)
The storm that's drawing near
It calms and the air is cleared
Waste my youth chasing kites
I know will blow out of my hands
[Verse 2]
Push our heads in the sand, there is nothing here to seek
No discovery of mine will be safe in these seas
You feel that bitter taste on your tongue
Swallow your every wrong
Let your sins fill your lungs
Ending all worries now for you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Over the ocean outcast, with nowhere to go
(Nowhere to go, nowhere to go)
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow
(We let it go, we let it go)
The storm that's drawing near
It calms and the air is cleared
Waste my youth chasing kites
I know will blow out of my hands

[Outro]
Overlooking our past, letting it go
A brighter forecast, new winds will blow
The storm that's drawing near
Will calm when the air is cleared
Waste my youth chasing kites I know will blowYou might also like16Embed
