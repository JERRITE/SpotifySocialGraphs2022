Someone to Blame Lyrics[Chorus]
Everyone needs someone to blame (Oh-oh-oh)
And this time, think it's gonna be me (Oh-oh-oh)
Guess you need another villain for your story
God knows without it, that shit would be boring
'Cause everyone needs someone to blame
So, I guess you can blame me

[Verse 1]
You only liked me when I was depressed, oh, yeah
Made you feel better when I'm second-best
Now I'm dreamin' of peace and a place to move on
When you sit on your phone hopin' it all goes wrong
When all that I wanted was a real friend (A real friend)
[Pre-Chorus]
All this drama when it's really not that bad
But I can't help you and it really makes me sad

[Chorus]
Everyone needs someone to blame (Oh-oh-oh)
And this time, think it's gonna be me (Oh-oh-oh)
Guess you need another villain for your story
God knows without it, that shit would be boring
'Cause everyone needs someone to blame
So, I guess you can blame me

[Verse 2]
Everyone's laughing, I don't get the joke
Guess seeing me down still gives you some hope
Now I'm hitting your phone, but you're not picking up
Tryna be a good friend, but you don't give a fuck
Oh, please, go play your tiny violin
Flash your puppy dog eyes, but you're not comin' in

[Pre-Chorus]
With all your drama when it's really not that bad
But I can't help you and it really makes me sad

[Chorus]
Everyone needs someone to blame (Oh-oh-oh)
And this time, think it's gonna be me (Oh-oh-oh)
Guess you need another villain for your story
God knows without it, that shit would be boring
'Cause everyone needs someone to blame
So, I guess you can blame me

(Oh-oh-oh)
I guess you can blame me
(Oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Everyone needs someone to blame (Oh-oh-oh)
And this time, think it's gonna be me (Oh-oh-oh)
Guess you need another villain for your story
God knows without it, that shit would be boring
'Cause everyone needs someone to blame
So, I guess you can blame me

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh)
I guess you can blame me
(Oh-oh-oh)
