Heartbreak on the Dancefloor Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pick my poison, and you're right there
With somebody, I look over
You don't even notice that I'm staring
At your body, I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I see the light in your eyes
But you're looking straight through me
Just like you never knew me and I'll
Be alright
But right now I feel like drowning
So I can get you out of my head
[Chorus]
I'm only lonely
Ain't nothing dangerous
But when you don't hold me
It's like, it's like I'm going up
In flames tonight
Nothing, no, nothing, no, nothing feels right
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floor
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floor
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floor

[Verse 2]
I'm alone now, music's playing
But it's silent, in the corner
I wish you would notice
Can't you see me?
Cause I'm begging one last time

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna see the light in your eyes
But you're looking straight through me
Just like you never knew me and I'll
Be alright
But right now I feel like drowning
So I can get you out of my head
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm only lonely
Ain't nothing dangerous
But when you don't hold me
It's like, it's like I'm going up
In flames tonight
Nothing, no, nothing, no, nothing feels right
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floor
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floor
With every sip I need you more
It's a heartbreak on the dance floorEmbed
