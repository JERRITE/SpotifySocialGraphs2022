Mascara Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel soon I will sink into you
What do you think?
'Cause there's still blood in your hair
And I've got the bruise of the year

[Chorus]
But there's something about her long, shady eyes
I'm all about her shade tonight

[Verse 2]
I hate your tattoos
You have weak wrists
But I'll keep you
[Chorus]
'Cause there's something about her long, shady eyes
I'm all about her shade tonight

[Outro]
Well, it's too bad
It's too bad
It's too bad
You're married to meYou might also like4Embed
