Moods Lyrics[Intro]
YoungTN Productions

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately my heart been feelin' cold and I don't love nobody
And I been thuggin' on my own 'cause I don't want nobody
I keep my feelings on the low 'cause I don't trust nobody
If you ain't tryna stay forever, baby, don't come by me

[Chorus]
'Cause like, ooh, I get in my moods
I get in my feelings with them killers in the room
Told me that you love me, I can tell that ain't the truth
Would've counted bands with you, had them bustin' out the roof
[Verse 1]
'Cause if you love me like you say
Then you wouldn't need nobody else
I was posted with them demons with a heater in my belt
Always been my own nigga, I can't be nobody else
Yеah, been a cold winter, I been freezing by myself
I ain't have no timе for you, I was on that grind for you
Told you I would ride for you, thought that I would lie to you
Not nobody that gon' look at you the same way that I adore you
I don't listen to these niggas and bitches, they not loyal
Thought that you was gon' play me and stay but the plot foiled
In the kitchen for some days, I been scraping that pot for you
Let you point in any place, I was spraying that Glock for you
Let 'em disrespect your name
He got chased with them shots for you

[Bridge]
Can you let me hear your voice? Can you tell me is it real?
I ain't never had no choice but to come and chase these mils
Came up on me and you changed, can you tell me what’s the deal?
Everybody actin' strange, movin' funny get you killed

[Verse 2]
When I couldn't find myself, I was looking for you still
You ain't even push yourself, I was pushing for you still
Wasn't giving me your heart but I took it from you still
In a puddle full of pain, I was clutching on my steel
Niggas going through some dark days, dark days
This pain fucking up my heart strings, heart strings
That's why I sit and pop a pill, 'cause every time I think it get real
I see demons in my dreams and it's giving me chills

Lately my heart been feelin' cold and I don't love nobody
And I been thuggin' on my own 'cause I don't want nobody
I keep my feelings on the low 'cause I don't trust nobody
If you ain't tryna stay forever, baby, don't come by me

[Chorus]
'Cause like, ooh, I get in my moods
I get in my feelings with them killers in the room
Told me that you love me, I can tell that ain't the truth
Would've counted bands with you, had them bustin' out the roof6Embed
