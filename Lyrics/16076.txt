When It Comes Lyrics[Refrain]
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again

[Verse 1]
When it comes, it comes abrupt
And it feels, it feels like trading brains with an imbecile, for real
Yes, I feel emphatic about not being static
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me at a steal
[Pre-Chorus]
Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy

[Chorus]
No, what I'm looking for cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying
'Cause what I want and what I need
Is and will always will be free, now

[Refrain]
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again

[Verse 2]
When it comes, it comes unannounced
And it feels like a matador is taunting me
With his reddest red cloth and I am the bull
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me no more
'Cause now I'm full

[Pre-Chorus]
Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy
You might also like[Chorus]
No, what I'm looking for cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying
'Cause what I want and what I need
Is and will always will be free, now

[Outro]
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again1Embed
