Blue Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked silver in the night

[Chorus]
Singing, "Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo"
Out there, I'm a sharp knife

[Bridge]
Are you that blue light? Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light? Are you?
[Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo
Doo (Doo doo-doo-doo), doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-dooYou might also like9Embed
