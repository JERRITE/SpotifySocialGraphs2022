Banglez Ting Lyrics[Intro: Giggs]
Turn up the headphones, man
(Steel Banglez)
Yeah
Chyeah, let's do it

[Verse: Giggs]
Kick a door, got it in a figure four
What you saying, rich or poor?
We ain’t playing with the score
Got 'em laying on the floor
Yeah, I'm never running out of ideas
’Bout to get it cracking on America
I haven't been there in 'bout nine years
Driver slide gears
I've seen shit that'd make you cry tears (Trust)
Can't turn the clocks back
Yeah, but give it time and hope the mind clears
Mouths wide
Yeah, these niggas hungry and they're outside
Yeah, we can't trust ’em, so we out spies
Swatting niggas like flies
You love gossip and you like lies
That bitch cocky, but I like shy
I’ve got proper niggas like sky
Pop a nigga like, "Bye"
Shit, where's the weed gone?
Shit’s getting, bitch get your freak on
Punched up and knocked out, where's your street gone?
That's something that Giggs wouldn't speak on
Yeah, you defend spy
Got the MAC for your ten stripes
In the back, in the Denz White
Was in the trap with Uncle Ben’s rice
You should know men's ability
Big cheques, Hollow got grown man stability
Yeah, you're stuck in your programme facility
Jokers, niggas are joke mans, they mimic me (Ha-ha-ha)
She was angry with man, but forgiven me
I'm done with these dumb yutes' stupidity
Moist yutes up in my ear, that's humidity (Ah)
Smash, that's your picture broke (Broke)
Different strokes for different folks, we was whipping dough (Whipping dough)
Be specific, but you sissies won't
We just skip it, use a skipping rope
Dipping, Hollow dipping low (Low)
Pool party (Yeah), I might dip a toe (Yeah)
Hollow, Joe Grind, watch these niggas grow (Grow)
That's some bigger Giggs and a bigger Joe (Joe)
Last year, Wembley, want a bigger show (Show)
I want bigger bread (Yeah), I want Jigga dough (Yeah)
Still that nigga, though
Yeah, she was waving from the middle row (Ah)
Who's that in that nigga's throne? (Ah)
She's not interested, leave that bitch alone (Ah)
Hollowman certaintly, watch that nigga roam (Roam)
That's not even ends, he's not even home
Mash force
Little brother in a black Porsche
Hollow dripping, that's sauce
I could take you on a crash course
So what you sipping?
