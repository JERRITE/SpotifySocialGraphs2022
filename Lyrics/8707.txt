Love Too Good LyricsOooah spread your wings
You've been too long in the cage
Feling the rage of abuses
Oh, i'm sorry

I've opened the door
I've set you free
But can't you see
That I'm no good I'm sorry

Sorry
Baby I still love ya
Sorry
And I worry about it
Sorry
The hurt I put on you
You can do without it
Love too good
You gotta
Love too good
You gotta
Love too good
For a woman like me, baby

Take to the wind
Here there's too much pain
Over and over again
I'll hurt you
I'm sorry

I've opened the door
And I'll set you free
But you still can't see
That I'm no good
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry
Baby, I still love ya
Sorry
And I worry about it
Sorry
The hurt I put on you
You can do without it
You might also likeLove too good
You gotta
Love too good
You gotta
Love too good
For a woman like me
For a woman like me, babyEmbed
