Cat Scratch Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, they hating, but they don't know me
Been a long time, but I'm still lonely
Late night work cause I don't know peace
Everybody else, man, sound phony
Yeah, I'm the one that no one understands
Don't you walk up to me, don't you shake my fucking hand
Labels think that I'ma be the biggest in demand
But I hate authority, so I said fuck the man
[Chorus]
I wonder how it's gonna go down
With a gunshot wound or a tight-knit noose
I don't think I have that long to be around
Slip my head right through, watch my face turn blue
But the city lights take away the pain
When the check comes through, it'll be past due
And the cinder in my soul has come aflame
So when I make that move, hope I don't have you

[Verse 2]
Because I'm better off alone, I'm better by myself
I'm better thanks to people that I used to ask for help
I'm better than the rest, fuck everybody else
I'm better cause I never had a little bit of help
'Cause I'm better off alone, I'm better by myself
I'm better thanks to people that I used to ask for help
I'm better than the rest, fuck everybody else
I'm better cause I never had a little bit of help

[Bridge]
Почему я жив?
Веревка лежит
Царапает как кот
Наверх, как самолет, aye
I wonder how it's gonna go down
I wonder how it's gonna go down
I wonder how it's gonna go down, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I wonder how it's gonna go down
With a gunshot wound or a tight-knit noose
I don't think I have that long to be around
Slip my head right through, watch my face turn blue
But the city lights take away the pain
When the check comes through, it'll be past due
And the cinder in my soul has come aflame
So when I make that move, hope I don't have you8Embed
