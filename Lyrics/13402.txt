Racetrack Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heavy heart's always under attack
Running in circles around the race track
Rose-colored lenses eventually crack
But if you left leaving, I'd let you right back

[Verse 2]
Love is but a game of give and chase
What is a runner without a big race?
The harder I try to keep up with the pace
I always wind up in second place
[Keyboard Interlude]

[Outro]
And even the moon can't maintain the same phase
I always wind up in second placeYou might also like2Embed
