In the Name of Tragedy LyricsWere you ever lost?
Were you ever young?
Were you ever safe, little brother?
Do you see the sense of the evidence?
Are you still part of the struggle?

Did you bang your head?
Did you go to bed?
Does it still feel pretty funky?
Lay back and dream
In the death machine
Pity you still think like a monkey
Bring it up, bring it down
Till you hit the ground
Get a rude attitude
Turn the world around
Shall we see?
Shall we disagree?
Sing it all in the name of tragedy

Do you ever lie?
Ever wonder why
Nobody believed you, honey?
What a pretty smile
Drive the people wild
Wonder who ran off with the money

Do you ever change?
Is it gonna rain?
Will it bring you pennies from Heaven?
Do you know the score?
Are you waiting for?
Anxious for the new Armageddon

Live it up, live it down
Till we hit the ground
Cop a rude attitude
From the world around
Shall we see?
Shall we disagree?
Sing it all in the name of tragedy
You might also likeMarbles in your mouth
What's it all about?
Do you know the name of the winner?
If I was to go, would you let it show?
Life is not a TV dinner

If you dream of me, will you ever see?
Do you want a piece of the auction?
If I wasn't sure, would you do it more?
Help me to achieve an erection

Get it up, get it down
Till you hit the ground
Cop a rude attitude
Turn the world around
Shall we see?
Shall we disagree?
All in the name of tragedy

Sing it loud, sing it out
Make the people shout
Get it all, get it on, get it sorted out
Be a seer, be sincere
Can you really see?
All in the name of tragedy1Embed
