3AM in New Orleans Lyrics[Intro: A$AP ANT]
Uh

[Verse 1: A$AP ANT]
I'm 'bout to drum up for my money, like I'm DJ Cannon
I got a stripper bitch, she Spanish, yeah, she in Atlanta
Yeah, I just scored the Wock', I'm 'bout to grab a Fanta
At my show it's like a robbery, they got they hands up
My diamonds like a hockey puck, you need no 3D glasses
I'm moving like I'm Ali, you can nickname me Cassius
I swear to God, I glow at dark, I don't need no flashes
I treat the Audi like a potato, I'ma mash it
I need my gravy in the whip, it's cranberry sauce
Daunte Culpepper, catch the pack, Randy Moss
Paid in full, Richard Porter, pull up in the [?]
Money like the Empire building, stacking tall
[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Diamonds on [?]
Your bitch tryna be picked from the crowd
Pipe down, just a fish in the sea, I seen a hundred thou'
Some are knocked down, some are passed around
OG, hot feet planted on the ground
Cold bottles in the studio, pistols are half a pound
Hit machine, cop a Rollie off my last sixteen
Waive the fee for my dog, that's what's taught to me
Cautiously walk the street, clutchin' car keys
Rolls-Royce parked on the corner where you can't be
This is New Orleans, G's recognize G's
Applaud me, on the floor seats where I was last seenYou might also like1Embed
