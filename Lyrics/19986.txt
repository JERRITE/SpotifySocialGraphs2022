Memento Mori Lyrics[Intro]
I'm all in
I could never forget you if you're fallin'
I'll be here waiting to catch you, I'm all in
I could never forget you if you're fallin'

[Verse]
I know I already told you
I won't say it again
I'll be the one that'll hold you
You'll be my only friend
I'll make it all worth the time
We both know life has to end
Let's act like love lasts forever
We could both play pretend
[Chorus]
I'll be here standing next to you
When you feel down and out
I always want the best for you
I'll always be around
I'll be here standing nеxt to you
I hope you know I'm proud
And if I leave bеfore you do
Just listen to the sound

[Post-Chorus]
Of my voice singing this song to you
I'll never let you down
I wanna see this through
And if I'm not around
I'll still be there with you
I'll always be a heart beating away

[Verse]
I know I already told you
I won't say it again
I'll be the one that'll hold you
You'll be my only friend
I'll make it all worth the time
We both know life has to end
Let's act like love lasts forever
We could both play pretend

[Chorus]
I'll be here standing next to you
When you feel down and out
I always want the best for you
I'll always be around
I'll be here standing next to you
I hope you know I'm proud
And if I leave before you do
Just listen to the sound

[Outro]
Of my voice singing this song to you
I'll never let you down
I wanna see this through
And if I'm not around
I'll still be there with you
I'll always be a heart beating awayEmbed
