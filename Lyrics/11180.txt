(Iâ€™d Go The) Whole Wide World LyricsWhen I was a young boy, mama she said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you, and she probably lives Tahiti
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas, where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weepin' away in the tropical night, because nobody's told her 'bout you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, to find out where they hide her
Yeah!
Why am I hangin' around in the rain out here
Tryin' to think of a girl?
Why are my eyes fillin' up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?

Or is she lyin' on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun?
Hidin' away in the heat wave there
Hopin' that I won't be long

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, to find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world, to find out where they hide her
Yeah!
I'd go the whole wide world...You might also like1Embed
