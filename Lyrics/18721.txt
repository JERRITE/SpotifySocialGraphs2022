Masquerade of Madness Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is a girl in misery
And insanity
Painting figures on her walls
Those voodoo dolls

[Pre-Chorus]
I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number 9

[Chorus]
Masquerade of madness
Masquerade of sadness
Madness
[Verse 2]
There is a masque for all the dead
And a masque for pain
You gotta leave your mind behind
Don't go insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number 9

[Chorus]
Masquerade of madness
Masquerade of sadness
Madness

[Bridge]
And when they come for you tonight
Darkness of the mind
Keep on the masque they made for you
Only speak inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number 9

[Chorus]
Masquerade of madness
Masquerade of sadness
