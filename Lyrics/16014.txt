Break This Down Lyrics[Verse 1: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Both]
It's time to  bring it together
Time for a brand new start
We gonna put it in motion
Break down what keeps us apart
No more, no division we down
New team, got the vision, unite
So we stand, now we living marching

[Pre-Chorus: Dove Cameron, China Anne McClain, Both]
In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (You see me)
Imperfect (Perfectly)
Face to face we can see clearly our similarities
Like day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time
[Chorus 1: All]
We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Let's be whoever like this
Stronger together like this

[Verse 2: China Anne McClain, Jadah Marie, Thomas Doherty, China & Thomas, *Sofia Carson*, -Cameron Boyce-, +Booboo Stewart+]
Believing in second chances
And we're all starting today
Marching on in a new land
Our world's a better, a better place
*Welcome, the addition new love*
-Unity, new beginning for us-
+Harmony that's the mission marching+

[Pre-Chorus: Core 4, Pirate Crew & Jadah Marie, All]
In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (You see me)
Imperfect (Perfectly)
Face to face we can see clearly our similarities
Like day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time

[Chorus 2: All]
We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this
We reunited like this
[Bridge: All, Dove Cameron]
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down (Down!)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2: All, Sofia Carson, China Anne McClain]
We're gonna break this down (Break this down)
We're gonna rock the town (Oh, we're gonna rock this town)
Everyone all around (Oh, around)
Just be whoever like this (Come on!)
Stronger together like this (Uh)
We reunited like this

[Chorus 2: All, Sofia Carson, China Anne McClain, Dove Cameron]
We're gonna break this down (Come on! We're gonna break this down)
We're gonna rock the town (Come on, *everybody on the isle gonna like this*)
Everyone all around (Oh, around)
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this (Stronger together like this)
We reunited like this (Hey!)
