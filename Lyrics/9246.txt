A Lil’ Ain’t Enough LyricsOw, yeah
Wow
Ah yeah
Whoo

Empty pockets never stopped me from a-singing a blue streak, no
And I don't think the devil's ever gonna give me back
I don't think so

And stayin' 'round here takes patience
It's like a full time occupation
I've become a diplomaniac
Yes I did, baby
Hey mean old gal
You know the crosstown bus just rolled
Yeah I'm the same old number
But we still got time to go, oh, sing it babe

Oh, I say mama, living ain't a luxury, no
Oh, I say mama, and a lil' ain't enough for me
No it ain't, no it ain't, baby

Yeah, I'm believing that you're needin' your relaxation, whoa
But honey, tell me can you tell that story twice?
I don't think so, mama

'Cause there's a function at the junction
Think you better get it all ready girl
See I was born without a silver spoon
But I'm gonna make a stir, yes I am

Was vaccinated with a phonograph needle one summer break, oh
Then I kissed her on her daddy's boat and shot across the lake
And I was singin', babe

Oh, I say mama, living ain't a luxury, no
Oh, I say mama, and a lil' ain't enough for me, no
Oh, I say mama, living ain't a luxury, no oh
Oh, I say mama, and a lil' ain't enough for me
No it ain't baby, no it ain't
You might also likeMmm, said a little ain't enough, baby
Baby, please
Little ain't enough, ow

Heh, heh
Whoo

Was vaccinated with a phonograph needle one summer break
Same summer that I kissed her on her daddy's boat
And shot across the lake
Yeah

Oh, I say mama, say living ain't a luxury, oh
Oh, I say mama, that's a lil' ain't enough for me, oh yeah
Oh, I say mama, living ain't a luxury
(Oh, I say mama) Say, say a lil' ain't enough
A lil' ain't enough for me, ohEmbed
