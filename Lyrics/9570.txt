Trick Look At Me Now (Club Mix) LyricsSee I Had This Girl, Right
And All Through Our Relationshio
She Would Just Tell Me About
How I'm Not Gon' Be Nothin' With My Music Career
And Then She Would Run And Tell Her Friends
Like He's Not This, He's Not That
He Can't Do This And Bla Bla Bla's
That's Where It Got To The Point, Where I Said, What The Fck Man?
Like You Actin' Like I Ain't Desperate For You Man, Just A Lil' Loyalty...
So I Just Told Her Like
Ay...
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em 'Bout The Gucci That I Bought Cha'
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em 'Bout The Coach That I Bought Cha'
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em 'Bout The Phones That I Bought Cha'
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em It Ain't Matter What The Cost Was
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em You Don't Give A Fck About Me
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em You Was Tryna Get The Money Off Me
T-t-t-t-tell 'Em You Told Me I Would Be Nothin'
T-t-t-t-tell Me Why, Tell Me Why, You Out Here Blurtin'
I Was Tryna Tell You Baby
You Didn't Believe, And Now You're Gon' See This Day
Cause I'm At The Top, I Can't Stop, And Not In Your Gucci Car
I Don't Wanna Be With You
Cause I'm Livin' So Fckin' Hard, Babe...
I Told You
I Told You
I Told You
I Would Be Famous Baby
You Told Me
You Told Me
You Told Me
That I Was Crazy Baby
Trick Look At Me Now
Trick, Trick, Look At Me Now
Trick, Look At Me Now
Trick, Look At Me Now
H-h-h-h-hold The Fck Up Up
(Wait A Minute)
I'm In The VP, And Could I Talk To You For A Minute
You Act Like I Would, When I Lose, I'll Fill It To The Ceilin', And You Start Sheverin'...
I Told You
You Laughed At This, To Come Back And Haunt Cha, Puttin' You On Blast
Like I Don't Want Cha
But What Happened To The Promises, Promises, That We Made
Okay, You've Changed
But This All I Gotta Say...
Trick Trick, Look At Me Now
I'm Flashin' On The Camera
Turn On The Television
I'm On Every Channel

My Chain For The Stone
