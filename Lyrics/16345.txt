The Star of a Story LyricsAngel
Come to me, let me be
Part of all the love you are
Cause angel
We could fly, you and I
Ride a rainbow to the stars

So hold me all through the night
Stay till the day is bright
And angel don't ever break the spell
'Cause you're the star of a story I'll always tell
Angel
Used to say, yesterday
Love was only in a dream
But angel
I was wrong, all along
Just took you to make me see

So hold me all through the night
Stay till the day is bright
And angel don't ever break the spell
'Cause you're the star of a story I love so well

So hold me all through the night
Stay till the day is bright
And angel don't ever break the spell
'Cause you're the star of a story I'll always tell

'Cause you're the star of a story I love so well

'Cause you're the star of a story I'll always tell

'Cause you're the star of a story I'll always tellYou might also likeEmbed
