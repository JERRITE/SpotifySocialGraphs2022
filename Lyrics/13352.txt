Poacherâ€™s Pride Lyrics[Verse 1]
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I let it bleed
Made it into taxidermy, hung it on my wall
On my wall

[Verse 2]
I shot an angel, kept it in my backyard
Hung it out to dry on the clothing line
Pinned above my bed
Like the cross of Jesus Christ
On my wall
[Verse 3]
And I know one day, Hell will catch up with me
And I'm sure that I will burn eternally
One day, it will come to claim its pound of flesh
When it's done, there won't be anything left

[Outro]
I shot an angel, dragged it to my basement
Starved it till it died and I did not cry
