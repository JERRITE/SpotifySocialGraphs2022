God Sent Lyrics[Verse]
I'm in my feelings like woah
You cannot come to my show
Callin' my phone like you know
You wouldn't leave it alone
I'm askin' you to play nice
Let's not pretend you are nice
You just don't want me to smile
It's been that way for a while

[Chorus]
But I've been on my God-sent (God-sent)
I've been movin' mountains (Mountains)
Been fuckin' and been grounded (Grounded)
In love with my surroundings (My surroundings)
Can't fuck with me, you so small (You so small)
Our love, it was a close call (Close call)
Itâ€™s ok, you fucked upYou might also like1Embed
