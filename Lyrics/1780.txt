Miss Summer Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again

[Verse]
Every night, I recall this same love (On and on again)
Although my dreams are all she's made of (On and on again)
Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
[Chorus]
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on againYou might also like1Embed
