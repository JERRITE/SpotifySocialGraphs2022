Zoe Jane Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I want you to notice
To notice when I'm not around
I know that your eyes see straight through me
And speak to me without a sound

[Chorus]
And I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter
[Verse 2]
When I walked out this morning
I cried as I walked to the door
I cried about how long I'd be away for
I cried about leaving you all alone

[Chorus]
And I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter

[Bridge]

Sweet Zoe Jane

[Verse 3]
So I wanted to say this
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
To explain to you what I have been through
To explain where your daddy has been

[Chorus]
So I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter
