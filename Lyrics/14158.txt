Chains of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Makin' the notion, we'll never swim
Get you more work than you ever planned
Give me some time now to settle down
I got a new world to wrap this head around

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach & Flor De Toloache]
I had a cold companion
I was her net to land in
She knew what she was doin'
I felt a storm was brewin'
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
[Verse 2]
Tell you the reason I go alone
'Cause even the dead seem to do me wrong
Tell you my secrets
You tell me your lies
Keep you clean just like an alibi

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach & Flor De Toloache]
I had a cold companion
I was her net to land in
She knew what she was doin'
I felt a storm was brewin'
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of love
Chains, the chains, of loveYou might also likeEmbed
