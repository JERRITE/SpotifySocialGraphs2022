A Devil More Damned Lyrics(A devil more damned)
(A devil more damned)

Hold on tight
Keep moving to the light
Don't fall so behind
It's a long cold night
Dark questions
Keep poor company
Like misery becomes apathy
Like why was I born
Why was I born
So lost
So lost
A devil more damned than me

Look to the sky
You can feel God's eye
Did you know it's gonna burn us down
We can laugh
They can cry
While we walk or defy
I wonder where are those saviors now

Let me tell you
I tried
Like you wouldn't believe
But my soul still itches
When I scratch the need
Bitch, make the call
If it's all on the wall
Let if fall
Feed the swine
One king at a time

All my sins have been worthwhile
Like toys in the hands of an angry child
You might also likeHold on tight
Keep moving to the light
Don't fall so behind
It's a long cold night
Dark questions
Keep poor company
Like misery becomes apathy

Like why was I born
Why was I born
So lost
So lost
A devil more damned than me
A devil more damned than me
A devil, a devil more damned than me
A devil more damned than me
A devil more damned than me

(A devil more damned than me)
(A devil more damned than me)
(A devil more damned than me)

I know now
Nothing more starts a war
Than words about worship
Yes, I'm sure that you've heard it
Before you fly off to sell my soul away
Let me auction all your sick praise
All my sins have been worthwhile
Like toys in the hands of an angry child

Hold on tight
Keep moving to the light
Don't fall so behind
It's a long cold night
Dark questions
Keep poor company
Like misery becomes apathy

Like why was I born
Why was I born
So lost
So lost
A devil more damned than me

Fall in line
I'm the last
Every sinner has a future
Every saint has a past
Fall in line
I'm the last
Every sinner has a future
Every saint has a past
Fall in line
I'm the last
Every sinner has a future
Every saint has a past
Fall in line
I'm the last
Every sinner has a future
Every saint has a past

A devil more damned
A devil more damned
A devil more damned than me
A devil more damned
A devil more damned
A devil more damned than me

Hold on tight
Keep moving to the light
Don't fall so behind
It's a long cold night
Dark questions
Keep poor company
Like misery becomes apathy

Like why was I born
Why was I born
So lost
So lost
A devil more damned
A devil more damned than meEmbed
