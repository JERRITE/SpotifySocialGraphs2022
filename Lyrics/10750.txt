AMERICAN GURL Lyrics[Verse 1]
No guts
No glory
Same old figure
But different story
Can't believe
I bought what you sold me
Just a little more
Stands before me
So I run
[Chorus]
Who are you, baby?
Who are you keeping around?
I'm changing places
So I can't see you anymore
Who are you, baby?
Will I know your fate?
In a locked box
In a locked drawer
Will I find me an
American girl
American girl

[Verse 2]
Follow the leader
Bit the apple
Mastered the teacher
Broken shackles
Hang in the breezes
Heavy hearted
And hardly breathing
I just run (Just run)

[Chorus]
Who are you, baby? (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Who are you keeping around? (Around, around, around, around)
I'm changing places (Changing, changing, changing places)
So I can't see you anymore (No more)
Who are you, baby? (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Will I know your fate?
In a locked box
In a locked drawer
Will I find me an
American girl
American girl

Makes me feel like flying
Drugged down backseat
Driving
Dusty road, all alone
Take my hand
Perfect smoke, smoke
Makes me feel like flying-ing-ing-ing
I just run (Just run)

[Chorus]
Who are you, baby? (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Who are you keeping around? (Around, around, around, around)
I'm changing places (Changing, changing, changing places)
So I can't see you anymore (No more)
Who are you, baby? (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Will I know your fate?
In a locked box
In a locked drawer
Will I find me an
American girl
American girl

[Outro]
And I'm gone away, gone away (Ooh)
I don't see your face, see your face (Ooh)
And I'm gone away, gone away
I don't know nothing (Ooh, ooh)
And I'm gone away, gone away
I don't see your face
I'm tired of runnin'
In a locked box
In a locked drawer
In a locked drawer
Will I find me an
American girl
American girl1Embed
