U-RITE (Rynx Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: Drew & Dante]
When you put it like that, like that, like that, like that, you right
Nigga think he got it like that, wanna act like that, alright, alright
I'm about to have to backtrack, backtrack, track off that, you right
You right (when you put it like that, like that, like that)

[Pre-Break: Drew & Dante]
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
You right, you right, like that, like that
[Break: Drew & Dante]
When you put it like that, like that
When you put it like that, you right, you right
(Bitch!) You right, you right
You right, you right
When you put it like that, like-

[Verse 1: Drew & Dante]
Already know what you want
Bitch, why you keep hitting my phone?
Fuck wit' a nigga before, just wait 'til I get in my zone
Fuck all this silly talk
Marvin (momma) told me never hit it raw
Certain shit a nigga pick up on
You cannot trick me, the jig is up (the jig is up, the jig is up)
(Rule 1!) Never ever give a bitch a clue what you really tryna get into (Two!)
Both her friends wanna come with me, tell her good things always come in 3s (Three!)
Can't let you walk out that door 'til you show me what that pussy hittin' for (Four!)
Not tryna fuck up the vibe, but you got be out by a quarter to 5, hoe (Five, five!)

[Chorus: Drew & Dante]
When you put it like that, like that, like that, like that, you right
Nigga think he got it like that, wanna act like that, alright, alright
I'm about to have to backtrack, backtrack, track off that, you right
You right (when you put it like that, like that, like that)
