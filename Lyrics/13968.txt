I Always Knew Lyrics[Verse 1]
Down, down in my bones
Somewhere I'd never have known
Right at the back of my head
It hit me like a beam of light
Hit me like a hook of the right
And I could have fell to the floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause you talk to me and it comes off the wall
You talk to me and it goes over my head
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel
[Chorus]
'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you

[Verse 2]
I try my best to unwind
Nothing on my mind but you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oblivious to all that I'll owe
I'm hanging on to what I don't know
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you
Yeah, it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you

[Chorus]
Well, it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's you
Oh, I knew
Oh, I always knew
Yes, I always knew
Oh, it's you9Embed
