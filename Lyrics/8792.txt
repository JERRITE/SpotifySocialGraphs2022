Children of the Revolution Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well you can bump and grind
It is good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out

[Chorus]
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no
[Verse 2]
Well you can Terraplane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls-Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice

[Chorus]
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no

Yeah

[Chorus]
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No way!You might also like1Embed
