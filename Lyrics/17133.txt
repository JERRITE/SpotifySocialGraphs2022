Birthplace Lyrics[Verse 1]
Be it at your best
It's still our nest
Unknown a better place
Narrow your breath
From every guess
I've drawn my birthplace

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't need a friend
I won't let it in again
[Verse 2]
Be at my best
And I fall, obsessed in all its memory
And dove out to our death, to be undressed
A love, in birth and reverie

[Chorus]
I don't want a friend
I won't let it in again
I don't need a friend
I won't let it in again

[Outro]
Here, at my best
It's all at rest
And I found a better placeYou might also like1Embed
