Rage is a quiet thing
Ooh, you think that you've tamed it
But it's just lying in wait
Rage, is it in our veins?
Feel it in my face when
When I least expect it

[Refrain]
Give in
[Chorus]
Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Control
There's so many ways to give in
Eyes closed
Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down

[Verse 2]
If I had seen my reflection
As something more precious
He would've never
Mmm, and if my child needed protection
From a fucker like that man
I'd sooner gut him
'Cause nothing cuts like a mother
