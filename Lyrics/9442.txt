Love Will Find a Way Lyrics[Verse 1: Kiara]
In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love will find a way
Anywhere I go, I'm home
If you are there beside me
[Chorus]
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

[Verse 2: Kovu]
I was so afraid, now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes

[Kovu and Kiara]
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

[Pre-Chorus: Kovu and Kiara]
They'd know love will find a way
Anywhere we go, we're home
If we are there together

[Chorus: Kovu and Kiara]
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way
I know love will find a wayYou might also likeEmbed
