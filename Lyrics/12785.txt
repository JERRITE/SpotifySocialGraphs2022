Would You Mind Lyrics[Intro: Zion, All]
If I pulled you closer, would you mind?
Would you mind? Would you mind?
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Brandon]
Say you don't catch feelings, say you ain't the love type
I'ma have to work, then, (uh) the whole night
Nothing like your ex, no, this ain't what you used to
Just give me that chance, girl, (uh) won't lose you
[Pre-Chorus: Zion & Austin]
And I know you've been hurt before, but
I'll make it better for ya
I'll make it better for ya, for ya (ow!)
And you heard it all before, but
I've got a question for ya, I've got a question

[Chorus: All]
If I pulled you closer, would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
If my hands get lower when we grind
When we grind, would you mind?
If I pulled you closer, would you

[Verse 2: Zion, All]
Let's not waste a moment
Ain't no need to be shy
I got room for your friends
If your friends want a ride (Ahh)
Tell them not to stress, though (Oh)
I'll treat you so special (special)
Just give me that chance, girl, and
I won't let go

[Pre-Chorus: Edwin &  Austin]
And I know you've been hurt before, but
I'll make it better for ya
I'll make it better for ya, for ya (ow!)
And you heard it all before, but
I've got a question for ya, I've got a question

If I pulled you closer, would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
If my hands get lower when we grind
When we grind, would you mind?
If I pulled you closer, would you

[Bridge: Brandon, Austin & All]
Mind, mind, (c'mon) mi-i-ind
Tell me, baby, would you mind?
Tell me, baby, would you mind? (aye, aye)
Mind, mind, mi-i-ind
Tell me, baby, would you mind?
Tell me, baby, would you mind?

[Pre-Chorus: Nick & Brandon]
Girl, I know you've been hurt before, but
I'll make it better for ya
I'll make it better for ya, for you
I'll make it better

[Chorus: All, Edwin, Brandon]
If I pulled you closer, would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
If my hands get lower when we grind
When we grind, would you mind?
(Oh!
Tell me would you mind, girl)
If I pulled you closer, would you mind?
(I know you've been hurt before, but)
Would you mind?
(I'll make it better for ya)
Would you mind?
(I'll make it better for ya, oh oh oh, babe)
If my hands get lower when we grind
(And you heard it all before, but)
When we grind
(I got a question for ya)
Would you mind?
(I got a question)
If I pulled you closer, would you mind? (babe)
(Mind, mind, mi-i-ind)30Embed
